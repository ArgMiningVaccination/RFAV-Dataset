No action has been taken on anything herein contained, and it is informational only. Only those items that have been acted on finally by the House can be considered official. REM INDER : Only the Resolve portions of the resolutions are considered by the House of Delegates. The Whereas portions or preambles are informational and explanatory only. UNDERSTANDING THE RECORDING OF AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION POLICY Current American Medical Association (AMA) policy is catalogued in PolicyFinder, an electronic database that is updated after each AMA House of Delegates (HOD) meeting and available online. Each policy is assigned to a topical or subject category. Those category headings are alphabetical, starting with \"abortion\" and running to \"women\"; the former topic was assigned the number 5, and \"women\" was assigned 525. Within a category, policies are assigned a 3 digit number, descending from 999, meaning that older policies will generally have higher numbers within a category (eg, 35.999 was initially adopted before 35.984). A policy number is not affected when it is modified, however, so a higher number may have been altered more recently than a lower number. Numbers are deleted and not reused when policies are rescinded. AMA policy is further categorized into one of four types, indicated by a prefix: \"H\" - for statements that one would consider positional or philosophical on an issue \"D\" - for statements that direct some specific activity or action. There can be considerable overlap between H and D statements, with the assignment made on the basis of the core nature of the statement. \"G\" - for statements related to AMA governance \"E\" - for ethical opinions, which are the recommendations put forward in reports prepared by the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs and adopted by the AMA-HOD AMA policy can be accessed at ama-assn.org/go/policyfinder . The actions of the AMA-HOD in developing policy are recorded in the Proceedings , which are available online as well. Annotations at the end of each policy statement trace its development, from initial adoption through any changes. If based on a report, the annotation includes the following abbreviations: BOT - Board of Trustees CME - Council on Medical Education CCB - Council on Constitution and Bylaws CMS - Council on Medical Service CEJA - Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs CSAPH - Council on Science and Public Health CLRPD - Council on Long Range Planning and Development If a resolution was involved, \"Res\" is indicated. The number of the report or resolution and meeting (A for Annual; I for Interim) and year (two digits) are also included (eg, BOT Rep. 1, A-14 or Res. 319, I-12). AMA policy is recorded in the following categories, and any particular policy is recorded in only a single category. 5.000 Abortion 10.000 Accident Preventi on/Unintentional Injuries Syndrome 25.000 Aging 30.000 Alcohol and Alcoholism 35.000 Allied Health Professions 40.000 Armed Forces 45.000 Aviation Medicine 50.000 Blood 55.000 Cancer 60.000 Children and Youth 65.000 Civil and Human Rights 70.000 Coding and Nomenclature 75.000 Contraception 80.000 Crime 85.000 Death and Vital Substitution 135.000 Environmental Health 140.000 Ethics 145.000 Firearms: Safety and Regulation 150.000 Foods and Nutrition Page 2 155.000 Health Care Costs 160.000 Health Care Delivery 165.000 Health Care/System Reform 170.000 Health Education 175.000 Health Fraud 180.000 Health Insurance 185.000 Health Insurance: Benefits and Coverage 190.000 Health Insurance: Claim Forms and Claims Processing 195.000 Health Maintenance Organizations 200.000 Health Workforce 205.000 Health Planning 210.000 Home Health Services 215.000 Hospitals Accreditation Standards Hospitals: Medical Staff - Credentialing Privileges 235.000 Hospitals: Medical Staff - Organization 240.000 Hospitals: Reimbursement 245.000 Infant Health 250.000 International Health 255.000 International Medical Graduates 260.000 Laboratories 265.000 Legal Medicine 270.000 Legislation and Regulation 275.000 Licensure and Discipline 280.000 Long -Term Care 285.000 Managed Care 290.000 Medicaid and State Children's Health Insurance Programs 295.000 Medical Educat ion 300.000 Medical Education: Continuing 305.000 Financing and Support 310.000 Medical Education: Graduate 315.000 Medical Records and Patient Privacy 320.000 Medical Review 330.000 Medicare 335.000 Medicare: Carrier PRO 345.000 Health 350.000 Minorities 355.000 National Practitioner Data Bank 360.000 Nurses and Nursing 365.000 Occupational Health 370.000 Organ Donation and Transplantation 373.000 Patients 375.000 Peer Review 380.000 Physic ian Fees 383.000 Negotiation Physician Payment Payment: - Physicians Physician -Specific Health Care Data 410.000 Practice Parameters 415.000 Preferred Provider Arrangements 420.000 Pregnancy and Childbirth 425.000 Preventive Medicine 430.000 Prisons 435.000 Professional Liability 440.000 Public Health 445.000 Public Relations 450.000 Quality of Care 455.000 Radiation and Radiology 460.000 Research 465.000 Rural Health 470.000 Sports and Physical Fitness 475.000 Surgery 478.000 Technology - Computer 480.000 Technology - Medical 485.000 Television 490.000 Tobacco Use, Prevention and Cessation 495.000 Tobacco Products 500.000 Tobacco: AMA Corporate Policies and Activities 505.000 Tobacco: Federal and International Policies 510.000 Veterans Medical Care 515.000 Violence and Abuse 520.000 War 525.000 Women 600.000 Governance: AMA House of Delegates 605.000 Governance: AMA Board of Trustees and Officers 610.000 Governance: Nominations, Elections, and Appointments 615.000 Governance: AMA Councils, Sections, and Committees 620.000 Governance: Federation of Medicine 625.000 Governance: Strategic Planning Administration and Programs 635.000 Governance: Membership 640.000 Governance: Advocacy and Political Action LIST OF MATERIAL INCLUDED IN THIS HANDBOOK (A-23) Resolutions and reports have been collated by referral according to reference committee assignment.

history of human civilization has the well -being of each individual been so inextricably linked to that of every other. Plagues and pandemics respe ct no national borders in a world of global commerce and travel. Wars and acts of terrorism enlist innocents as combatants and mark civilians as targets. Advances in medical science and genetics, while promising great good, may also be harnessed as agents of evil. The unprecedented scope and immediacy of these universal challenges demand concerted action and response by all. As physicians, we are bound in our response by a common heritage of caring for the sick and the suffering. Through the centuries, individual physicians have fulfilled this obligation by applying their skills and knowledge competently, selflessly and at times heroically. Today, our profession must reaffirm its historical commitment to combat natural and man -made assaults on the health and well -being of humankind. Only by acting together across geographic and ideological divides can we overcome such powerful threats. Humanity is our patient. Declaration We, the members of the world community of physicians, solemnly commit ourselves to: 1. Respect human life and the dignity of every individual. 2. Refrain from supporting or committing crimes against humanity and condemn all such acts. 3. Treat the sick and injured with competence and compassion and without prejudice. 4. Apply our knowledge and ski lls when needed, though doing so may put us at risk. 5. Protect the privacy and confidentiality of those for whom we care and breach that confidence only when keeping it would seriously threaten their health and safety or that of others. 6. Work freely with co lleagues to discover, develop, and promote advances in medicine and public health that ameliorate suffering and contribute to human well -being. 7. Educate the public and polity about present and future threats to the health of humanity. 8. Advocate for social, economic, educational, and political changes that ameliorate suffering and contribute to human well -being. 9. Teach and mentor those who follow us for they are the future of our caring profession. We make these promises solemnly, freely, and upon our personal and professional honor.

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES B of T Report 15 -A-23 Subject: National Cancer Research Patient Identifier Presented by: Sandra Adamson Fryhofer, MD, Chair Referred to: Reference Committee on Amendments to Constitution and Bylaws Resolution 021- A-22, \"National Cancer Research Identifier,\" sponsored by the Mississippi 1 Delegation, was referred by the House of Delegates. Resolution 021- A-22 asks our AMA to 2 establish: 3 4 \"[The] National Cancer Research Identifier (NCRI) [...] to improve care for patients with 5 cancer.\" 6 7 The NCRI as described would be overseen by a nonprofit entity, and the role of the NCRI would be 8 to collect identifying patient information to create: 9 10 \"a privacy -ensuring, unique cancer research identifier [that] could tr avel with the anonymous 11 fragments of medical information currently collected by large databases, and therefore allow 12 the fragments to be reunited into a complete, yet anonymous cancer journey that researchers 13 can study to improve care\". 14 15 The summary of te stimony from A -22 acknowledges concerns regarding the creation of the NCRI 16 and recommends Resolution 021 for referral . Testimony was strongly in support of referral , noting 17 the complexity of the issue, i.e., a national identifier may exclude some people fr om clinical trials, 18 may dissuade some people with privacy concerns from joining trials, may put undue burdens (e.g., 19 further EHR responsibilities) on some physicians, and it may implicate privacy, trust, and 20 surveillance concerns. Testimony also noted conc ern about what organizations would be involved 21 in overseeing the NCRI process and questioned why the resolution should be limited to cancer 22 rather than be broader in scope. 23 24 BACKGROUND 25 26 In the US, all 50 states have laws that require newly diagnosed cance rs to be reported to a central 27 cancer registry [ 1]. The CDC's National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) and NCI's 28 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program are the two primary central 29 registries that collect cancer incidence data in the US. Together, the NPCR and the SEER Program 30 collect data from the entire US population, and according to a 2017 joint report by the CDC and 31 NIH, the two comprehensive surveillance systems work collaboratively to collect, compile, and 32 disseminate information on more than 1.7 million cancer cases annually [ 2]. 33 B of T Rep. 15 -A-23 -- page 2 of 4 ALTERNATIVES TO NCRI 1 2 While Resolution 021-A- 22 claims that the formation of the NCRI would \"dramatically increase 3 the speed and power of real- world research\" it is unclear if this would be the case. Using identified 4 data may in fact slow down the research proce ss if the ide ntified data are subject to the Common 5 Rule , which would require researchers using NCRI data to go through IRB approval. Furthermore, 6 as noted in BOT 16 N-21 \"De- Identified Data\" an d Resolution 003-A-18 \"Proposing Consent for 7 De-Identified Patient Information,\" once data has been de-identified, HIPAA no longer applies, 8 which raises potential concerns if certain entities obtain access to the NCRI. This is particularly 9 troubling because of the unequal power between those whose data has been collected and those 10 who control that data, an issue that has been referred to as the \"Big Data Divide\" [ 3]. This is also a 11 threat to justice within clinical research, as data subjects from lower socioeconomic and/or 12 minority backgrounds tend to have even less control over their data and are thus more vulnerable to 13 misuse of their data [ 4]. 14 15 Meanwhile current cancer research is clipping along at a steady pace. A 2020 report by Springer 16 Nature found that \"[t]he number of cancer research articles published in journals listed in the 17 Nature Index increased by 25.8 percent between 2015 and 2019. This is four times the growth for 18 overall article output in this period\" [ 5]. The report also found that the U S's National Cancer 19 Institute (NCI) \"is by far the world's biggest funder of cancer research\" [ 5]. 20 21 Supporting the NCRI's data modernization efforts to move to modern cloud-based systems, 22 working to ensure that data collection is conducted in a just and equitable manner for all peoples, 23 and encouraging physicians to discuss opportunities with cancer patients about participating in 24 cancer research may be more appropriate avenues for our AMA to approach improving cancer 25 research instead of forming the NCRI. 26 27 Our AMA could also seek to promote data and code sharing in oncology research as an alternative 28 means of accomplishing the goal of Resolution 021 . The practice of code sharing involves stating 29 explicitly, in text or supplementary material , in research publications if and where any or all data or 30 code underpinning the results is available for access. A recent research paper found that data and 31 code sharing occur infrequently in oncology despite the prevalence of mandatory sharing policies 32 outlined by publishers; additionally, there is a large gap between oncology researchers who declare 33 their data to be available, and those who actually archive data in a way that facilitates its reuse [ 6]. 34 35 ETHICAL CONCERNS SURROUDING NCRI 36 37 The AMA's Code of Medical Ethics does not explicitly prohibit such a patient identifier so long as 38 the body adheres to the Code's opinions on protecting patient confidentiality, respecting patient 39 privacy, providing appropriate informed consent, and ensuring the data is used in a m anner that 40 promotes justice (s ee Opinion 3.2.1 Confidentiality; Opinion 3.3.2 Confidentiality & Electronic 41 Medical Records; Opinion 3.2.4 Access to Medical Records by Data Collection Companies; 42 Opinion 4.1.3 Third -Party Access to Genetic Information; Opinion 3.1.1 Privacy in Health Care; 43 Opinion 7.3.7 Safeguards in the Use of DNA Databanks; Opinion 2.1.1 Informed Consent; Opinion 44 7.1.2 Informed Consent in Research; Opinion 8.5 Disparities in Health Care). 45 46 However, Policy H-315.962 \"Research Handling of De- Identified Patent Information\" states, 47 \"[o]ur AMA supports efforts to promote transparency in the use of de- identified patent data and to 48 protect patient privacy by developing methods of, and technologies for, de-identification of patient 49 information that reduce the risk of re -identification of such information.\" The collection and use of 50 identified patient data pose several concerns as even de -identified data do not eliminate the risk of 51 B of T Rep. 15 -A-23 -- page 3 of 4 re-identification that can potentially harm patients. The Board observes the Council on Ethical and 1 Judicial Affai rs is in the process of reviewing existing ethics guidance on the use of patient 2 information in research. 3 4 CONCLUSION 5 6 For these reasons, the Board concludes that the creation of a national cancer patient research 7 identifier is neither necessary nor desirable. AMA resources might be better utilized to support data 8 modernization efforts by existing cancer registries, work to ensur e that no groups face barriers to 9 data collection efforts, encourag e physicians to educate and engage patients to participate in 10 existing cancer research, and urge cancer researchers to improve data and code sharing. 11 12 RECOMENDATIONS 13 14 In light of these considerations, your Board of Trustees recommends that the following be adopted 15 in lieu of Resolution 021, A -22, \"National Cancer Res earch Patient Identifier ,\" and the remainder 16 of this report be filed : 17 18 Our AMA encourages greater use of code and data sharing to enhance the timely conduct of 19 research in oncology and implementation of innovations in care. 20 Fiscal Note: Minimal - less th an $500 B of T Rep. 15 -A-23 -- page 4 of 4 REFERENCES 1.

REPORT OF THE COUNCIL ON CONSTITUTION AND BYLAWS CCB Report 01-A-23 Subject: AMA Bylaws --Gender Neutral Language and Miscellaneous Update Presented by: Kevin Reilly, Sr., MD, Chair Referred to: Reference Committee on Amendments to Constitution and Bylaws The AMA Constitution establishes the basic principles of our AMA and the AMA Bylaws provide 1 the framework for the governance and administration of the Association. Our AMA membership, 2 like the population of physicia ns practicing in the United States, has become increasingly diverse . 3 Language plays a major role in shaping culture and social attitudes and gender-neutral language 4 promotes gender equality and inclusivity and eradicate s gender bias ; thus, your Council believes 5 that the AMA Constitution and Bylaws should utilize gender- neutral language , and proposes 6 recommendations for Bylaw amendments for House consideration and action. 7 8 The Merriam -Webster Dictionary recognizes the word 'they' as a singular pronoun, and the AP 9 Manual of Style states that \"th ey/them/their is acceptable in limited cases as a singular and -or 10 gender-neutral pronoun, when alternative wording is overly awkward or clumsy.\" Lastly, the AMA 11 Manual of Style provides the following guidance: \"Avoid sex- specific pronouns in cases in which 12 sex specificity is irrelevant. Do not use common -gender \"pronouns\" (eg, \"s/he,\" \"shem,\" \"shim\"). 13 Reword the sentence to use a singular or plural non -sex-specific pronoun, neutral noun equivalent, 14 or change of voice; or use \"he or use of 15 the \"singular they\" construction is permitted when rewriting would be awkward or unclear .\" 16 17 It also should be noted that w here Bylaw language is included in the Internal Operating Procedures 18 (IOPs) of an AMA section or in the Rules of an AMA Council, those documents will be similarly 19 modified. All sections are or will be modifying their IOPs to make these gender-neutral. 20 21 Lastly, there is one other proposed change un related to gender -neutrality in 7.4.1, which defines the 22 membership of the Organized Medical Staff Section (OMSS). The change in wording from \"Active 23 resident and fellows who have been selected certified by their medical staffs as representatives to 24 the Business Meeting also shall be considered members of the Section,\" mirrors the language in the 25 OMSS I OPs and accurately reflects OMSS practice. 26 27 RECOMMENDATIONS 28 29 The Council on Constitution and Bylaws recommends that the following amendments to the AMA 30 Bylaws be adopted and that the remainder of this report be filed. Adoption requires the affirmative 31 vote of two- thirds of the members of the House of Delegates present and voting. 32 CCB Rep. 01 -A-23 -- page 2 of 4 2\u2014House of Delegates 1 2 **** 3 4 2.8 Alternate Delegates. 5 6 *** 7 8 2.8.6 Status.

REPORT OF THE COUNCIL ON ETHICAL AND JUDICIAL AFFAIRS* CEJA Report 01-A-23 Subject: Utilization Review, Medical Necessity Determination, Prior Authorization Decisions Presented by: Peter A. Schwartz, MD, Chair Referred to: Reference Committee on Amendments to Constitution and Bylaws Policy D-320.977 , \"Utilization Review, Medical Necessity Determination, Prior Authorization 1 Decisions,\" as adopted in June 2022, requests that the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs 2 \"review current ethical opinions similar to the Texas Medical Association (TMA) Board of 3 Councilors' opinions regarding medical necessity determination and utilization review.\" 4 5 The relevant TMA Board of Councilors opinions read as follows: 6 7 MEDICAL NECESSITY.The de termination of medical necessity is the practice of medicine; 8 it is not a benefit determination. Whether or not a proposed treatment is medically necessary 9 should be decided in a manner consistent with generally accepted standards of medical practice 10 that a prudent physician would provide to a patient for the purposes of preventing, diagnosing 11 or treating an illness, injury, disease or its symptoms. This is true even if the physician making 12 the medical necessity determination is making those decisions on be half of a managed care 13 organization. That physician must not permit financial mechanisms to interfere with his/her 14 determination as to whether a treatment is medically necessary. Although the physician may 15 take cost considerations into account, the physician may not refuse to approve the medical 16 necessity of a treatment simply based on cost, and must approve the treatment if it is clearly 17 more therapeutically effective than other treatment options that may be covered under the plan, 18 even if those treatment options are less expensive than their more costly counterpart. 19 20 UTILIZATION REVIEW.The physician who performs prospective and/or concurrent 21 utilization review is obligated to review the request for treatment with the same standard of 22 care as would be req uired by the profession in the community in which the patient is being 23 treated. 24 25 As originally presented to the A merican Medical A ssociation (AMA) House of Delegates, the 26 background resolution asked that Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs ( CEJA ) \"dev ise ethical 27 opinions similar to\" those issued by the TMA Board of Councilors (Resolution 727 A-22). 28 29 The opinions of the TMA maintain that decisions about the appropriateness of recommended 30 interventions are matters of professional medical judgment, not administrative determinations. 31 *Reports of the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs are assigned to the Reference Committee on Amendments to Constitution and Bylaws. They may be adopted, not adopted, or referred. A report may not be amended, except to clarify the meaning of the report and only with the concurrence of the Council. CEJA Rep. 01-A-23 -- page 2 of 3 Thus, physicians charged to determine whether an intervention is medical ly necessary on behalf of 1 health care organizations or third-party payers 2 3 may not refuse to approve treatment based solely on cost considerations ; and 4 must approve treatment that is \"clearly more therapeutically effective\" even if it is costlier 5 than other covered options. 6 7 Physicians who perform utilization review likewise should base determinations on the standard of 8 care prevailing in the professional community. 9 10 The council reviewed existing guidance in the AMA Code of Medical Ethics and concluded that 11 issues raised by the opinions of the TMA are appropriately addressed in several opinions: 12 13 10.1 \" Ethics Guidance for Physicians in Nonclinical Roles \" 14 10.1.1 \" Ethical Obligations of Medical Directors \" 15 11.2.1 \" Professionalism in Health Care Syste ms\" 16 11.2.2 \" Conflicts of Interest in Patient Care \" 17 11.2.3 \" Contracts to Deliver Health Care Services \" 18 11.2.6 \" Mergers of Secular and Religiously Affiliated Health Care Institutions \" 19 11.1.2 \" Physician Stewardship of Health Care Resources \" 20 21 Opinions 10.1 and 10.1.1 maintain that whenever physicians \"use the knowledge and values they 22 gained through medical training . . . in roles that affect the care and well- being\" of patients, 23 physicians are \"functioning within the sphere of their profession\" and must uphold their fiduciary 24 obligations to patients. Opinion 11.2.2 holds patient welfare takes priority over the economic 25 interests of hospitals, health care organizations, and other entities. 26 27 Opinion 11.2.1 s ets out essential conditions for the ethically appropriate design and use of 28 incentives to address health care costs. Rather than address specific mechanisms or strategies, 29 guidance identifies key ethics concerns, particularly conflict of interest and impl ications for 30 physicians' exercise of professional judgment and professionalism. Thus 11.2.1 defines essential 31 conditions for the ethical use of incentives, irrespective of the form such incentives may take: 32 33 ensuring that health care disparities are not exacerbated 34 ensuring that supporting infrastructure and resources are in place to support high quality 35 care and physician professionalism 36 recognizing and respecting physicians' duty to advocate on behalf of pat ients by providing 37 meaningful pathways for appealing denials of care 38 accepting an institutional obligation to monitor the impact of incentives 39 40 Although it speaks less directly to matters of determining medical necessity or utilization review , 41 Opinion 11.2.6 similarly underscores the importance of ensuring that health care institutions adopt 42 mechanisms to enable physicians to appeal constraints in order to meet the unique needs of 43 individual patients and to monitor the impact of policies that constrain reso urce use or the 44 availability of clinical services. 45 46 Finally, Opinion 11.1.2 addresses the position expressed by the TMA that physicians should 47 approve \"clearly more therapeutically effective\" among available options, irrespective of cost. 48 11.1.2 provides t hat physicians should recommend interventions \"demonstrated to meaningfully 49 improve clinical outcomes,\" although when different interventions offer comparable benefits and 50 risks for an individual patient, they should generally prefer those that require few er resources. 51 CEJA Rep. 01-A-23 -- page 3 of 3 The council further noted that amending guidance specifically to address determinations of medical 1 necessity and utilization review as such would not be consistent with the approach taken in 2 modernizing the Code of Medical Ethics . In updating the Code CEJA intentionally reframed 3 guidance to ensure that it remained \"evergreen\" and not tied to specific technologies or practices. 4 The council focused on clarifying the ethical values underlying guidance and for the most part 5 eliminated specific exa mples and content that read as instruction on how to implement guidance. 6 7 Multiple opinions in earlier editions of the Code spoke to particulars of, e.g., capitation, use of 8 restricted medication formularies, and similar issues tied to strategies for cost containment imposed 9 by managed care organizations. In modernizing this guidance CEJA re- organized and consolidated 10 content from multiple opinions to focus on relevant ethics issues, such as conflict of interest and 11 physician professionalism. For example, Opinion 11.2.1, \"Professionalism in Health Care 12 Systems,\" identifies and consolidates guidance from five separate opinions to offer a succinct 13 statement of conditions essential to promoting professionalism in care delivery systems. 14 15 For these reasons, the council concluded that in its present form the AMA Code of Medical Ethics 16 appropriately addresses the fundamental concerns identified in the cited opinions of the TMA 17 Board of Councilors. 18 19 RECOMMENDATION 20 21 Based on the foregoing considerations, t he Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs recommends 22 that paragraph 2 of D-320.977, \"Utilization Review, Medical Necessity Determination, Prior 23 Authorization Decisions,\" be rescinded as having been accomplished and the remainder of this 24 report be filed: 25 26 1. Our AMA will advocate: (a) for implementation of a federal version of a prior authorization 27 \"gold card\" law, which aims to curb onerous prior authorization practices by many state- 28 regulated health insurers and health maintenance organizations; and (b) that health plans should 29 offer physicians at least one physician- driven, clinically -based alternative to prior 30 authorization, including a \"gold- card\" or \" preferred provider program. \" 31 32 2. Our AMA will request that the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs review current 33 ethical opinions similar to the Texas Medical Association Board of Councilors opinions 34 regarding medical necessity determination and utilization review. 35 36 (Modify HOD po licy) 37 Fiscal Note: Less than $500 \u00a9 2023 American Medical Association.

REPORT OF THE COUNCIL ON ETHICAL AND JUDICIAL AFFAIRS* CEJA Report 02-A-23 Subject: Ethical Principles for Physicians Involved in Private Equity Owned Practices Presented by: Peter A Schwartz, MD, Chair MD, Chair Referred to: Reference Committee on Amendments to Constitution and Bylaws Policy D-140.951 , \"Establishing E thical Principles for Physicians Involved in Private Equity 1 Owned Practices,\" instructs our A merican M edical A ssociation (AMA) to 2 3 study and clarify the ethical challenges and considerations regarding physician 4 professionalism raised by the advent and expansion of private equity ownership or 5 management of physician practices and report back on the status of any ethical dimensions 6 inherent in these arrangements, including consideration of the need for ethical guidelines as 7 appropriate. Such a study should e valuate the impact of private equity ownership, 8 including but not limited to the effect on the professional responsibilities and ethical 9 priorities for physician practices. 10 11 This report presents the fruits of deliberations by the Council on Ethical and Jud icial Affairs 12 (CEJA) on the need for ethics guidance in this area. 13 14 The council noted that current guidance in the AMA Code of Medical Ethics (Code) was developed 15 initially to address issues raised by the advent of managed care. Reflecting on the respectiv e 16 challenges posed by managed care and private equity, the council concluded that where managed 17 care organizations focused on goals of cost -containment and improving efficiency of care delivery 18 rather than profitability per se, private equity/venture capit al (PE/VC) investment in health care 19 practices explicitly aims to enhance the profitability of any medical practice in which they invest 20 during the period of their investment and further to realize significant profit when they divest of 21 that practice after a term of years. 22 23 CEJA observed that House policy adopted in 2019 substantially accomplishes the goals sought by 24 D-140.951. Council on Medical Service Report 11-A- 19 carefully reviewed available data on the 25 scope and impact of PE/VC investment in health care. Its recommendations were adopted as H- 26 160.891 , \"Corporate Investors,\" which delineates 11 factors physicians should consider before 27 entering into partnership with corporate investors, including issues of alignment of mission, vision, 28 and goals; the degree to which corporate partners may require physicians to cede control over 29 practice decision making; process for staff representation on the board of directors and medical 30 leadership selection; and retaining medical authority in patient care and supervision of 31 nonphysician practitioners. 32 * Reports of the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs are assigned to the Reference Committee on Amendments to Constitution and Bylaws. They may be adopted, not adopted, or referred. A report may not be amended, except to clarify the meaning of the report and only with the concurrence of the Council. CEJA Rep. 02-A-23 -- page 2 of 3 The AMA further developed and published materials to assist physicians contemplating partnering 1 with PE/VC firms: 2 3 Venture Capital and Private Equity: How to Evaluate Contractual Agreements 4 Model Checklist: Venture Capital and Private Equity Investments 5 Snapshot: Venture Capital and Private Equity Investments 6 7 In the council's view, the salient concerns raised by the engagement of PE/VC firms in health care, 8 notably challenges to physicians' freedom to exercise professional judgment and strategies for 9 reducing cost/enhancing profitability, are addressed in existing guidance in Opinions 11.2.1 , 10 \"Professionalism in Health Care 11.2.3 , \"Contracts to Deliver Health Care Services.\" 12 13 Given the existence of rich House policy on point and the fact that existing opinions in the Code 14 substantially address key issues of concern, the council concluded that guidance specifically 15 addressing PE/VC in health care is not the most effective response. Rather, the council believes 16 that amending current guidance to more clearly encompass partnerships with PE/VC firms would 17 best serve the interests of physicians and the patients they care for. 18 19 RECOMMENDATION 20 21 In view of these deliberations, the Council on Ethical and Judicia l Affairs recommends that 22 Opinion 11.2.3, \"Contracts to Deliver Health Care Services,\" be amended as follows and the 23 remainder of this report be filed: 24 25 Physicians have a fundamental ethical obligation to put the welfare of patients ahead of other 26 consider ations, including personal financial interests. This obligation requires them to that 27 before entering into contracts to deliver health care services physicians consider carefully the 28 proposed contract to assure themselves that the its terms and conditions of contracts to deliver 29 health care services before entering into such contracts to ensure that those contracts do not 30 create untenable conflicts of interests do not obviously compromise their ability to fulfill their 31 fiduciary obligations to patients. 32 33 Ongoing evolution in the health care system continues to bring changes to medicine, including 34 changes in reimbursement mechanisms, models for health care delivery, restrictions on referral 35 and use of services, clinical practice guidelines, and limitations on benefits packages. While 36 these changes are intended to enhance quality, efficiency, and safety in health care, they can 37 also put at risk physicians' ability to uphold professional ethical standards of informed consent 38 and fidelity to patients and can impe de physicians' freedom to exercise independent 39 professional judgment and tailor care to meet the needs of individual patients. 40 41 As physicians seek capital to support their practices or enter into various differently structured 42 contracts to deliver health c are services\u2014with group practices, hospitals, health plans, or other 43 entities \u2014they should be mindful that while many arrangements have the potential to promote 44 desired improvements in care, some arrangements also have the potential to impede put 45 patients' interests at risk 46 47 When contracting partnering with other entities to provide health care services, physicians 48 should: 49 CEJA Rep. 02-A-23 -- page 3 of 3 (a) Carefully review the terms of proposed contracts or have a representative do so on 1 their behalf to assure themselves that the arrangement: 2 3 (i) Minimizes conflict of interest with respect to proposed reimbursement 4 mechanisms, financial or performance incentives, restrictions on care or other 5 mechanisms intended to influence physicians' treatment recommendations or 6 direct what care patients receive, in keeping with ethics guidance. 7 8 (ii) Does not compromise physicians' own financial well-being or ability to provide 9 high-quality care through unrealistic expectations regarding utilization of services 10 or terms that expose t he physician to excessive financial risk. 11 12 (iii) Allows the physician to appropriately exercise professional judgment. 13 14 (iv) Includes a mechanism to address grievances and supports advocacy on behalf of 15 individual patients. 16 17 (v) Permits disclosure to patients. 18 19 (vi) Enables physicians to participate in, if not outright control, decisions about 20 practice staffing. 21 22 (b) Negotiate modification or removal of any terms that unduly compromise physicians' 23 ability to uphold ethical standards. 24 25 When physicians enter into arrang ements with partners who may later sell the practice, 26 physicians should seek explicit commitments that subsequent partners will sustain 27 fidelity to patients and respect physicians' professional ethical obligations. 28 29 (Modify HOD policy) 30 Fiscal Note: Less than $500 \u00a9 2023 American Medical Association.

Schwartz , MD, Chair Referred to: Reference Committee on Amendments to Constitution and Bylaws Short -term medical service trips send physicians and physicians in training from wealthier 1 countries to provide care in resource -limited settings abroad for a period of days or weeks . They 2 have been promoted, in part, as a strate gy for addressing global health inequities , and have 3 unquestionably benefitted thousands of individual patients. At the same time, short -term medical 4 service trips have a problematic history and run the risk of causing harm to the patients and 5 communities they intend to serve [1]. To minimize harm and ensure significant benefit s, 6 volunteers , sponsors, and hosts must jointly prioritize activities to meet mutually agreed -on goals; 7 navigat e day- to-day collaboration across differences of culture, language, and history; and fairly 8 allocat e host and team resources. 9 10 Ethics guidance can neither redress historical wrongs nor solve the underlying structural issues that 11 drive medical need in resour ce-limited settings. However, by making explicit the conditions under 12 which short -term medical service trips are ethically sound and articulating the fundamental ethical 13 responsibilities of those who participate in or sponsor such trips, ethics guidance ca n promote 14 immediate benefit to individuals and sustainable benefit for their communities. In addition, ethics 15 guidance can highlight the ways in which power imbalances and neo-colonial assumptions can 16 shape these practices and so may undermine their moral acceptability. This report by the Council 17 on Ethical and Judicial Affairs (CEJA) explores the challenges of short -term medical service trips 18 and offers guidance for physicians , physicians in training, and sponsors to help them add ress 19 ethical challenges of providing clinical care in resource -limited settings abroad. 20 21 THE APPEAL OF SHORT -TERM MEDICAL SERVICE TRIPS 22 23 Just how many clinicians volunteer to provide medical care in resource -limited settings abroad is 24 difficult to estimate, but the number is large. By one estimate, in the U.S. some 21% of the nearly 3 25 billion dollars' worth of volunteer hours spent in international efforts in 2007 were medically 26 related [ 2]. For trainees, in January 2015 the Consortium of Universiti es for Global Health 27 identified more than 180 websites relating to global health opportunities [ 3]. The Association of 28 American Medical Colleges found that among students who graduated in 2017-2018 between 25% 29 and 31% reported having had some \"global healt h experience\" during medical school [ 4]. 30 31 A variety of reasons motivate physicians and trainees to volunteer for service trips. For many, 32 compelling motivations include the opportunities to help address health inequities, to improve their 33 diagnostic and t echnical skills as clinicians, or to explore global health as a topic of study [ 2]. 34 *Reports of the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs are assigned to the Reference Committee on Amendments to Constitution and Bylaws. They may be adopted, not adopted, or referred. A report may not be amended, except to clarify the meaning of the report and only with the concurr ence of the Council. CEJA Rep. 03- A-23 -- page 2 of 9 Service trips can also serve the goals of building one's resume, improving one's professional 1 prospects, gaining the esteem of peers and family, or simply enjoying internat ional travel [ 2]. 2 3 A NOTE ON TERMINOLOGY 4 5 The literature is replete with different terms for the activity of traveling abroad to provide medical 6 care on a volunteer basis, including \"short -term medical volunteerism\" [ 5], \"short -term medical trips\" experience\" \"international health 9 experience\"[ 2]. 10 11 The Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs prefers \"sh ort-term medical service trips.\" T his term is 12 clear, concrete, concise, and does not easily lend itself to multiple interpretations or 13 misunderstanding. I t also captures the features of these activities that are most salient from the 14 perspective of professional ethics in medicine: their limited duration and their orientation toward 15 service. 16 17 MEDICAL SERVICE IN RESOURCE- LIMITED SETTINGS 18 19 Traditionally, short -term medical service trips focused on providing clinical care as a charitable 20 activity, not infrequently under the auspices of faith- based institutions, whose primary goal was to 21 address unmet medical needs [ 10]. Increasingly, such trips focus on the broader goal of improving 22 the health and well -being of host communities [ 9]. Many also offer traini ng opportunities for 23 medical students and residents [9,10,11 ]. Ideally, short -term medical service trips are part of larger, 24 long- term efforts to build capacity in the health care systems being visited, and ultimately to reduce 25 global health disparities [9 ,10]. 26 27 The medical needs of host communities differ from those of volunteers' home countries \u2014 28 volunteers may encounter patients with medical conditions volunteers have not seen before, or who 29 present at more advanced stages of disease, or are complicated by \"conditions, such as severe 30 malnutrition, for which medical volunteers may have limited experience\" [ 7]. At the same time, 31 available treatment options will often include medications , procedures or tools with which 32 volunteers are not familiar. As such, g lobal health and limited -resource medicine should be 33 considered a unique area of expertise, requiring specific background and training to practice 34 effectively [12]. 35 36 By definition, short -term medical service trips take place in contexts of scarce resources. The 37 communities they serve are \"victims of social, economic, or environmental factors\" who have 38 limited access to health care [ 7], and often lack access to food, and economic and political power . 39 They \"may feel unable to say no to charity in any form offer ed\" [ 10]. Moreover, short -term 40 medical service trips take place under the long shadow of colonialism , including medicine's role 41 [10], and have been critiqued as perpetuating the colonial legacy of racism, exploitation, and 42 dependency [ 1,10, 13]. To avoid reproducing these injustices, participants and sponsors should 43 recognize t hat it is a privilege to practice and train in vulnerable communities, and that justice 44 requires reciprocity and equal respect among local and expatriate staff, community membe rs, and 45 patients in this context [9]. 46 47 These realities define fundamental ethical responsibilities not only for those who volunteer, but 48 equally for the individuals and organizations that sponsor short -term medical service trips . 49 CEJA Rep. 03- A-23 -- page 3 of 9 ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITIES IN SHORT -TERM MEDICAL SERVICE TRIPS 1 2 Emerging guidelines identify the following ethical duties for participants of short -term medical 3 service trips and organizations sponsoring them: (a) to produce good clinical outcomes, (b) to 4 promote justice and sustainability, (c) to minimize burdens on host communities, and (d) to respect 5 persons and local cultures [ 2,9,10,11 ]. 6 7 Promoting Justice & Sustainability 8 9 If short -term medical service trips are to achieve their goal of improving the health of local host 10 communities, they must commit not simply to addressing immediate, concrete needs, but to helping 11 the community build its own capacity to provide health care. To that end, the near and longer -term 12 goals of trips should be set in col laboration with the host community, not determined in advance 13 solely by the interests or intent of trip sponsors and participants [7,9]. Trips should seek to balance 14 community priorities with the training interests and abilities of participants [10], but i n the first 15 instance benefits should be those desired by the host community [9]. Likewise, interventions must 16 be acceptable to the community [9]. 17 18 Volunteers and sponsors involved with short -term medical service trips have a responsibility to ask 19 how they can best use a trip's limited time and material resources to promote the long -term goal of 20 developing local capacity. Will the trip train local health care providers? Build local infrastructure? 21 Empower the community [7]? Ideally, a short -term medical service trip will be embedded in a 22 longer -term strategy and collaboratively planned with the host community [7,10]. 23 24 Minimizing Harms & Burdens in Host Communities 25 26 Just as focusing on the overarching goal of promoting justice and sustainability is founda tional to 27 ethically sound short -term medical service trips, so too is identifying and minimizing the burdens 28 such trips place on the intended beneficiaries. 29 30 Beyond lodging, food, and other direct costs of short -term medical service trips, which are usual ly 31 reimbursed to host communities [9], such trips can place other, less visible burdens on local 32 communities. Physicians, trainees, and others who organize or participate in short -term medical 33 service trips should be alert to possible unintended consequences that can undermine the value of a 34 trip. Trips should not detract from or place significant burdens on local clinicians and resources, 35 particularly in ways that negatively affect patients, jeopardize sustainability, or disrupt 36 relationships between train ees and their home institutions [9,11]. For example, donations of 37 medical supplies can address immediate need, but at the same time create storage and distribution 38 burdens for the local health care system and jeopardize development by the local community o f 39 effective solutions to long- term supply problems [7]. Likewise, the expectation that local 40 healthcare and support staff will be available to assist visiting clinicians in addition to (or in place 41 of) their usual duties can disrupt care for their existing patients. It should not be assumed that host 42 communities can absorb additional cost s, even on a temporary basis [14]. Particular attention 43 should be paid to the follow -up care that burden s local pract itioners and may result in harm to 44 patients in the aftermath of invasive procedures [ 15]. 45 46 Negotiating beforehand how visiting health care professionals will be expected to interact with the 47 host community and the boundaries of the team's mission, skill, a nd training can reveal possible 48 impacts and allow them to be addressed before the team is in the field. Likewise, selecting team 49 members whose skills and experience map onto the needs and expectations of the host community 50 can help minimize disruptive effe cts on local practice [11]. Advance preparation should include 51 CEJA Rep. 03- A-23 -- page 4 of 9 developing a plan to monitor and address ongoing costs and benefits to patients and host 1 communities and institutions, including local trainees (when the trip includes providing training for 2 the host community), once the team is in the field [11]. 3 4 Respecting Persons & Cultures 5 6 Physicians and trainees who participate in short -term medical service trips face a host of 7 challenges. Some of them are practical, such as resource limitations, unfamiliar medical needs, 8 living conditions outside their experience, among many others. Others involve successfully 9 navigating language(s) and norms they may never have encountered before, or not encountered 10 with the same immediacy [1,2,9]. Striking a balance between Western medicine's understanding of 11 the professional commitment to respect for per sons and the expectations of host communities 12 rooted in other histories, traditions, and social structures calls for a level of discernment, 13 sensitivity, and humility that may more often be seen as the skill set of an ethnographer than a 14 clinician. 15 16 Indivi duals who travel abroad to provide medical care in resource -limited settings should be aware 17 that the interactions they will have in the field will inevitably be cross -cultural. They should seek to 18 become broadly knowledgeable about the communities in whic h they will work, such as the 19 primary language(s) in which encounters will occur; predominant local \"explanatory models\" of 20 health and illness; local expectations for how health care professionals behave toward patients and 21 toward one another; and salient economic, political, and social dynamics. Volunteers should take 22 advantage of resources that can help them cultivate the cultural sensitivity they will need to provide 23 safe, respectful, patient -centered care in the context of the specific host community [7 ,10,11]. 24 Further, trip partic ipants should be mindful that they bring with them their own unexamined 25 cultural beliefs and assumptions about lower income countries , some of which trace back to 26 colonialist, racialized attitudes . For instance, there is a widespread assumption that visiting 27 physicians and trainees possess universally applicable (and unmistakably superio r) skills and 28 knowledge by virtue of their association with W estern biomedicine [19]. 29 30 Individuals do not bear these responsibili ties alone . Org anizations and institutions that sponsor 31 short -term medical service trips have a responsibility to make appropriate orientation and training 32 available to volunteers before they depart [11], in addition to working with host communities to put 33 in place appro priate services, such as interpreters or local mentors, to support volunteers in the 34 field. 35 36 The ethical obligation to respect the individual patients they serve and their host communities' 37 cultural and social traditions does not obligate physicians and t rainees \"to violate fundamental 38 personal values, standards of medical care or ethical practice, or the law\" [9]. Volunteers will be 39 challenged, rather, to negotiate compromises that preserve in some reasonable measure the values 40 of both parties whenever po ssible [16]. Volunteers should be allowed to decline to participate in 41 activities that violate deeply held personal beliefs, but they should reflect carefully before reaching 42 such a decision [ 17]. 43 44 GETTING INTO THE FIELD 45 46 To fulfill these fundamental ethical responsibilities, requires meeting other obligations with respect 47 to organizing and carrying out short -term medical service trips. Specifically, sponsoring 48 organizations and institutions have an obligation to ensure thoughtful, diligent preparation to 49 promote a trip's overall goals, including appropriately preparing volunteers for the field 50 CEJA Rep. 03- A-23 -- page 5 of 9 experience. Physicians and trainees, for their part, have an obligation to choose thoughtfully those 1 programs with which they affiliate themselves [1,2, 9,11]. 2 3 Prepare Diligently 4 5 Guidelines from the American College of Physicians recognize that \"predeparture preparation is 6 itself an ethical obligation \" even though this is far from a universal practice [9,cf. 2,12]. 7 Collaborative planning can identify what material resources and clinical skills volunteers should be 8 expected to bring to the effort . For example, what activities volunteers should be assigned, or 9 whether local mentors are needed or desirable and how such relationships will be coordinated [ 11]. 10 11 Supervision of trainees also needs to be explicitly arranged and followed up once they reach the 12 field. Studies show that 20% of participants reported inadequate supervision during their trips, and 13 it is common for medical schools to allow \"students to arrange experiences abroad without faculty 14 supervision and support\" [ 18, 12]. Allowing students to practice in limited- resource settings 15 without proper supervision is a clear violation of their fiduciary duty. 16 17 Thoughtful preparation includes determining what nonclinical skills and experience volunteers 18 should have to contribute to the overall success of the service opportunity. For example, the goal of 19 supporting capacity building in the local community calls for participants who have \"training 20 and/or familiarity with principles of international development, social determinants of health, 21 ...public health systems\" and in some cases, health care administration [10 ,12]. Without this 22 background, interventions may resul t in \"resource wasting and potentially poorer patient care\" 23 [12]. 24 25 Adequately preparing physicians and trainees for short -term medical service trips encompasses 26 planning with respect to issues of personal safety, vaccinations, unique personal health needs, 27 travel, malpractice insurance, and local credentialing requirements [7]. Equally important, to 28 contribute effectively and minimize \"culture shock\" and distress, volunteers need a basic 29 understanding of the context in which they will be working [1,2,7]. Wi thout expecting them to 30 become experts in local culture, volunteers should have access to resources that will orient them to 31 the language(s), traditions, norms, and expectations of the host community, not simply to the 32 resource and clinical challenges they are likely to face. Volunteers should have sufficient 33 knowledge to conduct themselves appropriately in the field setting, whether that is in how they 34 dress, how they address or interact with different members of the community, or how they carry 35 out their clinical responsibilities [7]. They also need to know to whom they can turn for guidance . 36 If at all possible, this should be someone from outside the host community, since community 37 members may be reluctant to \"push back\" against the judgments and actions of volunteers [ 19]. 38 39 Preparation should also include explicit attention to the possibility that volunteers will encounter 40 ethical dilemmas. Working in unfamiliar cultural settings and with limited resources introduces the 41 real possibility that phys icians and trainees will encounter situations in which they \"are unable to 42 act in ways that are consistent with ethics and their professional values\" or \"feel complicit in a 43 moral wrong\" [9]. In particu lar, v olunteers will be required to assess \"how to balance risks and 44 benefits [ for very poor and medically vulnerable patients they would not normally encounter ] ... 45 how to distribute limited medical resources , and when non- intervention is the appropriate choice \" 46 [15]. In addition, volunteers may find that loca l biases are inconsistent with their own 47 commitments to equity and non- discrimination . Having strategies in place to address dilemmas 48 when they arise and to debrief after the fact can help mitigate the impact of such experiences. 49 Physicians under stress due to difficult ethical situations experience emotional harm and this ma y, 50 in turn, affect the quality of patient care [12]. In cases of irreducible conflict with local norms, 51 CEJA Rep. 03- A-23 -- page 6 of 9 volunteers may withdraw from care of an individual pat ient or from the mission after careful 1 consideration of the effect withdrawing will have on the patient, the medical team, and the mission 2 overall, in keeping with ethics guidance on the exercise of conscience. 3 4 Choose Thoughtfully 5 6 Individual physicians a nd trainees who volunteer for short -term medical service trips are not in a 7 position to directly influence how such programs are organized or carried out. They can, however, 8 choose to participate in activities carried out by organizations that fulfill the ethical responsibilities 9 discussed above [9,10,11]. Volunteers can select organizations and programs that demonstrate 10 commitment to long -term, community -led efforts to build and sustain local health care resources 11 over programs that provide episodic, stop- gap medical interventions, [10]. Volunteers should strive 12 to avoid working with \" volunteer placement organizations \" that operate primarily for their own 13 profit and/or lack adequate on- site supervision for trainees [14]. Such organizations exploit the 14 needs of host communities by offering the m a small sum per volunteer and then sending volunteers 15 to them without support. Physicians and trainees should also refrain from the \"casual or 16 opportunistic\" treatment of patients that are not coordinated with local health care systems in 17 advance [20]. 18 19 Measure & Share Meaningful Outcomes 20 21 Organizations that sponsor short -term medical service trips have a responsibility to monitor and 22 evaluate the effectiveness of their programs, [7 ,9,10]. The measures used to evaluate program 23 outcomes should be appropriate to the program's goals as defined proactively in collaboration with 24 the host community [9 ]. Prospective participants should affiliate themselves with programs that 25 demonstrate eff ectiveness in providing outcomes meaningful to the population they serve, rather 26 than simple measures of process such as number of procedures performed [7]. Since t he success of 27 procedures and programs cannot reasonably be verified if even their medium- term outcomes 28 cannot be monitored , participants should prefer programs that can track patient results over a n 29 extended timeframe, even if their own contribution is made in a short time. 30 31 RECOMMENDATION 32 33 In light of these considerations , the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs recommends that the 34 following be adopted and the remainder of this report be filed: 35 36 Short -term medical service trips, which send physicians and physicians in training from wealthier 37 countries to provide care in resource -limited settings for a period of days or weeks, have been 38 promoted as a strategy to provide needed care to individual patients and, increasingly, as a means 39 to address global health inequities. To the extent that such service trips also provide training and 40 educational opportunities, they may offer benefit both to the communities that host them and the 41 medical professionals and trainees who volunteer their time and clinical skills. 42 43 By definition, short -term medical service trips take place in contexts of scarce resour ces and in the 44 shadow of colonial histories. These realities define fundamental ethical responsibilities for 45 volunteers, sponsors, and hosts to jointly prioritize activities to meet mutually agreed- on goals; 46 navigate day- to-day collaboration across differences of culture, language, and history; and fairly 47 allocate host and team resources. Participants and sponsors must focus not only on enabling good 48 health outcomes for individual patients, but on promoting justice and sustainability, minimizing 49 burdens on host communities, and respecting persons and local cultures. Responsibly carrying out 50 CEJA Rep. 03- A-23 -- page 7 of 9 short -term medical service trips requires diligent preparation on the part of participants and 1 sponsors in collaboration with host communities. 2 3 Physicians and trainees w ho are involved with short -term medical service trips should ensure that 4 the trips with which they are associated: 5 6 (a) Focus prominently on promoting justice and sustainability by collaborating with the host 7 community to define mission parameters, includi ng identifying community needs, mission 8 goals, and how the volunteer medical team will integrate with local health care professionals 9 and the local health care system. In collaboration with the host community, short -term medical 10 service trips should priori tize efforts to support the community in building health care capacity. 11 Trips that also serve secondary goals, such as providing educational opportunities for trainees, 12 should prioritize benefits as defined by the host community over benefits to members of the 13 volunteer medical team or the sponsoring organization. 14 15 (b) Seek to proactively identify and minimize burdens the trip place s on the host community, 16 including not only direct, material costs of hosting volunteers, but also possible adverse effects 17 the presence of volunteers could have for beneficial local practices and practitioners. Sponsors 18 and participants should ensure that team members practice only within their skill sets and 19 experience. 20 21 (c) Seek to become broadly knowledgeable about the communities in which they will work and 22 take advantage of resources tha t help them to cultivate the cultural sensitivity they will need to 23 provide safe, respectful, patient -centered care in the context of the specific host community. 24 Members of the volunteer medical team are expected to uphold the ethics standards of their 25 profession and volunteers should insist that strategies are in place to address ethical dilemmas 26 as they arise. In cases of irreducible conflict with local norms, volunteers may withdraw from 27 care of an individual patient or from the mission after careful co nsideration of the effect that 28 will have on the patient, the medical team, and the mission overall, in keeping with ethics 29 guidance on the exercise of conscience. Volunteers should be clear that they may be ethically 30 required to decline requests for treatm ent that cannot be provided safely and effectively due to 31 resource constraints. 32 33 Sponsors of short -term medical service trips should: 34 35 (d) Ensure that resources needed to meet the defined goals of the trip will be in place, particularly 36 resources that cann ot be assured locally. This includes arranging for local mentors, translation 37 services, and volunteers' personal health needs. It should not be assumed that host 38 communities can absorb additional costs, even on a temporary basis . 39 40 (e) Proactively define a ppropriate roles and permissible range of practice for members of the 41 volunteer team , so that they can provide safe, high -quality care in the host setting . Team 42 members should practice only within the limits of their training and skills in keeping with 43 professional standards they would deem acceptable for practice in their home country, even i f 44 the host country's standards are more flexible or less rigorously enforced. 45 46 (f) Ensure appropriate supervision of trainees , consistent with their training in their home 47 countries , and make certain that they are only permitted to practice independently in ways 48 commensurate with their level of experience in resource- limited settings. 49 CEJA Rep. 03- A-23 -- page 8 of 9 (g) Ensure a mechanism for meaningful data collection is in place , consistent with recognized 1 standards for the conduct of health services research and quality improvement activities in the 2 sponsor's country. 3 4 (New HOD/CEJA Policy ) 5 Fiscal Note: Less than $500 CEJA Rep. 03-A-23 -- page 9 of 9 REFERENCES 1.

REPORT OF THE COUNCIL ON CONSTITUTION AND BYLAWS* CEJA Report 04-A-23 Subject: Responsibilities to Promote Equitable Care Presented by: Peter A. Schwartz, MD, Chair Referred to: Reference Committee on Amendments to Constitution and Bylaws The disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on minoritized and marginalized 1 communities harshly illuminated ongoing inequities in health care across the globe. In the U.S., the 2 pandemic lent new energy to calls for change within and outside medicine and health care. Even as 3 the American Medical Association ( AMA ) drew on the Code of Medical Ethics as a key resource 4 during this public health crisis, the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs recognized that 5 additional guidance is needed to explicitly address the ethical implications of social forces that 6 drive how and to whom health care is provided. What role, that is, should physicians and health 7 care institutions play as agents for change in the face of manifest inequ ity? 8 9 Looking critically at the Code, the council observed that existing guidance does indeed speak to 10 matters of fairness or justice in health care. Principle IX of the AMA Principles of Medical Ethics 11 enjoins physicians to \"support access to care for all people.\" Opinions variously enjoin physicians 12 to promote access to care and address financial barriers to care; to avoid discriminating against or 13 exploit ing patients and research participants; to be prudent stewards of health care resources in the 14 interests of all; to ensure that limited resources are allocated solely on the basis of medical criteria; 15 even to ensure that organs and tissues for transplantation are treated as a national rather than a 16 regional or local resource. (Appendix A.) 17 18 At the same time, the council recognized that, for the most part, guidance in the Code focuses 19 narrowly on the conduct of individual physicians in their interactions with individual patients. By 20 presenting guidance that addresses the manifestations of inequitable care, not the root causes, the 21 Code tacitly presumes that inequity flows strai ghtforward from the decisions and actions of 22 individuals. Yet medicine has long understood that social factors play a critical role in health status 23 and health disparities. 24 25 Such an individualist approach further fails to realize that the social drivers of health have deep and 26 powerful histories. While important and necessary, it is not sufficient to remind physicians of their 27 professional ethical obligations not to discriminate against patients based on explicit and 28 continuously evolving \"protected categor ies\" of civil rights law. A professional responsibility to 29 promote equitable care calls for situated, historically informed social and political knowledge of a 30 sort that physicians are not specifically trained in, however, and on forms of discernment and s elf- 31 reflection on which ethics guidance is generally silent. 32 *Reports of the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs are assigned to the Reference Committee on Amendments to Constitution and Bylaws. They may be adopted, not adopted, or referred. A report may not be amended, except to clarify the meaning of the report and only with the concurrence of the Council. CEJA Rep. 04-A-23 -- page 2 of 12 This report by the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs seeks to explore more thoughtfully the 1 joint responsibilities that physicians as individual professionals and health care institutions as sites 2 of service have to ensure that all patients in their practices and communities receive \"safe, 3 effective, patient centered, timely, efficient, and equitable care.\"[ Opini on 1.1.6 ] 4 5 FOUNDATIONAL ETHICS 6 7 At its core, the Code rests on an understanding of medicine as inherently a moral activity, rooted in 8 the encounter between \"someone who is ill, on the one hand, and someone who professes to heal, 9 on the other,\" in the words of physician and ethicist Edmund Pellegrino [1] . The \"covenant of 10 trust\" established in such encounters binds physicians in a duty of fidelity to patients. The Code 11 enjoins physicians, as medical professionals, to \"dedicate themselves to providing competent 12 medical care and respect for human dignity and rights.\"[Principle I ] Doing so encompasses a 13 responsibility for physicians to \"examine their own practices to ensure that inappropriate 14 considerations about race, gender identity, sexual orientation, sociodemographic factors, or other 15 noncli nical factors, do not affect their judgment.\"[ Opinion 8.5 ] Competent physicians \"cultivate 16 continuous self- awareness and self -observation,\" and strive to \"be attentive to environmental and 17 other factors that may compromise their ability to bring appropriate skills to the care of individual 18 patients and act in the patient's best interest.\"[ Opinion 8.13 ] 19 20 Together these commitments entail physicians' responsibility to become attentive to how their own 21 perceptions, attitudes, and assumptions can color how they interact with different patients and to 22 take steps to ensure that in delivering care their behavior as individuals neither privileges some 23 patients nor disadvantages others. 24 25 It is also the case that \"clinical medicine is t he final pathway through which public policies 26 ultimately come to affect the lives of sick persons\" [2] . Although Pellegrino had in mind the 27 specific example of managed care as the public policy in question, his observation holds more 28 broadly. Physicians' duty of fidelity also encompasses the responsibility to recognize and address 29 the ways in which the policies and practices of health care institutions shape patients' experience of 30 health, illness, and care. 31 32 SHIFTING PERSPECTIVE: FROM \"CULTURAL COMPETENCE\" TO \"STRUCTURAL 33 COMPETENCE\" 34 35 Training physicians for \"cultural competence\" has been promoted as a way to ensure that 36 physicians take account of non-medical dimensions of health and illness, with the ultimate goal of 37 promoting robust respect for patient autonomy and improving quality of care. By learning how to 38 recognize \"cross-cultural expressions of illness and health,\" the thinking has been, physicians 39 would \"be able to counteract the marginalization of patients by race, ethnicity, social class, 40 religion , sexual orientation or other markers of difference\" [3] . Yet as the physician anthropologist 41 Arthur Kleinman noted, \"culture\" is not reducible to a technical skill in which clinicians can 42 develop expertise [4]. Moreover, \"cultural factors are not always central to a case, and might 43 actually hinder a more practical understanding of an episode [of illness].\" 44 45 Patients' health status, outcomes, and experiences of care are shaped significantly by social, 46 economic, and political drivers unrelated to cultural understandings of illness and healing [3,5]. To 47 make meaningful progress in achieving equitable care, physicians must recognize how \"the 48 pathologies of social systems impact the material realities of their patients' lives\" [3]. As the 49 pathologist Rudolf Virc how noted more than a century ago, \"If medicine is to fulfill her great task, 50 CEJA Rep. 04- A-23 -- page 3 of 12 then she must enter the political and social life. Do we not always find the diseases of the populace 1 traceable to defects in society\" [5]? 2 Truly to address their patients' hea lth needs, physicians must acquire skills, not of cultural 3 competence, but of \"structural competence.\" That is: 4 5 the trained ability to discern how a host of issues defined clinically as symptoms, attitudes, 6 or diseases (e.g., depression, hypertension, obe sity, smoking, medication \"noncompliance,\" 7 trauma, psychosis) also represent downstream implications of a number of upstream 8 decisions, about matters such as health care and food delivery systems, zoning laws, urban 9 and rural infrastructures, medicalizatio n, or even about the very definitions of health and 10 illness [3,6] . 11 12 ADDRESSING INEQUITY, PROMOTING EQUITABLE CARE1 13 14 Public health exper t Camara Jones observed that when people think about \"racism\" they think of 15 \"personally mediated racism\": the expression of prejudice and discrimination based on \"differential 16 assumptions about the abilities, motives, and intentions of others\" and \"differen tial actions toward 17 others according to their race\" [7]. Personally mediated racism may be intentional or unintentional, 18 manifest in acts of commission and acts of omission. Jones distinguishes this from \"institutional 19 racism,\" that is, \"differential acces s to goods, services, and opportunities of society by race.\" 20 Institutionalized racism, she notes, is structural, \"codified in our institutions of custom, practice, 21 and law, so there need not be an identifiable perpetrator.\" 22 23 Fulfilling the ethical responsibility to promote equitable care, then, requires that medicine address 24 inequity and discrimination not only at the level of personal interactions among physicians and 25 patients, but equally at the institutional level in the policies and practices that struc ture interactions 26 within an institution's walls and in the institution's interactions with the community (communities) 27 beyond its walls. 28 29 Personal Interactions 30 31 Physicians individually cannot be expected to repair structural discrimination and inequity in health 32 care on their own, but they can hold themselves accountable for the ways in which their own 33 interactions with patients, families, and fellow health care p ersonnel may contribute to perpetuating 34 discrimination and inequity. Doing so requires that physicians cultivate awareness of how they 35 perceive others, how they speak about or describe persons and medical conditions, and how they 36 approach interactions with patients and others one on one. As first steps, they must address in their 37 own behaviors and implicit biases, such as the use of stigmatizing language and habits of 38 discrediting patients' knowledge and reports of illness. So too, adopting a trauma -informe d care 39 approach can help physicians recognize and address the medical and psychosocial effects for 40 patients of persistent marginalization and discrimination. 41 42 Implicit bias. In its 2003 report, Unequal Treatment, the Institute of Medicine linked health car e 43 professionals' implicit bias \u2014that is, bias, prejudices, and stereotypes that are not consciously held 44 or recognized\u2014to health disparities [8]. Subsequent research has confirmed that in health care, bias 45 is \"negatively associated with both care satisfacti on and provider trust among racial/ethnic minority 46 patients\" [9]. Among African American patients, for example, physicians' implicit bias has been 47 1 See Appendix B for selected resources for individuals and institutions . CEJA Rep. 04- A-23 -- page 4 of 12 shown to be a \"relatively consistent predictor of ethnic/racial differences in patients' subjective 1 experiences with their health care providers\" [10] . 2 3 Whether implicit bias is straightforwardly linked to discriminatory behavior is open to question 4 [10], but learning to recognize one's own biases offers a point of entry for cultivating the 5 awareness and critical self-reflection required of physicians as medical professionals. The most 6 effective training will affirm learners' egalitarian goals and commitment and go beyond raising 7 awareness to teach how to control implicit bias, using active learning techniques tha t enable 8 learners to practice new skills [10]. Training to \"replace negative nonverbal or paraverbal behaviors 9 with positive communication behaviors\" can be a practical, attainable way to improve health 10 outcomes [11] . 11 12 Stigmatizing language. How physicians and other health care personnel speak to and about patients 13 conveys multiple messages, intended and otherwise. Languages that \"others\" patients, \"blames\" 14 them for their illness, or casts them as dangerous or threatening can influence care in the moment 15 and risks perpetuating bias by inscribing it in the medical record [12,13] . Thus the U.S. National 16 Institute on Drug Abuse, for example, offers preferred language for talking about addiction [14] ; 17 Diabetes Australia likewise draws attention to problematic language used about diabetes [15]. 18 Phrasing that suggests negative attitudes toward patients, questions patients' credibility, conveys 19 disapproval of patients, or stereotypes them by race or social class captured in the medical record 20 can undermine care [13]. By the same token, complimenting patients, offering patient -centered 21 accounts of health behaviors that minimizes blame, and incorporating into the record details that 22 personalize the patient as an individual can foster less discriminatory, more effective interactions 23 [13]. 24 25 Language that calls into question patients' credibility or their ability to report their experience of 26 illness accurately or appropriately constitutes a form of epistemic injustice [16]. It demeans patients 27 as knowers based on physicia ns' expectations, explicit or implicit, about what information is 28 relevant and meaningful for the health care encounter. It privileges a biomedical model of disease 29 over patients' culturally and socially informed explanatory models and lived experience of illness 30 [4], at times in ways that may actually be harmful to patients when marginalizing their reports of 31 illness undermine diagnostic accuracy, isolate patients, or even lead them to withdraw from care 32 [17]. Epistemic injustice may be both more common and more likely to be harmful for patients 33 whose conditions are poorly understood or contested biomedically \u2014as has been the case with 34 chronic fatigue syndrome, for example [17]. By minimizing or outright dismissing the patient's 35 contribution to the encounter, physicians undermine trust and the opportunity to create an effective 36 therapeutic relationship. 37 38 Trauma- informed practice. Adopting a trauma -informed approach to care offers further 39 opportunity for physicians and other health care professionals to promote equitable care. Trauma - 40 informed care recognizes that trauma \"has lasting adverse effects on the individual's functioning 41 and mental, physical, social, emotional, or spiritua l well -being\" [18] . \"Trauma\" encompasses more 42 than the effects of a specific event \u2014sexual abuse, interpersonal violence, or exposure to combat, 43 for example [19] . It also acknowledges the impact of social, economic, and political structures that 44 cause harm to individuals and communities captured in Paul Farmer's concept of \"structural 45 violence\" [20] , which can carry forward through descendants of those who suffered [E.g., 21,22] . 46 47 Suggestions for implementing trauma -informed care focus on patient -centered co mmunication 48 practices, understanding the effects of trauma, interprofessional collaboration, understanding how 49 one's own experience of trauma may influence interactions with patients, and specific screening for 50 CEJA Rep. 04-A-23 -- page 5 of 12 trauma [19] . Trauma -informed practice acknowl edges that physicians cannot change a patient's 1 past; rather, it offers a way to help improve patients' function and well-being in the present [23] . 2 3 Institutional Policies and Practices 4 5 Health care institutions share in medicine's fundamental commitment of fidelity to patients. 6 Institutions are the physical and social settings of medical practice, constellations of resources and 7 relationships established to enable the provision of care. Indeed, health care only happens in and 8 through institutions. They re flect the attitudes of clinical professionals, administrators, and society 9 even as they help to form the attitudes of practitioners and shape the delivery of care. In 10 contemporary health care, institutions are the primary medium by which health care intera cts with 11 the political, economic, and social structures of society and the major means by which care is 12 delivered. They too bear the ethical responsibilities of medicine. 13 14 The policies and practices of health care institutions importantly determine what ca re choices are 15 available to patients and physicians. Regardless of size, physician practices, hospitals, and other 16 institutions share responsibility to promote equitable access and care for all. What an institution 17 chooses to know about its patients and staff and how that information factors into institutional 18 decision making and patterns of practice can play a significant role in whether or to what extent the 19 institution promotes equitable care across the board. 20 21 Social drivers of health. Just as how physicians perceive, speak about, and interact with others can 22 perpetuate discriminatory attitudes and inequity, so too can organizational decisions about what 23 information the institution captures about the patients it serves, how it does so, how that 24 information is available to clinicians for treatment purposes, and how (or whether) it informs 25 institutional operations. The foundational \"explanatory model\" of allopathic medicine\u2014to borrow 26 Kleinman's terminology again \u2014grounds diagnosis and treat ment jointly in biological function and 27 personal health behaviors, despite ample evidence that social factors powerfully influence health 28 and the delivery of health care [3,20,24]. 29 30 Recognition of the significant health impact of structural factors has led to calls to rethink the 31 social history to capture information beyond questions about tobacco or alcohol use to glean 32 information about the socioeconomic and political realities of patients' lives.[25]. For example, 33 initiatives at Brigham & Women's Health and Massachusetts General Hospital have expanded 34 history taking to gather information about patients' particular life circumstances, emotional health, 35 perceptions of health care, and health- related behaviors, as well as access to and utilization of 36 health care [26]. Other institutions have deployed tools to assess patients' \"structural 37 vulnerability,\" including whether someone has money to pay for rent, food, and utilities; a safe, 38 stable place to sleep; friends, family, or others who can provide help when needed; or has 39 experienced discrimination [27,28]. 40 41 Some health care institutions have gone beyond collecting data to intervene directly to address the 42 extra -medical factors that so deeply affect health through initiatives to promote income security, 43 medic al-legal partnerships to help patients address legal issues that impinge on health status, and 44 clinic -based child literacy programs among others [29,30]. 45 46 Race -based versus race -conscious tools. As CEJA noted in its 2021 informational report on 47 augmented intelligence in medicine, scholars have argued compellingly that medicine in the U.S. 48 helps to perpetuate racial discrimination and inequity \u2014and provide inadequate clinical care\u2014when 49 it grounds research and clinical practice in notions of race as unproblematically a genetic, 50 biological characteristic of patients rather than a socially mediated classification of persons [31,32]. 51 CEJA Rep. 04- A-23 -- page 6 of 12 A growing body o f evidence demonstrates that race -adjusted practices, intended to improve care, 1 are often in fact harmful [32], particularly as a result of biases built into clinical algorithms and 2 machine learning tools intended to support prediction of risk or diagnosis [33,34] . 3 4 Nonetheless, ignoring race and ethnicity entirely can also be damaging. As imperfect as the 5 category of race (/ethnicity) is, as a proxy measure it does indirectly capture important information 6 about the influence of sociocultural, economic, environmental and genetic factors on health and 7 health outcomes [31]. Scholars urge sc ientists and clinicians to continue to use categories of race 8 and ethnicity until better pre dictors become available [31]. Ensuring that when racial categories are 9 used, they promote equitable health remains of the upmost importance, however. 10 11 Aversive racism. How institutions interact with and treat their staff and affiliated personnel can also 12 perpetuate discrimination and inequitable care \u2014e.g., policies and practices for hiring and 13 promoting personnel can reflect aversive racism, \"which results from the interplay of ... social 14 dominance, implicit bias, and in- group favoritism\" [35]. Aversive raci sm is reflected in laments 15 about lack of qualified candidates from historically minoritized communities; it attributes an 16 individual's inability to thrive within an organization to their personal characteristics or behaviors; 17 and it buys into the \"myth of meritocracy\" that sees success as a function of ability while ignoring 18 the effects that structural inequity has on opportunity. To the extent that racial, ethnic, or gender 19 concordance between patient and physician improves patient satisfaction with care a nd health 20 outcomes, fostering and respecting diversity among health care personnel can be a path toward 21 promoting more equitable care . 22 23 Equity, safety, and quality improvement. As a species of \"wicked problem,\" a term first introduced 24 in the realm of urban planning [36] , inequitable care doesn't lend itself to a simple, one- time 25 solution. Wicked problems are dynamic, highly complex, and resistant to solution; generally there 26 is \"significant disagreement [among stakeholders] about the nature and cause of the problem and . . 27 . potential solutions\" [37] . By their nature, wicked problems cannot be solved by individual action 28 but must be addressed at the organizational or systems level. To address ongoing inequities in care, 29 institutions must first acknowledge th at such inequities exist \u2014they must ensure that they have 30 compendious information about patients and leverage that information to understand where and 31 how change needs to be made. For example, studies show that African American patients with 32 heart failure t end to have poorer outcomes than white patients \u2014but why that is the case isn't 33 apparent without further exploration. A retrospective study at Brigham & Women's Health found 34 that patients who receive care in a cardiology unit rather than on a medical ward have better 35 outcomes, and that African American and Latinx patients were less frequently admitted to 36 cardiology from the emergency department, as were women, suggesting an institutional pattern that 37 may contribute to disparate outcomes [38] . 38 39 Health care in stitutions in fact already have models on hand that can be adapted to promote 40 equitable care in the form, especially, of patient safety initiatives [39]. Like patient safety, equity 41 initiatives can focus on redesigning the processes and systems that perpet uate discrimination and 42 inequity. In both realms, well -designed initiatives: 43 44 balance [a] systems approach with individual accountability. Both recognize the role of 45 cognitive, often subconscious biases in contributing to unintentional harm. Both highlight 46 the importance of psychological safety to support difficult conversations. And both avoid 47 excessive focus on individual or interpersonal blame. The goal isn't to shame individual 48 clinicians but to build resilient systems around them that support optimal behaviors [39] . 49 CEJA Rep. 04- A-23 -- page 7 of 12 ADVOCATING FOR CHANGE 1 2 For both individual health care professionals and for health care institutions, the commitment to 3 serve patients in need entails obligations to examine prevailing attitudes, habits, policies, and 4 practices that determ ine what care is available to whom and to take steps to remove or re -engineer 5 obstacles that undermine the ability to ensure equitable care for all. 6 7 Physicians have a responsibility to recognize that despite ongoing change in health care and 8 seeming erosion of their authority they do have power within their institutions, and to use their 9 voice and status to advocate for change. They have a responsibility to help create opportunities in 10 which to raise challenging issues, to argue for tools to enable diffic ult conversations, and to 11 develop relationships within their institutions to support one another. Ultimately, physicians have a 12 responsibility to thoughtfully and constructively identify and begin to address the formal and 13 informal expectations that create barriers to equitable care for their patients and equitable treatment 14 of those who provide care and support caregiving within the health care institution. 15 Health care institutions have a responsibility to foster change within their walls, and to 16 acknowledge the multiple roles they play in their communities. Health care institutions are deeply 17 embedded in the life of their communities beyond their role in delivering care \u2014they are 18 employers, purchasers of goods and services, property owners, and civic leader ship. A growing 19 number of institutions recognize that as \"anchor institutions\" within their communities they can \u2014 20 and should \u2014be agents for positive change. As member institutions of the Healthcare Anchor 21 Network observe, 22 23 Hospitals and health systems are cr itical local economic engines and mission- driven 24 organizations inextricably linked to the long- term well- being of those we serve\u2014 because 25 of this, we as healthcare leaders, are uniquely positioned and incentivized to play a more 26 active role in supporting ou r local economies. We have an opportunity and obligation to 27 improve health and well -being outcomes in the communities we serve and confront 28 economic and social instability in our nation that remain obstacles to that goal [40] . 29 30 The Institute for Healthcare Improvement's Pursuing Equity Initiative identifies five strategies 31 institutions should adopt to eliminate racism \u2014and other forms of discrimination\u2014 in health care: 32 33 Understanding the context of racism and other forms of oppression among the 34 comm unities in which the institution is located ; 35 Normalizing discussion of oppression and listening to stakeholders to understand their 36 experience ; 37 Meaningfully promoting workforce diversity; 38 Developing and implementing business practices and policies through an equity lens ; 39 Adopting data systems that identify and track equity gaps in clinical outcomes ; 40 Using quality improvement strategies to narrow equity gaps and improve health care 41 for all [41]. 42 43 RECOMMENDATION 44 45 In light of these considerations, the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs recommends that the 46 following be adopted and the remainder of this report be filed: 47 48 Medicine at its core is a moral activity rooted in the encounter between a patient who is ill and 49 a physician who professes to heal. The \"covenant of trust\" established in that encounter binds 50 physicians in a duty of fidelity to patients. As witness to how public policies ultimately affect 51 CEJA Rep. 04- A-23 -- page 8 of 12 the lives of sick persons, physician s' duty of fidelity also encompasses a responsibility to 1 recognize and address how the policies and practices of the institutions within which 2 physicians work shape patients' experience of health, illness, and care. As the physical and 3 social settings of m edical practice, hospitals and other health care institutions share the duty of 4 fidelity and, with physicians, have a responsibility to ensure that the care patients receive is 5 safe, effective, patient centered, timely, efficient, and equitable. 6 7 Enduring health disparities across patient populations challenge these duties of fidelity. 8 Disparities reflect the habits and practices of individual clinicians and the policies and 9 decisions of individual health care institutions, as well as deeply embedded, hist orically rooted 10 socioeconomic and political dynamics. Neither individual physicians nor health care 11 institutions can entirely resolve the problems of discrimination and inequity that underlie health 12 disparities, but they can and must accept responsibility to be agents for change. 13 14 In their individual practice, physicians have an ethical responsibility to address barriers to 15 equitable care that arise in their interactions with patients and staff. They should: 16 17 a) Cultivate self -awareness and strategies for chan ge, for example, by taking advantage of 18 training and other resources to recognize and address implicit bias; 19 b) Recognize and avoid using language that stigmatizes or demeans patients in face -to- 20 face interactions and entries in the medical record; 21 c) Use the social history to capture information about non- medical factors that affect a 22 patient's health status and access to care to inform their relationships with patients and 23 the care they provide. 24 25 Within their institutions, as professionals with unique knowledge, skill, experience, and status, 26 physicians should collaborate with colleagues to promote change. They should: 27 28 d) Support one another in creating opportunities for critical reflection across the 29 institution; 30 e) Identify institutional policies and pract ices that perpetuate or create barriers to 31 equitable care; 32 f) Participate in designing and supporting well -considered strategies for change to ensure 33 equitable care for all. 34 35 As institutions in and through which health care occurs, hospitals and other health care 36 institutions share medicine's core values and commitment of fidelity, and with it ethical 37 responsibility to promote equitable care for all. Moreover, as entities that occupy positions of 38 power and privilege within their communities, health care instit utions are uniquely positioned 39 to be agents for change. They should: 40 41 g) Support efforts within the institution to identify and change institutional policies and 42 practices that may perpetuate or create barriers to equitable care; 43 h) Engage stakeholders to unders tand the histories of the communities they serve and 44 recognize local drivers of inequities in health and health care; 45 i) Identify opportunities and adopt strategies to leverage their status within the 46 community to minimize conditions of living that contribute to adverse health status. 47 48 (New HOD policy) 49 Fiscal Note: Less than $500 CEJA Rep. 04-A-23 -- page 9 of 12 REFERENCES 1.

Schwartz , MD, Chair Referred to: Reference Committee on Amendments to Constitution and Bylaws Policy G -600.110, \"Sunset Mechanism for AMA Policy,\" calls for the decennial review of 1 American Medical Association (AMA) policies to ensure that our AMA's policy database is 2 current, coherent, and relevant. This policy reads as follows, laying out the parameters for review 3 and specifying the needed procedures: 4 5 1. As the House of Delegates adopts policies, a maximum ten -year t ime horizon shall exist. A 6 policy will typically sunset after ten years unless action is taken by the House of Delegates 7 to retain it. Any action of our AMA House that reaffirms or amends an existing policy 8 position shall reset the sunset \"clock,\" making t he reaffirmed or amended policy viable for 9 another 10 years. 10 11 2. In the implementation and ongoing operation of our AMA policy sunset mechanism, the 12 following procedures shall be followed: (a) Each year, the Speakers shall provide a list of 13 policies that are subject to review under the policy sunset mechanism; (b) Such policies 14 shall be assigned to the appropriate AMA councils for review; (c) Each AMA council that 15 has been asked to review policies shall develop and submit a report to the House of 16 Delegates identifying policies that are scheduled to sunset; (d) For each policy under 17 review, the reviewing council can recommend one of the following actions: (i) retain the 18 policy; (ii) sunset the policy; (iii) retain part of the policy; or (iv) reconcile the po licy with 19 more recent and like policy; (e) For each recommendation that it makes to retain a policy in 20 any fashion, the reviewing council shall provide a succinct, but cogent justification (f) The 21 Speakers shall determine the best way for the House of Delegates to handle the sunset 22 reports. 23 24 3. Nothing in this policy shall prohibit a report to the HOD or resolution to sunset a policy 25 earlier than its 10 -year horizon if it is no longer relevant, has been superseded by a more 26 current policy, or has been accompli shed. 27 28 4. The AMA councils and the House of Delegates should conform to the following guidelines 29 for sunset: (a) when a policy is no longer relevant or necessary; (b) when a policy or 30 directive has been accomplished; or (c) when the policy or directive is par t of an 31 established AMA practice that is transparent to the House and codified elsewhere such as 32 the AMA Bylaws or the AMA House of Delegates Reference Manual: Procedures, Policies 33 and Practices. 34 Reports of the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs are assigned to the reference committee on Amendments to Constitution and Bylaws. They may be adopted, not adopted, or referred. A report may not be amended, except to clarify the meaning of the report and only with the concurrence of the Council. CEJA Rep. 05-A-23 -- page 2 of 5 5. The most recent policy shall be deemed to supersede contradi ctory past AMA policies. 1 2 6. Sunset policies will be retained in the AMA historical archives. 3 4 RECOMMENDATION 5 6 The Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs recommends that the House of Delegates policies that 7 are listed in the Appendix to this report be acted upon in the manner indicated and the remainder of 8 this report be filed.

Our AMA: (a) believes that the physician's nonjudgmental recognition of patients' sexual orientations, sexual behaviors, and gender identities enhances the ability to render optimal patient care in health as well as in illness. In the case of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, and other (LGBTQ) patients, thi s recognition is especially important to address the specific health care needs of people who are or may be LGBTQ; (b) is committed to taking a leadership role in: (i) educating physicians on the current state of research in and knowledge of LGBTQ Health and the need to elicit relevant gender and sexuality information from our patients; these efforts should start in medical school, but must also be a part of continuing medical education; (ii) educating physicians to recognize the physical and psychological needs of LGBTQ patients; (iii) encouraging the development of educational programs in LGBTQ Health; (iv) encouraging physicians to seek out local or national experts in the health care needs of LGBTQ people so that all physicians will achieve a better understanding of the medical needs of these populations; and (v) working with LGBTQ communities to offer physicians the opportunity to better understand the medical needs of LGBTQ patients; and (c) opposes, the use of \"reparative\" or \"conversion\" therapy for s exual orientation or gender identity. 2. Our AMA will collaborate with our partner organizations to educate physicians regarding: (i) the need for sexual and gender minority individuals to undergo regular cancer and sexually transmitted infection screenings based on anatomy due to their comparable or elevated risk for these conditions; and (ii) the need for comprehensive screening for sexually transmitted diseases in men who have sex with men; (iii) appropriate safe sex techniques to avoid the risk for sexually transmitted diseases; and (iv) that individuals who identify as a sexual and/or gender minority (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning individuals) experience intimate partner violence, and how sexual and gender minorities present wit h intimate partner violence differs from their cisgender, heterosexual peers and may have unique complicating factors. Resolution: 001 (A-23) Page 3 of 3 3. Our AMA will continue to work alongside our partner organizations, including GLMA, to increase physician competency on LGBTQ health is sues. 4. Our AMA will continue to explore opportunities to collaborate with other organizations, focusing on issues of mutual concern in order to provide the most comprehensive and up- to-date education and information to enable the provision of high qualit y and culturally competent care to LGBTQ people.

Our AMA acknowledges that, although the primary drivers of racial health inequity are systemic and structural racism, racism and unconscious bias within medical research and health care delivery have caused and continue to cause harm to marginalized communities and society as a whole. 2. Our AMA recognizes racism, in its systemic, cultural, interpersonal, and other forms, as a serious threat to public health, to the advancement of health equity, and a barrier to appropriate medical care. 3. Our AMA encourages the development, implementation, and evaluation of undergraduate, graduate, and continuing medical education programs and curricula that engender greater understanding of: (a) the causes, influences, and effects of systemic, cultural, institutional, and interpersonal racism; and (b) how to prevent and ameliorate the health effects of racism. 4. Our AMA: (a) supports the development of policy to combat racism and its effects; and (b) encourages governmental agencies and nongovernmental organizations to increase funding for research into the epidemiology of risks and damages related to racism and how to prevent or repair them. 5. Our AMA will work to prevent and combat the influences of racism and bias in innovative health technologies.

Our AMA recognizes that race is a social construct and is distinct from ethnicity, genetic ancestry, or biology. 2. Our AMA supports ending the practice of using race as a proxy for biology or genetics in medical education, research, and clinical practice. 3. Our AMA encourages undergraduate medical education, graduate medical education, and continuing medical education programs to recognize the harmful effects of presenting race as biology in medical education and th at they work to mitigate these effects through curriculum change that: (a) demonstrates how the category \"race\" can influence health outcomes; (b) that supports race as a social construct and not a biological determinant and (c) presents race within a soci o-ecological model of individual, community and society to explain how racism and systemic oppression result in racial health disparities. 4. Our AMA recommends that clinicians and researchers focus on genetics and biology, the experience of racism, and s ocial determinants of health, and not race, when describing risk factors for disease. Citation: Res. 11, I -20; Reducing Discrimination in the Practice of Medicine and Health Care Education D -350.984 Our AMA will pursue avenues to collaborate with the Amer ican Public Health Association's National Campaign Against Racism in those areas where AMA's current activities align with the campaign. Citation: BOT Action in response to referred for decision Res. 602, I -15; Health Plan Initiatives Addressing Social De terminants of Health H -165.822 Our AMA: 1. recognizing that social determinants of health encompass more than health care, encourages new and continued partnerships among all levels of government, the private sector, philanthropic organizations, and commu nity- and faith- based organizations to address non- medical, yet critical health needs and the underlying social determinants of health; 2. supports continued efforts by public and private health plans to address social determinants of health in health ins urance benefit designs; 3. encourages public and private health plans to examine implicit bias and the role of racism and social determinants of health, including through such mechanisms as professional development and other training; 4. supports mechani sms, including the establishment of incentives, to improve the acquisition of data related to social determinants of health, while minimizing burdens on patients and physicians; 5. supports research to determine how best to integrate and finance non- medica l services as part of health insurance benefit design, and the impact of covering non- medical benefits on health care and societal costs; and 6. encourages coverage pilots to test the impacts of addressing certain non- medical, yet critical health Resolution: 002 (A-23) Page 4 of 4 needs, f or which sufficient data and evidence are not available, on health outcomes and health care costs.

Our AMA recognizes that the false conflation of race with inherent biological or genetic traits leads to inadequate examination of true underlying disease risk factors, which exacerbates existing health inequities. 2. Our AMA encourages characterizing race as a social construct, rather than an inherent biological trait, and recognizes that when race is described as a risk factor, it is more likely to be a proxy for influences including structural racism than a proxy for genetics. 3. Our AMA will collaborate with the AAMC, AACOM, NBME, NBOME, ACGME and other appropriate stakeholders, including minority physician organizations and content experts, to identify and address aspects of medical education and board examinations which may perpetuate teachings, assessments, and practices th at reinforce institutional and structural racism. 4. Our AMA will collaborate with appropriate stakeholders and content experts to develop recommendations on how to interpret or improve clinical algorithms that currently include race- based correction fact ors. 5. Our AMA will support research that promotes antiracist strategies to mitigate algorithmic bias in medicine. Citation: Res. 10, I -20; AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 003 (A-23) Introduced by: Medical Student Section Subject: Laying the First Steps Towards a Transition to a Financial and Citizenship Need Blind Model for Organ Procurement and Transplantation Referred to: Reference Committee on Amendments to Constitution and Bylaws Whereas, The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) estimates there were 11.4 million 1 undocumented immigrants in the United States as of 2018, 5,500 - 8,857 of whom are living 2 with end- stage renal disease (ESRD) 1-3; and 3 4 Whereas, Patients with ESRD who are citizens or, in some cases, documented non -citizens are 5 eligible for coverage through Medicare, but undocumented non- citizens are not eligible for these 6 benefits4,5; and 7 8 Whereas, The cost of hemodialysis is exceptionally high, with a recent analysis suggesting a 9 cost of between $40,000 - $120,000 per year depending on the type of coverage6; and 10 11 Whereas, Undocumented immigrants who cannot afford the cost of maintenance hemodialysis 12 must rely on emergent -only hemodialysis after they develop life- threatening metabolic 13 disturbances, as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) mandates 14 that all states must provide federally funded emergency medical treatment irrespective of a 15 patient's ability to pay7; and 16 17 Whereas, California, New York, Illinois, Washington, and Colorado have passed laws that 18 recognize ESRD as an emergency medical condition, which allows Medicaid to be extended to 19 patients with ESRD for dialysis in outpatient clinics, but the remaining 45 US states do not have 20 similar exemptions8-12; and 21 22 Whereas, A cost -effective alternative approach to maintenance hemodialysis is kidney 23 transplantation13-15; and 24 25 Whereas, Current ethical and legal guidelines dictate that medical need alone should determine 26 how organs are allocated for transplant, including the AMA Code of Ethics 11.1.3, \"Allocating 27 Limited Health Care Resources\"; and 28 29 Whereas, Only 1% of all kidney transplant recipients per year are non- citizens, which is grossly 30 out of proportion to the 2 -3% annual contribution to the donor organ pool made by this same 31 population, suggesting that citizenship status is adversely impacting the ability of noncitizens to 32 receive needed organs16; and 33 34 Whereas, While organs may be allocated to undocumented immigrants, current policy excludes 35 this patient population from receiving federal funding (and often state and local funding as a 36 result) to cover their transplantation and post -transplantation care5,17- 19; and 37 Resolution: 003 (A-23) Page 2 of 7 Whereas, Undocumented persons are not only often unable to afford potentially curative kidney 1 transplants, they are also often unable to pay for costly post -transplant immunosuppressive 2 medications, which may lead to graft failure over time20; and 3 4 Whereas, Undocumented persons experience barriers to transplant eligibility for organs other 5 than the kidneys, with a recent study of liver transplants indicating that undocumented persons 6 rarely have access to liver transplantation and experience long wait times that can negatively 7 affect outcomes in the transplant recipients20-23; and 8 9 Whereas, Each transplant center sets their own rules for organ waiting list eligibility, which may 10 include financial status and insurance coverage alongside patient health and the presence of 11 risk factors, thus reducing the likelihood of accessing an organ transpl ant for undocumented 12 immigrants and legally present noncitizens who are uninsured24; and 13 14 Whereas, The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) is a private non- profit that contracts 15 with the federal government to oversee the Organ Procurement Transplant Network (OPTN), 16 which manages and maintains a national registry for organ matching in the US25-27; and 17 18 Whereas, Data from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) shows that from 2013- 2018, 19 heart and lung transplant outcomes were equivalent to or even better among non- citizens 20 compared to citizens at one year, showing that citizenship status does not adversely impact 21 transplant outcomes28; and 22 23 Whereas, The OPTN collects voluntary data on citizenship status for both organ donors and 24 recipients for two main purposes: first, to study the contribution of non -US citizens/non- US 25 residents to the organ transplantation network in the US, and second, to monitor transplant 26 centers to prevent medical transplant tourism, which is a widely condemned and often 27 exploitative practice wherein wealthy patients travel abroad to purchase or obtain organs from 28 poorer donors that can impinge on a host country's ability to provide for the transplant needs of 29 its own population29,30; and 30 31 Whereas, Current OPTN policy states that a candidate's citizenship or residency status should 32 not be considered when making decisions about organ allocation31; therefore be it 33 34 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association support initiatives that decrease financial 35 and institutional barriers for organ transplantation to uninsured or insurance- ineligible recipients, 36 regardless of immigration status, excluding medical tourism as defined in the AMA Code of 37 Ethics 1.2.13 (New HOD Policy) ; and be it further 38 39 RESOLVED, That our AMA Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs reconsider its Guidelines for 40 Organ Transplantation from Deceased Donors to consider the concerns of differential access 41 based upon immigration status (Directive to Take Action) ; and be it further 42 43 RESOLVED, That our AMA amend H- 370.982 by addition to read as follows: 44 45 Ethical Considerations in the Allocation of Organ and Other 46 Scarce Medical Resources Among Patients, H -370.982 47 Our AMA has adopted the following guidelines as policy: 48 (1) Decisions regarding the allocation of scarce medical resources among 49 patients should consider only ethically appropriate criteria relating to medical 50 need. (a) These criteria include likelihood of benefit, urgency of need, 51 change in quality of life, duration of benefit, and, in some cases, the am ount 52 Resolution: 003 (A-23) Page 3 of 7 of resources required for successful treatment. In general, only very 1 substantial differences among patients are ethically relevant; the greater the 2 disparities, the more justified the use of these criteria becomes. In making 3 quality of life judgments, patients should first be prioritized so that death or 4 extremely poor outcomes are avoided; then, patients should be prioritized 5 according to change in quality of life, but only when there are very 6 substantial differences among patients. (b) Research should be pursued to 7 increase knowledge of outcomes and thereby improve the accuracy of these 8 criteria. (c) Non -medical criteria, such as ability to pay, social worth, 9 immigration status, perceived obstacles to treatment or follow- up, patient 10 contribution to illness, or past use of resources should not be considered. 11 (2) Allocation decisions should respect the individuality of patients and the 12 particulars of individual cases as much as possible. (a) All candidates for 13 treatment must be fully considered according to ethically appropriate criteria 14 relating to medical need, as defined in Guideline 1. (b) When very 15 substantial differences do not exist among potential recipients of treatment 16 on the basis of these criteria, a \"first -come -first-served\" approach or some 17 other equal opportunity mechanism should be employed to make final 18 allocation decisions. (c) Though there are several ethically acceptable 19 strategies for implementing these criteria, no single strategy is ethically 20 mandated. Acceptable approaches include a three -tiered system, a minimal 21 threshold approach, and a weighted formula. 22 (3) Decision making mechanisms should be objective, flexible, and 23 consistent to ensure that all patients are treated equally. The nature of the 24 physician- patient relationship entails that physicians of patients competing 25 for a scarce resource must remain advocates for their patients, and 26 therefore should not make the actual allocation decisions. 27 (4) Patients must be informed by their physicians of allocation criteria and 28 procedures, as well as their chances of receiving access to scarce 29 resources. This information should be in addition to all the customary 30 information regarding the risks, benefits, and alternatives to any medical 31 procedure. Patients denied access to resources have the right to be 32 informed of the reasoning behind the decision. 33 (5) The allocation procedures of institutions controlling scarce resources 34 should be disclosed to the public as well as subject to regular peer review 35 from the medical profession. 36 (6) Physicians should continue to look for innovative ways to increase the 37 availability of and access to scarce medical resources so that, as much as 38 possible, beneficial treatments can be provided to all who need them. 39 (7) Physicians should accept their responsibility to promote awareness of 40 the importance of an increase in the organ donor pool using all available 41 means.

(c) Non- medical criteria, such as ability to pay, social worth, perceived obstacles to treatment, patient contribution to illness, or past use of resources should not be considered. (2) Allocation decisions should respect the individuality of patients and the particulars of individual cases as much as possible. (a) All candidates for treatment must be fully considered according to ethically appropriate criteria relating to medical need, as defined in Guideline 1. (b) When very substantial differences do not exist among potential recipients of treatment on the basis of these criteria, a \"first - come- first-served\" approach or some other equal opportunity mechanism should be employed to make final allocation decisions. (c) Though there are several ethically acceptable strategies for implementing these criteria, no single strategy is ethically mandated. Acceptable approaches include a three- tiered system, a minimal threshold approach, and a weighted formula. (3) Decisionmaking mechanisms should be objective, flexible, and consistent to ensure that all patients are treated equally. The nature of the physician- patient relationship entails that physicians of patients competing for a scarce resource must remain advocates for their patients, and therefore should not make the actual allocation decisions. (4) Patients must be informed by their physicians of allocation criteria and procedures, as well as thei r chances of receiving access to scarce resources. This information should be in addition to all the customary information regarding the risks, benefits, and alternatives to any medical procedure. Patients denied access to resources have the right to be informed of the reasoning behind the decision. (5) The allocation procedures of institutions controlling scarce resources should be disclosed to the public as well as subject to regular peer review from the medical profession. (6) Physicians should continue to look for innovative ways to increase the availability of and access to scarce medical resources so that, as much as possible, beneficial treatments can be provided to all who need them. (7) Physicians should accept their responsibility to promote awareness of the importance of an increase in the organ donor pool using all available means. Citation: CEJA Rep. K, A -93; Reaffirmed: CSA Reaffirmed: Appended: Reaffirmed: CEJA Rep. 4, A-22; E-6.2.1 Guidelines for Organ Transplantation from Deceased Donors Transplantation offers hope to patients with organ failure. As in all patient -physician relationships, the physician's primary concern must be the well -being of the patient. Howev er, organ transplantation is also unique in that it involves two patients, donor and recipient, both of whose interests must be protected. Concern for the patient should always take precedence over advancing scientific knowledge. Physicians who participate in transplantation of organs from deceased donors should: (a) Avoid actual or perceived conflicts of interest by ensuring that: (i) to the greatest extent possible that the health care professionals who provide care at the end of life are not directly involved in retrieving or transplanting organs from the deceased donor. Physicians should encourage health care institutions to distinguish the roles of health care professionals who solicit or coordinate organ transplantation from those who provide care at the time of death; (ii) no member of the transplant team has any role in the decision to withdraw treatment or the pronouncement of death. (b) Ensure that death is determined by a physician not associated with the transplant team and in accordance with accepted clinical and ethical standards. (c) Ensure that transplant procedures are undertaken only by physicians who have the requisite medical knowledge and expertise and are carried out in adequately equipped medical facilities. Resolution: 003 (A-23) Page 6 of 7 (d) Ensure that the prospective recipient (or the recipient's authorized surrogate if the individual lacks decision -making capacity) is fully informed about the procedure and has given voluntary consent in keeping with ethics guidance. (e) Except in situations of directed donation, ensure that organs for transplantation are allocated to recipients on the basis of ethically sound criteria, including but not limited to likelihood of benefit, urgency of need, change in quality of life, duration of benefit, and, in certain cases, amount of resources required for successful treatment. (f) Ensure that organs for transplantation are treated as a national, rather than a local or regional, resource. (g) Refrain from placing transplant candidates on the waiting lists of multiple local transplant centers, but rather place candidates on a single waiting list for each type of organ. Issued: 2016 E-1.2.13 Medical Tourism Medical tourists travel to address what they deem to be unmet personal medical needs, prompted by issues of cost, timely access to services, higher quality of care or perceived superior services, or to access services that are not available in their country of residence. In many instances, patients travel on their own initiative, with or without consulting their physician, and with or without utilizing the services of commercial medical tourism companies. The care medical tourists seek may be elective procedures, medically necessary standard care, or care that is unapproved or legally or ethically prohibited in their home system. Many medical tourists receive excellent care, but issues of safety and quality can loom large. Substandard surgical care, poor infection control, inadequate screening of blood products, and falsified or outdated medications in lower income settings of care can pose greater risks than patients would face at home. Medical tourists also face heightened travel -related risks. Patients who develop complications may need extensive follow -up care when they return home. They may pose public health risks to their home communities as well. Medical tourism can leave home country physicians in problematic positions: Faced with the reality that medical tourists often need follow -up when they return, even if only to monitor the course of an uneventful recovery; confronted with the fact that returning medical tourists often do not have records of the procedures they underwent and the medications they received, or contact information for the foreign health care professionals who provided services, asked to make right what went wrong when patients experience complications as a result of medical travel, often having not been informed about, let alone part of the patient's decision to seek health care abroad. (IV, V, VI) Physicians need to be aware of the implications of medical tourism for individual patients and the community. Collectively, through their specialty societies and other professional organizations, physicians should: (a) Support collection of and access to outcomes data from medical tourists to enhance informed decision making. (b) Advocate for education for health care professionals about medical tourism. (c) Advocate for appropriate oversight of medical tourism and companies that facilitate it to protect patient safety and promote high quality care. (d) Advocate against policies that would require patients to accept care abroad as a condition of access to needed services. Individually, physicians should: (e) Be alert to indications that a patient may be contemplating seeking care abroad and explore with t he patient the individual's concerns and wishes about care. (f) Seek to familiarize themselves with issues in medical tourism to enable them to support informed decision making when patients approach them about getting care abroad. (g) Help patients understand the special nature of risk and limited likelihood of benefit when they desire an unapproved therapy. Physicians should help patients frame realistic goals for care and encourage a plan of care based on scientifically recognized interventions. (h) Advise patients who inform them in advance of a decision to seek care abroad whether the physician is or is not willing to provide follow -up care for the procedure(s), and refer the patient to other options for care. (i) Offer their best professional guidance about a patient's decision to become a medical tourist, just as they would any other decision about care. This includes being candid when they deem a decision to Resolution: 003 (A-23) Page 7 of 7 obtain specific care abroad not to be in the patient's best interests. Physicians should encourage patients who seek unapproved therapy to enroll in an appropriate clinical trial. (j) Physicians should respond compassionately when a patient who has undergone treatment abroad without the physician's prior knowledge seeks nonemergent follow -up care. Those who are reluctant to provide such care should carefully consider: (i) the nature and duration of the patient -physician relationship; (ii) the likely impact on the individual patient's well- being; (iii) the burden declining to provide follow -up care may impose on fellow professionals; (iv) the likely impact on the health and resources of the community. Physicians who are unable or unwilling to provide care in these circumstances have a responsibility to refer the patient to appropriate services. Issued: 2018 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 004 (A-23) Introduced by: Medical Student Section Subject: Amending Policy H -525.988, \"Sex and Gender Differences in Medical Research\" Referred to: Reference Committee on Amendments to Constitution and Bylaws Whereas, Considering sex, which is assigned at birth, and gender, which is how an individual 1 identifies, are necessary to provide personalized care to patients 1,2; and 2 3 Whereas, The importance of understanding sex and gender differences in clinical medicine was 4 recognized and agreed upon by the 103rd Congress of the United States via the passage of the 5 National Institutes of Health (NIH) Revitalization Act of 1993, which mandated that NIH- funded 6 clinical trials include women and minoritized populations as participants, and evaluate outcomes 7 by sex and race or ethnicity3,4; and 8 9 Whereas, Recent studies have revealed that the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 has not resulted 10 in significant increases in reporting results by sex, race, or ethnicity4-6; and 11 12 Whereas, Published randomized controlled trials frequently lack adequate enrollment of women 13 and sexual and gender minority participants, and fail to stratify of outcomes by sex or gender6-8; 14 and 15 16 Whereas, In a study of 215 leading surgery journals, only 6.7% of editors were women9; and 17 18 Whereas, The lack of diversity in sex and gender among authors, editors, peer reviewers, and 19 others involved in the review process for articles increases the threat of implicit bias affecting 20 the editorial review process9; and 21 22 Whereas, A study evaluating whether the sex of research participants influenced the 23 recommendation to publish an article revealed that \"reviewers were almost twice as likely to 24 recommend publication for research conducted in men than the same research conducted in 25 women\"10; and 26 27 Whereas, Following the conduction of an internal audits of their peer- review process to self - 28 monitor whether a gender bias or other biases impeding inclusivity existed amongst their 29 journals, the American Geophysical Union encouraged other publishers and societies to 30 conduct similar audits to establish a baseline for measuring progress and to promote 31 accountability11; and 32 33 Whereas, Public access to medical research can promote collaboration between researchers 34 and help patients make informed decisions about their health12,13; and 35 36 Whereas, There is a lack of harmonized, sex -disaggregated and gender -disaggregated 37 statistics available to both the research community and the general public6,10; and 38 Resolution: 004 (A-23) Page 2 of 7 Whereas, Even when sex -disaggregated and gender -disaggregated data or clinical practice 1 guidelines are published, patients, physicians, community -based researchers, and research- 2 scientists will often remain unaware of their existence, as the resources fail to use sex -specific 3 and gender -specific terminology necessary to be cached by search engines7; and 4 5 Whereas, The United States federal government has demonstrated its capacity to support 6 efforts to provide centralized access to sex -stratified and gender -stratified data for patients, 7 physicians, and researchers via the establishment of digital repositories and publicly 8 downloadable databases by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney 9 Diseases (NIDDK), National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Hospital Ambulatory 10 Medical Care Survey, and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey15,16; and 11 12 Whereas, In a Listening Session with transgender adults organized by the Food and Drug 13 Administration (FDA), respondents unanimously expressed enthusiasm towards \"being part of 14 registry to collect information about surgical and medical treatment\"16,17; and 15 16 Whereas, These federal projects have developed and maintained confidentiality standards and 17 protocols that have protected patient privacy to date16,18; and 18 19 Whereas, Despite the passage of the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993, only 3 of the 22 medical 20 devices that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) deemed \"highest risk\" or \"novel\" from 21 2014 to 2017 provided subgroup analysis for both effectiveness and safety or both sensitivity 22 and selectivity for gender, race, and age19; and 23 24 Whereas, Clinical guidance criteria for implantable cardioverter defibrillators use, a device 25 subject to FDA approval, is based on clinical trials comprised of less than 30% females, and i n 26 which evidence of safety and effectiveness is much stronger in males20; and 27 28 Whereas, FDA studies that do not account for sex and gender may be ineffective or even 29 harmful to women, and sexual and gender minorities ' patients, as illustrated by an FDA study of 30 the LUTONIX drug coated balloon catheter device, in which there was an increased 31 effectiveness in the total population primarily attributed to male patients, while female patients 32 had significantly worse outcomes with 51% effectiveness in bladder control compared to 70% in 33 the control group19; and 34 35 Whereas, Women experience twice as many adverse drug reactions as men due to possible 36 overmedication, with one study showing 88% of evaluated FDA -approved drugs had altered 37 drug pharmacokinetic profiles lea ding to higher blood concentrations and elevated elimination 38 times in women than in men, and 96% of evaluated drugs with higher pharmacokinetic values in 39 women than men had a higher incidence of adverse drug reactions in women21; and 40 41 Whereas, Current medi cation labeling practices maintain a binary conception of gender, which 42 has impeded sexual and gender minority patients from obtaining necessary medication17; 43 therefore be it 44 45 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association facilitate t he inclusion of women and 46 sexual and gender minority participants in clinical research studies and reporting of how the sex 47 and gender of these participants influenced study outcomes requires the cooperation of 48 researchers, federal agencies, and journal editors, by amending Policy H -525.988, \"Sex and 49 Gender Differences in Medical Research, \" by addition and deletion to read as follows : 50 Resolution: 004 (A-23) Page 3 of 7 Sex and Gender Differences in Medical Research, H -525.988 1 Our AMA: (1) reaffirms that gender exclusion in broad medical studies 2 questions the validity of the studies' impact on the health care of society 3 at large; 4 (2) affirms the need to include both all genders in studies that involve the 5 health of society at large and publicize its policies; 6 (3) supports increased funding into areas of women's health and sexual 7 and gender minority health research ; 8 (4) supports increased research on women's health and sexual and 9 gender minority health and the participation of women and sexual and 10 gender minorities in clinical trials, the results of which will permit 11 development of evidence -based prevention and treatment strategies for 12 all women and sexual and gender minorities from diverse cultural and 13 ethnic groups, geographic locations, and socioeconomic status; and 14 (5) recommends that all medical/scientific journal editors require, where 15 appropriate, a sex -based and gender -based analysis of data, even if such 16 comparisons are negative.; 17 (6) recommends that medical and scientific journals diversify their review 18 processes to better represent women and sexual and gender minorities ; 19 and 20 (7) enc ourages the FDA to internally develop criteria for identifying 21 medication and medical devices seeking FDA approval that were 22 developed based on research that did not include adequate participation 23 of women, and sexual and gender minorities.

Citation: CSAPH Rep. 05, A -16; Comparative Effectiveness Research H -460.909 The following Principles for Creating a Centralized Comparative Effectiveness Research Entity are the official policy of our AMA: PRINCIPLES FOR CREATING A CENTRALIZED COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS RESEARCH ENTITY: A. Value. Value can be thought of as the best balance between benefits and costs, and better value as improved clinica l outcomes, quality, and/or patient satisfaction per dollar spent. Improving value in the US health care system will require both clinical and cost information. Quality comparative clinical effectiveness research (CER) will improve health care value by enhancing physician clinical judgment and fostering the delivery of patient -centered care. B. Independence. A federally sponsored CER entity should be an objective, independent authority that produces valid, scientifically rigorous research. C. Stable Funding. The entity should have secure and sufficient funding in order to maintain the necessary infrastructure and resources to produce quality CER. Funding source(s) must safeguard the independence of a federally sponsored CER entity. D. Rigorous Scientifically Sound Methodology. CER should be conducted using rigorous scientific methods to ensure that conclusions from such research are evidence- based and valid for the population studied. The primary responsibility for the conduct of CER and selection of CER meth odologies must rest with physicians and researchers. E. Transparent Process. The processes for setting research priorities, establishing accepted methodologies, selecting researchers or research organizations, and disseminating findings must be transparent and provide physicians and researchers a central and significant role. F. Significant Patient and Physician Oversight Role. The oversight body of the CER entity must provide patients, physicians (MD, DO), including clinical practice physicians, and indepe ndent scientific researchers with substantial representation and a central decision- making role(s). Both physicians and patients are uniquely motivated to provide/receive quality care while maximizing value. G. Conflicts of Interest Disclosed and Minimized. All conflicts of interest must be disclosed and safeguards developed to minimize actual, potential and perceived conflicts of interest to ensure that stakeholders with such conflicts of interest do not undermine the integrity and legitimacy of the resear ch findings and conclusions. Resolution: 004 (A-23) Page 5 of 7 H. Scope of Research. CER should include long term and short term assessments of diagnostic and treatment modalities for a given disease or condition in a defined population of patients. Diagnostic and treatment modalities should include drugs, biologics, imaging and laboratory tests, medical devices, health services, or combinations. It should not be limited to new treatments. In addition, the findings should be re- evaluated periodically, as needed, based on the development of new alternatives and the emergence of new safety or efficacy data. The priority areas of CER should be on high volume, high cost diagnosis, treatment, and health services for which there is significant variation in practice. Research priorities and method ology should factor in any systematic variations in disease prevalence or response across groups by race, ethnicity, gender, age, geography, and economic status. I. Dissemination of Research. The CER entity must work with health care professionals and heal th care professional organizations to effectively disseminate the results in a timely manner by significantly expanding dissemination capacity and intensifying efforts to communicate to physicians utilizing a variety of strategies and methods. All research findings must be readily and easily accessible to physicians as well as the public without limits imposed by the federally supported CER entity. The highest priority should be placed on targeting health care professionals and their organizations to ensure rapid dissemination to those who develop diagnostic and treatment plans. J. Coverage and Payment. The CER entity must not have a role in making or recommending coverage or payment decisions for payers. K. Patient Variation and Physician Discretion. Physic ian discretion in the treatment of individual patients remains central to the practice of medicine. CER evidence cannot adequately address the wide array of patients with their unique clinical characteristics, co- morbidities and certain genetic characteris tics. In addition, patient autonomy and choice may play a significant role in both CER findings and diagnostic/treatment planning in the clinical setting. As a result, sufficient information should be made available on the limitations and exceptions of CER studies so that physicians who are making individualized treatment plans will be able to differentiate patients to whom the study findings apply from those for whom the study is not representative.

Citation: Res. 610, A -19; Increasing Minority, Female, and other Underrepresented Group Participation in Clinical Research H-460.911 1. Our AMA advocates that: a. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct annual surveillance of clinical trials by gender, race, and ethnicity, including consideration of pediatric and elderly populations, to determine if proportionate representation of women and minorities is maintained in terms of enrollment and retention. This surveillance effort should be modeled after National Inst itute of Health guidelines on the inclusion of women and minority populations. b. The FDA have a page on its web site that details the prevalence of minorities and women in its clinical trials and its efforts to increase their enrollment and participation in this research; and c. Resources be provided to community level agencies that work with those minorities, females, and other underrepresented groups who are not proportionately represented in clinical trials to address issues of lack of access, distrus t, and lack of patient awareness of the benefits of trials in their health care. These minorities include Black Individuals/African Americans, Hispanics, Asians/Pacific Islanders/Native Hawaiians, and Native Americans. 2. Our AMA recommends the following activities to the FDA in order to ensure proportionate representation of minorities, females, and other underrepresented groups in clinical trials: a. Increased fiscal support for community outreach programs; e.g., culturally relevant community education, c ommunity leaders' support, and listening to community's needs; b. Increased outreach to all physicians to encourage recruitment of patients from underrepresented groups in clinical trials; c. Continued education for all physicians and physicians -in-trainin g on clinical trials, subject recruitment, subject safety, and possible expense reimbursements, and that this education encompass discussion of barriers that currently constrain appropriate recruitment of underrepresented groups and methods for increasing trial Resolution: 004 (A-23) Page 6 of 7 accessibility for patients; d. Support for the involvement of minority physicians in the development of partnerships between minority communities and research institutions; and e. Fiscal support for minority, female, and other underrepresented groups recruitment efforts and increasing trial accessibility. 3. Our AMA advocates that specific results of outcomes in all clinical trials, both pre- and post -FDA approval, are to be determined for all subgroups of gender, race and ethnicity, including consideration of pediatric and elderly populations; and that these results are included in publication and/or freely distributed, whether or not subgroup differences exist.

Physician leaders in medical schools and medical institutions should advocate for increased leadership in medicine among individuals of underrepresented genders and equitable compensation for all physicians. Collectively, physicians should actively advocate for and develop family -friendly policies that: (a) Promote fairness in the workplace, including providing for: (i) retraining or other programs that facilitate re- entry by physicians who take time away from their careers to have a family; (ii) on -site child care services for dependent children; (iii) job security for physicians who are temporarily not in practice due to pregnancy or family obligations. (b) Promote fairness in academic medical settings by: (i) ensuring that tenure decisions make allowance for family obligations by giving faculty members longer to achieve standards for promotion and tenure; (ii) establish more reasonable guidelines regarding the quantity and timing of published material needed for promotion or tenure that emphasize quality over quantity and encourage the pursuit of careers based on individual talent rather than tenure standards that undervalue teaching ability and overvalue research; (iii) fairly distribute teaching, clinical, research, administrative responsibilities, and access to tenure tracks; (iv) structuring the mentoring process through a fair and visible system. (c) Take steps to mitigate gender bias in research and publication. Issued: 2016 Resolution: 004 (A-23) Page 7 of 7 Alzheimer's Disease H -25.991 Our AMA: (1) encourages physicians to make appropriate use of guidelines for clinical decision making in the diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias; (2) encourages physicians to make available information about community resources to fac ilitate appropriate and timely referral to supportive caregiver services; (3) encourages studies to determine the comparative cost -effectiveness/cost -benefit of assisted in- home care versus nursing home care for patients with Alzheimer's disease and relate d disorders; (4) encourages studies to determine how best to provide stable funding for the long- term care of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementing disorders; (5) supports the use of evidence- based cost -effective technologies with prior consent of patients or designated healthcare power of attorney, as a solution to prevent, identify, and rescue missing patients with Alzheimer's disease and other related dementias with the help of appropriate allied specialty organizations; (6) supports incr eased awareness of the sex and gender differences in incidence and etiology of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias; and (7) encourages increased enrollment in clinical trials of appropriate patients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, and their families, to better identify sex -differences in incidence and progression and to advance a treatment and cure of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.

and 2 3 Whereas, Wearing modest or hijab- compl iant professional attire is religiously obligatory for 4 Muslim women observing hijab and a critical part of Muslim identity3; and 5 6 Whereas, Members of the medical care team or other patients who do not identify as Muslims 7 may also want to wear more modest clothing, due to spiritual, personal, or even medical 8 reasons; and 9 10 Whereas, Certain practicing Mormons, Amish, Orthodox Jews, and Christians use modest 11 apparel4; and 12 13 Whereas, A 2020 study found that 4.5% of the total US physician workforce consists of 14 physicians who are international medical graduates of Muslim -majo rity nations, and this number 15 does not include Muslim physicians born in the United States so the total number of US Muslim 16 physicians is likely higher5; and 17 18 Whereas, The Institute for Social Policy and Understanding's (ISPU) American Muslim Poll 19 2022: A Politics and Pandemic Status Report found that Muslims were the most likely religious 20 group to experience discrimination in institutional settings, especially when seeking healthcare 21 services6; and 22 23 Whereas, A national survey of American Muslim physicians in 2013 found that 24% of Muslims 24 surveyed experience religious discrimination on the job7; and 25 26 Whereas, There are many accounts of hijab- wearing Muslim women who state that their 27 medical duties are hindered due to a lack of modest attire, such as wearing an N -95 respirator 28 over a hijab8; and 29 30 Whereas, Modest or 'halal' scrub options and medical hijabs exist, but are not laundered by 31 hospitals or supplied by hospital -approved third parties, and therefore are not allowed into the 32 operating room per hospital pol icy8-10; and 33 34 Whereas, A 2018 study found wearing long sleeves while prepping a patient in the operating 35 room decreases airborne contaminants11; and 36 Resolution: 005 (A-23) Page 2 of 5 Whereas, The Association of Perioperative Registered Nurses (AORN) released guidelines in 1 2015 that require individuals who are scrubbed to wear long -sleeves in the operating room12; 2 and 3 4 Whereas, Despite concerns that long- sleeves can cause increased surgical site infections, a 5 study found that the implementation of AORN's guidelines about wearing long- sleeves in the 6 operating room did not affect the frequency of surgical site infections13; and 7 8 Whereas, A 2021 systematic review of 59 articles from 2000- 2019 found no correlation between 9 what was worn in the operating room and the incidence of surgical site infections14; and 10 11 Whereas, A 2021 systematic review found that research studying the association between 12 clothing in the operating room and surgical site infections is lacking, despite guidelines like 13 those of AORN's that stipulate operating room attire requirements14; and 14 15 Whereas, The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission states, \"...employers are 16 required by federal law to make exceptions to their usual rules or references to permit 17 employees to observe religious dress and grooming practices,\" and that hospitals with restrictive 18 policies could be liable for denial of accommodation without evidence that religious garb and 19 grooming pose a workplace risk or hazard15; and 20 21 Whereas, Modest, hospital -provided scrubs can serve as professional, clean and functional 22 attire8; and 23 24 Whereas, According to OSHA, personal protective equipment (PPE) is any equipment that is 25 worn by an individual whose purpose is to protect against exposures to hazardous materials 26 that can cause bodily harm in the workplace16; and 27 28 Whereas, According to OSHA, PPE should \"fit comfortably, encouraging worker use\" but hijab 29 observers often need to sacrifice comfort and ease of access for modesty9,16; and 30 31 Whereas, According to OSHA, scrubs are considered \"street clothing\", not PPE, and therefore 32 should be covered under gowns, aprons, and laboratory coats in the operating room17; and 33 34 Whereas, Before entering the operating room at most institutions, scrubs must be covered by an 35 additional sterile gown after a healthcare provider properly scrubs in, covering anything they 36 may be wearing below, including hospital laundered scrubs18; and 37 38 Whereas, The American Hospital Association promotes the enhancement of cultural 39 competency because cultural competency is recognized as an essential means of reducing 40 racial and ethnic disparities in health care19; and 41 42 Whereas, Cultural competence is defined as the ability of providers and organizations to 43 effectively deliver health care services that meet the social, cultural, and linguistic needs of 44 patients20,21; and 45 46 Whereas, Cultural competence in the healthcare setting includes incorporating culture -specific 47 attitudes and values into health promotion tools and willingness to make clinical settings more 48 accessible to patients20,21; and 49 Resolution: 005 (A-23) Page 3 of 5 Whereas, Lack of cultural competence may lead to patient dissatisfaction20,21; and 1 2 Whereas, Hospitals should provide modest scrubs for employees and hospital attire options for 3 patients as well to promote cultural and religious inclusivity2,6; and 4 5 Whereas, Some patients require modesty in interactions and in clothing during clinical 6 encounters and procedures2,22; and 7 8 Whereas, Failure to provide modest accommodations for patients who require it is a predictor of 9 delayed healthcare in certain patient populations23; and 10 11 Whereas, One approach of the AMA's 2021 -2023 Organizational Strategic Plan to Embed 12 Racial Justice and Advance Health Equity is to build alliances and share power with physicians 13 and stakeholders who have been historically marginalized & minoritized to \"develop structures 14 and processes to consistently center [their] experiences and ideas\"24; and 15 16 Whereas, Policy H -440.856 states that the AMA encourages all physicians to wear clean, 17 appropriate attire, and research into textile transmission of infections25; and 18 19 Whereas, Policy H -440.810 states that the AMA encourages diverse PPE designs to fit all 20 healthcare professional's body types, cultural expressions, and practices, but this policy fails to 21 consider the religious obligations of modesty that some may follow and the fact that scrubs are 22 not considered PPE according to OSHA26; and 23 24 Whereas, Policy H- 65.949 states that the AMA encourages healthcare institutions to provide 25 PPE that takes both patient safety and healthcare worker's natural hair/hairstyles or cultural 26 headwear into account, but does not explicitly state whether this applies to religious and cultural 27 modest clothing27; therefore be it 28 29 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association support the provision of safe, culturally 30 and religiously sensitive operating room scrubs and hospital attire options for both patients and 31 employees.

Our AMA affirms that the medical staff of each health care institution should be integrally involved in disaster planning, strategy and tactical management of ongoing crises. 2. Our AMA supports evidence- based standards and national guidelines for PPE use, reuse, and appropriate cleaning/decontamination during surge conditions. 3. Our AMA will advocate that it is the responsibility of health care facilities to provide sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) for all employees and staff, as well as trainees and contractors working in such facilities, in the event of a pandemic, natural disaster, or other surge in patient volume or PPE need. 4. Our AMA supports physicians and health care professionals and other workers in health care facilities in being permitted to use their professional judgement and augment institution- provided PPE with additional, appropriately decontaminated, personally -provided personal protective equipment (PPE) without penalty. Resolution: 005 (A-23) Page 5 of 5 5. Our AMA supports the rights of physicians and trainees to participate in public commentary addressing the adequacy of clinical resources and/or health and environmental safety conditions necessary to provide appropriate and safe care of patients and physicians during a pandemic or natural disaster. 6. Our AMA wil l work with the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response to gain an understanding of the PPE supply chain and ensure the adequacy of the Strategic National Stockpile for public health emergencies. 7. Our AMA encourages the divers ification of personal protective equipment design to better fit all body types, cultural expressions and practices among healthcare personnel.

Citation: BOT Rep. 3, A -10; Reaffirmation A -15 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 006 (A-23) Introduced by: American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law, American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry, American Psychiatric Association Subject: Ensuring Privacy as Large Retail Settings Enter Healthcare Referred to: Reference Committee on Amendments to Constitution and Bylaws Whereas, Large retail settings such as Amazon, CVS, Dollar General, Target, and Wal -Mart are 1 in the process of moving into the provision of general and mental healthcare; and 2 3 Whereas, Concerns have been raised by medical providers about the business models, role of 4 medical professionals, and quality of medical services provided by these organizations; and 5 6 Whereas, Amazon has not been transparent regarding if or how its medical databases would be 7 integrated with its other massive customer databases; and 8 9 Whereas, Amazon has not been transparent regarding how it will ensure the privacy of medical 10 data it accumulates through its healthcare businesses; therefore be it 11 12 RESOLVED, T hat our American Medical Association study privacy protections and the potential 13 for data breaches of healthcare records in large retail settings. (Directive to Take Action) 14 Fiscal Note: Modest - between $1,000 - $5,000 Received: 5/2 /23 RELEVANT AMA POLICY Patient Privacy and Confidentiality H -315.983 1. Our AMA affirms the following key principles that should be consistently implemented to evaluate any proposal regarding patient privacy and the confidentiality of medical information: (a) That there exists a basic right of patients to privacy of their medical information and records, and that this right should be explicitly acknowledged; (b) That patients' privacy should be honored unless waived by the patient in a meaningful way or in rare instances when strong countervailing interests in public health or safety justify invasions of patient privacy or breaches of confidentiality, and then only when such invasions or breaches are subject to stringent safeguards enforced by appropriate standards of accountability; (c) That patients' privacy should be honored in the context of gathering and disclosing information for clinical research and quality improvement activities, and that any necessary departures from the preferred practices of obtaining patients' informed consent and of de- identifying all data be strictly controlled; (d) That any information disclosed should be limited to that information, portion of the medical record, or abstract necessary to fulfill the immediate and specific purpose of disclosure; and (e) That the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) be the minimal standard for protecting clinician- patient privilege, regardless of where care is received. 2. Our AMA affirms: (a) that physicians and medical students who are patients are entitled to the same right to privacy and confidentiality of personal medical information and medical records as other patients, (b) that when patients exercise their right to keep their personal medical histories confidential, such action Resolution: 006 (A-23) Page 2 of 3 should not be regarded as fraudulent or inappropriate concealment, and (c) that physicians and medical students should not be required to report any aspects of their patients' medical history to governmental agencies or other entities, beyond that which would be required by law. 3. Employers and insurers should be barred from unconsented access to identifiable medical information lest knowledge of sensitive facts form the basis of adverse decisions against individuals. (a) Release forms that authorize access should be explicit about to whom access is being granted and for what purpose, and should be as narrowly tailored as possible. (b) Patients, physicians, and medical students should be educated about the consequences of signing overly -broad consent forms. (c) Employers and insurers should adopt explicit and public policies to assure the security and confidentiality of patients' medical information. (d) A patient's ability to join or a physician's participation in an insurance plan should not be contingent on signing a broad and indefinite consent for release and disclosure. 4. Whenever possible, medical records should be de- identified for purposes of use in connection with utilization review, panel credentialing, quality assurance, and peer review. 5. The fundamental values and duties that guide the safekeeping of medical information should remain constant in this era of computerization. Whether they are in computerized or paper form, it is critical that medical information be accurate, secure, and free from unauthorized access and improper use. 6. Our AMA recommends that the confidentiality of data collected by race and ethnicity as part of the medical record, be maintained. 7. Genetic information s hould be kept confidential and should not be disclosed to third parties without the explicit informed consent of the tested individual. 8. When breaches of confidentiality are compelled by concerns for public health and safety, those breaches must be as narrow in scope and content as possible, must contain the least identifiable and sensitive information possible, and must be disclosed to the fewest possible to achieve the necessary end. 9. Law enforcement agencies requesting private medical information should be given access to such information only through a court order. This court order for disclosure should be granted only if the law enforcement entity has shown, by clear and convincing evidence, that the information sought is necessary to a legitimate l aw enforcement inquiry; that the needs of the law enforcement authority cannot be satisfied by non- identifiable health information or by any other information; and that the law enforcement need for the information outweighs the privacy interest of the indi vidual to whom the information pertains. These records should be subject to stringent security measures. 10. Our AMA must guard against the imposition of unduly restrictive barriers to patient records that would impede or prevent access to data needed for medical or public health research or quality improvement and accreditation activities. Whenever possible, de- identified data should be used for these purposes. In those contexts where personal identification is essential for the collation of data, review of identifiable data should not take place without an institutional review board (IRB) approved justification for the retention of identifiers and the consent of the patient. In those cases where obtaining patient consent for disclosure is impracticable, our AMA endorses the oversight and accountability provided by an IRB. 11. Marketing and commercial uses of identifiable patients' medical information may violate principles of informed consent and patient confidentiality. Patients divulge information to thei r physicians only for purposes of diagnosis and treatment. If other uses are to be made of the information, patients must first give their uncoerced permission after being fully informed about the purpose of such disclosures 12. Our AMA, in collaboration w ith other professional organizations, patient advocacy groups and the public health community, should continue its advocacy for privacy and confidentiality regulations, including: (a) The establishment of rules allocating liability for disclosure of identi fiable patient medical information between physicians and the health plans of which they are a part, and securing appropriate physicians' control over the disposition of information from their patients' medical records. (b) The establishment of rules to pr event disclosure of identifiable patient medical information for commercial and marketing purposes; and (c) The establishment of penalties for negligent or deliberate breach of confidentiality or violation of patient privacy rights. 13. Our AMA will pursue an aggressive agenda to educate patients, the public, physicians and policymakers at all levels of government about concerns and complexities of patient privacy and confidentiality in the variety of contexts mentioned. 14. Disclosure of personally identif iable patient information to public health physicians and departments is appropriate for the purpose of addressing public health emergencies or to comply with laws regarding public health reporting for the purpose of disease surveillance. 15. In the event of the sale or discontinuation of a medical practice, patients should be notified whenever possible and asked for authorization to transfer the medical record to a new physician or care provider. Resolution: 006 (A-23) Page 3 of 3 Only de- identified and/or aggregate data should be used for \"business decisions,\" including sales, mergers, and similar business transactions when ownership or control of medical records changes hands. 16. The most appropriate jurisdiction for considering physician breaches of patient confidentiality is the relevant state medical practice act. Knowing and intentional breaches of patient confidentiality, particularly under false pretenses, for malicious harm, or for monetary gain, represents a violation of the professional practice of medicine. 17. Our AMA Board of T rustees will actively monitor and support legislation at the federal level that will afford patients protection against discrimination on the basis of genetic testing. 18. Our AMA supports privacy standards that would require pharmacies to obtain a prior w ritten and signed consent from patients to use their personal data for marketing purposes. 19. Our AMA supports privacy standards that require pharmacies and drug store chains to disclose the source of financial support for drug mailings or phone calls. 20. Our AMA supports privacy standards that would prohibit pharmacies from using prescription refill reminders or disease management programs as an opportunity for marketing purposes. 21. Our AMA will draft model state legislation requiring consent of all parties to the recording of a physician- patient conversation.

There are also guidelines set forth by many American 32 colleges and boards of medical specialties including the American College of Surgeons, 33 American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians, and the American College of Occupational 34 and Environmental Medicine. In addition to many nationally created guidelines, the examiner 35 may also consult the World Health Organizations Disability Assessment Schedules I and II, 36 which provide a simple and unified approach to the disabled patient. No uniform qualifications 37 Resolution: 007 (A-23) Page 2 of 2 training or certification have been established for physicians performing IME. Best practices 1 have been suggested by some experts in the field of IME6, 16; and 2 Whereas, There have been a long history of journalistic investigations including the New York 3 Times documenting the inherent problems of the IME process8, 9; and 4 5 Whereas, Worker and disabled patient advocacy groups have highlighted that injured and 6 disabled patients are discouraged from filing cl aims for fear of retaliation. The extent of fraud in 7 workers compensation is 1 - 2 %10, 17; and 8 9 Whereas, A substantial body of literature exists questioning the ethical foundation of 10 independent medical examinations (IMEs) in medicolegal cases. IME phys icians are prone to 11 biases, in that they are financially motivated to maintain a positive relationship with the 12 insurance carriers that hire them12, 13; and 13 14 Whereas, The following areas should be important considerations: a) qualifications for those 15 performing IME; b) appropriate privacy and informed consent for IME; c) fair and reasonable 16 policies and procedures including due process for including recording, advocacy and access to 17 the examination to their treating physicians for an IME; and d) model sta te or federal legislation, 18 rules, or regulations to protect the interest of those injured and disabled; therefore be it 19 20 RESOLVED , That our American Medical Association study and report back at the 2024 Annual 21 Meeting on the Independent Medical Evaluation (IME) process and recommend standards and 22 safeguards to protect injured and disabled patients.

Expansion of Medicare coverage to new services has been debated extensively by Congress . Proponents of expanding Medicare coverage for dental, vision, and hearing services have frequently suggested that Congress could change the law to add dental, vision, and hearing coverage under traditional Medicare Part B; beneficiaries could enroll in Medicare Advantage (Part C) plans; a new, optional part of Medicare for dental, vision, and hearing coverage that would be similar to Medicare Part D for prescription drug coverage co uld be created; or some form of cash assistance or debit card for beneficiaries who do not have access to coverage for dental, vision, and/or hearing services could be established. Nonetheless, while many believe that Medicare beneficiaries should have coverage for a wider range of services, significant obstacles remain. Given the current rate of inflation, the $358 billion projection from Congressional Budget Office in 2019 to include coverage for dental, vision, and hearing services in the Medicare prog ram over the next decade would likely be substantially higher today. Further, given that Medicare is subject to statutory budget neutrality requirements, the Council believes it is impossible to consider this issue in a vacuum , and we must be sensitive to what implications adding these services could mean for payment and access to other current health care services for Medicare beneficiaries. While t he Council acknowledges the potential value of expanded Medicare benefits, it believes that the current opti ons in place for beneficiaries to access these services are adequate. In terms of the current political environment, at the time that this report was written, Congress had failed to prevent a budget neutrality cut to the Medicare physician conversion facto r and was facing a stalemate on how to move forward with managing the national debt. Broader Medicare physician payment reform remains one of the highest priorities of the AMA , under the AMA's Recovery Plan for America's Physicians . The Council reemphasizes the importance of working with the American Dental Association regarding strategies to expand dental coverage to Medicare beneficiaries. The Council believes that the AMA can be most influential in addressing the need for hearing s ervices by improving mechanisms already in place. Additionally, the AMA can encourage the United States Preventive Task Services Task Force to re -evaluate its decision not to recommend screening for hearing loss in asymptomatic adults over age 65, especial ly considering the new evidence that exists about the connection of hearing loss and dementia. Finally, the Council believes that AMA policy on vision coverage can be strengthened , and we recommend amendments to P olicy H -25.990 to encourage programs and outreach efforts for affordable prescription eyeglasses .\u00a9 2023 American Medi cal Association. All rights r eserved . REPORT OF THE COUNCIL ON MEDICAL SERVICE CMS Report 02- A-23 Subject: Medicare Coverage of Dental, Vision, and Hearing Services (Referred Resolve Clause of Alternate Resolution 113 -A-22) Presented by: Lynn Jeffers , MD, MBA , Chair Referred to: Reference Committee A At the 2022 Annual Meeting, the House of Delegates partially referred Alternate Resolution 113, 1 which asked the American Medical Association ( AMA ) to \"support new funding that is 2 independent of the physician fee schedule for Medicare coverage of 1) preventive dental care, 3 including dental cleanings and x- rays, and restorative services, including fillings, extractions, and 4 dentures; 2) visual aids, including eyeglasses and contact lenses; and 3) aural rehabilitative services 5 and hearing aids. 6 7 Resolution 119 was combi ned with similar resolutions 113 and 114 to become Alternate Resolution 8 113, which was passed in part to become Policy D -185.972, \"Increasing Patient Access to Hearing, 9 Dental, and Vision Services.\" The policy states that the AMA will promote awareness of hearing 10 impairment as a potential contributor to cognitive impairment later in life and encourage further 11 research on this topic. This policy also encourages increased patient access to both vision and 12 dental services. 13 14 There was mixed testimony heard on these related items. There were several calls for referral, but 15 support for ensuring that patients have access to , and coverage for , essential hearing, dental, and 16 vision services . Some testimony noted that some of the r esolve clause s of the original resol utions 17 did not align with the United States Preventive Task Services Task Force (USPSTF) 18 recommendations for hearing and vision screening for older adults. Further testimony stressed that 19 the expansion of health insurance coverage, and potentially Medicare benefits, for dental, vision, 20 and hearing services needs to be considered not only from the patient perspective , but within the 21 context of a Medicare payment infrastructure that is unsustainable for physician practices. In 22 response to concerns regarding how coverage for these services would be paid for, an amendment 23 was proffered to ensure that our AMA supports new Medicare funding that is independent of the 24 Medicare P hysician Payment Schedule to pay for these services. However, the Reference 25 Committee noted in its report that expanding dental, vision, and hearing coverage would still 26 require \"pay -fors\" in the current Congressional environment, pitting these coverage expansions 27 against other AMA priorities that require funding. This referred clause was assigned by the Board 28 of Trustees to the Council on Medical Service for study . 29 30 The Council has developed reports on these topics in recent years. In 2015, the Council authored 31 CMS Report 6, \"Hearing Aid Coverage\" and concluded that a recommendation suppor ting adult 32 hearing aid coverage mandates would conflict with Policies H -185.964 and H -165.856, which 33 oppose new health benefit mandates unrelated to patient protections and which jeopardize coverage 34 to currently insured populations, and supports the princi ple that benefit mandates should be 35 minimized to allow markets to determine benefit packages and permit a wide choice of coverage 36 CMS Rep. 02- A-23 -- page 2 of 14 options. Given the policy, the Council did not recommend that the AMA support Medicare 1 coverage for hearing aids. 2 3 In 2019, t he Council authored CMS Report 3, \"Medicare Coverage for Dental Services\" and 4 concluded that the AMA should continue to explore opportunities to work with the American 5 Dental Association (ADA) to improve access to dental care for Medicare beneficiaries, su pport 6 initiatives to expand health services research on the effectiveness of expanded dental coverage in 7 improving health and preventing disease in the Medicare population, explore optimal dental benefit 8 plan designs to cost -effectively improve health and prevent disease in the Medicare population, and 9 examine the impact of expanded dental coverage on health care costs and utilization. 10 11 BACKGROUND 12 13 The most recent enrollment data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) show 14 that over 65 mil lion individuals are enrolled in Medicare. This includes 35 million individuals 15 enrolled in traditional fee -for-service Medicare plans and a little over 30 million individuals 16 enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans.1 According to a 2019 Kaiser Family Foundat ion (KFF) poll, 17 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries reported they could not get access to dental, vision, or hearing 18 care. These numbers were higher amongst those with low incomes, in poor health, and/or in 19 communities of color.2 20 21 Another 2019 KFF poll indicated that 90 percent of the American public s upported expanding 22 Medicare to include dental, hearing, and vision care a s a \"top\" or \"important\" priority for 23 Congress.3 However, recent attempts at passing legislation in Congress have not been successful. In 24 2019, the House passed H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act. Title VI of 25 this bill would have added new benefits for dental, vision, and hearing coverage under Medicare, 26 such as dentures, glasses, hearing aids, and preventive service s. The Congressional Budget Office 27 (CBO) estimate for this bill was $358 billion over the next ten years ($238 billion for dental 28 coverage, $30 billion for vision coverage, and $89 billion for hearing coverage).4 In 2021, H.R. 29 4311, the Medicare Dental, Vi sion, and Hearing Benefit Act was introduced in the House and 30 proposed repealing the statutory exclusion that restricts coverage of dental, vision, and hearing 31 benefits , and expanding coverage to offer these services under Medicare Part B. Neither of these 32 bills advanced out of Congress. In March 2023, Senators Bob Casey (D -PA) and Ben Cardin 33 (D-MD) introduced a similar bill, S.842, The Medicare and Medicaid Dental, Vision, and Hearing 34 Benefit Act. This bill would also repe al the statutory exclusion that restricts coverage of dental, 35 vision, and hearing services and expand coverage to offer: 36 Dental and oral care, including coverage of routine cleanings and exams, fillings and 37 crowns, major services such as root canals and extractions, emergency dental care and 38 other necessary services, and payment for both full and partial dentures. 39 Vision care, including routine eye exams , procedures performed to determine the 40 refractive states of the eyes and other necessary services, and payment for eyeglasses, 41 contact lenses, and low -vision devices. 42 Hearing care, including hearing exams, exams for hearing aids and other necessary 43 services, and payment for hearing aids. 44 This bill also encourages states to provide these optional services t o people with Medicaid by 45 increasing the associated Federal Medical Assistance Percentage rate to 90 percent. At the time that 46 this report was written , this bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Finance and the full text 47 of the bill was not yet avai lable. 48 CMS Rep. 02- A-23 -- page 3 of 14 DENTAL CARE AND COVERAGE 1 2 The medical -dental coverage divide first began in the 20th century. In the early 1900s , oral health 3 was widely thought to have little to no bearing on overall health and efforts to combine medical 4 and dental fields were opposed by dentists. In the 1920s, William Gies, a biological chemist, 5 insisted that oral health was directly related to overall health and recommended dentistry should be 6 integrated into the medical field, but dentists again resisted this change. During the 1940s and 7 1950s , the AMA and the ADA joined efforts to oppose health insurance nationalization and/or 8 expansion. During this same period, tap water fluoridation improved oral disease prevention among 9 Americans, which some believe d mitigated the need for s ome dental services and reduced demand 10 for dental insurance coverage. Moreover, because dental service coverage began being widely 11 included in employer -sponsored benefit packages later than medical health service coverage, it was 12 considered a \"perk\" or cos metic -only benefit, a perception that continues as dental care is still 13 regarded by many as auxiliary to general health care even though current research clearly 14 demonstrates the critical relationship between oral health and optimal overall health . When 15 Medicare legislation was passed in 1965, oral health coverage was not included. As a result, the 16 medical profession has frequently had to respond to the challenges of Medicare and Medicaid 17 coverage and changes in payment policy over the years, while d entistry has not.5 18 19 A statutory exclusion in Section 1862 (a)(12) of the Social Security Act expressly prohibits 20 coverage for most dental services, specifically, \"services in connection with the care, treatment, 21 filling, removal, or replacement of teeth or structures directly supporting teeth\" by Medicare for its 22 beneficiaries.6 Therefore, t raditional Medicare regulations do not include coverage for routine oral 23 health care including checkups, cleanings, and x- rays, or restorative procedures, tooth extracti on, 24 and dentures. To integrate dental benefits in Medicare, C ongress would need to remove this 25 exclusion, and add statutory changes, such as establishing the scope of dental services and a 26 mechanism for provider payment that is independent from the Medicar e Physician Payment 27 Schedule. 28 29 As of 2018, almost half of Medicare beneficiaries did not have a dental visit within the past year 30 (47 percent ), with higher rates among those who are Black (68 percent ) or Hispanic (63 percent ), 31 have low incomes (73 percent ), or who are in fair or poor health (63 percent ). Nonetheless, 94 32 percent of Medicare Advantage enrollees in individual plans are in a plan that offers access to some 33 dental coverage. Nearly two- thirds of Medicare Advantage enrollees (64 percent ) with access to 34 preventive benefits, such as oral exams, cleaning and/or x- rays, pay no cost sharing for these 35 services, though their coverage is typically limited to an annual dollar amount. Average 36 out-of-pocket spending on dental services among Medica re beneficiaries (both traditional 37 fee-for-service and Medicare Advantage) who had any dental service was $872 in 2019. Those 38 enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans paid slightly less out -of-pocket than those enrolled in 39 traditional Medicare ($729 vs. $995) .7 A February 202 3 study published in Health Affairs found 40 substantial declines in dental service use and worsened health outcomes after individuals became 41 eligible for traditional Medicare at age 65. Additionally, this study found that there was also 42 evidence of lower dental service use by those beneficiaries who opted for a Medicare Advantage 43 plan and who likely have some coverage for these services. The authors suggest that benefit and 44 plan design should not only offer coverage of these services, but als o address barriers to access to 45 necessary care beyond whether or not a beneficiary has coverage (i.e., out of pocket affordability 46 for co-pays/coinsurance, lack of familiarity with covered benefits , or inability to find local dentists 47 accepting Medicare or Medicare Advantage patients) .8 48 49 Historically, Medicare has paid for dental services when they are integral and inextricably linked to 50 treating a beneficiary's primary medical condition. However, the services Medicare paid for were 51 CMS Rep. 02-A-23 -- page 4 of 14 limited to those specified in sub -regulatory guidance, such as reconstruction of a ridge when 1 performed as a result of and at the same time as the surgical removal of a tumor; stabilization or 2 immobilization o f teeth when done in connection with the reduction of a jaw fracture; extraction of 3 teeth to prepare the jaw for radiation treatment of neoplastic disease; dental splints only when used 4 in conjunction with medically necessary treatment of a medical conditi on; and dental services - 5 including both examination and treatment - prior to organ transplants, cardiac valve replacement s, 6 and valvuloplasty.9 Beginning in 2023, CMS formally codified these existing services in 7 rulemaking and added additional services to the dental exclusion exception including dental 8 examination and treatment when performed prior to a cardiac valve replacement and valvuloplasty 9 or organ transplant procedures. In 2024, coverage will be expanded to include dental services to 10 eliminate infe ction prior to treatment for head and neck cancers. 11 12 Additionally, the new regulation establishes an annual process to review public input and clinical 13 evidence on other medical circumstances that may allow for payment of relevant dental services 14 under the same exception .10 Medical associations and their members are encouraged to participate 15 in this annual review process by submitting their comments. 16 17 ADA policy states that for the purpose of presenting potential legislation that includes dental 18 benefits for adults age 65 and over in a tax payer- funded public program such as, Medicaid, 19 Children's Health Insurance Program ( CHIP ), privately administered Medicare or other federal or 20 state programs, the ADA supports a program that: 1) covers individuals under 300 percent FPL; 21 2) covers the range of services necessary to achieve and maintain oral health; 3) is primarily funded 22 by the federal government and not fully dependent on state budgets; 4) is adequately funded to 23 support an annually reviewed reimbursement rate such that at least 50 percent of dentists within 24 each geographic area receive their full fee to support access to care; 5) includes minimal and 25 reasonable administration requirements; and 6) allows freedom of choice for patients to seek care 26 from any dentist while continuing to receive the full program benefit.11 The full text of the policy 27 can be found here: https://www.ada.org/about/governance/current-poli cies#medicare . 28 29 VISION CARE AND COVERAGE 30 31 Medicare Part B covers certain vision services including treatment for glaucoma, macular 32 degeneration, cataract surgery (if done using traditional surgical techniques or using lasers), annual 33 eye exams for diabetic retinopathy for patients with diabetes, and annual glaucoma tests for 34 patients at high risk for developing glaucoma. However, traditional Medicare does not typically 35 cover routine eye examinations or refractions for eyeglasses or contact lenses, nor does it cover 36 eyeglasses or contact lenses themsel ves, other than eyeglasses following cataract surgery or 37 corrective lenses if a patient has cataract surgery that implants an intraocular lens. 12,13 38 39 Beneficiaries typically spend significantly less on vision coverage compared to dental and hearing 40 services. Traditional Medicare does not generally cover routine eye exams. However , beneficiaries 41 can seek supplemental vision coverage from Medicare Advantage or other private ins urance 42 coverage. As of 2021, 99 percent of Medicare Advantage enrollees have access to some vision 43 coverage. 93 percent of Medicare Advantage enrollees are in plans that provide access to both eye 44 exams and eyewear (contacts and/or eyeglasses) . However, enrollees may be limited in terms of 45 frequency of obtaining certain covered services and may be subject to annual dollar limits. 14 46 47 Another option for seniors to receive an eye exam and eye health services is through EyeCare 48 America, which connects eligible seniors 65 and older with local volunteer ophthalmologists who 49 provide a medical eye exam often at no cost out -of-pocket, and up to one year of follow- up care for 50 any condition diagnosed during the initial exam and for the physician services. To qualify, an 51 CMS Rep. 02- A-23 -- page 5 of 14 individual must be a U.S. citizen or legal resident , age d 65 or older, not belong to a Health 1 Maintenance Organization or have eye care benefits through the Veterans Affairs , and not have 2 seen an ophthalmologist in three or more years. Notably, EyeCare America does not directly cover 3 the cost of eyeglasses, but can provide information to patients on where to get help paying for 4 eyeglasses if they are needed.15,16 5 6 HEARING CARE AND COVERAGE 7 8 When Medicare was enacted in 1965, it did not include any coverage for hearing aids. Hearing aids 9 were considered \"not routinely needed and low in cost\" and many Americans did not live long 10 enough to need them. Today, hearing loss a ffects one- third of adults over the age of 65 and has a 11 significant impact on health.17 Traditional Medicare does not cover hearing exams, hearing aids, or 12 aural rehabilitative services . Medicare Advantage charges additional premiums for hearing 13 coverage, with out -of-pocket costs and annual limits varying across plans. Traditional Medicare 14 covers medically reasonable and necessary hearing tests and treatments when ordered by a 15 physician or a non- physician practitioner including diagnostic services related to hearing loss that 16 is treated with surgically implanted hearing devices, and covers cochlear implants if a beneficiary 17 meets specific hearing loss criteria.18 Starting January 1, 2023 Medicare Part B expanded coverage 18 of audiology services to allow beneficiaries to receive care from an audiologist without a physician 19 or practitioner order once every 12 months for non- acute hearing assessments that are unrelated to 20 disequilibrium, hearing aids, or examinations for the purpose of prescribing, fitting, or changing 21 hearing aids .19,20,21 AMA policy supports coverage of hearing tests administered by a physician or a 22 physician- led team under Medicare's benefit (H -185.929). 23 24 In 2021, the USPSTF re viewed the need to screen asymptomatic adults over the age of 50 for 25 hearing loss and concluded that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits 26 versus the harms of screening for hearing loss in older adults . The USPSTF also stat ed that 27 additional research was necessary.22 28 29 In 2022, the Biden A dministration issued an executive order for the Food and Drug Administration 30 (FDA) to allow over the counter (OTC) purc hase of hearing aids for those with mild to moderate 31 hearing loss. OTC purchase of hearing aids became available in October 2022 and provides an 32 immediate, low -cost option for adults with mild to moderate hearing loss. OTC hearing aids range 33 in price from $99 to $3400 per pair and are readily available at local pharmacies, l arge retailers, 34 and online . By increasing competition among OTC hearing aid companies, the FDA rule is 35 designed to create more options for those who experience hearing loss and who want to purchase 36 affordable hearing aids.23,24 37 38 MEDICARE PART B AND BUDGET NEUTRALITY 39 40 Medicare law requires that increases and decreases in payment rates by CMS must be budget 41 neutral - i.e., any changes resulting from regulatory changes made by CMS must have no impact 42 on total Medicare spending. Typically, this is done by lowering the Medicare \"conversion factor.\" 43 Increases in total Medicare spending are set by law. Unlike hospitals and nursing homes, Medicare 44 physician payments lack an automatic annual update. As a result, Medicare payments have failed to 45 keep pace with rising inflation. 46 47 The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (PAYGO) requires that all new legislation changing 48 taxes, fees, or mandatory expenditures , when assessed together, must not increase projected 49 deficits. If legislation is enacted that cuts taxes o r increases expenditures without fully offsetting 50 the cost, PAYGO applies a budget enforcement mechanism called sequestration. Sequestration is 51 CMS Rep. 02- A-23 -- page 6 of 14 the automatic reduction of certain types of spending in the federal budget, generally by a uniform 1 percentage.25,26 2 3 If Congress adjourns at the end of a session with net costs on the Office of Management and 4 Budget scorecard, the President is required to issue a sequestration order implementing across -the- 5 board cuts to a select group of federal mandatory programs in an amount sufficient to offset the net 6 costs. There are some exemptions from sequestration, such as Social Security, most unemployment 7 benefits, interest on the national debt, federal retirement, and low -income entitlements (i.e., 8 Medicaid, S upplemental N utrition A ssistance P rogram , and Supplemental Security Income). 9 However, t he major remaining mandatory programs are subject to sequestration - including 10 Medicare. If sequestration is ordered, each non- exempt mandatory program is reduced for one year 11 by the same percentage, with one notable exception: Medicare payments subject to sequestration 12 cannot be reduced by more than four percent . If sequestration would require a percent reduction 13 great er than four percent , other non- exempt mandatory programs must make up the difference . To 14 date, a sequester pursuant to PAYGO has not been applied, as Congress has either exempted 15 legislation from PAYGO requirements or otherwise deferred the application of such 16 requirements.27 17 18 POTENTIAL MEDICARE COVERAGE OPTIONS FOR DENTAL, VISION, AND HEARING 19 SERVICES 20 21 Expansion of Medicare coverage to new services has been considered and debated extensivel y. 22 While many believe that Medicare beneficiaries should have coverage for a wide r range of 23 services, there are significant challenges to expanded coverage. Proponents of expanding Medicare 24 coverage for dental, vision, and hearing services have suggested the following: 25 26 Congress could change the law to add dental, vision, and hearing coverage under 27 traditional Medic are Part B . The benefits of this option are that it would impact all 65 28 million Medicare beneficiaries and could lead to enhanced benefits that are integrated into 29 other Medicare -covered services. The challenges facing this option include determining 30 new c laims systems and payment schedules that are independent of the Medicare Physician 31 Payment Schedule. Perhaps the largest challenge to this approach is the price tag assigned 32 by CBO : $358 billion over the next ten years is an enormous sum, especially when t he 33 current level of inflation is added to this previous score . Another major challenge involves 34 budget neutrality requirements. If these services were covered under Medicare Part B, the 35 conversion factor would need to be significantly reduced to balance th e increased 36 spending, thereby reducing payment for other Medicare Part B services. Alternatively, if 37 the conversion factor were to remain the same and the new funding was independent of the 38 Medicare Physician Payment Schedule, the pool of money allotted for Medicare Part B 39 would still have to increase substantially , which is also untenable. Under either of these 40 scenarios, funding for this option would be diverted from another program and there is 41 potential risk for competing federal priorities for the AMA (i.e., the AMA's Recovery Plan 42 for America's Physicians) . 43 44 Beneficiaries could enroll in Medicare Advantage (Part C) plans. C overage for dental, 45 vision, and hearing services under Medicare Advantage is already an option for most 46 beneficiaries. These services are often offered through supplementary coverage under 47 Medicare Advantage plans. Most Medicare Advantage enrollees are in plans that offer 48 dental (96 percent ), vision (99 percent ), and hearing (98 percent ) coverage. Medicare 49 Advantage plans can vary, but most plans cover both preventive and extensive dental 50 services, access to eye exams and eyewear (contacts and/or glasses), and hearing exams 51 CMS Rep. 02- A-23 -- page 7 of 14 and hearing aids. Medigap plans may also cover dental, vision, and hearing services t o 1 supplement traditional Medicare coverage. 2 3 A new, optional part of Medicare for dental, vision, and hearing coverage that would be 4 similar to Medicare Part D for prescription drug coverage could be created . Beneficiaries 5 would have the option to sign up, likely for an additional premium. While this new part 6 would not be subject to the specific budget neutrality requirements of adding coverage for 7 these services under Medicare Part B, the challenge of how to pay for this coverage still 8 remains. This solution could also further complicate the Medicare system and is largely 9 redundant for Medicare Advantage beneficiaries since the vast majority of Medicare 10 Advantage (Part C) plans already offer coverage for dental , vision, and hearing services for 11 an additional premium. Again, there is a lso the risk that advocacy for this option would be 12 in competition with other AMA priorities. 13 14 A form of cas h assistance or debit card for beneficiaries who do not have access to 15 coverage for dental, vision, and/or hearing services could be established . While this option 16 could be less costly than the others presented, the re is still a funding challenge present . 17 Other outstanding questions include the amount of money offered to each beneficiary, the 18 impact on beneficiaries who already have some sort of supplemental coverage, and how 19 government officials would ensure this assistance was only being utilized for cover ed 20 services. More research would need to be completed before consideration of this option. 21 22 AMA POLICY 23 24 AMA P olicy D -160.925 affirms the importance of oral health care. Policy H -330.872 affirms that 25 the AMA supports continued opportunities to work with the ADA and other interested national 26 organizations to improve access to dental care for Medicare beneficiari es. The policy goes on to 27 affirm AMA support for initiatives to expand health services research on the effectiveness of 28 expanded dental coverage in i mproving health and preventing disease in the Medicare population, 29 the optimal dental benefit plan designs to cost -effectively improve health and prevent disease in the 30 Medicare population, and the impact of expanded dental coverage on health care costs and 31 utilization. 32 33 Policy H -25.990 states that the AMA encourages the development of programs and/or outreach 34 efforts to support periodic eye examinations for elderly patients. 35 36 Policy H -185.929 states that the AMA encourages private health plans to offer optional riders that 37 allow their members to add hearing benefits to existing policies to offset the cost of hearing aid 38 purchases, hearing- related exams and related services; supports coverage of hearing tests 39 administered by a physician or physician- led tea m as part of Medicare's benefit ; supports policies 40 that increase access to hearing aids and other technologies and services that alleviate hearing loss 41 and its consequences for the elderly; encourages increased transparency and access for hearing aid 42 techn ologies through itemization of audiologic service costs for hearing aids; and supports the 43 availability of over the counter hearing aids for the treatment of mild- to-moderate hearing loss. 44 45 Policy D -185.972, established with the adoption of Alternate Resolution 113- A-22, affirms that the 46 AMA will promote awareness of hearing impairment as a potential contributor to the development 47 of cognitive impairment or dementia later in life and encourage other stakeholders to promote the 48 conduct and acceleration of r esearch into specific patterns of hearing loss to determine those most 49 linked to cognitive impairment or dementia and amenable to correction. The AMA will work with 50 interested national medical specialty societies and state medical associations to encourage and 51 CMS Rep. 02- A-23 -- page 8 of 14 promote research into hearing loss as a contributor to cognitive impairment, and to increase patient 1 access to hearing loss identification and remediation services; and promote research into vision and 2 dental health and to increase patient access to v ision and dental services. 3 4 More broadly, Policy H -185.964 states that the AMA opposes new health benefit mandates 5 unrelated to patient protections, which jeopardize coverage to currently insured populations . 6 Additionally, Policy D -390.946 affirms that the AMA will work towards the elimination of budget 7 neutrality requirements within Medicare Part B ; will eliminate, replace, or supplement budget 8 neutrality in Merit -based Incentive Payment System with positive incentive payments ; and will 9 advocate strongly to the current administration and Congress that additional funds must be put into 10 the Medicare physician payment system to address increasing costs of physician practices, and that 11 continued budget neutrality is not an option. 12 13 Other relat ed policies include D -330.935 and H -425.988, which state that the AMA will 14 collaborate with relevant stakeholders to actively promote the value of the Welcome to Medicare 15 Visit, the Tobacco Cessation Benefit, and other Medicare- covered preventive services, as well as 16 work with the federal government and other stakeholders to support providing preventive service 17 coverage for seniors. 18 19 As part of its Recovery Plan for America's Physicians, the AMA has dedicated an entire strategic 20 pillar to reforming the Med icare physician payment system . In February 2023, the AMA led nearly 21 100 organizations in asking Congress to explore long- term solutions to the Medicare physician 22 payment problems . The AMA is encouraging the 118th Congress to \"work with us on long- term, 23 substantive payment reforms and urge congressional hearings as soon as possible to begin 24 exploring potential payment solutions to ensure America's seniors continue to receive access to the 25 high- quality care they deserve.\"28 26 27 DISCUSSION 28 29 There are several aspects to consider when exploring ways to expand coverage for dental, vision, 30 and hearing services to Medicare beneficiaries , including cost, access, the current political 31 environment, the relevance of these services to overall health, existing AMA efforts to improve 32 Medicare payment to physicians, and the scope of the AMA's influence. 33 34 Given the current rate of inflation, t he $358 billion projection from CBO in 2019 to include 35 coverage for dental, vision, and hearing services in the Med icare program over the next decade 36 would likely be substantially higher today. In an environment in which Medicare is subject to 37 statu tory budget neutrality requirements , the Council believes it is impossible to consider this issue 38 in a vacuum and the AMA must acknowledge the likely impact tha t adding these services w ould 39 mean for payment and access to current health care services for Medicare beneficiaries. At the time 40 that this report was written, the bill recently introduced by Senators Casey and Cardin d id not have 41 a CBO score nor was the full text of the bill available. 42 43 The Council acknowledges the potential value of expanded Medicare benefi ts. Nonetheless, dental, 44 vision, and hearing services already are frequently offered through supplementary coverage under 45 Medicare Advantage ( Part C) or Medigap plans . Veterans can receive coverage for these services 46 through Veterans Health Administration (V HA) plans (including free hearing aids) , and low - 47 income individuals can often receive coverage through Medicaid. Other beneficiaries have private 48 coverage offered through an employer or an individually purchased plan. 49 CMS Rep. 02-A-23 -- page 9 of 14 In terms of the current political environment, a t the time that this report was written , Congress had 1 recently failed to prevent a budget neutrality cut to the Medicare physician conversion factor and 2 was facing a stalemate on how to move forward with managing the national debt. At a time when 3 physicians are already fighting to keep practices open amid continued p ayment cuts due to lack of 4 an annual inflation- based update, frozen Medicare payment rates under the Medicare Access and 5 CHIP Reauthorization Act, and budget neutrality restrictions , pursuing broader Medicare coverage 6 expansions would be extremely challenging . Enacting Medicare physician payment reform remains 7 one of the AMA's highest priorities under our Recovery Plan for America's Physicians. 8 9 The Council also reemphasizes the importance of working with the ADA when it comes to 10 strategies to expan d dental coverage to Medicare beneficiaries. It is crucial for the ADA and the 11 AMA to work together to navigate the current policy landscape regarding infringements on the 12 Medicare Physician Payment Schedule. While the Council acknowledges that oral health care is a 13 critical par t of overall health care, we believe that our dental colleagues are best positioned to 14 assess the payment structures that work best for their needs. Notably, i n 2020, the ADA enacted 15 new policy to address dental coverage under Medica re. The AMA will continue to work closely 16 with the ADA to share data on oral health care's impact on overall health, as stated in AMA policy. 17 18 The Council believes that the AMA can be most influential in addressing the need for hearing 19 services through im proving mechanisms already in place. Physicians should educate and encourage 20 their patients on lower cost hearing aids that are now available over the counter for mild to 21 moderate hearing loss. Additionally, the AMA can encourage the USPSTF to re-evaluate its 22 decision not to recommend screening for hearing loss in asymptomatic adults over age 65, 23 especially considering the new evidence that exists about the connection of hearing loss and 24 dementia. Hearing loss caught and treated early could prevent the onset of dementia and improve 25 quality of life for the aging population. 26 27 Finally, the Council believes that AMA policy on vision coverage could be strengthened, and we 28 recommend amendments to Policy H -25.990 to encourage programs and outreach effo rts for 29 affordable prescription eyeglasses. 30 31 RECOMMENDATIONS 32 33 The Council on Medical Service recommends that the following recommendations be adopted in 34 lieu of the referred Resolve clause of Alternate Resolution 113-A-22, and the remainder of the 35 report be filed: 36 37 1. That o ur American Medical Association ( AMA) support physician and patient education 38 on the proper role of over the counter hearing aids, including the value of physician-led 39 assessment of hearing loss, and when they are appropriate for patients and when there are 40 possible cost- savings. ( New HOD Policy ) 41 42 2. That our AMA encourage the United States Preventive Services Task Force to re- evaluate 43 its determination not to recommend preventive hearing services and screening s in 44 asymptomatic adults over age 65 in consideration of new evidence connecting hearing loss 45 to dementia . (New HOD Policy) 46 47 3. That our AMA amend Policy H- 25.990 by addition to read as follows: 48 49 Our AMA (1) encourages the development of programs and/or outreach efforts to support 50 periodic eye examinations and access to affordable prescription eyeglasses for elderly 51 CMS Rep. 02- A-23 -- page 10 of 14 patients; and (2) encourages physicians to work with their state medi cal associations and 1 appropriate specialty societies to create statutes that uphold the interests of patients and 2 communities and that safeguard physicians from liability when reporting in good faith the 3 results of vision screenings. (Amend HOD Policy) 4 5 4. That our AMA reaffirm Policy D-160.925, which recognizes the importance of managing 6 oral health and the importance of dental care to optimal patient care and supports the 7 exploration of opportunities for collaboration with the American Dental Association 8 (ADA) on comprehensive strategy for improving oral health care and education for 9 clinicians .

(Res. 212, I -21; Reaffirmed: Res. 240, A -22) REPORT 03 OF THE COUNCIL ON MEDICAL SERVICE (A -23) Private Insurer Payment Integrity (Reference Committee A) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY At the 2022 Annual Meeting, the House of Delegates referred Resolution 110- A-22, which asked the American Medical Association to advocate for private insurers to require, at a minimum, to pay for diagnosis and treatment options that are covered by government payers such as Medicare and seek legislation or regulation to ensure that private insurers sha ll not be allowed to deny payment for treatment options as \"experimental and/or investigational\" when they are covered under government plans. Private insurers may each make their own medical coverage determinations, which can vary across their product lines. Private insurers sometimes are able to deny coverage by labelling a diagnostic or treatment \"investigational,\" \"experimental,\" or \"not medically necessary,\" which may be exacerbated by the burdensome appeals process required to request reconsideration of a denial or adverse determination. Of government payers, Medicare is typically considered the national benchmark, particularly since it is a federal defined benefit program, with decisions centralized within the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Medicare develops National Coverage Determinations (NCDs) that are applied for all Medicare beneficiaries meeting the coverage criteria. The NCD process is a transparent, nine -month, evidence -based process with opportunities for public comment and suppl emental technological assessment, which may include clinical studies. The supposition that private insurers' medical coverage determinations are more restrictive than Medicare's is not necessarily true and may be based on the perception that traditional Me dicare fee- for-service coverage is more robust due to its paucity of prior authorization requirements. While the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) establishes benefit mandates in the form of essential health benefits (EHB), private ACA mark etplace insurers have demonstrated hesitancy in fully embracing the ACA EHB benefit mandate , even as it continues to be challenged by decisions such as Braidwood Management Inc. et al. v. Becerra et al . While maintaining a commitment to minimizing benefit mandates is essential, there is clearly a need for transparency of coverage determinations, specifically regarding disparities across insurer product lines. The NCD process is very robust and might serve as a template for establishing a comprehensive, evidence -based process to allow for consistency in determinations of experimental/investigational status and transparency in coverage determinations f rom which insurers can develop benefit packages. Use of such a process would eliminate seemingly arbitrary decisions by private insurers to deem a diagnosis and treatment option as \"experimental/investigational\" in order not to have to pay for it.\u00a9 2023 American Medical Association.

REPORT OF THE COUNCIL ON MEDICAL SERVICE CMS Report 03-A-23 Subject: Private Insurer Payment Integrity (Resolution 110 -A-22) Presented by: Lynn Jeffers, MD, MBA, Chair Referred to: Reference Committee A At the June 2022 Annual Meeting, the House of Delegates referred Resolution 110, which was 1 sponsored by the New York Delegation. Resolution 110-A-22 asked the American Medical 2 Association ( AMA) to advocate for private insurers to require, at a minimum, to pay for diagnosis 3 and treatment optio ns that are covered by government payers such as Medicare and seek legislation 4 or regulation to ensure that private insurers shall not be allowed to deny payment for treatment 5 options as \" experimental and/or investigational \" when they are covered under government plans . 6 Testimony at the June 2022 Annual Meeting regarding the resolution was generally opposed, 7 highlighting the complex issues surrounding private insurer versus governmental coverage, 8 specifically regarding benefit mandates and the differential drivers utilized in making medical 9 coverage determinations. This report focuses on the need for transparency of medical coverage 10 determinations, studies how 'investigational' diagnosis and treatment options are determined, 11 highlights essential AMA policy, and presents new policy recommendations. 12 13 BACKGROUND 14 15 Coverage Determinations by Private Insurers 16 17 Private insurers are a fragmented group of commercial plans operating under a broad range of 18 federal regulations as well as insurance and coverage rules and regulations that vary by state. Some 19 private insurers operate nationally. W hile they may look to governmental precedent in certain 20 situations, they each make their own medical coverage determinations , which can vary across their 21 product lines . Access to private insurers' medical coverage decisions is limited, but not entirely 22 restricted. For example, on the UnitedHealthcare (UHC) web site, the UHC commercial policy on 23 coverage of \"Off-Label/Unproven Specialty Drug Treatment\" includes a Food & Drug 24 Administration ( FDA ) section, noting that it is \"to be used for informational purposes only...FDA 25 approval alo ne is not a basis for coverage.\" 26 27 Private insurers sometimes are able to deny coverage by labelling a diagnostic or treatment 28 \"investigational,\" \"experimental,\" or \"not medically necessary,\" which may be exacerbated by the 29 burdensome appeals process requir ed to request reconsideration of a denial or adverse 30 determination. Patients are typically not aware of their right to appeal or legal due process 31 protections. This health insurance illiteracy is compounded among patients with limited access to 32 technology and other resources, leading to the potential for substantial health inequities across 33 private plans. 34 CMS Rep. 03-A-23 -- page 2 of 8 Coverage Determinations by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 1 2 Of government payers, Medicare is typically considered the national benchmark, particularly since 3 it is a federal defined benefit program , with decisions centralized within the Centers for Medicare 4 & Medicaid Services (CMS). Title XVIII of the Social Secur ity Act established Medicare w ith 5 coverage that is limited to items and services that are: 6 7 reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury; and 8 within the scope of a Medicare defined benefit category. 9 10 National Coverage De terminations 11 12 The vast majority of Medicare coverage is determined on the local level by clinician contractors 13 (Medicare Administrative Contractors [ MACs ] making Local Coverage Determinations [ LCDs ]). 14 However, in some cases, Medicare develops National C overage Determinations (NCDs) that are 15 applied for all Medicare beneficiaries meeting the coverage criteria. 16 17 The NCD process is a nine -month, evidence-based process with opportunities for public comment 18 and supplemental technological assessment by the Medicare Evidence Development & Coverage 19 Advisory Committee (MEDCAC), which may include clinical studies. If the NCD determines 20 coverage of an item or service only in the context of clinical study, it falls under the Coverage with 21 Evidence Development (CED) p rogram. NCDs in the CED program use available evidence to fit 22 that item or service within that benefit category. As such, CMS can act as a coverage gatekeeper 23 via the NCD process. This mechanism has been used over the past few decades and include s 24 evidence- based guidelines for coverage. 25 26 Since it has been nearly eight years since the criteria for CED were last evaluated, MEDCAC is 27 currently re -examining the requirements for clinical studies submitted for CMS c overage under 28 CED, acknowledging that the update is needed since technologies have become more complex. 29 MEDCAC also has conveyed \"a commitment to greater transparency in decision -making, to 30 making certain that study methodologies are 'fit to purpose' as determined by the topic, questions 31 asked, health outcomes studied, and to making certain that the populations studied are 32 representative of the diversity in the Medicare beneficiary population.\"1 33 34 The NCD process has been amended on several occasions (e.g., The Medicare Prescription Drug, 35 Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003), with updates made to the process for opening, 36 deciding, or reconsidering NCDs under the Social Security Act. The 2013 update developed an 37 expedited administrative process utilizing specific criteria to remove certain NCDs older than ten 38 years, thereby enabling MACs to determine coverage under the Social Security Act for sunset 39 NCDs. For 2023, CMS has updated Medicare coverage policies for colorectal cancer screening in 40 order to al ign with recent United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and national 41 medical specialty society recommendations. 2 42 43 Transparency is a keystone to the process, as CMS issues an annual report listing the NCDs made 44 in the previous calendar year in the form of a report to Congress. Additionally, there is an NCD 45 dashboard, outlining the status of NCDs at each stage of the process (i.e., under review, reviewed 46 but not yet opened, opened and undergoing national coverage analysis, and finalized). CMS h ouses 47 all Medicare coverage determinations in the Medicare Coverage Database (MCD). The MCD 48 includes LCDs as well as NCDs, along with reports on each. 49 CMS Rep. 03-A-23 -- page 3 of 8 The supposition that private insurers' medical coverage determinations are more restrictive than 1 Medicare's may be based on the perception that traditional Medicare fee- for-service coverage is 2 more robust due to its paucity of prior authorization requireme nts. Data indicates otherwise, such 3 as with NCDs for medical devices. F or each of the 47 medical devices considered for NCDs 4 between February 1999 and August 2013, it was found that NCDs were equivalent to the 5 corresponding private insurer policies roughly half of the time, more restrictive approximately a 6 quarter of the time, and less restrictive about a quarter of the time.3 7 8 Food and Drug Administration 9 10 The notion that Medicare \"adopts\" diagnostic and treatment options once approved by the FDA is 11 similarly problematic. Medicare does not automatically cover all FDA -approved devices and drugs. 12 Between 1999 and 2011, Medicare covered FDA-approved drugs or devices only 80 percent of the 13 time. 4 Additionally, Medicare has been found to have more stringent requirements than the FDA, 14 particularly for drugs or devices in patients with comorbidities. 15 16 The Medicare Benefit Policy Manual (Chapter 14 - Medical Devices) outlines that Medicare will 17 cover FDA-approved and Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved investigational devices 18 \"provided the investigational device meets certain requirements, including: (1) The device or 19 services associated with the use of a device are provided to the beneficiary within the start and end 20 dates contained in the master file; (2) There are no regulations, national coverage policies, or 21 manual instructions that would otherwise prohibit Medicare coverage.\" 22 23 Medicare Investigational Device Exemption 24 25 While Medicare normally does not cover experimental or investigational procedures, it does offer 26 an exemption for investigational devices to allow for coverage under some circumstances. The 27 Medicare Investigational Device Ex emption (IDE) was developed as part of the Medicare 28 Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) and includes two 29 categories: 30 31 Category A (Experimental): An innovative/experimental device for which \" absolute risk \" 32 of the device type has not been established (i.e., initial questions of safety and effectiveness 33 have not been resolved and the FD A is unsure whether the device type can be safe and 34 effective). There is no Medicare coverage for a Category A device but Medicare covers 35 routine care items and services in the trial . An example is the CG-100 Intraluminal ByPass 36 Device . 37 Category B (Non -experimental/non- investigational): A device for which the underlying 38 questions of safety and effectiveness of that device type have been resolved. Medicare 39 allows for coverage of the Category B device as well as for routine care items and services 40 in the trial. An example is the Viper Catheter System . 41 42 In 2015, CMS shifted responsibility for review and approval of IDE studies from the MACs to a 43 centralized CMS process, which includes a publicly accessible, updated list of Approved IDE 44 Studies. 45 46 Medicare Coverage of Innovative Technology and Definition of Reasonable and Necessary 47 48 In January 2021, CMS released a final rule on The Medicare Coverage of Innovative Technology 49 and Definition of \"Reasonable and Necessary,\" 5 which established pathways t o payment for 50 innovative technologies supported by high- quality, validated clinical data. The rule automatically 51 CMS Rep. 03- A-23 -- page 4 of 8 provided four years of coverage for all Medicare beneficiaries for newly approved medical devices, 1 in order to accelerate availability of medic al devices approved through the FDA breakthrough 2 pathway for innovative technologies. 3 4 As part of the rule, CMS proposed automatically transferring the coverage policy of commercial 5 insurance to Medicare beneficiaries for new products. In two identical com ment letters (November 6 2020 and April 2021), the AMA outlined several concerns with the proposal, namely the potential 7 loss of transparency in Medicare coverage decisions if tied to commercial health insurer policies 8 beholden to shareholder expectations. T he independent, public comment process utilized by CMS 9 to make coverage decisions appropriate for the Medicare population would be replaced with 10 coverage decisions based on objectives such as litigation avoidance or competitive advantage. The 11 AMA argued th at the focus should remain on what is most suitable and safest for Medicare 12 beneficiaries based on Medicare's determination. 13 14 After considering these and other comments, CMS rescinded the rule in November 2021, citing 15 concerns about lack of sufficient patient protections and lack of evidence of clinical benefit for the 16 newly approved medical devices in the Medicare population. At the present time, CMS is working 17 on a new proposed rule to create an accelerated Medicare coverage pathway, buildi ng on prior 18 initiatives such as CED.6 19 20 AFFORDABLE CARE ACT BENEFIT MANDATES 21 22 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires non -grandfathered health plans in 23 the individual and small group markets to cover the following essential health ben efits (EHB): (1) 24 ambulatory patient services; (2) emergency services; (3) hospitalization; (4) maternity and newborn 25 care; (5) mental health and substance use disorder services including behavioral health treatment; 26 (6) prescription drugs; (7) rehabilitati ve and habilitative services and devices; (8) laboratory 27 services; (9) preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management; and (10) pediatric 28 services, including oral and vision care. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) 29 regulatio ns define EHB using state -specific benchmarks. Since 2020, states have been granted 30 greater flexibility in establishing new standards for their EHB benchmark plans. Non -grandfathered 31 health plans cannot refuse coverage or limit benefits for pre -existing conditions. 32 33 Since the passage of the ACA in 2010, there have been more than 2,000 state and federal actions 34 attempting to limit, alter, or repeal it.7 Most recently, in Braidwood Management Inc. et al. v. 35 Becerra et al. , a federal judge ruled that insurers are no longer required to provide preventive 36 services recommended by USPSTF at no cost . While some states have challenged parts or all of the 37 ACA through legislation, others have acted to preserve the ACA by codifying certain provisions 38 into state law. 39 40 Private ACA marketplace insurers have demonstrated hesitancy in fully embracing the ACA EHB 41 benefit mandate , even as it continues to be challenged. For example, while insurers were initially 42 required to cover preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a medication tha t prevents the transmission of 43 human immunodefi ciency virus in high -risk populations (e.g., gay and bisexual men of color) 44 without cost sharing, not all insurers extended the benefit to the ancillary services (e.g., 45 venipuncture, office visits) required to provide PrEP. HHS had to issue subsequent guidance to 46 clarify that insurers were required to cover PrEP ancillary services under their EHBs. As decisions 47 such as Braidwood Management Inc. et al. v. Becerra et al., erode the ACA EHB benefit mandate, 48 it will become increasingly important that private ACA marketplace insurers are held accountable 49 for covering all current ACA EHB benefit mandates. 50 CMS Rep. 03-A-23 -- page 5 of 8 AMA POLICY 1 2 The AMA' s longstanding goals to allow markets to determine benefit packages in order to permit a 3 wide choice of coverage options and to refrain from jeopardizing coverage to currently insured 4 populations are reflected in numerous AMA policies as well as in the AMA Proposal for Reform , 5 which is grounded in AMA policies concerning pluralism, freedom of choice, freedom of practice, 6 and universal access for patients. AMA policy supports the minimization of benefit mandates to 7 allow markets to determine benefit packages, permitting a wide choice of coverage options. 8 9 Among the most relevant policies are those that: 10 11 Oppose new health benefit mandates unrelated to patient protections (Policy H-185.964); 12 Advocate for the minimization of benefit mandates (Policy H -165.856); 13 Support maximization of patient choice (Policy H -165.839) and free market choice of 14 plans (Policy H-330.912); 15 Encourage payers to utilize transparent and accountable processes for developing and 16 implementing coverage decisions and policies (Policy D-185.986); 17 Assure reasonable payment levels for mandated benefits in health insurance policies 18 (Policy D-385.966); and 19 Call for the AMA to develop model legislation and/or regulations to require that 20 commercial insurance companies, state Medicaid agencies, or other third party payers 21 utilize transparent and accountable processes for developing and implementing coverage 22 decisions and policies (Policy D-185.986). 23 24 While AMA policy opposes blanket benefit mandates, there is policy on coverage of specific 25 conditions and services . For example, Policy H -185.967 supports that treatment of pediatric 26 congenital or developmental deformities or disorders due to trauma or malignant disease should be 27 covered by all insurers, Policy H- 185.957 supports legislation that requires all third party payers 28 that cover surgical benefits to cover all strabismus surgery where medically indicated, and Policy 29 D-185.973 encourages insurance coverage of and payment for reconstructive services for the 30 treatment of physical injury su stained from intimate partner violence. The AMA defended Policy 31 D-185.979 by filing an amicus brief in Braidwood Management Inc. et al. v. Becerra et al., which 32 challenged support for first dollar coverage of preventive services. 33 34 The AMA definition of \"medical necessity\" (Policy H -320.953), urges payers to share third party 35 methodologies for determining medical necessity, and advocates for the opportunity for treating 36 physicians to provide medical evidence toward those determinations (Policy H -320.995). The 37 AMA's definition of medical necessity is included in state model legislation and has been enacted 38 in several states as a required definition, rather than allowing plans to develop their own 39 definitions. Policies H -320.968 and H-320.982 support that denial of medical necessity of services 40 or request for prior authorization be recommended by a physician of the same specialty as the 41 treating physician. 42 43 Finally, there is AMA policy to protect patients and physicians and encourage innovation in the 44 context of experimental or investigational treatments. Policy D- 460.967 calls for the AMA to study 45 the implementation of expanded access programs, accelerated approval mechanisms, and payment 46 reform models to increase access to investigational therapies. Policy H -460.965 states that the 47 AMA should pursue legislation and regulatory reform to mandate third party payer coverage of 48 patient care costs of nationally ap proved scientifically based research protocols. Policy H -480.996 49 supports that regulations be promulgated or interpreted so as to not interfere with the 50 CMS Rep. 03- A-23 -- page 6 of 8 patient/physician relationship or impose regulatory burdens that may discourage creativity and 1 innovati on in advancing device technology. 2 3 DISCUSSION 4 5 While maintaining a commitment to minimiz ing benefit mandates is essential , there is clearly a 6 need for transparency of coverage determinations, specifically regarding disparities across insurer 7 product line s. An insurer may cover something considered preventive under one product line yet 8 fail to cover the same thing under another product line. Such arbitrary coverage decisions not only 9 question payer integrity but also introduce superfluous physician adminis trative burdens , such as 10 prior authorization requirements . 11 12 While the AMA advocates for market -based solutions for coverage, there is presently a floor of 13 benefits nationally as ACA plans must cover certain conditions. ACA coverage decisions for non- 14 electi ve care at a basic leve l is necessary so that essential care is not determined by a patient's 15 socioeconomic status. While it would be helpful for private and governmental insurers to be 16 cognizant of each other's coverage decisions , it may not be ideal for them to be perfectly aligned 17 given that Medicare is sometimes more restrictive and sometimes less restrictive. However, to 18 encourage innovation, the process for gaining coverage must be transparent and expeditious . It 19 would be beneficial to continue to expand the ability of CMS to proactively engage coverage of 20 breakthrough therapies and devices at product launch - rather than having to wait for an NCD to be 21 established. When CMS requires additional studies prior to coverage , this feedback should ideally 22 be provided during the product development phase, not after the product is approved and available 23 to the public, when finding patients to enroll in trials is more difficult. 24 25 The NCD process is very robust and might serve as a template for establishing a comprehensive, 26 evidence -based process to allow for consistency in determinations of experimental/investigational 27 status and transparency in coverage determinations from which insurers can develop benefit 28 packages. The process could include online tools to allow physicians to easily check coverage 29 status rather than requiring completion of a prior authorization form and waiting for a response. 30 Implementation of such a process would not preclude private insurers from offering add itional or 31 alternative benefits that would distinguish their products in the marketplace, allowing for a wide 32 choice of coverage options in keeping with AMA policy. In following established precedents, i t 33 may amend t he base level for what is considered medical ly necessary care (e.g., USPSTF grade A 34 or B recommendations are covered without cost -sharing under the ACA). 35 36 Use of such a process would eliminate seemingly arbitrary decisions by private insurers to deem a 37 diagnosis and treatment option as \"experime ntal/investigational \" in order not to have to cover it. 38 There is considerable variation in how \" experimental/ investigational\" diagnosis and treatment 39 options are determined, which only escalates concern s regarding subjective and inequitable 40 decisions. While some in surers may define ex perimental/ investigational services as an intervention 41 that has not yet been determined to be medically effective for the condition being treated , others 42 describe it as something that has u ndergone basic laboratory testing and received approval from the 43 FDA to be tested in human subjects. The definition of experimental/investigational is a continuum 44 rather than a standard as it is contingent upon discrete, independent evaluations that vary from 45 insurer to insurer. While insurers may profess applying r easonable interpretation of their polic y 46 provisions, those are also variable and lacking a standard. 47 CMS Rep. 03-A-23 -- page 7 of 8 RECOMMENDATIONS 1 2 The Council on Medical Service recommends that the following be adopted in lieu of Resolution 3 110-A-22, and the remainder of the report be filed: 4 5 1.

Explaining Litigation Challenging the ACA's Preventive Services Requirements: Braidwood Management Inc. v. Becerra. KFF -inc-v-becerra/ REPORT 04 OF THE COUNCIL ON MEDICAL SERVICE (A- 23) Bundled Payments and Medically Necessary Care (Resolution 111- A-22) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY At the 2022 Annual Meeting, the House of Delegates referred Resolution 111, which asked the American Medical Association ( AMA ) to 1) advocate that coverage rules for Medicaid \"episodes of care\" be carefully reviewed to ensure that they do not incentivize l imiting medically necessary services for patients to allow better reimbursement for recipients of the bundled payment; 2) study the issue of bundled payments and medically necessary care with a report back to explore the unintended long- term consequences on health care expenditures, physician reimbursement, and patient outcomes; and 3) advocate that functional improvement be a key target outcome for bundled payments. The Council's review of the literature on select Medicare bundled payment models and Medicaid episodes of care found that lower extremity joint replacement (LEJR) bundles, and some perinatal episodes of care, have produced the most \u2014but still modest \u2014savings without compromising care quality. Because the evidence is clear that the savings accrued under LEJR episodes has been due to decreased spending on skilled nursing and inpatient rehabilitation facilities, some physicians have questioned whether patient access to medically necessary care, including institutional post - acute care , could potential ly be limited. The Council believes that performance metrics measuring key patient -centered outcomes, including functional improvements after orthopedic and other procedures, are important and necessary checks on the risk that some models may underserve patients. Because the AMA already has extensive policy on alternative payment models ( APMs ), we recommend amending Policies H -390.849[2, 3] and D -385.952[1, 2] to address this concern instead of crafting a separate policy statement specific to bundled/episode -based payments. To address other concerns and obstacles under bundled/episode -based payment models, the Council recommends reaffirmation of Policy H -385.907, which supports fair and accurate risk adjustment systems, and Policy H -385.913, which outlines goals to be pursued as part of physician - focused APMs \u2014including that models be designed by physicians or with significant input from physicians, provide flexibility to physicians to deliver the care patients need, provide adequate and predictable resource s, and avoid placing physician practices at substantial financial risk\u2014and directs the AMA to continue to work with national medical specialty societies and state medical associations to educate physicians on APMs. The Council believes that well- designed, patient - centered bundled payment models can improve care quality and patient outcomes in ways that also lower growth in health care spending. Designing these models to work effectively for patients, physicians, and payers remains challenging, and ongoing r efinements to models may be needed to ensure optimal patient outcomes as these initiatives continue to expand. \u00a9 2023 American Medical Association. All rights r eserved . REPORT OF THE COUNCIL ON MEDICAL SERVICE CMS Report 04- A-23 Subject: Bundled Payments and Medically Necessary Care (Resolution 111 -A-22) Presented by: Lynn Jeffers, MD, MBA, Chair Referred to: Reference Committee A At the 2022 Annual Meeting, the House of Delegates referred Resolution 111, which was 1 cosponsored by the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation and the Ohio 2 delegation s. Resolution 111 -A-22 asked the American Medical Association ( AMA ) to 1) advocate 3 that coverage rules for Medicaid \"episodes of care\" be carefully reviewed to ensure that they do not 4 incentivize limiting medically necessary services for patients to allow better reimbursement for 5 recipients of the bundled payment; 2) study th e issue of bundled payments and medically necessary 6 care with a report back to explore the unintended long- term consequences on health care 7 expenditures, physician reimbursement, and patient outcomes; and 3) advocate that functional 8 improvement be a key ta rget outcome for bundled payments. 9 10 The Board of Trustees ass igned this item to the Council on Medical Service for a report back to the 11 House of Delegates. This report adds to the body of reports developed by the Council on alternative 12 payment models (APM s) by providing background information specific to bundled/episode -based 13 payment model s, summarizing the literature on prominent Medicare and Medicaid models, 14 reviewing relevant AMA policy and advocacy, and making policy recommendations. 15 16 BACKGROUND 17 18 Bundled or episode -based payments are a type of APM in which a single comprehensive payment 19 amount covers services delivered by multiple providers during an episode of care. An episode of 20 care is the care delivery process for a certain condition or procedu re delivered within a defined 21 period of time. State Medicaid programs use the term episodes of care to describe payment models 22 in which a single bundled payment is made for services associated with the treatment of a condition 23 or procedure. The models aim to lessen variations in cost and quality by incentivizing providers 24 (e.g., physicians, hospitals, post -acute care facilities, and others providing services during the 25 episode) to work together and manage costs without compromising care quality. Providers able to 26 keep costs below a risk -adjusted target price for an episode may share in any savings and, 27 conversely, those exceeding that threshold may incur financial penalties. Savings can be generated 28 if, as is often the case, the target price is a discount of what has historically been paid, or if lower - 29 cost facilities and providers are utilized during the episode. To guard against underserving patients, 30 some models impose limits on gainsharing payments and/or require tha t certain quality metric s be 31 met. 32 33 Medicare, state Medicaid programs, and many private insurer s have adopted bundled or episode - 34 based payment models to varying degrees with perinatal and joint replacement models increasingly 35 prevalent across multiple paye rs. Although Medicare has administered bundled payments for many 36 years, provisions in the Affordable Care Act ( ACA) accelerated their use, along with other APMs, 37 CMS Rep. 04- A-23 -- page 2 of 18 by establishing the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) and authorizing it to 1 develop and test new payment models without the need for Congressional approval. In 2015, the 2 Department of Health and Human Services announced national goals for transitioning to value - 3 based medicine and APMs; the same year, Congress passed the Medicare Access and CHIP 4 Reauthorization Act (MACRA), which among other things established incentive payments for 5 physicians to participate in advanced APMs. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ( CMS ) 6 and a handful of states continue to experiment with episode -based payment approache s, such as 7 lengthier and more inclusive episodes and those that span multiple provider s and/or site s of service . 8 Importantly, there is substantial variance among bundled/ episode payment designs, with larger and 9 more widely implemented models including Medicare's Bundled Payments for Care Improvement 10 (BPCI) Advanced initiative and the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR) model. 11 12 Medicare bundle s have inform ed som e Medicaid episodes of care although states have generally 13 adapted APM s to suit the unique needs of their Medicaid enrollees and health care in their states .1 14 Notably, s tate Medicaid programs and Medicaid providers are at various stages of implementation 15 of value -based payment reforms and, to address ongoing budget pressures, m any states have 16 pursued APM s to reduce cost growth in Medicaid while improving care quality . Because 70 17 percent of Medicaid enrollees are enrolled in managed care ,2 state s often use contracting strategies 18 with managed care organizations (MCO s) to leverage the use of value- based payment s, including 19 episodes of care . For example, more than half of states (20 of 37) that contract with MCOs to 20 manage care delivered to Medicaid enrollees require those plans to make a certain percentage of 21 provider payments through APMs , while some states require MCOs to adopt specific models . 22 Several states use financial incentives \u2014and /or penalties \u2014to compel MCOs to pursue value -based 23 payment models. To date, the use of episode -based payments has generally been limited to those 24 states that prescriptively define and require such models, including for joint replacement and 25 perinatal episod es of care.3 In a 2021 Kaiser Family Foundation survey, eight states (CO, NM, NY, 26 OH, PA, TN, VT, and VA) reported implementing episode s of care in Medicaid , although this 27 number changes as states implement new models while sunsetting others.4 28 29 Most, but not all, bundled payment models are voluntary; the CJR initiative, which is mandatory in 30 certain areas and voluntary in others, and Medicaid models in some states, are exceptions. Beyond 31 that, bundled payment initiatives differ from each other in terms of duration, payment rules, and the 32 types of services included. Episodes can range from shorter durations to lengthier periods, as for 33 perinatal mo dels that span the prenatal through postpartum periods . Although payments for 34 episodes of care can be determined prospective ly or based on fee- for-service with retrospective 35 adjustments , most of the models discussed in this report adjust payments retrospectively . 36 Additionally, a dd-on payments covering high- cost or outlier cases may be made available to 37 varying degrees , depending on the model design. With respect to outliers, Policy H -385.907 38 advocates that bundled payments should recognize the differences in patients' needs and payment 39 amounts should be risk stratified to reflect patients who need more resource -intensive services. The 40 menu of services paid for in a bundle also varies significantly across models and affects the types 41 of providers that participate. Notably, t he CJR model include s most Part A and Part B services, 42 except for hospice and a few other carve -outs, while other models pay for a narrower set of 43 services. 44 45 Physician participation in bundled payment models has increased steadily over the past decade, as 46 evidenced by data fr om the AMA's Physician Practice Benchmark Surveys, which are nationally 47 representative samples of non -federal physicians who provide care to patients at least 20 48 hours per week. According to recent Benchmark surveys, 32.0 percent of physicians were in 49 practices involved in bundled payments in 2012. This increased to 34.8 percent in 2016 and topped 50 40 percent in 2020 and 2022 for a cumulative increase of eight percentage points. Additionally, in 51 CMS Rep. 04-A-23 -- page 3 of 18 2022, an average of 10 percent of practice revenue (at the phys ician level) came from bundled 1 payments.5 2 3 The main obstacles to effective bundled payments are accurately defining care episodes, pricing the 4 bundles, and ensuring adequate payment for care provided by all team members across all sites of 5 service. Physicians have expressed concerns regarding both the financial arrangements and 6 administrative burdens incurred, including the degree of financial risk required to participate, the 7 potential for financial strain if the fixed payment amount does not accurately r eflect the costs of the 8 episode, the potential for decreased payments, and administrative hurdles, especially when 9 participating in more than one APM. Additional concerns include high dropout rates among 10 hospitals participating in some models , the potential for some models to become mandatory, and 11 the ability of small physician practices to participate. In the Whereas clauses, the authors of 12 Resolution 111-A-22 highlighted concerns about the occurrence of unrelated\u2014and costly \u2014events 13 during a care episode, increased expenses for complex patients, the need for skilled nursing care by 14 some patients, and possible incentives to lessen costs by decreasing patient access to services they 15 may need. 16 17 Defining what is related and unrelated to a bundle can be problema tic with episode models, yet 18 decisions about covered services are critical to ensuring appropriate payment. Care for unrelated 19 conditions and procedures that takes place within the duration of an episode can be costly and 20 potentially increase spending beyond the target price of the bundle. Importantly, the AMA 21 maintains that APMs should be designed by physicians or with significant input from physicians in 22 part so they can influence decisions about covered services and advocate that care for unrelated 23 events (e.g., cataract surgery during a 90-day lower extremity joint replacement ( LEJR ) episode) 24 not be paid for out of the bundled payment. The AMA also advocates that financial risk 25 requirements be limited to costs that physicians participating in an APM are able to influence or 26 control. 27 28 An additional shortcoming of many of the larger Medicare bundled payment models is that they 29 start with a hospitalization for a procedure. If, for example, episodes began with an evaluation for 30 hip, knee, or back pain, or other condition, there would be more opportunities to save money and 31 improve quality by, for example, engaging in patient- physician shared decision making strategies 32 that could potentially prevent hospitalizations and procedures altogether. Specific to Medicaid, 33 staffing, resou rce, and leadership capacity to develop and implement new models can be major 34 obstacles to implementing payment initiatives and , for this reason, state Medicaid directors have 35 asked CMS to provide upfront resources for states to engage in delivery system and payment 36 reforms. 6 Additionally, risk thresholds may dissuade some Medicaid providers, especially those 37 practicing in states with particularly low payment rates, from participating in episode -based 38 payment models if they feel they cannot take on financial risk . Importantly , Medicaid enrollees 39 may have complex care needs and /or experience inequities in social determinants of health \u2014such 40 as housing instability, food insecurity, or lack of transportation\u2014 that impact their care and health 41 outcomes. They also face unique barriers to care and may churn in and out of Medicaid, which 42 could lead some Medicaid provider s to believe they will be disproportionately penalized under 43 APMs without sufficient risk adjustment . 44 45 Many of the se obstacles have been addressed in previous reports and policy development by the 46 Council on Medical Service . Council on Medical Service Report 9-A-16 established foundational 47 policy on physician -focused APMs while Council on Medical Service Report 10-A-17 focused on 48 reducing some of the barriers to participating in these models and the need for changes to risk 49 adjustment systems, attribution methods, and performance target setting. AMA policy established 50 by Council on Medical Service Report 10-A-19 addressed concerns raised by many that physicians 51 CMS Rep. 04-A-23 -- page 4 of 18 serving people who are sicker or experiencing poverty are disproportionately penalized by APMs. 1 Council on Medical Service Report 3-I-19 established new policy on improving risk adjustment in 2 APMs, including that risk stratification systems should use fair and accurate payments based on 3 patient characteristics, and that risk adjustment systems should use fair and accurate outlier 4 payments if spending on an individual patient exceeds a predefined threshold. Concerns about 5 APMs, and AMA advocacy to improve upon value- based payment models, were also discussed in 6 Council on Medical Service Report 2-A-22 , which focused on prospective payment model best 7 practices for independent private practice. 8 9 EVIDENCE OF EFFECTIVENESS 10 11 Select Medicare Bundled Payment Models 12 13 Bundled/episode- based paymen ts have been implemented for numerous surgical procedures and 14 medical conditions and remain a leading value- based payment reform in Medicare. L acking the 15 capacity to thoroughly study the impact of all Medicare bundled payment models implemented 16 over the years, the Council reviewed independent evaluations of the larger CMS initiatives and 17 more recent analyses in the literature e xamin ing the impact of multiple bund les on Medicare 18 spending, quality of care, and unintended consequences. Informatio n on a unique episode program 19 for non-hospital physicians developed as part of Maryland's statewide CMMI initiative is also 20 provided. 21 22 BPCI : One of the largest Medicare models was t he voluntary B PCI initiative \u2014four model designs 23 that offer ed episode- based payments to over 1,000 hospitals, physicians, and post- acute care 24 providers for 48 different clinical episodes over five years (2013-2018). 7 Consistent with previous 25 findings, t he final BPCI evaluation showed tha t the initiative reduced Medicare spending per 26 episode due primarily to decline s in institutional post -acute car e utilization and decreases in the 27 number of skilled nursing facility (SNF) days for those that ne eded SNF care . However, after 28 accounting for reconciliation payments to eligible providers, BPCI did not increase net Medicare 29 savings ; instead, the initiative resulted in net increased Medicare spending beyond what it was 30 estimated to be in absence of the model.8 Evaluations further demonstrated that BPCI generally did 31 not affect quality of care as measured by emergency department visits, mortality, and hospital 32 readmissions. T he evidence was mixed and included both positive and negative associations 33 between BPCI models and patient functioning,9 and fewer BPCI patient s reported the highest level 34 of satisfaction with their care.10 Importantly, t wo studies analyzing outcomes of high -risk patients 35 found that participation in BPCI did not adversely impact their quality of care.11,12 36 37 BPCI Advanced : Building on the experiences and lessons learned from BPCI, the BPCI Advanced 38 initiative \u2014which includes bundles with one risk track and a 90-day duration\u2014was launched in 39 2018 and has been extended to run through 2025. BPCI Advanced links performance on select 40 quality metrics to incentive payments and qualifies as an Advanced APM. Accordingly, 41 participating physicians who meet certain cost thresholds may be eligible for a five percent APM 42 incentive payment . Participation in BPCI Advanced is currently voluntary and notably widespread , 43 with 1,295 hospitals and physician groups participating in years one and two (2018 and 2019) and 44 more than 2,000 participa ting in year three (2020). 13 CMS continues to use results from its 45 independent evaluations to refine the initiative , which reduced episode payments overall in 2018 46 and 2019 and produc ed greater savings ($1,353 per episode) for surgical episodes than for medical 47 episodes ($564 per episode).14 After accounting for reconciliation payments made to BPCI 48 Advanced providers in 2018 and 2019, the independent evaluator found that the initiative resulted 49 in net Medicare savings for surgical episodes and net increased Medicare spending for medical 50 episodes with an overall increase in Medicare spending of $65.7 million.15 Consistent with BPCI 51 CMS Rep. 04- A-23 -- page 5 of 18 and other bundles, episode savings were primarily attributed to lower payments to post -acute care 1 sites, including SNFs and inpatient rehabilitation facilities . Importantly, q uality of care was not 2 adversely impacted ; in fact, BPCI Advanced has been found by the evaluators to reduce 3 readmissions for surgical episodes and to not worsen mortality rates.16 A separate study of BPCI 4 Advanced, published in 2022, also found the initiative to be associated with a net increase in 5 Medicare spending because bonuses paid to eligible hospitals exceeded episode payment 6 reductions.17 This study further found that hospital s caring for historically marginalized 7 populations received large bonuses under BPCI Advanced , possibly due to initial episode target 8 pricing, which was subsequently adjusted by CMS .18 9 10 CJR: The CJR model pays for care episodes that extend through 90 days after discharge from both 11 inpatient and outpatient settings for some of the most common surgeries among Medicare 12 patients\u2014hip , knee , and, more recently, ankle replacements, also referred to as LEJR.19 CJR began 13 in 2016 and has been mandato ry since 2017 for hospitals in 34 geographic areas where spending 14 had been historically high.20 Over CJR's first four years , payments across LEJR episodes in CJR's 15 mandatory areas were 5.2 percent lower than the baseline , with payments averaging $1,511 less per 16 episode. An independent evaluation estimat ed small net savings for the Medicare program in 17 earlier years but was unable to conclude definitively that Medicare realized net savings over the 18 first four years of the initiative . Over the four -year pe riod, independent evaluators estimated that, 19 after accounting for reconcil iation payments, net savings ranged from a possible $15.3 million 20 more in Medicare spending to $167.2 million in savings .21 Similar to other surgical bundles, 21 changes in post -acute care utilization drove the decrease in average episode payments, as fewer 22 patients were discharged to SNFs and rehab ilitation facilities , and patients who went to SNFs spent 23 fewer days there. When compared to the control group, a larger proportion of CJR patients were 24 discharged to home health agenc ies, which cost significantly less than institutional post -acute 25 care.22 CJR patient care qual ity, as measured by unplanned readmissions, emergency department 26 use, and mortality rates , was maintained over the four -year period. F urthermore, patients in the 27 CJR and control groups reported similar functional status gains , pain levels, and overall 28 satisfaction , although some CJR patients reported that they required more caregiving help at home 29 and CJR hip replacement patients reported less improvement on three of eight functional status 30 measures.23 In terms of unintended consequences , evaluat ors identified a decrease in patient 31 complexity that could indicate some level of risk selection but no evidence of increased LEJR 32 volume .24 Although a New England Journal of Medicine study of CJR's first two years did not find 33 adverse effects on complications, hospital readmissions , or mortality , it did not look at functional 34 status, pain, and patient satis faction indicators . This study examined whether the CJR program 35 incentivizes hospitals to 1 ) treat healthier rather than sicker patients (risk selection ); and/or 2) 36 reduce the use of SNF and inpatient rehabilitatio n. With regard to risk selection, the study noted 37 inconsistent evidence in previous studies and no changes in patient selection in t he current study 38 other than some evidence that fewer disabled patients under went procedures.25 Because CJR did 39 not negatively a ffect complications, readmissions, or mortality, the study authors concluded that 40 hospitals may have correctly identified patients who could be appropriately discharged home with 41 home health instead of being referred to institutional post- acute settings .26 42 43 A systemic review of CMS's Acute Care Episode Demonstration (a three- year bundled payment 44 model for inpatient cardiac and orthopedic surgeries) , BPCI, and CJR initiatives found no 45 associations between these Medicare model s and 1) quality of care \u2014as measured by readmissions, 46 emergency department visits, and mortality\u2014 and 2) unintended consequences, such as increased 47 utilization or risk selection .27 This review further found that , in six out of 16 studies that evaluated 48 spending, bundled payments significantly decreased episode cost s; importantly, these six studies 49 focused on orthopedic surgery and four of the six looked at LEJR episodes. Other clinical or 50 medical episodes were not found to be associated with episode savings .28 A separate review of 16 51 CMS Rep. 04- A-23 -- page 6 of 18 Medicare bundled payment initiatives similarly found that Medicare spending decreased for LEJR 1 episode s but not for most other bundled payment model s unless provider fees were heavily 2 discounted.29 This review found limited evidence of risk avoidance across models although the 3 evidence was mixed.30 The authors highlighted the association between bundled payments and 4 post-acute care sp ending, with payments and service intensity more likely to decrease under 5 bundle s that included post -acute care services in the bundle and increased post -acute care 6 utilization in models that did not include post -acute care services in the bundle. Like other studies, 7 no association was found between bundled payments and increased episode volume .31 8 9 Episode Programs in Maryland : Within its Total Cost of Care All- Payer Model, M aryland has 10 several CMMI -approved advanced payment initiative s specific to that state, including the Episode 11 Quality Improvement Program (EQIP) launched in 2022 for specialist physicians in Medicare.32 12 This program provides opportunit ies for more non- hospital providers to participate in bundles 13 relevant to a range of specialties, including gastroenterology, cardiology, and orthopedics , which 14 were implemented in year one , as well as additional episodes that have been rolled out since . As of 15 January 2023, 43 medical specialties were represented in 45 episodes available under EQIP .33 16 17 Select Medicaid Episodes of Care 18 19 Although Medicaid programs employ a range of value -based payment programs, including 20 episodes of care for various conditions and procedures , they have not been as high profile as some 21 Medicare- focused model s. Furthermore, while there is a wealth of published studies of Medicare 22 bundled payment initiatives , the research literature is less robust for Medicaid models and not all 23 states implementing episodes of care make cost and performance data publicly available. 24 Accordingly, the Council reviewed available data from select states tha t were early adopters of 25 episodes of care , including Tennessee, Ohio, and Arkansas , as well as a Medicaid and CHIP 26 Payment and Access Commission ( MACPAC ) analysis of perinatal episodes implemented across 27 three states . 28 29 Perinatal : Because Medicaid covers nearly half (42 percent in 2020) of all births in the U.S.,34 30 several states have implemented episode- based payments for perinatal care. A 2021 MACPAC 31 analysis reviewed perinatal episodes of care implemented in Arkansas, Colorado, and Tennessee. 32 Although the Arkansas and Tennessee models were generally viewed positively in terms o f 33 reducing cost variations , Arkansas sunset its model , which had been mandatory, in 2021, due in 34 part to administrative burdens on providers and diminishing returns as cost variations narrowed 35 over time. The Tennessee and Arkansas models reduced costs per episode but produced mixed 36 results on quality measures.35 Because the Colorado model began later, in 2020, with only a few 37 participants at the start , data on its impact on episode costs was not available at the time this report 38 was written . Although high -risk pregnancies were excluded from episode- based payments in 39 Arkansas and Tennessee, the Colorado model , which is voluntary, include s some high -risk patients, 40 including those with substance use disorder s. Importantly , while certain quality measures are 41 tracked by states, there is no published evidence on the impact of perinatal episodes of care on 42 maternal health or birth outcomes . Moreover, incentives are generally not tied to key metric s 43 related to reductions in mater nal morbidity and mortality, or impact on health disparities.36 44 45 Tennessee : Aside from its perinatal model, T ennessee 's Medicaid program, known as TennCare, 46 has administered close to 50 episodes of care since 2013 . TennCare reported that , in 2018, 22 of 47 the 27 episodes of care tied to incentive payments saved the state an estimated $38.3 million. The 48 five that did not show savings were for acute percutaneous coronary intervention, non- acute 49 percutaneous coronary intervention, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, bariatric surgery, and human 50 immunodeficiency virus episodes, w hich the state describ ed as low volume , making savings more 51 CMS Rep. 04- A-23 -- page 7 of 18 difficult to achieve. Episodes producing the most savings in 2018 included the perinatal model 1 ($13.5 million in savings), respiratory infection episode ($6.8 million), and the asthma acute 2 exacerbation episode ($ 4.2 million).37 Quality of care, as measured by certain performance metrics, 3 was mostly maintained or improved except for low -volume episodes in wh ich quality metric 4 performance declined.38 Because TennCare waived all episodes of care incentive s through 2021 5 due to the Covid- 19 pandemic , more recent evaluation data was not available for review . 6 7 Ohio : Ohio 's Department of Medicaid, which has administered 43 episodes of care since 2015, 8 similarly suspended its episodes of care incentives between 2020 and 2022 due to Covid- 19's 9 impact on the state's providers . Data from 2019 show ed that Ohio's episodes of car e covered more 10 than 1.5 million patients that year, or 51 percent of the state's Medicaid enrollees.39 From 2013 to 11 2019, Ohio participated in CMMI's State Innovation Model (SIM) initiative , which helped 12 facilitate the design and launch of the state's episodes of care as well as its comprehensive primary 13 care program. Results from the first two years of Ohio's episodes of care program were generally 14 positiv e and showed reductions in average episode costs overall with no adverse e ffects on care 15 quality. For the nine episodes linked to incentives in 2017 (asthma exacerbation, chronic 16 obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, perinatal , cholecystectomy, upper respiratory 17 infection, gastrointestinal infection, colonoscopy, and 18 esophagogastroduodenoscopy), a verage non -risk-adjusted spending decreased by 0.9 percent 19 annually, saving an estimated $31.8- $92.2 million .40 That same year, providers received $4 million 20 in positive incentives and were accountable for $4 million in negative incentives.41 In its final SIM 21 report issued in 2019, the Ohio Department of Medicaid identified several factors that were key to 22 the successful design and implementation of its episodes of care, including ongoing provider 23 engagement, addressing provider challenges, streamlining reporting burdens, engaging private 24 insurers in the state, facilitating consistency across public and private health plans, and aligning 25 episodes of care with population health priorities. The episodes of care in itiative further benefited 26 from strong leadership in the state, a dedicated innovation team, and alignment with federal 27 models. In 2019, Ohio's episodes of care model was approved as an advanced APM.42 28 29 Arkansas: Support from the federal SIM initiative also helped Arkansas develop new payment 30 models a nd refine and expand episodes of care that were first implemented by the state's Medicaid 31 program in 2011.43 By the end of the SIM initiative in 2016, Arkansas had produced 14 episodes of 32 care that were mandatory for Medicaid providers and voluntary for the state's two private payers.44 33 Challenges early on ranged from a degree of provider hesitation and pushback to evidence that 34 coding had been use d by some providers to avoid triggering certain episode s. The state reported 35 that average costs for attention -deficit/hyperactivity disorder and joint replacement episodes had 36 decreased significantly while the costs of other episodes, and episodes of care overall, remained 37 relatively constant.45 One of the most prevalent models in Arkansas , for upper respiratory tract 38 infections (URIs) , showed significant quality improvements af ter two years , including greater 39 reductions in antibiotic use and improvements in appropriate care for children, relative to a 40 comparison group . However, emergency department visits increased during that time span and 41 some physicians reported in focus groups using alternate coding to avoid triggering an episode .46 42 Between 2011 and 2014, URI -related professional and outpatient spending increased while 43 spending on prescription drugs (antibiotics and others) did not change . Over the same time period , 44 the state's perinatal episode was found to decrease emergency department visits but increase 45 inpatient hospital utilization and, importantly, perinatal expenditures declined, and improvements 46 were made across most quality metric s.47 A 2020 analysis of perinatal and URI episodes of care in 47 Arkansas concluded that : linking incentives to performance metrics may help improve quality of 48 care; episodes of care may successfully discourage the overuse of services; and unintended 49 conseque nces are possible , including episode avoidance through coding, a shift of services to 50 outside of the episode , and increased emergency department use.48 51 CMS Rep. 04- A-23 -- page 8 of 18 A study of Arkansas' perinatal episode that included privately insured patients found that spending 1 decreased 3.8 percent when compared to nearby states, with savings due primarily to decreased 2 inpatient care prices.49 Notably, although some states implementing episodes of care involve 3 commercial payer s in their program design and implementatio n, fewer published analyses have 4 assessed the impact of bundled /episode -based payments among commercially insured patient s or 5 across multiple payers . Accordingly, much less is known about the impact of commercial model s 6 on spending and care quality. A 2022 meta -analysis looking at various value -based care models in 7 the commercial sector , including nine studies of bundled/episode -based payments , found mixed 8 results on spending and quality but cited significant savings incurred under Unite dHealthcare's 9 cancer bundle .50 A recent study of the use of bundled payments for certain surgical procedures 10 among self -insured employers found considerable reductions in episode prices.51 As more research 11 becomes available and models are refined , increased alignment of bundled/episode -based payments 12 across Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurers may help expand successful models and align 13 quality reporting . 14 15 AMA POLICY 16 17 The AMA has an abundance of policies addressing persistent concerns with value- based payment 18 and APMs (Policies D -385.963, H -385.913, H -385.908, and H -390.849). Under Policy D -385.963, 19 the AMA work s with CMS and other payers on evolving payment reforms and ensuring sufficient 20 payments so that patients and families have access to care coordination support s that they need to 21 achieve optimal outcomes. Policy H-385.913 supports goals that should be pursued as part of an 22 APM, including that models be designed by physicians or with significant input from physicians, 23 provide flexibility to physicians to deliver the care their patients need, provide adequate and 24 predictable resources to support the services physician practices need to deli ver to patients (and 25 include mechanisms for updating payment amounts), limit physician accountability to aspects of 26 spending and quality that they can reasonably influence, and avoid placing physician practices at 27 substantial financial risk. Policy H -385.913 also directs the AMA to continue to educate physicians 28 about APMs and provide educational resources and support . Policy H -385.908 urges CMS to limit 29 financial risk requirements to costs that physicians participating in an APM have the ability to 30 influen ce or control and directs the AMA to work with stakeholders to improve risk adjustment 31 systems, attribution methods, and performance target setting. Policy H -390.849 advocates for 32 physician payment reforms that : promote improved patient access to high- quality, cost -effective 33 care; are designed with input from physicians; ensure that physicians have an appropriate level of 34 authority over bonus or shared- savings distributions; and include ongoing evaluations to ensure the 35 reforms are improving patient care an d increasing value. 36 37 Policy H -390.849 also opposes bundling of payments in ways that limit care or otherwise interfere 38 with a patient's ability to provide high quality care, while Policy H -385.913 supports the provision 39 of flexibility under APMs so that physicians can deliver the care patients need. Policy H -385.908 40 focuses on reducing barriers to APMs, including limiting financial risk requirements to costs that 41 physicians can control and working with stakeholders to improve attribution methods, risk 42 adjustment systems, and performance target setting. Under Policy H -70.949, the AMA will take 43 steps to ensure that public and private payers do not bundle services inappropriately; Policy 44 D-390.961 directs the AMA to work with appropriate officials to ensure t hat bundled payments, if 45 implemented, do not lead to hospital -controlled payments to physicians. Additional policy on 46 physician- focused payment reforms includes Policies D -390.953, H -390.844, H -450.931, and 47 H-450.961. Policy H -450.931 directs the AMA to help physician practices address concerns about 48 APMs and harmonize key components of APMs across multiple payers, including performance 49 measures. 50 CMS Rep. 04-A-23 -- page 9 of 18 Improving risk adjustment across payment models is addressed by Policies H-385.907 and 1 H-285.957, and D-385.952, which also support linking quality measures and payments to outcomes 2 specific to high -risk populations and reductions in health care disparities. Policy 3 H-385.907 supports: 1) risk stratification systems that use fair and accurate payments based on 4 patient characteristics, including socioeconomic factors; 2) risk adjustment systems that use fair 5 and accurate outlier payments if spending on a patient exceeds a pre- defined threshold, and fair and 6 accurate payments for external price changes beyond the physician's control ; 3) risk adjustment 7 systems that use risk corridors using fair and accurate payment if spending on all patients exceeds a 8 pre-defined percentage above the payments ; 4) accountability measures that exclude from risk 9 adjustment methodologies any services that the physician does not deliver, order, or otherwise have 10 the ability to influence; and 5) risk adjustment mechanisms that allow for flexibility to account for 11 changes in science and practic e. Policy H -165.837 advocates for protecting the patient -physician 12 relationship in the context of bundled payments and affirms the obligation of physicians to 13 prioritize patient care above financial interests. 14 15 AMA ADVOCACY 16 17 Many of the concerns about bundled/episode-based payment models have previously been 18 addressed by AMA policy and advocacy on payment reform and APMs . Key characteristics of 19 value- based care, including that new models and incentives must be tailored to the distinct 20 characteristics of different specialties and practice settings, were also incorporated into the 21 Medicare payment system principles crafted by the AMA in collaboration with 120 other physician 22 and health care organizations. T he AMA has work ed diligently over the years to improve MACRA 23 and advance the transition to value- based care and now lead s the charge to reform Medicare's 24 payment system to increase physician payment stability, reduce burnout, and improve the financial 25 viability of physician practices. Although the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 extended 26 the five percent advanced APM incentive payment for 12 months, the AMA is advocating that it be 27 extended for additional years. 28 29 The AMA continues to encourage and enable physician participation in physician-focused APMs , 30 including bundled/episode- based payments. The AMA believes that well -designed, patient- 31 centered APMs can provide significant opportunities to improve the quality and outcomes of 32 patients' care in ways that also lower growth in health care spending . However, the AMA 33 maintains that physicians must be involved in the design of APMs to ensure that models 34 successfully remove certain barriers and do not require physicians to be accountable for spending 35 or outcomes they cannot control. The AMA continues to carefully examine APMs that are 36 proposed by CMS and provide feedback to the agency regarding needed modifications, including 37 when APMs impose unreasonable r equirements on physicians or require them to take on excessive 38 financial risk. Because the AMA believes that APMs are significantly improved when physicians 39 are directly and actively involved in their design, the AMA continually advocates for consideration 40 of physician input on model s and approval of APMs that have been designed by physicians. 41 42 The AMA works closely with national medical specialty societies to review proposed APMs, 43 recommend model improvements, and comment on regulations governing APMs. A more recent 44 example is the AMA's advocacy focused on Medicare's proposed Radiation Oncology (RO) 45 Model, a bundled payment for cancer patients receiving radiotherapy , which the AMA urged be 46 delayed so that CMS could work with radiation oncology specialty societies to redesign some of 47 the model's key features.52 The RO Model that CMS had previously developed could have had 48 serious unintended consequences for patients because practices would have been mandated to 49 participate and take steep payment cuts. Acco rdingly, the AMA expressed general support for the 50 creation of a bundled payment model for radiation oncology but advocated that several change s be 51 CMS Rep. 04-A-23 -- page 10 of 18 made to CMS's proposal , namely that payments be stratified based on patients' clinical 1 characteristics, adjusted to account for the higher costs of delivering services in rural areas, and 2 adjusted annually to reflect changes in evidence, technology, and inflation.53 The AMA has further 3 urged CMS to conduct a limited scale test of the RO Model on a voluntary basis rather than 4 mandating participation in an untested model. 5 6 In 2015, the AMA recommended numerous changes to the proposed CJR model and urged CMS to 7 make participation voluntary and available to physicians in all localities. Among other 8 modifications to its original design, the AMA recommended that payments be risk -adjusted based 9 on patients' functional status and other characteristics that affect the types of post -acute care they 10 need so that physicians could assign patients to one of several acuity/risk levels and receive higher 11 payments for higher-risk patients.54 Additional advocacy on CJR and other episode- based payment 12 models has repeatedly urged CMS to incorporate input from relevant national medical specialty 13 societies in model design and revisions; listen to affected specialty societies that have experience 14 with the different risks facing patients treated under the models; allow voluntary participation; 15 begin episodes at the time of diagnoses of a condition instead of at hospital admission; and ensure 16 that payment is adequate and predictable while limiting physicians' accountability to costs within 17 their control. More recent AMA advocacy with CMS on episode- based paymen t model s in 18 Medicare included support for bundled payments for office- based management of patients with 19 substance use disorders and bundled payments for chronic pain management. 20 21 To be successful, the AMA believes a physician- focused APM needs three key co mponents: 22 23 1. Flexibility for physicians to deliver the most appropriate services to meet patients' needs ; 24 2. Adequate payments to support the costs physicians incur in delivering high-quality care; 25 and 26 3. Accountability by physicians for delivering high-quality services and avoiding unnecessary 27 services, but without penalties for things that physicians cannot control. 28 29 The AMA has held educational seminars about APMs for physicians and organized several 30 workshops in which physicians have shared their experiences in designing and implementing 31 APMs. Physicians who want to learn more about episodes of care and other APMs are encouraged 32 to read the following AMA resources: E valuating Medicaid Value -Based Care Models, Evaluating 33 Bundled or Episode -Based Contracts, and Medicare Alternative Payment Models . 34 35 DISCUSSION 36 37 Although the concerns highlighted in referred Resolution 111-A-22 focused primarily on Medicaid 38 episodes of care, the Council reviewed available research on both Medicaid and Medicare bundled 39 payment models. Evidence in the literature suggests that certain Medicare bundles may contain 40 overall costs more effectively than fee- for-service payment but, a fter accounting for provider 41 bonuse s, aside from joint replacement models, most have not produced net Medicare savings . 42 Additionally, although studies have been mixed and vary across initiatives , most bundled payment 43 models have neither significantly impro ved nor worsened quality of care. 55 The Council found that 44 LEJR bundles, and some perinatal episodes of care, have produced the most \u2014but still modest\u2014 45 savings. LEJR episode savings have been driven by reductions in institutional post- acute care (e.g., 46 SNFs and inpatient rehabilitation facilities) spending while hospital pricing contributed to 47 reductions in perinatal episode spending. The Council was unable to locate published studies 48 analyzing the impact of bundled/episode -based payment models on physician payment; however, 49 we reviewed several studies look ing at other possible unintended consequences of these models . 50 For example, studies have found some evidence of risk selection across certain Medicare bundles, 51 CMS Rep. 04-A-23 -- page 11 of 18 although the evidence has been mixed , and no evidence of increased episode volume , which had 1 been an early concern among some stakeholders . A study of episodes of care in Arkansas reveal ed 2 other possible unintended consequences, including episode avoidance through coding, a shift of 3 some services outside of the bundles, and increased emergency department use. 4 5 Because the evidence is clear that the savings accrued under LEJR episodes ha s been due to 6 decreased spending on SNFs and inpatient rehabilitation f acilities , some physicians have 7 questioned whether patient access to medically necessary care, including SNF services, could 8 potentially be limited . The Council believes that performance metrics measur ing key patient- 9 centered outcomes, including functional improvements after orthopedic and other procedures , are 10 important and necessary checks on the risk that some models may underserve patients. Because the 11 AMA already has extensive policy on APMs, we recom mend amending Polic ies H-390.849[2, 3 ] 12 and D-385.952[1, 2] to address this concern instead of crafting a separate policy statement specific 13 to bundled/episode-based payments. 14 15 Although evidence across models is limited, high- risk patients have not been found to be adversely 16 impacted under the BPCI initiative; more research is needed on how historically marginalized 17 patients fare, in terms of outcomes, under a broader range of episodes. One study we reviewed 18 found that hospitals serving historically marginalized individuals performed well, and received 19 large bonuses, under BPCI Advanced ; however, more studies are needed to ensure that 20 implementation of episode- based models is meaningfully support ing equity goals. The Counci l 21 previously addressed concerns about the impact of APMs on high- risk populations and points to 22 Policy D-385.952, which we recommend amending. To address other concerns and obstacles under 23 bundled/episode-based payment models, the Council recommends reaffi rmation of Policy 24 H-385.907, which supports fair and accurate risk adjustment systems, and Policy H-385.913, which 25 outlines goals to be pursued as part of physician- focused APMs \u2014including that models be 26 designed by physicians or with significant input from physicians, provide flexibility to physicians 27 to deliver the care patients need, provide adequate and predictable resources, and avoid placing 28 physician practices at substantial financia l risk \u2014and directs the AMA to continue to work with 29 national medical specialty societies and state medical associations to educate physicians on APMs. 30 31 As previously noted, one of the frustrations with episode -based payment models concerns the 32 definition of related or unrelated services. For example, since some LEJR models include most 33 Medicare Part A and Part B services, payment for seemingly unrelated procedures (e.g., eye, skin, 34 or sinus surgeries) completed within 90 days of a joint replacement m ay be paid for out of the 35 bundled payment. AMA policy addresses this concern by advocating that physician accountability 36 be limited to aspects of spending and quality that they can reasonably influence or control. Notably, 37 the services covered under joint replacement models can vary significantly across payers so that 38 services included in a state Medicaid model may differ from CJR's list of covered services. 39 40 Although the Council discussed the need for bundled payment models to clearly define the services 41 included and allow mechanisms for shifting unrelated services outside of the bundle, we believe 42 this is best addressed at the design stage, with meaningful physician involvement, as highlighted by 43 Policy H-385.913. The Council encourages physicians interested in participating in bundled 44 payment models to determine ahead of time which services and Current Procedural Terminology 45 codes are included and not included in an episode , and to review the AMA's Evaluating Bundled or 46 Episode- Based Contracts for more information. Finally , the Council believes well -designed, 47 patient -centered bundled paymen t models can improve care quality and patient outcomes in ways 48 that also lower growth in health care spending. Designing these models to w ork effectively for 49 patients, physicians, and payers remains challenging, and ongoing refinements to models may be 50 needed to ensure optimal patient outcomes as these initiatives continue to expand. 51 CMS Rep. 04-A-23 -- page 12 of 18 RECOMMENDATIONS 1 2 The Council on Medical Service recommends that the following be adopted in lieu of Resolutio n 3 111-A-22, and that the remainder of the report be filed: 4 5 1.

Rep. 04- A-23 -- page 16 of 18 APPENDIX Policies Recommended for Reaffirmation and Amendment Improving Risk Adjustment in Alternative Payment Models H -385.907 Our AMA supports: (1) risk stratification systems that use fair and accurate payments based on patient characteristics, including socioeconomic factors, and the treatment that would be expected to result in the need for more services or increase the risk of complications; (2) risk adjustment systems that use fair and accurate outlier payments if spending on an individual patient exceeds a pre-defined threshold or individual stop loss insurance at the insurer's cost; (3) risk adjustment systems that use risk corridors that use fair and accurate payment if spending on all patients exceeds a pre- defined percentage above the payments or support aggregate stop loss insurance at the insurer's cost; (4) risk adjustment systems that use fair and accurate payments for external price changes beyond the physician's control; (5) accountability measures that exclude from risk adjustment methodologies any services that the physician does not deliver, order, or otherwise have the ability to influence; and (6) risk adjustment mechanisms that allow for flexibility to account for changes in science and practice as to no t discourage or punish early adopters of effective therapy. (CMS Rep. 03, I -19; Reaffirmed: CMS Rep. 2, A -22) Physician -Focused Alternative Payment Models H -385.913 1. Our AMA recognizes that the physician is best suited to assume a leadership role in tra nsitioning to alternative payment models (APMs). 2. Our AMA supports that the following goals be pursued as part of an APM: A. Be designed by physicians or with significant input and involvement by physicians; B. Provide flexibility to physicians to delive r the care their patients need; C. Promote physician- led, team -based care coordination that is collaborative and patient -centered; D. Reduce burdens of Health Information Technology (HIT) usage in medical practice; E. Provide adequate and predictable resources to support the services physician practices need to deliver to patients, and should include mechanisms for regularly updating the amounts of payment to ensure they continue to be adequate to support the costs of high- quality care for patients; F. Limi t physician accountability to aspects of spending and quality that they can reasonably influence; G. Avoid placing physician practices at substantial financial risk; H. Minimize administrative burdens on physician practices; and I. Be feasible for physicians in every specialty and for practices of every size to participate in. 3. Our AMA supports the following guidelines to help medical societies and other physician organizations identify and develop feasible APMs for their members: A. Identify leading health conditions or procedures in a practice; B. Identify barriers in the current payment system; C. Identify potential solutions to reduce spending through improved care; D. Understand the patient population, including non- clinical factors, to id entify patients suitable for participation in an APM; E. Define services to be covered under an APM; F. Identify measures of the aspects of utilization and spending that physicians can control; G. Develop a core set of outcomes- focused quality measures inc luding mechanisms for regularly updating quality measures; H. Obtain and analyze data needed to demonstrate financial feasibility for practice, payers, and patients; I. Identify mechanisms for ensuring adequacy of payment; and J. Seek support from other physicians, physician groups, and patients. CMS Rep. 04-A-23 -- page 17 of 18 4. Our AMA encourages CMS and private payers to support the following types of technical assistance for physician practices that are working to implement successful APMs: A. Assistance in designing and utilizing a team approach that divides responsibilities among physicians and supporting allied health professionals; B. Assistance in obtaining the data and analysis needed to monitor and improve performance; C. Assistance in forming partnerships and alliances to achi eve economies of scale and to share tools, resources, and data without the need to consolidate organizationally; D. Assistance in obtaining the financial resources needed to transition to new payment models and to manage fluctuations in revenues and costs; and E. Guidance for physician organizations in obtaining deemed status for APMs that are replicable, and in implementing APMs that have deemed status in other practice settings and specialties. 5. Our AMA will continue to work with appropriate organizations, including national medical specialty societies and state medical associations, to educate physicians on alternative payment models and provide educational resources and support that encourage the physician-led development and implementation of alternative payment models. ( CMS Rep. 09, A-16 ; Reaffirmed: CMS Rep. 10, A-17; Reaffirmed: CMS Rep. 10, A-19 ; Reaffirmed: BOT Rep. 13, I-20; Reaffirmed: CMS Rep. 2, A-22 ) Alternative Payment Models and Vulnerable Populations D-385.952 Our AMA: (1) supports alternative payment models (APMs) that link quality measures and payments to outcomes specific to vulnerable and high -risk populations and reductions in health care disparities; (2) will continue to encourage the development and implementation of physician - focused APMs that pro vide services to improve the health of vulnerable and high- risk populations; and (3) will continue to advocate for appropriate risk adjustment of performance results based on clinical and social determinants of health to avoid penalizing physicians whose p erformance and aggregated data are impacted by factors outside of the physician's control. (CMS Rep. 10, A-19) Physician Payment Reform H -390.849 1. Our AMA will advocate for the development and adoption of physician payment reforms that adhere to the fol lowing principles: a) promote improved patient access to high- quality, cost -effective care; b) be designed with input from the physician community; c) ensure that physicians have an appropriate level of decision -making authority over bonus or shared -saving s distributions; d) not require budget neutrality within Medicare Part B; e) be based on payment rates that are sufficient to cover the full cost of sustainable medical practice; f) ensure reasonable implementation timeframes, with adequate support available to assist physicians with the implementation process; g) make participation options available for varying practice sizes, patient mixes, specialties, and locales; h) use adequate risk adjustment methodologies; i) incorporate incentives large enou gh to merit additional investments by physicians; j) provide patients with information and incentives to encourage appropriate utilization of medical care, including the use of preventive services and self -management protocols; k) provide a mechanism to ensure that budget baselines are reevaluated at regular intervals and are reflective of trends in service utilization; l) attribution processes should emphasize voluntary agreements between patients and physicians, minimize the use of algorithms or formulas, provide attribution information to physicians in a timely manner, and include formal mechanisms to allow physicians to verify and correct attribution data as necessary; and CMS Rep. 04- A-23 -- page 18 of 18 m) include ongoing evaluation processes to monitor the success of the reforms in a chieving the goals of improving patient care and increasing the value of health care services. 2. Our AMA opposes bundling of payments in ways that limit care or otherwise interfere with a physician's ability to provide high quality care to patients. 3. Our AMA supports payment methodologies that redistribute Medicare payments among providers based on outcomes, quality and risk- adjustment measures only if measures are scientifically valid, verifiable, accurate, and based on current data. 4. Our AMA will con tinue to monitor health care delivery and physician payment reform activities and provide resources to help physicians understand and participate in these initiatives. 5. Our AMA supports the development of a public -private partnership for the purpose of validating statistical models used for risk adjustment.

REPORT 07 OF THE COUNCIL ON MEDICAL SERVICE (A -23) Reporting Multiple Services Performed During a Single Patient Encounter (Resolution 824- I-22) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY At the 2022 Interim Meeting, the House of Delegates referred Resolution 824-I-22, which asked the A merican M edical A ssociation to recognize that there is greater value to the patient, improved access to care, greater patient satisfaction, and improved overall patient care by advocating for appropriate payment for multiple services (two or more) to be performed during a single patient encounter. \"Multiple services\" can refer to two evaluation and management ( E/M) services, a procedure plus an E/M service, or two or more proce dures provided by the same physician during a single patient encounter , all of which can be appropriately reported with the existing Current Procedural Terminology (CPT \u00ae) nomenclature. CPT codes create a uniform language for reporting medical services and procedures to allow accurate and efficient claims processing and adjudication. In addition to codes, CPT includes two- digit modifiers, which are appended to codes to indicate that a service or procedure has been altered by a specific circumstance but not c hanged in its definition. While CPT includes several modifiers, the one most commonly reported for multiple services is modifier 25 , which is appended to an E/M service code on a claim to indicate the code is a significant, separately identifiable E/M serv ice by the same physician or other qualified health care professional on the same day of the procedure or other service . Its use allows two E/M services or a procedure plus an E/M service that are distinctly different but required for the patient's conditi on to be appropriately reported and, therefore, appropriately paid. Unfortunately, there is a disconnect between physicians and payers regarding the feasibility of providing, documenting, reporting, and paying for multiple services. T his can be confounded further by use of electronic health records (EHR), which can make it difficult to ensure accurate data if codes and medical terms are not used consistently. Therefore, it becomes imperative that both physicians and payers are well educated on the appropriate way to report multiple services as well as the circumstances that justify such reporting. It is also important that the CPT guidelines used to recognize the validity of claims for multiple services are consistently applied, which may be facilitated by the development of EHR tools.\u00a9 2023 American Medical Association.

REPORT OF THE COUNCIL ON MEDICAL SERV ICE CMS Report 07- A-23 Subject: Reporting Multiple Services Performed During a Single Patient Encounter (Resolution 824 -I-22) Presented by: Lynn Jeffers, MD, MBA, Chair Referred to: Reference Committee A At the November 2022 Interim Meeting, the House of Delegates referred Resolution 824- I-22, 1 which was sponsored by the Private Practice Physician s Section . Resolution 824- I-22 asked the 2 American Medical Association ( AMA ) to recognize that there is greater value to the patient, 3 improved access to care, greater patient satisfaction, and improved overall patient care by 4 advocating for appropriate payment for multiple services (two or more) to be performed during a 5 single patient encounter. Testimony at the November 2022 Interim Meeting reg arding the 6 resolution was mixed, with some speakers offering vignettes to support the need for Resolution 7 824-I-22 and others questioning the need for it given recent revisions to Current Procedural 8 Terminology (CPT \u00ae) Evaluation and Management (E/M) codes that allow physicians to report 9 encounters involving multiple services during a single patient encounter. This report focuses on the 10 need for education of physicians and paye rs on appropriate reporting of multiple services using 11 CPT nomenclature, provides a snapshot of strategies insurers use to deny claims, highlights AMA 12 advocacy efforts and essential policy, and present s new policy recommendations. 13 14 BACKGROUND 15 16 As outlined in Resolution 824- I-22, \" multiple services\" can refer to two E/M services, a procedure 17 plus an E/M service, or two or more procedures provided by the same physician during a single 18 patient encounter. CPT is the most widely accepted US medical nomenclature for reporting 19 singular or multiple medical services and procedures under public and private health insurance 20 programs. In addition to being the code set adopted under the Health Insurance Portability & 21 Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) for outpatient servic es and procedures 1, CPT codes create a 22 uniform language for reporting medical services and procedures to allow accurate and efficient 23 claims processing and adjudication. In addition to codes, CPT includes two- digit modifiers, which 24 are appended to codes t o indicate that a service or procedure has been altered by a specific 25 circumstance but not changed in its definition. The use of modifiers provides supplement ary 26 information for payer policy requirements. 27 28 While CPT provides a valid way to report multiple services, the resulting claims can result in high 29 rates of denials. Payers may flag all multiple services claims for prepayment claim v alidation prior 30 to payment or require submission of documentation with the claim, both of which create 31 unjustifiable administrative burden for physicians , an incumbrance exacerbated in rural 32 communities and other areas with limited health care resources. Addressing rural health inequities 33 is a cornerstone of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) effort to improve health 34 CMS Rep. 07- A-23 -- page 2 of 13 equity,2 a goal that can be achieved by consistent application of CPT across all payers given its 1 ability to promote health equity .3 2 3 Unfortunately, t here is a disconnect between physicians and payers regarding the feasibility of 4 providing, documenting, reporting, and paying for multiple services . This can be confounded 5 further by use of electronic health records (EHR), which can make it difficult to ensure accurate 6 data if codes and medical terms are not used consistently . Therefore, it becomes imperative that 7 both physicians and payers are well educated on the appropriate way to report multiple services as 8 well as the circumstances that justify such reporting. It is also important that the CPT guidelines 9 used to recognize the validity of claims for multiple services are consistently applied, which may 10 be facilitated by the development of EHR tools. 11 12 MODI FIER 25 13 14 CPT m odifier 25 is appended to a n E/M service code on a claim to indicate the code is a 15 significant, separately identifiable E/M service by the same physician or other qualified health care 16 professional on the same day of the procedure or other se rvice.4 Its use allows two E/M services or 17 a procedure plus an E/M service that are distinctly different but required for the patient's condition 18 to be appropriately reported and, therefore, appropriately paid. The CPT Professional Edition also 19 states that a significant, separately identifiable E/M service is defined or substantiated by 20 documentation that satisfies the relevant criteria for the respective E/M service to be reported.5 21 While CPT does not outline required documentation for mod ifier 25, its use indicates that 22 documentation is available in the patient's record to support the reporte d E/M service as distinct 23 and separately identifiable. Further, t he E/M service may be prompted by the symptom or condition 24 for which the procedure an d/or service was provided. As such, different diagnoses are not required 25 for reporting of the E/M services on the same date. 26 27 There are two scenarios where modifier 25 is typically used: 28 29 1) A Preventive Medicine E/M s ervice provided with a problem -oriented O ffice or Other 30 Outpatient E/M service: 31 32 This is a common scenario in pre - or non- verbal patients. For example, a 2 -year-old is seen 33 for their well child visit and the physician finds otitis media during the physical 34 examination. When a significant problem is encountered while performing a Preventive 35 Medicine E/M service, requiring additional work to perform the key components of the E/M 36 service, the appropriate O ffice or Other O utpatient E/M code also should be reported for 37 that service with modifier 25 appended. Modifier 25 allows separate payment for these 38 visits without requiring documentation with the claim form. 39 40 2) A minor surgical procedure provided with a problem -oriented Office or Other Outpatient 41 E/M service : 42 43 CPT codes for minor surgical procedures i nclude preoperative evaluation services (i.e., 44 assessing the site or problem, explaining the procedure, risks, and benefits, and obtaining 45 consent). Therefore, the E/M service has to involve work \"above and beyond\" the 46 preoperative evaluation services. For example, when a patient presents with a head 47 laceration, and the physician also performs a neurological examination before repairing the 48 laceration , the neurological exam would merit a separate E/M service reported with 49 modifier 25. 50 CMS Rep. 07- A-23 -- page 3 of 13 The CPT Professional 2023 c odebook definition of a significant, separately identifiable service 1 relies on satisfying the relevant criteria for determining the correct level of E/M service to be 2 reported. T he following questions can be used to determine whether an E/M service justifies use of 3 modifier 25 according to CPT guidelines : 4 Did the physician perform and document the level of medical decision making or total time 5 necessary to report a problem -oriented Office or Other Outpatient E/M service for the 6 complaint or problem? 7 Could the work to address the complaint or problem stand alone as a billable service? 8 Did the physician perform extra work that went above and beyond the typical pre - or 9 postoperative work associated with the procedure code? 10 11 If all answers are \"yes,\" then use of modifier 25 is consistent with CPT guidelines. 12 13 CMS requires that modifier 25 be used: 14 Only on claims for E/M services and 15 Only when the E/M service is provided by the same physician on the same day as another 16 procedure or service. 17 18 While these two requirements are consistent with CPT guidelines, Medicare policy is more 19 restrictive in that it will not pay for more than one E/M service provided by the same physician on 20 the same day unless the visits are for unrelated problems and could not be provided during the 21 same patient encounter. For example, Medicare will not pay separately when a patient is seen for 22 their annual preventive checkup and the physician finds otitis media during the physical 23 examination - even with the use of modifier 25. However, Medicare will pay for a patient who 24 presents for blood pressure medication evaluation and then returns five hours later that same day 25 for evaluation of leg pain following an accident - if modifier 25 is used. 26 27 Under certain circumstances, Medicare will allow use of modifier 25 when an E/M service is 28 reported with a global procedure. Global procedures include visits and other physician services 29 provided within 24 hours prior to the service, provision of the service, and visits and other 30 physician services for a specified number of days after the service i s provided. 31 32 CMS defines global surgical packages based on the number of postoperative days it assigns to the 33 service : 34 XXX: Global period does not apply 35 0-day global period: Includes procedure and visit on day of procedure 36 10-day global period: Inclu des procedure, visit on day of procedure, and visits 10 days 37 immediately following the day of the procedure 38 90-day global period: Includes procedure, visit on day of procedure, and visits 90 days 39 immediately following the day of the procedure 40 41 Modifier 2 5 may be appended to E/M services reported with minor surgical procedures (i.e., 0- day 42 and 10- day global periods) or procedures not covered by a global period (i.e., XXX). Since minor 43 surgical procedures and XXX -global procedures include pre -service, intra- service, and post -service 44 work inherent in the procedure, the physician cannot report an E/M service for this work in most 45 circumstances when the minor surgical procedure or XXX -global is the primary procedure . 46 Furthermore, Medicare policy prevents the reporting of a separate E/M service for the work 47 associated with the decision to perform a minor surgical procedure. 48 49 All E/M services provided on the same day as a procedure are considered part of the procedure and 50 Medicare only makes separate payment if an exception applies. Modifier 25 is used to provide 51 CMS Rep. 07- A-23 -- page 4 of 13 justification for a visit that is \"generally not payable,\" as Medicare payment is made only if the 1 physician indicates that the service is for a significant, separately identifiable E/M service that is 2 above and beyond the usual pre -service and post -service work required on the day of the 3 procedure. Modifier 25 may be used in the rare circumstance of an E/M service the day before a 4 procedure which represents a significant, separately identifiable service; i t typically is linked to a 5 different diagnosis than the underlying reason for the procedure (e.g., evaluation of a cough that 6 might contraindicate surgery).6 Medicare requires that the physician appropriately and sufficiently 7 document both the medically necessary E/M service and the procedure in the patient's medical 8 record to support the claim for these services, even though the documentation is not required to 9 submit with the claim.7 10 11 CMS has focused on the potential m isuse of modifier 25 since 2005 , when the Office of the 12 Inspector General (OIG) published an analysis indicating that 35 percent of Medicare claims 13 involving modifier 25 did not meet CMS requirements.8 Since that time, both Medicare and private 14 payers have increased their scrutiny of cl aims submitted with modifier 25, which has led to 15 substantial recoupment of physician payments. The OIG continues to maintain modifier 25 as a 16 target of its work plan and is expected to release a report of modifier 25 use in dermatology in late 17 2023. 18 19 OTHE R CPT MODIFIERS USED FOR REPORTING MULTIPLE SERVICES 20 21 In addition to modifier 25, CPT includes other modifiers to allow the reporting of multiple 22 services:9 23 24 Modifier 24: Unrelated E/M service provided by the same physician or other qualified 25 health car e professional during a postoperative period 26 Modifier 51: Multiple procedures , non- E/M procedures provided by the same individual at 27 the same session 28 Modifier 57: Decision for surgery, an E/M service that resulted in the initial decision to 29 perform sur gery 30 Modifier 58: Staged or related procedure or service by the same physician or other 31 qualified health care professional during the postoperative period 32 Modifier 59: Distinct procedural service, an independent non- E/M service performed on 33 the same day Modifier 59 is used to identify non- E/M procedures/services that are not 34 normally reported together but are appropriate under the circumstances. Documentation 35 must support a different session, different procedure or surgery, different site or organ 36 system, separate incision/excision, separate lesion, or separate injury (or area of injury in 37 extensive injuries) not ordinarily encountered or performed on the same day by the same 38 individual . Modifier 59 should only be used if no more descriptive modifier is available, 39 and the use of modifier 59 best explains the circumstances. 40 Modifier 78: Unplanned return to the operating/procedure room by the same physician or 41 other qualified health care professional following initial procedure for a related procedure 42 during the postoperative period 43 Modifier 79: Unrelated procedure or service performed by the same physician or other 44 qualified health care professional during the postoperative period 45 CMS Rep. 07-A-23 -- page 5 of 13 CPT CODES AND GUIDELINES THAT FACILITATE THE REPORTING OF MULTIPLE 1 SERVICES 2 3 Prolonged Service 4 5 There are Prolonged Service CPT codes that permit the reporting of time spent beyond the highest 6 time in the range of total time of the primary E/M service. Prolonged Ser vice CPT codes are 7 reported in 15 minute increments, allowing physicians to be paid for providing extended services 8 during a single patient encounter (even if the time on that date is not continuous ) that contribute 9 toward the total time of the visit. 10 11 The AMA is currently advocating to align CMS's interpretation of the Prolonged Service codes 12 with the CPT definition as described above. Medicare, however, requires that the physician surpass 13 the maximum time of the highest E/M level by 15 minutes. Until such time that CPT and CMS 14 interpretations are reconciled, Medicare requires reporting of Healthcare Common Procedure 15 Coding System Level II codes in lieu of CPT codes for reporting prolonged services. 16 17 Care Management 18 19 Care Management CPT codes are E/M codes reported monthly for physician oversight and 20 management of clinical staff in the development and implementation of the care plan and care 21 coordination in patients with one or more complex chronic conditions. Care Management codes 22 can be reported in addition to other E/M codes (e.g., Office or Other Outpatient Services). Time 23 that is spent providing services within the scope of the Care Management service on the same day 24 as an E/M visit can be counted towards Care Management codes, as long as the time is not counted 25 towards the other reported E/M code(s). 26 27 Total Visit Time Versus Medical Decision Making 28 29 E/M codes are selected based on either the total time spent or medical decision making (MDM) 30 required . The decision of which component to use in selecting the appropriate E/M code is 31 determined by the reporting physician or qualified health care professional based on the available 32 criteria . 33 34 MDM includes establishing diagnoses, assessing the status of a condition, and/or selecting a 35 management option. There are three elements to MDM : 36 Number and complexity of problems addressed at the encounter 37 Amount and/or complexity of data to be reviewed and analyzed 38 Risk of complications and/or morbidity or morta lity of patient management 39 40 Time is based on the total time spent on the date of the encounter. It includes both face- to-face time 41 with the patient and non- face-to-face time spent on things such as care coordination, consulting 42 with other health care profe ssionals, and ordering medications, tests, and procedures. 43 44 Caring for a patient with multiple issues is likely to increase the total time of the encounter, which 45 may allow the physician to report a single, higher level E/M code rather than two lower level E/M 46 codes appended with modifier 25. 47 CMS Rep. 07- A-23 -- page 6 of 13 RESOURCE -BASED RELATIVE VALUE SCALE (RBRVS) 1 2 CMS considers recommendations from the AMA/Specialty Society Relative Value Scale Update 3 Committee (RUC) process to determine relative value units (RVUs) for the RBRVS. The RBRVS 4 is based on the principle that payments for physician services should vary with the resource costs 5 for providing those services and is intended to improve and stabilize the payment system while 6 providing physicians an avenue to continuously improve it. Determining RVUs through the RUC 7 ensures that potential overlap is eliminated from the physician work, practice expense, and 8 professional liability insurance (PLI) for services that are frequently provided together . The 9 physician work component accoun ts for an average of 51 percent of the total RVU for each service 10 while practice expense account s for 45 percent . PLI accounts for the remaining four percent. The 11 factors used to determine physician work include the time it takes to perform the service, the 12 technical skill and physical effort, the required mental effort and judgment , and stress due to the 13 potential risk to the patient. The practice expense components include clinical staff time, medical 14 supplies, and medical equipment. 15 16 The proce ss of valuing CPT codes on the RBRVS contributes to determining whether use of 17 modifier 25 is warranted. Global procedure CPT codes are valued to include pre- service (e.g., 18 evaluation time, patient positioning, scrub /dress/wait time), intra -service ( e.g., performing the 19 procedure , also known as \"skin- to-skin\" time ), and post -service (e.g., patient stabilization, 20 communicating with the patient and other professionals) work. 21 22 For example, Medicare payment for CPT code 64635 ( Destruction by neurolytic agent, 23 imaging guidance (fluoroscopy or CT); lumbar or sacral, 24 single facet joint), includes 28 minutes pre -service time. Reporting a problem -oriented Office or 25 Other Outpatient E/M code in addition to CPT code 64635 when e valuation is limited to assessing 26 the specific problem is essentially double billing for the pre -service evaluation. Therefore, use of 27 modifier 25 would not be appropriate in this situation. 28 29 However, when a patient presents for their annual skin examination and a suspicious lesion is 30 discovered, it is appropriate for the physician to proceed with a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure 31 at the same visit after obtaining the patient's medical history, completing a review of systems, and 32 conducting a c linical examination. This situation would warrant the use of modifier 25. The ability 33 to assess and intervene during the same visit is optimal for patients who subsequently may require 34 fewer follow -up visits and experience more immediate relief from their symptoms. 35 36 MULTIPLE PROCEDURE PAYMENT REDUCTIONS 37 38 In addition to two E/M services or a procedure plus an E/M service, \"multiple services\" can refer to 39 two or more procedures provided by the same physician during a single patient encounter. Payers 40 may utilize the CMS Multiple Procedure Payment Reduction (MPPR) policy to adjudica te claims 41 involving more than one procedure. 42 43 Under the MPPR, Medicare makes full payment for the professional component ( PC) and technical 44 component (TC) of the highest priced procedure . Payment is made at 95 percent for subsequent PC 45 services furnished by the same physician to the same patient in the same session on the same day. 46 Payment is made at 50 percent for subsequent TC services furnished by the same physician to the 47 same patient in the same session on the same day.10 48 49 The rationale behind CMS ' MPPR policy is similar to that of its global surgical package definitions 50 in that \"most medical and surgical procedures include pre- procedure, intra -procedure, and post - 51 CMS Rep. 07-A-23 -- page 7 of 13 procedure w ork. When multiple procedures are performed at the same patient encounter, there is 1 often overlap of the pre-procedure and post- procedure work. Payment methodologies for surgical 2 procedures account for the overlap of the pre-procedure and post-procedure wo rk.\"11 3 4 CLAIMS ADJUDICATION AND COMPLIANCE 5 6 Policies on payment for multiple services during a single patient encounter are typically 7 communicated via claims adjudication with the use of coding edits. Most private payers utilize 8 customizable, propriety claims edit systems, while Medicare and Medicaid use the coordinated 9 National Correct Coding Initiative (NCCI). 10 11 NCCI reinforces Medicare policies, and since it is common for private payers to adopt NCCI as 12 part of their customizable claims editing systems, a llowing physicians the opportunity to comment 13 on NCCI takes on increased importance. Through a process coordinated by CMS and the AMA, 14 national medical specialty societies are able to review and comment on proposed NCCI updates on 15 a quarterly basis. In rec ent years, however, the NCCI review process has become less transparent 16 and the AMA has continued to advocate toward a return to the \"solid, transparent, collaborative 17 track among all parties (CMS, AMA and specialty societies) that has been so beneficial i n the 18 past.\" ( June 2021 letter , November 2021 letter ) 19 20 Edits on code pairs may be overridden by appending the appropriate modifier on one of the codes. 21 For example, NCCI includes an edit on the codes for vision screening (CPT code 99173) and a 22 level 3 established patient Office or Other Outpatient visit (CPT code 99213) - but allows override 23 of the edit with use of the appropriate modifier (i.e., modifier 25 appended to 99213). Payers' 24 increased use of claims edits has resulted in a commensurate increase in physicians' use of 25 modifiers in an effort to override restrictive payment polices. However, that strategy may backfire 26 as some payers' code auditing processes will flag all claims billed with modifier 25 for prepayment 27 claim validation prior to payment. Once a claim is validated, it is either released for payment or 28 denied for incorrect use of the modifier. A significant, separately identifiable E/M service is 29 defined or substantiated by documentation that satisfies the relevant criteria for the respective E/M 30 service to be reported. If claim history or assigned diagnosis codes do not indicate tha t significant, 31 separately identifiable services were performed, payers typically cover the primary procedure or 32 other service and deny the secondary E/M billed with modifier 25. 33 34 Some payers have instituted policies where use of modifier 25 triggers an aut omatic reduction in 35 payment for the second code to account for what they perceive to be \"overlap\" between the two 36 codes (e.g., a Preventive Medicine Service E/M code reported with an Office or Other Outpatient 37 Service E/M code appended with modifier 25 all ows payment of the Preventive Medicine Service 38 code at 100 percent and the Office or Other Outpatient code at 50 percent). While the work 39 associated with performing the history, physical examination, and MDM for the problem -oriented 40 E/M service may include some overlap with those performed as part of the comprehensive 41 preventive medicine E/M service, the physician's use of modifier 25 signals that they performed a 42 significant, separately identifiable problem- oriented E/M service. An insignificant or trivial 43 problem or abnormality is not reported separately from the preventive medicine E/M service. 44 45 Reporting both preventive and problem -oriented E/M services during a single patient encounter can 46 produce inconsistent results in terms of claims payment across payers. While some payers will pay 47 the full allowable amount for both the problem- oriented E/M code and the preventive medicine 48 services E/M code, some will assess a co -pay for each service, some will carve out the payment for 49 the problem -oriented E/M servi ce from the payment for the preventive medicine E/M service 50 (which results in a total charge that does not exceed that of a comprehensive preventive 51 CMS Rep. 07- A-23 -- page 8 of 13 examination alone), and some will reject the claim on the basis that they do not accept coding for 1 both a preventive and problem -oriented service on the same date regardless of the amount of the 2 charge due to the perception of overlap between the two services. In response, physicians may 3 decide to report only one of the services , depending on which of the two is the primary focus of the 4 visit and require s the most amount of physician time and work ; however, this is not a tenable 5 solution as it fails to recognize the value of services provided. A lternatively, the physician may ask 6 the patient to return for another visit to address the management of the problem or the preventive 7 care; however, many physicians are hesitant to do this as it places significant burden on patients, 8 particularly those wi th limited resources , and may risk deterioration of the patient's condition until 9 another appointment can be scheduled. 10 11 Certain p ayers have considered requiring documentation for all modifier 25 claims . Most recently , 12 Cigna proposed a policy requiring pra ctices to send documentation with \"a cover sheet indicating 13 the office notes support the use of modifier 25 appended to the E/M code.\"12 While advocacy by 14 the California Medical Association and the AMA was initially able to delay implementation , Cigna 15 has re-released the policy, which was scheduled to become effective in May 2023. At the time this 16 report was written, t he AMA w as prepar ing a sign -on letter to allow state medical associations and 17 national medical specialty societies to join in opposition against Cigna's policy. Previous AMA 18 advocacy efforts opposing proposed modifier 25 payment reductions by Anthem (November 2017) 19 and UnitedHealthcare (July 2018) have proven successful. 20 21 Misunderstanding and/or misuse of modifier 25 has made it a top billing compliance risk area . It 22 has been the focus several False Claims Act and civil monetary penalty settlements ,13 as well as 23 CMS comparative billing reports (CBR). The CMS CBR program is an educational tool intended to 24 encourage accurate reporting and support physicians' internal compliance activities. A CBR tracks 25 a given physician's billing patterns as compared to their peers' patterns within a Medicare service 26 area. Since CBRs are priva te and shared only with the physician, CMS is able to maintain that 27 \"receiving a CBR is not an indication of or precursor to an audit, and it requires no response on a 28 provider's part.\"14 29 30 Compliance is impacted by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act 31 of 2003 (MMA) , which only allows extrapolation of overpayments based on statistical sampling 32 when there's \"a determination of sustained or high level of payment error, or documentation that 33 educational intervention has failed to correct the payment error.\"15 If an audit does not use a 34 random sample of claims , MMA dictates that extrapolation of that sample invalidates any claim of 35 overpayment . 36 37 AMA POLICY 38 39 The AMA has robust policy to gui de advocacy for appropriate payment for multiple services 40 performed during a single patient encounter. 41 42 Among the most relevant policies are those that: 43 Focus on recognition of modifier 25 by: 44 Advocating for the acceptance of CPT modifiers, particularly mo difier 25, and the 45 appropriate alteration of payment based on CPT modifiers (Policy D -70.971); 46 Aggressively and immediately advocating through any legal means possible to ensure 47 that when an E/M code is reported with modifier 25, that both the procedure an d E/M 48 codes are paid at the non- reduced, allowable payment rate (Policy D -385.956); 49 CMS Rep. 07- A-23 -- page 9 of 13 Supporting insurance company payment for E/M services and procedures performed 1 on the same day (Policy H -385.944); and 2 Advocating that a CPT code representing a service or procedure that is covered and 3 paid for separately should also be paid for when performed at the same time as another 4 service or procedure (Policy D -70.959). 5 6 Preserve discrete E/M code levels by: 7 Communicating to CMS and private payers that the current levels of E/M services 8 should be maintained and not compressed, with appropriate payment for each level 9 (Policy D -70.979) and 10 Opposing any health insurance code collapsing policies that result in unfair payment 11 practices (Policy H -70.995). 12 13 Combat bundling an d downcoding by: 14 Opposing the bundling of procedure and laboratory services within the E/M services 15 (Policy H -70.985); 16 Opposing the use of time elements to deny or downgrade services submitted based on a 17 cumulative time (Policy H -70.976); 18 Advocating to ensure that public and private payers do not bundle services 19 inappropriately by encompassing individually coded services under other separately 20 coded services (Policy H -70.949); 21 Vigorously opposing the practice of unilateral, arbitrary recoding and/or bundling by 22 all payers (Policy H -70.937); 23 Introducing or supporting legislation that would require managed care plans to be 24 monitored and prohibited from the arbitrary and inappropriate bundling of services to 25 reduce payment (Poli cy H -70.962); and 26 Working with CMS to provide physician expertise commenting on the medical 27 appropriateness of code bundling initiatives for Medicare payment policies (Policy 28 H-70.980). 29 30 AMA policy targets payer policies that deviate from CPT guidelines, such as those that: 31 Oppose inappropriate bundling of medical services by third party payers (Policy 32 D-70.983); 33 Support the recognition and payment for all CPT codes by all third party payers (Policy 34 H-70.974); 35 Seek legislation and/or regulation to ensure that all insurance companies and group payers 36 recognize all published CPT codes including modifiers (Policy H -70.954); 37 Intensify efforts to ensure uniform application of coding principles (Policy H -70.986); 38 Assure that CMS and local carriers appropriately reimburse all E/M services (Policy 39 H-385.952); 40 Develop national (state) standards and model legislation that require full disclosure in plain 41 English of multiple procedure reimbursement policies (Policy H -285.946); 42 Step up ongoing review of the proper us e of CPT codes in medical billing claims payments 43 by the US Health Insurance Industry (Policy D -385.949); 44 Support the elimination of Medicare arbitrary visit frequency parameters (Policy H -280- 45 974); and 46 Pursue proper use of CPT codes, guidelines, and modif iers by software claims editing 47 vendors and their customers (Policy H -70.927). 48 CMS Rep. 07- A-23 -- page 10 of 13 Given that CPT is copyrighted by the AMA, there are many policies that support the development, 1 updating, and maintenance of clinically valid codes in order to accurately refle ct current clinical 2 practice and innovation in medicine, including those that: 3 Work with CMS to continue to refine E/M coding (Policy H -70.961); 4 Advocate that the Department of Health and Human Services designate CPT guidelines 5 and instructions as contained in the CPT code book and approved by the CPT Editorial 6 Panel as the national implementation standards for CPT codes (Policy D -70.987); and 7 Limit future efforts to substantially revise E/M codes to the CPT Editorial Panel (Policy 8 H-70.921) to appropriately allow the accurate reporting of E/M services provided by all 9 physicians (Policy H -70.982). 10 11 AMA policy advocates that payer policies must align with CPT guidelines and reduce the burden 12 of documentation for E/M services (Policy H -70.952), including opposition to the requirement that 13 all Level 4 or Level 5 E/M codes require submission of medical record documentation (Policy 14 D-70.991). Furthermore , AMA policy indicates that payer audit tools must be based on the factors 15 for arriving at complexity as defined in the CPT code book (Policy H -70.918). 16 17 The AMA is invested in ensuring that CPT codes are appropriately valued on the RBRVS via the 18 RUC proces s. AMA policy advocates that annually updated and rigorously validated RBRVS 19 values should provide a basis for physician payment schedules, opposes CMS' policy that reduces 20 payment for additional surgical procedures after the first procedure by more than 50 percent, and 21 encourages third party payers and other public programs to utilize the most current CPT codes, 22 modifiers, and RBRVS relative values (Policy D -400.999). CMS is urged to adopt RUC 23 recommendations for new and revised CPT codes (Policy H -400.969). 24 25 AMA policy supports development of CPT educational programs for physicians and health 26 insurance carriers (Policy H -70.993) and working with national medical specialty societies to 27 educate their members concerning CPT coding issues (Policy H -70.973). Po licy H -400.972 states 28 that the AMA will take all necessary legal, legislative, and other action to assure that all modifiers 29 are well publicized and include adequate descriptors. 30 31 In addition to advocating for compliance with CPT modifier 25 guidelines, AM A policy has 32 addressed other relevant issues: 33 Recognition of modifiers 54, 55, and 56 for postoperative care of surgical patients (Policy 34 D-70.955) and modifier 26 to report the professional component separate from the 35 technical component for the interpre tation of laboratory tests (Policy D -70.957); 36 Appropriate payment for office -based procedures (Policy H -330.925), emergency care 37 (Policy H -130.978), telephone consultations (Policy H -390.889), counseling of serious 38 medical problems (Policy H -385.977), diagnostic and laboratory panel tests (Policy H - 39 390.923 and Policy H -70.950), vaccine administration (Policy D -440.937), consultations 40 (Policy D -70.953 and Policy H -70.939), care plan oversight services (Policy H -70.960), 41 and after hours services (Policy H -385.940); 42 Delineation of the physician role and responsibility in supervising patient care in non- 43 office ambulatory settings, including fair and equitable payment for those services (Policy 44 H-70.991); 45 Insurer recognition of CPT codes that allow primary care physicians to report and receive 46 payment for physical and behavioral health care services provided on the same date of 47 service (Policy H -385.915); 48 CMS Rep. 07- A-23 -- page 11 of 13 Development of coding for non- physician services (Policy H -70.994); and 1 Appropriate payment for the additiona l work and expenses required in treating patients 2 during the COVID -19 pandemic (Policy D -390.947). 3 4 DISCUSSION 5 6 There is currently robust infrastructure to allow the reporting of multiple services during a single 7 patient encounter . However, there may be a need to ensure that key stakeholders are well educated 8 on the various reporting options. It is essential that both physicians and payers understand the 9 nuance d concepts involved, such as existing CPT nomenclature , how the RUC process eliminates 10 overlap of physician work and practice expense between services and procedures , and how 11 appropriate reporting and payment for multiple services can lead to greater value to the patient, 12 improved access to care, increased patient satisfaction, and improved overall pat ient care. 13 14 With the ongoing development of coding resources, it is imperative that CMS align with CPT 15 guidelines in order to reduce potential confusion. For example, CPT and CMS do not presently 16 agree on the interpretation of the Prolonged Service CPT codes , which ha ve a direct bearing on 17 physicians' ability to accurately report multiple services during a single patient encounter. This has 18 resulted in many payers challenging physicians' use of the Prolonged Service codes or denying 19 them all together. As such, the AMA is strongly advocating for alignment of CMS's interpretation 20 of the Prolonged Service codes with the CPT definition . This approach is consistent with past 21 AMA advocacy initiatives , most of which have been successful in reducing the gaps between CMS 22 and CPT. 23 24 A comprehensive education on the appropriate reporting of multiple services should start early in 25 physicians' careers, possibly during residency. A curriculum could focus on concepts such as how 26 to use total visit time to report a higher -level E/M service rather than two E/M codes plus modifier 27 25, allowing them to bypass the administrative rigor imposed by payers who routinely flag 28 modifier 25 claims . It would be ideal if a similar curr iculum could be shared with , and undertaken 29 by, the payer community, possibly through organizations such as America's Health Insurance 30 Plans. With these potential resolutions , both \"sides\" would be cognizant of the guidelines, fostering 31 full transparency b etween claims submission and claims adjudication. 32 33 As of 2021, 78 percent of office -based physicians used certified EHR systems.16 Most EHRs 34 include software tools to help physicians determine the appropriate E/M codes for patient 35 encounters and when used correctly, they support accurate coding . However, the se EHR -based 36 computer -assisted E/M coding (CAEMC) tools are generally associated with higher levels of E/M 37 coding due to factors such as \"cloning\" of documentation from the previous visit , which may 38 contribute to restrictive payer policies that require burdensome documentation in order to justify 39 payment . OIG is concerned about EHRs \"aiding\" providers with coding and documentation 40 decisions, but there has been limited testing of how EHRs ca pture and use information to 41 recommend E/M codes. 42 43 EHR CAEMC tools are limited in their ability to assist physicians in documenting and reporting 44 multiple services. As such, it may be beneficial for EHR CAEMC tools to be developed to 45 facilitate the appropr iate reporting of modifier 25. Such tools might include an algorithm to 46 ascertain the potential areas of perceived overlap between two services, which could then be 47 synchronized to the documentation provided for each service. 48 CMS Rep. 07- A-23 -- page 12 of 13 RECOMMENDATIONS 1 2 The Council on Medical Service recommends that the following be adopted in lieu of Resolution 3 824-I-22, and the remainder of the report be filed: 4 1. That our American Medical Association (AMA) support mechanisms to report modifiers 5 appropriately with the least administrative burden possible, including the development of 6 electronic health record tools to facilitate the reporting of multiple , medically necessary 7 services supported by modifier 25. ( New HOD Policy ) 8 9 2. That our AMA support comprehensive education for physicians and insurers on the 10 appropriate use of modifier 25. (New HOD Policy) 11 12 3. That our AMA reaffirm Policy D -70.971, which advocates for the acceptance of Current 13 Procedural Technology ( CPT\u00ae) modifiers, particularly modifier 25, and the appropriate 14 alteration of payment based on CPT modifiers. (Reaffirm HOD Policy) 15 16 4. That our AMA reaffirm Policy D -385.956, which directs the AMA to aggressively and 17 immediately advocate through any legal means possi ble to ensure that when an evaluation 18 and management (E/M) code is reported with modifier 25, that both the procedure and E/M 19 codes are paid at the non- reduced, allowable payment rate. (Reaffirm HOD Policy) 20 21 5. That our AMA reaffirm Policy H -385.944, which su pports insurance company payment for 22 E/M services and procedures performed on the same day . (Reaffirm HOD Policy) 23 24 6. That our AMA reaffirm Policy D -70.959, which advocates that a CPT code representing a 25 service or procedure that is covered and paid for separately should also be paid for when 26 performed at the same time as another service or procedure.

D -330.960 RELEVANT AMA POLICY Cuts in Medicare Outpatient Infusion Services D -330.960 1. Our AMA will actively support efforts to seek legislation to ensure that Medicare payments for drugs fully cover the physician's acquisition, inventory and carrying cost and that Medicare payments for drug administration and related services are adequate to ensure continued patient access to outpatien t infusion services. 2. Our AMA will continue strong advocacy efforts working with relevant national medical specialty societies to ensure adequate physician payment for Part B drugs and patient access to biologic and pharmacologic agents. Citation: Res. 926, I -03; Reaffirmed and Modified: CMS Rep. 3, I -08; Reaffirmation A -15; Reaffirmed: CMS Rep. 10, A -16; Reaffirmation: I -18; Opposition to the CMS Medicare Part B Drug Payment Model D -330.904 1. Our AMA will request that the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) withdraw the proposed Part B Drug Payment Model. 2. Our AMA will support and actively work to advance Congressional action to block the proposed Part B Drug Payment Model if CMS proceeds with the proposal. 3. Our AMA will advocate against policies that are likely to undermine access to the best course of treatment for individual patients and oppose demonstration programs that could lead to lower quality of care and do not contain mechanisms for safeguarding patients. Resolution: 102 (A-23) Page 3 of 3 4. Our AMA will advocate for ensuring that CMS solicits and takes into consideration feedback from patients, physicians, advocates, or other stakeholders in a way that allows for meaningful input on any Medicare coverage or reimbursement policy that impacts patient access to medical therapies, including policies on coverage and reimbursement. Citation: Res. 241, A -16; Medicare Part B Competitive Acquisition Program (CAP) H -110.983 Our AMA will advocate that any revised Medicare Part B Competitive Acquisition Program meet the following standards to improve the value of the program by lowering the cost of drugs without undermining quality of care: (1) it must be genuinely voluntary and not penalize practices that choose not to participate; (2) it should provide supplemental payments to reimburse for costs associated with special handling and storage for Part B drugs; (3) it must not reduce reimbursement for services related to provision/administration of Part B drugs, and reimbursement should be indexed to an appropriat e healthcare inflation rate; (4) it should permit flexibility such as allowing for variation in orders that may occur on the day of treatment, and allow for the use of CAP -acquired drugs at multiple office locations; (5) it should allow practices to choose from multiple vendors to ensure competition, and should also ensure that vendors meet appropriate safety and quality standards; (6) it should include robust and comprehensive patient protections which include preventing delays in treatment, helping patien ts find assistance or alternative payment arrangements if they cannot meet the cost-sharing responsibility, and vendors should bear the risk of non- payment of patient copayments in a way that does not penalize the physician; (7) it should not allow vendors to restrict patient access using utilization management policies such as step therapy; and (8) it should not force disruption of current systems which have evolved to ensure patient access to necessary medications. Citation: Res. 216, I -18; Reaffirmed: CM S Rep. 4, I -19; Reaffirmed: CMS Rep. 4, A -22; AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 103 (A-23) Introduced by: Medical Student Section Subject: Movement Away from Employer -Sponsored Health Insurance Referred to: Reference Committee A Whereas, More than 50% of Americans rely on employer -sponsored health insurance (ESHI), 1 which was first offered as a benefit to attract workers during the wage freeze of WWII1,2; and 2 3 Whereas, With health insurance linked to employment, job loss can decrease access to 4 healthcare, including important preventative services and chronic disease management3,4; and 5 6 Whereas, Economic downturns due to global recessions or pandemics can result in millions of 7 people losing their employer -sponsored health insurance, including an estimated 7 million 8 individuals who have lost ESHI due to the COVID -19 pandemic and associated recession5-11; 9 and 10 11 Whereas, Due to variation in insurer networks, patients who switch jobs and as a result change 12 their health insurance may have to change doctors, creating a barrier to continuity of care12,13; 13 and 14 15 Whereas, In 2019, 36% of employers offered only a single health insurance plan and an 16 additional 40% of employers offered only two plans, decreasing patient choice and preventing 17 the functioning of a free market14-16; and 18 19 Whereas, By linking health insurance to employment, employer -sponsored health insurance 20 creates job lock and decreases entrepreneurship17,18; and 21 22 Whereas, A 2016 study in the Journal of Economic Perspectives found that people in the 23 bottom fifth of family income receive annual benefits of less than $500, while those in the top 24 fifth receive benefits averaging $4,500, demonstrating that employer -sponsored health 25 insurance tax deduction disproportionately benefits the wealthy19; and 26 27 Whereas, Self -insurance refers to the practice wherein employers collect premiums from 28 employees and pay for healthcare benefits for plan beneficiaries directly, with or without the 29 assistance of third party administrators who may negotiate networks, process claims, and 30 provide other services20,21; and 31 32 Whereas, Because of financial and legal incentives that favor the practice, between 75-80% of 33 employers self -insure, meaning that many firms become de facto health insurance companies in 34 addition to the main business activities they are engaged in22,23; and 35 36 Whereas, Self -insured plans have proven incapable of controlling healthcare costs, with one 37 RAND study focusing on predominantly self -insured employer plans showing that hospital costs 38 increased from 236% of Medicare rates to 241% of Medicare rates in the two year period from 39 2015- 201723,24; and 40 Resolution: 103 (A-23) Page 2 of 11 Whereas, The administrative costs of private, employer -based plans far exceed the 1 administrative costs of public plans in the United States and insurance systems in other 2 industrialized peer nations25-29; and 3 4 Whereas, The excessively fragmented nature of the employer -sponsored health insurance 5 market in the United States is a significant contributor to the higher costs of medical goods and 6 services in the United States relative to other countries29-31; and 7 8 Whereas, Multiple different models exist for the provision of health insurance coverage, 9 including systems based wholly on individually owned private insurance plans, the Bismarckian 10 model wherein payroll taxes are used to fund competing nonprofit insurance providers, and the 11 national health insurance model wherein government insurance plans funded by taxes contract 12 with privately owned healthcare providers32,33; and 13 14 Whereas, All of the assorted health insurance systems employed in other industrialized 15 countries outperform the ESHI -based American insurance system on key metrics such as health 16 outcomes, cost, and administrative efficiency29,30,34 -36; and 17 18 Whereas, Under the Affordable Care Act, patients who are offered an \"affordable\" ESHI plan 19 that meets the minimum value standard are ineligible to receive premium tax credits and cost 20 sharing reductions (a requirement known as the \"ESHI firewall\"), thus significantly impairing 21 their ability to buy a plan on the ACA's Health Insurance Marketplaces at an affordable rate37; 22 and 23 24 Whereas, An ESHI plans needs to cover only 60% of the total cost of expected healthcare 25 expenses to meet the minimum value standard, leaving up to 40% of these costs to be covered 26 by the patient37; and 27 28 Whereas, A survey of employer -sponsored health insurance beneficiaries conducted by the 29 Kaiser Family Foundation in 2019 found that over 40% of beneficiaries had difficulty paying for 30 some aspect of their coverage, including the premium, deductibles, or other expenditures38; and 31 32 Whereas, Under current law, the cost of individual ESHI coverage is exclusively used to 33 calculate plan affordability even if the employee wants to or needs to purchase a family plan, 34 meaning that millions of Americans are ineligible for premium tax credits but may also be unable 35 to afford a plan through their employe r39-42; and 36 37 Whereas, Eliminating the ESHI firewall would allow individuals who are offered ESHI to still be 38 eligible for premium tax credits and cost sharing reductions, thus enabling them to choose a 39 plan that is the most affordable and best meets their needs from either their employer - 40 sponsored plans or other plans offered on their state's Health Insurance Marketplace43,44; and 41 42 Whereas, Roughly 10 -20 million Americans with ESHI could choose a plan on the ACA 43 Exchanges with lower premiums than their current employer -based plan if the ESHI firewall 44 were eliminated44,45; and 45 46 Whereas, In 2017, 2.7 million uninsured Americans who otherwise would be eligible for 47 premium tax credits to lower the cost of insurance coverage were ineligible for those tax credits 48 because of an offer of ESHI46; and 49 Resolution: 103 (A-23) Page 3 of 11 Whereas, Removing the ESHI firewall could contribute to substantial insurance coverage gains 1 by making insurance options on the ACA Exchanges significantly more affordable for individuals 2 who may not be able to afford insurance offered through their employer47-50; and 3 4 Whereas, The American Medical Association \"supports individually selected and individually - 5 owned health insurance as the preferred method for people to obtain health insurance 6 coverage\" (Policy H -165.920), but has not recognized the deficiencies of the employer - 7 sponsored insurance system, nor the need to move towards a health insurance system that 8 does not rely on employer -sponsored insurance; therefore be it 9 10 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association recognize the inefficiencies and 11 complexity of the employer -sponsored health insurance system and the existence of alternative 12 models that better align incentives to facilitate access to high quality healthcare ( New HOD 13 Policy) ; and be it further 14 15 RESOLVED, That our AMA support movement toward a healthcare system that does not rely 16 on employer -sponsored health insurance and enables universal access to high quality 17 healthcare (New HOD Policy) ; and be it further 18 19 RESOLVED, That our AMA amend Polic y H-165.828, \"Health Insurance Affordability\", by 20 addition and deletion to read as follows: 21 22 HEALTH INSURANCE AFFORDABILITY, H- 165.828 23 1. Our AMA supports modifying the eligibility criteria for premium 24 credits and cost -sharing subsidies for those offered employer - 25 sponsored coverage by lowering the threshold that determines 26 whether an employee's premium contribution is affordable to that 27 which applies to the exemption from the individual mandate of the 28 Affordable Care Act (ACA).Our AMA advocates for the elimination of 29 the employer -sponsored insurance firewall such that no individual 30 would be ineligible for premium tax credits and cost -sharing 31 assistance for marketplace coverage solely on the basis of having 32 access to employer -sponsored health insurance. 33 2. Ou r AMA supports legislation or regulation, whichever is relevant, 34 to fix the ACA's \"family glitch,\" thus determining the affordability of 35 employer -sponsored coverage with respect to the cost of family - 36 based or employee -only coverage. 37 3. Our AMA encourages t he development of demonstration projects 38 to allow individuals eligible for cost -sharing subsidies, who forego 39 these subsidies by enrolling in a bronze plan, to have access to a 40 health savings account (HSA) partially funded by an amount 41 determined to be equivalent to the cost- sharing subsidy. 42 4. Our AMA supports capping the tax exclusion for employment - 43 based health insurance as a funding stream to improve health 44 insurance affordability, including for individuals impacted by the 45 inconsistency in affordability definitions, individuals impacted by the 46 \"family glitch,\" and individuals who forego cost -sharing subsidies 47 despite being eligible. 48 5. Our AMA supports additional education regarding deductibles and 49 cost- sharing at the time of health plan enrollment, including through 50 the use of online prompts and the provision of examples of patient 51 cost- sharing responsibilities for common procedures and services. 52 Resolution: 103 (A-23) Page 4 of 11 6. Our AMA supports efforts to ensure clear and meaningful 1 differences between plans offered on health insurance exchanges. 2 7. Our AMA supports clear labeling of exchange plans that are 3 eligible to be paired with a Health Savings Account (HSA) with 4 information on how to set up an HSA. 5 8. Our AMA supports the inclusion of pregnancy as a qualifying life 6 event for s pecial enrollment in the health insurance marketplace. 7 (Modify Current HOD Policy) and be it further 8 9 RESOLVED, That our AMA amend Policy H -165.823, \"Options to Maximize Coverage under the 10 AMA Proposal for Reform\", by deletion to read as follows: 11 12 OPTIONS TO MAXIMIZE COVERAGE UNDER THE AMA 13 PROPOSAL FOR REFORM, H -165.823 14 1. That our AMA advocate for a pluralistic health care system, which 15 may include a public option, that focuses on increasing equity and 16 access, is cost -conscious, and reduces burden on physi cians. 17 2. Our AMA will advocate that any public option to expand health 18 insurance coverage must meet the following standards: 19 a. The primary goals of establishing a public option are to maximize 20 patient choice of health plan and maximize health plan marketplace 21 competition. 22 b. Eligibility for premium tax credit and cost -sharing assistance to 23 purchase the public option is restricted to individuals without access 24 to affordable employer -sponsored coverage that meets standards for 25 minimum value of benefits. 26 bc. Physician payments under the public option are established 27 through meaningful negotiations and contracts. Physician payments 28 under the public option must be higher than prevailing Medicare 29 rates and at rates sufficient to sustain the costs of medical practice. 30 cd. Physicians have the freedom to choose whether to participate in 31 the public option. Public option proposals should not require provider 32 participation and/or tie physician participation in Medicare, Medicaid 33 and/or any commercial product to participation in the public option. 34 de. The public option is financially self -sustaining and has uniform 35 solvency requirements. 36 ef. The public option does not receive advantageous government 37 subsidies in comparison to those provided to other health plans. 38 fg. The public option shall be made available to uninsured individuals 39 who fall into the \"coverage gap\" in states that do not expand 40 Medicaid - having incomes above Medicaid eligibility limits but below 41 the federal poverty level, which is the lower limit for premium tax 42 credits - at no or nominal cost. 43 3. Our AMA supports states and/or the federal government pursuing 44 auto- enrollment in health insurance coverage that meets the 45 following standards: 46 a. Individuals must provide consent to the applicable state and/or 47 federal entities to share their health insurance status and tax data 48 with the entity with the authority to make coverage determinations. 49 b. Individuals should only be auto- enrolled in health insurance 50 coverage if they are eligible for coverage options that would be of no 51 cost to them after the application of any subsidies. Candidates for 52 Resolution: 103 (A-23) Page 5 of 11 auto- enrollment would, therefore, include individuals eligible for 1 Medicaid/Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) or zero- 2 premium marketplace coverage. 3 c. Individuals should have the opportunity to opt out from health 4 insurance coverage into which they are auto- enrolled. 5 d. Individuals should not be penalized if they are auto- enrolled into 6 coverage for which they are not eligible or remain uninsured despite 7 believing they were enrolled in health insurance coverage via auto - 8 enrollment. 9 e. Individuals eligible for zero- premium marketplace cov erage should 10 be randomly assigned among the zero- premium plans with the 11 highest actuarial values. 12 f. Health plans should be incentivized to offer pre- deductible 13 coverage including physician services in their bronze and silver 14 plans, to maximize the value of zero -premium plans to plan 15 enrollees. 16 g. Individuals enrolled in a zero -premium bronze plan who are 17 eligible for cost -sharing reductions should be notified of the cost - 18 sharing advantages of enrolling in silver plans. 19 h. There should be targeted outreach and streamlined enrollment 20 mechanisms promoting health insurance enrollment, which could 21 include raising awareness of the availability of premium tax credits 22 and cost -sharing reductions, and establishing a special enrollment 23 period. 24 4. Our AMA: (a) will ad vocate that any federal approach to cover 25 uninsured individuals who fall into the \"coverage gap\" in states that 26 do not expand Medicaid-- having incomes above Medicaid eligibility 27 limits but below the federal poverty level, which is the lower limit for 28 premi um tax credit eligibility --make health insurance coverage 29 available to uninsured individuals who fall into the coverage gap at 30 no or nominal cost, with significant cost -sharing protections; (b) will 31 advocate that any federal approach to cover uninsured individuals 32 who fall into the coverage gap provide states that have already 33 implemented Medicaid expansions with additional incentives to 34 maintain their expansions ; (c) supports extending eligibility to 35 purchase Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace coverage to 36 undocumented immigrants and Deferred Action for Childhood 37 Arrivals (DACA) recipients, with the guarantee that health plans and 38 ACA marketplaces will not collect and/or report data regarding 39 enrollee immigration status; and (d) recognizes the potential for state 40 and local initiatives to provide coverage to immigrants without regard 41 to immigration status.

RELEVANT AMA POLICY Individual Health Insurance H -165.920 Our AMA: (1) affirms its support for pluralism of health care delivery systems and financing mechanisms in obtaining universal coverage and access to health care services; (2) recognizes incremental levels of coverage for different groups of the uninsured, consistent with finite Resolution: 103 (A-23) Page 8 of 11 resources, as a necessary interim step toward universal access; (3) actively supports the principle of the individual's right to select his/her health insurance plan and actively support ways in which the concept of individually selected and individually owned health insurance can be appropriately integrated, in a complementary position, into the Association's position on achieving universal coverage and access to health care services. To do this, our AMA will: (a) Continue to support equal tax treatment for payment of health insurance coverage whether the employer provides the coverage for the employee or whether the employer provides a financial contribution to the employee to purchase individually selected and i ndividually owned health insurance coverage, including the exemption of both employer and employee contributions toward the individually owned insurance from FICA (Social Security and Medicare) and federal and state unemployment taxes; (b) Support the conc ept that the tax treatment would be the same as long as the employer's contribution toward the cost of the employee's health insurance is at least equivalent to the same dollar amount that the employer would pay when purchasing the employee's insurance dir ectly; (c) Study the viability of provisions that would allow individual employees to opt out of group plans without jeopardizing the ability of the group to continue their employer sponsored group coverage; and (d) Work toward establishment of safeguards, such as a health care voucher system, to ensure that to the extent that employer direct contributions made to the employee for the purchase of individually selected and individually owned health insurance coverage continue, such contributions are used onl y for that purpose when the employer direct contributions are less than the cost of the specified minimum level of coverage. Any excess of the direct contribution over the cost of such coverage could be used by the individual for other purposes; (4) will i dentify any further means through which universal coverage and access can be achieved; (5) supports individually selected and individually -owned health insurance as the preferred method for people to obtain health insurance coverage; and supports and advoc ates a system where individually - purchased and owned health insurance coverage is the preferred option, but employer -provided coverage is still available to the extent the market demands it; (6) supports the individual's right to select his/her health insurance plan and to receive the same tax treatment for individually purchased coverage, for contributions toward employer -provided coverage, and for completely employer provided coverage; (7) supports immediate tax equity for health insurance costs of self -employed and unemployed persons; (8) supports legislation to remove paragraph (4) of Section 162(l) of the US tax code, which discriminates against the self -employed by requiring them to pay federal payroll (FICA) tax on health insurance premium expenditures; (9) supports legislation requiring a \"maintenance of effort\" period, such as one or two years, during which employers would be required to add to the employee's salary the cash value of any health insurance coverage they directly provide if they discont inue that coverage or if the employee opts out of the employer -provided plan; (10) encourages through all appropriate channels the development of educational programs to assist consumers in making informed choices as to sources of individual health insuran ce coverage; (11) encourages employers, unions, and other employee groups to consider the merits of risk -adjusting the amount of the employer direct contributions toward individually purchased coverage. Under such an approach, useful risk adjustment measur es such as age, sex, and family status would be used to provide higher -risk employees with a larger contribution and lower -risk employees with a lesser one; (12) supports a replacement of the present federal income tax exclusion from employees' taxable inc ome of employer -provided health insurance coverage with tax credits for individuals and families, while allowing all health insurance expenditures to be exempt from federal and state payroll taxes, including FICA (Social Security and Medicare) payroll tax, FUTA (federal unemployment tax act) payroll tax, and SUTA (state unemployment tax act) payroll tax; (13) advocates that, upon replacement, with tax credits, of the exclusion of employer -sponsored health insurance from employees' federal income tax, any st ates and municipalities conforming to this federal tax change be required to use the resulting increase in state and local tax revenues to finance health insurance tax credits, vouchers or other coverage subsidies; and (14) believes that refundable, advanc eable tax credits inversely related to income are preferred over public sector expansions as a means of providing coverage to the uninsured. (15) Our AMA reaffirms our policies committed to our patients and their individual responsibility and freedoms cons istent with our United States Constitution.

Our AMA will continue its efforts to ensure that health system reform proposals adhere to the following principles: A. Physicians maintain primary ethical responsibili ty to advocate for their patients' interests and needs. B. Unfair concentration of market power of payers is detrimental to patients and physicians, if patient freedom of choice or physician ability to select mode of practice is limited or denied. Single- payer systems clearly fall within such a definition and, consequently, should continue to be opposed by the AMA. Reform proposals should balance fairly the market power between payers and physicians or be opposed. C. All health system reform proposals shoul d include a valid estimate of implementation cost, based on all health care expenditures to be included in the reform; and supports the concept that all health system reform proposals should identify specifically what means of funding (including employer -mandated funding, general taxation, payroll or value- added taxation) will be used to pay for the reform proposal and what the impact will be. D. All physicians participating in managed care plans and medical delivery systems must be able without threat of p unitive action to comment on and present their positions on the plan's policies and procedures for medical review, quality assurance, grievance procedures, credentialing criteria, and other financial and administrative matters, including physician representation on the governing board and key committees of the plan. E. Any national legislation for health system reform should include sufficient and continuing financial support for inner -city and rural hospitals, community health centers, clinics, special programs for special populations and other essential public health facilities that serve underserved populations that otherwise lack the financial means to pay for their health care. F. Health system reform proposals and ultimate legislation should result in adequate resources to enable medical schools and residency programs to produce an adequate supply and appropriate generalist/specialist mix of physicians to deliver patient care in a reformed health care system. G. All civilian federal government employees , including Congress and the Administration, should be covered by any health care delivery system passed by Congress and signed by the President. H. True health reform is impossible without true tort reform. 2. Our AMA supports health care reform that meet s the needs of all Americans including people with injuries, congenital or acquired disabilities, and chronic conditions, and as such values function and its improvement as key outcomes to be specifically included in national health care reform legislation. 3. Our AMA supports health care reform that meets the needs of all Americans including people with mental illness and substance use / addiction disorders and will advocate for the inclusion of full parity for the treatment of mental illness and substanc e use / addiction disorders in all national health care reform legislation. Resolution: 103 (A-23) Page 10 of 11 4. Our AMA supports health system reform alternatives that are consistent with AMA principles of pluralism, freedom of choice, freedom of practice, and universal access for patients.

Our American Medical Association is committed to working with Congress, the Administration, and other stakeholders to achieve enactment of health system reforms that include the following sev en critical components of AMA policy: a. Health insurance coverage for all Americans b. Insurance market reforms that expand choice of affordable coverage and eliminate denials for pre- existing conditions or due to arbitrary caps c. Assurance that health c are decisions will remain in the hands of patients and their physicians, not insurance companies or government officials d. Investments and incentives for quality improvement and prevention and wellness initiatives e. Repeal of the Medicare physician payment formula that triggers steep cuts and threaten seniors' access to care f. Implementation of medical liability reforms to reduce the cost of defensive medicine g. Streamline and standardize insurance claims processing requirements to eliminate unnecessary costs and administrative burdens 2. Our American Medical Association advocates that elimination of denials due to pre- existing conditions is understood to include rescission of insurance coverage for reasons not related to fraudulent representation. 3. Our American Medical Association House of Delegates supports AMA leadership in their unwavering and bold efforts to promote AMA policies for health system reform in the United States. 4. Our American Medical Association supports health system reform alternat ives that are consistent with AMA policies concerning pluralism, freedom of choice, freedom of practice, and universal access for patients. 5. AMA policy is that insurance coverage options offered in a health insurance exchange be self - supporting, have uni form solvency requirements; not receive special advantages from government subsidies; include payment rates established through meaningful negotiations and contracts; not require provider participation; and not restrict enrollees' access to out -of-network physicians. 6. Our AMA will actively and publicly support the inclusion in health system reform legislation the right of patients and physicians to privately contract, without penalty to patient or physician. 7. Our AMA will actively and publicly oppose the Independent Medicare Commission (or other similar construct), which would take Medicare payment policy out of the hands of Congress and place it under the control of a group of unelected individuals. 8. Our AMA will actively and publicly oppose, in accor dance with AMA policy, inclusion of the following provisions in health system reform legislation: a. Reduced payments to physicians for failing to report quality data when there is evidence that widespread operational problems still have not been corrected by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services b. Medicare payment rate cuts mandated by a commission that would create a double- jeopardy situation for physicians who are already subject to an expenditure target and potential payment reductions under the Medicare physician payment system c. Medicare payments cuts for higher utilization with no operational mechanism to assure that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services can report accurate information that is properly attributed and risk - adjusted d. Redistributed Medicare payments among providers based on outcomes, quality, and risk -adjustment measurements that are not scientifically valid, verifiable and accurate e. Medicare payment cuts for all physician services to partially offset bonuses from one specialty to another Resolution: 103 (A-23) Page 11 of 11 f. Arbitrary restrictions on physicians who refer Medicare patients to high quality facilities in which they have an ownership interest 9. Our AMA will continue to actively engage grassroots physicians and physicians in training in collaboration with the state medical and national specialty societies to contact their Members of Congress, and that the grassroots message communicate our AMA's position based on AMA policy. 10. Our AMA will use the most effective media event or campaign to outline what physicians and patients need from health system reform. 11. AMA policy is that national health system reform must include replacing the sustainable growth rate (SGR) with a Medicare physician payment system that automatically keeps pace wi th the cost of running a practice and is backed by a fair, stable funding formula, and that the AMA initiate a \"call to action\" with the Federation to advance this goal. 12. AMA policy is that creation of a new single payer, government -run health care syst em is not in the best interest of the country and must not be part of national health system reform. 13. AMA policy is that effective medical liability reform that will significantly lower health care costs by reducing defensive medicine and eliminating unnecessary litigation from the system should be part of any national health system reform.

Citation: Res. 806, I -19; Resolution: 104 (A-23) Page 3 of 3 Protect Medicare Beneficiary Access to Complex Rehabilitation Wheelchairs D -330.907 Our AMA strongly encourages the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to refrain from implementing policies on J anuary 1, 2016 that would curtail access to complex rehabilitation technology (CRT) wheelchairs and accessories by applying competitively bid prices to these specialized devices. In the event that CMS does not refrain from implementing policies limiting ac cess to CRT wheelchairs, our AMA will encourage Congress to support legislation (e.g. H.R. 3229) that would provide a technical correction to federal law to clarify that CMS cannot apply Medicare competitive bidding pricing to CRT wheelchairs. Citation: (R es. 816, I -15) Protecting Patient Access to Seat Elevation and Standing Features in Power Wheelchairs D - 330.899 Our AMA will request that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services render a benefit category determination that establishes that the seat elevation and standing features of power wheelchairs are primarily medical in nature and qualify under the definition of durable medical equipment when used in a power wheelchair. Citation: Res. 808, I -19; Appropriate Reimbursement for Evaluation and Management Services for Patients with Severe Mobility -Related Impairments H -390.835 Our AMA supports: (1) additional reimbursement for evaluation and management services for patients who require additional time and specialized equipment duri ng medical visits due to severe mobility -related impairments; (2) that no additional cost -sharing for the additional reimbursement will be passed on to patients with mobility disabilities, consistent with Federal Law; (3) that primary and specialty medical providers be educated regarding the care of patients with severely impaired mobility to improve access to care; and (4) additional funding for payment for services provided to patients with mobility related impairments that is not through a budget neutral adjustment to the physician fee schedule. Citation: Res. 814, I -17; Community Mobility Devices H -90.978 The AMA urges physicians, who treat patients with impaired mobility outside the home, to work with state medical associations and appropriate medical specialty societies to identify state agencies and community service organizations that provide local transportation assistance to disabled individuals, and that such information be made readily accessible to disabled patients.

and 3 4 Whereas, Procedures performed for specialized patient populations such as gynecology 5 patients have been shown to be reimbursed at lower rates than those for other specialized 6 patient populations such as urology patients, despite being similar in nature1; and 7 8 Whereas, The Medicare fee schedule is a leading cause of reimbursement imbalance between 9 specialties due to documented factors, such as discrepancies in valuation of surgical 10 intraoperative time, and different valuation of procedural and physical effort to cognitive effort2; 11 and 12 13 Whereas, There is evidence to suggest that current work Relative Value Units (RVUs) are 14 misvalued as changes in work RVUs have not reflected changes in technology in some 15 specialties with undervaluation in cognitive effort, such as the management of complex 16 conditions by primary care providers3,4; and 17 18 Whereas, In comparison to higher paid specialties, lower paid specialties with a single physician 19 serving Medicare recipients are more likely to be completely absent in a given county, such that 20 92% of counties lack an addiction medicine physician and 80% of counties lack an infectious 21 disease specialist5; and 22 23 Whereas, Access to care for mental health has persisted as an issue due to provider availability 24 and reimbursement incentives6; and 25 26 Whereas, Documented racial disparities in reimbursement rates demonstrate statistically 27 significant lower mean reimbursement per RVU for insured black patients within a te rtiary 28 hospital Emergency Department compared to their white counterparts, after adjusting for 29 demographic and insurance factors7; and 30 31 Whereas, An analysis of RVUs reimbursed for gender -specific procedures revealed that 32 procedures predominantly done on men were associated with higher RVUs and compensated at 33 a rate 26.67% higher than procedures done predominantly on women1; and 34 35 Whereas, Disparity in RVUs reimbursed for similar procedures performed predominantly on 36 women versus men has minimally decreased from 1997 to 2015, with a study reporting 42 of 50 37 (84%) male- based urologic procedures compensated at a higher rate than the paired fe male 38 urologic procedures1; and 39 Resolution: 105 (A-23) Page 2 of 12 Whereas, OBGYN physicians work comparable hours and perform many surgical procedures 1 similar in number and complexity to other surgical specialties, yet their pay is the lowest 2 amongst all surgical specialties; leading to an estimated OBGYN physician shortage of 17% by 3 2030, 24% by 2040, and 31% by 2050 8,9; and 4 5 Whereas, Pediatric subspecialists are compensated at a significantly lower rate than that of 6 internal medicine subspecialists, contributing to a high percentage of vacant seats across 7 pediatric fellowship programs and a resulting shortage of pediatric subspecialis ts 10-12; and 8 9 Whereas, The compensation of pediatric sub -specialists is lower than general pediatricians, de - 10 incentivizing trainees to pursue fellowships in that realm, with a study finding the salary of 11 pediatric endocrinologists to be 10% lower than that of general pediatricians13-15; and 12 13 Whereas, Pediatric infectious disease specialists experience the lowest compensation of all 14 physicians, earning $191,735 compared to $265,000 earned by adult infectious disease 15 specialists 13-15; and 16 17 Whereas, Most pediatric subspecialty programs experience a significant fraction of unfilled 18 seats; for example, 40.6% of pediatric nephrologist fellowship seats were not filled in 2019, 19 indicating both trainee disinterest and a lack of provider availability, which can negatively impact 20 access to care and contribute to longer wait times10,16; and 21 22 Whereas, Medicare and Medicaid often function as a safety net for hospitals by reimbursing 23 institutions for expenses of hospitalizations not paid by patients themselves, and often falls short 24 of covering the hospitals' care -delivery costs17,18; and 25 26 Whereas, Lower reimbursements for specialties that care for certain underserved patient 27 populations may disincentivize physicians from entering those specialties and providing care for 28 the corresponding patient populations, or disincentivize hospitals to provide such care19,20; and 29 30 Whereas, Not only is the ratio of specialists to primary care physicians (PCP) higher in the U.S. 31 than in other countries, it has been documented by studies as being due to U.S. ratio of 32 specialist to PCP compensation rates exceeding other countries' specialist to PCP 33 compensation rates21-24; and 34 35 Whereas, An American College of Physicians position statement holds that \"Medicare and other 36 payers should adopt population- based, prospective payment models for primary and 37 comprehensive care that are structured and sufficient to ensure access to needed care and 38 address the needs of individuals experiencing health care disparities and inequities based on 39 personal characteristics and/or are disproportionately affected by social drivers of health. Hybrid 40 models combining fee -for-service with prospective payment should be made available and 41 should prioritize the needs of such individuals\"25; and 42 43 Whereas, The Center for Medicare Services' most recent publication of the Medicare payment 44 schedule came with an official solicitation for comments on how the agency can advance health 45 equity for people with Medicare26; and 46 47 Whereas, The National Academy of Medicine Committee for Medicare recommends a potential 48 policy remedy to use reimbursements to incentivize care for underserved populations: a per - 49 patient payment adjustment for patients' social risks, deliberately connected to the quality of 50 patient outcomes; an approach that requires separate reporting of quality measures for 51 Resolution: 105 (A-23) Page 3 of 12 hospitals in different categories related to distinct levels of social risk in the populations they 1 serve and includes an additional financial incentive for quality improvement27,28; and 2 3 Whereas, Financial incentives can reward hospitals for incremental improvements in quality 4 measures against their own historical benchmarks, and promote closing gaps in the quality of 5 care that may be worse among institutions primarily serving disadvantaged populations27,28; and 6 7 Whereas, Anchor institutions are (organizations that commit themselves to hiring, procuring, 8 and investing in disadvantaged communities) and would earn enriched reimbursement for the 9 patients they serve from those same or similarly disadvantaged communities29; and 10 11 Whereas, Another policy alternative to use reimbursement to promote care for underserved 12 populations is to promote hospitals that achieve certain metrics in key domains to be qualified 13 as anchor institutions29; and 14 15 Whereas, A study found that the choice of a higher -income specialty was associated with lower 16 burnout (OR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.32- 0.98)30; and 17 18 Whereas, Medical students have indicated difficulty in completing loan repayments due to 19 increasing tuition rates and lack of financial compensation as deterrents to entering certain 20 fields and caring for certain populations25, 31; and 21 22 Whereas, Nearly half (48%) of graduating medical students cite income as a strong or moderate 23 influence on their decision to pursue a certain specialty, and only 20% stated that it has no 24 influence on their decision of which specialty to choose20; and 25 26 Whereas, Current AMA Policy H -65.961 states that the AMA \"declares that compensation 27 should be equitable and based on demonstrated competencies and expertise and not based on 28 personal characteristics,\" which can include the type of population a physician serves or the 29 specialty they practice; therefore be it 30 31 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association study opportunities to incentivize 32 physicians to select specialties and practice settings which involve delivery of health services to 33 populations experiencing a shortage of providers, such as women, LGBTQ+ patients, children, 34 elder adults, and patients with disabilities, including populations of such patients who do not live 35 in underserved geographic areas (Directive to Take Action) ; and be it further 36 37 RESOLVED, That our AMA study the effects of factors such as valuation and reimbursement 38 rates on physician choice of specialty, degree of institutional support, workforce shortages, 39 burnout, and attrition, especially in specialties and practice settings that primarily care for 40 underserved populations.

Physician leaders in medical schools and medical institutions should advocate for increased leadership in medicine among individuals of underrepresented genders and equitable compensation for all physicians. Collectively, physicians should actively advocate for and develop family -friendly policies that: (a) Promote fairness in the workplace, including providing for: (i) retraining or other programs that facilitate re- entry by physicians who take time away from their careers to have a family; (ii) on -site child care services for dependent children; (iii) job security for physicians who are temporarily not in practice due to pregnancy or family obligations. (b) Promote fairness in academic medical settings by: (i) ensuring that tenure decisions make allowance for family obligations by giving faculty members longer to achieve standards for promotion and tenure; (ii) establish more reasonable guidelines regarding the quantity and timing of published material needed for promotion or tenure that emphasize quality over quantity and encourage the pursuit of careers based on individual talent rather than tenure standards that undervalue teaching ability and overvalue research; (iii) fairly distribute teaching, clinical, research, administrative responsibilities, and access to tenure tracks; (iv) structuring the mentoring process through a fair and visible system. (c) Ta ke steps to mitigate gender bias in research and publication. Issued: 2016 Principles for Advancing Gender Equity in Medicine H -65.961 Principles for Advancing Gender Equity in Medicine: Our AMA: 1. declares it is opposed to any exploitation and discrimination in the workplace based on personal characteristics (i.e., gender); 2. affirms the concept of equal rights for all physicians and that the concept of equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the U.S. Government or by any state on account of gender; 3. endorses the principle of equal opportunity of employment and practice in the medical field; 4. affirms its commitment to the full involvement of women in leadership roles throughout the federation, and encourages all components of the federation to vigorously continue their efforts to recruit women members into organized medicine; 5. acknowledges that mentorship and sponsorship are integral components of one's career advancement, and encourages physicians to engage in such activ ities; 6. declares that compensation should be equitable and based on demonstrated competencies/expertise and not based on personal characteristics; 7. recognizes the importance of part -time work options, job sharing, flexible scheduling, re- entry, and contract negotiations as options for physicians to support work -life balance; 8. affirms that transparency in pay scale and promotion criteria is necessary to promote gender equity, and as such academic medical centers, medical schools, hospitals, group practices and other physician employers should conduct periodic reviews of compensation and promotion rates by gender and evaluate protocols for advancement to determine whether the criteria are discriminatory; and 9. affirms that medical schools, institutions and professional associations should provide training on leadership development, contract and salary negotiations and career advancement strategies that include an analysis of the influence of gender in these skill areas. Our AMA encourages: (1) state and specialty societies, academic medical centers, medical schools, hospitals, group practices and other physician employers to adopt the AMA Principles for Advancing Gender Equity in Medicine; and (2) academic medical centers, medical schools, hospitals, group practices and other physician employers to: (a) adopt policies that prohibit harassment, discrimination and retaliation; (b) provide anti -harassment training; and (c) prescribe disciplinary and/or corrective action should violation of such policies occur . Citation: BOT Rep. 27, A -19; Resolution: 105 (A-23) Page 6 of 12 Advancing Gender Equity in Medicine D -65.989 1. Our AMA will: (a) advocate for institutional, departmental and practice policies that promote transparency in defining the criteria for initial and subsequent physician compensation; (b) advocate for pay structures based on objective, gender -neutral criteria; (c) encourage a specified approach, sufficient to identify gender disparity, to oversight of compensation models, metrics, and actual total compensation for all employed physicians; and (d) advocate for training to identify and mitigate implicit bias in compensation determination for those in positions to determine salary and bonuses, with a focus on how subtle differences in the further evaluation of physic ians of different genders may impede compensation and career advancement. 2. Our AMA will recommend as immediate actions to reduce gender bias: (a) elimination of the question of prior salary information from job applications for physician recruitment in academic and private practice; (b) create an awareness campaign to inform physicians about their rights under the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and Equal Pay Act; (c) establish educational programs to help empower all genders to negotiate equitable compensat ion; (d) work with relevant stakeholders to host a workshop on the role of medical societies in advancing women in medicine, with co- development and broad dissemination of a report based on workshop findings; and (e) create guidance for medical schools and health care facilities for institutional transparency of compensation, and regular gender -based pay audits. 3. Our AMA will collect and analyze comprehensive demographic data and produce a study on the inclusion of women members including, but not limited to, membership, representation in the House of Delegates, reference committee makeup, and leadership positions within our AMA, including the Board of Trustees, Councils and Section governance, plenary speaker invitations, recognition awards, and grant funding, and disseminate such findings in regular reports to the House of Delegates and making recommendations to support gender equity. 4. Our AMA will commit to pay equity across the organization by asking our Board of Trustees to undertake routine assessments of salaries within and across the organization, while making the necessary adjustments to ensure equal pay for equal work. 5. Our AMA will: (a) require all members elected and appointed to national and regional AMA leadership positions to complete AMA Code of Conduct and anti -harassment training, with continued evaluation of the training for effectiveness in reducing harassment within the AMA; and (b) work with the Women Physicians Section, American Medical Women's Association, GLMA: Health Professional s Advancing LGBTQ Equality, and other stakeholders to identify an appropriate, evidence- based anti -harassment and sexual harassment prevention training to administer to leadership. Citation: Res. 010, A -18; Modified: BOT Rep. 27, A -19; Appended: Res. 615, A -22; Medical Care of Persons with Disabilities H -90.968 1. Our AMA encourages: (a) clinicians to learn and appreciate variable presentations of complex functioning profiles in all persons with disabilities including but not limited to physical, sensory, developmental, intellectual, learning, and psychiatric disabilities and chronic illnesses; (b) medical schools and graduate medical education programs to acknowledge the benefits of education on how aspects in the social model of disability (e.g. ableism) can impact the physical and mental health of persons with disabilities; (c) medical schools and graduate medical education programs to acknowledge the benefits of teaching about the nuances of uneven skill sets, often found in the functioning profiles of persons with developmental disabilities, to improve quality in clinical care; (d) education of physicians on how to provide and/or advocate for developmentally appropriate and accessible medical, social and living support for patients with disabilities so as to improve health outcomes; (e) medical schools and residency programs to encourage faculty and trainees to appreciate the opportunities for exploring diagnostic and therapeutic challenges while also accruing significant personal rewards when delivering care with professionalism to persons with profound disabilities and multiple co- morbid medical conditions in any setting; (f) medical schools and graduate medical education programs to establish and encourage enrollment in elective rotations for medical st udents and residents at health care facilities specializing in care for the disabled; and (g) cooperation among physicians, health & human services professionals, and a wide variety of adults with disabilities to implement priorities and quality improvements for the care of persons with disabilities. 2. Our AMA seeks: (a) legislation to increase the funds available for training physicians in the care of individuals with disabilities, and to increase the reimbursement for the health care of these individual s; and (b) insurance industry and government reimbursement that reflects the true cost of health care of individuals with disabilities. 3. Our AMA entreats health care professionals, parents, and others participating in decision- making to be Resolution: 105 (A-23) Page 7 of 12 guided by the following principles: (a) All people with disabilities, regardless of the degree of their disability, should have access to appropriate and affordable medical and dental care throughout their lives; and (b) An individual's medical condition and welfare must be the basis of any medical decision. Our AMA advocates for the highest quality medical care for persons with profound disabilities; encourages support for health care facilities whose primary mission is to meet the health care needs of persons with pro found disabilities; and informs physicians that when they are presented with an opportunity to care for patients with profound disabilities, that there are resources available to them. 4. Our AMA will collaborate with appropriate stakeholders to create a model general curriculum/objective that (a) incorporates critical disability studies; and (b) includes people with disabilities as patient instructors in formal training sessions and preclinical and clinical instruction. 5. Our AMA recognizes the importance of managing the health of children and adults with developmental and intellectual disabilities as a part of overall patient care for the entire community. 6. Our AMA supports efforts to educate physicians on health management of children and adults wit h intellectual and developmental disabilities, as well as the consequences of poor health management on mental and physical health for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. 7. Our AMA encourages the Liaison Committee on Medical Education, Commission of Osteopathic College Accreditation, and allopathic and osteopathic medical schools to develop and implement a curriculum on the care and treatment of people with a range of disabilities. 8. Our AMA encourages the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education and graduate medical education programs to develop and implement curriculum on providing appropriate and comprehensive health care to people with a range of disabilities. 9. Our AMA encourages the Accreditation Council for Conti nuing Medical Education, specialty boards, and other continuing medical education providers to develop and implement continuing programs that focus on the care and treatment of people with a range of disabilities. 10. Our AMA will advocate that the Health Resources and Services Administration include persons with disabilities as a medically underserved population. 11. Specific to people with developmental and intellectual disabilities, a uniquely underserved population, our AMA encourages: (a) medical schools and graduate medical education programs to acknowledge the benefits of teaching about the nuances of uneven skill sets, often found in the functioning profiles of persons with developmental and intellectual disabilities, to improve quality in clinical education; (b) medical schools and graduate medical education programs to establish and encourage enrollment in elective rotations for medical students and residents at health care facilities specializing in care for individuals with developmental and int ellectual disabilities; and (c) cooperation among physicians, health and human services professionals, and a wide variety of adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities to implement priorities and quality improvements for the care of persons wi th intellectual and developmental disabilities.

Our patients require a sufficient, well -trained supply of primary care physicians --family physicians, general internists, general pediatricians, and obstetricians/gynecologists --to me et the nation's current and projected demand for health care services. 2. To help accomplish this critical goal, our American Medical Association (AMA) will work with a variety of key stakeholders, to include federal and state legislators and regulatory bodies; national and state specialty societies and medical associations, including those representing primary care fields; and accreditation, certification, licensing, and regulatory bodies from across the continuum of medical education (undergraduate, gradu ate, and continuing medical education). 3. Through its work with these stakeholders, our AMA will encourage development and dissemination of innovative models to recruit medical students interested in primary care, train primary care physicians, and enhanc e both the perception and the reality of primary care practice, to encompass the following components: a) Changes to medical school admissions and recruitment of medical students to primary care specialties, including counseling of medical students as they develop their career plans; b) Curriculum changes throughout the medical education continuum; c) Expanded financial aid and debt relief options; d) Financial and logistical support for primary care practice, including adequate reimbursement, and enhancements to the practice environment to ensure professional satisfaction and practice sustainability; and e) Support for research and advocacy related to primary care. Resolution: 105 (A-23) Page 8 of 12 4. Admissions and recruitment: The medical school admissions process should reflect the speci fic institution's mission. Those schools with missions that include primary care should consider those predictor variables among applicants that are associated with choice of these specialties. 5. Medical schools, through continued and expanded recruitment and outreach activities into secondary schools, colleges, and universities, should develop and increase the pool of applicants likely to practice primary care by seeking out those students whose profiles indicate a likelihood of practicing in primary care and underserved areas, while establishing strict guidelines to preclude discrimination. 6. Career counseling and exposure to primary care: Medical schools should provide to students career counseling related to the choice of a primary care specialty, and ensure that primary care physicians are well-represented as teachers, mentors, and role models to future physicians. 7. Financial assistance programs should be created to provide students with primary care experiences in ambulatory settings, especially in underserved areas. These could include funded preceptorships or summer work/study opportunities. 8. Curriculum: Voluntary efforts to develop and expand both undergraduate and graduate medical education programs to educate primary care physicians in increas ing numbers should be continued. The establishment of appropriate administrative units for all primary care specialties should be encouraged. 9. Medical schools with an explicit commitment to primary care should structure the curriculum to support this obj ective. At the same time, all medical schools should be encouraged to continue to change their curriculum to put more emphasis on primary care. 10. All four years of the curriculum in every medical school should provide primary care experiences for all stu dents, to feature increasing levels of student responsibility and use of ambulatory and community - based settings. 11. Federal funding, without coercive terms, should be available to institutions needing financial support to expand resources for both undergraduate and graduate medical education programs designed to increase the number of primary care physicians. Our AMA will advocate for public (federal and state) and private payers to a) develop enhanced funding and related incentives from all sources to pr ovide education for medical students and resident/fellow physicians, respectively, in progressive, community - based models of integrated care focused on quality and outcomes (such as the patient -centered medical home and the chronic care model) to enhance primary care as a career choice; b) fund and foster innovative pilot programs that change the current approaches to primary care in undergraduate and graduate medical education, especially in urban and rural underserved areas; and c) evaluate these efforts for their effectiveness in increasing the number of students choosing primary care careers and helping facilitate the elimination of geographic, racial, and other health care disparities. 12. Medical schools and teaching hospitals in underserved areas should promote medical student and resident/fellow physician rotations through local family health clinics for the underserved, with financial assistance to the clinics to compensate their teaching efforts. 13. The curriculum in primary care residency programs and training sites should be consistent with the objective of training generalist physicians. Our AMA will encourage the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education to (a) support primary care residency programs, including community hospital -base d programs, and (b) develop an accreditation environment and novel pathways that promote innovations in graduate medical education, using progressive, community -based models of integrated care focused on quality and outcomes (such as the patient -centered m edical home and the chronic care model). 14. The visibility of primary care faculty members should be enhanced within the medical school, and positive attitudes toward primary care among all faculty members should be encouraged. 15. Support for practicing primary care physicians: Administrative support mechanisms should be developed to assist primary care physicians in the logistics of their practices, along with enhanced efforts to reduce administrative activities unrelated to patient care, to help ensure professional satisfaction and practice sustainability. 16. There should be increased financial incentives for physicians practicing primary care, especially those in rural and urban underserved areas, to include scholarship or loan repayment programs, reli ef of professional liability burdens, and Medicaid case management programs, among others. Our AMA will advocate to state and federal legislative and regulatory bodies, among others, for development of public and/or private incentive programs, and expansion and increased funding for existing programs, to further encourage practice in underserved areas and decrease the debt load of primary care physicians. The imposition of specific outcome targets should be resisted, especially in the absence of additional support to the schools. 17. Our AMA will continue to advocate, in collaboration with relevant specialty societies, for the recommendations from the AMA/Specialty Society RVS Update Committee (RUC) related to Resolution: 105 (A-23) Page 9 of 12 reimbursement for E&M services and coverage of s ervices related to care coordination, including patient education, counseling, team meetings and other functions; and work to ensure that private payers fully recognize the value of E&M services, incorporating the RUC -recommended increases adopted for the most current Medicare RBRVS. 18. Our AMA will advocate for public (federal and state) and private payers to develop physician reimbursement systems to promote primary care and specialty practices in progressive, community - based models of integrated care focused on quality and outcomes such as the patient -centered medical home and the chronic care model consistent with current AMA Policies H -160.918 and H -160.919. 19. There should be educational support systems for primary care physicians, especially those practicing in underserved areas. 20. Our AMA will urge urban hospitals, medical centers, state medical associations, and specialty societies to consider the expanded use of mobile health care capabilities. 21. Our AMA will encourage the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to explore the use of telemedicine to improve access to and support for urban primary care practices in underserved settings. 22. Accredited continuing medical education providers should promote and establish continuing medical educati on courses in performing, prescribing, interpreting and reinforcing primary care services. 23. Practicing physicians in other specialties --particularly those practicing in underserved urban or rural areas --should be provided the opportunity to gain specifi c primary care competencies through short -term preceptorships or postgraduate fellowships offered by departments of family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, etc., at medical schools or teaching hospitals. In addition, part -time training should be encouraged, to allow physicians in these programs to practice concurrently, and further research into these concepts should be encouraged. 24. Our AMA supports continued funding of Public Health Service Act, Title VII, Section 747, and encourages advocacy in this regard by AMA members and the public. 25. Research: Analysis of state and federal financial assistance programs should be undertaken, to determine if these programs are having the desired workforce effects, particularly for students from disadvantaged groups and those that are underrepresented in medicine, and to gauge the impact of these programs on elimination of geographic, racial, and other health care disparities. Additional research should identify the factors that deter students and physicians from choosing and remaining in primary care disciplines. Further, our AMA should continue to monitor trends in the choice of a primary care specialty and the availability of primary care graduate medical education positions. The results of thes e and related research endeavors should support and further refine AMA policy to enhance primary care as a career choice. Citation: CME Rep. 04, I -18; Reimbursement to Physicians and Hospitals for Government Mandated Services H -240.966 (1) It is the polic y of the AMA that government mandated services imposed on physicians and hospitals that are peripheral to the direct medical care of patients be recognized as additional practice cost expense. (2) Our AMA will accelerate its plans to develop quantitative i nformation on the actual costs of regulations. (3) Our AMA strongly urges Congress that the RBRVS and DRG formulas take into account these additional expenses incurred by physicians and hospitals when complying with governmentally mandated regulations and ensure that reimbursement increases are adequate to cover the costs of providing these services. (4) Our AMA will advocate to the CMS and Congress that an equitable adjustment to the Medicare physician fee schedule (or another appropriate mechanism deemed appropriate by CMS or Congress) be developed to provide fair compensation to offset the additional professional and practice expenses required to comply with the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act.

Citation: Res. 814, I -17; RVS Updating H -400.969 Status Report and Future Plans: The AMA/Specialty Society RVS Update Committee (RUC) represents an important opportunity for the medical profession to maintain professional control of the clinical practice of medicine. The AMA urges each and every organization represented in its House of Delegates to become an advocate for the RUC process in its interactions with the federal government and with its physician members. The AMA (1) will continue to urge CMS to adopt the recommendations of the AMA/Specialty Soc iety RVS Update Committee for physician work relative values for new and revised CPT codes; (2) supports strongly use of this AMA/Specialty Society process as the principal method of refining and maintaining the Medicare RVS; (3) encourages CMS to rely upon this process as it considers new methodologies for addressing the practice expense components of the Medicare RVS and other RBRVS issues; and (4) opposes changes in Relative Value Units that are in excess of those recommended by the AMA/Specialty Society Relative Value Scale Update Committee (RUC).

Res. 104, A -14; Reaffirmed in lieu of Res. 216, I -14; Reaffirmation A -15) Guidelines for the Resource -Based Relative Value Scale H -400.991 (1) The AMA reaffirms its current policy in support of adoption of a fair and equitable Medicare indemnity payment schedule under which physicians would determine their own fees and Medicare would establish its payments for physician services using: (a) an appropriate RVS based on the resource costs of providing physician services; (b) an appropriate monetary conversion factor; and (c) an appropriate set of conversion factor multipliers. (2) The AMA supports the position that the current Harvard RBRVS study and data, when sufficiently expanded, corrected and refined, would provide an acceptable basis for a Medicare indemnity payment system. (3) The AMA reaffirms its strong support for physicians' right to decide on a claim- by-claim basis whether or not to accept Medicare assignment and its opposition to elimination of balance billing. (Reaffirmed: Sub. Res. 132, A -94) (4) The AMA reaffirms its opposition to the continuation of the Medicare maximum allowable actual charge (MAAC) limits. (5) The AMA promotes enhanced physician discussion of fees with patients as an ex plicit objective of a Medicare indemnity payment system. (6) The AMA supports expanding its activities in support of state and county medical society -initiated voluntary assignment programs for low -income Medicare beneficiaries. (7) The AMA reaffirms its c urrent policy that payments under a Medicare indemnity payment system should reflect valid and demonstrable geographic differences in practice costs, including professional liability insurance premiums. In addition, as warranted and feasible, the costs of such premiums should be reflected in the payment system in a manner distinct from the treatment of other practice costs. (8) The AMA believes that payment localities should be determined based on principles of reasonableness, flexibility and common sense ( e.g., localities could consist of a combination of regions, states, and metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas within states) based on the availability of high quality data. (9) The AMA believes that, in addition to adjusting indemnity payments based on geographic practice cost differentials, a method of adjusting payments to effectively remedy demonstrable access problems in specific geographic areas should be developed and implemented. (10) Where specialty differentials exist, criteria for specialty designation should avoid sole dependence on rigid criteria, such as board certification or completion of residency training. Instead, a variety of general national criteria should be utilized, with carriers having sufficient flexibility to respond to local conditions. In addition to board certification or completion of a residency, such criteria could include, but not be limited to: (a) partial completion of a residency plus time in practice; (b) local peer recognition; and (c) carrier analysis of practice patterns. A provision should also be implemented to protect the patients of physicians who have practiced as specialists for a number of years. Resolution: 105 (A-23) Page 12 of 12 (11) The AMA strongly opposes any attempt to use the initial implementation or subsequent use of any new Medicare payment system to freeze or cut Medicare expenditures for physician services in order to produce federal budget savings. (12) The AMA believes that whatever process is selected to update the RVS and conversion factor, only the AMA has the resources, experience and umbrella structure necessary to represent the collective interests of medicine, and that it seek to do so with appropriate mechanisms for full participation from all of organized medicine, especially taking advantage of the unique contributions of national medical specialty societies.

Citation: Res. 005, A -18; AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 106 (A-23) Introduced by: Medical Student Section Subject: Billing for Traditional Healing Services Referred to: Reference Committee A Whereas, The Indian Health Service (IHS), an agency within the U.S. Department of Health 1 and Human Services, is responsible for providing health services to American Indians and 2 Alaska Natives (AI/AN), as a federal trust responsibility and treaty obligations to American 3 Indian and Alaska Native Tribes and Villages1-2; and 4 5 Whereas, The IHS is underfunded relative to other federal health programs, IHS per capita 6 health care expenditures are $4,078, while figures for Medicaid and Medicare are $8,109 and 7 $13,185, respectively3; and 8 9 Whereas, The IHS is considered the payor of last resort and is only utilized after other 10 federal, state, local, or private source of reimbursement for which the patient is eligible have 11 been exhausted4; and 12 13 Whereas, Reimbursement sources utilized before IHS payment include, but are not limited to, 14 Medicare Part A and B, State Medicaid, State or other federal health programs (e.g., 15 Veterans Health Administration), private insurance, and funds from Tribal health programs4; 16 and 17 18 Whereas, Payments for IHS patients' medical care received from public programs such as 19 Medicaid and Medicare or from private insurers \u2014increased from about $943 million in fisc al 20 year 2015 to about $1.15 billion in fiscal year 2019 at its federal facilities5; and 21 22 Whereas, Third -party collections are increasingly important, representing a significant portion 23 of IHS, Tribal, and Urban Indian Health Programs' health care delivery budget, and also used 24 to procure services, supplies, and pharmaceuticals5; and 25 26 Whereas, The IHS, through offerings of Western medicine and traditional healing services, 27 works to ensure that culturally -appropriate health care services are available and acc essible 28 to AI/AN patients6; and 29 30 Whereas, Traditional medicine is the sum total of the knowledge, skills, and practices based 31 on the theories, beliefs, and experiences specific to different cultures, whether explicable or 32 not, used in the maintenance of health as well as in the prevention, diagnosis, improvement 33 or treatment of physical and mental illness7; and 34 35 Whereas, In a survey of 150 AI/AN patients at one Urban Indian Health Program, 38% 36 reported seeking medical care from both a physician and a traditional healer in their 37 community8; and 38 Resolution: 106 (A-23) Page 2 of 6 Whereas, In another rural, reservation- based setting of 2,595 AI/AN adolescents and adults, 1 41 to 60% sought biomedical services for physical health concerns; 8 to 23% sought 2 traditional healing services for physical health concerns; and 10- 23% used Western and 3 traditional healing services, while 3 to 40% used only traditional healing9; and 4 5 Whereas, Among AI/AN patients who see both a physician and a traditional healer, more 6 than half (61.4%) trust the advice of their traditional healer(s) over their physician, and may 7 also limit disclosure of their medical history due to medical distrust and poor coordination of 8 care8,10; and 9 10 Whereas, The American Medical Association recognizes the \" medicine man\" and other 11 traditional healing figures as an integral and culturally necessary part in delivering health care 12 to AI/AN patients (H -350.976); and 13 14 Whereas, A study evaluating the efficacy of many traditional Cherokee medicines found that 15 their use was efficient for treating intended illness, and was adopted by European settlers 16 following their introduction to them11; and 17 18 Whereas, Connections to traditional culture, including food, has a positive impact on spiritual 19 and physical health and decreases rates of chronic disease within AI/AN populations12,13; and 20 21 Whereas, The Alaska Native Medical Center, the major referral unit for AI/AN patients within 22 the state of Alaska, offers a Traditional Healing Clinic in conjunction with other health 23 services to provid e whole- person care to patients14; and 24 25 Whereas, The IHS cannot bill private insurance and state Medicaid programs and Medicaid 26 managed care organizations for traditional healing services, limiting reimbursement for and 27 implementation of traditional healing services at IHS, Tribal, and Urban Indian health 28 facilities15; and 29 30 Whereas, Traditional healing practices and knowledge are widely considered sacred and not 31 shared with outside healthcare practitioners16; and 32 33 Whereas, The diversity of traditional healing practices between AI/AN Tribes and Villages 34 creates challenges for creating medical billing codes and reimbursement processes; and 35 36 Whereas, The state of Arizona, in consultation with Tribes, is seeking Section 1115 37 demonstration authority to cover traditional healing services furnished by the IHS to AI/AN 38 Medicaid enrollees17-18; and 39 40 Whereas, The proposed Arizona Section 1115 Medicaid waiver for traditional healing 41 services would (1) allow IHS, Tribal, and Urban Indian Health Programs and AI/AN Tribes 42 and Villages designate and contract with traditional healing providers; (2) coordinate medical 43 care and traditional healing delivery to prevent medical contraindications; and (3) require 44 patient evaluation of traditional healing services18; and 45 46 Whereas, W hile the IHS and Congress have long noted their acceptance and respect for 47 AI/AN traditional healing services, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act does not explicitly 48 define or authorize traditional healing services to be paid for by the IHS17-19; there fore be it 49 Resolution: 106 (A-23) Page 3 of 6 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association study the impact of Medicaid waivers 1 for managed care demonstration projects regarding implementation and reimbursement for 2 traditional American Indian and Alaska Native healing practices provided in concert with 3 physician- led healthcare teams.

The AMA specifically recommends: (1) Indian Population: (a) In current education programs, and in the expansion of educational activities suggested below, special consideration be given to involving the American Indian and Alaska native population in training for the various health professions, in the expectation that such professionals, if provided with adequate professional resources, facilities, and income, will be more likely to serve the tribal areas permanently; (b) Exploration with American Indian leaders of the possibility of increased numbers of nonfederal American Indian health centers, under tribal sponsorship, to expand the American Indian role in its own health care; (c) Increased involvement of private practitioners and facilities in American Indian care, through such mechanisms as agreements with tribal leaders or Indian Health Service contracts, as well as normal private practice relationships; and (d) Improvement in transportation to make access to existing private care easier for the American Indian population. (2) Federal Facilities : Based on the distribution of the eligible population, transportation facilities and roads, and the availability of alternative nonfederal resources, the AMA recommends that those Indian Health Service facilities currently necessary for American Indian care be identified and that an i mmediate construction and modernization program be initiated to bring these facilities up to current standards of practice and accreditation. (3)Manpower : (a) Compensation for Indian Health Service physicians be increased to a level competitive with other Federal agencies and nongovernmental service; (b) Consideration should be given to increased compensation for service in remote areas; (c) In conjunction with improvement of Service facilities, efforts should be made to establish closer ties with teaching centers, thus increasing both the available manpower and the level of professional expertise available for consultation; (d) Allied health professional staffing of Service facilities should be maintained at a level appropriate to the special needs of the population served; (e) Continuing education opportunities should be provided for those health professionals serving these communities, and especially those in remote areas, and, increased peer contact, both to maintain the quality of care and to avert professional isolation; and (f) Consideration should be given to a federal statement of policy supporting continuation of the Public Health Service to reduce the great uncertainty now felt by many career officers of the corps. (4)Medical Societies : In those states where Indian Health Service facilities are located, and in counties containing or adjacent to Service facilities, that the appropriate medical societies should explore the possibility of increased formal liaison with local Indian Health Service physicians. Increased support from organized medicine for improvement of health care provided under their direction, including professional consultation and involvement in society activities should be pursued. (5) Our AMA also support the removal of any requirement for competitive bidding in the Indian Health Service that compromises proper care for the American Indian population. Citation: (CLRPD Rep. 3, I -98; Reaffirmed: CLRPD 08; Reaffirmation A -12; Reaffirmed: Res. 233, A -13) Improving Health Care of American Indians H -350.976 Our AMA recommends that: (1) All individuals, special interest groups, and levels of government recognize the American Indian people as full citizens of the U.S., entitled to the same equal rights and privileges as other U.S. c itizens. (2) The federal government provide sufficient funds to support needed health services for American Indians. (3) State and local governments give special attention to the health and health- related needs of nonreservation American Indians in an effort to improve their quality of life. (4) American Indian religions and cultural beliefs be recognized and respected by those responsible for planning and providing services in Indian health programs. (5) Our AMA recognize the \"medicine man\" as an integral and culturally necessary individual in delivering health care to American Indians. (6) Strong emphasis be given to mental health programs for American Indians in an effort to reduce the high incidence of alcoholism, homicide, suicide, and accidents. (7) A team approach drawing from traditional health providers supplemented by psychiatric social workers, health aides, visiting nurses, and health educators be utilized in solving these problems. (8) Our AMA continue its liaison with the Indian Health Service and the National Indian Health Board and Resolution: 106 (A-23) Page 5 of 6 establish a liaison with the Association of American Indian Physicians. (9) State and county medical associations establish liaisons with intertribal health councils in those states where American Indians reside. (10) Our AMA supports and encourages further development and use of innovative delivery systems and staffing configurations to meet American Indian health needs but opposes overemphasis on research for the sake of research, particularly if needed federal fun ds are diverted from direct services for American Indians. (11) Our AMA strongly supports those bills before Congressional committees that aim to improve the health of and health- related services provided to American Indians and further recommends that mem bers of appropriate AMA councils and committees provide testimony in favor of effective legislation and proposed regulations.

Our AMA encourages physicians to engage in the development of Physician- Focused Payment Models by seeking guidance and refinement assistance from the Physician- Focused Payment Model Technical Advisory Committee (PTAC). 2. Our AMA will continue to urge CMS to limit financial risk requirements to costs that physicians participating in an APM have the ab ility to influence or control. 3. Our AMA will continue to advocate for innovative ways of defining financial risk, such as including start - up investments and ongoing costs of participation in the risk calculation that would alleviate the financial barrier to physician participation in APMs. 4. Our AMA will work with CMS, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), PTAC, interested medical societies, and other organizations to pursue the following to improve the availabil ity and use of health information technology (IT): a. Continue to expand technical assistance; b. Develop IT systems that support and streamline clinical participation; c. Enable health IT to support bi -directional data exchange to provide physicians with useful reports and analyses based on the data provided; d. Identify methods to reduce the data collection burden; and e. Begin implementing the 21st Century Cures Act. 5. Our AMA will work with CMS, PTAC, interested medical societies, and other organizations to design risk adjustment systems that: a. Identify new data sources to enable adequate analyses of clinical and non- clinical factors that contribute to a patients health and success of treatment, such as disease stage and socio- demographic factors; b. Account for differences in patient needs, such as functional limitations, changes in medical conditions compared to historical data, and ability to access health care services; and c. Explore an approach in which the physician managing a patients care can contribute additional information, such as disease severity, that may not be available in existing risk adjustment methods to more accurately determine the appropriate risk stratification. 6. Our AMA will work with CMS, PTAC, interested medical societies, and other organizations to improve attribution methods through the following actions: a. Develop methods to assign the costs of care among physicians in proportion to the amount of care they provided and/or controlled within the episode; b. Dist inguish between services ordered by a physician and those delivered by a physician; Resolution: 106 (A-23) Page 6 of 6 c. Develop methods to ensure a physician is not attributed costs they cannot control or costs for patients no longer in their care; d. Explore implementing a voluntary appr oach wherein the physician and patient agree that the physician will be responsible for managing the care of a particular condition, potentially even having a contract that articulates the patients and physicians responsibility for managing the condition; and e. Provide physicians with lists of attributed patients to improve care coordination. 7. Our AMA will work with CMS, PTAC, interested medical societies, and other organizations to improve performance target setting through the following actions: a. Analyze and disseminate data on how much is currently being spent on a given condition, how much of that spending is potentially avoidable through an APM, and the potential impact of an APM on costs and spending; b.

RELEVANT AMA POLICY Medicare Claims Data Release D -406.993 Our AMA will: (1) continue to work with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to identify appropriate modifications to improve the usefulness and accuracy of any existing or future provider - specific data released by that agency; (2) engage with data experts and other stakeholders to develop guiding principles on the data and transparency efforts that should be pursued in order to assist physicians to improve the quality of care and reduce costs; (3) petition the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Office of Health & Human Services to remove practice expense and malpractice expense from reimbursements reported to the public; and (4) in an effort to advance the feasibility of population health research to fulfill the promise of value based care, will request that CMS eliminate the prohibitions on sharing data outside of any CMS model including Accountable Care Organizations that are contained in the CMS Data Use Agreement and allow sharing of that data: (a) in the form of de- identified data sets as permitted by federal, state, and local privacy laws; and (b) for purposes of research as permitted by federal, state, and local privacy laws. Citation: Sub. Res. 204, A -14; Appended: Res. 226, A -17; Appended: Res. 241, A- 19; Work of the Task Force on the Release of Physician Data H -406.990 Release of Claims and Payment Data from Governmental Programs The AMA encourages the use of physician data to benefit both patients and physicians and to improve the quality of patient care and the efficient use of resources in the delivery of health care services. The AMA supports this use of physician data only when it preserves access to health care and is used to provide accurate physician performance assessments. Raw claims data used in isolation have significant limitations. The release of such data from government programs must be subject to safeguards to ensure that neither false nor misleading conclusions are derived that could undermine the delivery of appropriate and quality care. If not addressed, the limitations of such data are significant. The foregoing limitations may include, but are not limited to, failure to consider factors that impact care such as specialty, geographic location, patient mix and demographics, plan design, patient compliance, drug and supply costs, hospital and service costs, professional liability coverage, support staff and other practice costs as well as the potential for mistakes and errors in the data or its attribution. Raw claims and payment data resulting from government health care programs, including, but not limited to, the Medicare and Medicaid programs should only be released: Resolution: 107 (A-23) Page 3 of 5 1. when appropriate patient privacy i s preserved via de -identified data aggregation or if written authorization for release of individually identifiable patient data has been obtained from such patient in accordance with the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and applicable regulations; 2. upon request of physicians [or their practice entities] to the extent the data involve services that they have provided; 3. to law enforcement and other regulatory agencies when there is reasonable and credible reason to believe that a specific physician [or practice entity] may have violated a law or regulation, and the data is relevant to the agency's investigation or prosecution of a possible violation; 4. to researchers/policy analysts for bona fide research/po licy analysis purposes, provided the data do not identify specific physicians [or their practice entities] unless the researcher or policy analyst has (a) made a specific showing as to why the disclosure of specific identities is essential; and, (b) execut ed a written agreement to maintain the confidentiality of any data identifying specific physicians [or their practice entities]; 5. to other entities only if the data do not identify specific physicians [or their practice entities]; or 6. if a law is enact ed that permits the government to release raw physician- specific Medicare and/or Medicaid claims data, or allows the use of such data to construct profiles of identified physicians or physician practices. Such disclosures must meet the following criteria: (a) the publication or release of this information is deemed imperative to safeguard the public welfare; (b) the raw data regarding physician claims from governmental healthcare programs is: (i) published in conjunction with appropriate disclosures and/or explanatory statements as to the limitations of the data that raise the potential for specific misinterpretation of such data. These statements should include disclosure or explanation of factors that influence the provision of care including geographic location, specialty, patient mix and demographics, health plan design, patient compliance, drug and supply costs, hospital and service costs, professional liability coverage, support staff and other practice costs as well as the potential for mistakes and er rors in the data or its attribution, in addition to other relevant factors. (ii) safeguarded to protect against the dissemination of inconsistent, incomplete, invalid or inaccurate physician- specific medical practice data. (c) any physician profiling which draws upon this raw data acknowledges that the data set is not representative of the physicians' entire patient population and uses a methodology that ensures the following: (i) the data are used to profile physicians based on quality of care provided - never on utilization of resources alone - and the degree to which profiling is based on utilization of resources is clearly identified. (ii) data are measured against evidence- based quality of care measures, created by physicians across appropriate specialt ies. (iii) the data and methodologies used in profiling physicians, including the use of representative and statistically valid sample sizes, statistically valid risk- adjustment methodologies and statistically valid attribution rules produce verifiably acc urate results that reflect the quality and cost of care provided by the physicians. (d) any governmental healthcare data shall be protected and shared with physicians before it is released or used, to ensure that physicians are provided with an adequate and timely opportunity to review, respond and appeal the accuracy of the raw data (and its attribution to individual physicians) and any physician profiling results derived from the analysis of physician- specific medical practice data to ensure accuracy prior to their use, publication or release. Citation: BOT Rep. 18, A -09; Reaffirmed: BOT Rep. 09, A -19; Modified: Speakers Rep., A -19; Medical Information and Its Uses H -406.987 DATA TRANSPARENCY PRINCIPLES TO PROMOTE IMPROVEMENTS IN QUALITY AND CARE DELIVERY Our AMA seeks to help physicians improve the quality reporting of patient care data and adapt to new payment and delivery models to transform our health care system. One means of accomplishing this goal is to increase the transparency of health care data. The principles outlined below ensure that physicians, practices, care systems, physician -led organizations, patients and other relevant stakeholders can access and proactively use meaningful, actionable health care information to achieve care improvements and innovations. These principles do not replace but build upon existing AMA policies H -406.990, H -406.989, H-406.991, and H -406.996 that address safeguards for the release of physician data and physician Resolution: 107 (A-23) Page 4 of 5 profiles, expanding these guidelines to reflect th e new opportunities and potential uses of this information. Transparency Objectives and Goals Engaging Physicians - Our AMA encourages greater physician engagement in transparency efforts, including the development of physician- led quality measures to ensure that gaps in measures are minimized and that analyses reflect the knowledge and expertise of physicians. Promoting New Payment and Delivery Models - Our AMA supports appropriate funding and other support to ensure that the data that are used to infor m new payment and delivery models are readily available and do not impose a new cost or additional burden on model participants. Improving Care Choices and Decisions - Our AMA promotes efforts to present data appropriately depending on the objective and t he relevant end- user, including transparently identifying what information is being provided, for what purpose, and how the information can or cannot be used to influence care choices. Informing Physicians - Our AMA encourages the development of user interfaces that allow physicians or their staff to structure simple queries to obtain and track actionable reports related to specific patients, peer comparisons, provider -level resource use, practice patterns, and other relevant information. Informing Patients - Our AMA encourages patients to consult with physicians to understand and navigate health care transparency and data efforts. Informing Other Consumers - Our AMA seeks opportunities to engage with other stakeholders to facilitate physician involvement and more proactive use of health care data. Data Transparency Resources Data Availability - Our AMA supports removing barriers to accessing additional information from other payers and care settings, focusing on data that is valid, reliable, and complet e. Access to Timely Data - While some datasets will require more frequent updates than others, our AMA encourages use of the most current information and that governmental reports are made available, at a minimum, from the previous quarter. Accurate Data - Our AMA supports proper oversight of entities accessing and using health care data, and more stringent safeguards for public reporting, so that information is accurate, transparent, and appropriately used. Use of Quality Data - Our AMA supports definit ions of quality based on evidence- based guidelines, measures developed and supported by specialty societies, and physician- developed metrics that focus on patient outcomes and engagement. Increasing Data Utility - Our AMA promotes efforts by clinical data registries, regional collaborations, Qualified Entities, and specialty societies to develop reliable and valid performance measures, increase data utility and reduce barriers that currently limit access to and use of the health care data. Challenges to T ransparency Standardization - Our AMA supports improvements in electronic health records (EHRs) and other technology to capture and access data in uniform formats. Mitigating Administrative Burden - To reduce burdens, data reporting requirements imposed on physicians should be limited to the information proven to improve clinical practice. Collection, reporting, and review of all other data and information should be voluntary. Data Attribution - Our AMA seeks to ensure that those compiling and using the data avoid attribution Resolution: 107 (A-23) Page 5 of 5 errors by working to correctly assign services and patients to the appropriate provider(s) as well as allowing entities to verify who or where procedures, services, and items were performed, ordered, or otherwise provided. Until problems with the current state of episode of care and attribution methodologies are resolved, our AMA encourages public data and analyses primarily focused at the system- level instead of on individual physicians or providers.

Despite the well documented outcome -based evidence of the 30 benefit of these treatment options, third -party insurers are forcing market consolidation with 31 unsustainable reimbursement models that are below Medicare reimbursement rates; and 32 33 Whereas , Private practices are prohibited from collaborating with each other to request fair 34 reimbursement due to prior anti -trust legal interpretations; and 35 36 Whereas , The future of health care is trending towards the concepts of population health 37 management, outcome evidence- based care, and value- based purchasing of health care. 38 These models favor large groups and hospitals, once again excluding private practice 39 physicians in small and medium -sized groups. The AMA should take steps now to establish 40 Resolution: 108 (A-23) Page 2 of 5 both access to patients and appropriate floors for reimbursement which will address these 1 health care models and their potentially deleterious effects on private practice physicians in 2 small and medium -sized groups going forward; and 3 4 Whereas , In the same way as the U.S. Government has protected individuals through the Fair 5 Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203), which set a minimum wage, and states and 6 municipali ties have enacted similar measures, governments have the authority to establish 7 minimum levels of reimbursement for medical practices; therefore be it 8 9 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association study small medical practices to assess 10 the prevalence of insurance payments to these practices that are below Medicare rates and to 11 assess the effects of these payment levels on practices' ability to provide care, and report back 12 by the 2024 Annual Meeting (Directive to Take Action); and be it further 13 14 RESOLVED, That our AMA study and report back on remedies for such reimbursement rates 15 for physician practices (Directive to Take Action); and be it further 16 17 RESOLVED, That our Council on Medical Service study the impact on small and medium- sized 18 physician practices of being excluded from population health management, outcome evidence- 19 based care, and value- based purchasing arrangements (Directive to Take Action) ; and be it 20 further 21 22 RESOLVED, That our AMA study and report back to the HOD options for model legislation for 23 states and municipalities seeking to correct reimbursement rates for medical practices that are 24 below those required to meet fixed costs.

Citation: Res. 614, I -21; Reaffirmation: A -22; Health System Reform Legislation H -165.838 1. Our American Medical Association is committed to working with Congress, the Administration, and other stakeholders to achieve enactment of health system reforms that include the following seven critical components of AMA policy: a. Health insurance coverage for all Americans b. Insurance market reforms that expand choice of affordable coverage and eliminate denials for pre-Resolution: 108 (A-23) Page 3 of 5 existing conditions or due to arbitrary caps c. Assurance that health care decisions will remain in the hands of patients and their physicians, not insurance companies or government officials d. Investments and incentives for quality improvement and prevention and wellness initiatives e. Repeal of the Medicare physician payment formula that triggers steep cuts and threaten seniors' access to care f. Implementat ion of medical liability reforms to reduce the cost of defensive medicine g. Streamline and standardize insurance claims processing requirements to eliminate unnecessary costs and administrative burdens 2. Our American Medical Association advocates that el imination of denials due to pre- existing conditions is understood to include rescission of insurance coverage for reasons not related to fraudulent representation. 3. Our American Medical Association House of Delegates supports AMA leadership in their unwavering and bold efforts to promote AMA policies for health system reform in the United States. 4. Our American Medical Association supports health system reform alternatives that are consistent with AMA policies concerning pluralism, freedom of choice, freedom of practice, and universal access for patients. 5. AMA policy is that insurance coverage options offered in a health insurance exchange be self - supporting, have uniform solvency requirements; not receive special advantages from government subsidies; i nclude payment rates established through meaningful negotiations and contracts; not require provider participation; and not restrict enrollees' access to out -of-network physicians. 6. Our AMA will actively and publicly support the inclusion in health system reform legislation the right of patients and physicians to privately contract, without penalty to patient or physician. 7. Our AMA will actively and publicly oppose the Independent Medicare Commission (or other similar construct), which would take Medicare payment policy out of the hands of Congress and place it under the control of a group of unelected individuals. 8. Our AMA will actively and publicly oppose, in accordance with AMA policy, inclusion of the following provisions in health system reform legislation: a. Reduced payments to physicians for failing to report quality data when there is evidence that widespread operational problems still have not been corrected by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services b. Medicare payment rate cuts mandat ed by a commission that would create a double- jeopardy situation for physicians who are already subject to an expenditure target and potential payment reductions under the Medicare physician payment system c. Medicare payments cuts for higher utilization w ith no operational mechanism to assure that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services can report accurate information that is properly attributed and risk - adjusted d. Redistributed Medicare payments among providers based on outcomes, quality, and risk -adjustment measurements that are not scientifically valid, verifiable and accurate e. Medicare payment cuts for all physician services to partially offset bonuses from one specialty to another f. Arbitrary restrictions on physicians who refer Medicare pat ients to high quality facilities in which they have an ownership interest 9. Our AMA will continue to actively engage grassroots physicians and physicians in training in collaboration with the state medical and national specialty societies to contact their Members of Congress, and that the grassroots message communicate our AMA's position based on AMA policy. 10. Our AMA will use the most effective media event or campaign to outline what physicians and patients need from health system reform. 11. AMA policy is that national health system reform must include replacing the sustainable growth rate (SGR) with a Medicare physician payment system that automatically keeps pace with the cost of running a practice and is backed by a fair, stable funding formula, and that the AMA initiate a \"call to action\" with the Federation to advance this goal. 12. AMA policy is that creation of a new single payer, government -run health care system is not in the best interest of the country and must not be part of national health s ystem reform. 13. AMA policy is that effective medical liability reform that will significantly lower health care costs by reducing defensive medicine and eliminating unnecessary litigation from the system should be part of any national health system refor m.

Our AMA will proactively engage and advocate with any commercial insurance company that discontinues payment for consultation codes or that is proposing to or considering eliminating payment for such codes, requesting that the company reconsider the policy change. 2. Where a reason given by an insurance company for policy change to discontinue payment of consultation codes includes purported coding errors or abuses, our AMA will request the company carry out coding education and outreach to physicians on consultation codes rather than discontinue payment for the codes, and call for release of de- identified data from the company related to purported coding issues in order to help facilitate potential education by physician societies. Citation: Res. 819, I -17; Reaffirmed in lieu of: Res. 808, I -22; Uncoupling Commercial Fee Schedules from Medicare Conversion Factors D -400.990 Our AMA: (1) shall use every means available to convince health insurance companies and managed care organizations to immediately uncouple fee schedules from Medicare conversion factors and to maintain a fair and appropriate level of reimbursement; and (2) will seek legislation and/or regulation to prevent managed care companies from utilizing a physician payment schedule below the updated Medicare professional fee schedule.

Our AMA adopts as policy the following definitions: (a) \"usual; fee means that fee usually charged, for a given service, by an individual physician to his private patient (i .e., his own usual fee); (b) a fee is 'customary' when it is within the range of usual fees currently charged by physicians of similar training and experience, for the same service within the same specific and limited geographical area; and (c) a fee is 'reasonable' when it meets the above two criteria and is justifiable, considering the special circumstances of the particular case in question, without regard to payments that have been discounted under governmental or private plans. 2. Our AMA takes the p osition that there is no relationship between the Medicare fee schedule and Usual, Customary and Reasonable Fees. Citation: (Res. 109. A -07; Appended: Res. 107, A -13) Physician Choice of Practice H -385.926 Our AMA: (1) encourages the growth and developmen t of the physician/patient contract; (2) supports the freedom of physicians to choose their method of earning a living (fee- for-service, salary, capitation, etc.); (3) supports the right of physicians to charge their patients their usual fee that is fair, irrespective of insurance/coverage arrangements between the patient and the insurers. (This right may be limited by contractual agreement.) An accompanying responsibility of the physician is to provide to the patient adequate fee information prior to the provision of the service. In circumstances where it is not feasible to provide fee information ahead of time, fairness in application of market -based principles demands such fees be subject, upon complaint, to expedited professional review as to appropriateness; and (4) encourages physicians when setting their fees to take into consideration the out -of-pocket expenses paid by patients under a system of individually selected and owned health insurance.

(b) Physicians should continue to volunteer fee inform ation to patients, to discuss fees in advance of service where feasible, to expand the practice of accepting any third party allowances as payment in full in cases of financial hardship, and to communicate voluntarily to their patients their willingness to make appropriate arrangements in cases of financial need. (c) Physicians should have the right to choose the basic mechanism of payment for their services, and specifically to choose whether or not to participate in a particular insurance plan or method of payment, and to accept or decline a third party allowance as payment in full for a service.

Policy G -600.010 reads as follows, laying out the parameters for 3 review an d specifying the procedures to follow: 4 5 1. As the House of Delegates (HOD) adopts policies, a maximum ten -year time horizon shall 6 exist. A policy will typically sunset after 10 years unless action is taken by the HOD to retain 7 it. Any action of our AMA H OD that reaffirms or amends an existing policy position shall 8 reset the sunset \"clock,\" making the reaffirmed or amended policy viable for another 10 years. 9 10 2. In the implementation and ongoing operation of our AMA policy sunset mechanism, the 11 following procedures shall be followed: (a) Each year, the Speakers shall provide a list of 12 policies that are subject to review under the policy sunset mechanism; (b) Such policies shall 13 be assigned to the appropriate AMA councils for review; (c) Each AMA council t hat has been 14 asked to review policies shall develop and submit a report to the HOD identifying policies that 15 are scheduled to sunset; (d) For each policy under review, the reviewing council can 16 recommend one of the following actions: (i) retain the policy; (ii) sunset the policy; (iii) retain 17 part of the policy; or (iv) reconcile the policy with more recent and like policy; (e) For each 18 recommendation that it makes to retain a policy in any fashion, the reviewing council shall 19 provide a succinct, but cogent justification ; or (f) The Speakers shall determine the best way 20 for the HOD to handle the sunset reports. 21 22 3. Nothing in this policy shall prohibit a report to the HOD or resolution to sunset a policy earlier 23 than its 10- year horizon if it is no longer relevant, has been superseded by a more current 24 policy, or has been accomplished. 25 26 4. The AMA councils and the HOD should conform to the following guidelines for sunset: 27 (a) when a policy is no longer relevant or necessary; (b) when a policy or directiv e has been 28 accomplished; or (c) when the policy or directive is part of an established AMA practice that is 29 transparent to the House and codified elsewhere such as the AMA Bylaws or the AMA HOD 30 Reference Manual: Procedures, Policies and Practices. 31 32 5. The most recent policy shall be deemed to supersede contradictory past AMA policies. 33 34 6. Sunset policies will be retained in the AMA historical archives. 35 B of T Rep. 09-A-23 -- page 2 of 37 RECOMMENDATION 1 2 The Board of Trustees recommends that the House of Delegates policies that are listed in the 3 appendix to this report be acted upon in the manner indicated and the remainder of this report be 4 filed. 5 APPENDIX - Recommended Actions Policy Number Title Text Recommendation D-100.970 Drug Enforcement Administration Licensure Fees Our AMA will work through appropriate channels to freeze Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) licensure fees for physicians.

Invasive pain management procedures include interventions throughout the course of diagnosing or treating pain which is chronic, persistent and intractable, or occurs outside of a surgical, obstetrical, or post - operative course of care. Inva sive pain management techniques include: 1. ablation of targeted nerves; 2. procedures involving any portion of the spine, spinal cord, sympathetic nerves or block of major peripheral nerves, including percutaneous precision needle placement within th e spinal column with placement of drugs such as local anesthetics, steroids, and analgesics, in the spinal column under fluoroscopic guidance or any other radiographic or imaging modality; and 3. surgical techniques, such as laser or endoscopic diskectomy, or placement of intrathecal infusion pumps, and/or spinal cord stimulators. At present, invasive pain management procedures do not include major joint injections (except sacroiliac injections), soft tissue injections or epidurals for surgical anesthes ia or labor analgesia. When used for interventional pain management purposes such invasive pain management procedures do not consist solely of administration of anesthesia; rather, they are interactive procedures in which the physician is called upon to make continuing adjustments based on medical inference and judgments. In such instances, it is not the procedure itself, but the purpose and manner in which such procedures are utilized, that demand the ongoing application of direct and immediate medical judgment. These procedures are therefore within the practice of medicine, and should be B of T Rep. 0 9-A-23 -- page 30 of 37 Policy Number Title Text Recommendation performed only by physicians with appropriate training and credentialing. Invasive pain management procedures require physician- level training. However, certain tech nical aspects of invasive pain management procedures may be delegated to appropriately trained, licensed or certified, credentialed non-physicians under direct and/or personal supervision of a physician who possesses appropriate training and privileges in the performance of the procedure being supervised, and in compliance with local, state, and federal regulations.

ACS has changed their B of T Rep. 09-A-23 -- page 33 of 37 Policy Number Title Text Recommendation assistants, provided the surgeon is an active participant throughout the essential part of the operation. Given the nature of the surgical assistant's role and the potential of risk to the public, it is appropriate to ensure that qualified personnel accomplish this function; (3) policy related to surgical assistants consistent with the American College of Surgeons' Statements on Principles states: (a) The surgical assistant is limited to performing specific functions as defined in the medical staff bylaws, rules and regulations. These generally include the following tasks: aid in maintaining adequate exposure in the operating field, cutting suture m aterials, clamping and ligating bleeding vessels, and, in selected instances, actually performing designated parts of a procedure. (b) It is the surgeon 's responsibility to designate the individual most appropriate for this purpose within the bylaws of t he medical staff. The first assistant to the surgeon during a surgical operation should be a credentialed health care professional, preferably a physician, who is capable of participating in the operation, actively assisting the surgeon. (c) Practice priv ileges of individuals acting as surgical assistants should be based upon verified credentials and the supervising physician's capability and competence to supervise such an assistant. Such privileges should be reviewed and approved by the institution's med ical staff credentialing committee and should be within the defined limits of state law. Specifically, surgical assistants must make formal application to the institution's medical staff to function as a surgical assistant under a surgeon's supervision. During the credentialing and privileging of surgical assistants, the medical staff will review and make decisions on the individual's qualifications, experience, credentials, licensure, liability coverage policy related to surgical assistants. B of T Rep. 0 9-A-23 -- page 34 of 37 Policy Number Title Text Recommendation and current competence. (d) If a complex surgical p rocedure requires that the assistant have the skills of a surgeon, the surgical assistant must be a licensed surgeon fully qualified in the specialty area. If a complication requires the skills of a specialty surgeon, or the surgical first assistant is exp ected to take over the surgery, the surgical first assistant must be a licensed surgeon fully qualified in the specialty area. (e) Ideally, the first assistant to the surgeon at the operating table should be a qualified surgeon or resident in an education program that is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and/or the American Osteopathic Association (AOA). Other appropriately credentialed physicians who are experienced in assisting the responsible surgeon may participate when a trained surgeon or a resident in an accredited program is not available. The AMA recognizes that attainment of this ideal in all surgical care settings may not be practicable. In some circumstances it is necessary to utilize appropriately tr ained and credentialed unlicensed physicians and non-physicians to serve as first assistants to qualified surgeons.

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES B of T Report 11-A-23 Subject: HPSA and MUA Designation For SNFs (Resolution by: Sandra Adamson Fryhofer, MD, Chair Referred to: Reference Committee B At the June 2022 Annual Meeting, the House of Delegates referred Resolution 224- A-22, \"HPSA 1 and MUA Designation for SNFs,\" sponsored by the Society for Post -Acute and Long- Term Care 2 Medicine (AMDA). Resolution 224-A-22 asked the American Medical Association (AMA) to 3 advocate for legislative action directing the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) 4 to \"designate all skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), irrespective of their geographic location, as 5 health professional shortage areas (HPSAs) and/or medically underserved areas (MUAs) to 6 facilitate recruitment and retention of health professionals using the usual and customary support 7 made available for such designations.\" 8 9 Testimony regarding this resolution was generally positive, highlighting the benefits of HPSA and 10 MUA designations to areas in need of additional health care resources. Testimony indicated that, 11 due to a rapidly aging population (along with the lack of commensurate increases in medical school 12 and residency positions, early retirement of health care professionals from burnout and the 13 pandemic, and a lack of direct incentives to practice in senior living communities), there is an acute 14 shortage of health care professionals , including physicians, nurses, and clinical practitioners in 15 nursing facilities. Testimony also indicated that the AMA has ample policy that supports legislation 16 to address the need to enhance resources for physicians practicing in rural counties and other areas 17 where the poverty rate exceeds a certain threshold. In addition, testimony stated that AMA policy 18 includes clear instruction for the AMA to support legislation and encourage federal and state 19 governments to provide financial assistance to assist physician practices in shortage areas. Due to 20 the mixed testimony provided, Resolution 224-A-22 was referred. This report focuses on physician 21 shortages in the U.S. and the need to incentivize physicians to practice in nursing facilities and to 22 facilitate recruitment and retention of health professionals in these settings. 23 24 BACKGROUND 25 26 Physician shortage is a significant issue in the U.S. To address this issue, the federal government 27 developed HPSA and MUA designations used to identify areas and population groups that 28 experience physician shortages and to improve access to health care for patients in these areas. It is 29 projected that by 2032 there will be a 50 percent growth in the population of those aged 65 and 30 older, compared with only a 3.5 percent growth for those aged 18 or younger.1 By 2033 it is 31 estimated that there will be a shortage of between 54,100 and 139,000 physicians , which includes a 32 projected primary care physician shortage of between 21,400 and 55,200, as well as a shortage of 33 non-primary care specialty physicians of between 33,700 and 86,700.2 Furthermore, the COVID- 19 34 pandemic put an incredible strain on our health care system and drastically exacerbated physician 35 shortages in many rural and underserved areas across the country, which forced states to take 36 B of T Report 11-A-23 -- page 2 of 6 extraordinary measures such as recall ing retired physicians, expanding scope of practice, and 1 temporarily amend ing out of state licensing laws.3 However, none of these adjustments are 2 expected to permanently fill the physician shortage gap in the long term. 3 4 HEALTH PROFESSIONAL SHORTAGE AREAS AND MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED 5 AREAS 6 7 HPSAs are intended to improve access to health care in areas, population groups, or facilities 8 within the U.S. that experience physician shortages. This designation allows physicians to gain 9 eligibility for financial incentives , such as loan repayment and scholarships, that can help attract 10 and retain physicians in rural and underserved areas , which typically experience physician 11 shortages. However, according to a report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), only 12 about one- third of primary care shortage areas were designated as HPSAs as of 2019.4 13 14 MUAs, like HPSAs, allow physicians to be eligible for financial incentives, such as loan repayment 15 and scholarships, to help attract and retain physicians in shortage areas. In addition, MUAs can 16 increase the availability of primary care services in areas with high poverty rates. Similar to 17 HPSAs, MUAs may not cover all shortage areas and the financial incentives may not be enough to 18 attract and retain physicians. 19 20 ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS 21 22 To provide financial incentives for physicians who work in shortage areas, several programs have 23 been implemented to address the financial burden of medical education, which is a major barrier to 24 physicians choosing to work in shortage areas. In addition, the federal government has 25 implemented several programs to incentivize physicians and other health care providers to work in 26 underserved areas and with underserved populations. 27 28 Incentivizing Physicians and Medical Students 29 30 The National Health Service Corps (NHSC) is a federal program that provides scholarships to 31 medical students starting at the beginning of medical school, and loan repayment post completion 32 of residency training in a primary care specialty, for a minimum of two years commitment work in 33 HPSAs throughout the U nited S tates and U nited S tates territories. The NHSC also has scholarship 34 and loan repayment programs for dentists, nurse practitioners, nurse midwives, and physician 35 assistants. 5 In addition to the NHSC , the Indian Health Service (IHS) is a federal program that 36 provides loan repayment and housing assistance to physicians and other health care providers who 37 work in Indian Health Service facilities. The IHS is intended to improve the health status of 38 American Indian and Alaska Native people by increasing access to health care services.6 39 40 To incentivize medical students, some medical schools offer scholarships to students who commit 41 to working in underserved areas after graduation. For example, the University of Washington 42 School of Medicine offers the WWAMI (Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho) 43 program, which provides scholarships to medical students who commit to certain states that 44 experience physician shortages after graduation. 7 In addition, medical schools may partner with 45 health care facilities in underserved areas to provide clinical experiences for students, which can 46 help attract and retain health care professionals. 47 B of T Report 11-A-23 -- page 3 of 6 J-1 AND H-1B VISAS 1 2 As a strategy to help provide additional physicians, international medical graduates (IMGs) often 3 work in rural and underserved areas.8 In 2017, nearly 30 percent of medical residents were IMGs, 4 with about half working as physicians on non- immigrant visas.9 The AMA recognizes that it is 5 important to support and create pathways for these physicians to be able to remain in the U.S. and 6 care for their patients. 7 8 J-1 visas attract foreign medical graduates with the needed expertise to work in nursing facilities 9 and assisted living facilities where they can help improve the quality of care for patients. By 10 expanding the J-1 visa program to include geriatrics and post- acute and long- term care as 11 designated areas of need, the U.S. can attract more qualified physicians to work in these care 12 settings keeping in mind that J-1 visa programs must have language requirements to ensure that 13 clinicians have a sufficient level of proficiency in English to communicate effectively with patients 14 and other health care workers. 15 16 H-1B visas are a type of temporary work visa that allow foreign workers to enter and work in the 17 U.S. in specialty occupations. In health care, this can include physicians who have completed their 18 medical training outside the U.S. and want to practice in the U.S. H-1B visa programs can be 19 effective in addressing the shortage of qualified clinicians in nursing facilities and assisted living, 20 particularly in underserved areas. 21 22 LOAN FORGIVENESS INCENTIVES 23 24 Loan forgiveness programs can be an effective way to incentivize clinicians to work in nursing 25 facilities. These programs provide financial assistance to clinicians in exchange for a commitment 26 to work in an underserved area. By providing financial incentives, loan forgiveness programs can 27 help address physician shortages in nursing and assisted living facilities . 28 29 AMA POLICY 30 31 AMA policy supports legislation to extend the 10 percent Medicare payment bonus to physicians 32 practicing in rural counties and other areas where the pover ty rate exceeds a certain threshold, 33 regardless of the areas' HPSA status (Policy H-465.981, \"Enhancing Rural Physician Practices\"). 34 The same policy supports legislation that would allow physician practices in shortage areas to 35 qualify as Rural Health Clinics without the need to employ one or more physician extenders and 36 directs the AMA to undertake a study of structural urbanism, federal payment polices, and the 37 impact on rural workforce disparities. This policy recognizes that many rural and low-income areas 38 may have difficulty attracting and retaining physicians with specialized training, including 39 geriatricians, and seeks to address this issue through targeted financial and non- incentives. 40 Additionally, Policy H-200.972, \"Primary Care Physic ians in Underserved Areas\", provides a plan 41 for the AMA to improve the recruitment and retention of physicians in underserved areas with 42 underserved populations and can also help to address the shortage of physicians, including those 43 with geriatrics training, in these areas. 44 45 AMA policy also supports efforts to quantify the geographic maldistribution and physician 46 shortage in many specialties and encourages medical schools and residency programs to consider 47 developing admissions policies , practices, and targeted educational efforts aimed at attracting 48 physicians to practice in shortage areas and to provide care to underserved populations; encourages 49 medical schools and residency programs to continue to provide courses, clerkships, and 50 longitudinal experiences in rural and other shortage areas as a means to support educational 51 B of T Report 11-A-23 -- page 4 of 6 program objectives and to influence the choice of graduates' practice locations; and encourages 1 medical schools to include criteria and processes in the admission of medical students that are 2 predictive of graduates' eventual practice in shortage areas and with underserved populations 3 (Policy H-200.954, \"US Physician Shortage .\") 4 5 AMA policy also supports full appropriation for the NHSC Scholarship Program, with the 6 provision that medical schools serving states with large rural and underserved populations have a 7 priority and significant voice in the selection of recipients for those scholarships (Policy H- 8 465.988, \"Educational Strategies for Meeting Rural Health Physician Shortage .\") 9 DISCUSSION 10 11 The shortage of physicians and other qualified clinicians in skilled nursing facilities and assisted 12 living facilities is a growing problem that has a significant impact on patient care. Patients in these 13 settings often have complex medical needs and require specialized care from physicians with 14 expertise in geriatrics and post -acute and long- term care (PALTC). Increasing the supply of 15 qualified physicians (e.g. geriatricians) to SNFs will help to improve the quality of care provided, 16 decrease medical errors, and improve outcomes as the need for physicians with additional training 17 in geriatrics and PALTC continue s to grow as the population ages. 18 19 Further, i mproving care in underserved areas and populations is a critical issue in our country. 20 However, designating all SNFs, irrespective of their geographic location, as a HPSA or MUA 21 would be a fundamental shift away from viewing geographic areas and populations as a 22 designation criteria to looking at a specific type of facility, including facilities that may be located 23 outside a HPSA/MUA or facilities that are not financially disadvantaged. Also, the goal of the 24 resolution looks beyond facilitating the recruitment and retention of physicians to potentially 25 extend the HPSA/MUA incentive to non- physicians. AMA policy supports a physician- led team 26 with regard to mid -level trained health care workers such as nurse practitioners, nurse midwives, 27 and physician assistants. 28 29 Under the current system, HPSA and MUA designations are a valuable tool for identifying areas 30 with a shortage of physicians and other health care providers, which can help allocate resources to 31 improve access to health care services. Rather than designating a specific type of facility, such as 32 SNFs, they provide a broader framework for addressing health care disparities and physician 33 shortage issues . Regarding scope of practice concerns, SNFs often rely on a team -based approach 34 to care, which include s physicians, nurse practitioners, and other health care professionals. 35 However, without a physician leading the care team, there is a risk that the overall quality of care 36 as well as resident training may suffer. Physicians play a critical role in providing guidance and 37 oversight to the care team, ensuring that residents receive appropriate training and education. In 38 this regard, it is important to note that, to the extent that SNF patients are in a HPSA , MUA, or 39 generally in an underserved area, the AMA already has policy10 in place to incentivize physicians 40 to practice in those areas. 41 42 CONCLUSION 43 44 The Board of Trustees (Board) recognizes that the shortage of physicians in SNFs is a critical issue 45 and shares the goal of ensuring that patients in SNFs receive high- quality care and believes that 46 Resolution 224- A-22 provides another example of how the shortage of physicians is impacting 47 patient access to care, including in SNFs. However, the solution offered in this resolution would 48 fundamentally change how shortage areas and underserved populations are determined and raises 49 scope of practice concerns. As discussed above, the AMA has existing policy that more broadly 50 B of T Report 11-A-23 -- page 5 of 6 addresses the physician shortage issue and can be applied in a way to address the shortage of 1 physicians practicing in SNFs. These policies include efforts to quantify geographic 2 maldistribution, encourage medical schools and residency programs to provide courses and 3 experiences in underserved areas, and support the NHSC Scholarship Program. The Board, 4 therefore, recommend s reaffirmation of existing policy in lieu of adopting Resolution 224-A-22. 5 6 RECOMMENDATIONS 7 8 The Board of Trustees recommends that the following policies be reaffirmed in lieu of Resolution 9 224-A-22, and the remainder of the report be filed: 10 11 1. That our AMA reaffirm Policy H-465.981 , which asks our AMA to: 12 a. support legislation to extend the 10% Medicare payment bonus to physicians practicing in rural 13 counties and other areas where the poverty rate exceeds a certain threshold, regardless of the 14 areas' Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) status; 15 b. encourage federal and state governments to make available low interest loans and other 16 financial assistance to assist physicians with shortage area practices in defraying their costs of 17 compliance with requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 18 Americans with Disabilities Act and other national or state regulatory requirements ; 19 c. explore the feasibility of supporting the legislative and/or regulatory changes necessary to 20 establish a waiver process through which shortage area practices can seek exemption from 21 specific elements of regulatory requirements when improved access, without significant 22 detriment to quality, will result; 23 d. supports legislation that would allow shortage area physicia n practices to qualify as Rural 24 Health Clinics without the need to employ one or more physician extenders; and 25 e. undertake a study of structural urbanism, federal payment polices, and the impact on rural 26 workforce disparities.

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES B of T Report 12 -A-23 Subject: Promoting Proper Oversight and Reimbursement for Specialty Physician Extenders and Non- Physician Practitioners (Resolution 248 -A-22) Presented by: Sandra Adamson Fryhofer, MD, Chair Referred to: Reference Committee B INTRODUCTION 1 2 At the 2022 Annual Meeting, the American Medical Association (AMA) House of Delegates 3 (HOD), referred Resolution 248- A-22 for r eport at the 2023 Annual Meeting. The resolution was 4 introduced by the Organized Medical Staff Section and asks: 5 6 [That] our AMA work with state medical boards to improve oversight and coordination of the 7 work done with physician extenders and non- physician practitioners (Directive to Take 8 Action); and be it further 9 10 That our AMA adopt the position that Boards of Medical Examiners or its equivalent in each 11 state should have oversight of cases involving specialty care as boards with oversight over 12 physician extenders and non- physician practitioners do not have the training to oversee 13 specialty care (New HOD Policy); and be it furthe r 14 15 That our AMA adopt the position that in each state the Board of Medical Examiners or its 16 equivalent should have oversight over physician extenders and non- physician practitioners if 17 billing independently or in independent practice as their respective oversights boards do not 18 have experience providing accurate oversight for specialty care (New HOD Policy). 19 20 The Reference C ommittee heard that our AMA has existing policy and model state legislation that 21 addresses physician supervision of non- physicians, s tate medical board oversight of physician- led 22 teams, and medical board oversight of physician agreements with non- physicians . This policy , and H -360.987, 24 \"Principles Guiding AMA Policy Regarding Supervision of Medical Care Delivered by Advanced 25 Practice Nurses in Integrated Practice,\" not only addresses the first Resolve, but also the sentiment 26 of the entire resolution. Further, t here was overall agreement that the intent of the second Resolve 27 was unclear, yet the Board of Trustees notes that clarification was not provided during testimony. 28 Finally, t he HOD generally supported the concept of the third Resolve but agreed it was too broad 29 as written . The Reference Committee, as a result, recommended that an alternative resolution be 30 adopted in lieu of Resolution 248. The alternative resolution, offered by our AMA Council on 31 Legislation , sought to focus the language , achieve the goal of the third Resolve , and add to existing 32 AMA policy . Due to the complexity of the issue, t he HOD referred Resolution 248 for a report 33 back at the 2023 Annual Meeting. 34 B of T Rep. 12 -A-23 -- page 2 of 4 This report provides background information on the role of health care regulatory boards, including 1 but not limited to state medical boards and boards of nursing. Moreover, this report discusses 2 current state laws allowing for joint oversight of certified nurse practitioners and certified nurse 3 midwives by the state boards of medicine and nursing. This report also includes a summary of 4 AMA policy and model state legislation that supports joint regulatory board oversight of advanced 5 practice registered nurses (APRNs) . Finally, this report recommends reaffirmation of existing 6 AMA Policy , H-35.965, \"Regulation of Physician Assistants,\" as well as an amendment to 7 AMA Policy H -360.987, \" Principles Guiding AMA Policy Regarding Supervision of Medical Care 8 Delivered by Advanced Practice Nurses in Integrated Practice\" by addition and deletion. 9 10 BACKGROUND 11 12 The r ole of occupational boards 13 14 The licensing and regulation of health care professionals is within the purview of state occupational 15 and regulatory boards . Health care professional regulatory boards ensure that only i ndividuals 16 meeting the minimal qualifications and competencies can obtain a license to practice in the 17 profession. Typically state legislatures or regulatory boards set forth the standards required to 18 obtain a license, such as graduation from an accredited educational program and the requisite 19 degree, certification, passage of a professional examination, and completion of a background 20 check. These measures are in place to protect the public from unqualified health care professionals 21 through licensure. Regul atory boards also ensure t hat the health care professionals whom they 22 license practice within the applicable standard (s) of care and the scope of practice of their 23 profession. As such, regulatory boards also have the authority to investigate and discipline their 24 licensees who fail to meet these standards. 25 26 The role of medical boards 27 28 The primary role of a state medical board is to protect the health and safety of the public by 29 licensing physicians, investigating complaints, and disciplining physicians based on the state 30 medical practice act. There are currently 71 state and territorial medical boards, including more 31 than 50 allopathic (MD) and composite (MD and DO) medical boards and 14 osteopathic (DO) 32 boards. In addition to licensing physicians, state medical boards also license several non- 33 physicians, such as physician assistants, podiatrists, chiropractors, respiratory therapists, 34 occupational therapists, geneti c counselors, radiologist assistants, certified anesthesiologist 35 assistants, naturopaths, and acupuncturists . The types of non- physicians licensed and regulated by 36 state medical boards varies widely by state. 37 38 Regulatory oversight of non- physicians 39 40 Non-physicians may be regulated directly by a state medical board, through an advisory committee 41 to a state medical board, or by an entirely separate licensing board. For example, while physician 42 assistants are licensed and regulated by the board of medicine in most states, a few states have a 43 separate physician assistant licensing board , and some states have a physician assistant advisory 44 committee under the board of medicine. Similarly, naturopaths are typically licensed by a separate 45 naturopathic board or the board of medicine in states that license naturopaths . Likewise, 46 acupuncturists may be licensed by the board of medicine or a separate board of acupuncture. In 47 contrast , in most states, psychologists are licensed and regulated by a separate board of psy chology, 48 and pharmacists are licensed by the board of pharmacy in each state. 49 B of T Rep. 12 -A-23 -- page 3 of 4 In most states, c ertified nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives, certified registered nurse 1 anesthetists, and clinical nurse specialists, often referred to collectively as \"Advanced Practice 2 Registered Nurses\" (APRN s) are licensed and regulated exclusively by the board of nursing. Every 3 state has at least one nursing regulatory board and four states (California, Georgia, Louisiana and 4 West Virginia) have two nursing boards: one that regulates registered nurses and one that regulates 5 licensed practical nurses and vocational nurses. At least one state, Nebraska, has a board for 6 registered nurses and a separate board for APRNs . Certified nurse midwives, a type of APRN, are 7 regulated by the board of nursing in most states. At least one state , however, has a separate 8 midwifery board responsible for regulating certified nurse midwives and certified professional 9 midwives. In other states , certified nurse midwives may be regulated by the board of medicine or 10 public health, often with a midwifery advisory committee or council . 11 12 Similarly , in several states the board of medicine and board of nursing have joint regulation of 13 nurse practitioners and other types of APRNs. For example, i n Virginia, nurse practitioners are 14 jointly licensed by the Virginia Board s of Medicine and Nursing. Other states have created a 15 separate joint board for regulatory oversight of nurse practitioners practicing independently . For 16 example, in Arkansas, the Full Independent Credentialing Committee (committee) located in the 17 Department of Health, reviews and approves all applications for nurse practitioners who have met 18 the standards for independent practice and apply for a certificate of full independent practice 19 authority. The committee is comprised of four physicians and four nurse practitioners . In addition 20 to approving or denying all applications , the committee is also responsible for reviewing 21 complaint s against nurse practitioners who have a certificate. Finally, in several states , the boards 22 of medicine and nursing have joint oversight of some aspect of advanced practice registered 23 nursing. For example, the Alabama Board of Medical Examiners and Board of Nursing jointly 24 approve collaborative practice agreements between physicians and certified nurse midwives or 25 physicians and certified nurse practitioners. 26 27 EXISTING AMA MODEL STATE LEGISLATION AND POLICY 28 29 AMA model state legislation 30 31 The AMA's \"Model Act to Support Physician -Led Team Based Health Care \" (Model Act) includes 32 a provision stating that APRNs shall be jointly licensed and regulated by the state b oard of 33 medicine and board of nursing. The M odel Act provides a joint regulatory framework and practice 34 parameters including a requirement that the APRN practice as part of a physician -led patient care 35 team . 36 37 AMA policy 38 39 The AMA also has existing P olicy H-35.965, \" Regulation of Physician Assistants ,\" that supports 40 the \" authority of medical licensing and regulatory boards to regulate the practice of medicine 41 through oversight of physicians, physician assistants and related medical personnel \" and \"opposes 42 legislative efforts to establish autonomous regulatory boards meant to license, r egulate and 43 discipline physician assistants outside of the existing state medical licensing and regulatory bodies ' 44 authority and purview .\" AMA P olicy H -35.989, \"Physician Assistants ,\" indicates that state medical 45 boards shall approve physician assistant applications to practice with a licensed physician or group 46 of physicians and provides parameters for such application s. AMA P olicy H-360.987, \" Principles 47 Guiding AMA Policy Regarding Supervision of Medical Care Delivered by Advanced Practice 48 Nurses in Integ rated Practice,\" states in part that \" [p]hysicians should encourage state medical and 49 nursing boards to explore the feasibility of working together to coordinate their regulatory 50 initiatives and activities. \" 51 B of T Rep. 12 -A-23 -- page 4 of 4 DISCUSSION 1 2 Our AMA has existing policy, H-35.965, \"Regulation of Physician Assistants,\" and H-35.989, 3 \"Physician Assistants,\" supporting the licensure and regulatory oversight of physician assistants by 4 state medical boards. Th ese two polic ies support the current regulatory structure in most states, are 5 aligned with AMA's scope of practice advocacy, and address the sentiment of Resolution 248.Our 6 AMA also has policy encouraging state medical and nursing boards to explore working together to 7 coordinate their regulatory activities , H-360.987, \"Principles Guiding AMA Policy Regarding 8 Supervision of Medical Care Delivered by Advanced Practice Nurses in Integrated Practice.\" 9 While this language provides the basis for a joint state medical and nursing board regulatory 10 model, the Board of Trustees believes these policies should be strengthened to affirmatively 11 support joint state medical and nursing board licensing and regulatory oversight of certified nurse 12 practitioners, certified registered nurse anesthetists, certified nurse midwives, and clinical nurse 13 specialists, when appropriate . The Board of Trustees believes the proffered amendment provides 14 clarity as to the appropriate role of state medical boards in regulating the practice of APRNs 15 seeking scope expansions . 16 17 As discussed above, there is precedent in state law for joint state medical and nursing board 18 regulatory oversight of APRNs. Moreover, AMA's Model Act also includes language supporting a 19 joint medical and nursing board regulatory structure . The AMA will continue to work with state, 20 specialty and national medical societies interested in pursuing AMA's Model Act. 21 22 RECOMMENDATIONS 23 24 The Board of Trustees r ecommends that the following recommendations be adopted in lieu of 25 Resolution 248-A-22 and that the remainder of the report be filed. 26 27 1. That our American Medical Association (AMA) reaffirm existing Policy H-35.965, 28 \"Regulation of Physician Assistants,\" and H-35.989, \"Physician Assistants.\" (Reaffirm 29 HOD Policy) 30 31 2. That Policy H-360.987, \"Principles Guiding AMA Policy Regarding Supervision of 32 Medical Care Delivered by Advanced Practice Nurses in Integrated Practice\" be amended 33 by addition and deletion as follows: 34 35 (5) Physicians should encourage Certified nurse practitioners, certified registered nurse 36 anesthetists, certified nurse midwives, and clinical nurse specialists shall be licensed and 37 regulated jointly by the state medical and nursing boards explore the feasibility of working 38 together to c oordinate their regulatory initiatives and activities .

AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 201 (A-23) Introduced by: American Association of Clinical Urologists, American Urological Association Subject: Pharmacists Prescribing for Urinary Tract Infections Referred to: Reference Committee B Whereas, American Medical Association Policy D- 35.987 Evaluation of the Expanding Scope of 1 Pharmacist's Practice opposes federal and state legislation allowing pharmacists to 2 independently prescribe or dispense prescription medication without a valid order by, or under 3 supervision of a licensed doctor of medicine, osteopathy, dentistry or podiat ry; and 4 5 Whereas, In 2022/2023 several states including Virginia, Oklahoma, Connecticut, Mississippi, 6 New Mexico and Montana introduced bills to their state legislatures allowing pharmacists to 7 order, test, screen, and treat many health conditions including urinary tract infections; and 8 9 Whereas, The diagnosis of urinary tract infections can be extremely nuanced and is one of the 10 most erroneously diagnosed conditions for which physicians are consulted; and 11 12 Whereas, Underdiagnosis of the severity of urinary tract infections may miss important 13 associated clinical situations such as: kidney or ureteral stones, ureteropelvic junction 14 obstruction, malignant obstruction, etc., which can lead to urinary sepsis and death ; and 15 16 Whereas, Misdiagnosis of genitourinary symptoms such as dysuria, pain, or blood in the urine 17 as a common urinary tract infection may miss non- infectious conditions such as interstitial 18 cystitis, overactive bladder, neurogenic bladder, multiple sclerosis, cancer, etc. ; and 19 20 Whereas, Phar macists may not recognize clinical symptoms indicating the presence of foreign 21 bodies within the urinary system, infectious stones, urinary fistulae or diverticula, etc. ; and 22 23 Whereas, Urinary tract infections are also one of the most significant sources of antibiotic 24 resistance due to inappropriately prescribed antibiotics. The inability to follow resistance 25 patterns and trends in laboratory results impairs the ability of pharmacists to appropriately 26 prescribe antibiotics ; and 27 28 Whereas, AUA guidelines rec ommend treating urinary tract infections based on a complete 29 patient evaluation including history, pertinent physical examination, appropriate laboratory 30 evaluation and physician follow -up; and 31 32 Whereas, Physicians possess the knowledge, training, experience, and tools to responsibly 33 prescribe antibiotics for urinary tract infections without adding to the ongoing issue of bacterial 34 resistance; therefore be it 35 36 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association collaborate with relevant stakeholders 37 including state and specialty societies to oppose legislation or regulation allowing pharmacists 38 to test, diagnose, and treat urinary tract infections (Directive to T ake Action); and be it further 39 Resolution: 201 (A-23) Page 2 of 2 RESOLVED, That our AMA advocate that inappropriate treatment of urinary tract infections with 1 antibiotics is a public health concern which can lead to further bacterial antibiotic resistance . 2 (Directive to T ake Action) 3 Fiscal Note: Modest - between $1,000 - $5,000 Received: 3/14/23 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 202 (A-23) Introduced by: Medical Student Section Subject: Support for Mental Health Courts Referred to: Reference Committee B Whereas, \"Mental health courts\" are correctional diversion and rehabilitation programs used by 1 state and local courts to support individuals with mental illness in the justice system1-7; and 2 3 Whereas, Mental health courts connect individuals with mental illness to mental health 4 treatment, as an alternative to incarceration or other legal sentences and penalties1-7; and 5 6 Whereas, Two pieces of federal Congressional legislation, the America's Law Enforcement and 7 Mental Health Project of 2000 and the Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act 8 of 2004 (MIOTCRA), were enacted to improve the use of mental health personnel and 9 resources in the justice system and to establish grants to fund mental health court programs8-9; 10 and 11 12 Whereas, The continued funding of MIOTCRA programs over the last two decades has been 13 dependent on Congressional appropriations10; and 14 15 Whereas, The US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in 16 the Department of Health and Human Services and the US Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) 17 in the Department of Justice administer grants to fund state and local mental health courts11,12; 18 and 19 20 Whereas, Research demonstrates that mental health courts appear to be associated with 21 reductions in recidivism, length of incarceration, severity of charges, risk of violence, and 22 rehospitalization among individuals with mental illness in the justice system3,13- 26; and 23 24 Whereas, SAMHSA published a 2015 report noting that because \"the vast majority of individuals 25 who come into contact with the criminal justice system appear\" before municipal courts and 26 \"many of these individuals have mental illness and co- occurring substance use disorders,\" 27 municipal courts may be an especially effective \"and often overlooked\" method of diversion of 28 individuals with mental illness from the justice system26; and 29 30 Whereas, In addition to SAMHSA and BJA, several nonprofit advocacy organizations, including 31 Mental Health America, the National Alliance on Mental Illness, the Treatment Advocacy Center, 32 the National Sheriffs' Association, the Council on State Governments, and the National Center 33 for State Courts, support the use of mental health courts2,27- 32; and 34 35 Whereas, While several hundred mental health courts exist across all 50 states, mental health 36 courts do not exist in all counties and localities, indicating that these programs may not be 37 accessible or available to all individuals who could benefit from them4; and 38 Resolution: 202 (A-23) Page 2 of 7 Whereas, Because mental health courts are dependent on participation from national, state, and 1 local governmental agencies, justice systems, and mental health service organizations and on 2 the appropriation of public funds, including federal monies for MIOTCRA programs and grants 3 administered by SAMHSA and BJA10-12, the AMA can play a role in advocating for the continued 4 support and funding of mental health courts by policymakers; and 5 6 Whereas, Courts that connect individuals with mental illness to treatment as an alternative to 7 incarceration exist under many different names, with each focused on different types of mental 8 illness, including \"mental health courts\" (for mental illness in general), \"drug courts\" (for 9 substance use disorders), and \"sobriety\" or \"sober courts\" (for alcohol use disorder and 10 sometimes certain other substance use disorders)32-35; and AMA policy should be inclusive of all 11 these different types; and 12 13 Whereas, Existing AMA Policy H -100.955 (passed at A- 12) established support for drug courts, 14 which are similar in function to mental health courts but narrower in scope, \"for individuals with 15 addictive disease who are convicted of nonviolent crimes\"; and 16 17 Whereas, Existing AMA Policy H -510.979 (passed at I -19) established support for veteran 18 courts, which are similar in function to mental health courts but narrower in scope, \"for veterans 19 who commit criminal offenses that may be related to a neurological or psychiatric disorder\"; and 20 21 Whereas, At I -19, HOD Reference Committee B originally recommended amending Resolution 22 202 on veteran courts to limit their use to only nonviolent offenses, to be consistent with 23 previous Policy H -100.955 on drug courts36-37; and 24 25 Whereas, At I -19, despite the Reference Committee B recommendation, Resolution 202 was 26 extracted in our HOD to remove the restriction on only using veteran courts for nonviolent 27 offenses, and our HOD ultimately passed Policy H -510.979 such that veteran courts could 28 potentially be used for criminal offenses in general and not only for nonviolent offenses36; and 29 30 Whereas, To be consistent with our HOD's most recent debate on this matter, Policy H- 100.955 31 on drug courts and any future AMA policy on alternatives to incarceration for individuals with 32 mental illness should not be limited to only nonviolent offenses; therefore be it 33 34 RESOLVED, That American Medical Association Policy H- 100.955, Support for Drug Courts, be 35 amended by addition and deletion as follows: 36 37 Support for Mental Health Drug Courts, H -100.955 38 Our AMA: (1) supports the establishment an d use of mental health 39 drug courts , including drug courts and sobriety courts, as an effective 40 method of intervention within a comprehensive system of community - 41 based supports and services for in dividuals with mental illness 42 involved in the justice system addictive disease who are convicted of 43 nonviolent crimes ; (2) encourages legislators to establish mental 44 health drug courts at the state and local level in the United States; 45 and (3) encourages m ental health drug courts to rely upon evidence- 46 based models of care for those who the judge or court determine 47 would benefit from intervention rather than incarceration.

RELEVANT AMA POLICY Support for Drug Courts H -100.955 Our AMA: (1) supports the establishment of drug courts as an effective method of intervention for individuals with addictive disease who are convicted of nonviolent crimes; (2) encourages legislators t o establish drug courts at the state and local level in the United States; and (3) encourages drug courts to rely upon evidence- based models of care for those who the judge or court determine would benefit from intervention rather than incarceration. Citation: Res. 201, A -12; Appended: BOT Rep. 09, I -19; Support for Veterans Courts H -510.979 Our AMA supports the use of Veterans Courts as a method of intervention for veterans who commit criminal offenses that may be related to a neurological or psychiatric disorder. Citation: Res. 202, I -19; Maintaining Mental Health Services by States H -345.975 Our AMA: 1. supports maintaining essential mental health services at the state level, to include maintaining state inpatient and outpatient mental hospitals, community mental health centers, addiction treatment centers, and other state- supported psychiatric services; 2. supports state responsibility to develop programs that rapidly identify and refer individuals with significant mental illness for treatment, to avoid repeated psychiatric hospitalizations and repeated interactions with the law, primarily as a result of untreated mental conditions; 3. supports increased funding for state Mobile Crisis Teams to locate and treat homeless individuals with mental illness; 4. supports enforcement of the Mental Health Parity Act at the federal and state level; and 5. will take these resolves into consideration when developing policy on essential benefit services. Citation: Res. 116, A -12; Reaffirmation A -15; Reaffirmed: Res. 414, A -22; AMA Support for Justice Reinvestment Initiatives H -95.931 Our AMA supports justice reinvestment initiatives aimed at improving risk assessment tools for screening and assessing individuals for substance use disorders and mental health issues, expanding jail diversion and jail alternative programs, and increasing access to reentry and treatment programs. Citation: Res. 205, A -16; Resolution: 202 (A-23) Page 5 of 7 Prevention of Impaired Driving H -30.936 Our AMA: (1) acknowledges that all alcohol consumption, even at low levels, has a negative impact on driver skills, perceptions, abilities, and performance and poses significant health and safety risks; (2) supports 0.04 percent blood- alcohol level as per se illegal for driving, and urges incorporation of that provisio n in all state drunk driving laws; and (3) supports 21 as the legal drinking age, strong penalties for providing alcohol to persons younger than 21, and stronger penalties for providing alcohol to drivers younger than 21. Education: Our AMA: (1) favors public information and education against any drinking by drivers; (2) supports efforts to educate physicians, the public, and policy makers about this issue and urges national, state, and local medical associations and societies, together with public health, transportation safety, insurance, and alcohol beverage industry professionals to renew and strengthen their commitment to preventing alcohol -impaired driving; (3) encourages physicians to participate in educating patients and the public about the hazards of chemically impaired driving; (4) urges public education messages that now use the phrase \"drunk driving,\" or make reference to the amount one might drink without fear of arrest, be replaced with messages that indicate that \"all alcohol use, even at low levels, impairs driving performance and poses significant health and safety risks;\" (5) encourages state medical associations to participate in educational activities related to eliminating alcohol use by adolescents; and (6) supports and encourages progr ams in elementary, middle, and secondary schools, which provide information on the dangers of driving while under the influence of alcohol, and which emphasize that teenagers who drive should drink no alcoholic beverages whatsoever; and will continue to work with private and civic groups such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) to achieve those goals. Legislation: Our AMA: (1) supports the development of model legislation which would provide for school education programs to teach adolescents about the dangers of drinking and driving and which would mandate the following penalties when a driver under age 21 drives with any blood alcohol level (except for minimal blood alcohol levels, such as less than .02 percent, only from medications or religious pract ices): (a) for the first offense - mandatory revocation of the driver's license for one year and (b) for the second offense - mandatory revocation of the driver's license for two years or until age 21, whichever is greater; (2) urges state medical associat ions to seek enactment of the legislation in their legislatures; (3) urges all states to pass legislation mandating all drivers convicted of first and multiple DUI offenses be screened for alcoholism and provided with referral and treatment when indicated; (4) urges adoption by all states of legislation calling for administrative suspension or revocation of driver licenses after conviction for driving under the influence, and mandatory revocation after a specified number of repeat offenses; and (5) encourag es passage of state traffic safety legislation that mandates screening for substance use disorder for all DUI offenders, with those who are identified with substance use disorder being strongly encouraged and assisted in obtaining treatment from qualified physicians and through state and medically certified facilities. Treatment: Our AMA: (1) encourages that treatment of all convicted DUI offenders, when medically indicated, be mandated and provided but in the case of first -time DUI convictions, should not replace other sanctions which courts may levy in such a way as to remove from the record the occurrence of that offense; and (2) encourages that treatment of repeat DUI offenders, when medically indicated, be mandated and provided but should not replace other sanctions which courts may levy. In all cases where treatment is provided to a DUI offender, it is also recommended that appropriate adjunct services should be provided to or encouraged among the family members actively involved in the offender's life; Repeat Offenders: Our AMA: (1) recommends the following measures be taken to reduce repeat DUI offenses: (a) aggressive measures be applied to first -time DUI offenders (e.g., license suspension and administrative license revocation), (b) stronger penalt ies be leveled against repeat offenders, including second- time offenders, (c) such legal sanctions must be linked, for all offenders, to substance abuse assessment and treatment services, to prevent future deaths in alcohol -related crashes and multiple DUI offenses; and (2) calls upon the states to coordinate law enforcement, court system, and motor vehicle departments to implement forceful and swift penalties for second- time DUI convictions to send the message that those who drink and drive might receive a second chance but not a third. On-board devices: Our AMA: (1) supports further testing of on- board devices to prevent the use of motor vehicles by intoxicated drivers; this testing should take place among the general population of drivers, as well as among drivers having alcohol -related problems; (2) encourages motor vehicle manufacturers and the U.S. Department of Transportation to monitor the development of ignition interlock technology, and plan for use of such systems by the general population, when a consensus of informed persons and studies in the scientific literature indicate the systems are effective, acceptable, reasonable in cost, and Resolution: 202 (A-23) Page 6 of 7 safe; and (3) supports continued research and testing of devices which may incapacitate vehicles owned or operated by DUI offenders without needlessly penalizing the offender's family members. Citation: (CCB/CLRPD Rep. 3, A -14) E-9.7.2 Court -Initiated Medical Treatment in Criminal Cases Court -initiated medical treatments raise important questions as to the rights of prisoners, the powers of judges, and the ethical obligations of physicians. Although convicted criminals have fewer rights and protections than other citizens, being convicted of a crime does not deprive an offender of all protections under the law. Court -ordered medical treatments raise the question whether professional ethics permits physicians to cooperate in administering and overseeing such treatment. Physicians have civic duties, but medical ethics do not require a physician to carry out civic duties that contradict fundamental principles of medical ethics, such as the duty to avoid doing harm. In limited circumstances physicians can ethically participate in court -initiated medical treatments. Individual physicians who provide care under court order should: (a) Participate only if the procedure being mandated is therapeutically efficacious and is therefore undoubtedly not a form of punishment or solely a mechanism of social control. (b) Treat patients based on sound medical diagnoses, not cour t-defined behaviors. While a court has the authority to identify criminal behavior, a court does not have the ability to make a medical diagnosis or to determine the type of treatment that will be administered. When the treatment involves in- patient therapy, surgical intervention, or pharmacological treatment, the physician's diagnosis must be confirmed by an independent physician or a panel of physicians not responsible to the state. A second opinion is not necessary in cases of court -ordered counseling or referrals for psychiatric evaluations. (c) Decline to provide treatment that is not scientifically validated and consistent with nationally accepted guidelines for clinical practice. (d) Be able to conclude, in good conscience and to the best of his or her professional judgment, that to the extent possible the patient voluntarily gave his or her informed consent, recognizing that an element of coercion that is inevitably present. When treatment involves in- patient therapy, surgical intervention, or pharmac ological treatment, an independent physician or a panel of physicians not responsible to the state should confirm that voluntary consent was given. Issued: 2016 E-2.1.2 Decisions for Adult Patients Who Lack Capacity Respect for patient autonomy is central to professional ethics and physicians should involve patients in health care decisions commensurate with the patient's decision- making capacity. Even when a medical condition or disorder impairs a patient's decision- making capacity, the patient may still be able to participate in some aspects of decision making. Physicians should engage patients whose capacity is impaired in decisions involving their own care to the greatest extent possible, including when the patient has previously designated a surrogate to make decisions on his or her behalf. When a patient lacks decision- making capacity, the physician has an ethical responsibility to: (a) Identify an appropriate surrogate to make decisions on the patient's behalf: (i) the person the patient designated as surrogate through a durable power of attorney for health care or other mechanism; or (ii) a family member or other intimate associate, in keeping with applicable law and policy if the patient has not previously designated a surrogate. (b) Recognize that the patient's surrogate is entitled to the same respect as the patient. (c) Provide advice, guidance, and support to the surrogate. (d) Assist the surrogate to make decisions in keeping with the standard of substituted judgment, basing decisions on: (i) the patient's preferences (if any) as expressed in an advance directive or as documented in the medical record; (ii) the patient's views about life and how it should be lived; (iii) how the patient constructed his or her life story; and (iv) the patient's attitudes toward sickness, suffering, and certain medical procedures. (e) Assist the surrogate to make decisions in keeping with the best interest standard when the patient's preferences and values are not known and cannot reasonably be inferred, such as when the patient has not previously expressed preferences or has never had decision- making capacity. Best interest decisions should be based on: (i) the pain and suffering associated with the intervention; Resolution: 202 (A-23) Page 7 of 7 (ii) the degree of and potential for benefit; (iii) impairments that may result from the intervention; (iv) quality of life as experienced by the patient. (f) Consult an ethics committee or other institutional resource when: (i) no surrogate is available or there is ongoing disagreement about who is the appropriate surrogate; (ii) ongoing disagreement about a treatment decision cannot be resolved; or (iii) the physician judges that the surrogate's decision: a. is clearly not what the patient would have decided when the patient's preferences are known or can be inferred; b. could not reasonably be judged to be in the patient's best interest; or c. primarily serves the interests of the surrogate or other third party rather than the patient. Issued: 2016 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 203 (A-23) Introduced by: Medical Student Section Subject: Drug Policy Reform Referred to: Reference Committee B Whereas, In 2019, 197.5 million Americans (71.8%) aged 12 and over used a substance in 1 the past year, with 179 million using alcohol, 72 million using tobacco, and 57.2 million using 2 an illicit drug, including 9.7 million using prescription opioids, 6 million using hallucinogens, 3 5.9 million using prescription tranquilizers or stimulants, 5.5 million using cocaine, 2 million 4 using methamphetamine, and 745,000 using heroin1; and 5 6 Whereas, In 2019, 20.4 million Americans (9.7% of those who used a substance in the past 7 year) aged 12 and over met substance use disorder (SUD) criteria, including 14.5 million 8 Americans with alcohol use disorder and 8.3 million with an SUD involving an illicit drug1; and 9 10 Whereas, The US classifies controlled substances into five schedules, but significant 11 controversy exists over the schedules of certain drugs deemed to have \"no medical use,\" 12 despite research showing that these drugs may have therapeutic potential2-5; and 13 14 Whereas, Sentences and penalties for federal and state drug offenses vary depending on the 15 drug's schedule, amount of drug, circumstances of arrest, and previous drug convictions and 16 criminal record6-8; and 17 18 Whereas, Drug possession is defined as being found with an amount of a drug small enough 19 for personal use (as determined by the government) without legal justification6-8; and 20 21 Whereas, Under federal statute, drug possession is classified as a criminal misdemeanor and 22 can be punishable by up to 1 year imprisonment and/or at least $1,000 in fines for a first -time 23 offense and up to 3 years imprisonment and/or $5,000 in fines for repeat offenses, with 24 greater sentences and penalties depending on amount of drug, previous drug convictions, 25 and criminal record7-8; and 26 27 Whereas, State statutes are most commonly used to charge people with drug possession 28 and these statutes vary significantly, with many states (including Indiana, Kentucky, and 29 Oklahoma) reclassifying possession from felonies to misdemeanors over the last decade, 30 lowering mandatory minimums, and using savings from reduced incarceration to fund social 31 services, while many other states (such as Idaho, Missouri, and Nebraska) continue to 32 charge possession as felonies often punished with multiple years of imprisonment9-13; and 33 34 Whereas, In some states, multiple drug felony convictions can result in being charged with a 35 \"violent offense,\" despite no physical violence being committed against any person, which 36 can further increase sentences and penalties and limit eligibility for parole14; and 37 38 Whereas, Drug possession arrests comprise 10% of all arrests in the US and make up over 39 80% of all drug offense arrests, and possession arrests drastically increased alongside 40 Resolution: 203 (A-23) Page 2 of 9 changing policies of the War on Drugs from 538,100 in 1982 to over 1.4 million in 2018, even 1 as arrests for drug distribution and manufacture remained relatively stable since 199015-16; 2 and 3 4 Whereas, Of the 2.3 million people incarcerated in the US, 450,000 (20%) are incarcerated 5 for \"nonviolent drug offenses,\" including 120,000 unconvicted awaiting trial16; and 6 7 Whereas, Defelonization refers to the reclassification of an offense from a felony to a 8 misdemeanor, reduces the probability and potential length of imprisonment and decreasing 9 the long- term harms associated with incarceration17-19; and 10 11 Whereas, \"Decriminalization\" is distinct from legalization and only refers to the removal of 12 crimi nal charges associated with drug possession and its reclassification as a civil infraction, 13 which is a prohibited action that results in civil penalties and sanctions against a person17-20; 14 and 15 16 Whereas, \"Legalization\" would move beyond decriminalization by eliminating civil infractions 17 for drug possession and creating a regulatory system to control legal production and sale of 18 drugs to adults without a prescription, as with alcohol and tobacco17-20; and 19 20 Whereas, AMA Policy H -95.924, \"Cannabis Legalization for Adult Use,\" states that our AMA 21 \"supports public health based strategies, rather than incarceration,\" and the AMA Council on 22 Science & Public Health's Interim 2020 report on cannabis states that \"AMA policy supports 23 decriminalization of cannabis (i.e. , reduction in the penalty associated with possession of a 24 small amount of cannabis from a criminal offense subject to arrest to a civil infraction)\"21; and 25 26 Whereas, Various states are considering policies to expunge (destroy) certain offenses (such 27 as dr ug offenses, especially those due to cannabis) from a person's criminal record after 28 completion of sentences and penalties, but expungement processes can still be costly and 29 complicated, hindering eligible people from applying (for example, expungement in Missouri 30 costs $250)22-26; and 31 32 Whereas, The Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment & Expungement Act, which was passed 33 by the US House of Representatives in December 2020 but has not yet been considered in 34 the Senate, contains language to \"create an automatic process, at no cost to the individual, 35 for the expungement, destruction, or sealing of criminal records for cannabis offenses; 36 and...eliminate violations or other penalties for persons under parole, probation, pre- trial, or 37 other State or local criminal s upervision for a cannabis offense\"27-28; and 38 39 Whereas, The US Department of Health & Human Services' Healthy People 2020 initiative 40 considers incarceration a key issue within the broad category of social determinants of 41 health, due to poor physical and mental health outcomes and cross -generational effects on 42 the children of those incarcerated, with evidence demonstrating the disproportionate impact 43 of the \"War on Drugs\" on minoritized communities29-31; and 44 45 Whereas, While only 5% of people who use drugs are Black, arrests of Black people 46 comprise nearly 30% of all drug arrests, and Black people are nearly six times more likely to 47 be arrested for a drug offense than a white person, even when controlling for differences in 48 drug use, exacerbating racial injustice32,33; and 49 Resolution: 203 (A-23) Page 3 of 9 Whereas, Research shows that incarceration is ineffective and does not significantly reduce 1 recidivism, drug use, drug overdose deaths, or drug arrests, with a 2013 Washington state 2 study finding that overdose was the leading cause of death for people previously 3 incarcerated34-36; and 4 5 Whereas , Drug criminalization is associated with increased stigma and discrimination against 6 people who use drugs, impairing their mental and physical health and hindering treatment 7 efforts; has fueled the growth of illegal markets, organized crime, and violent injuries; and 8 detrimentally affected public health by increasing overdose deaths due to drug contamination 9 and spreading HIV and hepatitis C37-41; and 10 11 Whereas, Previous incarceration of people who use drugs is associated with lack of access to 12 health insurance, even after the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, while possession 13 arrests, regardless of conviction, can negatively impact employment, housing, and student 14 loan eligibility, leading to widespread and multifactorial health consequences42-44; and 15 16 Whereas, Drug felony convictions can lead to lifelong bans from receiving government 17 assistance (such as SNAP and TANF), employment and housing discrimination, and loss of 18 the right to vote or serve on a jury7,45- 48; and 19 20 Whereas, People who are incarcerated are at higher risk of chronic conditions such as 21 cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and cancer compared to the general population, with 22 an important 2013 New York state study finding that each year spent in prison corresponded 23 with a two -year d ecline in life expectancy49,50; and 24 25 Whereas, Drug criminalization is costly, ineffective, and stigmatizing, exposing people to 26 incarceration, encouraging more dangerous drug consumption methods, and discouraging 27 people from receiving health services51-53; and 28 29 Whereas, 83% of Americans believe that the \"War on Drugs\" has failed, 66% support 30 \"eliminating criminal penalties for drug possession,\" and 61% of voters support reducing 31 sentences of people currently incarcerated for drug offenses, with similar findings replicated 32 across multiple states54-58; and 33 34 Whereas, California reclassified drug possession from a felony to misdemeanor in 2014 by 35 passing ballot initiative Proposition 47, \"The Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act,\" leading 36 to the rel ease or resentencing of 3,000 people and saving the state $156 million, with a later 37 study finding no associated increase in crime59-63; and 38 39 Whereas, A 2018 study on cannabis decriminalization in five U.S. states did not find an 40 increase in the prevalence of youth cannabis use as a result of decriminalization64; and 41 42 Whereas, In 2010 the Czech Republic decriminalized personal drug possession after a 43 comprehensive policy review determined that criminal penalties did not reduce use or harm 44 and were instead costly and unjustifiable, with later studies demonstrating net societal 45 benefits without increased rates of drug use65,66; and 46 47 Whereas, Drug decriminalization in Portugal resulted in a decrease in heroin- and cocaine- 48 related seizures, HIV and drug -related deaths, and decreased societal costs related to drug 49 use67,68; and 50 Resolution: 203 (A-23) Page 4 of 9 Whereas, In 2019 the United Nations Chief Executives Board for Coordination issued a 1 statement calling for the \"promot[ion of] alternatives to conviction and punishment in 2 appropriate cases, including the decriminalization of drug possession for personal use\"18,69; 3 and 4 5 Whereas, Decriminalization of personal use and possession of drugs is supported by the 6 World Health Organization, American Public Health Association, Human Rights Watch, 7 Global Commission on Drug Policy, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent 8 Societies, NAACP, and National Latino Congreso70-76; therefore be it 9 10 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association advocate for federal and state 11 reclassification of drug possession offenses as civil infractions and the corresponding 12 reduction of sentences and penalties for individuals currently incarcerated, monitored, or 13 penalized for previous drug- related felonies (Directive to Take Action); and be it further 14 15 RESOLVED, That our AMA support federal and state efforts to expunge criminal records for 16 drug possession upon completion of a sentence or penalty at no cost to the individual (New 17 HOD Policy); and be it further 18 19 RESOLVED, That our AMA support federal and state efforts to eliminate incarceration- based 20 penalties for persons under parole, probation, pre- trial, or other criminal supervision for drug 21 possession.

RELEVANT AMA POLICY Federal Drug Policy in the United States H -95.981 The AMA, in an effort to reduce personal and public health risks of drug abuse, urges the formulation of a comprehensive national policy on drug abuse, specifically advising that the federal government and the nation should: (1) acknowledge that federal efforts to address illicit drug use via supply reduction and enforcement have been ineffective (2) expand the availability and reduce the cost of treatment programs for substance use disorders, including addiction; (3) lead a coordinated approach to adolescent drug education; (4) develop community -based prevention programs for youth at risk; (5) continue to fund the Office of National Drug Control Policy to coordinate federal drug policy; (6) extend greater protection against discrimination in the employment and provision of services to drug abusers; (7) make a long- term commitment to expanded research and data collection; (8) broaden the focus of national and local policy from drug abuse to substance abuse; and (9) recognize the complexity of the problem of substance abuse and oppose drug legalization. Citation: BOT Rep. NNN, CSAPH -13; Reaffirmed: BOT Rep. 14, I -20; Cannabis Legalization for Adult Use (commonly referred to as recreational use) H- 95.924 Our AMA: (1) believes that cannabis is a dangerous drug and as such is a serious public health concern; (2) believes that the sale of cannabis for adult use should not be legalized (with adult defined for these purposes as age 21 and older); (3) discourages cannabis use, especially by persons vulnerable to the drug's effects and in high- risk populations such as youth, pregnant women, and women who are breastfeeding; (4) believes states that have already legalized cannabis (for medical or adult use or both) should be required to take steps to regulate the product effectively in order to protect public health and safety including but not limited to: regulating retail sales, marketing, and promotion intended to encourage use; limiting the potency of cannabis extracts and concentrates; requiring packaging to convey meaningful and easily understood units of consumption, and requiring that for commercially available edibles, packaging must be child- resistant and come with messaging about the hazards about unintentional ingestion in children and youth; (5) laws and regulations related to legalized cannabis use should consistently be evaluated to determine their effectiveness; (6) encourages local, state, and federal public health agencies to improve surveillance efforts to ensure data is available on the short - and long- term health effects of cannabis, especially emergency department visits and hospitalizations, impaired driving, workplace impairment and worker -related injury and safety, and prevalence of psychiatric and addictive disorders, including cannabis use disorder; (7) supports public health based strategies, rather than incarceration, in the handling of individuals possessing cannabis for personal use; (8) encourages research on the impact of legalization and decriminalization of cannabis in an effort to promote public health and public safety; (9) encourages dissemination of information on the public health impact of legalization and decriminalization of cannabis; (10) will advocate for stronger public health messaging on the health effects of cannabis and cannabinoid inhalation and ingestion, with an emphasis on reducing initiation and frequency of cannabis use among adolescents, especially high potency products; use among women who are pregnant or contemplating pregnancy; and avoiding cannabis -impaired driving; (11) supports social equity programs to address the impacts of cannabis prohibition and enforcement Resolution: 203 (A-23) Page 8 of 9 policies that have disproportionately impacted marginalized and minoritized communities; and (12) will coordinate with other health organizations to develop resour ces on the impact of cannabis on human health and on methods for counseling and educating patients on the use cannabis and cannabinoids. Citation: CSAPH Modified: CSAPH Rep. 4, I -20; Support for Drug Courts H -100.9 55 Our AMA: (1) supports the establishment of drug courts as an effective method of intervention for individuals with addictive disease who are convicted of nonviolent crimes; (2) encourages legislators to establish drug courts at the state and local level in the United States; and (3) encourages drug courts to rely upon evidence- based models of care for those who the judge or court determine would benefit from intervention rather than incarceration. Citation: Res. 201, A -12; Appended: BOT Rep. 09, I -19; Youth Incarceration in Adult Facilities H -60.916 1. Our AMA supports, with respect to juveniles (under 18 years of age) detained or incarcerated in any criminal justice facility: (a) early intervention and rehabilitation services, (b) appropriate guidelines for parole, and (c) fairness in the expungement and sealing of records. 2. Our AMA opposes the detention and incarceration of juveniles (under 18 years of age) in adult criminal justice facilities. Citation: Alt. Res. 917, I- 16; Ending Money Bail to Dec rease Burden on Lower Income Communities H -80.993 Our AMA: (1) recognizes the adverse health effects of pretrial detention; and (2) will support legislation that promotes the use of non- financial release options for individuals charged with nonviolent crim es. Citation: Res. 408, A -18; Reaffirmed: Res. 234, A -22; The Reduction of Medical and Public Health Consequences of Drug Abuse H -95.954 Our AMA: (1) encourages national policy -makers to pursue an approach to the problem of drug abuse aimed at preventing the initiation of drug use, aiding those who wish to cease drug use, and diminishing the adverse consequences of drug use; (2) encourages policy -makers to recognize the importance of screening for alcohol and other drug use in a variety of settings, and to broaden their concept of addiction treatment to embrace a continuum of modalities and goals, including appropriate measures of harm reduction, which can be made available and accessible to enhance positive treatment outcomes for patients and society; (3) encourages the expansion of opioid maintenance programs so that opioid maintenance therapy can be available for any individual who applies and for whom the treatment is suitable. Training must be available so that an adequate number of physicians are prepared to provide treatment. Program regulations should be strengthened so that treatment is driven by patient needs, medical judgment, and drug rehabilitation concerns. Treatment goals should acknowledge the benefits of abstinence from drug use, or degrees of relative drug use reduction; (4) encourages the extensive application of needle and syringe exchange and distribution programs and the modification of restrictive laws and regulations concerning the sale and possession of needles and syringes to maximize the availability of sterile syringes and needles, while ensuring continued reimbursement for medically necessary needles and syringes. The need for such programs and modification of laws and regulations is urgent, considering the contribution of injection drug use to the epidemic of HIV infection; (5) encourages a comprehensive review of the risks and benefits of U.S. state- based drug legalization initiatives, and that until the findings of such reviews can be adequately assessed, the AMA reaffirm its opposition to drug legalization; (6) strongly supports the ability of physicians to prescribe syringes and needles to patients with injection drug addiction in conjunction with addiction counseling in order to help prevent the transmission of contagious diseas es; and (7) encourages state medical associations to work with state regulators to remove any remaining barriers to permit physicians to prescribe needles for patients. Citation: (CSA Rep. 8, A -97; Reaffirmed: CSA Rep. -99; Appended: R eaffirmation CSAPH Rep. -10; Modified: CSAPH Rep. 2, I -13) Syringe and Needle Exchange Programs H -95.958 Our AMA: (1) encourages all communities to establish needle exchange programs and physicians to refer their patients to such programs; (2) will initiate and support legislation providing funding for needle exchange programs for injecting drug users; and (3) strongly encourages state medical associations to initiate state legislation modifying drug paraphernalia laws so that injecti on drug users can purchase and Resolution: 203 (A-23) Page 9 of 9 possess needles and syringes without a prescription and needle exchange program employees are protected from prosecution for disseminating syringes. Pilot Implementation of Supervised Injection Facilities H -95.925 Our AMA supports the development and implementation of pilot supervised injection facilities (SIFs) in the United States that are designed, monitored, and evaluated to generate data to inform policymakers on the feasibility, effectiveness, and legal aspects of SIF s in reducing harms and health care costs related to injection drug use. Citation: Res. 513, A -17; AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 204 (A-23) Introduced by: Medical Student Section Subject: Supporting Harm Reduction Referred to: Reference Committee B Whereas, In 2016 it was estimated that 26.8 million people were living with opioid use disorder 1 (OUD) worldwide, almost 10% of whom (2.1 million) were living in the USA1,2; and 2 3 Whereas, Those with OUD are at increased risk of long term negative outcomes including 4 overdose; fatal overdoses involving opioids in the USA have almost quadrupled in the past 5 decade with 80,411 deaths in 2021 alone1,3; and 6 7 Whereas, Medications for OUD (MOUD), which include the opioid agonist treatments (OAT) 8 buprenorphine and methadone in addition to the opioid antagonist naltrexone, are the gold- 9 standard for treating OUD and are associated with decreased risk of negative outcomes 10 including overdose4,5; and 11 12 Whereas, In the US, over 70% of those who need treatment for OUD do not receive it and this is 13 often a result of a lack of access to adequate (or any) treatment services; only 36% of 14 substance use disorder (SUD) treatment facilities offer at least one MOUD, and just 6.1% offer 15 access to all three6,7; and 16 17 Whereas, Even if patients gain access to MOUD, not all of them will keep that access long 18 enough for therapeutic efficacy; prior to implementing a low -barrier MOUD chronic treatment 19 philosophy of \" MedFirst\" in Missouri, only 17% of uninsured patients receiving treatment for 20 OUD were prescribed buprenorphine and of these patients, 78% received the medication for 21 fewer than 5 months8; and 22 23 Whereas, The COVID -19 pandemic has exacerbated and amplified pre -existing barriers to 24 MOUD access by prompting closures of OUD treatment services, transitions to telehealth visits, 25 fears of COVID -19 exposure during methadone treatments, and changes in MOUD regulations9; 26 and 27 28 Whereas, Deaths from opioid overdose increased dramatically during the COVID- 19 pandemic; 29 for example, the state of Kentucky saw a 50% increase in emergency medical service runs for 30 deaths from suspected overdoses10,11; and 31 32 Whereas, In one study, only 76% of subjects were able to remain adherent to their 33 buprenorphine regimen during the COVID -19 pandemic with inadequate access to treatment 34 serving as a key obstacle12; and 35 36 Whereas, One consequence of inadequate treatment access is that people with OUD may 37 attempt to self -medicate with street -purchased MOUD such as buprenorphine for the purposes 38 for treatment; studies have repeatedly demonstrated that the majority of people who use non - 39 Resolution: 204 (A-23) Page 2 of 9 prescribed buprenorphine do so in a manner consistent with therapeutic treatment for 1 withdrawal sicknes s or attempts to reduce opioid use13-15; and 2 3 Whereas, Studies show that illicit buprenorphine is rarely used recreationally due to its partial 4 agonist effects and extremely low potential for overdose; US surveys have indicated that of 5 those with OUD who r eported using illicit buprenorphine, 97% used it to prevent cravings and 6 90% used it to prevent withdrawal symptoms15-23; and 7 8 Whereas, Motivators for use of unprescribed buprenorphine include: to prevent withdrawal, to 9 maintain abstinence or weaning off drugs, to avoid the overly stringent demands of formal 10 treatment, to prepare for formal treatment, to gain a sense of self -determination and agency in 11 recovery, and to use while geographically relocating; the majority of respondents to a global 12 survey indi cated they would prefer using prescribed buprenorphine if they could13,21; and 13 14 Whereas, Some physicians are hesitant to prescribe buprenorphine due to concerns over its 15 potential diversion and potential for subsequent prosecution of those involved, which may hold 16 the prescribing physician accountable24; and 17 18 Whereas, Current legislation indicates that a person in possession of buprenorphine not 19 prescribed to them is guilty of the misdemeanor crime of possession of a narcotic, which can 20 result in arrest and jail time25; and 21 22 Whereas, Criminal justice solutions to OUD are not effective and at present only 4.6% of those 23 with OUD referred to treatment by the criminal justice system are given the gold- standard opioid 24 agonist therapies, versus 40.9% of those referred to treatment from elsewhere26; and 25 26 Whereas, Although people with OUD are overrepresented in the criminal justice system, few 27 criminal justice systems use validated tools to screen those entering for OUD or provide full 28 access to MOUD to those who are incarcerated thereby impairing individuals access to 29 treatment27-31; and 30 31 Whereas, In 2018, Chittenden County in Vermont implemented several evidence- based 32 interventions including: access to buprenorphine at its syringe exchange and emergency 33 departments, elimination of the waitlist for MOUD, and decriminalization and a non -arrest policy 34 for the possession of non- prescribed buprenorphine; these resulted in a 50% decline in opioid 35 overdose deaths despite overdose deaths increasing by 20% in the remainder of the state24,25; 36 and 37 38 Whereas, In 2020, following the success of the Chittenden County intervention, the Philadelphia 39 District Attorney's Office announced that people will no longer be arrested or prosecuted for the 40 possession of non- prescribed bupreno rphine- based medications32,33; and 41 42 Whereas, Removal of buprenorphine from the misdemeanor list, as opposed to full 43 decriminalization, would eliminate consequences such as jail time and probation but may still 44 result in an infraction, which burdens the per son accused with fines, an appearance in court, 45 and possible remediation requirements34-36; and 46 47 Whereas, As opposed to misdemeanors and felonies, when charged as a civil infraction, 48 possession of substances are generally not visible under background chec ks but may still be 49 listed as public records37; and 50 Resolution: 204 (A-23) Page 3 of 9 Whereas, Our existing AMA policy (D-95.987) does not address the legal designation of 1 unprescribed buprenorphine possession thus the policy will not allow our AMA to advocate for 2 the decriminalization of buprenorphine nor for its removal from the misdemeanor list; and 3 4 Whereas, It is important to update our AMA policy to allow for the most up to date advocacy 5 (such as supporting State bill H.225 introduced in February 2021 from Vermont to decriminalize 6 therapeutic dosage of buprenorphine), especially in the midst of rising number of overdoses 7 during the COVID -19 pandemic38; and 8 9 Whereas, Another method for harm reduction is safer smoking, wherein tools to more safely 10 consume drugs via smoking, including glass stems and pipes, plastic mouthpieces for burn 11 prevention, screens, wooden push sticks, and alcohol wipes, are provided to patients39,40; and 12 13 Whereas, Providing safer smoking supplies at syringe service programs provides individuals 14 with a safer alternative to injection drug use, thus reducing risk of overdose, soft tissue 15 infections and endocarditis, and risk of infectious disease transmission (including Hepatitis C 16 and HIV) from injection drug use39-44; and 17 18 Whereas, Providing safer smoking supplies has been shown to reduce risky smoking 19 behaviors45,46; and 20 21 Whereas, Lack of access to new pipes is a reported reason why people who use drugs use 22 damaged pipes, report sharing pipes, or use self -made pipes47,48; and 23 24 Whereas, Self -made pipes increase risk for injury and chemical burns inside the mouth and 25 near the lips since materials such as plastic bottles or tin cans can give off toxic vapors and 26 cause respiratory damage49,50; and 27 28 Whereas, A 2017 study by Prangnell et al in the BMC Public Health journal evaluated rates of 29 health problems associated with crack smoking during the expansion of safer smoking kit 30 distribution in Vancouver, Canada, and found that study participants who obtained safer 31 smoking kits were significantly less likely to report health problems from smoking crack than 32 participants who made their own pipes or acquired them elsewhere51; and 33 34 Whereas, International studies elsewhere in North America and abroad demonstrate the harm 35 reduction efficacy of safer smoking kits50-54; and 36 37 Whereas, The sale, import, and export of safer smoking supplies is illegal under Title 21 U.S. 38 Code 863 - Drug paraphernalia, which prevents syringe service programs and other harm 39 reduction programs from distributing them, and prevents the allocation of public funds for their 40 distribution39,46,55; and 41 42 Whereas, AMA policy D -95.987 supports the \"continued study and implementation of 43 appropriate treatments and risk mitigation methods for patients at risk for opioid overdose\"; 44 therefore be it 45 46 RESO LVED, That our American Medical Association advocate for the removal of buprenorphine 47 from the misdemeanor crime of possession of a narcotic (Directive to Take Action); and be it 48 further 49 50 RESOLVED, That our AMA support any efforts to decriminalize the possession of non- 51 prescribed buprenorphine (New HOD Policy); and be it further 52 Resolution: 204 (A-23) Page 4 of 9 RESOLVED, That our AMA amend Policy D -95.987 by addition and deletion to read as 1 follows: 2 3 Prevention of Drug -Related Overdose, D -95.987 4 1. Our AMA: (a) recogn izes the great burden that substance 5 use disorders (SUDs) and drug-related overdoses and death 6 places on patients and society alike and reaffirms its support 7 for the compassionate treatment of patients with a SUD and 8 people who use drugs; (b) urges that community -based 9 programs offering naloxone and other opioid overdose and 10 drug safety and prevention services continue to be 11 implemented in order to further develop best practices in this 12 area; (c) encourages the education of health care workers and 13 people who use drugs about the use of naloxone and other 14 harm reduction measures in preventing opioid and other drug- 15 related overdose fatalities; and (d) will continue to monitor the 16 progress of such initiatives and respond as appropriate. 17 2.Our AMA will: (a) advocate for the appropriate education of 18 at-risk patients and their caregivers in the signs and symptoms 19 of a drug-related overdose; and (b) encourage the continued 20 study and implementation of appropriate treatments and risk 21 mitigation methods for patients at risk for a drug -related 22 overdose. 23 3. Our AMA will support the development and implementation 24 of appropriate education programs for persons receiving 25 treatment for a SUD or in recovery from a SUD and their 26 friends/families that address harm reduction measur es. 27 4. Our AMA will advocate for and encourage state and county 28 medical societies to advocate for harm reduction policies that 29 provide civil and criminal immunity for the possession, 30 distribution, and use of \"drug paraphernalia\" designed for harm 31 reduction from drug use, including but not limited to drug 32 contamination testing, safer smoking , and injection drug 33 preparation, use, and disposal supplies. 34 5. Our AMA will implement an education program for patients 35 with substance use disorder and their family/caregivers to 36 increase understanding of the increased risk of adverse 37 outcomes associated with having a substance use disorder and 38 a serious respiratory illness such as COVID -19. 39 6. Our AMA will advocate for supports efforts to increase d 40 access to and decr iminalization of fentanyl test strips , and other 41 drug checking supplies, and safer smoking kits for purposes of 42 harm reduction.

and 4 5 Whereas, Housing market demand has exceeded pre -pandemic levels of supply, and new 6 construction cannot fill the large gap in the short term due to increases in second- home buying2; 7 and 8 9 Whereas, Despite unprecedented levels of federal, state, and local support during the COVID - 10 19 pandemic, the number of individuals experiencing chronic homelessness increased by 15% 11 between 2020 and 20224; and 12 13 Whereas, In major metropolitan areas, rents have increased by more than 30% between 14 January 2021 to January 2022, placing lower income families, individuals, and veterans at an 15 increased risk for eviction and homelessness5-7; and 16 17 Whereas, The Department of Housing and Urban Development found median rent increases of 18 $100 per month were associated with a 9% increase in homelessness in the metropolitan areas 19 they examined8; and 20 21 Whereas, At -risk populations, including low -income households, minorities, veterans, and adults 22 over the age of 65 are especially vulnerable to the impacts of uncontrolled rent increases, job 23 insecurity in sectors most affected by the pandemic (i.e., leisure and hospitality; food, clothing, 24 and other goods), and medical debt3,5,9; and 25 26 Whereas, A report by the National Coalition of Asian Pacific American Community Development 27 in March 2021 revealed eviction moratoriums would affect 26% of Asian and 27% of Native 28 Hawaiians or Other Pacific Islander (NHOPI) renters and 16% of Asian and 12% of NHOPI 29 homeowners who are severely cost -burdened (i.e., greater than 50% of their income is spent on 30 housing)10; and 31 32 Whereas, Severely cost -burdened Asian Pacific Islander American communities are especially 33 at risk for eviction and subsequent homelessness as more than half (54%) of Asian households 34 have limited English proficiency compared to white households (9%)10; and 35 36 Whereas, Between 2020 and 2021, unaccompanied transgender, gender non- conforming, and 37 Native American youths (under the age of 25) experienced dramatic increases in the rates of 38 homelessness of 29%, 26%, and 21%, respectively1; and 39 Resolution: 205 (A-23) Page 2 of 6 Whereas, Youths (under the age of 25) experiencing homelessness who identify as a minority, 1 LGBTQ+, refugee, and/or immigrant are more likely to suffer from an increased number of 2 health disparities, including malnutrition, asthma, obesity, mood disorders, anxiety, physical and 3 emotional abuse, post -traumatic stress, developmental delays, high -risk sexual behaviors, drug 4 use, and rape, compared to their stably housed peers11,12; and 5 6 Whereas, Maternal and child health is significantly impacted by homelessness with increases in 7 adverse childhood experiences, depressive symptoms, and negative effects on both mental and 8 physical well- being13; and 9 10 Whereas, The costs of healthcare for individuals suffering from homelessness tend to be 11 disproportionately high when compared to others receiving healthcare with increases in 12 Veterans Affairs and Medicare utilization and cost14,15; and 13 14 Whereas, One study conducted ov er six years in California found that connecting frequent users 15 of the emergency department to housing reduced their healthcare costs overall by 59%, 16 decreased their emergency department costs by 61%, and reduced the number of inpatient 17 hospitalizations by 77%16,17; and 18 19 Whereas, Homelessness is a public health problem associated with increased mortality (where 20 one in three homeless deaths are due to preventable causes), increased prevalence of acute 21 and chronic health conditions, and increased behavioral and mental health conditions with 22 nearly 23% of homeless persons reporting having mental health conditions compared to 3% of 23 never homeless persons18,19; and 24 25 Whereas, Feasible solutions to the homelessness crisis include rent -control laws that protect 26 tenants that are unable to afford their rental payments and just cause eviction statutes that 27 protect residents from being arbitrarily evicted20,21; and 28 29 Whereas, Cities that have implemented just cause eviction statutes have lower rates of eviction 30 and filings ( -0.808% points and - 0.780% points respectively)21; and 31 32 Whereas, Right to counsel policies would ensure legal counsel representation for tenants in 33 eviction proceedings, and the creation of local, state, and/or national rental registries to monitor 34 tenant and landlord contracts and prevent unlawful evictions20; and 35 36 Whereas, There are several existing AMA policies (H -160.903, H -160.978, H -160.894, H - 37 20.903, H -345.975, H -440.938) that advocate for and support measures that improve access to 38 adequate healt h care for people experiencing homelessness through methods such as waiving 39 co-pays, or providing care through free clinics; and 40 41 Whereas, H -160.903 specifically asks that the AMA \"recognizes adaptive strategies based on 42 regional variations, community char acteristics and state and local resources are necessary to 43 address [homelessness] on a long- term basis\", and as such has set precedence for feasibly 44 supporting such measures; therefore be it 45 46 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association recognize and support the use of Street 47 Medicine programs by amending policy H -160.903 Eradicating Homelessness by addition and 48 deletion to read as follows: 49 Resolution: 205 (A-23) Page 3 of 6 Eradicating Homelessness, H -160.903 1 Our AMA: 2 (1) supports improving the health outcomes and decreasing the 3 health care costs of treating the chronically homeless through 4 clinically proven, high quality, and cost effective approaches 5 which recognize the positive impact of stable and affordable 6 housing coupled with social services; 7 (2) recognizes that stable, affordable housing as a first priority, 8 without mandated therapy or services compliance, is effective 9 in improving housing stability and quality of life among 10 individuals who are chronically -home less; 11 (3) recognizes adaptive strategies based on regional variations, 12 community characteristics and state and local resources are 13 necessary to address this societal problem on a long-term 14 basis; 15 (4) supports the use of physician-led, team -based street 16 medicine programs, which travel to individuals who are 17 unhoused or unsheltered and provide healthcare and social 18 services, as well as funds, including Medicaid and other public 19 insurance reimbursement, for their maintenance; 20 (5) recognizes the need for an effective, evidence-based 21 national plan to eradicate homelessness; 22 (6) encourages the National Health Care for the Homeless 23 Council to study the funding, implementation, and standardized 24 evaluation of Medical Respite Care for homeless persons; 25 (7) will p artner with relevant stakeholders to educate physicians 26 about the unique healthcare and social needs of homeless 27 patients and the importance of holistic, cost -effective, evidence- 28 based discharge planning, and physicians' role therein, in 29 addressing these needs; 30 (8) encourages the development of holistic, cost -effective, 31 evidence-based discharge plans for homeless patients who 32 present to the emergency department but are not admitted to 33 the hospital; 34 (9) encourages the collaborative efforts of communities, 35 physicians, hospitals, health systems, insurers, social service 36 organizations, government, and other stakeholders to develop 37 comprehensive homelessness policies and plans that address 38 the healthcare and social needs of homeless patients; 39 (10) (a) supports laws protecting the civil and human rights of 40 individuals experiencing homelessness, and (b) opposes laws 41 and policies that criminalize individuals experiencing 42 homelessness for carrying out life-sustaining activities 43 conducted in public spaces that would otherwise be considered 44 non-criminal activity (i.e., eating, sitting, or sleeping) when 45 there is no alternative private space available; and 46 (11) recognizes that stable, affordable housing is essential to 47 the health of individuals, families, and communities, and 48 supports policies that preserve and expand affordable housing 49 across all neighborhoods; 50 Resolution: 205 (A-23) Page 4 of 6 (12) (a) supports training to understand the needs of housing 1 insecure individuals for those who encounter this vulnerable 2 population through their professional duties; (b) supports the 3 establishment of multidisciplinary mobile homeless outreach 4 teams trained in issues specific to housing insecure individuals; 5 and (c) will make available existing educational resources from 6 federal agencies and other stakeholders related to the needs of 7 housing-insecure individuals .; 8 (13) encourages medical schools to implement physician-led, 9 team -based Street Medicine programs with student 10 involvement .; and 11 (14) supports federal and state efforts to enact just cause eviction 12 statutes and examine and restructure punitive eviction practices; 13 instate inflation- bas ed rent control; guarantee tenants' right to 14 counsel in housing disputes and improve affordability of legal fees; 15 and create national, state, and/or local rental registries.

(2) The AMA encourages medical schools and residency training programs to develop model curricula and to incorporate in teaching programs content on health problems of the homeless population, including experiential community -based learning experiences. (3) The AMA urges specialty societies to design interdisciplinary continuing medical education training programs that include the special treatment needs of the homeless population.

Citation: Res. 116, A -12; Reaffirmation A -15; Reaffirmed: Res. 414, A- 22; E-11.1.4 Financial Barriers to Health Care Access Health care is a fundamental human good because it affects our opportunity to pursue life goals, reduces our pain and suffering, helps prevent premature loss of life, and provides information needed to plan for our lives. As professionals, physicians individually and collectively have an ethical responsibility to ensure that all persons have access to needed care regardless of their economic means. In view of this obligation, (a) Individual physicians should: (i) take steps to promote access to care for individual patients, such as providing pro bono care in their office or through freestanding facilities or government programs that provide health care for the poor, or, when permissible, waiving insurance copayments in individual cases of hardship. Physicians in the poorest communities should be able to turn for assistance to colleagues in more prosperous communities. Resolution: 205 (A-23) Page 6 of 6 (ii) help patients obtain needed care through public or charitable programs when patients cannot do so themselves. (b) Physicians, individually and collectively through their professional organizations and institutions, should participate in the political process as advocates for patients (or support those who do) so as to diminish financial obstacles to access health car e. (c) The medical profession must work to ensure that societal decisions about the distribution of health resources safeguard the interests of all patients and promote access to health services. (d) All stakeholders in health care, including physicians, health facilities, health insurers, professional medical societies, and public policymakers must work together to ensure sufficient access to appropriate health care for all people. Issued: 2016 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 206 (A-23) Introduced by: Medical Student Section Subject: Tribal Public Health Authority Referred to: Reference Committee B Whereas, American Indian and Alaska Native Tribes and Villages (\"Tribal Nations\") and Tribal 1 Epidemiology Centers (TECs) are \"public health authorities\" under federal law at 25 U.S.C. 2 \u00a71621m and federal regulation at 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 164.5011; and 3 4 Whereas, Tribal Nations and TECs have the legal authority to collect, receive, and disseminate 5 public health data as necessary to respond to public health threats1; and 6 7 Whereas, As such, Tribal Nations and TECs have the same public health authority designation 8 as, for example, the United States (US) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and 9 state and local health departments1; and 10 11 Whereas, Despite their recognition as public health authorities, Tribal Nations and TECs have 12 varying access to data from the CDC and the Indian Health Service (IHS)2; and 13 14 Whereas, The U.S. Government Accountability Office, in a 2022 report, found a lack of policies 15 affirming Tribal Nations and TECs' authority to access CDC and IHS data, guidance for TECs 16 on how to request data, and agency procedures on how to respond to such requests2; and 17 18 Whereas, During the COVID -19 pandemic, reports emerged that county and state public health 19 agencies refused t o share case and mortality data with Tribal Nations and TECs in California 20 and the Great Plains Area, citing a lack of authority to access such data and restrictions outlined 21 by the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)3-4; and 22 23 Whereas, As public health authorities, Tribal Nations and TECs are authorized to access and 24 manage HIPAA- inclusive data, given that they are Covered Entities5-6; and 25 26 Whereas, By preventing Tribal Nations and TECs from accessing their public health data, local 27 and state governments and federal agencies like the IHS, infringe upon Tribal sovereignty and 28 do not give special attention to the health and health- related needs of American Indians and 29 Alaska Natives, potentially harming their quality of life and healthcare outcomes ( AMA Policy H- 30 350.976); therefore be it 31 32 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association advocate to achieve enactment of reforms 33 to reaffirm American Indian and Alaska Native Tribes and Tribal Epidemiology Centers' status 34 as public health authorities (Directive to Take Action); and be it further 35 36 RESOLVED, That our AMA make a suggestion to the Department of Health and Human 37 Services to develop sub- agency (e.g, CDC, IHS) guidance on Public Health and Tribal -affiliated 38 data- sharing with American Indian and Alaska Native Tribes and Villages and Tribal 39 Epidemiology Centers (New HOD Policy); and be it further 40 Resolution: 206 (A-23) Page 2 of 4 RESOLVED, That our AMA encourage the use of data- sharing agreements between local and 1 state public health departments and American Indian and Alaska Native Tribes and Villages and 2 Tribal Epidemiology Centers.

The AMA specifically recommends: (1) Indian Population: (a) In current education programs, and in the expansion of educational activities suggested below, special consideration be given to involving the American Indian and Alaska native population in training for the various health professions, in the expectation that such professionals, if provided with adequate professional resources, facilities, and income, will be more likely to serve the tribal areas permanently; (b) Exploration with American Indian leaders of the possibility of increased numbers of nonfederal American Indian health centers, under tribal sponsorship, to expand the American Indian role in its own health care; (c) Increased involvement of private practitioners and facilities in American Indian care, through such mechanisms as agreements with tribal leaders or Indian Health Service contracts, as well as normal private practice relationships; and (d) Improvement in transportation to make access to existing private care easier for the American Indian population. (2) Federal Facilities : Based on the distribution of the eligible population, transportation facilities and roads, and the availability of alternative nonfederal resources, the AMA recommends that those Indian Health Service facilities currently necessary for American Indian care be identified and that an i mmediate construction and modernization program be initiated to bring these facilities up to current standards of practice and accreditation. (3)Manpower : (a) Compensation for Indian Health Service physicians be increased to a level competitive with other Federal agencies and nongovernmental service; (b) Consideration should be given to increased compensation for service in remote areas; (c) In conjunction with improvement of Service facilities, efforts should be made to establish closer ties with teaching centers, thus increasing both the available manpower and the level of professional expertise available for consultation; (d) Allied health professional staffing of Service facilities should be maintained at a level appropriate to the special needs of the population served; (e) Continuing education opportunities should be provided for those health professionals serving these communities, and especially those in remote areas, and, increased peer contact, both to maintain the quality of care and to avert professional isolation; and (f) Consideration should be given to a federal statement of policy supporting continuation of the Public Health Service to reduce the great uncertainty now felt by many career officers of the corps. (4)Medical Societies : In those states where Indian Health Service facilities are located, and in counties containing or adjacent to Service facilities, that the appropriate medical societies should explore the possibility of increased formal liaison with local Indian Health Service physicians. Increased support from organized medicine for improvement of health care provided under their direction, including professional consultation and involvement in society activities should be pursued. (5) Our AMA also support the removal of any requirement for competitive bidding in the Indian Health Service that compromises proper care for the American Indian population. Citation: (CLRPD Rep. 3, I -98; Reaffirmed: CLRPD 08; Reaffirmation A -12; Reaffirmed: Res. 233, A -13) Improving Health Care of American Indians H -350.976 Our AMA recommends that: (1) All individuals, special interest groups, and levels of government recognize the American Indian people as full citizens of the U.S., entitled to the same equal rights and privileges as other U.S. c itizens. (2) The federal government provide sufficient funds to support needed health services for American Indians. Resolution: 206 (A-23) Page 4 of 4 (3) State and local governments give special attention to the health and health- related needs of nonreservation American Indians in an effort to improve their quality of life. (4) American Indian religions and cultural beliefs be recognized and respected by those responsible for planning and providing services in Indian health programs. (5) Our AMA recognize the \"medicine man\" as an integral and culturally necessary individual in delivering health care to American Indians. (6) Strong emphasis be given to mental health programs for American Indians in an effort to reduce the high incidence of alcoholism, homicide, suicide, and accidents. (7) A team approach drawing from traditional health providers supplemented by psychiatric social workers, health aides, visiting nurses, and health educators be utilized in solving these problems. (8) Our AMA continue its liaison with the Indian Health Service a nd the National Indian Health Board and establish a liaison with the Association of American Indian Physicians. (9) State and county medical associations establish liaisons with intertribal health councils in those states where American Indians reside. (10) Our AMA supports and encourages further development and use of innovative delivery systems and staffing configurations to meet American Indian health needs but opposes overemphasis on research for the sake of research, particularly if needed federal fun ds are diverted from direct services for American Indians. (11) Our AMA strongly supports those bills before Congressional committees that aim to improve the health of and health- related services provided to American Indians and further recommends that mem bers of appropriate AMA councils and committees provide testimony in favor of effective legislation and proposed regulations.

Our AMA adopts the following principles related to unanticipated out -of-network care: A. Patients must not be financially penalized for receiving unanticipated care from an out -of-network provider. B. Insurers must meet appropriate network adequacy standards that include adequate patient access to care, including access to hospital -based physician specialties. State regulators should enforce such standards through active regulation of health insurance company plans. C. Insurers must be transparent and proactive in informing enrollees about all deductibles, copayments and other out -of-pocket costs that enrollees may incur. D. Prior to scheduled procedures, insurers must provide enrollees with reasonable and timely access to in-network physicians. E. Patients who are seeking emergency care should be protected under the \"prudent layperson\" legal standard as established in state and federal law, without regard to prior authorization or retrospective denial for services after emergency care is rendered. F. Out -of-network payments must not be based on a contrived percentage of the Medicare rate or rates determined by the insurance company. G. Minimum coverage standards for unanticipated out -of-network services should be identified. Minimum coverage standards should pay out -of-network providers at the usual and customary out -of-network charges for services, with the definition of usual and customary based upon a percentile of all out -of- network charges for the particular health care service performed by a provider in the same or similar specialty and provided in the same geographical area as reported by a benchmarking database. Such a benchmarking database must be independently recognized and verifiable, completely transparent, independent of the control of either payers or providers and maintained by a non- profit organization. The non-profit organization shall not be affiliated with an insurer, a municipal cooperative health benefit plan or health management organization. H. Independent Dispute Resolution (IDR) should be allowed in all c ircumstances as an option or alternative to come to payment resolution between insurers and physicians. 2. Our AMA will advocate for the principles delineated in Policy H -285.904 for all health plans, including ERISA plans. 3. Our AMA will advocate that any legislation addressing surprise out of network medical bills use an independent, non- conflicted database of commercial charges.

(2) In the interest of high quality care, patients who seek medical attention on an emergency basis should have the benefit of an immediate evaluation of any indicated diagnostic studies. The physician who provides such evaluation is entitled to adequate compensation for his or her services. When such evaluations are provided as an integral part of and in conjunction with other routine services rendered by the emergency physician, ideally an inclusive charge, commensurate with the services provided, should be made. Where the carrier collapses or eliminates CPT -4 coding for payment pur poses, the physician may be left with no realistic alternative other than to itemize. Such an itemized bill should not be higher than the amount which would be paid if the appropriate inclusive charge were recognized. The interpretation of diagnostic procedures by a consulting specialist, as a separate and independent service provided the emergency patient, is equally important to good patient care. Physicians who provide such interpretations are also entitled to adequate compensation for their services. (3) Our AMA encourages state and local organizations representing the specialty of emergency medicine to work with both private and public payers in their area to implement payment practices and coding procedures which assure that payment to physicians rendering emergency care adequately reflects the extent of services provided.

and 3 4 Whereas, The IHS is underfunded relative to other federal health programs, IHS per capita 5 health care expenditures are $4,078, while figures for Veterans Healthcare Administration is 6 $10,692 and Medicaid and Medicare are $8,109 and $13,185, respectively2; and 7 8 Whereas, The IHS is considered the payor of last resort, ensuring that no payments shall be 9 made from the Indian Health Service to any provider of treatment at an IHS, Tribal, and Urban 10 Indian Health Program to the extent that such provider is eligible to receive payment for the 11 treatment from any other federal, state, local, or private source of reimbursement for which the 12 patient is eligible3; and 13 14 Whereas, IHS' sources of reimbursement include, but are not limited to, Medicare Part A and B, 15 State Medicaid, State or other federal health programs (e.g., Veterans Health Administration), 16 private insurance, and funds from Tribal health programs3; and 17 18 Whereas, Payments for IHS patients' medical care received from public programs such as 19 Medicaid and Medicare or from private insurers \u2014increased from about $943 million in fiscal 20 year 2015 to about $1.15 billion in fiscal year 2019 at its federal facilities4; and 21 22 Whereas, IHS third- party collections are increasingly important, as they represent a significant 23 portion of IHS, Tribal, and Urban Indian Health Programs' health care delivery budget and are 24 also used to procure services, supplies, and pharmaceuticals4-5; and 25 26 Whereas, An estimated 725,000 AI/AN patients served by the IHS (28.3% of population served) 27 have Medicaid coverage5; and 28 29 Whereas, As of July 2021, 41 states, including the District of Columbia, contract with Managed 30 Care Organizations (MCO) to provide for the delivery of Medicaid health benefits and additional 31 services6-7; and 32 33 Whereas, Managed Care Organizations (MCO) play a significant role in the delivery of 34 healthcare to Medicaid enrollees because states choose which populations and services to 35 include in managed care contracts (e.g. persons with disabilities, dual- eligible Medicaid and 36 Medicare beneficiaries)7; and 37 Resolution: 208 (A-23) Page 2 of 7 Whereas, There are Indian Health Care Medicaid Managed Care Provisions (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 1 438.14) protecting the rights of Indian Health Care Providers (IHCP) that must be followed by 2 state Medicaid programs or their contracted MCO8; and 3 4 Whereas, An IHCP is a health care program operated by the IHS or by an Indian Tribe, Tribal 5 Organization, or Urban Indian Organization, as those terms are defined in section 4 of the 6 Indian Health Care Improvement Act (25 U.S.C. 1603)9; and 7 8 Whereas, These provisions include: (1) allowing AI/AN Medicaid enrollees to obtain MCO - 9 covered services from out -of-network IHCPs; (2) requiring MCOs to pay out -of-network IHCPs 10 that are federally qualified health centers (FQHC) at the same rate that they would pay an in- 11 network FQHC; and (3) requiring MCOs to pay out -of-network IHCPs that are not an FQHC at 12 the IHS rate8; and 13 14 Whereas, In 2019, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Tribal Technical 15 Advisory Group (TTAG) formed a Managed Care Subcommittee to address Medicaid managed 16 care issues identified by IHCPs, AI/AN Medicaid enrollees, and Tribal leaders8; and 17 18 Whereas, Key issues identified by the CMS TTAG Subcommittee included denying AI/AN 19 enrollees the right to receive services from an IHCP of their choice, denial of claims made by 20 IHCPs to MCOs, inadequate State oversight of MCOs, and incorrect reimbursement from MCOs 21 to IHCPs for their services8; and 22 23 Whereas, Greater compliance with Indian Health Care Medicaid Managed Care Provisions (42 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.14) will improve the availability of health care services offered by IHCPs9; therefore 25 be it 26 27 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association urge stronger federal enforcement of 28 Indian Health Care Medicaid Managed Care Provisions and other relevant laws to ensure state 29 Medicaid agencies and their Medicaid managed care organizations (MCO) are complying with 30 their legal obligations to Indian health care providers (New HOD Policy); and be it further 31 32 RESOLVED, That our AMA collaborate with other stakeholders to encourage state Medicaid 33 agencies to follow the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Tribal Technical Advisory 34 Group's recommendations to improve care coordination and payment agreements between 35 Medicaid managed care organizations and Indian health care providers by, including, but not 36 limited to: 37 1.

The AMA specifically recommends: (1) Indian Population: (a) In current education programs, and in the expans ion of educational activities suggested below, special consideration be given to involving the American Indian and Alaska native population in training for the various health professions, in the expectation that such professionals, if provided with adequate professional resources, facilities, and income, will be more likely to serve the tribal areas permanently; (b) Exploration with American Indian leaders of the possibility of increased numbers of nonfederal American Indian health centers, under tribal sponsorship, to expand the American Indian role in its own health care; (c) Increased involvement of private practitioners and facilities in American Indian care, through such mechanisms as agreements with tribal leaders or Indian Health Service contracts, as well as normal private practice relationships; and (d) Improvement in transportation to make access to existing private care easier for the American Indian population. (2) Federal Facilities: Based on the distribution of the eligible population, transportation facilities and roads, and the availability of alternative nonfederal resources, the AMA recommends that those Indian Health Service facilities currently necessary for American Indian care be identified and that an immediate construction and modernization program be initiated to bring these facilities up to current standards of practice and accreditation. (3)Manpower : (a) Compensation for Indian Health Service physicians be increased to a level competitive with other Federal agencies and nongovernmental service; (b) Consideration should be given to increased compensation for service in remote areas; (c) In conjunction with improvement of Service facilities, efforts should be made to establish closer ties with teaching centers, thus increasing both the available manpower and the level of professional expertise available for consultation; (d) Allied health professional staffing of Service facilities should be maintained at a level appropriate to the special needs of the population served; (e) Continuing education opportunities should be provided for those health professionals serving these communities, and especially those in remote areas, and, increased peer contact, both to maintain the quality of care and to avert professional isolation; and (f) Consider ation should be given to a federal statement of policy supporting continuation of the Public Health Service to reduce the great uncertainty now felt by many career officers of the corps. (4)Medical Societies : In those states where Indian Health Service facilities are located, and in counties containing or adjacent to Service facilities, that the appropriate medical societies should explore the possibility of increased formal liaison with local Indian Health Service physicians. Increased support from organiz ed medicine for improvement of health care provided under their direction, including professional consultation and involvement in society activities should be pursued. (5) Our AMA also support the removal of any requirement for competitive bidding in the Indian Health Service that compromises proper care for the American Indian population. Citation: (CLRPD Rep. 3, I -98; Reaffirmed: CLRPD Reaffirmation Res. 233, A -13) Resolution: 208 (A-23) Page 4 of 7 Improving Health Care of American Indians H -350.976 Our AMA recommends that: (1) All individuals, special interest groups, and levels of government recognize the American Indian people as full citizens of the U.S., entitled to the same equal rights and privileges as other U.S. citizens. (2) The fe deral government provide sufficient funds to support needed health services for American Indians. (3) State and local governments give special attention to the health and health- related needs of nonreservation American Indians in an effort to improve their quality of life. (4) American Indian religions and cultural beliefs be recognized and respected by those responsible for planning and providing services in Indian health programs. (5) Our AMA recognize the \"medicine man\" as an integral and culturally necessary individual in delivering health care to American Indians. (6) Strong emphasis be given to mental health programs for American Indians in an effort to reduce the high incidence of alcoholism, homicide, suicide, and accidents. (7) A team approach drawi ng from traditional health providers supplemented by psychiatric social workers, health aides, visiting nurses, and health educators be utilized in solving these problems. (8) Our AMA continue its liaison with the Indian Health Service and the National Indian Health Board and establish a liaison with the Association of American Indian Physicians. (9) State and county medical associations establish liaisons with intertribal health councils in those states where American Indians reside. (10) Our AMA supports and encourages further development and use of innovative delivery systems and staffing configurations to meet American Indian health needs but opposes overemphasis on research for the sake of research, particularly if needed federal funds are diverted from direct services for American Indians. (11) Our AMA strongly supports those bills before Congressional committees that aim to improve the health of and health- related services provided to American Indians and further recommends that members of appropriate AMA councils and committees provide testimony in favor of effective legislation and proposed regulations. Citation: (CLRPD Rep. 3, I -98; Reaffirmed: Res. 221, A -07; Reaffirmation A -12; Reaffirmed: Res. 233, A - 13) Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health C are H -350.974 1. Our AMA recognizes racial and ethnic health disparities as a major public health problem in the United States and as a barrier to effective medical diagnosis and treatment. The AMA maintains a position of zero tolerance toward racially or culturally based disparities in care; encourages individuals to report physicians to local medical societies where racial or ethnic discrimination is suspected; and will continue to support physician cultural awareness initiatives and related c onsumer education activities. The elimination of racial and ethnic disparities in health care an issue of highest priority for the American Medical Association. 2. The AMA emphasizes three approaches that it believes should be given high priority: A. Great er access - the need for ensuring that black Americans without adequate health care insurance are given the means for access to necessary health care. In particular, it is urgent that Congress address the need for Medicaid reform. B. Greater awareness - racial disparities may be occurring despite the lack of any intent or purposeful efforts to treat patients differently on the basis of race. The AMA encourages physicians to examine their own practices to ensure that inappropriate considerations do not affec t their clinical judgment. In addition, the profession should help increase the awareness of its members of racial disparities in medical treatment decisions by engaging in open and broad discussions about the issue. Such discussions should take place in medical school curriculum, in medical journals, at professional conferences, and as part of professional peer review activities. C. Practice parameters - the racial disparities in access to treatment indicate that inappropriate considerations may enter the decision making process. The efforts of the specialty societies, with the coordination and assistance of our AMA, to develop practice parameters, should include criteria that would preclude or diminish racial disparities 3. Our AMA encourages the developme nt of evidence -based performance measures that adequately identify socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in quality. Furthermore, our AMA supports the use of evidence- based guidelines to promote the consistency and equity of care for all persons. Resolution: 208 (A-23) Page 5 of 7 4. Our AMA: (a) actively supports the development and implementation of training regarding implicit bias, diversity and inclusion in all medical schools and residency programs; (b) will identify and publicize effective strategies for educating residents in al l specialties about disparities in their fields related to race, ethnicity, and all populations at increased risk, with particular regard to access to care and health outcomes, as well as effective strategies for educating residents about managing the impl icit biases of patients and their caregivers; and (c) supports research to identify the most effective strategies for educating physicians on how to eliminate disparities in health outcomes in all at -risk populations.

(3) encourages states to ensure that within their Medicaid programs there is a pluralistic approach to health care financing delivery including a choice of primary care case management, partial capitation models, fee- for-service, medical savings accounts, benefit payment schedules and other approaches; (4) calls for states to create mechanisms for traditional Medicaid providers to continue to participate in Medicaid managed care and in State Children's Health Insurance Programs; (5) calls for states to streamline the enrollment process w ithin their Medicaid programs and State Children's Health Insurance Programs by, for example, allowing mail -in applications, developing shorter application forms, coordinating their Medicaid and welfare (TANF) application processes, and placing eligibility workers in locations where potential beneficiaries work, go to school, attend day care, play, pray, and receive medical care; (6) urges states to administer their Medicaid and SCHIP programs through a single state agency; (7) strongly urges states to undertake, and encourages state medical associations, county medical societies, specialty societies, and individual physicians to take part in, educational and outreach activities aimed at Medicaid- eligible and SCHIP -eligible children. Such efforts should be designed to ensure that children do not go without needed and available services for which they are eligible due to administrative barriers or lack of understanding of the programs; (8) supports requiring states to reinvest savings achieved in Medicaid programs into expanding coverage for uninsured individuals, particularly children. Mechanisms for expanding coverage may include additional funding for the SCHIP earmarked to enroll children to higher percentages of the poverty level; Medicaid expansions; prov iding premium subsidies or a buy -in option for individuals in families with income between their state's Medicaid income eligibility level and a specified percentage of the poverty level; providing some form of refundable, advanceable tax credits inversely related to income; providing vouchers for recipients to use to choose their own health plans; using Medicaid funds to purchase private health insurance coverage; or expansion of Maternal and Child Health Programs. Such expansions must be implemented to coordinate with the Medicaid and SCHIP programs in order to achieve a seamless health care delivery system, and be sufficiently funded to provide incentive for families to obtain adequate insurance coverage for their children; (9) advocates consideration of various funding options for expanding coverage including, but not limited to: increases in sales tax on tobacco products; funds made available through for -profit conversions of health plans and/or facilities; and the application of prospective payment or other cost or utilization management techniques to hospital outpatient services, nursing home services, and home health care services; (10) supports modest co- pays or income- adjusted premium shares for non- emergent, non- preventive services as a means of exp anding access to coverage for currently uninsured individuals; (11) calls for CMS to develop better measurement, monitoring, and accountability systems and indices within the Medicaid program in order to assess the effectiveness of the program, particularl y under managed care, in meeting the needs of patients. Such standards and measures should be linked to health outcomes and access to care; Resolution: 208 (A-23) Page 6 of 7 (12) supports innovative methods of increasing physician participation in the Medicaid program and thereby increasi ng access, such as plans of deferred compensation for Medicaid providers. Such plans allow individual physicians (with an individual Medicaid number) to tax defer a specified percentage of their Medicaid income; (13) supports increasing public and private investments in home and community -based care, such as adult day care, assisted living facilities, congregate living facilities, social health maintenance organizations, and respite care; (14) supports allowing states to use long- term care eligibility criteria which distinguish between persons who can be served in a home or community -based setting and those who can only be served safely and cost-effectively in a nursing facility. Such criteria should include measures of functional impairment which take into account impairments caused by cognitive and mental disorders and measures of medically related long- term care needs; (15) supports buy -ins for home and community -based care for persons with incomes and assets above Medicaid eligibility limits; and providing grants to states to develop new long- term care infrastructures and to encourage expansion of long- term care financing to middle- income families who need assistance; (16) supports efforts to assess the needs of individuals with intellectual disabilities and, as appropriate, shift them from institutional care in the direction of community living; (17) supports case management and disease management approaches to the coordination of care, in the managed care and the fee- for-service environments; (18) urges C MS to require states to use its simplified four -page combination Medicaid / Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) application form for enrollment in these programs, unless states can indicate they have a comparable or simpler form; and (19) urges CMS to ensure that Medicaid and CHIP outreach efforts are appropriately sensitive to cultural and language diversities in state or localities with large uninsured ethnic populations.

In addition, the AMA advocates that the following criteria be used in federal and/or state oversight and evaluation of managed care plans serving Medicaid beneficiaries, and insists upon their use by the Federation in monitoring the implementation of managed care for Medicaid beneficiaries: (1) Adequate and timely public disclosure of pending implementation of managed care under a state program, so as to allow meaningful public comment. (2) Phased implementation to ensure availability of an adequate, sufficiently capitalized managed care infrastructure and an orderly transition for beneficiaries and providers. (3) Geographic dispersion and accessibility of participating physicians and other providers. (4) Education of beneficiaries regarding appropriate use of services, including the emergency department. (5) Availability of off -hours, walk-in primary care. (6) Coverage for clinically effective preventive services. (7) Responsiveness to cultural, language and transportation barriers to access. (8) In programs where more than one plan is available, beneficiary freedom to choose his/her pl an, enforcement of standards for marketing/enrollment practices, and clear and comparable disclosure of plan benefits and limitations including financial incentives on providers. (9) Beneficiary freedom to choose and retain a given primary physician within the plan, and to request a change in physicians when dissatisfied. (10) Significant participating physician involvement and influence in plan medical policies, including development and conduct of quality assurance, credentialing and utilization review pr ograms. (11) Ability of plan participating physicians to determine how many beneficiaries and the type of medical problems they will care for under the program. Resolution: 208 (A-23) Page 7 of 7 (12) Adequate identification of plan beneficiaries and plan treatment restrictions to out -of-plan physicians and other providers. (13) Intensive case management for high utilizers and realistic financial disincentives for beneficiary misuse of services. (14) Treatment authorization requirements and referral protocols that promote continuity rather than fragment the process of care. (15) Preservation of private right of action for physicians and other providers and beneficiaries. (16) Ongoing evaluation and public reporting of patient outcomes, patient satisfaction and service utilization. (17) Full disclosure of plan physician and other provider selection criteria, and concerted efforts to qualify and enroll traditional community physicians and other existing providers in the plan. (18) Absence of gag rules. (19) Fairness in procedures for selection and deselection. (20) Realistic payment levels based on costs of care and predicted utilization levels. (21) Payment arrangements that do not expose practitioners to excessive financial risk for their own or referral services, and that tie any financial incentives to performance of the physician group over significant time periods rather than to individual treatment decisions. (22) Our AMA urges CMS to direct those state Medicaid agencies with Medicaid managed care programs to disseminate data and other rel evant information to the state medical associations in their respective states on a timely and regular basis.

(2) Our AMA advocates that CMS establish a procedure which state Medicaid agencies can implement to monitor managed care plans to ensure that (a) they are aware of their responsibilities under EPSDT, (b) they inform patients of entitlement to these services, and (c) they institute internal review mechanisms to ensure that children have access to medically necessary services not sp ecified in the plan's benefit package.

Our AMA will work with the American Hospital Association and other stakeholders to develop and disseminate a position paper with guidance for covering the costs of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Diabetes Prevention Recognition Program with community benefit doll ars. 3. Our AMA encourages each state medical society to work with their respective hospitals and local Diabetes Prevention Program providers to offer the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Diabetes Prevention Recognition Program to patients. 4. Our AMA encourages that private and public payors offer the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Diabetes Prevention Recognition Program to patients as part of their suite of benefits. Citation: Res. 427, A -16; Access to Specialty Care H -160.952 The AMA: (1) continues to encourage primary care and other medical specialty organizations to collaborate in developing guidelines to delineate the clinical circumstances under which treatment by primary care physicians, referral for initial or ongoing spec ialist care, and direct patient self -referral to other specialists are appropriate, timely, and cost -effective; (2) encourages the medical specialty organizations that develop referral guidelines to document the impact of the guidelines on the quality, accessibility, timeliness, and cost -effectiveness of care; and (3) urges all health plans that control access to services through a primary care case manager to cover direct access to and services by a specialist other than the case manager without financial penalty when that access is in conformance with such collaboratively developed guidelines.

(2) The federal government provide sufficient funds to support needed health services for American Indians. (3) State and local governments give special attention to the health and health- related needs of nonreservation American Indians in an effort to improve their quality of life. (4) American Indian religions and cultural beliefs be recognized and respected by those responsible for planning and providing services in Indian health programs. (5) Our AMA recognize the \"medicine man\" as an integral and culturally necessary individual in delivering health care to American Indians. (6) Strong emphasis be given to mental health programs for American Indians in an effort to reduce the high incidence of alcoholism, homicide, suicide, and accidents. (7) A team approach drawing from traditional health providers supplemented by psychiatric social workers, health aides, visiting nurses, and health educators be utilized in solving these problems. (8) Our AMA continue its liaison with the Indian Health Service and the National Indian Health Board and establish a liaison with the Association of American Indian Physicians. (9) State and county medical associations establish liaisons with intertribal health councils in those states Resolution: 209 (A-23) Page 4 of 4 where American Indians reside. (10) Our AMA supports and encourages further development and use of innovative delivery systems and staffing configurations to meet American Indian health needs but opposes overemphasis on research for the sake of research, particularly if needed federal funds are diverted from direct services for American Indians. (11) Our AMA strongly supports those bills before Congressional committees that aim to improve the health of and health- related services provided to American Indians and further recommends that members of appropriate AMA councils and committees provide testimony in favor of effective legislation and proposed regulations.

Citation: Res. 016, A -22; AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 211 (A-23) Introduced by: Medical Student Section Subject: Amending Policy H -80.999, \"Sexual Assault Survivors\", to Improve Knowledge and Access to No- cost Rape Test Kits Referred to: Reference Committee B Whereas, Rape/sexual assault affected 319,950 individuals in the United States in the year 1 2020, which is a rate of 1.2 individuals per 1,0001; and 2 3 Whereas, The estimated lifetime cost of rape is $122,461 per victim including but not limited 4 to medical forensic examination, hospitalization/emergency department bills, sexually 5 transmitted infection testing/treatment, criminal justice costs, mental health costs such as 6 depression and/or PTSD treatment, abortion costs, and emergency contraceptive costs2; and 7 8 Whereas, With more restricted access to abortion, the financial burden to rape/sexual assault 9 victims is likely to increase as patients may now need to cross state lines, obtain a hotel/find 10 temporary housing, take days off work, or incur additional costs to receive appropriate 11 medical care3-5; and 12 13 Whereas, The mental effect of rape/sexual assault may impact how victims present to the 14 hospital, as victims may be in a vulnerable state with impaired rational thought, memory 15 consolidation, and reduced energy and/or tonic immobility due to trauma6; and 16 17 Whereas, Medical forensic exams, also known as rape test kits, involve a partnership 18 between the healthcare provider and the crime lab to collect any DNA evidence on the body 19 of the victim or at the scene of the crime, physical examination to look for signs of abuse, and 20 medical history taki ng to aid in criminal case investigation7,8; and 21 22 Whereas, Rape test kits, are not financially covered by all states if the provider administering 23 the examination is not a registered Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) or Sexual 24 Assault Forensic Examiner (SAFE)9; and 25 26 Whereas, Receiving care by SANE/SAFEs is associated with better psychological well -being 27 of survivors, increased use of STI prophylaxis and emergency contraception, and higher 28 quality evidence collection resulting in better legal outcomes10; and 29 30 Whereas, Healthcare staff not trained as SANE/SAFEs have reported discomfort providing 31 sexual assault services due to lack of knowledge about evidence collection and support 32 needs, leading to increased isolation and stigmatization of victims11; and 33 34 Whereas, The speed at which medical forensic examinations must be done is between 72 35 and 96 hours after the assault has taken place, making this a time- sensitive examination12; 36 and 37 Resolution: 211 (A-23) Page 2 of 4 Whereas, While there are more than 6,000 hospitals nationally; only 800 -900 SANE 1 programs have been identified in the United States9; and 2 3 Whereas, The Department of Justice explains that states are required to work with local 4 medical providers to inform victims of the availability of no- cost forensic exams such that a 5 victim can call their local police department or hotline/crisis center to obtain information about 6 local SANEs/SAFEs9; and 7 8 Whereas, Victims who do not interact with law enforcement may not know how to access no - 9 cost medical forensic examinations; and 10 11 Whereas, Groups of individuals that have historically under -reported rape and sexual assault, 12 such as African -American and Hispanic women and the LGBTQ+ community, are less likely 13 to interact with law enforcement and therefore less likely to be informed about no-cost rape 14 test kits13-15; and 15 16 Whereas, Information about the availability of SANE/SAFEs is currently limited, and existing 17 databases are only available in certain areas, are outdated, and are often missing information16; 18 and 19 20 Whereas, Creating and ensuring accessibility to a national database of Sexual Assault Nurse 21 Examiner and Sexual Assault Forensic Examiner providers would allow all victims to quickly 22 access information on where and how to receive a time -sensitive, no -cost medical forensic 23 examinat ion; and 24 25 Whereas, Increasing accessibility to information on SANE/SAFE locations and providers 26 would allow minority and other vulnerable populations to have more equal opportunities to 27 receive no -cost medical forensic examination; therefore be it 28 29 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association amend Policy H -80.999, \"Sexual 30 Assault Survivors,\" by addition to read as follows: 31 32 Sexual Assault Survivors, H -80.999 33 1. Our AMA supports the preparation and dissemination of information 34 and best practices intended to maintain and improve the skills needed by 35 all practicing physicians involved in providing care to sexual assault 36 survivors. 37 2. Our AMA advocates for the legal protection of sexual assault survivors' 38 rights and work with state medical societies to ensure that each state 39 implements these rights, which include but are not limited to, the right to: 40 (a) receive a medical forensic examination free of charge, which includes 41 but is not limited to HIV/STD testing and treatment, pregnancy testing, 42 treatment of injuries, and collection of forensic evidence; (b) preservation 43 of a sexual assault evidence collection kit for at least the maximum 44 applicable statute of limitation; (c) notification of any intended disposal of 45 a sexual assault evidence kit with the oppor tunity to be granted further 46 preservation; (d) be informed of these rights and the policies governing 47 the sexual assault evidence kit; and (e) access to emergency 48 contraception information and treatment for pregnancy prevention. 49 Resolution: 211 (A-23) Page 3 of 4 3. Our AMA will collaborate with relevant stakeholders to develop 1 recommendations for implementing best practices in the treatment of 2 sexual assault survivors, including through engagement with the joint 3 working group established for this purpose under the Survivor's Bill of 4 Rights Act of 2016. 5 4. Our AMA will (a) advocate for increased post -pubertal patient access to 6 Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners, and other trained and qualified 7 clinicians, in the emergency department for medical forensic 8 examinations; (b) support and advocate that appropriate stakeholders, 9 such as the Health Resources and Services Administration, the United 10 States Government Accountability Office, and the Office on Violence 11 Against Women, create and implement a national database of Sexual 12 Assault Nurse Examiner and Sexual Assault Forensic Examiner 13 providers. 14 5. Our AMA will advocate at the state and federal level for (a) the timely 15 processing of all sexual examination kits upon patient consent; (b) timely 16 processing of \"backlogged\" sexual assault examination kits with patient 17 consent; and (c) additional funding to facilitate the timely testing of sexual 18 assault evidence kits.

Our AMA supports the preparation and dissemination of information and best practices intended to maintain and improve the skills needed by all practicing physicians involved in providing care to sexual assault survivors. 2. Our AMA advocates for the legal protection of sexual assault survivors' rights and work with state medical societies to ensure that each state implements these rights, which include but are not limited to, the right to: (a) receive a medical forensic examination free of charge, which includes but is not limited to HIV/STD testing and treatment, pregnancy testing, treatment of injuries, and collection of forensic evidence; (b) preservation of a sexual assault evidence collection kit for at least the maximum applicable statute of limitation; (c) notification of any intended disposal of a sexual assault evidence kit with the opportunity to be granted further preservation; (d) be informed of these rights and the policies governing the sexual assault evidence kit; and (e) access to emergency contraception information and treatment for pregnancy prevention. 3. Our AMA will collaborate with relevant stakeholders to develop recommendations for implementing best practices in the treatment of sexual assault survivors, including through engagement with the joint working group established for this purpose under the Survivor's Bill of Rights Act of 2016. 4. Our AMA will advocate for increased post -pubertal patient access to Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners, and other trained and qualified clinicians, in the emergency department for medical forensic examinations. 5. Our AMA will advocate at the state and federal level for (a) the timely processing of all sexual examination kits upon patient consent; (b) timely processing of \"backlogged\" sexual assault examination kits with patient consent; and (c) additional funding to facilitate the timely testing of sexual assault evidence kits.

(Directive to Take Action) 11 Fiscal Note: Modest - between $1,000 Cannabis and Cannabinoid Research H -95.952 1. Our AMA calls for further adequate and well -controlled studies of marijuana and related cannabinoids in patients who have serious conditions for which preclinical, anecdotal, or controlled evidence suggests possible efficacy and the application of such results to the understanding and treatment of disease. 2. Our AMA urges that marijuana's status as a federal schedule I controlled substance be reviewed with the goal of facilitating the conduct of clinical research and development of cannabinoid- based medicines, and alternate delivery methods. This should not be viewed as an endorsement of state- based medical cannabis programs, the legalization of marijuana, or that scientific evidence on the therapeutic use of cannabis meets the current standards for a prescription drug product. 3. Our AMA urges the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to develop a special schedule and implement administrative procedures to facilitate grant applications and the conduct of well -designed clinical research involving cannabis and its potential medical utility. This effort should include: a) disseminating specific information for researchers on the development of safeguards for cannabis clinical research protocols and the development of a model informed consent form for institutional review board evaluation; b) sufficient funding to support such clinical research and access for qualified investigators to adequate supplies of cannabis for clinical research purposes; c) confirming that cannabis of various and consistent strengths and/or placebo will be supplied by the National Institute on Drug Abuse to investigators registered with the DEA who are conducting bona fide clinical research studies that receive FDA approval, regardless of whether or not the NIH is the primary source of grant support. 4. Our AMA supports research to determine the consequences of long- term cannabis use, especially among youth, adolescents, pregnant women, and women who are breastfeeding. 5. Our AMA urges legislatures to delay initiating the legalization of cannabis for recreational use until further research is completed on the public health, medical, economic, and social consequences of its use. 6. Our AMA will advocate for urgent regulatory and legislative changes necessary to fund and perform research related to cannabis and cannabinoids. 7. Our AMA will create a Cannabis Task Force to evaluate and disseminate relevant scientific evidence to health care providers and the public.

This license category should adhere to the following principles: (a) exemption from such a licensure requirement for physician- to-physician consultations; (b) exemption from such a licensure r equirement for telemedicine practiced across state lines in the event of an emergent or urgent circumstance, the definition of which for the purposes of telemedicine should show substantial deference to the judgment of the attending and consulting physicians as well as to the views of the patient; (c) allowances, by exemption or other means, for out -of-state physicians providing continuity of care to a patient, where there is an established ongoing relationship and previous in- person visits, for services incident to an ongoing care plan or one that is being modified; and (d) application requirements that are non- burdensome, issued in an expeditious manner, have fees no higher than necessary to cover the reasonable costs of administering this process, and that utilize principles of reciprocity with the licensure requirements of the state in which the physician in question practices. (2) The AMA urges the FSMB and individual states to recognize that a physician practicing certain forms of telemedicine (e.g., te leradiology) must sometimes perform necessary functions in the licensing state (e.g., interaction with patients, technologists, and other physicians) and that the interstate telemedicine approach adopted must accommodate these essential quality -related functions. (3) The AMA urges national medical specialty societies to develop and implement practice parameters for telemedicine in conformance with: Policy 410.973 (which identifies practice parameters as \"educational tools\"); Policy 410.987 (which identifies practice parameters as \"strategies for patient management that are designed to assist physicians in clinical decision making,\" and states that a practice parameter developed by a particular specialty or specialties should not preclude the performance of t he procedures or treatments addressed in that practice parameter by physicians who are not formally credentialed in that specialty or specialties); and Policy 410.996 (which states that physician groups representing all appropriate specialties and practice settings should be involved in developing practice parameters, particularly those which cross lines of disciplines or specialties).

Citation: Res. 212, I -21; Reaffirmed: Res. 240, A- 22; The Site -of-Service Differential D -330.902 1. Our AMA supports Medicare payment policies for outpatient services that are site- neutral without lowering total Medicare payments. 2. Our AMA supports Medicare payments for the same service routinely and safely provided in multiple outpatient settings (eg, physician offices, HOPDs, and ASCs) that are based on sufficient and accurate data regarding the actual costs of providing the service in each setting. 3. Our AMA will urge CMS to update the data used to calculate the practice expense component of the Medicare physician fee schedule by administering a physician practice survey (similar to the Physician Practice Information Survey administered in 2007- 2008) every five years, and that this survey collect data to ensure that all physician practice costs are captured. 4. Our AMA encourages CMS to both: a) base disproportionate share hospital payments and uncompensated care payments to hospitals on actual uncompensated care data; and b) study the costs to independent physician practices of providing uncompensated care. 5. Our AMA will collect data and conduct research both: a) to document the role that physicians have played in reducing Medicare spending; and b) to facilitate adjustments to the portion of the Medicare budget allocated to physician services that more accurately reflects practice costs and changes in health care delivery. 6. Our AMA will produce a graphic report illustrating the fiscal losses and inequities that practices without facility fees have endured for decades as a result of the site of service differential factoring in inflation. 7. Our AMA will consider disseminating the resulting educational materials and graphics.

and 3 4 Whereas, The results of a 1987 survey conducted showed that as many of 2% of fertility 5 doctors polled had used their own sperm to inseminate their patients2; and 6 7 Whereas, Over the past several years, more than 50 fertility doctors in the United States 8 have been accused of fertility fraud and nearly all of the physicians who have been accused 9 were discovered as a result of DNA tests taken by their offspring3; and 10 11 Whereas, Physicians' inseminations of nonconsenting and unaware patients represent a 12 gross trespass against all standards of modern practice4; and 13 14 Whereas, Engaging in illicit insemination exploits patients' ignorance of circumstance, trust, 15 intense desire to conceive, and vulnerability and breaches other ethical obligations, including 16 the duty to disclose all relevant medical information to patients and to deal honestly with 17 them, robbing them of their decision- making autonomy4; and 18 19 Whereas, Former patients of these physicians speak of feeling violated and assaulted, their 20 personal dignity and bodily integrity trampled, their family plans routed, and their trust 21 broken5; and 22 23 Whereas, Illicit insemination is a violation of the ethical principle of respecting individual 24 autonomy to make an informed decision regarding the nature of one's health5; and 25 26 Whereas, Illicit insemination is a violation of the ethical principle and physicians' responsibility 27 to truth -telling5,6; and 28 29 Whereas, These ethical, medical, and psychological issues patients and their children face 30 as a result of physician actions directly contradicts the medical ethics principle of 31 nonmaleficence7; and 32 33 Whereas, Only four states specifically penalize physicians for inseminating their own sperm 34 into patients without express consent and there are no federal penalties2,8; and 35 36 Whereas, In Texas, Senate Bill 1259 classified illicit insemination as a form of sexual 37 assault9; and 38 Resolution: 215 (A-23) Page 2 of 4 Whereas, Indiana lawmakers introduced Senate Bill 174, making it legal for victims of fertility 1 fraud to pursue legal action against physicians who commit acts of fertility fraud10; and 2 3 Whereas, Arizona lawmakers approved Senate Bill 1237 in 2021, giving victi ms and children 4 conceived from illicit insemination the opportunity to pursue civil damages against the 5 physician committing fertility fraud11; and 6 7 Whereas, Utah House Bill 192 states that healthcare providers may not knowingly use their 8 own gametes during assisted reproductive treatment without the patient's written consent, 9 otherwise punishable as a third degree felony12; and 10 11 Whereas, A lack of laws regarding illicit insemination in the majority of states requires people 12 and families affected to seek legal action through application of existing criminal laws, such 13 as those written for criminal deception, sexual battery, or rape, which do not fully apply to or 14 encompass the actions conducted5,13; and 15 16 Whereas, The use of applicable criminal laws that were written without consideration for illicit 17 insemination may result in relevant cases being a poor fit for existing law, expiring past the 18 statutes of limitation, or lacking evidence due to temporal constraints5,13; and 19 20 Whereas, The rise of consumer genetic testing is growing in popularity with estimates of 26 21 million testing kits bought in 2019 and an annual growth rate of 12.25%14,15; and 22 23 Whereas, Hundreds of people who have been fathered by non- consensual insemination have 24 discovered this informa tion through consumer genetic testing16,17; and 25 26 Whereas, A number of countries already have legislation that restrict the number of 27 conceptions by an individual sperm donor in order to prevent unintentional consanguinity7; 28 and 29 30 Whereas, The American Soci ety of Reproductive Medicine recommends restricting 31 conceptions by individual donors to 25 births per population of 800,000 to avoid unintentional 32 consanguinity7; and 33 34 Whereas, Without measures to prevent illicit insemination by physicians, increased risk of 35 consanguinity in communities can pose a significant threat to public health and lead to 36 medical, psychological and ethical issues patients and their children must face18;

Gamete donor anonymity and limits on numbers of offspring: the views of three stakeholders. Journal of Law and the Biosciences . 2015;3(1):39- 67. doi:10.1093/jlb/lsv045 RELEVANT AMA POLICY E-4.2.1 Assisted Reproductive Technology Assisted reproduction offers hope to patients who want children but are unable to have a child without medical assistance. In many cases, patients who seek assistance have been repeatedly frustrated in their attempts to have a child and are psychologically very vulnerable. Patients whose health insurance does not cover assisted reproductive services may also be financially vulnerable. Candor and respect are thus essential for ethical practice. \"Assisted reproductive technology\" is understood as all treatments or procedures that include the handling of human oocytes or embryos. It encompasses an increasingly complex range of interventions \u2014 such as therapeutic donor insemination, ovarian stimulation, ova and sperm retrieval, in vitro fertilization, gamete intrafallopian transfer \u2014and may involve multiple participant s. Physicians should increase their awareness of infertility treatments and options for their patients. Physicians who offer assisted reproductive services should: (a) Value the well -being of the patient and potential offspring as paramount. (b) Ensu re that all advertising for services and promotional materials are accurate and not misleading. (c) Provide patients with all of the information they need to make an informed decision, including investigational techniques to be used (if any); risks, benefits, and limitations of treatment options and alternatives, for the patient and potential offspring; accurate, clinic -specific success rates; and costs. Resolution: 215 (A-23) Page 4 of 4 (d) Provide patients with psychological assessment, support and counseling or a referral to such services. (e) Base fees on the value of the service provided. Physicians may enter into agreements with patients to refund all or a portion of fees if the patient does not conceive where such agreements are legally permitted. (f) Not discriminate against patients who have difficult -to-treat conditions, whose infertility has multiple causes, or on the basis of race, socioeconomic status, or sexual orientation or gender identity. (g) Participate in the development of peer -established guidelines and se lf-regulation. Issued: 2016 E-4.2.3 Therapeutic Donor Insemination Therapeutic donor insemination using sperm from a woman's partner or a third- party donor can enable a woman or couple who might not otherwise be able to do so to fulfill the important life choice of becoming a parent (or parents). However, the procedure also raises ethical considerations about safety for the woman and potential offspring, donor privacy, and the disposition of frozen semen, as well as the use of screening to select the sex of a resulting embryo. Physicians who choose to provide artificial insemination should: (a) Provide therapeutic donor insemination in a nondiscriminatory manner. Physicians should not withhold or refuse services on the basis of nonclinical considerations, such as a patient's marital status. (b) Obtain informed consent for therapeutic donor insemination, after informing the patient (and partner, if appropriate): (i) about the risks, benefits, likelihood of success, and costs of the interv ention; (ii) about the need to screen donated semen for infectious disease agents and genetic disorders when an individual proposes to donate sperm specifically for the patient's use in therapeutic donor insemination; (iii) about the need to address in advance what will be done with frozen sperm (if any) from a known donor in the event the donor dies; (iv) that state law will govern the status, obligations, and rights of the sperm donor, known or anonymous, in relation to a resulting child. (c) When sperm is collected specifically for use by an identified patient, obtain informed consent from the prospective donor, after informing the individual: (i) about the need to test donated semen for infectious disease agents and genetic disorders; (ii) whether and how the donor will be informed in the event the semen tests positive for infectious disease or genetic disorder; (iii) that state law will govern the status, obligations, and rights of the donor in relation to a resulting child. (d) Counsel patients who choose to be inseminated with sperm from an anonymous donor to involve their partner (if any) in the decision. (e) Provide sex selection of sperm only for purposes of avoiding a sex -linked inheritable disorder. Physicians should not participate in sex selection of sperm for reasons of gender preference.

Journal of Nursing Regulation AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 219 (A-23) Introduced by: Mississippi Subject: Repealing the Ban on Physician- Owned Hospitals Referred to: Reference Committee B Whereas , The COVID -19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of physician leadership in 1 healthcare and the critical need for innovation and flexi bility during times of crisis ; and 2 3 Whereas , Physician- owned hospitals (POHs) often specialize in specific areas of medicine, 4 leading to better outcomes for patients and promoting innovation in healthcare delivery; and 5 6 Whereas , Physician ownership of hospitals can foster innovation and improve competition in the 7 healthcare market, which could help to reduce healthcare costs and improve access to care, 8 particularly in underserved areas ; and 9 10 Whereas , There are concerns that physician- owned hospitals may be more likely to engage in 11 self-referral or overutilization of services, which could lead to higher costs and lower quality of 12 care; and 13 14 Whereas , Safeguards and regulations can be put in place to ensure that physician- owned 15 hospitals are operating in the best interests of patients ; and 16 17 Whereas , Physician leadership is critical in healthcare, particularly during times of crisis, such 18 as the COVID -19 pandemic ; and 19 20 Whereas , Restrictions on physician ownership of hospitals may limit access to quality care for 21 patients in underserved areas ; and 22 23 Whereas , The American Medical Association has a longstanding policy of supporting the role of 24 physicians in healthcare leadership and advocating for policies that promote physician 25 ownership of healt hcare facilities ; and 26 27 Whereas , It is critical to ensure that physicians are able to provide the highest quality care and 28 make decisions based solely on the best interests of their patients; and 29 30 Whereas , Allowing physicians to have ownership in hospitals can provide incentives for quality 31 improvement, cost control, and greater coordination of care, leading to better patient outcomes 32 and satisfaction ; and 33 34 Whereas , The Affordable Care Act and other healthcare policy reforms have emphasized the 35 importance of value- based care and alternative payment models, which align with the goals of 36 POHs and their emphasis on quality, efficiency, and cost -effectiveness ; and 37 Resolution: 219 (A-23) Page 2 of 3 Whereas , Physician ownership of hospitals is common in many other countries, including 1 Canada, Germany, and the United Kingdom, and has not been associated with negative 2 consequences for patient care or healthcare costs ; and 3 4 Whereas , POHs have played a critical role in providing essential services during natural 5 disasters and pandemics, as demonstrated by their response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 6 2005 and the COVID -19 pandemic in 2020 ; and 7 8 Whereas , POHs provide valuable opportunities for physician training and education, research, 9 and innovation; and 10 11 Whereas , Physicians have a unique perspective and expertise that can be valuable in hospital 12 governance and decision -making, and can help to ensure that the patient's best interests are 13 always at the forefront of hospital operations ; therefore be it 14 15 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association advocate for policies that alleviate any 16 restriction upon physicians from owning, constructing, and/or expanding any hospital facility 17 type - in the name of patient safety, fiscal responsibility, transparency, and in acknowledgment 18 of physici ans dedication to patient care (Directive to Take Action);

[Emphasis added.]\" (Medicare Managed Care Manual, Chapter 20 4, Section 10.7.1); and 21 22 Whereas, Current Medicare policy only holds that the Medicare Advantage Organization (MAO) 23 is responsible for paying the enrollee the cost- sharing portion that was incurred with the original 24 Medicare coverage for qualified clinical trial items (paragraph 3 of Section 10.7.1); and 25 26 Whereas, For the enrollee to receive reimbursement from the MAO for this cost -sharing portion, 27 current Medicare policy states, \"To be eligible for reimbursement, an enrollee must notify their 28 plan that the enrollee received a qualified clinical trial service and provide documentation of the 29 cost- sharing incurred, as a provider bill\" (paragraph 4 of section 10.7.1); and 30 31 Whereas, This means that a Medicare Advantage enrollee who enters a qualified clinical trial is 32 obligated to pay the cost -sharing portion of their standard -of-care services, and then to seek 33 reimbursement from the MAO, even though the enrollee would otherwise never have been billed 34 by the MAO for such standard services, including the cost -sharing portion; and 35 36 Resolution: 220 (A-23) Page 2 of 3 Whereas, The cost -sharing portion of standard services for patients enrolling on clinical trials 1 (trials that address critical questions in oncology, heart disease, and a host of other serious 2 conditions) can amount to tens of thousands of dollars across months of treatment for a single 3 patient; and 4 5 Whereas, These policies annually affect many thousands of patients enrolling on large -scale 6 clinical trials (including many funded by NIH and its individual Institutes); and 7 8 Whereas, These policies punish public -spirite d patients who enter clinical trials that will provide 9 future generations with better medical treatments and improved health outcomes, even though 10 that individual has no rational expectation of benefit, given the clinical equipoise inherent in a 11 clinical t rial; and 12 13 Whereas, These policies create a profound financial disincentive for patients to enter clinical 14 trials, who thereby incur many thousands of dollars in liabilities in exchange only for the promise 15 of potential future reimbursement, making trial enrollment very unattractive; and 16 17 Whereas, Most Medicare Advantage patients will not enroll in clinical trials if they are informed 18 of these financial liabilities; and 19 20 Whereas, Such policies effectively provide the MAO these sums free- of-charge for many 21 months, even though the MAO ultimately will be liable to pay these sums - in short, a \"loan\" 22 from the enrollee to the MAO; and 23 24 Whereas, A recent inquiry across member organizations of the Association of American Cancer 25 Institutes (AACI) identified numerous institutions across the country that reported increasing 26 difficulties with billing and reimbursement for their MAO patients; and 27 28 Whereas, At least one of these institutions (namely, Dartmouth Cancer Center) has incurred 29 significant costs to employ additional financial services staff to advise and support patients who 30 are wrestling with these payment difficulties, a fact that vividly demonstrates the needs of these 31 vulnerable, public -spirited patients and the demands on institutions attempting to support them; 32 and 33 34 Whereas, Such individual institutional interventions can only serve as temporary stopgaps and 35 cannot serve as long -term solutions to this issue, inasmuch as they create unsustainable costs 36 at the single institutional level and would engender massive expenditures if implemented across 37 larger systems and disease types; therefore be it 38 39 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association advocate that the Centers for Medicare 40 and Medicaid Services require that Medicare Advantage Organizations (MAOs ) pay for routine 41 costs for services that are provided as part of clinical trials covered under the Clinical Trials 42 National Coverage Determination 310.1, just as the MAO would have been required to do so 43 had the patient not enrolled in the qualified clini cal trial.

(2) Our AMA continues to advocate vigorously for a stable, continuing base of funding and support for all aspects of clinical research within the research programs of all relevant federal agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, the Agency for Healthcare Resear ch and Quality, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense. (3) The AMA believes it is an inherent obligation of capitation programs and managed care organizations to invest in broad- based clinical research (as well as in health care delivery and outcomes research) to assure continued transition of new developments from the research bench to medical practice. The AMA strongly encourages these groups to make significant financial contributio ns to support such research. (4) Our AMA continues to encourage medical schools a) to support clinical research; b) to train and develop clinical researchers; c) to recognize the contribution of clinical researchers to academic medicine; d) to assure the highest quality of clinical research; and e) to explore innovative ways in which clinical researchers in academic health centers can actively involve practicing physicians in clinical research. (5) Our AMA encourages and supports development of community and practice- based clinical research networks.

Our AMA supports that Medicare Advantage plans must provide enrollees with coverage for, at a minimum, all Part A and Part B original Medicare services, if the enrollee is entit led to benefits under both parts. 2. Our AMA will advocate: (a) for better enforcement of Medicare Advantage regulations to hold the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) accountable for presenting transparency of minimum standards and to determin e if those standards are being met for physicians and their patients; (b) that Medicare Advantage plans be required to post all components of Medicare covered and not covered in all plans across the US on their website along with the additional benefits pr ovided; and (c) that CMS maintain a publicly available database of physicians in network under Medicare Advantage and the status of each of these physicians in regard to accepting new patients in a manner least burdensome to physicians.

Our AMA: (a) recognizes the great burden that substance use disorders (SUDs) and 4 drug- related overdoses and death places on patients and society alike and reaffirms its 5 support for the compassionate treatment of patients with a SUD and people who use 6 drugs; (b) urges that community -based programs offering naloxone and other opioid 7 overdose and drug safety and prevention services continue to be implemented in order 8 to further develop best practices in this area; (c) encourages the education of health care 9 workers and people who use drugs about the use of naloxone and other harm reduction 10 measures in preventing opioid and other drug- related overdose fatalities; and (d) will 11 continue to monitor the progress of such initiatives and respond as appropriate. 12 2. Our AMA will: advocate for the removal of FTS from the legal definition of drug 13 paraphernalia. 14 3. Our AMA will: (a) advocate for the appropriate education of at -risk patients and their 15 caregivers in the signs and symptoms of a drug- related overdose; and (b) encourage the 16 continued study and implementation of appropriate treatments and risk mitigation 17 methods for patients at risk for a drug -related overdose. 18 4. Our AMA will support the development and implementation of appropriate education 19 programs for persons receiving treatment for a SUD or in recovery from a SUD and their 20 friends/families th at address harm reduction measures. 21 5. Our AMA will advocate for and encourage state and county medical societies to 22 advocate for harm reduction policies that provide civil and criminal immunity for the 23 possession, distribution, and use of \"drug paraphernalia\" designed for harm reduction 24 from drug use, including but not limited to drug contamination testing and injection drug 25 preparation, use, and disposal supplies. 26 6. Our AMA will implement an education program for patients with substance use disorder 27 and their family/caregivers to increase understanding of the increased risk of adverse 28 outcomes associated with having a substance use disorder and a serious respiratory 29 illness such as COVID -19. 30 7. Our AMA supports efforts to increase access to fentanyl test strips and other drug 31 checking supplies for purposes of harm reduction by supporting both legalization of FTS 32 use by patients, as well as training in FTS use, by pertinent professionals.

and 4 5 Whereas, Gender incongruence refers to when the gender identity of a person does not align 6 with the gender assigned at birth, and gender dysphoria is a condition in which a person with 7 gender incongruence experiences significant burden associated with DSM classification; people 8 experiencing gender incongruence and/or gender dysphoria may or may not identify as 9 transgender or non -binary2; and 10 11 Whereas, World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) establishes 12 standards of care for children and adolescents that allow for puberty suppressing hormones (a 13 fully reversible intervention) at onset of puberty, hormone replacement therapy for adolescents 14 who have begun the physical changes of puberty, and limited gender -affirming surgical 15 treatments in some cases3; and 16 17 Whereas, The Endocrine Society recommends that gender -affirming hormone therapy, which is 18 partially reversible, be offered to adolescents who continue to demonstrate gender 19 incongruence with pubertal hormone suppression, and who demonstrate the ability to provide 20 informed consent, usually beginning at 16 years old4; and 21 22 Whereas, The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) states that gender -affirming medical care 23 for gender -diverse and transgender adolescents may include puberty blockers during puberty 24 and/or cross -sex hormone therapy from early adolescence onward5; and 25 26 Whereas, Data from the AAP showed that 50% of transgender male teens, 30% of transgender 27 female teens, and 42% of nonbinary youth reported attempting suicide in their lifetime6; and 28 29 Whereas, Studies of transgender and non- binary youth and adults show that those r eceiving 30 gender -affirming hormone therapy or puberty blockers have decreased anxiety and depression 31 symptoms, reduced suicidality, and increased appearance congruence, positive affect, and life 32 satisfaction7-10; and 33 34 Whereas, The ACLU is currently tracking several hundred anti -LGBTQ bills in the United States, 35 many of which are targeted towards transgender youth and directly outline, ban, and/or 36 criminalize gender -affirming medical and surgical procedures, name them as child abuse, 37 prohibit physicians from providing said procedures by subjecting them to felony charges and/or 38 Resolution: 223 (A-23) Page 2 of 7 other legal repercussions, and/or deny public funding or insurance coverage for their 1 provision11,12; and 2 3 Whereas, As of April 2023, laws that prohibit or restrict access to gender -affirming care for 4 transgender youth have already passed at the state- level in twelve states, and Florida has 5 banned gender -affirming care for minors via votes of the Florida Board of Medicine and Florida 6 Board of Osteopathic Medicine12-14; and 7 8 Whereas, Some proposed bills extend restrictions on gender -affirming care to include 9 transgender young adults up to 21 -26 years old in addition to transgender minors and/or 10 effectively ban gender affirming care for all adults by restricting reimbursement f or providers or 11 prohibiting coverage with public funds15-17; and 12 13 Whereas, The Human Rights Campaign reports that over half of transgender youth, ages 13 to 14 17, have lost or are at risk of losing access to medically necessary gender -affirming care in their 15 state18; and 16 17 Whereas, Surveys of transgender and gender -diverse youth and parents of these youth show 18 that debates about the rights of transgender people and proposed legislation restricting access 19 to gender -affirming care have negatively impacted mental health and led to increased 20 discrimination for youth19,20; and 21 22 Whereas, Several states, including Minnesota, Illinois, New Mexico, Vermont, and New Jersey, 23 have enacted bills or policies that protect physicians and patients providing and receiving 24 gender -affirming care and/or declared themselves as \"safe haven\" states, and several other 25 states have similar bills being introduced21,22; and 26 27 Whereas, In 2022, Boston Children's Hospital and Akron Children's Hospital received threats of 28 violence due to the fa ct that these hospitals provide gender -affirming care for youth, and the 29 AMA and AAP spoke out against these instances23-25; and 30 31 Whereas, Several other medical organizations, including the American Academy of Child and 32 Adolescent Psychiatry, American Coll ege of Physicians, American Psychiatric Association, 33 American Psychological Association, Endocrine Society, and Pediatric Endocrine Society, have 34 spoken against these bills restricting gender -affirming care for transgender youth26-31; and 35 36 Whereas, Over the last few years, the AMA has written several correspondences to state 37 governments and the National Governors Association to oppose legislative efforts to restrict and 38 criminalize gender -affirming care for minors32-38; and 39 40 Whereas, The American Medical As sociation supports \"treatment models for gender diverse 41 people that promotes informed consent, personal autonomy, increased access for gender 42 affirming treatments and eliminates unnecessary third party involvement outside of the 43 physician- patient relations hip in the decision making process\" (AMA Policy H -140.824); 44 therefore be it 45 46 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association work with state and specialty societies and 47 other interested organizations to oppose any and all criminal and other legal penalties against 48 patients seeking gender -affirming care and against parents and guardians who support minors 49 seeking and receiving gender -affirming care; including the penalties of loss of custody and the 50 inappropriate characterization of gender -affirming care as child abuse (Directive to Take Action ); 51 and be it further 52 Resolution: 223 (A-23) Page 3 of 7 RESOLVED, That our AMA advocate for protections from violence, criminal or other legal 1 penalties, adverse medical licensing actions, and liability , including responsibility for future 2 medical costs , for (a) healthcare facilities that provide gender -affirming care; (b) physicians and 3 other healthcare providers who provide gender -affirming care; and (c) patients seeking and 4 receiving gender -affirming care (Directive to Take Action); and be it fur ther 5 6 RESOLVED, That our AMA work with state and specialty societies and other interested 7 organizations to advocate against state and federal legislation that would prohibit or limit 8 gender -affirming care (Directive to Take Action); and be it further 9 10 RESOLVED, That our AMA work with other interested organizations to communicate with the 11 Federation of State Medical Boards about the importance of preserving gender -affirming care 12 despite government intrusions (Directive to Take Action); and be it further 13 14 RESOLVED, That our AMA amend policy H -185.927, \"Clarification of Medical Necessity for 15 Treatment of Gender Dysphoria,\" by insertion and deletion as follows : 16 17 Clarification of Medical Necessity for Treatment of Gender Dysphoria, H -185.927 18 Our AMA: (1) recognizes that medical and surgical treatments for gender dysphoria and 19 gender incongruence, as determined by shared decision making between the patient 20 and physician, are medically necessary as outlined by generally -accepted standards of 21 medic al and surgical practice; (2) will advocate for federal, state, and local policies to 22 provide medically necessary care for gender dysphoria and gender incongruence; and 23 (3) opposes the criminalization and otherwise undue restriction of evidence - 24 based gender -affirming care will support legislation, ballot initiatives and state and 25 federal policies to protect access to gender affirming care.

Resolution: 223 (A-23) Page 5 of 7 RELEVANT AMA POLICY Removing Financial Barriers to Care for Transgender Patients H -185.950 Our AMA supports public and private health insurance coverage for treatment of gender dysphoria as recommended by the patient's physician. Citation: -08; -16; Reaffirmed: Res. 012, A -22; Clarification of Medical Necessity for Treatment of Gender Dysphoria H -185.927 Our AMA: (1) recognizes that medical and surgical treatments for gender dysphoria, as determined by shared decision making between the patient and physician, are medically necessary as outlined by generally -accepted standards of medical and surgical practi ce; (2) will advocate for federal, state, and local policies to provide medically necessary care for gender dysphoria; and (3) opposes the criminalization and otherwise undue restriction of evidence- based gender -affirming care. Citation: Res. 05, A -16; Mod ified: Res. 015, A -21; Healthcare Equity Through Informed Consent and a Collaborative Healthcare Model for the Gender Diverse Population H -140.824 Our AMA supports: (1) shared decision making between gender diverse individuals, their health care team, and, where applicable, their families and caregivers; and (2) treatment models for gender diverse people that promotes informed consent, personal autonomy, increased access for gender affirming treatments and eliminates unnecessary third party involvement out side of the physician- patient relationship in the decision making process. Citation: Res. 014, A -22; Affirming the Medical Spectrum of Gender H -65.962 Our AMA opposes any efforts to deny an individual's right to determine their stated sex marker or gender identity. Citation: Res. 005, I -18; Health Care Needs of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Populations H -160.991 1. Our AMA: (a) believes that the physician's nonjudgmental recognition of patients' sexual orientations, sexual behaviors, and g ender identities enhances the ability to render optimal patient care in health as well as in illness. In the case of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, and other (LGBTQ) patients, this recognition is especially important to address the specific health care needs of people who are or may be LGBTQ; (b) is committed to taking a leadership role in: (i) educating physicians on the current state of research in and knowledge of LGBTQ Health and the need to elicit relevant gender and sexuality information from our patients; these efforts should start in medical school, but must also be a part of continuing medical education; (ii) educating physicians to recognize the physical and psychological needs of LGBTQ patients; (iii) encouraging the devel opment of educational programs in LGBTQ Health; (iv) encouraging physicians to seek out local or national experts in the health care needs of LGBTQ people so that all physicians will achieve a better understanding of the medical needs of these populations; and (v) working with LGBTQ communities to offer physicians the opportunity to better understand the medical needs of LGBTQ patients; and (c) opposes, the use of \"reparative\" or \"conversion\" therapy for sexual orientation or gender identity. 2. Our AMA wil l collaborate with our partner organizations to educate physicians regarding: (i) the need for sexual and gender minority individuals to undergo regular cancer and sexually transmitted infection screenings based on anatomy due to their comparable or elevat ed risk for these conditions; and (ii) the need for comprehensive screening for sexually transmitted diseases in men who have sex with men; (iii) appropriate safe sex techniques to avoid the risk for sexually transmitted diseases; and (iv) that individuals who identify as a sexual and/or gender minority (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning individuals) experience intimate partner violence, and how sexual and gender minorities present with intimate partner violence differs from their cisge nder, heterosexual peers and may have unique complicating factors. 3. Our AMA will continue to work alongside our partner organizations, including GLMA, to increase physician competency on LGBTQ health issues. Resolution: 223 (A-23) Page 6 of 7 4. Our AMA will continue to explore opportunit ies to collaborate with other organizations, focusing on issues of mutual concern in order to provide the most comprehensive and up- to-date education and information to enable the provision of high quality and culturally competent care to LGBTQ people.

Citation: Res. 621, A -22; AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 224 (A-23) Introduced by: American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons Subject: Advocacy Against Obesity -Related Bias by Insurance Providers Referred to: Reference Committee B Whereas , Our American Medical Association has recognized obesity as a disease; and 1 2 Whereas, Obesity is the most common chronic disease in adulthood; and 3 4 Whereas, Untreated obesity leads to significant morbidity, premature mortality, and an enormous 5 financial burden to society from health care costs and lost productivity; and 6 7 Whereas, Our AMA is committed to promoting the highest standards of medical care and 8 improving public health ; and 9 10 Whereas, Effective treatment of the disease obesity requires a comprehensive multi- disciplinary 11 approach delivered lifelong, including lifestyle therapy, anti-obesity medications, and metabolic 12 and bariatric surgery, either sequentially or in an adjuvant fashion; and 13 14 Whereas, Our AMA recognizes the importance of bariatric surgery as an effective treatment for 15 obesity and related comorbidities; and 16 17 Whereas, Metabolic Bariatric Surgery in the United States is associated with consistently low 18 mortality and morbidity rates, and 19 20 Whereas, The practice of Metabolic Bariatric Surgery in the United States is overwhelmingly 21 subjected to accreditation and oversight by the American College of Surgeons and the Society 22 for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgeons; and 23 24 Whereas, Studies have shown that access to bariatric surgery reduces healthcare costs and 25 improves patient outcomes; and 26 27 Whereas, Studies have shown that Metabolic Bariatric Surgery results in a reduction on the 28 incidence of several cancers and improves survivorship in patients with cancer; and 29 30 Whereas, In 2022, the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery established 31 baseline criteria for the indications for the practice of metabolic surgery based on the available 32 scientific evidence; and 33 34 Whereas, Despite ample evidence to the contrary, m any public and private insurance providers 35 currently impose arbitrary restrictions and discriminatory practices that limit or deny coverage for 36 metabolic surgery , such as mandatory preoperative weight management programs and time- 37 based delays. Such tactics discourage patients from completing preoperative programs and 38 lead to continued comorbidity related to the disease of obesity ; and 39 Resolution: 224 (A-23) Page 2 of 3 Whereas, Recent AMA policy D-440.954, \"Addressing Adult and Pediatric Obesity ,\" establishes 1 the AMA as working to improve national understanding of the obesity epidemic and address gaps 2 in medical obesity education and health disparities, and the lack of insurance coverage for 3 obesity treatment; therefore be it 4 5 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association urge individual state delegations to directly 6 advocate for their state insurance agenc ies and insurance providers in their jurisdiction to 7 8 1. Revise their policies to ensure that bariatric surgery is covered for patients 9 who meet the appropriat e medical criteria. 10 2. Eliminate criteria that place unnecessary time -based mandates that are not 11 clinically supported nor directed by the patient's medical provider 12 3. Ensure that insurance policies in their states do not discriminate against 13 potential metabolic surgery patients based on age, gender, race, ethnicity, 14 socioeconomic status . 15 4. Advocate for the cost -effectiveness of all obesity treatment modalities in 16 reducing healthcare costs and improving patient outcom es (Directive to Take 17 Action); and be it further 18 19 RESOLVED, That the AMA support and provide resources to state delegations in their efforts to 20 advocate for the reduction of bias against patients that suffer from obesity for the actions listed. 21 (Directive to Take Action) 22 Fiscal Note: Modest - between $1,000 - $5,000 Received: 5/2/23 RELEVANT AMA POLICY Addressing Adult and Pediatric Obesity D -440.954 1. Our AMA will: (a) assume a leadership role in collaborating with other interested organizations, including national medical specialty societies, the American Public Health Association, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, and the AMA Alliance, to discuss ways to finance a comprehensive national program for the study , prevention, and treatment of obesity, as well as public health and medical programs that serve vulnerable populations; (b) encourage state medical societies to collaborate with interested state and local organizations to discuss ways to finance a comprehensive program for the study, prevention, and treatment of obesity, as well as public health and medical programs that serve vulnerable populations; and (c) continue to monitor and support state and national policies and regulations that encourage healthy lifestyles and promote obesity prevention. 2. Our AMA, consistent with H -440.842, Recognition of Obesity as a Disease, will work with national specialty and state medical societies to advocate for patient access to and physician payment for the full contin uum of evidence- based obesity treatment modalities (such as behavioral, pharmaceutical, psychosocial, nutritional, and surgical interventions). 3. Our AMA will work with interested national medical specialty societies and state medical associations to incr ease public insurance coverage of and payment for the full spectrum of evidence- based adult and pediatric obesity treatment. 4. Our AMA will: (a) work with state and specialty societies to identify states in which physicians are restricted from providing t he current standard of care with regards to obesity treatment; and (b) work with interested state medical societies and other stakeholders to remove out -of-date restrictions at the state and federal level prohibiting healthcare providers from providing the current standard of care to patients affected by obesity. 5. Our AMA will leverage existing channels within AMA that could advance the following priorities: \u00b7 Promotion of awareness amongst practicing physicians and trainees that obesity is a treatable chronic disease along with evidence- based treatment options. Resolution: 224 (A-23) Page 3 of 3 \u00b7 Advocacy efforts at the state and federal level to impact the disease obesity. \u00b7 Health disparities, stigma and bias affecting people with obesity. \u00b7 Lack of insurance coverage for evidence- based treatments including intensive lifestyle intervention, anti - obesity pharmacotherapy and bariatric and metabolic surgery. \u00b7 Increasing obesity rates in children, adolescents and adults. \u00b7 Drivers of obesity including lack of healthful food choices, over -exposure to obesogenic foods and food marketing practices. 6. Our AMA will conduct a landscape assessment that includes national level obesity prevention and treatment initiatives, and medical education at all levels of training to identify gaps and opportun ities where AMA could demonstrate increased impact. 7. Our AMA will convene an expert advisory panel once, and again if needed, to counsel AMA on how best to leverage its voice, influence and current resources to address the priorities listed in item 5. above.

All rights r eserved . REPORT OF THE COUNCIL ON MEDICAL EDUCATION CME Report 01- A-23 Subject: Council on Medical Education Sunset Review of 2013 House of Delegates ' Policies Presented by: John P. Williams, MD, Chair Referred to: Reference Committee C Policy G -600.110, \"Sunset Mechanism for AMA Policy, \" calls for the decennial review of 1 American Medical Association (AMA) policies to ensure that our AMA 's policy database is 2 current, coherent, and relevant : 3 4 1. As the House of Delegates ad opts policies, a maximum ten -year time horizon shall exist. A 5 policy will typically sunset after ten years unless action is taken by the House of Delegates to 6 retain it. Any action of our AMA House that reaffirms or amends an existing policy position 7 shall reset the sunset \" clock, \" making the reaffirmed or amended policy viable for another 10 8 years. 9 10 2. In the implementation and ongoing operation of our AMA policy sunset mechanism, the 11 following procedures shall be followed: (a) Each year, the Speakers shall provide a list of 12 policies that are subject to review under the policy sunset mechanism; (b) Such policies shall be 13 assigned to the appropriate AMA councils for review; (c) Each AMA council that has been 14 asked to review policies shall develo p and submit a report to the House of Delegates identifying 15 policies that are scheduled to sunset; (d) For each policy under review, the reviewing council 16 can recommend one of the following actions: (i) retain the policy; (ii) sunset the policy; (iii) 17 retain part of the policy; or (iv) reconcile the policy with more recent and like policy; (e) For 18 each recommendation that it makes to retain a policy in any fashion, the reviewing council shall 19 provide a succinct, but cogent justification ; (f) The Speakers sh all determine the best way for 20 the House of Delegates to handle the sunset reports. 21 22 3. Nothing in this policy shall prohibit a report to the HOD or resolution to sunset a policy earlier 23 than its 10- year horizon if it is no longer relevant, has been supers eded by a more current policy, 24 or has been accomplished. 25 26 4. The AMA councils and the House of Delegates should conform to the following guidelines for 27 sunset: (a) when a policy is no longer relevant or necessary; (b) when a policy or directive has 28 been ac complished; or (c) when the policy or directive is part of an established AMA practice 29 that is transparent to the House and codified elsewhere such as the AMA Bylaws or the AMA 30 House of Delegates Reference Manual: Procedures, Policies and Practices. 31 32 5. The most recent policy shall be deemed to supersede contradictory past AMA policies. 33 34 6. Sunset policies will be retained in the AMA historical archives. 35 CME Rep. 01- A-23 -- page 2 of 20 RECOMMENDATION 1 2 The Council on Medical Education recommends that the House of Delegates policies listed in the 3 appendix to this report be acted upon in the manner indicated and the remainder of this report be 4 filed. (Directive to Take Action) 5 Fiscal Note: $1,000. CME Rep. 01-A-23 -- page 3 of 20 APPENDIX: RECOMMENDED ACTIONS Policy Number Title Text Recommendation D-295.960 Clinical Skills Training in Medical Schools Our AMA: (1) encourages medical schools to reevaluate their educational programs to ensure appropriate emphasis of clinical skills training in medical schools; (2) encourages medical schools to include longitudinal clinical experiences for students during the \"preclinical \" years of medical educa tion; (3) will evaluate the cost/value equation, benefits, and consequences of the implementation of standardized clinical exams as a step for licensure, along with the barriers to more meaningful examination feedback for both examinees and US medical schools, and provide recommendations based on these findings; and (4) will evaluate the consequences of the January 2013 changes to the USMLE Step II Clinical Skills exam and their implications for US medical students and international medical graduates. (Res. 324, A -03; Appended: Res. 309, A -11; Appended: Res. 904, I -13) Retain clause 2, which is still relevant and not superseded by other AMA policy , and sunset clauses 1, 3, and 4, to read as follows : \"Our AMA: (1) encourages medical schools to reevaluate their educational programs to ensure appropriate emphasis of clinical skills training in medical schools; (2) encourages medical schools to include longitudinal clinical experiences for students during the \"preclinical \" years of medical education ; (3) will evaluate the cost/value equation, benefits, and consequences of the implementation of standardized clinical exams as a step for licensure, along with the barriers to more meaningful examination feedback for b oth examinees and US medical schools, and provide recommendations based on these findings; and (4) will evaluate the consequences of the January 2013 changes to the USMLE Step II Clinical Skills exam and their implications for US medical students and inter national medical graduates .\" The contents of c lause 1 are required of medical school programs with accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) and is reviewed periodically , and are reflected in H-295.995 (12) (17a) (17b) , \"Recommendations for Future Directions for Medical Education ,\" which read: \"(12) The curriculum of a medical school should be designed to provide students with experience in clinical medicine ranging from primary to tertiary care in a variety of inpatient and outpatient settings, such as university hospitals, community hospitals, and other health care facilities. Med ical schools should establish standards and apply them to all components of the clinical educational program regardless of where they are conducted. Regular evaluation of the quality of each experience and its CME Rep. 01-A-23 -- page 4 of 20 contribution to the total program should be co nducted. \" \"(17a) Faculties of medical schools should reevaluate the current elements of their fourth or final year with the intent of increasing the breadth of clinical experience through a more formal structure and improved faculty counseling. An appropriate number of electives or selected options should be included. (17b) Counseling of medical students by faculty and others should be directed toward increasing the breadth of clinical experience. Students should be encouraged to choo se experience in disciplines that will not be an integral part of their projected graduate medical education. \" Clauses 3 and 4 have been accomplished and are reflected in other AMA policy, such as D-295.988 , \"Clinical Skills Assessment During Medical School ,\" which reads in part: \"2. Our AMA will work with the Federation of State Medical Boards, National Board of Medical Examiners, state medical societies, state medical boards, and other key stakeholders to pursue the transition from and replacement for the current United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 2 Clinical Skills (CS) examination and the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination (COMLEX) Level 2 - Performance Examination (PE) with a requirement to pass a Liaison Committee on Medical Education -accredited or Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation -accredited medical school - administered, clinical skills examination. \"3. Our AMA will work to: (a) ensure rapid yet carefully considered changes to the current examination process to reduce costs, including travel expenses, as well as time away from educ ational pursuits, through immediate steps by the Federation of State Medical Boards and National Board of Medical Examiners; (b) encourage a significant and expeditious increase in the number of available testing sites; (c) allow CME Rep. 01-A-23 -- page 5 of 20 international students and graduates to take the same examination at any available testing site; (d) engage in a transparent evaluation of basing this examination within our nation's medical schools, rather than administered by an external organization; and (e) include active parti cipation by faculty leaders and assessment experts from U.S. medical schools, as they work to develop new and improved methods of assessing medical student competence for advancement into residency. . . . \"5. Our AMA will continue to work with appropriate stakeholders to assure the processes for assessing clinical skills are evidence -based and most efficiently use the time and financial resources of those being assessed. \"6. Our AMA encourages development of a post -examination feedback system for all USML E test -takers that would: (a) identify areas of satisfactory or better performance; (b) identify areas of suboptimal performance; and (c) give students who fail the exam insight into the areas of unsatisfactory performance on the examination. \" D-295.982 Model Pain Management Program For Medical School Curricula Our AMA will collect, synthesize, and disseminate information about effective educational programs in pain management and palliative care in medical schools and residency programs.

REPORT 02 OF THE COUNCIL ON MEDICAL EDUCATION ( A-23) Financing Medical Education (Resolution 306- A-22) (Reference Committee C) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY As the cost of medical education continues to rise , it is imperative to understand the factors that impact this investment. These factors include the type of institution one attends, the cost of attendance, and a student's education and noneducation debt. Private institutions tend to cost more than public institutions , with private nonprofit institutions being more expensive than private for - profit institutions . Cost of attendance is determined by the published tuition and required fees; books and supplies; and the weighted average cost for room, board, and other expenses for four years at each institution. Education debt encompasses both premedical and medical education debt. Educa tion debt incurred before starting medical school remains remarkably stable, as is the percentage of graduates reporting such debt. While private medical school graduates are slightly less likely to have debt, their individual debt levels are typically higher than public school graduates as private schools tend to be more expensive to attend than public schools . The Council on Medical Education recognizes that cost and debt is not necessarily a 1:1 relationship and believes these factors should not be confl ated. While costs to attend medical school are rising, another interesting trend is also emerging\u2014a decline in the percentage of graduates who have debt. The proportion of those reporting no debt seems to be clustered among students from wealthy backgroun ds. Earlier research supports that household income and education levels are tightly linked in the United States. Specifically, higher levels of education are correlated with higher household income and vice versa. There are also variations in student indebtedness by race and ethnicity. In 2019, Black allopathic and osteopathic medical graduates had the highest median education debt. Asian allopathic and osteopathic medical graduates had the lowest median education debt. In that same year, 91 percent of Bl ack allopathic medical graduates, 84 percent of Hispanic allopathic medical graduates, and 80 percent of American Indian allopathic medical graduates reported having medical education debt compared to 75 percent of white allopathic medical graduates and 61 percent of Asian allopathic medical graduates. Among all osteopathic graduates who reported debt in 2019, 92 percent were Black, 84 percent were Hispanic, 85 percent were white, and 74 percent were Asian. While indebtedness impacts most graduates, the majority do not enter loan forgiveness programs. While the time to pay off debt varies, compensation after residency is enough to repay all levels of educational debt. T he cost of medical education and student debt are likely to be barriers to diversity in the physician workforce and deterrents for potential applicants with fewer financial resources. However, the cost of medical education does not appear to be a factor in limiting the overall size of the applicant pool as the majority applica nts tend to come from backgrounds with higher socioeconomic status. The Council on Medical Education recommends reaffirm ing AMA Policy D- 305.952, \"Medical Student Debt and Career Choice\"; amending Policy D -295.316, \"Management and Leadership for Physicians\" ; amending Policy H -305.925, \"Principles of and Actions to Address Medical Education Costs and Student Debt\" ; and adopting new policy encouraging higher utilization of financial information available through medical education organizations in addition to fe deral, state, and local financial resources.\u00a9 2023 American Medical Association. All rights reserved. REPORT OF THE COUNCIL ON MEDICAL EDUCATION CME Report 02- A-23 Subject: Financing Medical Education (Resolution 306 -A-22) Presented by: John P. Williams , MD, Chair Referred to: Reference Committee C American Medical Association (AMA) Policy D -305.951, \" Medical Education Debt Cancellation 1 in the Face of a Physician Shortage During the COVID -19 Pandemic ,\" directs our AMA to: 2 3 Study the issue of medical education debt cancellation and consider the opportunities for 4 integration of this into a broader solution addressing debt for all medical students and 5 physicians. 6 7 In addition, Resolution 306- A-22, \" Creating a More Accurate Accounting of Medical Education 8 Financial Costs ,\" introduced b y the Illinois Delegation and the American Society of 9 Anesthesiologists, asked that the AMA \"study the costs of medical education, taking into account 10 medical student tuition and accrued loan interest, to come up with a more accurate description of 11 medical education financial costs.\" This item was referred by the House of Delegates (HOD) to 12 explore the issue of debt cancellation further and develop recommendations for broader solutions to 13 medical student and physician indebtedness . This integrated re port is in response to both the policy 14 directive and the referral . 15 16 BACKGROUND 17 18 The price of medical education 19 20 The road to becom ing a physician has increasingly become an expensive one , with each step 21 having associated costs. For some , the road includes private tutoring, test preparation courses , 22 and/or postbaccalaureate premedical p rograms . Beyond tuition and student fees, costs toward 23 becoming a physician also include the Medical College Admission Test\u00ae (MCAT\u00ae); applications to 24 medica l school ; the United States Medical Licensing Examination\u00ae (USMLE\u00ae) and/or the 25 Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination of the United States (COMLEX - 26 USA) ; and applications for residency , board certification, and state licensure. Some physicians also 27 assume responsibility for the cost of their education beginning with their undergraduate education ; 28 this has been factored into the discussion of pre medical education debt to create a more 29 comprehensive description of medical education fina ncial costs . It is also important to emphasize 30 that cost and debt are not necessarily a 1:1 relationship , and the Council believes these factors 31 should not be conflated. 32 33 Several studies have attempted to determine the cost of education for medical students. A study 34 conducted in 1997 at the University of Texas -Houston Medical School found that the annual total 35 cost (instructional, educational, and research) of the educational program was $90,660 per student 36 in the 1994- 95 academic year.1 This same study de veloped a cost -construction model to assess the 37 cost for educating undergraduate medical education (UME ) students at the institution . The study 38 CME Rep. 02- A-23 -- page 2 of 24 identified the cost of the entire program as well as instructional costs (direct -contact teaching), 1 educational costs (instructional costs plus supervision), and milieu costs (educational costs plus 2 research costs) and provides a glimpse into some of the costs tuition covers. Another study that 3 same year reviewed 20 years of published data and determined that total educational resource costs 4 fell into a range of $72,000 to $93,000 per student per year in 1996 dollars, or approximately 5 $136,800 - $176,700 in 2023.2 6 7 The National Center for Education Statistics monitors cost trends for undergraduate institutions. 8 Total cost of attendance (COA) is determined by the published tuition and required fees; books and 9 supplies; and the weighted average cost for room, board, and other expenses for four years at each 10 institution . The average COA can be varied when considering a student's living arrangement (e.g., 11 a student may live on campus; off campus with family; or off campus but not with family). To 12 demonstrate the range in COA for students , the average COA for a full -time student enrolled in a 13 baccalaureate program a t a four-year public institution living off campus with family was $ 14,900 14 in academic year (AY) 2020- 2021. In that same year, the average COA for a full -time student 15 enrolled in a baccalaureate program at a four-year private non profit living off campus, not with 16 family , was $ 54,600.3 Figure 1 further illustrates the range of total costs for baccalaureate 17 programs by type of ins titution and student living situation. 18 Figure 1. Average total cost of attending degree-granting institutio ns for first -time, full-time undergraduate students, by level and control of institution and student living arrangement: Academic year 2020 -21. Reprinted from the National Center for Education Statistics. (2020). Price of attending an undergraduate institu tion. The Condition of Education. Accessed January 2023. https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/pdf/2022/cua_508.pdf . The variation in COA continues through medical school. According to the Association of 19 American Medical Colleges (AAMC), the median four -year COA in 2019 at a public allopathic 20 medical school was $250,222 and $330,180 at a private allopathic medical school .4 For osteopathic 21 medical colleges, in AY 2021 -2022, the average four -year COA at a public osteopathic medical 22 college was $281 ,946 and $ 337,144 at a private osteopathic medical college .5 As of 2022, of the 23 CME Rep. 02- A-23 -- page 3 of 24 total 155 allopathic medical schools, 93 are public and 62 are private.6 Of the 38 accredited 1 colleges of osteopathic medicine, 31 of the schools are private and seven of the schools are public.7 2 3 Data on cost of attenda nce and education debt 4 5 The AAMC utilizes several tools to assess trends related to COA and education debt , including the 6 Tuition and Student Fees Questionnaire (TSF) , the AAMC Medical School Graduation 7 Questionnaire (GQ) and the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) Part 1B Student 8 Financial Aid Questionnaire . The TSF is administered to all allopathic medical schools to assess 9 tuition, fees, and health insurance costs for both resident and nonresident students reported by 10 accredited medical education programs. The GQ is administered annually to all graduating medical 11 students to evaluate the medical school programs and medical student experiences, including 12 financial aid and indebtedness. The L CME Part 1B Student Financial Aid Questionnaire is 13 administered annually to all opathic medical schools and incorporated into the AAMC 's Medical 14 School Profile System to provide schools with benchmarking reports . The American Association of 15 Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (AACOM ) also assesses trends related to COA and education 16 debt through its Annual Osteopathic Medical School Questionnaire and Graduating Seniors 17 Survey. The Osteopathic Medical School Questionnaire is admi nistered to osteopathic medical 18 colleges . 19 20 When discussi ng medical student debt and the resolution of that debt, the terms loan forgiveness 21 and debt cancelation are often used interchangeably. According to the U.S. Federal Student Aid 22 website, the terms \"mean nearly the same thing ,\" with the difference being ma inly in the 23 circumstances surrounding the termination of requirements to repay the loan. 24 25 The type of school a student attends is a factor in determin ing their potential debt level. Further, 26 costs of attending medical school may vary by year at the same school due to fluctuation in tuition 27 and fees and tends to be more expensive in the third and fourth year .8 While p rivate medical school 28 graduates are slightly less likely to have debt, their individual debt levels are typically higher than 29 those of public school graduates as private schools tend to cost more to attend than public schools . 30 Additionally, public schools generally enroll more students . Figure 2 highlights the median COA 31 among private and public schools compared to the education debt of allopathic medical school 32 graduates who attended private and public schools. 33 CME Rep. 02-A-23 -- page 4 of 24 Figure 2. Inflation -adjusted median education debt levels and four -year cost of attendance (COA), 2009 -2019 (in constant 2019 dollars). Reprinted from Youngclaus J, Fresne JA. Physician Education Debt and the Cost to Attend Medical School: 2020 Update. Washington, DC: AAMC; 2020. Accessed January 2023. While costs to attend medical school are rising, another emerging trend indicates a decline in the 1 percentage of graduates who have debt. In 2013, t he AAMC found that 14 percent of graduates had 2 no debt. This percentage nearly doubled to 27 percent in 2019.9 While the proportion of those 3 reporting no debt seems to be clustered among students from wealthy backgrounds, s everal other 4 variables have been identified to explain this decline, including the impact of new allopathic 5 medical schools , changes to federal loan programs, increased use of scholarships, and changes in 6 self-reported parental income. Additionally, a 2021 report by the Council on Medical Education, 7 \"Medical Student Debt and Career Choice,\" revealed that the data in aggregate may conceal the 8 actual debt load faced by individual students and that a significant subset of students have outside 9 funding sources to offset debt. 10 11 Annual levels of premedical school debt, which is education debt incurred before starting medical 12 school, are remarkably stable, as is the percentage of graduates reporting such debt. According to 13 the AAMC GQ, roughly one-third of allopathic medical graduates reported having premedical 14 school debt, and the median premedical school debt amount was exactly $25,000 in each of the 15 past four years. Osteopathic medical graduates report ed higher levels of pre- medical education 16 debt: $51,116 in 2021, $51,230 in 2020, and $52,348 in 2019.10 Figure 3 illustrates the percentage 17 of U.S. allopathic medical school graduates with education, medical school, and premedical school 18 debt from 2010 to 2019. 19 CME Rep. 02- A-23 -- page 5 of 24 Figure 3. Percentage of U.S. medical school graduates with education , medical school, and premedical debt, 2010- 2019 . Reprinted from Youngclaus J, Fresne JA. Physician Education Debt and the Cost to Attend Medical School: 2020 Update. Washington, DC : AAMC; 2020. Accessed January 2023. The education debt of graduates varies by family income level. In 2019, t he AAMC Matriculating 1 Student Questionnaire (MSQ) found that as the level of family income increases, the percentage of 2 funds projected to come from personal/family sources rises and the percentage from loans and 3 scholarships declines. This finding is consistent with data from the AACOM Graduating Seniors 4 Survey. For the past 30 years, data regarding debt and family income have been consistent , with 5 more than half of medical school graduates belonging to families in the top qu intile of U.S. family 6 income. E arlier research supports that household income and education levels are tightly linked in 7 the United States. Specifically, h igher levels of education are correlated with higher household 8 income and vice versa.11,12 This is consistent with the 2019 AAMC GQ data , which found that the 9 higher the family income level, the less likely graduates are to have premedical debt . Figure 4 10 illustrates the relationship between family income and premedical debt. 11 CME Rep. 02- A-23 -- page 6 of 24 Figure 4 . Percentage of 2019 m edical school graduates with premedical debt and m edian premedical debt amount by quintile of family income. Reprinted from Youngclaus J, Fresne JA. Physician Education Debt and the Cost to Attend Medical School: 2020 Update. Washington, DC: AAMC; 2020. Accessed January 2023. There are also variations in student indebtedness by race and ethnicity. In 2019, 91 percent of 1 Black allopathic medical graduates, 84 percent of Hispanic allopathic medical graduates , and 80 2 percent of American Indian allopathic medical graduates reported having medical education debt 3 compared to 75 percent of white allopathic medical gr aduates and 61 percent of Asian allopathic 4 medical graduates. Among allopathic medical school graduates who reported multiple 5 combinations of race and ethnicity or \"other ,\" 71 percent reported having educational debt.1 In that 6 same year and among all osteopathic graduates who reported debt , 92 percent were Black, 84 7 percent were Hispanic, 85 percent were white, and 74 percent were Asian. Those who indicated 8 they were American Indian and Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander or multiple 9 races were categorized as \"all others\" and in this group 74 percent reported debt.5 Due to the 10 limited number of AI/NA osteopathic medical graduates, their median education debt is unknown. 11 12 In 2019, Black allopathic and osteo pathic medical graduates had the highest median education 13 debt, of $230,000 and $304,908, respectively . Asian allopathic and oste opathic medical graduates 14 had the lowest median education debt , at $180,000 and $229,921, respectively. Hispanic allopathic 15 and osteopathic medical graduates had median education debt of $190,000 and $299,946, 16 respectively . White allopathic and osteopathic medical graduates had a median education debt of 17 $200,000 and $270,000, respectively . AI/AN allopathic medical g raduates had the second highest 18 median education debt , at $212,375.1,5 19 20 The Council on Medical Education recently reported that c laims that education debt influences 21 specialty choice are unfounded and \"a comprehensive review of the academic literature yielded 22 numerous research reports indicating little to no connection between specialty choice and economic 23 factors such as debt and income potential.13 Phillips et al. found that \" students from lower -income 24 families are more likely to eventually practice primary care . Additionally, public school graduates 25 were 30 percent more likely to choose primary care and twice as likely to select family medicine\" 26 as a subspecialty.14 Additionally, Kahn and Nelling found that \"pursuing a medical degree is 27 financially beneficial\" and \"the numbers of physicians graduating each year has begun to increase 28 due to gradual expansion of class sizes and the establishment of new medical schools.\"15 For 29 instance, 16 allopathic medical schools, and 12 osteopathic medical schools have opened in the 30 past 10 years . This finding is further supported by the AAMC and AACOM, as both have 31 witness ed an increase in the number of applicants and overall enrollments over the last decade for 32 allopathic and osteopathic medical school pro grams.16,17 33 34 Data from the AAMC demonstrate that the number of applicants to allopathic medical schools has 35 increased from 48,014 in AY 2013- 14 to 62,443 in AY2021- 22 for an increase of 30 percent . For 36 CME Rep. 02- A-23 -- page 7 of 24 the same period, matriculants increased from 20,055 to 22,666 for an increase of 13 percent . The 1 same data demonstrate a matriculant to applicant ratio of 0.41 in 2013 -14 decreasing to 0.36 in 2 2021- 22 despite an increase in the number of schools and total number of admissions. Collectively, 3 these dat a suggest that increasing cost of medical education and rising student debt are not limiting 4 interest or enrollment in medical education. 5 6 Data on Noneducation Debt 7 8 The AAMC GQ also analyzes noneducation debt in five categories: credit card, car, residen cy 9 relocation loan, mortgage , and other . The AAMC GQ data from 2019 highlight that noneducation 10 debt is not common and the median amounts (excluding mortgages) are significantly lower than the 11 median education debt amounts . Figure 5 provides an over view of the noneducation debt data for 12 allopathic medical school graduates in 2019. 13 Figure 5. Noneducation d ebt data for m edical school graduates, 2019 . Reprinted from Youngclaus J, Fresne JA. Physician Education Debt and the Cost to Attend Medical School: 2020 Update. Washington, DC: AAMC; 2020. Accessed January 2023. The following combinations were the most reported in the subset of graduates with noneducation 14 debt: 45 percent reported having credit card debt only, 18 percent reported having car debt only, 17 15 percent reported having both credit card and car debt, and 7 percent reported having both credit 16 card and residency relocation debt. All other possible combinations occurre d less than 3 percent of 17 the time. These findings were consistent with the 2018 data. Additionally, nonmortgage, 18 noneducation debt was more common among graduates who identified as married or hav ing 19 dependents . Figure 6 divides allopathic medical graduates into four groups based on their marital 20 status and whether they have dependent s and shows their debt characteristics . 21 CME Rep. 02- A-23 -- page 8 of 24 Figure 6.

Physician Education Debt and the Cost to Attend Medical School: 2020 Update. Washington, DC: AAMC; 2020. Accessed January 2023. Another pattern has emerged while surveying medical education debt. That is, t he average level of 1 medical school debt per graduate increases as the types of debt held increases. Only 30 percent of 2 medical school graduates have no medical school debt at all . For those who do have debt, 36 3 percent have medical school debt only, 19 percent have medical school debt and premedical school 4 debt, and 9 percent have medical school debt, premedical school debt , and noneducation debt. Only 5 6 percent of graduates have both medical school debt and noneducation debt. Figure 7 shows the 6 average amount of debt among each of these groups. 7 CME Rep. 02- A-23 -- page 9 of 24 Figure 7. Average medical school debt by type of debt held by 2019 indebted graduates.

Understanding the impact of accrued inter est on debt 4 5 Paying off education debt takes a considerable amount of time. A 2019 survey of physicians who 6 had graduate d from medical school in 2015 or earlier found that 35 percent had paid off their 7 student loans . Of the respondents that still reported debt, 80 percent had more than $100,000 in 8 debt and 32 percent had more than $250,000.18 Assessing the impact of accrued interest on 9 education debt is complicated, beginning with interest rates. Congress sets the int erest rates for 10 federal student loans , while private lenders establish their own rates . Borrowers also have the 11 option of fixed or variable rates for their loans. Fixed loan rates re main the same for the duration of 12 CME Rep. 02-A-23 -- page 10 of 24 the repayment term. Variable interest rates are based on debt market conditions and can fluctuate 1 over time. Like fixed rate loans, payments on variable rate loans are initially applied to the interest 2 and then the principle. Variable interest rates tend to initially be lower than fixed interest rates , but 3 they can increase significantly depending on market conditions , which makes them a risk ier option 4 for borrowers.19 At the time of this report, federal student loans offer fixed interest rates of 6.54 5 percent or 7.54 percent , while private lenders offer fixed or variable interest rates ranging between 6 3.5 to 15 percent .20 If a borrower is on an e xtended payment plan or has deferred their payments, 7 the interest continues to accrue. Negative amortization occurs when the monthly interes t accruing 8 is higher than the monthly loan payment one makes. Negative amor tization can occur during 9 residency ; however, with rare exceptions, compensation after residency is enough to repay all 10 levels of educational debt. 11 12 Mechanisms to pay for medical education 13 14 As discussed in an earlier Council report on medical student debt and career choice, the relat ive 15 lack of financial education among medical students is a concern. A study of first - and fourth- year 16 medical students by Jayakumar et al. found low levels of financial literacy and lack of preparedness 17 for managing personal finances, including strategies for effective saving and investing and practice 18 management.21 Equally concerning, the study's authors describe the lack of improvement in 19 financial literacy between entering and graduating medical students, regardless of whether their 20 medical school offer ed such education. 21 22 The AAMC Financial Information, Resources, Services, and Tools ( FIRST ) program provides free 23 resources, including publications, videos, webinars, infographics, and charts to help students and 24 residents make informed financial decisions related to their education. In addition, colleges and 25 universities have offices of financial aid to support and assist stu dents with their financial concerns. 26 Sallie Mae provides guidance on how to create a plan to pay for aspiring physicians. They offer a 27 three -step approach to help inform students how to control costs associated with medical school. 28 The model below outlines these three steps and includes a fourth step to include loan forgiveness 29 programs, which have been historically underutilized. 30 Figure 8. Creating a plan to pay for medical school Source: Sallie Mae, Paying for 20, 2023. Loan f orgiveness opportunities and limitations 31 32 There are a variety of loan forgiveness programs at the federal, state and local level. The most 33 popular program among medical school graduates is the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF ) 34 program. A 2017 Council report , \"Expansion of Public Service Loan Forgiveness,\" provides 35 additional background on the PSLF program, which promises cancella tion of remaining federal 36 CME Rep. 02- A-23 -- page 11 of 24 student loan balances after 10 years' worth of payments made while employed by an eligible 1 nonprofit or government agency. Payment amounts during the 10- year period are income -based. 2 Physicians c an use their time in residency towa rd the 10 -year requirement if they ma ke regular 3 payments during those years and their employer i s a nonprofit teaching hospital. Following 4 residency, physicians can continue in a nonprofit for the remaining payment years. 5 6 While indebtedness impacts most graduates, the majority do not enter loan forgiveness programs. 7 Only 34 percent of indebted allopathic medical graduates report plans to pursue PSLF. Among 8 indebted osteopathic medical graduates, this percentage is higher , with 50 percent reporting they 9 will participate in a loan forgiveness program and, of those, 70 percent report ing they plan to 10 pursue PSLF.2,5 Figure 9 breaks down the various details of indebted allopathic medical graduates ' 11 plans to enter loan forgiveness programs. 12 Figure 9. Various Details of Indebted Graduates by Plans to Enter a Loan Forgiveness Program, 2019 Only. Reprinted from Youngclaus J, Fresne JA. Physician Education Debt and the Cost to Attend Medical School: 2020 Update. Washington, DC: AAMC; 2020. Accessed January 2023. Note: Total percentages might not equal 100 percent due to rounding. The \"Other Federal\" category is for the National Health Service Corps (NHSC), the Indian Health Service Corps, the armed services (Navy, Army, Air Force), and other uniformed services. Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) is a Department of Education program. The business of medical education 13 14 The true cost of undergraduate medical education is difficult to determine for several reasons. 15 Medical education programs are typically imbedded in increasingly complex medical schools. 16 Medical schools often have multiple mission areas and educational program s that share common 17 resources and infrastructure . Faculty within the schools often have roles and responsibilities 18 beyond the educational program , with some having minimal contribution to the education of 19 medical students. The funding models for schools an d faculty vary widely, often with funds 20 flowing in opposing directions between medical schools and clinical affiliates. Teaching students, 21 CME Rep. 02- A-23 -- page 12 of 24 engagement in faculty governance of the educational program, faculty development as teachers, 1 and other roles result in decreased clinical and research productivity , which in turn results in 2 opportunity cost for the medical school, clinical affiliates, and other providers. The models for 3 funding these opportunity costs vary across and within institutions , renderin g an accurate cost 4 analysis difficult at best. 5 6 The effects of the increasing cost of medical education and increasing student debt on health care 7 costs in general are even more difficult to determine but may be negligible in the totality of the 8 nation' s health care costs. As noted above, there are opportunity costs for clinical faculty who teach 9 medical students by way of decreased productivity. Approximately 18 percent of physicians in the 10 U.S. have faculty appointments ,22 but the number of these physicia ns who make a significant 11 contribution to medical student teaching is unknown, as is the percent age of their time spent 12 teaching medic al students and the funding source for these activities. Further, physician incomes 13 make up only 10 percent of total health care spending.23 Taking all these factors into consideration, 14 educating medical student s probably has minimal impact on current health care costs. There are 15 also direct costs incurred to support medical students in clinical settings, but these are also very 16 small in the context of a health system. Downstream, medical school graduates in clinical practice 17 have little control over clinical inco me by way of reimbursements , as these are largely set by third 18 party pay ers. In summary, while the actual effe ct of the cost of medical student education on the 19 health care system is not known, the contribution is probably relatively small in comparison to 20 other drivers of health care costs. 21 22 While the cost of medical education and student debt are likely to be barriers to diversity in the 23 physician workforce and deterrents for potential applicants with fewer financial resources, the cost 24 of medical education does not appear to be a factor in limiting t he overall size of the applicant pool. 25 26 Return on educational investment for physicians 27 28 Another consideration is the reality and perception of educational debt for physicians versus 29 physician income , compared to nonphysicians. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 30 May 2021 report on Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics, the annual mean income for 31 physicians in general was $252,480, with a range across specialties of $198,420 for pediatricians to 32 $353,970 for cardiologists. By comparison, the average income for four -year college degree 33 graduates was $59,600, versus $44,100 for an associate degree and $36,600 for high school 34 graduates.24 For physicians, using the general annual mean income and a 30 -year full-time practice 35 life, the projected lifetime income amount would be $7. 574 million in 2021 dollars. By 36 comparison, the average tuition (not COA) for an MBA degree in 2022 was $62,460, and the 37 annual average salary for holders of MBA degrees was app roximately $115,000,25,26 for a projected 38 30-year lifetime income of $3.450 million in 2022 dollars. Further, debt repayment as a percentage 39 of income is highly likely to decrease over time, as overall income increases with inflation and 40 cost-of-living inc reases in income, while the amount of fixed loan repayments remains constant. 41 Taken in the context of anticipated income and the effects of inflation on the value and payments of 42 long- term loans, medical education costs and student loans are still a good long- term investment. 43 44 Of course, these calculations do not take into consideration the length of the training program and 45 the positive and negative effects of medical education on lifestyle and family. Nor do they factor 46 the disproportionate effec t that the cost of medical education, and debt, may have on the 47 development of a diverse workforce. But the data clearly show that the investment in medical 48 education, even with educational debt, is a good one. Given the many benefits, both tangible (e.g., 49 financial) and intangible (societal standing afforded physicians in the U.S.), the medical 50 community and society in general must consider if the cost of medical education and educational 51 CME Rep. 02-A-23 -- page 13 of 24 debt of medical students is misaligned with the ability to repay the debt and with the levels of 1 income that typically follow. 2 3 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS 4 5 Like medical school tuition, medical education debt is rising. A closer look at the data 6 demonstrates that rising education debt represents a greater burden for specific demographics of 7 medical school graduates, including those whose are in the lower quintiles of U.S. family income 8 and marginalized racial groups. Efforts to diversify the physician workforce may benefit by 9 focusing support for these groups most negatively impacted , as their experiences may contribute to 10 improve both quality of care and acces s to care. That said, there is little solid evidence for a strong 11 link between debt and career choice. Although the average amount of education debt for medical 12 school graduates is in the six figures, the most indebted medical school graduates do not enter loan 13 forgiveness programs and can repay any amount borrowed regardless of specialty practice or where 14 they live, in part due to the flexible nature of federal repayment plans that link payments to income 15 and expectations for income after completion of tra ining. 27 16 17 The AMA has extensive policy in support of debt relief programs , including federal programs such 18 as the National Health Service Corps and Indian Health Service, along with comparable programs 19 from states and the private sector, in that \"the costs of medical education should never be a barrier 20 to the pursuit of a career in medicine nor to the decision to practice in a given specialty\" (H - 21 305.925, \"Principles of and Actions to Address Medical Education Costs and Student Debt\"). 22 Additionally, th e AMA has numerous policies that address medical schools and the cost of medical 23 education, including tuition and loans. Policy H-305.925(16) states that the AMA will continue to 24 study medical education financing, so as to identify long- term strategies to mitigate the debt burden 25 for medical students. The issue of medical education financial costs was recently studied in Council 26 on Medical Education R eport 4 -N-21, \"Medical Student Debt and Career Choice,\" which was 27 adopted at the November 2021 Meeting. Whil e the AMA also advocates for the \"development of 28 personal financial liter acy capabilities\" (D-295.316, \" Management and Leadership for 29 Physicians\"), t here continues to be a need to increase medical students ' financial literacy as they 30 plan for their future. In support of this need, the AMA continues to help individual medical 31 students and physicians gain this financial education by offering medical school debt management 32 solutions through Laurel Road as well as other loans and financi al services . 33 34 The Council on Medical Education therefore recommends that the following recommendat ions be 35 adopted in lieu of Resolution 306-A-22 and the remainder of this report be filed: 36 37 1. That Policy D- 305.952, \" Medical Student Debt and Career Choice,\" be reaffirmed. (Reaffirm 38 HOD Policy) 39 40 2. That Policy H -305.925, \"Principles of and Actions to Address Medical Education Costs and 41 Student Debt ,\" be amended by addition of a new point (23), to read \"(23) continue to monitor 42 opportunities to reduce additional expense burden upon medical students including reduced- 43 cost or free programs for residency applications, virtual or hybrid interviews, and other cost- 44 reduction initiatives aimed at reducing non-educational debt.\" (Amend HOD Policy) 45 46 3. That our AMA encourage medical students, residents, fellows and physicians in practice to 47 take advantage of available loan forgiveness programs and grants and scholarships that have 48 been historically underutilized, as well as financial information and resources available through 49 the Association of American Medical Colleges and American Association of Colleges of 50 Osteopathic Medicine, as required by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education and 51 CME Rep. 02-A-23 -- page 14 of 24 Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation , and resources available at the federal, state 1 and local levels . (New HOD Policy) 2 3 4. That Policy D -305.984 (5), \"Reduction in Student Loan Interest Rates,\" be rescinded, as having 4 been fulfilled by this report: 5 6 \"Work with appropriate organizations, such as the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical 7 Education and the Association of American Medical Colleges, to collect data and report on 8 student indebtedness that includes total loan costs at completion of graduate medica l education 9 training.\" (Rescind HOD Policy) 10 Fiscal note: minimal CME Rep. 02-A-23 -- page 15 of 24 APPENDIX: RELEVANT AMA POLICIES Principles and Actions to Address Medical Education Costs and Student Debt H-305.925 The costs of medical education should never be a barrier to the pursuit of a career in medicine nor to the decision to practice in a given specialty. To help address this issue, our American Medical Association (AMA) will: 1. Collaborate with members of the Federation and the medical education community, and with other interested organizations, to address the cost of medical education and medical student debt through public- and private -sector advocacy. 2. Vigorously advocate for and support expansion of and adequate funding for federal scholarship and loan repayment pr ograms --such as those from the National Health Service Corps, Indian Health Service, Armed Forces, and Department of Veterans Affairs, and for comparable programs from states and the private sector --to promote practice in underserved areas, the military, a nd academic medicine or clinical research. 3. Encourage the expansion of National Institutes of Health programs that provide loan repayment in exchange for a commitment to conduct targeted research. 4. Advocate for increased funding for the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program to assure adequate funding of primary care within the National Health Service Corps, as well as to permit: (a) inclusion of all medical specialties in need, and (b) service in clinical settings that care for the unders erved but are not necessarily located in health professions shortage areas. 5. Encourage the National Health Service Corps to have repayment policies that are consistent with other federal loan forgiveness programs, thereby decreasing the amount of loans i n default and increasing the number of physicians practicing in underserved areas. 6. Work to reinstate the economic hardship deferment qualification criterion known as the \"20/220 pathway,\" and support alternate mechanisms that better address the financia l needs of trainees with educational debt. 7. Advocate for federal legislation to support the creation of student loan savings accounts that allow for pre-tax dollars to be used to pay for student loans. 8. Work with other concerned organizations to advocate for legislation and regulation that would result in favorable terms and conditions for borrowing and for loan repayment, and would permit 100% tax deductibility of interest on student loans and elimination of taxes on aid from service- based programs. 9. Encourage the creation of private -sector financial aid programs with favorable interest rates or service obligations (such as community- or institution -based loan repayment programs or state medical society loan programs). 10. Support stable funding for m edical education programs to limit excessive tuition increases, and collect and disseminate information on medical school programs that cap medical education debt, including the types of debt management education that are provided. 11. Work with state medi cal societies to advocate for the creation of either tuition caps or, if caps are not feasible, pre-defined tuition increases, so that medical students will be aware of their tuition and fee costs for the total period of their enrollment. 12. Encourage medical schools to (a) Study the costs and benefits associated with non- traditional instructional formats (such as online and distance learning, and combined baccalaureate/MD or DO programs) to determine if cost savings to medical schools and to medical stude nts could be realized without jeopardizing the quality of medical education; (b) Engage in fundraising activities to increase the availability of scholarship support, with the support of the Federation, medical schools, and state and specialty medical societies, and develop or enhance financial aid opportunities for medical students, such as self -managed, low -interest loan programs; (c) Cooperate with postsecondary institutions to establish collaborative debt counseling for entering first- year medical stude nts; (d) Allow for flexible scheduling for medical students who encounter financial difficulties that can be remedied only by employment, and consider creating opportunities for paid CME Rep. 02- A-23 -- page 16 of 24 employment for medical students; (e) Counsel individual medical student b orrowers on the status of their indebtedness and payment schedules prior to their graduation; (f) Inform students of all government loan opportunities and disclose the reasons that preferred lenders were chosen; (g) Ensure that all medical student fees are earmarked for specific and well -defined purposes, and avoid charging any overly broad and ill -defined fees, such as but not limited to professional fees; (h) Use their collective purchasing power to obtain discounts for their students on necessary medical equipment, textbooks, and other educational supplies; (i) Work to ensure stable funding, to eliminate the need for increases in tuition and fees to compensate for unanticipated decreases in other sources of revenue; mid- year and retroactive tuition increa ses should be opposed. 13. Support and encourage state medical societies to support further expansion of state loan repayment programs, particularly those that encompass physicians in non- primary care specialties. 14. Take an active advocacy role during re authorization of the Higher Education Act and similar legislation, to achieve the following goals: (a) Eliminating the single holder rule; (b) Making the availability of loan deferment more flexible, including broadening the definition of economic hardship and expanding the period for loan deferment to include the entire length of residency and fellowship training; (c) Retaining the option of loan forbearance for residents ineligible for loan deferment; (d) Including, explicitly, dependent care expenses in the definition of the \"cost of attendance\"; (e) Including room and board expenses in the definition of tax- exempt scholarship income; (f) Continuing the federal Direct Loan Consolidation program, including the ability to \"lock in\" a fixed interest rate, an d giving consideration to grace periods in renewals of federal loan programs; (g) Adding the ability to refinance Federal Consolidation Loans; (h) Eliminating the cap on the student loan interest deduction; (i) Increasing the income limits for taking the i nterest deduction; (j) Making permanent the education tax incentives that our AMA successfully lobbied for as part of Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001; (k) Ensuring that loan repayment programs do not place greater burdens upon mar ried couples than for similarly situated couples who are cohabitating; (l) Increasing efforts to collect overdue debts from the present medical student loan programs in a manner that would not interfere with the provision of future loan funds to medical st udents. 15. Continue to work with state and county medical societies to advocate for adequate levels of medical school funding and to oppose legislative or regulatory provisions that would result in significant or unplanned tuition increases. 16. Continue to study medical education financing, so as to identify long- term strategies to mitigate the debt burden of medical students, and monitor the short -and long -term impact of the economic environment on the availability of institutional and external sources o f financial aid for medical students, as well as on choice of specialty and practice location. 17. Collect and disseminate information on successful strategies used by medical schools to cap or reduce tuition. 18. Continue to monitor the availability of and encourage medical schools and residency/fellowship programs to (a) provide financial aid opportunities and financial planning/debt management counseling to medical students and resident/fellow physicians; (b) work with key stakeholders to develop and dis seminate standardized information on these topics for use by medical students, resident/fellow physicians, and young physicians; and (c) share innovative approaches with the medical education community. 19. Seek federal legislation or rule changes that wou ld stop Medicare and Medicaid decertification of physicians due to unpaid student loan debt. The AMA believes that it is improper for physicians not to repay their educational loans, but assistance should be available to those physicians who are experienci ng hardship in meeting their obligations. 20. Related to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program, our AMA supports increased medical student and physician participation in the program, and will: (a) Advocate that all resident/fellow physicians have access to PSLF during their training years; (b) Advocate against a monetary cap on PSLF and other federal loan forgiveness programs; (c) Work with the United CME Rep. 02-A-23 -- page 17 of 24 States Department of Education to ensure that any cap on loan forgiveness under PSLF be at lea st equal to the principal amount borrowed; (d) Ask the United States Department of Education to include all terms of PSLF in the contractual obligations of the Master Promissory Note; (e) Encourage the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) to require residency/fellowship programs to include within the terms, conditions, and benefits of program appointment information on the employer's PSLF program qualifying status; (f) Advocate that the profit status of a physician's training institu tion not be a factor for PSLF eligibility; (g) Encourage medical school financial advisors to counsel wise borrowing by medical students, in the event that the PSLF program is eliminated or severely curtailed; (h) Encourage medical school financial advisor s to increase medical student engagement in service- based loan repayment options, and other federal and military programs, as an attractive alternative to the PSLF in terms of financial prospects as well as providing the opportunity to provide care in medi cally underserved areas; (i) Strongly advocate that the terms of the PSLF that existed at the time of the agreement remain unchanged for any program participant in the event of any future restrictive changes; (j) Monitor the denial rates for physician appl icants to the PSLF; (k) Undertake expanded federal advocacy, in the event denial rates for physician applicants are unexpectedly high, to encourage release of information on the basis for the high denial rates, increased transparency and streamlining of program requirements, consistent and accurate communication between loan servicers and borrowers, and clear expectations regarding oversight and accountability of the loan servicers responsible for the program; (l) Work with the United States Department of E ducation to ensure that applicants to the PSLF and its supplemental extensions, such as Temporary Expanded Public Service Loan Forgiveness (TEPSLF), are provided with the necessary information to successfully complete the program(s) in a timely manner; and (m) Work with the United States Department of Education to ensure that individuals who would otherwise qualify for PSLF and its supplemental extensions, such as TEPSLF, are not disqualified from the program(s). 21. Advocate for continued funding of progra ms including Income -Driven Repayment plans for the benefit of reducing medical student load burden. 22. Strongly advocate for the passage of legislation to allow medical students, residents and fellows who have education loans to qualify for interest- free deferment on their student loans while serving in a medical internship, residency, or fellowship program, as well as permitting the conversion of currently unsubsidized Stafford and Graduate Plus loans to interest free status for the duration of undergraduate and graduate medical education. Cost and Financing of Medical Education and Availability of First-Year Residency Positions H- 305.988 Our AMA: 1. believes that medical schools should further develop an information system based on common definitions to display the costs associated with undergraduate medical education; 2. in studying the financing of medical schools, supports identification of those elements that have implications for the supply of physicians in the future; 3. believes that the primary goal of medical school is to educate students to become physicians and that despite the economies necessary to survive in an era of decreased funding, teaching functions must be maintained even if other commitments need to be reduced; 4. believes that a decr ease in student enrollment in medical schools may not result in proportionate reduction of expenditures by the school if quality of education is to be maintained; 5. supports continued improvement of the AMA information system on expenditures of medical students to determine which items are included, and what the ranges of costs are; 6. supports continued study of the relationship between medical student indebtedness and career choice; CME Rep. 02-A-23 -- page 18 of 24 7. believes medical schools should avoid counterbalancing reductions in revenues from other sources through tuition and student fee increases that compromise their ability to attract students from diverse backgrounds; 8. supports expansion of the number of affiliations with appropriate hospitals by institutions with accredit ed residency programs; 9. encourages for profit- hospitals to participate in medical education and training; 10. supports AMA monitoring of trends that may lead to a reduction in compensation and benefits provided to resident physicians; 11. encourages all sponsoring institutions to make financial information available to help residents manage their educational indebtedness; and 12. will advocate that resident and fellow trainees should not be financially responsible for their training. Reduction in Student Loan Interest Rates D-305.984 1. Our AMA will actively lobby for legislation aimed at establishing an affordable student loan structure with a variable interest rate capped at no more than 5.0%. 2. Our AMA will work in collaboration with other health profession organizations to advocate for a reduction of the fixed interest rate of the Stafford student loan program and the Graduate PLUS loan program. 3. Our AMA will consider the total cost of loans including loan origination fees and benefits of federal loans such as tax deductibility or loan forgiveness when advocating for a reduction in student loan interest rates. 4. Our AMA will advocate for policies which lead to equal or less expensive loans (in terms of loan benefits, origination fees, and interest rates) for Grad -PLUS loans as this would change the status quo of high-borrowers paying higher interest rates and fees in addition to having a higher overall loan burden. 5. Our AMA will work with appropriate organizations, such as the Accreditat ion Council for Graduate Medical Education and the Association of American Medical Colleges, to collect data and report on student indebtedness that includes total loan costs at completion of graduate medical education training. Principles of and Actions to Address Primary Care Workforce H-200.949 1. Our patients require a sufficient, well-trained supply of primary care physicians --family physicians, general internists, general pediatricians, and obstetricians/gynecologists --to meet the nation's current and projected demand for health care services. 2. To help accomplish this critical goal, our American Medical Association (AMA) will work with a variety of key stakeholders, to include federal and state legislators and regulatory bodies; national and state specialty societies and medical associations, including those representing primary care fields; and accreditation, certification, licensing, and regulatory bodies from across the continuum of medical education (undergraduate, graduate, and continuing medica l education). 3. Through its work with these stakeholders, our AMA will encourage development and dissemination of innovative models to recruit medical students interested in primary care, train primary care physicians, and enhance both the perception and the reality of primary care practice, to encompass the following components: a) Changes to medical school admissions and recruitment of medical students to primary care specialties, including counseling of medical students as they develop their career plan s; b) Curriculum changes throughout the medical education continuum; c) Expanded financial aid and debt relief options; d) Financial and logistical support for primary care practice, including adequate reimbursement, and enhancements to the practice environment to ensure professional satisfaction and practice sustainability; and e) Support for research and advocacy related to primary care. CME Rep. 02- A-23 -- page 19 of 24 4. Admissions and recruitment: The medical school admissions process should reflect the specific institution's mission. Those schools with missions that include primary care should consider those predictor variables among applicants that are associated with choice of these specialties. 5. Medical schools, through continued and expanded recruitment and outreach activities i nto secondary schools, colleges, and universities, should develop and increase the pool of applicants likely to practice primary care by seeking out those students whose profiles indicate a likelihood of practicing in primary care and underserved areas, wh ile establishing strict guidelines to preclude discrimination. 6. Career counseling and exposure to primary care: Medical schools should provide to students career counseling related to the choice of a primary care specialty, and ensure that primary care physicians are well -represented as teachers, mentors, and role models to future physicians. 7. Financial assistance programs should be created to provide students with primary care experiences in ambulatory settings, especially in underserved areas. These could include funded preceptorships or summer work/study opportunities. 8. Curriculum: Voluntary efforts to develop and expand both undergraduate and graduate medical education programs to educate primary care physicians in increasing numbers should be cont inued. The establishment of appropriate administrative units for all primary care specialties should be encouraged. 9. Medical schools with an explicit commitment to primary care should structure the curriculum to support this objective. At the same time, all medical schools should be encouraged to continue to change their curriculum to put more emphasis on primary care. 10. All four years of the curriculum in every medical school should provide primary care experiences for all students, to feature increasi ng levels of student responsibility and use of ambulatory and community -based settings. 11. Federal funding, without coercive terms, should be available to institutions needing financial support to expand resources for both undergraduate and graduate medic al education programs designed to increase the number of primary care physicians. Our AMA will advocate for public (federal and state) and private payers to a) develop enhanced funding and related incentives from all sources to provide education for medica l students and resident/fellow physicians, respectively, in progressive, community- based models of integrated care focused on quality and outcomes (such as the patient -centered medical home and the chronic care model) to enhance primary care as a career ch oice; b) fund and foster innovative pilot programs that change the current approaches to primary care in undergraduate and graduate medical education, especially in urban and rural underserved areas; and c) evaluate these efforts for their effectiveness in increasing the number of students choosing primary care careers and helping facilitate the elimination of geographic, racial, and other health care disparities. 12. Medical schools and teaching hospitals in underserved areas should promote medical student and resident/fellow physician rotations through local family health clinics for the underserved, with financial assistance to the clinics to compensate their teaching efforts. 13. The curriculum in primary care residency programs and training sites should be consistent with the objective of training generalist physicians. Our AMA will encourage the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education to (a) support primary care residency programs, including community hospital -based programs, and (b) develo p an accreditation environment and novel pathways that promote innovations in graduate medical education, using progressive, community- based models of integrated care focused on quality and outcomes (such as the patient -centered medical home and the chroni c care model). 14. The visibility of primary care faculty members should be enhanced within the medical school, and positive attitudes toward primary care among all faculty members should be encouraged. 15. Support for practicing primary care physicians: A dministrative support mechanisms should be developed to assist primary care physicians in the logistics of their practices, along with enhanced CME Rep. 02- A-23 -- page 20 of 24 efforts to reduce administrative activities unrelated to patient care, to help ensure professional satisfaction and practice sustainability. 16. There should be increased financial incentives for physicians practicing primary care, especially those in rural and urban underserved areas, to include scholarship or loan repayment programs, relief of professional liabili ty burdens, and Medicaid case management programs, among others. Our AMA will advocate to state and federal legislative and regulatory bodies, among others, for development of public and/or private incentive programs, and expansion and increased funding for existing programs, to further encourage practice in underserved areas and decrease the debt load of primary care physicians. The imposition of specific outcome targets should be resisted, especially in the absence of additional support to the schools. 17. Our AMA will continue to advocate, in collaboration with relevant specialty societies, for the recommendations from the AMA/Specialty Society RVS Update Committee (RUC) related to reimbursement for E&M services and coverage of services related to care co ordination, including patient education, counseling, team meetings and other functions; and work to ensure that private payers fully recognize the value of E&M services, incorporating the RUC -recommended increases adopted for the most current Medicare RBRV S. 18. Our AMA will advocate for public (federal and state) and private payers to develop physician reimbursement systems to promote primary care and specialty practices in progressive, community -based models of integrated care focused on quality and outcomes such as the patient - centered medical home and the chronic care model consistent with current AMA Policies H - 160.918 and H -160.919. 19. There should be educational support systems for primary care physicians, especially those practicing in underserved a reas. 20. Our AMA will urge urban hospitals, medical centers, state medical associations, and specialty societies to consider the expanded use of mobile health care capabilities. 21. Our AMA will encourage the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to explore the use of telemedicine to improve access to and support for urban primary care practices in underserved settings. 22. Accredited continuing medical education providers should promote and establish continuing medical education courses i n performing, prescribing, interpreting and reinforcing primary care services. 23. Practicing physicians in other specialties --particularly those practicing in underserved urban or rural areas --should be provided the opportunity to gain specific primary ca re competencies through short -term preceptorships or postgraduate fellowships offered by departments of family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, etc., at medical schools or teaching hospitals. In addition, part -time training should be encouraged, to allow physicians in these programs to practice concurrently, and further research into these concepts should be encouraged. 24. Our AMA supports continued funding of Public Health Service Act, Title VII, Section 747, and encourages advocacy in this regard by AMA members and the public. 25. Research: Analysis of state and federal financial assistance programs should be undertaken, to determine if these programs are having the desired workforce effects, particularly for students from disadvantaged groups and those that are underrepresented in medicine, and to gauge the impact of these programs on elimination of geographic, racial, and other health care disparities. Additional research should identify the factors that deter students and physicians from choosin g and remaining in primary care disciplines. Further, our AMA should continue to monitor trends in the choice of a primary care specialty and the availability of primary care graduate medical education positions. The results of these and related research e ndeavors should support and further refine AMA policy to enhance primary care as a career choice. CME Rep. 02-A-23 -- page 21 of 24 Diversity in the Physician Workforce and Access to Care D -200.982 Our AMA will: (1) continue to advocate for programs that promote diversity in the US medical workforce, such as pipeline programs to medical schools; (2) continue to advocate for adequate funding for federal and state programs that promote interest in practice in underserved areas, such as those under Title VII of the Public Health Service Act, scholarship and loan repayment programs under the National Health Services Corps and state programs, state Area Health Education Centers, and Conrad 30, and also encourage the development of a centralized database of scholarship and loan repayment programs; and (3) continue to study the factors that support and those that act against the choice to practice in an underserved area, and report the findings and solutions at the 2008 Interim Meeting. Strategies for Enhancing Diversity in the Physician Workfor ce D-200.985 1. Our AMA, independently and in collaboration with other groups such as the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), will actively work and advocate for funding at the federal and state levels and in the private sector to support the following: (a) Pipeline programs to prepare and motivate members of underrepresented groups to enter medical school; (b) Diversity or minority affairs offices at medical schools; (c) Financial aid programs for students from groups that are underrepresented in medicine; and (d) Financial support programs to recruit and develop faculty members from underrepresented groups. 2. Our AMA will work to obtain full restoration and protection of federal Title VII funding, and similar state funding programs, for the C enters of Excellence Program, Health Careers Opportunity Program, Area Health Education Centers, and other programs that support physician training, recruitment, and retention in geographically- underserved areas. 3. Our AMA will take a leadership role in efforts to enhance diversity in the physician workforce, including engaging in broad-based efforts that involve partners within and beyond the medical profession and medical education community. 4. Our AMA will encourage the Liaison Committee on Medical Edu cation to assure that medical schools demonstrate compliance with its requirements for a diverse student body and faculty. 5. Our AMA will develop an internal education program for its members on the issues and possibilities involved in creating a diverse physician population. 6. Our AMA will provide on- line educational materials for its membership that address diversity issues in patient care including, but not limited to, culture, religion, race and ethnicity. 7. Our AMA will create and support programs that introduce elementary through high school students, especially those from groups that are underrepresented in medicine (URM), to healthcare careers. 8. Our AMA will create and support pipeline programs and encourage support services for URM college stud ents that will support them as they move through college, medical school and residency programs. 9. Our AMA will recommend that medical school admissions committees and residency/fellowship programs use holistic assessments of applicants that take into account the diversity of preparation and the variety of talents that applicants bring to their education with the goal of improving health care for all communities. 10. Our AMA will advocate for the tracking and reporting to interested stakeholders of demogra phic information pertaining to URM status collected from Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) applications through the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP). 11. Our AMA will continue the research, advocacy, collaborative partnerships and ot her work that was initiated by the Commission to End Health Care Disparities. 12. Our AMA opposes legislation that would undermine institutions' ability to properly employ affirmative action to promote a diverse student population. 13. Our AMA will work wi th the AAMC and other stakeholders to create a question for the AAMC CME Rep. 02-A-23 -- page 22 of 24 electronic medical school application to identify previous pipeline program (also known as pathway program) participation and create a plan to analyze the data in order to determine the effectiveness of pipeline programs. Management and Leadership for Physicians, D -295.316 1. Our AMA will study advantages and disadvantages of various educational options on management and leadership for physicians with a report back to the House of Delegat es; and develop an online report and guide aimed at physicians interested in management and leadership that would include the advantages and disadvantages of various educational options. 2. Our AMA will work with key stakeholders to advocate for collaborative programs among medical schools, residency programs, and related schools of business and management to better prepare physicians for administrative, financial and leadership responsibilities in medical management. 3. Our AMA: (a) will advocate for and support the creation of leadership programs and curricula that emphasize experiential and active learning models to include knowledge, skills and management techniques integral to achieving personal and professional financial literacy and leading interprof essional team care, in the spirit of the AMA's Accelerating Change in Medical Education initiative; and (b) will advocate with the Liaison Committee for Medical Education, Association of American Medical Colleges and other governing bodies responsible for the education of future physicians to implement programs early in medical training to promote the development of leadership and personal and professional financial literacy capabilities. 4. Our AMA will: (a) study the extent of the impact of AMA Policy D -295.316, \"Management and Leadership for Physicians,\" on elective curriculum; and (b) expand efforts to promote the tenets of health systems science to prepare trainees for leadership roles and address prevalent challenges in the practice of medicine and pub lic health.

REPORT OF THE COUNCIL ON MEDICAL EDUCATION CME Report 03-A-23 Subject: Financial Burdens and Exam Fees for International Medical Graduates (Resolution 305 -A-22) Presented by: John P. Williams, MD, Chair Referred to: Reference Committee C At the 2022 Annual Meeting of the American Medical Association (AMA) House of Delegates 1 (HOD), Resolution 305 -A-22 was introduced by the Resident and Fellow Section. It asks : 2 3 That our American Medical Association work with all relevant stakeholders to reduce 4 application, exam, licensing fees and related financial burdens for international medical 5 graduates (IMGs) to ensure cost equity with U.S. MD and DO trainees (Directive to Take 6 Action); and be it further 7 8 That our AMA amend current policy H-255.966, \" Abolish Discrimination in Licensure of 9 IMGs,\" by addition to read as follows: 10 2. Our AMA will continue to work with the FSMB to encourage parity in licensure 11 requirements, and associated costs , for all physicians, whether U.S. medical school 12 graduates or international medical graduates. (Modify Current HOD Policy) 13 14 Testimony on this item noted concern for an unintended consequence that could stimulate debate 15 on the total costs of medical education, of which licensing fees constitute a small portion. The 16 Council on Medical Education offered substitute language for the first resolve, a sking the AMA to 17 study the most equitable approach to achieving parity between U.S. MD and DO trainees and 18 international medical graduates with regard to application, exam, and licensing fees and related 19 financial burdens; the Council also suggested that the second resolve not be adopted. The 20 Reference Committee supported study and encouraged the Council to consider the presence and 21 nature of varying application and examination costs for U.S. medical graduate and IMG applicants. 22 The HOD agreed, and this item was referred for study . 23 24 This report is a result of that referral . It aims to explain the steps an IMG must take to practice in 25 the U.S. and related financial burdens to obtaining the ability to practice in the U.S., compare these 26 IMG costs to that of non- IMG MD and DO trainees, and offer recommendations to address cost 27 disparities. 28 29 BACKGROUND 30 An international medical graduate (IMG) is defined as a \" physician who received a basic medical 31 degree from a medical school located outside the United States and Canada that is not accredited 32 by a U.S. accrediting body, the Liaison Committee on Medical Education, or the American 33 CME Rep. 03-A-23 -- page 2 of 15 Osteopathic Association .\"1 It is the location/accreditation of the medical school that determines if 1 the graduate is an IMG (as opposed to the citizenship of the physician). Thus, U.S. citizens who 2 graduated from medical schools outside the United States and Canada are considered IMGs, while 3 non-U.S. citizens who graduated from medical schools in the United States and Canada are not 4 considered IMGs. 5 6 A recent report from the Council on Medical Education, \" Expediting Entry of Qualified IMG 7 Physicians to U.S. Medical Practice \" (CME Report 4-J-21) states, \"IMGs currently represent a 8 quarter of the physician workforce and physicians- in-training in the United States. They have long 9 been an integral part of the U.S. health care system, contributing substantially to primary care 10 disciplines and providing care to underserved populations, and their foreign language proficiency 11 can be invaluable when communicating with patients from the same coun try of origin. The 12 diversity of IMGs contributes to the many ethnicities and cultures represented in the health care 13 workforce. This diversity is likely to be a factor enhancing health outcomes, considering the 14 equally diverse nature of the U.S. patient population.\"2 15 16 Further, this Council report indicates that compared with U.S. medical school graduates, IMGs 17 provide care to a disproportionate number of socioeconomically disadvantaged patients, and certain 18 states and specialties disproportionately depend on these physicians. These physicians play a 19 critical role in providing health care in areas of the country with higher rates of poverty and chronic 20 disease. Many IMGs have been practicing at institutions that are on the front line of the COVID-19 21 pandemic. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) offers a map of Medically 22 Underserved Areas/Populations (MUA/P). The Association of American Medical Colleges 23 (AAMC) State Physician Workforce Data Report provides related information. 24 25 While the intent of this report is to address application, exam, and licensing fees and related 26 financial burdens for IMGs as compared to U.S. medical school trainees, it is important to note that 27 U.S. trainees incur costs that IMGs may not. For example, the cost to maintain Liaison Committee 28 on Medical Education ( LCME ) or Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA) and 29 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME ) accreditation may be passed 30 onto U.S. trainees in their medical school tuition. This is a cost not borne by foreign medical 31 schools, although they may also have accreditation costs related to their own countries. 32 33 DISCUSSION 34 35 The pathway to medical licensure in the U.S. for all trainees involves many steps with specific 36 timelines and deadlines. For IMGs, it is even more complicated. Some IMGs have attended private 37 medical schools outside the U.S., while others have attended public medical schools, resulting in 38 varied costs. Further, there have been problems with credentialing and prima ry source verification 39 from some countries. The Council on Medical Education has authored a report for the Annual 2023 40 meeting addressing these challenges for IMGs resulting from international conflict that will 41 provide more detail on these issues. 42 43 Before addressing the cost differences between IMGs vs U.S. medical school graduates , it is 44 important to note that costs between MD and DO applicants to GME programs also vary. This 45 problem was recently addre ssed in an AMA issue brief entitled \"Single Pathway to Licensure.\" In 46 addition, there are further cost differences for IMGs. For example, the United States Medical 47 Licensing Examination\u00ae (USMLE\u00ae) Steps 1 and 2 cost IMGs $1,0003 per exam, versus $6604 for 48 MD students and $7155 for DO students. IMGs also pay international surcharges related to Steps 1 49 and 2 as well as application and certification fees from Educational Commission for Foreign 50 CME Rep. 03-A-23 -- page 3 of 15 Medical Graduates (ECFMG , a memb er of Intealth ). See Appendix A for a more detailed review of 1 this information. 2 3 The Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) provides a useful visual aid illuminating the 4 pathway to licensure for U.S. MD and DO students and IMGs; it also includes definitions of the 5 various related organizations, their acronyms, and links to their websites. In addition to these 6 required steps outlined in the FSMB guide, there are many associated costs , including exam 7 preparations and travel . When it comes to licensure, there is cost variance across states, 8 independent of U.S. medical graduate or IMG status. Additionally, there may be different threshold 9 qualifications for IMGs that could have their own costs6 along with additional steps for IMGs. For 10 example, Michigan requires IMGs seeking licensu re by endorsement to have an existing license 11 from another U.S. jurisdiction. North Carolina and New York require IMGs to have a profile set up 12 with the FSMB Federation Credentials Verification Service.7 13 14 Appendix A has further detail as to the costs of the steps necessary to pursue medical education and 15 training, as well as additional associated costs and how they vary among MD students, DO 16 students, and IMGs. Besides the steps described in this Appendix, non- U.S. citizen IMGs undergo 17 additional hurdles that U.S. citizen MD and DO students do not, such as visa applications for non- 18 citizens and tests of English language proficiency. 19 20 Visa process and barriers 21 22 Approximately 50 percent of IMGs in GME are U.S. citizens or permanent residents.8 The 23 remaining IMGs need to obtain a visa to enter the U.S. to train and/or practice medicine. This is 24 also true for the 0.6 percent of students in U.S. medical schools that are non- U.S. citizens.9 For 25 non-citizen medical school graduates, the following protocols must be accomplished: 26 The U.S. employer must obtain foreign labor certification from the U.S. Department of 27 Labor (DOL), prior to filing a petition with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services 28 (USCIS). 29 The USCIS must approve the petition or application (The required petition or application 30 depends on the visa category applied for). 31 The program approval must be entered in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information 32 System (SEVIS) of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). 33 34 Foreign physicians can work in the U.S. on four major types of visas : H-1B, J-1, O-1, and TN; the 35 J-1 Exchange Visitor program and the H-1B Temporary Worker classification are the most 36 common. The AMA's IMG toolkit provides additional information to understand the types of visas. 37 Once obtained, all visas need to be renewed for the duration of residency and fellowship training, 38 and each visa type has a different renewal schedule. 39 40 In addition to the challenges and costs of the visa application process , there have been recent 41 political changes and public health emergencies that have caused further delays and compounded 42 expenses. For example, on Jan 27, 2017, former President Donald J. Trump signed an executive 43 order, \" Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States ,\" that resulted in 44 travel bans impacting many IMGs and their ability to travel to the U.S. The AMA raised its 45 concerns to the Department of Homeland Security and others, given the detrimental impact on the 46 health care workforce and access to care. During his first day in office, President Biden issued a 47 proclamation on \"Ending Discriminatory Bans on Entry to The United States\" to revoke his 48 predecessor's Executive Order. Also, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted many IMGs by causing 49 additional delays in travel and the processing of documents that affected their ability to start their 50 residency, continue their training or practice, or transition from training to practice. On January 25, 51 CME Rep. 03-A-23 -- page 4 of 15 2021, President Biden issued a proclamation on \" the Suspension of Entry as I mmigrants and Non - 1 Immigrants of Certain Additional Persons Who Pose a Risk of Transmitting Coronavirus Disease.\" 2 The Council on Medical Education has been attentive to such issues, with related reports released 3 in 2010 and 2017, \"Rationalize Visa and Licen sure Process for IMG Residents\" ( CME 11-A-10) 4 and \"Impact of Immigration Barriers on the Nation 's Health \" (CME 3-I-17 ). 5 6 English language proficiency 7 8 Since the removal of the Clinical Skills exam component of the USMLE, IMGs are now required to 9 prove their ability to communicate effectively in English by passing the Occupational English Test 10 (OET). The OET is an English language test designed for health care professionals, owned by 11 Cambridge Assessment English and the Box Hill Institute. OET has been developed to cover 12 12 different health care professions, including medicine. The test assesses language skills in listening, 13 reading, writing, and speaking, utilizing typical communication scenarios from the health care 14 industry. OET is recognized by health care organizations, hospitals, universities, boards, and 15 councils across the world including the U.S. Passing the OET is a requirement for certification by 16 ECFMG for all IMGs, regardless of country of origin and currently costs $45510; see Appendix A. 17 18 Key stakeholders 19 20 The ECFMG provides IMGs with the process for certification before they enter U.S. GME. This 21 certification is a requirement for IMGs to take Step 3 of USMLE and to obtain an unrestricted 22 license to practice medicine in the U.S. ECFMG programs and web services assist IMGs with the 23 visa process, applying for GME, and verification services to obtain primary -source verification of 24 credentials. 25 The Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) supports the state and territorial medical boards in 26 the U.S. that license, discipline , and regulate physicians and other health care professionals. This 27 includes exam services related to USMLE Step 3 and the Spec ial Purpose Examination (SPEX\u00ae), 28 as well as credentialing and licensure services. According to the FSMB, SPEX is an examinationof 29 \"current knowledge requisite for the general, undifferentiated practice of medicine. State boards 30 may require SPEX for endorsement of licensure, reinstatement of a license, or reactivation of a 31 license after a period of inactivity .\"11 The FSMB has developed a useful table of state-by-state 32 information regarding licensure of IMGs , updated in August 2022. 33 34 American Medical Association 35 36 The AMA advocates at the federal and state levels to inform, guide, and generate support for 37 policies that advance initiatives address ing the concerns most relevant to all physicians. Examples 38 of current initiatives relevant to IMGs include supporting the Conrad 30 waiver program, 39 advocating to Congress about the importance of IMGs in the physician workforce, and vetting 40 legislation and monitoring regulations related to IMGs. At the 2023 AMA Advocacy Agenda 41 webinar in January, hosted by the Bo ard of Trustees, AMA staff leaders spoke to the importance of 42 advancing bills to support IMGs. 43 44 The AMA's International Medical Graduates Section (IMGS) advocates for issues that impact 45 IMGs, provides resources and assistance, and gives voice and representation to IMGs in the AMA 46 House of Delegates. Resources for IMGs from the section include t oolkits, FAQs, and a listing of 47 observership programs, as well as policy and advocacy opportunities. 48 In 2022, the Council on Medial Education published an issue brief , \"Support for IMGs practicing 49 in the US,\" which addresses potential alternative pathways for licensure for IMGs from select 50 countries including recognition of residency training outside the United States with completion of 51 CME Rep. 03-A-23 -- page 5 of 15 at least one year of graduate m edical education in an accredited U.S. program and unfettered travel 1 for IMGs for the duration of their legal stay in the U.S. in order to complete their residency or 2 fellowship training to prevent disruption of patient care. 3 4 RELEVANT AMA POLICIES 5 6 The AMA has a number of policies that demonstrate strong support for IMGs during and after 7 training, as well as for those who do not match , as provided in Appendix B. For example: 8 Policy H-255.988 , \"AMA Principles on International Medical Graduates, \" lists the AMA's 9 position on key IMG issues. 10 Policy H-255.966 , \"Abolish Discrimination in Licensure of IMGs, \" encourages the FSMB 11 and state medical boards to evaluate the progress of programs aimed at reducing barriers to 12 licensure\u2014including successes, failures, and barriers to implementation. 13 Policy D-310.977 , \"National Resident Matching Program Reform, \" encourages the 14 ECFMG and other interested stakeholders to study the personal and financial consequences 15 of ECFMG -certified U.S. IMGs who do not match. 16 17 SUMMARYAND RECOMMENDATIONS 18 19 IMGs face costly and time-consuming steps in their pursuit of U.S. medical training , licensure and 20 practice that are not required of their U.S. MD and DO counterparts. These costs can present 21 barriers and delays to their training and practice that impact IMGs, their training programs and 22 employers, and possibly the health of patients who rely on them for care. Key stakeholders, 23 including the AMA, recognize the additional challenges IMGs face and have been engaged in 24 assisting IMGs in meeting these challenges. The AMA continues to be engaged in such efforts. 25 26 The Council on Medical Education therefore recommends that the following recommendations be 27 adopted in lieu of Resolution 305-A-22, and the remainder of this report be filed: 28 29 1. That our Ame rican Medical Association (AMA) encourage key stakeholders, such as the 30 National Board of Medical Examiners, Federation of State Medical Boards, Educational 31 Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (a member of Intealth ), Cambridge 32 Assessment English and Box Hill Institute, and others to (a) study the most equitable 33 approach for achieving parity across U.S. MD and DO trainees and international medical 34 graduates with regard to application, exam, and licensing fees and relat ed financial 35 burdens; and (b) share this information with the medical education and IMG communities. 36 (Directive to Take Action) 37 38 2. That our AMA encourage relevant stakeholders to work together to achieve cost 39 equivalency for exams required of all medical students and trainees, including IMGs. 40 (Directive to Take Action) 41 42 3. That AMA policy H-255.988 , \"AMA Principles on International Medical Graduates,\" be 43 reaffirmed .

CME Rep. 03-A-23 -- page 10 of 15 APPENDIX B Relevant AMA Policy H-255.988, AMA Principles on International Medical Graduates Our AMA supports: 1. Current U.S. visa and immigration requirements applicable to foreign national physicians who are graduates of medical schools other than those in the United States and Canada. 2. Current regulations governing the issuance of exchange visitor visas to foreign national IMGs, including the requirements for successful completion of the USMLE. 3. The AMA reaffirms its policy that the U.S. and Canada medical schools be accredited by a nongovernmental accrediting body. 4. Cooperation in the collection and analysis of information on medical schools in nations other than the U.S. and Canada. 5. Continued cooperation with the ECFMG and other appropriate organizations to disseminate information to prospective and current students in foreign medical schools. An AMA member, who is an IMG, should be appointed regularly as one of the AMA's representatives to the ECFMG Board of Trustees. 6. Working with the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) to assure that institutions offering accredited residencies, residency program directors, and U.S. licensing authorities do not deviate from established standards when evaluating graduates of foreign medical schools. 7. In cooperation with the ACGME and the FSMB, supports only those modifications in established graduate medical education or licensing standards designed to enhance the quality of medical education and patient care. 8. The AMA continues to support the activities of the ECFMG related to verification of education credentials and testing of IMGs. 9. That special consideration be given to the limited number of IMGs who are refugees from foreign governments that refuse to provide pertinent information usually required to establish eligibility for residency training or licensure. 10. That accreditation standards enhance the quality of patient care and medical education and not be used for purposes of regulating physician manpower. 11. That AMA representatives to the ACGME, residency review committees and to the ECFMG should support AMA policy opposing discrimination. Medical school admissions officers and directors of residency programs should select applicants on the basis of merit, without considering status as an IMG or an ethnic name as a negative factor. 12. The requirement that all medical school graduates complete at least one year of graduate medical education in an accredited U.S. program in order to qualify for full and unrestricted licensure. State medical licensing boards are encouraged to allow an alternate set of criteria for granting licensure in lieu of this requirement: (a) completion of medical school and residency training outside the U.S.; (b) extensive U.S. medical practice; and (c) evidence of good standing within the local medical community. 13. Publicizing existing policy concerning the granting of staff and clinical privileges in hospitals and other health facilities. 14. The participation of all physicians, including graduates of foreign as well as U.S. and Canadian medical schools, in orga nized medicine. The AMA offers encouragement and assistance to state, county, and specialty medical societies in fostering greater membership among IMGs and their participation in leadership positions at all levels of organized medicine, including AMA committees and councils, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education and its review committees, the American Board of Medical Specialties and its specialty boards, and state boards of medicine, by providing guidelines and non- financial incentives, such as recognition for CME Rep. 03-A-23 -- page 11 of 15 outstanding achievements by either individuals or organizations in promoting leadership among IMGs. 15. Support studying the feasibility of conducting peer -to-peer membership recruitment efforts aimed at IMGs who are not AMA member s. 16. AMA membership outreach to IMGs, to include a) using its existing publications to highlight policies and activities of interest to IMGs, stressing the common concerns of all physicians; b) publicizing its many relevant resources to all physicians, especially to nonmember IMGs; c) identifying and publicizing AMA resources to respond to inquiries from IMGs; and d) expansion of its efforts to prepare and disseminate information about requirements for admission to accredited residency programs, the avail ability of positions, and the problems of becoming licensed and entering full and unrestricted medical practice in the U.S. that face IMGs. This information should be addressed to college students, high school and college advisors, and students in foreign medical schools. 17. Recognition of the common aims and goals of all physicians, particularly those practicing in the U.S., and support for including all physicians who are permanent residents of the U.S. in the mainstream of American medicine. 18. Its leadership role to promote the international exchange of medical knowledge as well as cultural understanding between the U.S. and other nations. 19. Institutions that sponsor exchange visitor programs in medical education, clinical medicine and public health to tailor programs for the individual visiting scholar that will meet the needs of the scholar, the institution, and the nation to which he will return. 20. Informing foreign national IMGs that the availability of training and practice opportunities in the U.S. is limited by the availability of fiscal and human resources to maintain the quality of medical education and patient care in the U.S., and that those IMGs who plan to return to their country of origin have the opportunity to obtain GME in the United States. 21. U.S. medical schools offering admission with advanced standing, within the capabilities determined by each institution, to international medical students who satisfy the requirements of the institution for matriculation. 22. The Federation of State Medical Boards, its member boards, and the ECFMG in their willingness to adjust their administrative procedures in processing IMG applications so that original documents do not have to be recertified in home countries when physicians apply for licens es in a second state. 23. Continued efforts to protect the rights and privileges of all physicians duly licensed in the U.S. regardless of ethnic or educational background and opposes any legislative efforts to discriminate against duly licensed physicians on the basis of ethnic or educational background. 24. Continued study of challenges and issues pertinent to IMGs as they affect our country' s health care system and our physician workforce. 25. Advocacy to Congress to fund studies through appropriate agen cies, such as the Department of Health and Human Services, to examine issues and experiences of IMGs and make recommendations for improvements. H-255.966, Abolish Discrimination in Licensure of IMGs 1. Our AMA supports the following principles related to medical licensure of international medical graduates (IMGs): A. State medical boards should ensure uniformity of licensure requirements for IMGs and graduates of U.S. and Canadian medical schools, including eliminating any disparity in the years of graduate medical education (GME) required for licensure and a uniform standard for the allowed number of administrations of licensure examinations. B. All physicians seeking licensure should be evaluated on the basis of their individual education, training, qualifications, skills, character, ethics, experience and past practice. CME Rep. 03-A-23 -- page 12 of 15 C. Discrimination against physi cians solely on the basis of national origin and/or the country in which they completed their medical education is inappropriate. D. U.S. states and territories retain the right and responsibility to determine the qualifications of individuals applying for licensure to practice medicine within their respective jurisdictions. E. State medical boards should be discouraged from a) using arbitrary and non- criteria -based lists of approved or unapproved foreign medical schools for licensure decisions and b) requi ring an interview or oral examination prior to licensure endorsement. More effective methods for evaluating the quality of IMGs' undergraduate medical education should be pursued with the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) and other relevant organiz ations. When available, the results should be a part of the determination of eligibility for licensure. 2. Our AMA will continue to work with the FSMB to encourage parity in licensure requirements for all physicians, whether U.S. medical school graduates or international medical graduates. 3. Our AMA will continue to work with the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates and other appropriate organizations in developing effective methods to evaluate the clinical skills of IMGs. 4. Our AMA will work with state medical societies in states with discriminatory licensure requirements between IMGs and graduates of U.S. and Canadian medical schools to advocate for parity in licensure requirements, using the AMA International Medical Graduate Section licensure parity model resolution as a resource. 5. Our AMA will: (a) encourage states to study existing strategies to improve policies and processes to assist IMGs with credentialing and licensure to enable them to care for patients in underserved areas; and (b) encourage the FSMB and state medical boards to evaluate the progress of programs aimed at reducing barriers to licensure--including successes, failures, and barriers to implementation. D-310.977, National Resident Matching Program Reform Our AMA: (1) will work with the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP) to develop and distribute educa tional programs to better inform applicants about the NRMP matching process, including the existing NRMP waiver and violations review policies; (2) will actively participate in the evaluation of, and provide timely comments about, all proposals to modify the NRMP Match; (3) will request that the NRMP explore the possibility of including the Osteopathic Match in the NRMP Match; (4) will continue to review the NRMP 's policies and procedures and make recommendations for improvements as the need arises, to include making the conditions of the Match agreement more transparent while assuring the confidentiality of the match; (5) will work with the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and other appropriate agencies to assure that the terms of employment for resident physicians are fair and equitable and reflect the unique and extensive amount of education and experience acquired by physicians; (6) does not support the current the \"All-In\" policy for the Main Residency Match to the extent that it eliminates flexibility within the match process; (7) will work with the NRMP, and other residency match programs, in revising Match policy, including the secondary match or scramble process to create more standardized rules for all candidates including application timelines and requirements; (8) will work with the NRMP and other external bodies to develop mechanisms that limit disparities within the residency application process and allow both flexibility and standard rules for applicants; (9) encourage s the National Resident Matching Program to study and publish the effects of implementation of the Supplemental Offer and Acceptance Program on the number of residency CME Rep. 03-A-23 -- page 13 of 15 spots not filled through the Main Residency Match and include stratified analysis by spe cialty and other relevant areas; (10) will work with the NRMP and ACGME to evaluate the challenges in moving from a time- based education framework toward a competency -based system, including: a) analysis of time- based implications of the ACGME milestones for residency programs; b) the impact on the NRMP and entry into residency programs if medical education programs offer variable time lengths based on acquisition of competencies; c) the impact on financial aid for medical students with variable time length s of medical education programs; d) the implications for interprofessional education and rewarding teamwork; and e) the implications for residents and students who achieve milestones earlier or later than their peers; (11) will work with the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), American Osteopathic Association (AOA), American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (AACOM), and National Resident Matching Program (NRMP) to evaluate the current available data or propose new studies that would help us learn how many students graduating from US medical schools each year do not enter into a US residency program; how many never enter into a US residency program; whether there is disproportionate impact on individuals of minority racial and ethn ic groups; and what careers are pursued by those with an MD or DO degree who do not enter residency programs; (12) will work with the AAMC, AOA, AACOM and appropriate licensing boards to study whether US medical school graduates and international medical graduates who do not enter residency programs may be able to serve unmet national health care needs; (13) will work with the AAMC, AOA, AACOM and the NRMP to evaluate the feasibility of a national tracking system for US medical students who do not initially match into a categorical residency program; (14) will discuss with the National Resident Matching Program, Association of American Medical Colleges, American Osteopathic Association, Liaison Committee on Medical Education, Accreditation Council for Gradua te Medical Education, and other interested bodies potential pathways for reengagement in medicine following an unsuccessful match and report back on the results of those discussions; (15) encourages the Association of American Medical Colleges to work with U.S. medical schools to identify best practices, including career counseling, used by medical schools to facilitate successful matches for medical school seniors, and reduce the number who do not match; (16) supports the movement toward a unified and standardized residency application and match system for all non-military residencies; (17) encourages the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG) and other interested stakeholders to study the personal and financial consequences of ECFMG -certified U.S. IMGs who do not match in the National Resident Matching Program and are therefore unable to get a residency or practice medicine; (18) en courages the AAMC, AACOM, NRMP, and other key stakeholders to jointly create a no- fee, easily accessible clearinghouse of reliable and valid advice and tools for residency program applic ants seeking cost-effective methods for applying to and successfully matching into residency; and (19) will work with appropriate stakeholders to study options for improving transparency in the resident application process.

REPORT 04 OF THE COUNCIL ON MEDICAL EDUCATION (A -23) Decreasing Bias in Assessments of Medical Student Clinical Clerkship Performance (Resolution 309- A-22, Resolve 2) (Reference Committee C) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Per a directive from the House of Delegates (HOD) , the American Medical Association ( AMA ) has been asked to study and report back on the impact of two -interval clinical clerkship grading systems on residency application outcomes, clinical performance during residency , and bias . This report defines two -interval grading (binary pass/fail with no other hierarchical ranking) and notes existing policy regarding pass/fail in non -clinical curricul a. This report offers the theoretical background for the importance of pass/fail grading within competency -based medical education and formative assessment . It also highlights the competitive medical education system and the ongoing demand for summative assessment and ranking, particularly due to applicant selection challenges impacting both learners and program directors. Due to a need for additional future research combining the multiple factors indicated by the HOD's directive , this report instead summarizes research on each relevant topic individually, including significant variability and bias within clinical clerkship grading ; existing recommendations toward improving reliability in this area ; background on how grading system data is collected ; proportions of two -interval pass/fail grading systems across medical schools; and current overall research on residency application outcomes, longitudinal performance tracking, and bias issues. This report emphasizes the diverse factors and potential unintended consequences that may arise when hierarchy is eliminated in one area of medical education and ranking decisions are shifted to other areas. This report proposes reaffirmation of current AMA policy and offers new recommendations that continue to encourage work in support of the Coalition for Physician Accountability's Undergraduate Medical Education -Graduate Medical Education Review Committee \"Recommendations for Comprehensive Improvement of the UME -GME Transition\"; encourage and support UME institutions' investment in a) developing more valid, reliable, and unbiased summative assessments for clinical clerkships, includin g development of assessors' awareness regarding structural inequities in education and wider society, and b) providing standardized and meaningful competency data to program directors; encourage institutions to publish information related to clinical clerk ship grading systems and residency m atch rates, with subset data for learners from varied groups, including those that have been historically underrepresented in medicine or may be affected by bias ; and encourage UME institutions to include grading system methodology with grades shared with residency programs.\u00a9 2023 American Medical Association. All rights r eserved . REPORT OF THE COUNCIL ON MEDICAL EDUCATION CME Report 04-A-23 Subject: Decreasing Bias in Assessments of Medical Student Clinical Clerkship Performance (Resolution 309-A-22, Resolve 2 ) Presented by: John P. Williams , MD, Chair Referred to: Reference Committee C Resolution 309-A-22, \" Decreasing Bias in Evaluations of Medical Student Performance,\" was 1 introduced by the Medical Student Section at the 2022 Annual Meeting of the American Medical 2 Association (AMA). While Resolve 1 was adopted into AMA Policy D-295.307 , Resolve 2 was 3 referred for study. The referred clause asked that our AMA: 4 5 Study the impact of two -interval clinical clerkship grading systems on residency application 6 outcomes and clinical performance during residency . 7 8 Testimony emphasized the current difficulty in accessing data needed to inform such a study and 9 work underway via the AMA ChangeMedEd initiative toward longitudinal tracking. Testimony 10 also highlighted challenges faced by program directors , the delicate balance of wanting more data 11 versus ensuring unbiased data, and equity concern s regarding current grading models and diverse 12 learners . Reference Committee C and the House of Delegates (HOD) felt that these concerns 13 warranted further study. This r eport is in response to this referral . 14 15 BACKGROUND 16 17 Clinical Clerkships and Two-Interval Grading 18 19 In clinical clerkships, medical students are immersed in learning experiences involving direct 20 patient care and application of clinical sciences. 1 This comprises both core and elective rotations, 21 beginning in the third year of medical school, and with significant variability between clerkship 22 experiences based on seasonal infectious disease cycles, electives chosen, and other considerations. 23 24 Two-interval grading refers to grading structures with only two options, either pass or fail , though 25 these grades may also be accompanied by narrative information . Two -interval pass/fail grading is 26 distinct from generalized pass/fail grading insofar as som e pass/fail grading structures offer 27 opportunities for grading with honors and other hierarchies, such as \"high pass,\" as opposed to the 28 binary pass/fail. While AMA Policy H-295.866 , \"Supporting Two- Interval Grading Systems for 29 Medical Education,\" encourages \" the establishment of a two -interval grading system in medical 30 colleges and universities in the United Stat es for the non -clinical curriculum,\" current policy does 31 not address clinical curriculum. 32 33 Competency- Based Medical Education and the \"Growth Mindset\" 34 35 The c urrent rationale for two -interval grading centers around learner trust and growth within the 36 move toward competency- based medical education , or CBME (see also AMA policy D-295.317 ). 37 CME Rep ort 04-A-23 -- page 3 of 19 Specifically, for medical education to focus on outcomes via a developmental approach, 1 vulnerability for learners must be acknowledged and institutional culture must demonstrate 2 trustworthiness, as learner gaps and needs may only be addressed if acknowledged rather than 3 hidden due to performance pressure .2 Thus , two-interval pass/fail frees the learner from striving for 4 a specific performative grade, allowing more transparency around gaps . This redirects focus to 5 effectively meeting required competencies (passing) after careful consideration of areas for 6 improvement, rather than concealing difficulties to rank higher. Equity between learners is 7 complex and not inherently achieved by grading system changes alone, as discussed in later 8 sections. B iases related to race, gender , disability, or other factors exist in a wider societal 9 structure , and interventions require a multi -pronged approach.3 However, even highly rigorous and 10 non-biased assessments would drive undesired behaviors (concealment versus transparency toward 11 growt h) if graded or ranked.4 Nonetheless , larger medical education and societal structures 12 currently create a demand for ranking, as discussed below. 13 14 Applicant Selection Challenges 15 16 A significant concern regarding possible elimina tion of tiered rankings in c lerkship grades involves 17 the increasing number of residency applications and growing challenges for programs when 18 selecting from an overwhelming number of candidates . The United States Medical Licensing 19 Examination\u00ae (USMLE\u00ae) Step 1 examination 's shift to pass/fail in January 2022 sparked concerns 20 in this regard from residency program directors : a study of internal medicine program directors 21 found that, in the absence of graded Step 1 examination scores, program personnel would be 22 increasingly lik ely to weight such variables as ranked clerkship grades , Step 2 exam scores , 23 personal knowledge of the applicant, and audition electives ; respondents also expressed the belief 24 that osteopathic applicants may potentially be further disadvantaged.5 Data reg arding actual impact 25 is unknown because not enough time has passed. Without an overhaul of the application process 26 and infrastructure supportive of the time necessary for holistic review of applicants6 or transition 27 away from competition -based processes (i.e., randomization via lottery) , eliminating rankings in 28 certain areas may indeed pose challenges. However, clerkship grades are an unreliable measure for 29 evaluating residency applicants and challenged by inconsistencies and bias , as further described in 30 the next section . 31 32 Unreliability and Variability in Clinical Clerkship Grades 33 34 Despite perceptions of their importance in selecting program applicant s, clinical clerkship grades 35 are generally found to be inconsistent and unreliable.7 In one study, most students believed that 36 clerkship grades were unfair and that being liked by specific supervisors most influenced grading8; 37 further data confirms the detachment of clerkship grades from useful assessment criteria. One study 38 noted that most medical sch ools used a four -tier system of fail, pass, high pass, or honors, but all 39 define d these words subjectively and inconsistently , even within the same programs ; this variabilit y 40 across schools and even within programs pose s a challenge to accurate stratificat ion of applicants .9 41 U.S. News & World Report Top 20 medical schools were also more likely to disproportionately 42 assign the highest clerkship grade to a higher percentage of students than other medical schools ,10 43 even though these schools were also less likely to implement grade comparison at all.11 Clerkship 44 grades often suggest the \"illusion of objectivity,\" despite no standard approach to assigning grades 45 or rank, flawed data not based on actual observations, high stress for stu dents, and time -based 46 grading paradigms that promote inequities.12 47 48 Equity and Diversity Concerns Within Medical School Assessment 49 50 CME Rep ort 04-A-23 -- page 4 of 19 Beyond concerns of general unreliability, equity and diversity concerns also arise within clinical 1 clerkship assessment . One 2018 study (which defined \"underrepresented in medicine\" narrowly as 2 students from the racial or ethnic groups Black, Latin a/o/x, Native American , and Alaska Native ) 3 demonstrated differences in clerkship director ratings that consistently favored non - 4 underrepresented students, and while these differences were small, they created an amplification 5 cascade later in the educational experience, compounding challeng es already faced by these 6 students due to structural racism .13 Another 2019 study demonstrated that, even after accounting 7 for confounding variables, grades were more likely to favor white students above both 8 underrepresented and non- underrepresented students of color.14 Even prior to grading itself, the 9 training environment and overall social environment already hind ers students from marginalized 10 racial/ethnic groups, depleting cognitive resources and interfering with learning,15 such that even 11 with more \"objective\" grading standards, societal bias already creates an inequitable environment 12 for learning . Final ly, while research that addresses the specific topic of clinical clerkship 13 assessment for other marginalized identities/experiences is limited , learners are subject ed to 14 systemic biases i n many realms, such as LGBTQ issues,16 socioeconomic status17, and di sability .18 15 16 DISCUSSION 17 18 Course grades perform two purported functions: giving students a summative evaluation of their 19 course performance and providing a standardized means of communicating student performance to 20 third parties. Grades should be distinguished from formative assessments, which are focused on 21 improving student learning. As a summative evaluation, grades should be based on valid and 22 reliable data and contain suf ficient information to be useful to students and third parties , with 23 attention to the ways larger systemic bias and inequitable assignment of merit influences even 24 otherwise reliable data .19 Current data demonstrated above indicates significant reliability concerns 25 in current grading systems. 26 27 Little data exists to demonstrate the impact of two -interval clinical clerkship grading on residency 28 application outcomes and clinical performance during residency, and even less data that includes 29 analysis by race, g ender, socioeconomic class, disability, or other relevant demographics . This 30 report seek s to split the question into its various components, provide background on how some 31 data is collected and reported, offer currently available research, and offer sugges tions on how this 32 data might be gathered in the future. 33 34 Current Data and Challenges Regarding Pass/Fail in Clinical Clerkships 35 36 Much current research suggests that two -interval pass/fail grading systems improve learner well- 37 being in the preclinical years,20 and academic performance remains similar, with an increased 38 opportunity for a reduction of stress and less competitive learning environment.21 Proponents of 39 CBME also generally advocate to reframe -interval pass/fail as two-interval \"only pass/not yet 40 and to utilize criterion -referenced assessment such that learners will pass in time.22 Support 41 for CBME is inherently linked to removing hierarchical grading structures in all aspects of medical 42 education.23 43 44 Data around usage of pass/fail grading systems in clinical clerkships is collected by the Liaison 45 Committee on Medical Education (LCME) for allopathic schools and by the American Association 46 of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (AACOM) for osteopathic schools , but few analyses of 47 impact exist . 48 49 The LCME's files indicated the follow ing data for each portion of the curriculum: 50 CME Rep ort 04-A-23 -- page 5 of 19 LCME Part II Totals: Type of Grading System Used ( 2019 -2020 ) Grading system Required clerkships Fourth -year selectives/sub - internships Electives Pass -fail 11 32 84 Honors -pass-fail 26 27 21 Honors -high pass - pass-fail 85 68 57 Numerical grade 6 1 0 Letter grade 24 19 10 Other 13 8 7 LCME Part II Totals: Type of Grading System Used (20 20-2021) Grading system Required clinical clerkships Fourth -year selectives/sub - internships Electives Pass -fail 24 37 92 Honors -pass-fail 25 27 22 Honors -high pass - pass-fail 81 72 54 Numerical grade 7 4 7 Letter grade 20 18 9 Other 11 10 12 LCME Part II Totals: Type of Grading System Used (202 1-2022) Grading system Required clinical clerkships Fourth -year selectives/sub - internships Electives Pass -fail 20 37 90 Honors -pass-fail 26 27 18 Honors -high pass - pass-fail 82 73 55 Numerical grade 3 0 0 Letter grade 19 15 10 Other 9 8 10 As seen above, within required clinical clerkships, two- interval pass /fail accounted for only about 1 seven percent of grading systems in 2019- 2020 and 14 percent in 2020- 2021, with a slight decline 2 in 2021- 2022 to 20 schools out of 155, or about 13 percent . In fourth- year medical selective 3 rotations, two- interval pass/ fail grading systems accounted for about 21 percent in 2019- 2020, 22 4 percent in 2020- 2021, and 23 percent in 2021- 2022. Elective clerkships were m ore likely to be 5 two-interval pass /fail than other clerkships, as this accounted for about 47 percent of grading 6 systems in both 2019- 2020 and 2020- 2021 , and about 49 percent in 2021- 2022. 7 8 The most recent AACOM data available showed that 28 schools used p ass/fail to grade required 9 clinical clerkships , while 21 schools used pass /fail for elective/selective grading .24 However, this 10 data reflects multi -interval pass/fail variants including honors and does not indicate which, if any, 11 use two-interval grading. Looking closer, a 2020 study of transcripts indicated that osteopathic 12 medical schools' grading system distribution in clinical years was 59.5 percent honors, 29.7 13 percent letter grade, and 10.8 percent other systems. Only one of the 37 osteopathic medical 14 CME Rep ort 04-A-23 -- page 6 of 19 schools participating in this study used two- interval pass /fail systems without tiered indicators such 1 as \"high pass\" in the clinical years.25 This study demonstrated the variability between grading 2 systems, both within and between allopathic and osteopathic schools, and the rarity of two- interval 3 pass/fail in clerkship years. 4 5 Given limited implementation of two -interval pass/fail, research on the impact of this grading 6 mechanism is even more limited. In 2021, faculty from one institution responded to the elimination 7 of tiered clerkship grades with optimism for well- being and the learning environment, as well as 8 hesitations, such as lack of readiness for hierarchies in later educational structures and concerns 9 about the residency selection process.26 Students in a different 2021 qualitative study shared that 10 implementation of two-interval pass/fail core clerkship grading , in combination with enha nced 11 formative feedback, resulted in benefits to intrinsic motivation, increased ability to seek feedback 12 and improvements, lowered stress, and perceived mitigation of equity concerns .27 However, this 13 perceived mitigation was not confirmed with outcomes -based data , nor are these perceptions 14 disaggregated by respondent demographics . In another study from 2022, transitioning to two- 15 interval clinical clerkship grades with enhanced feedback was related to moderate to large 16 improvements in students' perceptions of grading and the learning environment, toward that of 17 \"mastery -oriented learning\" rather than performative behavior. Simultaneously, deeper learner 18 concerns around bias in evaluators and inequitable narrative summaries remained .28 19 20 Current Clinical Clerkship Recommendations for Eliminating Grading Bias 21 22 Grappling with known equity issues, the Alliance for Academic Internal Medicine's 2021 report, 23 \"Aiming for Equity in Clerkship Grading: Recommendations for Reducing the Effects of Structural 24 and Individual Bias\" indicated the scarcity of evidence -based resources for eliminating bias in 25 clinical clerkship grading. U sing a socioecological model , the authors suggest several possible 26 interventions for further implementation and study , including bu t not limited to faculty 27 development, non- normative competency- based grading, and refraining from standardized cut -off 28 scores to designate honors in grading, though recommendations do not explicitly suggest removal 29 of honors within grading.29 30 31 Also r egardi ng systemic bias concerns in grading, the Coalition for Physician Accountability's 32 Undergraduate Medical Education -Graduate Medical Education Review Committee recommended 33 the following in 2021: \"To eliminate systemic biases in grading, medical schools must perform 34 initial and annual exploratory reviews of clinical clerkship grading, including patterns of grade 35 distribution based on race, ethnicity, gender identity/expression, sexual identity/orientation, 36 religion, visa status, ability, and location (e.g., s atellite or clinical site location), and perform 37 regular faculty development to mitigate bias. Programs across the UME -GME continuum should 38 explore the impact of bias on student and resident evaluations, match results, attrition, and selection 39 to honor soc ieties .\"30 40 41 In 2022, Russo et al. demonstrated the bias present within clinical clerkship grades and suggested 42 that two -interval pass/fail grading as one component may mitigate the impact of bias, though it will 43 not eliminate bias itself . \"Shifting to a c ompetence -based assessment model will give the learner 44 multiple opportunities over time to demonstrate their mastery of skills and knowledge, thereby 45 reducing the power of a single biased assessment.\"31 46 47 Due to the complexities of bias within clinical clerkship grading systems, the need for innovation is 48 clear , but additional evidence is required to understand whether two-interval pass/fail grading 49 effectively addresses these challenges. 50 51 CME Rep ort 04-A-23 -- page 7 of 19 Current Data and Challenges Regarding Pass/Fail and Residency Application Outcomes 1 2 When considering how to understand the impact two- interval pass/fail in clinical clerkships may 3 have on residency application outcomes, especially regarding bias and equity, one must first 4 consider what data is needed, and how this data is currently collected. 5 6 Match results from applications to residency programs are reported in aggregate by both the 7 National Resident Matching Program (NRMP ) and by medical schools. While it might be possible 8 to determine some correlation between the schools that use two -interval pass/fail in clinical 9 clerkships and their aggregate Match results, all other confounding factors would need to be 10 considered, including other aspects of the school and all other d etermining factors considered in 11 applications, both on larger -scale and individual learner levels. When also considering learner 12 diversity and any potential impacts of bias, information would need to be disaggregated into 13 multiple categories, such as race, ethnicity, disability, gender identity, sexual orientation, 14 socioeconomic status, and more. Some of this information is currently collected in aggregate ways, 15 such as through the Association of American Medical Colleges ' (AAMC ) Medical School 16 Graduation Q uestionnaire,32 but not all aspects of bias are addressed ; these results are not tied to 17 specific application outcomes or individuals due to privacy concerns. Further insights on two- 18 interval pass/fail grading systems' impact on bias in residency applicati on outcomes would require 19 the limited number of schools with two- interval pass/fail in clinical clerkship to study this 20 specifically, comparing archival data before two -interval grading with current data, and with a 21 student population large enough to ensur e confidentiality for participant s. This data would then 22 need to be published. Multiple schools would need to achieve this to provide sufficient numbers to 23 allow for compar ison between institutions , and between allopathic versus osteopathic programs . 24 25 Outside of medical schools, in a related field, a 2019 study found that for Doctor of Pharmacy 26 students within advanced pharmacy practice experiences, there was little statistical difference in 27 residency match rates between applicants with two-interval pas s/fail grades and tiered grades to 28 assess clinical experiences. However, pharmacy education exists in a different context than medical 29 education, and extrapolations cannot necessarily be made. 30 31 As discussed in earlier sections, it is well -known that bias i s a concern in residency application 32 outcomes. A 2019 study found no statistically significant differences in residency application 33 outcomes in one institution when pre -clinical grades are pass/fail ,33 but no such research currently 34 exists for clinical cle rkships. Current research merely indicates that clinical clerkship grades overall 35 are not useful for ranking residency applications .34 A 2021 study suggested that receiving honors in 36 clinical clerkship grading contributed to matching into the applicant's t op five programs in 37 OB/GYN35 where honors were available, but that minority and male students were less likely to 38 receive honors, suggesting further need for research into grading disparities. 39 40 Residency programs must currently create a rank list of applic ants for admission , and in numerous 41 specialties and for many residency programs, the number of qualified applicants to be evaluated 42 greatly exceeds the number of positions ava ilable . Medical school clerkship grades are among 43 several factors used by residen cy programs to determine the ranking of applicants. Though these 44 grades are currently unreliable, as discussed above, conversion to two-interval pass/fail grading 45 system s for clerkships without other interventions will require residency programs to weigh other 46 data points more heavily when reviewing applications , such a s recommendation letters or perceived 47 medical school reputation. It is uncertain if these alternative factors are more valid or subject to less 48 bias than clerksh ip grades , and the impacts on diverse student groups are still uncertain. While 49 further knowledge is gathered, medical schools can invest in improving their grading systems to 50 CME Rep ort 04-A-23 -- page 8 of 19 decrease bias, provide transparency to residency programs regarding their grading system 1 methodologies, and invest in methods of providing more useful information to residency programs. 2 3 Current Data and Challeng es Regarding Longitudinal Tracking into Residency 4 5 Additional challenges arise when seeking data on how two- interval pass/fail grades in clinical 6 clerkship and bias may impact residency performance outcomes. For longitudinal tracking into 7 residency, current data sources include feedback from program directors to school deans, either 8 sent by the school or coordinated by the AAMC Resident Readiness Survey. 36 However, 9 information published by the AAMC does not track comparatively across schools, and even 10 comparative school data would need to account for confounding factors, not merely each school' s 11 clinical clerkship grading system . As with application outcome challenges, residency performance 12 outcome challenges also include the need to collect and disaggregate demographic information for 13 learners without violating learner privacy. 14 15 There is currently no pre -existing research to dr aw from on the direct impact of two -interval 16 pass/fail clinical clerkship grading systems on residency performance outcomes, with or without 17 the consideration of equity and bias. One 2019 study that begins to approach the topic is a meta- 18 analysis of progra m directors' perceptions of residency performance among residents from schools 19 using two- interval pass/fail versus tiered clerkship grading , which found no significant difference 20 in perceptions of overall performance between these groups. 37 However, perceptions of 21 performance do not inherently translate to actual actions taken nor actual criterion -referenced 22 performance and carry the additional limitation of reflecting only on those who were already 23 admitted into residency. 24 25 Some progress has been made on overall development of longitudinal tracking, though not related 26 to these topics specifically. For instance, the AMA Accelerating Change in Medical Education 27 Consortium created a personalized graduate p rofile for 32 medical s chools, addressing three core 28 questions of workforce, clinical exposure, and quality of care. This may serve as \" a proof of 29 concept \" for further research into the topics of this report. 38 The Accreditation Council for 30 Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) als o collects milestone data by specialty,39 but this data is 31 not currently compared with data on pass/fail grading systems in clinical clerkships. There is also 32 evidence to suggest that racial and ethnic biases may impact milestone levels . For instance, a 2022 33 study in pediatric programs found race and gender disparities in assessments of trainees in 34 residency programs.40 35 36 RELEVANT AMA POLICY 37 38 The AMA has extensive policy related to grading systems and mitigating bias in medical 39 education. Some examples are as follows: 40 41 D-200.985 , \"Strategies for Enhancing Diversity in the Physician Workforce,\" recommend s 42 that residency/fellowship programs use holistic assessments of applicants that take into 43 account the diversity of preparation and the variety of talents that applicants bring to their 44 education. 45 D-310.945 , \"Mitigating Demographic and Socioeconomic Inequities in the Residency and 46 Fellowship Selection Process,\" encourages medical schools, medical honor societies, and 47 residency/fellowship programs to work toward ethical, equitable, and transparent recruiting 48 processes, which are made available to all applicants. 49 CME Rep ort 04-A-23 -- page 9 of 19 D-295.988 , \"Clinical Skills Assessment During Medical School ,\" work s with appropriate 1 stakeholders to assure the processes for assessing clinical skills are evidence-based and 2 most efficiently use the time and financial resources of those being assessed . 3 D-295.317 , \"Competency Based Medical Education Across the Continuum of Education 4 and Practice,\" continues to stu dy and identify challenges and opportunities and critical 5 stakeholders in achieving a competency -based curriculum across the medical education 6 continuum and other health professions that provides significant value to those 7 participating in these curricula and their patients. 8 D-295.318 , \"Competency- Based Portfolio Assessment of Medical Students, \" develops 9 pilot projects to study the impact of competency-based frameworks on student graduation, 10 the residency match process, and off- cycle entry into residency programs . 11 D-295.963 , \"Continued Support for Diversity in Medical Education,\" work s with 12 appropriate stakeholders to commission and enact the recommendations of a forward- 13 looking, cross-continuum, external study of 21st century medical education focused on 14 reimagining the future of health equity and racial justice in medical education. 15 D-295.307 , \"Decreasing Bias in Evaluations of Medical Student Performance,\" work s with 16 appropriate stakeholders to promote efforts to evaluate methods for decreasing the impact 17 of bias in medical student performance evaluation as well as reducing the impact of bias in 18 the review of disciplinary actions. 19 D-295.983 , \"Fostering Professionalism During Medical School and Residency Training,\" 20 continues to study the clinical trainin g environment to identify the best methods and 21 practices used by medical schools and residency programs to foster the development of 22 professionalism. 23 H-350.979 , \"Increase the Representation of Minority and Economically Disadvantaged 24 Populations in the Medical Profession,\" supports increasing the representation of 25 minorities in the physician popul ation . 26 D-295.322 , \"Increasing Demographically Diverse Representation in Liaison Committee on 27 Medical Education Accredited Medical Schools ,\" stud ies medical school implementation 28 of the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) Standard IS-16 and share the 29 results with appropriate accreditation organizations and all state medical associations for 30 action on demographic diversity. 31 H-295.866 , \"Supporting Two- Interval Grading Systems for Medical Education ,\" work s 32 with stakeholders to encourage the establishment of a two -interval grading system in 33 medical colleges and universities in the United States for the non -clinical curricu lum. 34 35 These policies are listed in full detail in Appendix A. 36 37 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS 38 39 Fair and equitable assessment in medical school improves career opportunities for medical students 40 and benefits the public which deserves a more diverse physician w orkforce. Grades are one form of 41 summative assessment of student performance , and summative assessment should provide third 42 parties with important information about learner competencies and readiness . Current research 43 demonstrates that despite the weightin g of clinical clerkship grades in residency applicant 44 selection, these grades are currently inconsistent , unreliable , and biased. Thus, medical schools 45 should invest in developing valid, reliable, unbiased, and informative assessments for clerkships. 46 Two-interval pass/fail clinical clerkship grading systems are rare in allopathic and osteopathic 47 schools alike, and understanding their impacts on residency application outcomes and clinical 48 performance during residency, especially from an equity lens, will require significant effort by 49 researchers and medical education stakeholders. Efforts toward longitudinal tracking in general are 50 CME Rep ort 04-A-23 -- page 10 of 19 also still in the early stages. However, both AMA policy and pre- existing research do support 1 overall well -being and learning environment improvements related to two- interval pass/fail grading 2 systems in the pre-clinical years. Not all schools have implemented this grading structure, and 3 continued encouragement to do so is warranted. 4 5 Learners, including learners experiencing systemic oppression in one or many domains , are not a 6 monolith, and the need for nuance is paramount as these issues are addressed. Inequity in clinical 7 clerkship assessment may be one symptom of the wider culture of systemic bias as well as a 8 reflection of the current learning environment of competition within medical education. The 9 \"bottleneck\" within the popularity of certain specialties over others also amplifies the competitive 10 environment. Without a greater shift within medical education's values, or wi thout tending to the 11 entire landscape of medical education, modifying one component piece may send varying intended 12 and unintended ripple effects outwards to the other components of learner assessment \u2014potentially 13 shifting pressure and bias from one area to another, and having unknown and heterogeneous effects 14 on a variety of learners. It is difficult to assess only one piece of the overall system to reflect an 15 understanding of overall equity in assessment , and even more challenging to correct only one piece 16 of a much wider puzzle. Despite these challenges, further gathering of data and the exploration of 17 innovations across the continuum of medical education is beneficial, with an emphasis on attention 18 to the needs of unique populations, especially those that are underrepresented in medicine or 19 experience bias. An evidence base for best practices and interventions can and should be gathered . 20 Strategies must focus on the wider whole, including evaluating the benefits and challenges of 21 moving to a competency- based system with equity at the forefront, rather than a time-based and 22 competitive system. 23 24 The Council on Medical Education therefore recommends that the following recommendations be 25 adopted in lieu of Resolution 309-A-22, Resolve 2, and the remainder of this report be filed: 26 27 That our American Medical Association ( AMA): 28 29 1. Continue to encourage work in support of the Coalition for Physician Accountability's 30 Undergraduate Medical Education -Graduate Medical Education Review Committee 31 \"Recommendations for Comprehensive Improvement of the UME- GME Transition .\" 32 (Directive to Take Action) 33 34 2. Encourage and support UME institutions' investment in a) developing more valid, reliable, 35 and unbiased summative assessments for clinical clerkships , including development of 36 assessors' awareness regarding structural inequities in education and wider society, and b) 37 providing standardized and meaningful competen cy data to program directors . (New HOD 38 Policy) 39 40 3. Encourage institutions to publish information related to clinical clerkship grading systems 41 and residency m atch rates, with subset data for learners from varied groups, including 42 those that have been historically underrepresented in medicine or may be affected by bias. 43 (New HOD Policy) 44 45 4. Encourage UME institutions to include grading system methodology with grades shared 46 with residency programs. (New HOD Policy) 47 48 5. Reaffirm the following policies: 49 50 D-295.307 , \"Decreasing Bias in Evaluations of Medical Student Performance\" 51 CME Rep ort 04-A-23 -- page 11 of 19 H-295.866 , \"Supporting Two- Grading Systems for Medical Education\" D-295.317 , \"Competency Based Medical Education Across the of Education 2 and Practice\" 3 D-295.318 , \"Competency- Based Portfolio Assessment of Medical Students\" 4 5 6 Fiscal note: TBD 7 8 APPENDIX A: RELEVANT AMA POLICY 9 10 Strategies for Enhancing Diversity in the Physician Workforce D-200.985 11 1. Our AMA, independently and in collaboration with other groups such as the Association of 12 American Medical Colleges (AAMC), will actively work and advocate for funding at the federal 13 and state levels and in the private sector to support the following: (a) Pipeline programs to prepare 14 and motivate members of underrepresented groups to enter medical school; (b) Diversity or 15 minority affairs offices at medical schools; (c) Financial aid programs for students from groups that 16 are underrepresented in medicine; and (d) Financial support programs to recruit and develop 17 faculty members from underrepresented groups. 18 2. Our AMA will work to obtain full restoration and protection of federal Title VII funding, and 19 similar state funding programs, for the Centers of Excellence Program, Health Careers Opportunity 20 Program, Area Health Education Centers, and other programs that support physician training, 21 recruitment, and retention in geographically- underserved areas. 22 3. Our AMA will take a leadership role in efforts to enhance diversity in the physician workforce, 23 including engaging in broad-based efforts that involve partners within and beyond the medical 24 profession and medical education community. 25 4. Our AMA will encourage the Liaison Committee on Medical Education to assure that medical 26 schools demonstrate compliance with its requirements for a diverse student body and facu lty. 27 5. Our AMA will develop an internal education program for its members on the issues and 28 possibilities involved in creating a diverse physician population. 29 6. Our AMA will provide on- line educational materials for its membership that address diversity 30 issues in patient care including, but not limited to, culture, religion, race and ethnicity. 31 7. Our AMA will create and support programs that introduce elementary through high school 32 students, especially those from groups that are underrepresented in medic ine (URM), to healthcare 33 careers. 34 8. Our AMA will create and support pipeline programs and encourage support services for URM 35 college students that will support them as they move through college, medical school and residency 36 programs. 37 9. Our AMA will recommend that medical school admissions committees and residency/fellowship 38 programs use holistic assessments of applicants that take into account the diversity of preparation 39 and the variety of talents that applicants bring to their education with the goal of improving health 40 care for all communities. 41 10. Our AMA will advocate for the tracking and reporting to interested stakeholders of 42 demographic information pertaining to URM status collected from Electronic Residency 43 Application Service (ERAS) applications through the National Resident Matching Program 44 (NRMP). 45 11. Our AMA will continue the research, advocacy, collaborative partnerships and other work that 46 was initiated by the Commission to End Health Care Disparities. 47 12. Our AMA opposes legislation that would undermine institutions' ability to properly employ 48 affirmative action to promote a diverse student population. 49 13. Our AMA will work with the AAMC and other stakeholders to create a question for the AAMC 50 electronic medical school application to identify previous pipeline program (also known as 51 CME Rep ort 04-A-23 -- page 12 of 19 pathway program) participation and create a plan to analyze the data in order to determine the 1 effectiveness of pipeline programs. 2 3 Mitigating Demographic and Socioeconomic Inequities in the Residency and Fellowship Selection 4 Process D -310.945 5 Our AMA will: 1. encourage medical schools, medical honor societies, and residency/fellowship 6 programs to work toward ethical, equitable, and transparent recruiting processes, which are made 7 available to all applicants. 8 2. advocate for residency and fellowship programs to avoid using objective criteria available in the 9 Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) application process as the sole determinant for 10 deciding which applicants to offer interviews. 11 3. advocate to r emove membership in medical honor societies as a mandated field of entry on the 12 Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) \u2014thereby limiting its use as an automated 13 screening mechanism \u2014and encourage applicants to share this information within other aspects of 14 the ERAS application. 15 4. advocate for and support innovation in the undergraduate medical education to graduate medical 16 education transition, especially focusing on the efforts of the Accelerating Change in Medical 17 Education initiative, to include pilot efforts to optimize the residency/fellowship application and 18 matching process and encourage the study of the impact of using filters in the Electronic Residency 19 Application Service (ERAS) by program directors on the diversity of entrants into residency. 20 5. encourage caution among medical schools and residency/fellowship programs when utilizing 21 novel online assessments for sampling personal characteristics for the purpose of admissions or 22 selection and monitor use and validity of these tools. 23 24 Clinical Skills Assessment During Medical School D -295.988 25 1. Our AMA will encourage its representatives to the Liaison Committee on Medical Education 26 (LCME) to ask the LCME to determine and disseminate to medical schools a description of what 27 constitutes approp riate compliance with the accreditation standard that schools should \"develop a 28 system of assessment\" to assure that students have acquired and can demonstrate core clinical 29 skills. 30 2. Our AMA will work with the Federation of State Medical Boards, National Board of Medical 31 Examiners, state medical societies, state medical boards, and other key stakeholders to pursue the 32 transition from and replacement for the current United States Medical Licensing Examination 33 (USMLE) Step 2 Clinical Skills (CS) examination and the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical 34 Licensing Examination (COMLEX) Level 2 -Performance Examination (PE) with a requirement to 35 pass a Liaison Committee on Medical Education -accredited or Commission on Osteopathic College 36 Accreditation -accredited medical school -administered, clinical skills examination. 37 3. Our AMA will work to: (a) ensure rapid yet carefully considered changes to the current 38 examination process to reduce costs, including travel expenses, as well as time away from 39 educational pursuits, through immediate steps by the Federation of State Medical Boards and 40 National Board of Medical Examiners; (b) encourage a significant and expeditious increase in the 41 number of available testing sites; (c) allow international students and graduates to take the same 42 examination at any available testing site; (d) engage in a transparent evaluation of basing this 43 examination within our nation's medical schools, rather than administered by an external 44 organization; and (e) include active participation by facult y leaders and assessment experts from 45 U.S. medical schools, as they work to develop new and improved methods of assessing medical 46 student competence for advancement into residency. 47 4. Our AMA is committed to assuring that all medical school graduates enter ing graduate medical 48 education programs have demonstrated competence in clinical skills. 49 CME Rep ort 04-A-23 -- page 13 of 19 5. Our AMA will continue to work with appropriate stakeholders to assure the processes for 1 assessing clinical skills are evidence-based and most efficiently use the ti me and financial 2 resources of those being assessed. 3 6. Our AMA encourages development of a post- examination feedback system for all USMLE test- 4 takers that would: (a) identify areas of satisfactory or better performance; (b) identify areas of 5 suboptimal performance; and (c) give students who fail the exam insight into the areas of 6 unsatisfactory performance on the examination. 7 7. Our AMA, through the Council on Medical Education, will continue to monitor relevant data 8 and engage with stakeholders as necessary should updates to this policy become necessary. 9 10 Competency Based Medical Education Across the Continuum of Education and Practice D- 11 295.317 12 1. Our AMA Council on Medical Education will continue to study and identify challenges and 13 opportunities and critical stakeholders in achieving a competency- based curriculum across the 14 medical education continuum and other health professions that provides significant value to those 15 participating in these curricula and their patients. 16 2. Our AMA Council on Medical Education will work to establish a framework of consistent 17 vocabulary and definitions across the continuum of health sciences education that will facilitate 18 competency -based curriculum, andragogy and assessment implementation. 19 3. Our AMA will continue to explore, with the Accelerating Change in Medical Education 20 initiative and with other stakeholder organizations, the implications of shifting from time -based to 21 competency -based medical education on residents' compensation and lifetime earnings. 22 23 Competency- Based Portfolio Assessment of Medical Students D -295.318 24 1. Our AMA will work with the Association of American Medical Colleges, the American 25 Osteopathic Association and the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, and oth er 26 organizations to examine new and emerging approaches to medical student evaluation, including 27 competency -based portfolio assessment. 28 2. Our AMA will work with the NRMP, ACGME and the 11 schools in the AMA's Accelerating 29 Change in Medical Education consortium to develop pilot projects to study the impact of 30 competency -based frameworks on student graduation, the residency match process and off- cycle 31 entry into residency programs. 32 33 Continued Support for Diversity in Medical Education D-295.963 34 Our AMA will: (1) publicly state and reaffirm its stance on diversity in medical education; (2) 35 request that the Liaison Committee on Medical Education regularly share statistics related to 36 compliance with accreditation standards IS- 16 and MS -8 with medical schools and with other 37 stakeholder groups; (3) work with appropriate stakeholders to commission and enact the 38 recommendations of a forward -looking, cross -continuum, external study of 21st century medical 39 education focused on reimagining the future of health equity and racial justice in medical 40 education, improving the diversity of the health workforce, and ameliorating inequitable outcomes 41 among minoritized and marginalized patient populations; and (4) advocate for funding to support 42 the creation and sustainability of Historically Black College and University (HBCU), Hispanic- 43 Serving Institution (HSI), and Tribal College and University (TCU) affiliated medical schools and 44 residency programs, with the goal of achieving a physician workforce that is proportional to the 45 racial, ethnic, and gender composition of the United States population. 46 47 Decreasing Bias in Evaluations of Medical Student Performance D-295.307 48 Our AMA will work with appropriate stakeholders to promote efforts to evaluate methods for 49 decreasing the impact of bias in medical student performance evaluation as well as reducing the 50 impact of bias in the review of disciplinary actions. 51 CME Rep ort 04-A-23 -- page 14 of 19 1 Fostering Professionalism During Medical School and Residency Training D-295.983 2 (1) Our AMA, in consultation with other relevant medical organizations and associations, will 3 work to develop a framework for fostering professionalism during medical school and residency 4 training. This planning effort should include the following elements: (a) Synthesize existing goals 5 and outcomes for professionalism into a practice-based educational framework, such as provided 6 by the AMA's Principles of Medical Ethics. 7 (b) Examine and suggest revisions to the content of the medical curriculum, based on the desired 8 goals and outcomes for teaching pr ofessionalism. 9 (c) Identify methods for teaching professionalism and those changes in the educational 10 environment, including the use of role models and mentoring, which would support trainees' 11 acquisition of professionalism. 12 (d) Create means to incorporate ongoing collection of feedback from trainees about factors that 13 support and inhibit their development of professionalism. 14 (2) Our AMA, along with other interested groups, will continue to study the clinical training 15 environment to identify the best method s and practices used by medical schools and residency 16 programs to fostering the development of professionalism, to include an evaluation of professional 17 behavior, carried out at regular intervals and employing methods shown to be valuable in adding to 18 the information that can be obtained from observational reports. An ideal system would utilize 19 multiple evaluation formats and would build upon educational experiences that are already in 20 place. The results of such evaluations should be used both for timely fe edback and appropriate 21 interventions for medical students and resident physicians aimed at improving their performance 22 and for summative decisions about progression in training. 23 24 Increase the Representation of Minority and Economically Disadvantaged Popula tions in the 25 Medical Profession H -350.979 26 Our AMA supports increasing the representation of minorities in the physician population by: (1) 27 Supporting efforts to increase the applicant pool of qualified minority students by: (a) Encouraging 28 state and local governments to make quality elementary and secondary education opportunities 29 available to all; (b) Urging medical schools to strengthen or initiate programs that offer special 30 premedical and precollegiate experiences to underrepresented minority students; (c) urging medical 31 schools and other health training institutions to develop new and innovative measures to recruit 32 underrepresented minority students, and (d) Supporting legislation that provides targeted financial 33 aid to financially disadvantaged students at both the collegiate and medical school levels. 34 (2) Encouraging all medical schools to reaffirm the goal of increasing representation of 35 underrepresented minorities in their student bodies and faculties. 36 (3) Urging medical school admission committees to consider minority representation as one factor 37 in reaching their decisions. 38 (4) Increasing the supply of minority health professionals. 39 (5) Continuing its efforts to increase the proportion of minorities in medical schools and medical 40 school faculty. 41 (6) Facilitating communication between medical school admission committees and premedical 42 counselors concerning the relative importance of requirements, including grade point average and 43 Medical College Aptitude Test scores. 44 (7) Continuing to urge for state legislation that will provide funds for medical education both 45 directly to medical schools and indirectly through financial support to students. 46 (8) Continuing to provide strong support for federal legislation that provides financial assistance 47 for able students whose financial need is such that otherwise they would be unable to attend 48 medical school. 49 50 CME Rep ort 04-A-23 -- page 15 of 19 Increasing Demographically Diverse Representation in Liaison Committee on Medical Education 1 Accredited Medical Schools D -295.322 2 Our AMA will continue to study medical school implementation of the Liaison Committee on 3 Medical Education (LCME) Standard IS- 16 and share the results with appropriate accreditation 4 organizations and all state medical associations for action on demographic diversity. 5 6 Supporting Two-Interval Grading Systems for Medical Education H-295.866 7 Our AMA will work with stakeholders to encourage the establishment of a two -interval grading 8 system in medical colleges and universities in the United States for the non -clinical curriculum. 9 10 11 CME Rep ort 04-A-23 -- page 16 of 19 REFERENCES 1 1 Cymet T.

REPORT OF THE COUNCIL ON MEDICAL EDUCATION CME Report 05- A-23 Subject: Support for Institutional Policies for Personal Days for Undergraduate Medical Students (Res olution 314-A-22) Presented by: John P. Williams , MD, Chair Referred to: Reference Committee C Resolution 314- A-22, \"Support for Institutional Policies for Personal Days for Undergraduate 1 Medical Students,\" was authored by the American Medical Association (AMA) Medical Student 2 Section and submitted to the 2022 Annual Meeting of the House of Delegates (HOD). The 3 resolution reads as follows: 4 5 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association encourage medical schools to accept 6 flexible uses for excused absences from clinical clerkships (New HOD Policy); and be it 7 further 8 9 RESOLVED, That our AMA support a clearly defined number of easily accessible personal 10 days for medical students per academic year, which should be explained to students at the 11 beginning of each academic year and a subset of which should be granted without requi ring an 12 explanation on the part of the students. (New HOD Policy) 13 14 The resolution was subsequently referred by the HOD for a report back to the House; this report is 15 in response to the referral. 16 17 BACKGROUND 18 19 Concerns expressed by the resolution's author 20 21 The resolution stresses the frequency of burnout and its impact on the professional development 22 and mental health of medical student s and identifies a lack of protected time as the prominent 23 barrier preventing medical students from accessing mental health treatment. The author expresses 24 concern regarding the inconsistency and lack of standardization of institutional policies for the 25 implementation of excused absences and the level of disclosure required by the students, 26 recognizing that students may not feel comfortable sharing mental health concerns due to 27 professional stigma, shame, or fear of repercussion. 28 29 Reference Committee C testimony on the resolution 30 31 The Reference Committee C report at the 2022 Annual Meeting reflected mixed testimony on this 32 item of business . Some testimony indicated support for this resolution, while others recommended 33 referral for further study due to concerns that using excessive personal days during a given 34 clerkship would have significant repercussions on the quality of education. While there was 35 support for the use of personal days by medical students, it was noted that determining a defined 36 number of personal days pe r academic year may be difficult given the variances across medical 37 CME Rep. 05- A-23 -- page 2 of 11 schools. For these reasons, the resolution was recommended for referral by the reference 1 committee; the HOD subsequently concurred with this recommendation. 2 3 Council on Medical Education testimony on the resolution 4 5 In its testimony, the AMA Council on Medical Education stated that the AMA has a large amount 6 of policy on burnout in medical students, but nothing specific to personal days or less restrictive 7 excused absences. The Council recommended that the resolution be amended by adding the 8 language of the first resolve to current policy D -310.968 (3) , \"Physician and Medical Student 9 Burnout,\" and adding a new resolve that the AMA support a clearly defined number of easily 10 accessible person al days for medical students per academic year, which should be explained to 11 students at the beginning of each academic year and a subset of which should be granted without 12 requiring an explanation on the part of the students. The Council recognized the possibility of 13 misuse of these days but noted that providing for but limiting the number of personal days provides 14 for both greater flexibility as well as privacy for students. 15 16 DISCUSSION 17 18 The goal of undergraduate medical education and awarding of the medical degree is to ensure that 19 medical students have acquired the knowledge, skills , and professional behaviors that pre pare them 20 for a spectrum of career choices in medicine. Medical schools need to create an educational 21 environment that assures that g raduating medical students meet the standards for achieving the 22 medical degree with the flexibility to meet the individual needs of their students. 23 24 Time constraints as a barrier to medical student mental healt h care and well -being 25 26 Burnout among medical s tudents and the need for initiatives to counter burnout are well - 27 documented. Approximately half of U .S. medical students report experiencing burnout , and 28 medical students are more likely than their same -age peers outside of medicine to experience 29 depressio n or depressive symptoms (a prevalence of 27.2 percent )1 and suicidal ideation (overall 30 prevalence of 11.1 percent ).2 Until recently , studies into obtaining timely mental health care 31 treatment and obstacles to care for students have been limite d. However, one of the most frequently 32 cited barriers in this earlier research is lack of time .3 33 34 To gain a more thorough understanding , the University of Michigan conducted a study in 2020 of 35 current and recently graduated medical students, including pre -clinical, core clinical, and clinical 36 elective students. The goal of the study was to identify rates of burnout, barriers to treatment, and 37 program preference s for medical students.4 The results demonstrated the negative impact that lack 38 of time had on medical student access to mental health services as time constraints were the most 39 commonly reported barrier to accessing care . Of the participants who identified barriers to 40 obtaining care (77 of 312 respondents ), 60 percent noted lack of time. In addition, 43 percent of 41 respondents felt that their schedule did not leave them with enough time for personal or family life , 42 another aspect of well -being impacted by time constraints. Students in the study were given the 43 option to provide suggest ions for improvement , with flexibility in pre -clinical and core clerkship 44 schedules the most frequent ly mentioned theme. 45 46 Concerns regarding stigma and potential career impact 47 48 Stigma and fear of professional consequences also influence whether medical students seek mental 49 health treatment. In a 1994 study of first - and second- year medical students at the University of 50 California , San Francisco , School of Medicine , approximately one thi rd of the students identified 51 CME Rep. 05- A-23 -- page 3 of 11 as depressed cited the stigma associated with using mental health services and lack of 1 confidentiality as reasons for not seeking treatment.3 (The questionnaire was constructed to identify 2 the medical students' severity of depression by using the 13- item Beck Depression Inventory, a 3 standardized measure of depression symptoms.) In a 2009 cross -sectional student survey at a large 4 Midwestern medical school, most students cited potential embarrassment and the adverse effect s 5 that disclosing mental illness could have on their professional development.5 6 7 The 2020 University of Michigan study also identified similar sentiments among its medical 8 students. T he aspect of mental health services that student s most endorsed was the guarantee that 9 seeking mental health care would have no negative impact on a student's future career (78 percent ). 10 The study noted that policies concerning the reporting of mental health treatment to residency 11 programs and questions asked by licensing boards are variable and unclear, with many students 12 avoiding treatment for fear that future employers would view such treatment unfavorabl y.4 13 14 Medical education accreditation standards related to student mental health 15 16 The Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) and the Commission on Osteopathic 17 College Accreditation (COCA) have assessed the need for addressing medical student mental 18 health and ha ve issued specific requirements on standards for accreditation to allopathic and 19 osteopathic medical schools, respectively. 20 21 LCME standards (Element 12.3 - Personal Counseling/Mental Health/Well -Being Programs , 22 Element 12.4 - Student Access to Health Care Services, and Element 12.5 Non -Involvement of 23 Providers of Student He alth Services in Student Assessment/Location of Student Health Records ) 24 require that h ealth professionals providing any services, including psychiatric or psychological 25 counseling, should not be involved in the academic assessment or promotion of students in a 26 medical school program. Legal requirements for security, privacy, confidentiality, and accessibility 27 should be met when maintaining medical student health records. Furthermore, these standards state 28 that diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic health services must be accessible to medical school 29 students near the site of their required educational experiences, which may include classroom 30 facilities, rotation sites, etc. Policies should be in place that allow students to be excused to seek 31 necessary health care.6 32 33 COCA standards (Element 5.3 - Safety, Health, and Wellness, Element 9.8 - Mental Health 34 Services, and Element 9.9 Physical Health Services) require that medical schools publish and 35 follow policies related to student, faculty, and staff mental health and wellness and fatigue 36 mitigation; provide students with confidential access to an effective system of counseling and 37 mental health care , with a mental health representative accessible 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, 38 from all locations where students receive education from the medical school; and provide students 39 with access to di agnostic, preventive, and therapeutic health services 24 hours a day, 365 days a 40 year, accessible in all locations where students receive education from the medical school.7 41 42 Medical school attendance policies and impact of absences on education 43 44 Medical school policies regarding excused absences and the use of personal days vary as schools 45 set policy to fit their specific curriculum structure. Therefore, standardization of these policies 46 would prove difficult. 47 48 In a sampling of medical school attendance policies regarding health -related excused absences,8-15 49 acceptable reasons included : illness affecting one's ability to report to the scheduled session and 50 necessary health care services which cannot be rescheduled , such as preventive health services, 51 CME Rep. 05- A-23 -- page 4 of 11 care for chronic illnesses, physical therapy, and counseling/psychological services. In some 1 instances, students were not required to disclose the specific type of health care being sought. 2 Students were strongly encouraged to schedule non- emergency health care appointments during 3 times that do not conflict with classroom and clinical activities. 4 5 The number and timing of absences can impact the quality of the education, and there are many 6 issues to consider, including the potential for accumulation and use of absences over one or more 7 experiences; the active participation required by some curricula r and clinical experiences over a 8 limited number of days; the impact on individual vs. team learning; and student responsibility for 9 the content or experiences missed. Medical schools should recognize that some students will be 10 absent during any curricular component and should develop alternative , timely means for students 11 to achieve curricular goals affected by an absence and avoid educational delays. 12 13 School policy varied regarding the number and timing of excused absences allowed, usually 14 limiting the nu mber of absences per course, block, or year , and with restrictions on use, such as 15 during testing, orientation, or critical learning experiences.8,9,10,11 Some schools allowed these 16 excused absences to be applicable equally across all phases of training (foundational and clinical), 17 while for others absence from clinical duties was more restricted because it would decrease the 18 total amount of time in clinical service and thus impact a valid assessment of clerkship 19 performance .12,13 20 21 In addition to excused absences, several of the schools in the sampling ha d personal day policies. 22 One school ha d core clerkship personal days , with a personal day defined as a day during a 23 required clerkship in the third year when a medical student w ould be excused from the rotation and 24 not required to state the reason . This policy allowed two personal days in the third year, and no 25 more than one personal day could be taken on any individual clerkship. Personal days were 26 restricted in some instances, such as exams, orientation, and assignments in which a student has 27 responsibilities that would impact the clerkship, i.e., overnight or weekend call.14 Another school 28 allow ed students up to three personal day passes during the pre- clerkship phase to attend to 29 personal business. Personal day passes were restricted in some instances, such as exams and 30 interprofessional activities , and a specific reason for using a personal day pass was not required.15 31 32 RELEVANT AMA POLICY 33 34 The AMA has policy in support of identification and management of stress and burnout in students 35 and prioritizing self -care. The most specific policies related to th e topic of this report are as 36 follows: 37 38 D-345.983, \"Study of Medical Student, Resident, and Physician Suicide,\" which support s 39 the education of faculty members, residents , and medical students in the recognition of the 40 signs and symptoms of burnout and depression and access to free, confidential, and 41 immediately available stigma -free mental health and subs tance use disorder services. 42 43 D-405.978, \" Access to Confidential Health Care Services for Physicians and Trainees,\" 44 which includes advocating that medical students maintain self -care and are supported by 45 their institutions in their self -care efforts. 46 47 H-295.858, \"Access to Confidential Health Services for Medical Students and Physicians,\" 48 which in part asks that accreditation bodies encourage medical schools to make available 49 confidential health care in reasonable proximity to the education/tr aining site and consider 50 CME Rep. 05- A-23 -- page 5 of 11 designating some segment of already -allocated personal time off specifically for routine 1 health screening and preventive services. 2 3 H-405.960, \" Policies for Parental, Family and Medical Necessity Leave,\" which in part 4 encourages medical schools to develop written policies on parental leave, family leave, and 5 medical leave for medical students, including how time can be made up in order for 6 medical students to be eligible for graduation with minimal or no delays, and whether 7 schedu le accommodations are allowed. 8 9 These policies are listed in full detail in A ppendix A. 10 11 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS 12 13 Resolution 314- A-22 requests that the AMA 1) encourage medical schools to accept flexible uses 14 for excused absences from clinical clerkships and 2) support a clearly defined number of easily 15 accessible personal days for medical students per academic year, some of which should be granted 16 without requi ring an explanation on the part of the students. 17 18 Time constraints and the fear of stigma and negative professional consequences are key barriers to 19 medical student access to care. Existing AMA policy supports the identification and management 20 of medical student burnout and the prioritization of self -care by medical students and their 21 institutions, including the allocation of time and access to services. However, t he impact of excused 22 absences on medical student education must be considered carefully, incl uding their use, quantity, 23 and timing, as medical schools create and implement policy with their own curriculum structures in 24 mind. 25 26 The Council on Medical Education therefore recommends that the following recommendation be 27 adopted in lieu of Resolution 314- A-22 and the remainder of th is report be filed : 28 29 1. That our AMA support a requirement that each medical school have policy defining 1) the 30 number of days a medical student may be excused from each curricular component ; 2) the 31 processes for using excused absences, providing alternative , timely means of achieving 32 curricular goals when absen t from a curricular component ; and 3) effective mechanisms to 33 communicate these policies at appropriate times throughout the curriculum ; and that 34 schools be encouraged to create a mechanism by which at least some portion of such days 35 can be used without requiring explanation. (New HOD Policy) 36 Fiscal note: TBD CME Rep. 05-A-23 -- page 6 of 11 APPENDIX: RELEVANT AMA POLICY D-345.983, \"Study of Medical Student, Resident, and Physician Suicide\" Our AMA will: (1) explore t he viability and cost-effectiveness of regularly collecting National Death Index (NDI) data and confidentially maintaining manner of death information for physicians, residents, and medical students listed as deceased in the AMA Physician Masterfile for lo ng-term studies; (2) monitor progress by the Association of American Medical Colleges, the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine, and the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) to collect data on medical student and resident/fellow suicides to identify patterns that could predict such events; (3) support the education of faculty members, residents and medical students in the recognition of the signs and symptoms of burnout and depression and supports access to free, confidential, and immediately available stigma -free mental health and substance use disorder services; (4) collaborate with other stakeholders to study the incidence of and risk factors for depression, substance misuse and substance use disorders, and attempted and completed suicide among physicians, residents, and medical students; and (5) work with appropriate stakeholders to explore the viability of developing a standardized reporting mechanism for the collection of current wellness initiatives that inst itutions have in place to inform and promote meaningful mental health and wellness interventions in these populations. (CME Rep. 06, A-19; Modified: Res. 326, A-22) D-405.978, \"Access to Confidential Health Care Services for Physicians and Trainees\" 1. Our AMA will advocate that: (a) physicians, medical students and all mem bers of the health care team (i) maintain self -care, (ii) are supported by their institutions in their self -care efforts, and (iii) in order to maintain the confidentiality of care, have access to affordable health care, including mental and physical health care, outside of their place of work or education; and (b) employers support access to mental and physical health care including but not limited to providing access to out-of-network in person and/or via telemedicine, thereby reducing stigma, eliminating discrimination, and removing other barriers to treatment. 2. Our AMA will advocate for best practices to ensure physicians, medical students and all members of the health care teams have access to appropriate behavioral, mental, primary, and specialty health care and addiction services. (Res. 7, I-20) H-295.858, \" Access to Confidential Health Services for Medical Students and Physicians \" 1. Our AMA will ask the Liaison Committee on Medical Education, Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation, American Osteopath ic Association, and Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education to encourage medical schools and residency/fellowship programs, respectively, to: A. Provide or facilitate the immediate availability of urgent and emergent access to low-cost, confi dential health care, including mental health and substance use disorder counseling services, that: ( 1) include appropriate follow-up; (2) are outside the trainees' grading and evaluation pathways; and (3) are available (based on patient preference and need for assurance of confidentiality) in reasonable proximity to the education/training site, at an external site, or through telemedicine or other virtual, online means; B. Ensure that residency/fellowship programs are abiding by all duty hour restrictions, as these regulations exist in part to ensure the mental and physical health of trainees; CME Rep. 05- A-23 -- page 7 of 11 C. Encourage and promote routine health screening among medical students and resident/fellow physicians, and consider designating some segment of already- allocated p ersonal time off (if necessary, during scheduled work hours) specifically for routine health screening and preventive services, including physical, mental, and dental care; and D. Remind trainees and practicing physicians to avail themselves of any needed resources, both within and external to their institution, to provide for their mental and physical health and well- being, as a component of their professional obligation to ensure their own fitness for duty and the need to prioritize patient safety and quality of care by ensuring appropriate self -care, not working when sick, and following generally accepted guidelines for a healthy lifestyle. 2. Our AMA will urge state medical boards to refrain from asking applicants about past history of mental health or substance use disorder diagnosis or treatment, and only focus on current impairment by mental illness or addiction, and to accept \"safe haven\" non -reporting for physicians seeking licensure or relicensure who are undergoing treatment for mental health or addiction issues, to help ensure confidentiality of such treatment for the individual physician while providing assurance of patient safety. 3. Our AMA encourages medical schools to create mental health and substance abuse awareness and suicide prevention screening programs that would: A. be available to all medical students on an opt -out basis; B. ensure anonymity, confidentiality, and protection from administrative action; C. provide proactive intervention for identified at -risk students by mental health and addiction professionals; and D. inform students and faculty about personal mental health, substance use and addiction, and other risk factors that may contribute to sui cidal ideation. 4. Our AMA: (a) encourages state medical boards to consider physical and mental conditions similarly; (b) encourages state medical boards to recognize that the presence of a mental health condition does not necessarily equate with an impair ed ability to practice medicine; and (c) encourages state medical societies to advocate that state medical boards not sanction physicians based solely on the presence of a psychiatric disease, irrespective of treatment or behavior. 5. Our AMA: (a) encoura ges study of medical student mental health, including but not limited to rates and risk factors of depression and suicide; (b) encourages medical schools to confidentially gather and release information regarding reporting rates of depression/suicide on an opt -out basis from its students; and (c) will work with other interested parties to encourage research into identifying and addressing modifiable risk factors for burnout, depression and suicide across the continuum of medical education. 6. Our AMA encou rages the development of alternative methods for dealing with the problems of student -physician mental health among medical schools, such as: (a) introduction to the concepts of physician impairment at orientation; (b) ongoing support groups, consisting of students and house staff in various stages of their education; (c) journal clubs; (d) fraternities; (e) support of the concepts of physical and mental well -being by heads of departments, as well as other faculty members; and/or (f) the opportunity for int erested students and house staff to work with students who are having difficulty. Our AMA supports making these alternatives available to students at the earliest possible point in their medical education. 7. Our AMA will engage with the appropriate organ izations to facilitate the development of educational resources and training related to suicide risk of patients, medical students, residents/fellows, practicing physicians, and other health care professionals, using an evidence - based multidisciplinary app roach. (CME Rep. 01, I -16; Appended: Res. 301, A -17; Appended: Res. 303, A -17; Modified: CME Rep. 01, A -18; Appended: Res. 312, A -18; Reaffirmed: BOT Rep. 15, A -19; Reaffirmed: Res. 228, I -22) CME Rep. 05-A-23 -- page 8 of 11 H-405.960, \" Policies for Parental, Family and Medical Necessity Leave\" AMA adopts as policy the following guidelines for, and encourages the implementation of, Parental, Family and Medical Necessity Leave for Medical Students and Physicians: 1. Our AMA urges residency training programs, me dical specialty boards, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, and medical group practices to incorporate and/or encourage development of leave policies, including parental, family, and medical leave policies, as part of the physician's standard benefit agreement. 2. Recommended components of parental leave policies for physicians include: (a) duration of leave allowed before and after delivery; (b) category of leave credited; (c) whether leave is paid or unpaid; (d) whether provision is made for continuation of insurance benefits during leave, and who pays the premium; (e) whether sick leave and vacation time may be accrued from year to year or used in advance; (f) how much time must be made up in order to be considered board eligible; (g ) whether make -up time will be paid; (h) whether schedule accommodations are allowed; and (i) leave policy for adoption. 3. AMA policy is expanded to include physicians in practice, reading as follows: (a) residency program directors and group practice adm inistrators should review federal law concerning maternity leave for guidance in developing policies to assure that pregnant physicians are allowed the same sick leave or disability benefits as those physicians who are ill or disabled; (b) staffing levels and scheduling are encouraged to be flexible enough to allow for coverage without creating intolerable increases in other physicians' workloads, particularly in residency programs; and (c) physicians should be able to return to their practices or training programs after taking parental leave without the loss of status. 4. Our AMA will study the impact on and feasibility of medical schools, residency programs, specialty boards, and medical group practices incorporating into their parental leave policies a 12- week minimum leave allowance, with the understanding that no parent be required to take a minimum leave. 5. Our AMA recommends that medical practices, departments and training programs strive to provide 12 weeks of paid parental, family and medical necessity leave in a 12 -month period for their attending and trainee physicians as needed. 6. Residency program directors should review federal and state law for guidance in developing policies for parental, family, and medical leave. 7. Medical students and physicians who are unable to work because of pregnancy, childbirth, abortion or stillbirth, and other related medical conditions should be entitled to such leave and other benefits on the same basis as other physicians who are temporarily unable to work for o ther medical reasons. 8. Residency programs should develop written policies on leave for physicians. Such written policies should include the following elements: (a) leave policy for birth or adoption; (b) duration of leave allowed before and after deliver y; (c) duration of leave allowed after abortion or stillbirth; (d) category of leave credited (e.g., sick, vacation, parental, unpaid leave, short term disability); (e) whether leave is paid or unpaid; (f) whether provision is made for continuation of insu rance benefits during leave and who pays for premiums; (g) whether sick leave and vacation time may be accrued from year to year or used in advance; (h) extended leave for resident physicians with extraordinary and long- term personal or family medical trag edies for periods of up to one year, without loss of previously accepted residency positions, for devastating conditions such as terminal illness, permanent disability, or complications of pregnancy that threaten maternal or fetal life; (i) how time can be made up in order for a resident physician to be considered board eligible; (j) what period of leave would result in a resident physician being required to complete an extra or delayed year of training; (k) whether time spent in making up a leave will be paid; and (l) whether schedule accommodations are allowed, such as reduced hours, no night call, modified rotation schedules, and permanent part-time scheduling. CME Rep. 05- A-23 -- page 9 of 11 9. Medical schools should develop written policies on parental leave, family leave, and medical leave for medical students. Such written policies should include the following elements: (a) leave policy for birth or adoption; (b) duration of leave allowed before and after delivery; (c) extended leave for medical students with extraordinary and long -term personal or family medical tragedies, without loss of previously accepted medical school seats, for devastating conditions such as terminal illness, permanent disability, or complications of pregnancy that threaten maternal or fetal life; (d) how time can be made up in order for a medical students to be eligible for graduation with minimal or no delays; (e) what period of leave would result in a medical student being required to complete an extra or delayed year of training; and (f) whether schedule acc ommodations are allowed, such as modified rotation schedules, no night duties, and flexibility with academic testing schedules. 10. Our AMA endorses the concept of equal parental leave for birth and adoption as a benefit for resident physicians, medical st udents, and physicians in practice regardless of gender or gender identity. 11. Staffing levels and scheduling are encouraged to be flexible enough to allow for coverage without creating intolerable increases in the workloads of other physicians, particula rly those in residency programs. 12. Physicians should be able to return to their practices or training programs after taking parental leave, family leave, or medical leave without the loss of status. 13. Residency program directors must assist residents i n identifying their specific requirements (for example, the number of months to be made up) because of leave for eligibility for board certification and must notify residents on leave if they are in danger of falling below minimal requirements for board el igibility. Program directors must give these residents a complete list of requirements to be completed in order to retain board eligibility. 14. Our AMA encourages flexibility in residency programs and medical schools incorporating parental leave and alter native schedules for pregnant trainees. 15. In order to accommodate leave protected by the federal Family and Medical Leave Act, our AMA encourages all specialties within the American Board of Medical Specialties to allow graduating residents to extend tra ining up to 12 weeks after the traditional residency completion date while still maintaining board eligibility in that year. 16. Our AMA will work with appropriate stakeholders to encourage that residency programs annually publish and share with FREIDA and other appropriate stakeholders, (a) self -identified and other demographic data, including but not limited to the composition of their program over the last 5 years by age; historically marginalized, minoritized, or excluded status; sexual orientation and gender identity. 17. Our AMA will encourage the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education and other relevant stakeholders to annually collect data on childbirth and parenthood from all accredited US residency programs and publish this data with disaggregation by gender identity and specialty. 18.

REPORT OF THE COUNCIL ON MEDICAL EDUCATION CME Report 06-A-23 Subject: Modifying Financial Assistance Eligibility Criteria for Medical School Applicant s Presented by: John P. Williams , MD, Chair Referred to: Reference Committee C 1 At its 2022 Annual Meeting, the American Medical Association ( AMA) House of Delegates 2 (HOD) adopted Polic y D-305.950 , \"Modifying Financial Assistance Eligibility Criteria for Medical 3 School Applicants,\" which directs the AMA to : 4 5 work with the Association of American Medical Colleges, American Association of Colleges 6 of Osteopathic Medicine, and other appropriate stakeholders to study process reforms that 7 could help mitigate the high cost of applying to medical school for low- incom e applicants, 8 including better targeting application fee waivers through broadened eligibility criteria. 9 10 Testimony during the meeting expressed concern that applicants to medical school are often 11 required to disclose their parental financial information, regardless of whether the applicant would 12 individually meet a lower income threshold or are eligible for extensive financial aid through 13 federal programs. This report will review the application process as well as the fee assistance 14 programs a nd discuss reforms and resources to further aid individuals struggling to afford the high 15 costs of application to medical school. 16 17 BACKGROUND 18 19 Journey into medical school and associated costs 20 21 The preparation to apply to medical school begins well before filling out an application form, 22 starting with completion of high school education or General Education Development t est (GED) , 23 as required for entry into an undergraduate degree program. According t o the National Center for 24 Education Statisti cs (NCES) , 86 percent of students earned a diploma at the end of the 2018-2019 25 school year \u2014 an all -time high. Asian/Pacific Islander students had the highest adjusted cohort 26 graduation rate (93 percent), followed by White (89 percent), Hispanic (82 percent), Black (80 27 percent), and American Indian/Alaska Native (74 percent) students. 1 28 29 The following table p rovides detail regarding the related steps for entry into medical school and 30 their related costs (as of 2023) : 31 CME Rep. 06-A-23 -- page 2 of 16 Requirement MD DO Associated costs Undergraduate program (average 4 years) Tuition, books, and related fees. Completion of bachelor's degree, inclusive of prerequisite courses. Some students may qualify for scholarships or waivers.

Electronic device, internet access. Medical school interviews (virtual or in person) Costs may vary depending on mode of travel, lodging, attire, meals per interview location. Electronic device, internet access. *2022 data indicates an average of 1 8 primary applications per applicant ( 990,790 applications were submitted by 5 5,188 1 applicants ).6 2 CME Rep. 06-A-23 -- page 3 of 16 Acceptance into medical school is an expensive and time-consumi ng endeavor. Many applicants 1 are financially assisted by others ( parents, guardians) to pursue this process ; however, s ome 2 students are not financially dependent on their parents \u2014 for a variety of reasons . Yet the 3 applications often require the applicant to disclose parental financial information . Further, this 4 requirement does not seem to consider whether the applicant would individually without parental 5 income meet a lower income threshold or be eligible for financial aid . 6 7 Financial assistance for medical school applications fees 8 9 AMCAS\u00ae application to allopathic medical school 10 11 The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) offers the American Medical College 12 Application Service\u00ae (AMCAS\u00ae), a centralized medical school application processing serv ice used 13 by m ost U.S. medical schools as the primary application method for their first -year entering 14 classes. The subsection of the application called \"Childhood Information\" asks questions about the 15 applicant 's \"parents and guardians\" as well as how the applicant paid for an undergraduate 16 education. It asks about percent scholarship, percent parental contribution, and percent of 17 contribution from self. The applicant is able to respond \"don't know\" or \" decline to answer\" to the 18 question about family income. According to the 2023 AMCAS\u00ae Applicant Guide , it uses such 19 terms as \"immediate family ,\" \"medically unders erved ,\" \"state or federal programs,\" and 20 \"Pell G rants .\" See Appendix A for examples of relevant questions in the AMCAS application. 21 22 The AAMC's Fee Assistance Program (FAP) assists those who, without financial assistance, would 23 otherwise be unable to take the Medical College Admission Test\u00ae (MCAT\u00ae), apply to medical 24 schools that use the American Medical College Application Service\u00ae (AMCAS\u00ae), etc. This 25 program requires the applicant, if under age 26, to provide their parents' financial information and 26 supporting tax do cumentation regardless of the applicant's marital status, tax filing status 27 (independent or dependent), parents' country of residence, or whether the ir parents are willing to 28 provide documentation. Exemptions from providing parental information include if the applicant: 29 is legally emancipated , 30 does not know if a parent is living, 31 does not have a relationship with a parent and does not communicate with them, 32 was in foster care or in the care of a legal guardian at the time they reached the age of 33 majority , 34 another circumstance that prohibits the obtaining of parent's financial information.7 35 In addition, exemption will be made if the parent is deceased, incarcerat ed, institutionalized, or 36 permanently incapacitated or hospitalized. 37 38 AACOMAS application to osteopathic medical school 39 40 Similar to AMCAS, the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (AACOM) 41 offers their own Application Service (AACOMAS) . This application has a section entitled \"Family 42 Information\" which requires the applicant to provide parents' names, note if parents are living or 43 deceased , and provide any relatives who are DOs or MDs. It also asks optional questions about 44 parents ' occupation, residency, education, and household. A section called \"Other information\" 45 collects \"background information\" that includes questions related t o family income . Explanations 46 are provided in the Applicant Help Center . See Appendix B for examples of relevant questions in 47 the A ACOMAS application. 48 CME Rep. 06-A-23 -- page 4 of 16 AACOM offers the Fee Waiver Program . Students must apply to th is program and receive 1 approval, if applicable, before submitting their AACOMAS application. A pplicant Help Center 2 provides a dditional information on eligibility . Applicants who are not listed as a \"dependent\" on a 3 previously filed Federal Income Tax Return Form 1040 are classified as \"independent applicants.\" 4 AACOM requires the applicant to submit both their own and their parent or guardian's 1040 forms . 5 6 Federal financial assistance requirements 7 8 Definition of \" low-income \" 9 10 The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) defines \" low-income levels \" used for 11 various health professions as authorized in Titles III, VII, and VIII of the Public Health Service 12 Act. This information is periodically published in the Federal Register. Effective January 12, 2022, 13 a \"low-income family/household\" is defined as having an annual income that does not exceed 200 14 percent of HHS 's poverty guidelines.8 \"A family is a group of two or more individuals related by 15 birth, marriage, or adoption who live together. Most HRSA program s use the income of a student 's 16 parent(s) to compute low -income status. However, a 'household' may potentially be only one 17 person.\"8 Low-income levels are adjusted annually based on poverty thresholds published by the 18 U.S. Census Bureau. 19 20 Free Application for Federal Student Aid 21 22 The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FASFA\u00ae), offered by the U.S. Department of 23 Education, is a mechanism for students to apply for federal grants, work -study, and loans before 24 each year of college. Such institutions use FAFSA data to determine an applican t's federal aid 25 eligibility. The FASFA form makes clear that the student is the one applying for financial aid . 26 Dependent students and their parents/guardians must both create FASFA IDs online and provide 27 parental information in the application. If a paren t does not have a Social Security number (SSN), 28 they w ill not be able to create an F ASFA ID (which requires an SSN). Unfortunately, this presents 29 challenges for many parents who are not U.S. citizens. The FASFA program currently defines an 30 \"independent student \" as one of the following: 31 born before Jan. 1, 1999 32 married 33 a graduate or professional student 34 a veteran 35 a member of the armed forces 36 an orphan 37 a ward of the cour t 38 someone with legal dependents other than a spouse 39 an emancipated minor 40 someone who is homeless or at risk of becoming homeless.9 41 42 DISCUSSION 43 44 Recent changes 45 46 Changes to application forms as well as the programs that create and maintain the forms are likely 47 to impact the students who apply, or wish to apply, to medical school. Recent examples of changes 48 are explained below. 49 CME Rep. 06-A-23 -- page 5 of 16 FAP reforms 1 2 In 2022, the AAMC introduced the following changes to the FAP: 3 Free and discounted items related to the MCAT and MSAR as noted in the table above. 4 Open to everyone with a permanent U.S. address. Reference to U .S. citizenship and certain 5 visa status eligibility requirements have been removed. 6 Parental financial information is NOT required for applicants over age 26 on the day the 7 application is submitted. Eligibility depends on income and poverty guidelines. 8 Benefits are not retroactive. If awarded fee assistance, the applicant cannot apply benefits 9 to previous registrations or purchases. 10 Fee for secondary application s may be waived at some medical schools.10 11 12 Of note, many medical students apply and enter when they are younger than 26 (likely ages 22 -24). 13 Therefore, this benefit may not help most applicants. 14 15 Blockage of the Biden Administration debt relief program 16 17 Due to the economic challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Biden- Harris 18 Administration issued a debt relief program to 19 extend the pause on student loan repayment s a few times , whereby no one with a federally 20 held loan has had make a l oan payments since President Biden took office, 21 \"provide up to $20,000 in debt relief to Pell Grant recipients with loans held by the 22 Department of Education (DOE) and up to $10,000 in debt relief to non-P ell Grant 23 recipients. Borrowers are eligible for this relief if their individual income is less than 24 $125,000 or $250,000 for households. In addition, borrowers who are employed by non- 25 profits, the military, or federal, state, Tribal, or local government may be eligible to have 26 all of their student loans forgiven through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) 27 program,\" 28 propose a rule change to create a new income-driven repayment plan to reduce future 29 monthly payments for lower - and middle- incom e applicants . 11 30 31 However, courts have issued orders blocking this student debt relief program and, as a result, 32 applications are not being accepted at this time . This halt to the application process is likely having 33 a real impact on medical school applicants. The Administration is seeking to overturn those orders. 34 Thus, the student loan payment pause is extended until the DOE is permitted to implement the 35 program or the litigation is resolved ; if not r esolved by June 30, 2023, then payments will res ume 36 60 days after that.11 37 38 RELEVANT AMA POLICIES 39 40 The AMA has several related policies in place address ing medical school cost, debt, and diversity ; 41 however, none specifically address the cost and aspects of the application form itself. Related 42 policies ar e listed here, and full text is available in Appendix C. 43 H-295.888, Progress in Medical Education: the Medical School Admission Process 44 D-200.985, Strategies for Enhancing Diversity in the Physician Workforce 45 H-305.925, Pr inciples of and Actions to Address Medical Education Costs and Student 46 Debt 47 H-305.988, Cos t and Financing of Medical Education and Availability of First Year 48 Residency Positions 49 CME Rep. 06-A-23 -- page 6 of 16 H-350.979, Increase the Representation of Minority and Economically Disadvantaged 1 Populations in the Medical Profession 2 D-295.303, S upport Hybrid Interview Techniques for Entry to Graduate Medical 3 Education 4 H-255.968, A dvance Tuition Payment Requirements for International Students Enrolled in 5 US Medical Schools 6 7 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS 8 9 The entire process surrounding acceptance into medical school is costly and time -consuming. The 10 application itself is a significant expense and may require the student to disclose information about 11 their parents and related income, even if the student is not being financially supported by them. 12 Some families may financially support students but struggle to do so. Given limited resource s, 13 financial programs should prioritize low -income families and/or independent students. Further 14 study is needed in order to propose equitable process reforms that could help mitigate the high cost 15 of applying to medical school , particularly for low- income students. 16 17 The Council on Medical Education therefore recommends that the following recommendations be 18 adopted, and the remainder of this report be filed: 19 20 1. That AMA policy D-305.950 , Modifying Financial Assistance Eligibility Criteria for 21 Medical School Applicants, be amended by addition and deletion to read as follows: 22 23 1. Our AMA will work with encourage the Association of American Medical Colleges, and 24 American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine, and other appropriate 25 stakeholders to study process reforms that could help to mitigate the high cost of applying 26 to medical school for lo w-income applicants, including better targeting application fee 27 waivers through broadened eligibility criteria , and ensure cost parity among applicants to 28 DO and MD granting institutions. 29 30 2. Our AMA will encourage the Association of American Medical Colleges, American 31 Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine, and U.S. Department of Education to 32 reevaluate application forms to financial aid programs such as the Fee Assistance Program 33 (FAP) , Fee W aiver P rogram (FWP) , and Free Application for Federal Aid (FASFA) to 34 broaden eligibility criteria for low -income students. 35 36 3. Our AMA will commend the U.S. Department of Education for remov ing references to 37 parental/guardian income for all medical students in the Free Application for Federal Aid 38 (FASFA) . 39 40 4. Our AMA will encourage the Association of American Medical Colleges and American 41 Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine as well as medical school and state-based 42 financial aid programs to remove references to parental/guardian income for all medical 43 students and follow the U.S. Department of Education's definition of \"independent 44 student\" as described in the Free Application for Federal Aid (FASFA).

CME Rep. 06-A-23 -- page 10 of 16 APPENDIX C Relevant policies H-295.888, Progress in Medical Education: the Medical School Admission Process 1. Our AMA encourages: (A) research on ways to reliably evaluate the personal qualities (such as empathy, integrity, commitment to service) of applicants to medical school and support broad dissemination of the results. Medical schools should be encouraged to give significant weight to these qualities in the admissions process; (B) premedical coursework in the humanities, behavioral sciences, and social sciences, as a way to ensure a broadly -educated applicant pool; and (C) dissemination of models that allow medical schools to meet thei r goals related to diversity in the context of existing legal requirements, for example through outreach to elementary schools, high schools, and colleges. 2. Our AMA: (A) will continue to work with the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) and o ther relevant organizations to encourage improved assessment of personal qualities in the recruitment process for medical school applicants including types of information to be solicited in applications to medical school; (B) will work with the AAMC and ot her relevant organizations to explore the range of measures used to assess personal qualities among applicants, including those used by related fields; (C) encourages the development of innovative methodologies to assess personal qualities among medical school applicants; (D) will work with medical schools and other relevant stakeholder groups to review the ways in which medical schools communicate the importance of personal qualities among applicants, including how and when specified personal qualities wil l be assessed in the admissions process; (E) encourages continued research on the personal qualities most pertinent to success as a medical student and as a physician to assist admissions committees to adequately assess applicants; and (F) encourages conti nued research on the factors that impact negatively on humanistic and empathetic traits of medical students during medical school. D-200.985, Strategies for Enhancing Diversity in the Physician Workforce 1. Our AMA, independently and in collaboration with other groups such as the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), will actively work and advocate for funding at the federal and state levels and in the private sector to support the following: (a) Pipeline programs to prepare and motivate members of underrepresented groups to enter medical school; (b) Diversity or minority affairs offices at med ical schools; (c) Financial aid programs for students from groups that are underrepresented in medicine; and (d) Financial support programs to recruit and develop faculty members from underrepresented groups. 2. Our AMA will work to obtain full restoration and protection of federal Title VII funding, and similar state funding programs, for the Centers of Excellence Program, Health Careers Opportunity Program, Area Health Education Centers, and other programs that support physician training, recruitment, and retention in geographically- underserved areas. 3. Our AMA will take a leadership role in efforts to enhance diversity in the physician workforce, including engaging in broad-based efforts that involve partners within and beyond the medical profession and medical education community. 4. Our AMA will encourage the Liaison Committee on Medical Education to assure that medical schools demonstrate compliance with its requirements for a diverse student body and faculty. 5. Our AMA will develop an internal educat ion program for its members on the issues and possibilities involved in creating a diverse physician population. 6. Our AMA will provide on- line educational materials for its membership that address diversity issues in patient care including, but not limit ed to, culture, religion, race and ethnicity. CME Rep. 06-A-23 -- page 11 of 16 7. Our AMA will create and support programs that introduce elementary through high school students, especially those from groups that are underrepresented in medicine (URM), to healthcare careers. 8. Our AMA wi ll create and support pipeline programs and encourage support services for URM college students that will support them as they move through college, medical school and residency programs. 9. Our AMA will recommend that medical school admissions committees and residency/fellowship programs use holistic assessments of applicants that take into account the diversity of preparation and the variety of talents that applicants bring to their education with the goal of improving health care for all communities. 10. Our AMA will advocate for the tracking and reporting to interested stakeholders of demographic information pertaining to URM status collected from Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) applications through the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP). 11. Our AMA will continue the research, advocacy, collaborative partnerships and other work that was initiated by the Commission to End Health Care Disparities. 12. Our AMA opposes legislation that would undermine institutions' ability to properly employ affirmative action to promote a diverse student population. 13. Our AMA will work with the AAMC and other stakeholders to create a question for the AAMC electronic medical school application to identify previous pipeline program (also known as pathway program) participation and create a plan to analyze the data in order to determine the effectiveness of pipeline programs. H-305.925, Pr inciples of and Actions to Address Medical Education Costs and Student Debt The costs of medical education should never be a barrier to the pursuit of a career in medicine nor to the decision to practice in a given speci alty. To help address this issue, our American Medical Association (AMA) will: 1. Collaborate with members of the Federation and the medical education community, and with other interested organizations, to address the cost of medical education and medical student debt through public- and private -sector advocacy. 2. Vigorously advocate for and support expansion of and adequate funding for federal scholarship and loan repayment programs --such as those from the National Health Service Corps, Indian Health Service, Armed Forces, and Department of Veterans Affairs, and for comparable programs from states and the private sector --to promote practice in underserved areas, the military, and academic medicine or clinical research. 3. Encourage the expansion of National Institutes of Health programs that provide loan repayment in exchange for a commitment to conduct targeted research. 4. Advocate for increased funding for the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program to assure adequate funding of prim ary care within the National Health Service Corps, as well as to permit: (a) inclusion of all medical specialties in need, and (b) service in clinical settings that care for the underserved but are not necessarily located in health professions shortage are as. 5. Encourage the National Health Service Corps to have repayment policies that are consistent with other federal loan forgiveness programs, thereby decreasing the amount of loans in default and increasing the number of physicians practicing in underser ved areas. 6. Work to reinstate the economic hardship deferment qualification criterion known as the \"20/220 pathway,\" and support alternate mechanisms that better address the financial needs of trainees with educational debt. 7. Advocate for federal legis lation to support the creation of student loan savings accounts that allow for pre-tax dollars to be used to pay for student loans. 8. Work with other concerned organizations to advocate for legislation and regulation that would result in favorable terms and conditions for borrowing and for loan repayment, and would permit CME Rep. 06- A-23 -- page 12 of 16 100% tax deductibility of interest on student loans and elimination of taxes on aid from service - based programs. 9. Encourage the creation of private -sector financial aid programs with fa vorable interest rates or service obligations (such as community- or institution -based loan repayment programs or state medical society loan programs). 10. Support stable funding for medical education programs to limit excessive tuition increases, and collect and disseminate information on medical school programs that cap medical education debt, including the types of debt management education that are provided. 11. Work with state medical societies to advocate for the creation of either tuition caps or, if caps are not feasible, pre- defined tuition increases, so that medical students will be aware of their tuition and fee costs for the total period of their enrollment. 12. Encourage medical schools to (a) Study the costs and benefits associated with non- traditional instructional formats (such as online and distance learning, and combined baccalaureate/MD or DO programs) to determine if cost savings to medical schools and to medical students could be realized without jeopardizing the quality of medical educat ion; (b) Engage in fundraising activities to increase the availability of scholarship support, with the support of the Federation, medical schools, and state and specialty medical societies, and develop or enhance financial aid opportunities for medical students, such as self -managed, low -interest loan programs; (c) Cooperate with postsecondary institutions to establish collaborative debt counseling for entering first -year medical students; (d) Allow for flexible scheduling for medical students who encounte r financial difficulties that can be remedied only by employment, and consider creating opportunities for paid employment for medical students; (e) Counsel individual medical student borrowers on the status of their indebtedness and payment schedules prior to their graduation; (f) Inform students of all government loan opportunities and disclose the reasons that preferred lenders were chosen; (g) Ensure that all medical student fees are earmarked for specific and well -defined purposes, and avoid charging any overly broad and ill -defined fees, such as but not limited to professional fees; (h) Use their collective purchasing power to obtain discounts for their students on necessary medical equipment, textbooks, and other educational supplies; (i) Work to ensur e stable funding, to eliminate the need for increases in tuition and fees to compensate for unanticipated decreases in other sources of revenue; mid- year and retroactive tuition increases should be opposed. 13. Support and encourage state medical societies to support further expansion of state loan repayment programs, particularly those that encompass physicians in non- primary care specialties. 14. Take an active advocacy role during reauthorization of the Higher Education Act and similar legislation, to ac hieve the following goals: (a) Eliminating the single holder rule; (b) Making the availability of loan deferment more flexible, including broadening the definition of economic hardship and expanding the period for loan deferment to include the entire lengt h of residency and fellowship training; (c) Retaining the option of loan forbearance for residents ineligible for loan deferment; (d) Including, explicitly, dependent care expenses in the definition of the \"cost of attendance\"; (e) Including room and board expenses in the definition of tax- exempt scholarship income; (f) Continuing the federal Direct Loan Consolidation program, including the ability to \"lock in\" a fixed interest rate, and giving consideration to grace periods in renewals of federal loan programs; (g) Adding the ability to refinance Federal Consolidation Loans; (h) Eliminating the cap on the student loan interest deduction; (i) Increasing the income limits for taking the interest deduction; (j) Making permanent the education tax incentives tha t our AMA successfully lobbied for as part of Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001; (k) Ensuring that loan repayment programs do not place greater burdens upon married couples than for similarly situated couples who are cohabitating; ( l) Increasing efforts to collect overdue debts from the present medical student loan programs in a manner that would not interfere with the provision of future loan funds to medical students. CME Rep. 06- A-23 -- page 13 of 16 15. Continue to work with state and county medical societies to advocate for adequate levels of medical school funding and to oppose legislative or regulatory provisions that would result in significant or unplanned tuition increases. 16. Continue to study medical education financing, so as to identify long- term strate gies to mitigate the debt burden of medical students, and monitor the short -and long -term impact of the economic environment on the availability of institutional and external sources of financial aid for medical students, as well as on choice of specialty and practice location. 17. Collect and disseminate information on successful strategies used by medical schools to cap or reduce tuition. 18. Continue to monitor the availability of and encourage medical schools and residency/fellowship programs to (a) provide financial aid opportunities and financial planning/debt management counseling to medical students and resident/fellow physicians; (b) work with key stakeholders to develop and disseminate standardized information on these topics for use by medical students, resident/fellow physicians, and young physicians; and (c) share innovative approaches with the medical education community. 19. Seek federal legislation or rule changes that would stop Medicare and Medicaid decertification of physicians due to unpai d student loan debt. The AMA believes that it is improper for physicians not to repay their educational loans, but assistance should be available to those physicians who are experiencing hardship in meeting their obligations. 20. Related to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program, our AMA supports increased medical student and physician participation in the program, and will: (a) Advocate that all resident/fellow physicians have access to PSLF during their training years; (b) Advocate against a monetary cap on PSLF and other federal loan forgiveness programs; (c) Work with the United States Department of Education to ensure that any cap on loan forgiveness under PSLF be at least equal to the principal amount borrowed; (d) Ask the United States Department of Education to include all terms of PSLF in the contractual obligations of the Master Promissory Note; (e) Encourage the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) to require residency/fellowship programs to include within the te rms, conditions, and benefits of program appointment information on the employer's PSLF program qualifying status; (f) Advocate that the profit status of a physician's training institution not be a factor for PSLF eligibility; (g) Encourage medical school financial advisors to counsel wise borrowing by medical students, in the event that the PSLF program is eliminated or severely curtailed; (h) Encourage medical school financial advisors to increase medical student engagement in service- based loan repayment options, and other federal and military programs, as an attractive alternative to the PSLF in terms of financial prospects as well as providing the opportunity to provide care in medically underserved areas; (i) Strongly advocate that the terms of the PSL F that existed at the time of the agreement remain unchanged for any program participant in the event of any future restrictive changes; (j) Monitor the denial rates for physician applicants to the PSLF; (k) Undertake expanded federal advocacy, in the even t denial rates for physician applicants are unexpectedly high, to encourage release of information on the basis for the high denial rates, increased transparency and streamlining of program requirements, consistent and accurate communication between loan s ervicers and borrowers, and clear expectations regarding oversight and accountability of the loan servicers responsible for the program; (l) Work with the United States Department of Education to ensure that applicants to the PSLF and its supplemental extensions, such as Temporary Expanded Public Service Loan Forgiveness (TEPSLF), are provided with the necessary information to successfully complete the program(s) in a timely manner; and (m) Work with the United States Department of Education to ensure that individuals who would otherwise qualify for PSLF and its supplemental extensions, such as TEPSLF, are not disqualified from the program(s). 21. Advocate for continued funding of programs including Income -Driven Repayment plans for the benefit of reducing m edical student load burden. CME Rep. 06-A-23 -- page 14 of 16 22. Strongly advocate for the passage of legislation to allow medical students, residents and fellows who have education loans to qualify for interest- free deferment on their student loans while serving in a medical internship, residency, or fellowship program, as well as permitting the conversion of currently unsubsidized Stafford and Graduate Plus loans to interest free status for the duration of undergraduate and graduate medical education. H-305.988, Cost and Financing of Medical Education and Availability of First Year Residency Positions Our AMA: 1. believes that medical schools should further develop an information system based on common definitions to display the costs associated with undergraduate medical education; 2. in studying the financing of medical schools, supports identification of those elements that have implications for the supply of physicians in the future; 3. believes that the primary goal of medical school is to educate students to become physicians and that despite the economies necessary to survive in an era of decreased fundin g, teaching functions must be maintained even if other commitments need to be reduced; 4. believes that a decrease in student enrollment in medical schools may not result in proportionate reduction of expenditures by the school if quality of education is to be maintained; 5. supports continued improvement of the AMA information system on expenditures of medical students to determine which items are included, and what the ranges of costs are; 6. supports continued study of the relationship between medical student indebtedness and career choice; 7. believes medical schools should avoid counterbalancing reductions in revenues from other sources through tuition and student fee increases that compromise their ability to attract students from diverse bac kgrounds; 8. supports expansion of the number of affiliations with appropriate hospitals by institutions with accredited residency programs; 9. encourages for profit- hospitals to participate in medical education and training; 10. supports AMA monitoring of trends that may lead to a reduction in compensation and benefits provided to resident physicians; 11. encourages all sponsoring institutions to make financial information available to help residents manage their educational indebtedness; and 12. will advocate that resident and fellow trainees should not be financially responsible for their training. H-350.979, Increase the Representation of Min ority and Economically Disadvantaged Populations in the Medical Profession Our AMA supports increasing the representation of minorities in the physician population by: (1) Supporting efforts to increase the applicant pool of qualified minority students by: (a) Encouraging state and local governments to make quality elementary and secondary education opportunities available to all; (b) Urging medical schools to strengthen or initiate programs that offer special premedical a nd precollegiate experiences to underrepresented minority students; (c) urging medical schools and other health training institutions to develop new and innovative measures to recruit underrepresented minority students, and (d) Supporting legislation that provides targeted financial aid to financially disadvantaged students at both the collegiate and medical school levels. (2) Encouraging all medical schools to reaffirm the goal of increasing representation of underrepresented minorities in their student bodies and faculties. (3) Urging medical school admission committees to consider minority representation as one factor in reaching their decisions. (4) Increasing the supply of minority health professionals. CME Rep. 06-A-23 -- page 15 of 16 (5) Continuing its efforts to increase the proport ion of minorities in medical schools and medical school faculty. (6) Facilitating communication between medical school admission committees and premedical counselors concerning the relative importance of requirements, including grade point average and Medi cal College Aptitude Test scores. (7) Continuing to urge for state legislation that will provide funds for medical education both directly to medical schools and indirectly through financial support to students. (8) Continuing to provide strong support for federal legislation that provides financial assistance for able students whose financial need is such that otherwise they would be unable to attend medical school. D-295.303, Support Hybrid Interview Techniques for Entry to Graduate Medical Education Our AMA will: 1. work with relevant stakeholders to study the advantages and disadvantages of an online medical school interview option for future medical school applicants, including but not limited to financial implications and potential solutions, long term success, and well-being of students and residents. 2. enc ourage appropriate stakeholders, such as the Association of American Medical Colleges, American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine, Intealth, and Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, to study the feasibility and utility of vid eoconferencing for graduate medical education (GME) interviews and examine interviewee and program perspectives on incorporating videoconferencing as an adjunct to GME interviews, in order to guide the development of equitable protocols for expansion of hybrid GME interviews. H-255.968, Advance Tuition Payment Requirements for International Students Enrolled in US Medi cal Schools Our AMA: 1. supports the autonomy of medical schools to determine optimal tuition requirements for international students; 2. encourages medical schools and undergraduate institutions to fully inform international students interested in medical education in the US of the limited options available to them for tuition assistance; 3. supports the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) in its efforts to increase transparency in the medical school application process for international students by including school policy on tuition requirements in the Medical School Admission Requirements (MSAR); and 4. encourages medical schools to explore alternative means of prepayment, such as a letter of credit, for four years of medical school.

REPORT 07 OF THE COUNCIL ON MEDICAL EDUCATION (A -23) Management and Leadership Training in Medical Education (Reference Committee C) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY At the 2022 Annual Meeting, the A merican Medical Association (AMA) House of Delegates (HOD) adopted policy directing the AMA to \"4.(a) study the extent of the impact of AMA Policy D-295.316, ' Management and Leadership for Physicians,' on elective curriculum; and (b) expand efforts to promote the tenets of health systems science to prepare trainees for leadership roles and address prevalent challenges in the practice of medicine and public health.\" This report is written in response to these directives. While there is no clear way to study the extent of the impact of AMA policy on elective curricula, this report provides background on Policy D- 295.316, describes efforts made to advance learning opportunities regarding physician management and leadership, and discusses how this topic relates to the foundational platform of health systems science. Policy D-295.316 was originally adopted at the 2014 Interim Meeting. Since that time, it was amended at I-16 and A-18, reaffirmed at A-17, and amended at A-22 with the addition of a fourth clause, as noted above, which is the impetus for this report. Appendix A cites the various actions taken to accomplish this policy over the years. It also provides a listing of all the AMA programs, courses, and initiatives that address physician leadership and management. Further, this report describes the educational standards, competencies, and organizations that foster such knowledge and skil ls and analyzes data from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education and National GME Census related to leadership and health systems science. This report recommends that policy D-295.316 be amended to clarify the ongoing efforts of the AMA, rescind clauses accomplished by this report, and add new directives related to data collection and analysis as well as the creation of an online directory of AMA resources. \u00a9 2023 American Medical Association. All rights reserved. REPORT OF THE COUNCIL ON MEDICAL EDUCATION CME Report 07-A-23 Subject: Management and Leadership Training in Medical Education Presented by: John P. Williams, MD, Chair Referred to: Reference Committee C At the 2022 Annual Meeting, the American Medical Association (AMA) House of Delegates 1 (HOD) adopted new policy directing the AMA to: 2 3 (a) study the extent of the impact of AMA Policy D-295.316, \"Management and Leadership 4 for Physicians,\" on elective curriculum; and (b) expand efforts to promote the tenets of health 5 systems science to prepare trainees for leadership roles and address prevalent challenges in the 6 practice of medicine and public health. 7 8 Testimony on this item supported the need for physician leaders and the development of necessary 9 leadership and communication skills. This is in alignment with the AMA 's work to inculcate health 10 systems science throughout the medical education curriculum as part of its Accelerating Change in 11 Medical Education initiative (now renamed ChangeMedEd). 12 13 This report is written in response to these newly adopted directives. While there is no clear way to 14 study the extent of the impact of AMA policy on elective curricula, this report provides 15 background on Policy D-295.316, describes efforts made to advance learning opportunities 16 regarding physician management and leadership, and discusses how this topic relates to the 17 foundational platform of health systems science. 18 19 BACKGROUND 20 21 AMA Pol icy D-296.316, Management and Leadership for Physicians\" 22 23 Policy D-295.316 was originally adopted at the 2014 Interim Meeting (I-14). It was amended at I- 24 16 and A-18 and most recently at A-22 with the addition of a fourth clause, which is the impetus 25 for this report . The policy was also reaffirmed at A-17. Currently, the full policy contains four 26 clauses and reads as follows: 27 28 1. Our AMA will study advantages and disadvantages of various educational options on 29 management and leadership for physicians with a report back to the House of Delegates; and 30 develop an online report and guide aimed at physicians interested in management and 31 leadership that would include the advantages and disadvantages of various educational options. 32 2. Our AMA will work with key stakeholders to advocate for collaborative programs among 33 medical schools, residency programs, and relate d schools of business and management to better 34 CME Rep. 07-A-23 -- page 2 of 14 prepare physicians for administrative, financial and leadership responsibilities in medical 1 management. 2 3. Our AMA: (a) will advocate for and support the creation of leadership programs and curricula 3 that emphasize experiential and active learning models to include knowledge, skills and 4 management techniques integral to achieving personal and professional financial literacy and 5 leading interprofessional team care, in the spirit of the AMA's Accelerating Change in Medical 6 Education initiative; and (b) will advocate with the Liaison Committee on Medical Education, 7 Association of American Medical Colleges and other governing bodies responsible for the 8 education of future physicians to implement programs early in medical training to promote the 9 development of leadership and personal and professional financial literacy capabilities. 10 4. Our AMA will: (a) study the extent of the impact of AMA Policy D-295.316, \"Management 11 and Leadership for Physicians,\" on elective curriculum; and (b) expand efforts to promote the 12 tenets of health systems science to prepare trainees for leadership roles and address prevalent 13 challenges in the practice of medicine and public health. 14 15 From 2014-2016, AMA conducted a qualitative study and enviro nmental scan to evaluate the 16 market for physician leadership training and development and to test the potential demand for 17 AMA- led programs. As a result of this research, the AMA launched the develop ment of leadership - 18 related content for physicians specifi c to topics where the AMA has unique expertise at both the 19 individual and practice levels. Given the evolution of this policy from 2014 to 2022, several actions 20 were taken over the years to accomplish the directives in clauses (1)-(3). These actions are 21 enumerated in Appendix A and further addressed in the report's recommendations. 22 23 Educational Standards, C ompetencies, and R esources 24 25 Many organizations and institutions are responsible for the education of future physicians. They 26 may implement programs in medical training to promote the development of leadership as well as 27 personal and professional financial literacy capabilities. The Liaison Committee on Medical 28 Education (LCME) and Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), while not \"governing 29 bodies\" as stated in clause 3b of AMA policy D-295.316, do play a role. Likewise, the American 30 Osteopathic Association (AOA), Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA), 31 American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (AACOM) , and Accreditation Council 32 for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) also play important roles. 33 34 The LCME determines the standards an allopathic medical school must meet to maintain 35 accreditation. Such standards include Self-Directed and Life -Long Learning (6.3), Interprofessional 36 Collaborative Skills (7.9), and Financial Aid/Debt Management Counseling/Student Educational 37 Debt (12.1) \u2014 all of which address and support the topics raised in Policy D-295.316 clause (3a) .1 38 Similarly, COCA's standards include Curriculum Design and Management (6.1), Self-Directed 39 Learning (6.7), Interprofessional Education for Collaborative Practice (6.8), Financial Aid and 40 Debt Management Counseling (9.7), Student Debt Outcomes (11.3), and Title IV Responsibility 41 (12.9 ).2 42 43 The AAMC offers 15 competencies for entering medical students that lend themselves toward the 44 development of skills necessary for effective leadership.3 The AAMC's Group on Student Affairs 45 (GSA) supports professional development, inclusive of leadersh ip skill s, and offers a framework to 46 provide performance benchmarks.4 Further, the GSA provides various resources and a 47 downloadable, interactive catalog to identify which resources best suit the individual. For example, 48 the Leadership Education and Development (LEAD) Certificate Program is designed to foster 49 leaders in academic medicine . 50 CME Rep. 07-A-23 -- page 3 of 14 The AACOM 's Leadership Institute supports leadership development through a variety of 1 resources suitable for DOs at all career stages and pursuits, including a Senior Leadership 2 Development Program as well as a fellowship and internship in osteopathic health policy. 3 4 The ACGME Common Program Requirements, effective July 2022, establish that the 5 qualification s of a program director include leadership skills (II.A.3.a) and professionalism 6 (II.A.4.a).5 Likewise, a program coordinator should possess s kills in management and leadership . 7 The requirements acknowledge that programs may place different emphasis on some skills such as 8 leadership. The \"core competencies \" of the ACGME and American Board of Medical Specialties 9 (ABMS) provide the foundation for residency milestones as well as board certification standards 10 (initial and continuing ).6 These competencies address aspects of leadership : 11 Patient Care and Procedural Skills 12 Medical Knowledge 13 Practice -based Learning and Improvement 14 Interpersonal and Communication Skills 15 Professionalism 16 Systems -based Prac tice 17 18 DISCUSSION 19 20 Management and leadership skills are complementary and may overlap but their ultimate functions 21 differ. The concept of \"leadership\" seeks to move an organization toward achieving a strategic 22 vision though change. \"Management\" is a newer concept focused on organization al efficien cy and 23 effective ness while also addressing its complexity. In short, \" leadership can be said to craft the 24 vision and strategy , and management is necessary to operationalize .\"7 Management training usually 25 includes topics such as business/practice management, organizational skills, time, and stress 26 management; whereas leadership training often addresses such topics as communication, 27 interpersonal skills, cultural sensitivity, facilitation, problem solving, team building, and conflict 28 resolution. It is important for good leaders to understand management principles to achieve their 29 vision. Leadership will be further explored in Council on Medical Education Report 9-A-23 30 addressing accreditation standards for competency in leading interprofessional health care teams. 31 32 AMA Management and Leadership Opportunities 33 34 The AMA' s focused work in Medical Education as well as Physician Satisfaction and Practice 35 Sustainability offers a wide range of learning opportunities and resources that address the broad 36 and diverse topic of physician leadership. 37 The AMA Undergraduate Medical Education Curricular Enrichment Program (UCEP) , a 38 series of online educational modules designed to complement undergraduate medical 39 school curricula including modules on leadership. 40 The AMA Medical Student Leadership Learning Series offers interactive modules that 41 provide realistic scenarios and resources to help medical students become skilled in core 42 competencies of leadership. 43 The Succeeding in Medical School series provides medical students and internation al 44 medical graduates with medical school tips and other guidance on a wide range of critical 45 topics, including preparing for the United States Medical Licensing Examination\u00ae 46 (USMLE\u00ae), navigating clinical rotations, publishing scientific research, and maintaining 47 optimal health and wellness. It also provides opportunities for physicians to develop 48 leadership skills and advocate for patients and the profession. 49 CME Rep. 07-A-23 -- page 4 of 14 The AMA's Accelerating Change in Medical Education initiative, recently renamed 1 ChangeMedEd, works across the education continuum with visionary partners to create 2 bold innovations in undergraduate and graduate medical education. It offers transformative 3 resources for learners and educators, as well as national events that disseminate 4 innovations to better train physicians to meet the needs of patients today and in the future. 5 Members of the Accelerating Change in Medical Education Consortium actively 6 collaborate on the development of leadership curricula at the undergraduate medical 7 education level. This includes resources to address shaping tomorrow's leaders . This 8 initiative also created the Health Systems Science framework, described in more detail 9 below. 10 The AMA GME Competency Education Program (GCEP) offers a robust ser ies of online 11 educational courses that complement teachings in residency and fellowship programs with 12 meaningful, nonclinical knowledge that is easy to digest, understand, and apply. Built for 13 busy residents, fellows , and faculty, GCEP offers flexible, self-paced learning with 14 convenient anytime, anywhere access. It covers pertinent topics in GME such as resident 15 well-being, sleep deprivation, the basics of health equity, and more. This award -winning 16 program can help residents and fellows meet core program requirements and prepare for 17 practice. 18 The Reimagining Residency initiative is developing leade rship training for residents. 19 Efforts include curricula in professional identity formation. 20 The Resident Diversity Leadership Program, supported by the AMA and administered 21 through the University of Cincinnati, is a yearlong program for a cohort of 40 residents 22 from backgrounds that have been historically excluded from medicine that meets monthly 23 and works through a leadership curriculum. 24 The STEPS Forward\u00ae practice innovation strategies offer real-world solutions to the 25 challenges that physicians face every day. It provides tools to address barriers and restore 26 joy in the practice of medicine. Further, STEPS Forward\u00ae offers proven approaches on 27 how to successfully lead and manage change initiatives, empower the team , and drive 28 tangible results. It offers a toolkit of resources and information on leadership in practice 29 and a pertinent webinar entitled \"Leading Through a Crisis: Communication During 30 COVID -19 Times .\" STEPS Forward also features a module, entitled \"Cultivating 31 Leadership: Measure and Assess Leader Behaviors to Improve Professional Well -Being,\" 32 that guides learners in the importance of leadership in promoting well -being and 33 emphasizes ways to improve leadership in practice. Further, the Joy in Med icine Health 34 System Recognition program honors organizations that have d emonstrated organizational 35 investment in promoting leadership development. 36 The AMA Ed Hub online learning platform provides high- quality education for 37 physicians and other medica l professionals to stay current and continuously improve the 38 care they provide. It brings together education from trusted sources including the JAMA 39 Network and the AMA Journal of Ethics\u00ae as well as curated content from external 40 providers including access to the Stanford Leadership Virtual Journal Club . This platform 41 offers many educational opportunities (e.g., articles, podcasts, learning activities) that 42 address leadership, many of which offer CME credit. 43 The AMA Foundation 's Leadership Development Institute offers a unique opportunity for 44 physicians to gain individualized insight into the skills needed to foster their careers and 45 the future of medicine. Participants receive professional development opportunities as well 46 as mentoring throughout the course of the program. Activities include a weekend retreat, 47 monthly training webinars, a year -long formal mentorship program and culminating 48 workshops held in conjunction with the AMA Annual Meeting. 49 CME Rep. 07-A-23 -- page 5 of 14 The AMA Political Action Committee (AMPAC) is a bipartisan committee whose mission 1 is to support candidates who will help medicine in Congress. In addi tion, AMPAC offers 2 two political education training programs to encourage and support more members of the 3 medical community to either seek public office or get involved in others' political 4 campaigns. AMPAC has proudly offered these programs for over 30 ye ars and has trained 5 thousands of physicians to be successful candidates and activists. 6 The AMA's Councils recommend educational policies to the AMA House of Delegates 7 and have written many reports that discuss leadership in varying capacities. For example, 8 the Council on Medical Education offered a report on the \" The Structure and Function of 9 Interprofessional Health Care Teams \" that addresses the role of the physician leader. 10 Participation in the AMA HOD , whether as a delegate/alternate delegate, ambassador, 11 and/or member of a section, council, or board, demonstrates proactive physician 12 leadership. 13 14 This rich variety of resources is available to stud ents, trainees, physicians, and the medical 15 education community; members and institutions are encouraged to avail themselves of these 16 leadership training programs. 17 18 Health Systems Science 19 20 Health systems science (HSS) is a foundational platform and framework for understanding how 21 health care is delivered, how health care professionals work together to deliver that care , and how 22 the health system can improve patient care. 23 24 At the formation of the Accelerating Change in Medical Education initiative, the AMA called for 25 innovations in \"Promoting exemplary methods to achieve patient safety, performance improvement 26 and patient- centered team -based care; and i mproving medical students' understanding of the health 27 care system and health care financing.\"8 Member medical schools of the Accelerating Change in 28 Medical Education Consortium collaborated to create and develop a replete framework for HSS . 29 The framework rests upon systems thinking to unify domains such as leadership, teaming, change 30 agency, health care structure and processes, policies and economics, value, improvement , and 31 more. 32 33 The consortium has developed multiple resources to support faculty development and the 34 integration of training in HSS into UME and then GME. Resources include a textbook (now in its 35 second edition), online modules hosted on the AMA Ed Hub , a faculty schol ars program, and an 36 implementation guidebook. A full inventory of resources is displayed on a public landing page . 37 The AMA also hosted a Health Systems Science Summit in 2022 to promote dissemination in 38 UME and GME with over 250 participants. 39 40 A 2018 inventory of MD-granting medical schools conducted by the AMA demonstrated that most 41 schools have incorpora ted some elements of HSS, and over 50 percent use the AMA textbook as a 42 faculty resource. AMA staff and external partners continue to promote dissemination across UME 43 and GME . 44 45 Data on related curricula and training 46 47 LCME Part II Annual Medical School Ques tionnaire 48 CME Rep. 07-A-23 -- page 6 of 14 This LCME questionnaire collects data on both leadership and health systems science within the 1 medical school curriculum. The following data are from the 2021-2022 questionnaire with 2 responses from all 155 LCME -accredited medical education progra ms.9 3 4 # of schools where topics are included Topic Required course in the pre- clerkship phase (Years 1 &2) Required clerkship/ clinical discipline Leadership 103 93 Health systems science 135 120 5 National GME Census 6 7 Starting in 2019, the program survey of the National GME Census, which provides information for 8 FREIDATM, the AMA' s Residency and Fellowship Database\u00ae, asked if programs provided 9 \"Curriculum to develop health systems leadership skills (e.g., QI project leadership, 10 communit y/organizational advocacy).\" 11 12 Type of program Number and percent of programs with leadership development curriculum* 2019 - 2020 % 2020 - 2021 % 2021 - 2022 % 2022 - hospital 20.6 1593 21.3 1555 20.5 1535 20.4 Community hospital/ university affiliated 796 23.9 861 24.7 799 22.0 841 22.7 Community hospital 262 21.3 282 21.8 312 23.4 294 22.2 Other setting 14 6.0 20 8.6 16 6.8 132 35.5 Analysis of the American Medical Association 's GME Database. 13 *Programs responding affirmatively to the question \"Does the program offer... curriculum to develop health systems 14 leadership skills (e.g., QI project leadership, community/organizational advocacy\" in the National GME Census. 15 16 There does not appear to be significant growth in the number of programs providing leadership 17 training over the past four years. Residency programs appear more likely to report having the 18 curriculum compared to fellowship programs. Community -based programs are slightly more likely 19 to report having a curriculum compared to university -based programs. 20 21 Medical subspecialty proposal 22 CME Rep. 07-A-23 -- page 7 of 14 The certifying boards of multiple specialties, including the American Board of Emergency 1 Medicine (ABEM), American Board of Anesthesiology, American Board of Preve ntive Medicine, 2 and American Board of Family Medicine, recently received approval from the ABMS Committee 3 on Certification (COCERT) for a subspeci alty certification in Health Care Administration, 4 Leadership and Management (HALM). The ABEM application indicate d the purpose of the 5 proposed certification is \"to recognize expertise held by physicians with sophisticated, 6 comprehensive knowledge that cove rs the broad, system -based leadership needs of health care 7 environments, including those related to patient care as well as other health system administrative 8 and management needs. HALM integrates expertise from medicine, health systems science, quality 9 improvement, patient safety, business, public health, communication, computer science, 10 economics, law, and other disciplines in a singular subspecialty certification .\"10 The ACGME has 11 approved program requirements for GME training programs in HALM, which can have accredited 12 lengths of either 12 or 24 months. While there are not yet any accredited programs, there are 13 similar programs already in existence that are likely to seek accreditation. 14 15 RELEVANT AMA POLICIES 16 17 In addition to Policy D-295.316, the AMA has other policies related to physician leadership and 18 management as listed here. These full policies are provided in Appendix B. 19 H-235.981 , Qualifications, Selection, and Role of Medical Directors, Chief Medical 20 Officers, Vice Presidents for Medical Affairs, and Others Employed by or Under Contract 21 with Hospitals/Health Systems to Provide Medical Management Services 22 H-405.990 , Physician Managers 23 H-445.984 , Training Physicians and Physicians- in-Training in the Art of Public Speaking 24 25 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS 26 27 The AMA has made significant efforts in the last 10-plus years to address, support, and advocate 28 for physician leadership. These efforts align with the educational standards regarding leadership set 29 by the accrediting bodies and are complemented by the many partnerships that have been forged to 30 advance physician leadership. It is very difficul t to study the \"extent of the impact\" (as stated in the 31 new fourth clause of D-295.316) of a policy on elective curriculum with any degree of accuracy or 32 thoroughness given the wide scope of the resources offered, as described above. The research 33 conducted for this report indicates that the efforts made by the AMA, its partners, and other 34 external stakeholders continue to advance physician leadership by way of curricula, training 35 programs, resources, and development of a possible subspecialty. The AMA has made great strides 36 to embed leadership into the tenets of HSS to prepare trainees for leadership roles and address 37 prevalent challenges in the practice of medicine and public health. The AMA is committed to 38 continuing such efforts and promoti ng them accordingly. 39 40 The Council on Medical Education therefore recommends that the following recommendations be 41 adopted, and the remainder of this report be filed: 42 43 1. That clause (1) of AMA policy D-295.316 be rescinded as such directives have been 44 accomplished per the actions, programs, and resources summarized in this report. 45 46 1. \"Our AMA will study advantages and disadvantages of various educational options 47 on management and leadership for physicians with a report back to the House of 48 Delegates; and develop an online report and guide aimed at physicians interested in 49 management and leadership that would i nclude the advantages and disadvantages of 50 various educational options.\" (Rescind HOD Policy) 51 CME Rep. 07-A-23 -- page 8 of 14 2.

This resolve from substitute Resolution 918 was adopted in lieu of original 918 at I-14. It became the first clause of D- 295.316. 2014 -2016: Conducted qualitative study to evaluate the market for physician leadership training and development and test potential demand for an AMA -led program. Study revealed an interest for this type of curriculum, that leadership training programs already exist, and that such programs would be best delivered to medical students and residents before they start their careers. Also determined saturation of physician leadership training market from state and specialty medical associations that offer courses, regional programs (e.g., The Physician Leadership Project), physician- specific MBAs (e.g., University of Tennessee), and membership (e.g., American Association for Physician Leadership ). Conducted an environmental scan to identify physician- focused leadership programs offered through state and specialty associations. Findings noted several organizations offer leadership training, CME, conferences, programs, and other types of development for physicians. Many states partner with universities to offer programs. While there seems to be strong interest in \"physician leadership training,\" the definition and scope of this term varies. Interests range from mentoring, coaching, webinars, and CME Rep. 07-A-23 -- page 10 of 14 certif icate programs to an MBA. Likewise, topical interests range from traditional leadership topics such as management to broader issues around finance, revenue cycle, and quality outcomes. As a result of this research, AMA to develop leadership -related content for physicians specific to topics where the AMA has unique expertise at both at the individual and practice levels. In 2015, partnered with the American Association for Physician Leadership (AAPL) in a joint leadership initiative to develop multiple leadership courses and organize a large conference in early 2016. Registration for the conference was extremely low, and the event was cancelled. The partnership with AAPL was discontinued. 2. \"Our AMA will work with key stakeholders to advocate for collaborative programs among medical schools, residency programs, and related schools of business and management to better prepare physicians for administrative , financial and leadership responsib ilities in medical management.\" Adopted at I-14 and amended at A-18.

In 2014, AMA contacted the AAMC, AOA, and AACOM to inform them of the new policy. It was also transmitted to each medical school, residency program director, directors of medical education at U.S. teaching hospitals , and other interested groups via the AMA MedEd Update e- newsletter. Further, the AMA Section on Medical Schools (now called the Academic Physician Section) was encouraged to advocate on behalf of the issue. 3a. \"Our AMA will advocate for and support the creation of leadership programs and curricula that emphasize experiential and active learning models to include knowledge, skills and management techniques integral to achieving personal and professional finan cial This clause from substitute resolution 306 was adopted in lieu of original 306 at I-16, and subsequently appended to D- 295.316 as clause 3a.

Our AMA supports the following guidelines regarding the qualifications and selection of individuals employed by or under contra ct with a hospital/health system to provide medical management services, such as medical directors, chief medical officers, and vice presidents for medical affairs: a. The hospital governing body, management, and medical staff should jointly: (i) determine if there is a need to employ or contract with one or more individuals to provide medical management services; (ii) establish the purpose, duties, and responsibilities of these positions; (iii) establish the qualifications for these positions; and (iv) establish and sustain a mechanism for input from and participation by elected leaders of the medical staff in the selection, evaluation, and termination of individuals holding these positions. b. An individual employed by or under contract with a hospital or health system to provide medical management services should be a physician (MD/DO). c. A physician providing medical management services at a single hospital should be licensed to practice medicine in the same state as the hospital for which he or she provides such services. Additionally, he or she should be a member in good standing of the organized medical staff of the hospital for which he or she provides medical management services. d. Where f easible, a physician providing medical management services at the system level for a multi-hospital health system should be licensed to practice medicine in each of the states in which the health system has a hospital that will be influenced by the physician's work. At a minimum, the physician should be licensed in at least one state in which the health system has a hospital over which the physician will exert influence, and in as many other states as may be required by state licensing law. e. Where feasible, a physician providing medical management services at the s ystem level for a multi-hospital health system should be a member in good standing of the medical staff of each of the hospitals that will be influenced by the physician's work. At a minimum, the physician should: (i) be a member in good standing of at least one of the medical staffs of the hospitals that will be influenced by the physician's work; and (ii) work in collaboration with elected medical staff leaders throughout the system and with any individuals who provide medical management services at the hospital level. 2. Our AMA supports the following guidelines regarding the role of the organized medical staff vis-a-vis individuals employed by or under contract with hospitals/health systems to provide medical management services: a. The purpose, duties, and responsibilities of individuals employed by or under contract with the hospital/health system to provide medical management services should be included in the medical staff bylaws and in the hospital/health system corporate bylaws. b. The organized medical staff should maintain overall responsibility for the quality of care provided to patients by the hospital, including the quality of the professional services provided by individuals with clinical privileges, and should have the responsibility of reporting to the governing body. c. The chief elected officer of the medical staff should represent the medical staff to the administration, governing body, and external agencies. d. Government regulations that would mandate that any individual not elected or appointed by the medical staff would have authority over the medical staff should be opposed. CME Rep. 07-A-23 -- page 13 of 14 H-405.990, Physician Managers The AMA advocates (1) compiling and making available to interested medical students, residents, and practicing physicians information on management career opportunities and educational programs; (2) liaison activities with recognized na tional organizations that represent the interests of physician managers, and (3) continued efforts to collect and disseminate relevant and useful data pertaining to physician managers. H-445.984, Training Physicians and Physicians -in-Training in the Art of Public Speaking H- 445.984 1. Physicians who want to learn more about public speaking can leverage existing resources both within and outside the AMA. AMA can make public speaking tips available through online tools and resources that would be publicized on our website. Physicians and physicians- in-training who want to publicly com municate about the AMA' s ongoing work are invited to learn more through the AMA Ambassador program. Meanwhile, STEPS Forward provides helpful tips to physicians and physicians -in-training wanting to improve communication within their practice and AMPAC is available for physicians and physicians- in-training who want to advocate and communicate about the needs of patients, physicians, and physicians- in-training in the pursuit of public office. There are also resources provided to physicians and physicians- in-training at various Federation organizations and through the American Association of Physician Leadership (AAPL) to support those who are interested in training of this nature. Because public speaking is a skill that is best learned through practice and coaching in a small group or one-on-one setting, we also encourage individuals to pursue training through their state or specialty medical society or through a local chapter of Toastmasters International. The Board of Trustees r ecommends that the AMA' s Enter prise Communications and Marketing department work to develop online tools and resources that would be published on the AMA website to help physicians and physicians- in-training learn more about public speaking. 2. Our AMA will offer live education session s at least annually for AMA members to develop their public speaking skills.

REPORT OF THE COUNCIL ON MEDICAL EDUCATION CME Report 08- A-23 Subject: Challenges to Primary Source Verification of International Medical Graduates Resulting from International Conflict Presented by: John P. Williams , MD, Chair Referred to: Reference Committee C American Medical Association (AMA) Policy D -255.975, \"Hardship for International Medical 1 Graduates from Russia and Belarus,\" calls for the following action: 2 3 \"Our AMA will study the impact of the current political crisis on international medical 4 graduates with medical degrees from Russia and Belarus who are already in the U.S. either in 5 training or practicing in regards to their ability to obtain primary source verification and report 6 back during the 2022 Interim House of Delegates meeting.\" 7 8 The resolution that led to the policy was adopted at the 2022 Annual Meeting of the AMA House 9 of Delegates (HOD). This report is in response to that policy. 10 11 BACKGROUND 12 13 Russia, with the support of Belarus, invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022. This action 14 precipitated sanctions of the invading countries by the international community , including the U.S., 15 which significantly reduced communication to and from organizations in Belarus and Russia, to 16 include postal mail, internet, and receipt and origination of electronic payments. These gaps in 17 communications may affect international medical graduates (IMGs) in the U.S. who completed 18 medical school in Russia or Belarus, and who may require primary source verification for purposes 19 of obtaining licensure or credentialing. 20 21 One of the key organizations involved in such verification and assistance of IMGs is the 22 Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG), a member of Intealth , an 23 integrated organization that also includes the Foundation for A dvancement of International Medical 24 Education and Research (FAIMERTM). Certification by ECFMG is the standard for evaluating the 25 qualifications of these physicians before they enter U.S. graduate medical education (GME). 26 ECFMG Certification also is a requi rement for IMGs to take Step 3 of the three- step United States 27 Medical Licensing Examination\u00ae (USMLE\u00ae) and to obtain an unrestricted license to practice 28 medicine in the United States. 29 30 The ECFMG provides other programs for IMGs pursuing U.S. GME, including those that 1) assist 31 them with the process of applying for U.S. GME positions and 2) sponsor foreign nationals for the 32 J-1 visa for the purpose of participating in such programs. The ECFMG also offers a verification 33 service that allows GME programs, state medical boards, hospitals, and credentialing agencies in 34 the United States to obtain primary -source confirmation that their IMG applicants are ECFMG - 35 certified.1 36 CME Rep. 08- A-23 -- page 2 of 7 A little over a month after the invasion, on March 31, 2022, the ECFMG announced that it was 1 pausing certification services requested by Russian citizens residing in Russia.2 The ECFMG 2 statement reflected concern for the health and safety of all medical school students and graduates as 3 they pursue their medical education and training. The statement also noted that 30 Russian 4 physicians and 10 Ukrainian physicians were selected in the 2022 Match for positions in U.S. 5 training programs ; ECFMG noted that it would do its best to assist those seeking J -1 visas . 6 7 RELEVANT AMA POLICIES 8 9 The AMA has a number of policies reflecting support for IMGs and their significant role in 10 providing health care services in the U.S., as highlighted in the appendix. That said, AMA policy 11 does not specifically address the issue of physicians in the U.S. w ho are from countries that are 12 sanctioned by the international community and the resulting impact on primary source verification 13 of their medical education for the purposes of licensure, certification, and credentialing. 14 15 Existing policy D-275.989, \"Crede ntialing Issues,\" asks that the AMA encourage \"state medical 16 licensing boards, the Federation of State Medical Boards, and other credentialing entities to accept 17 the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates certification as proof of primary 18 source verification of an IMG's international medical education credentials.\" If credentialing 19 organizations follow this recommendation, that obviate s the need for communication to foreign 20 schools or government agencies to obtain the requested documentation. 21 22 RELEVANT POLICY FROM THE WORLD MEDICAL ASSOCIATION 23 24 Founded in 1947, the World Medical Association (WMA ) is a non -governmental, not -for-profit 25 voluntary organization representing 9 million physicians from 115 national medical associations. 26 The WMA's areas of interest comprise ethical, educational, social, public health, and medical 27 practice concerns, among others . The AMA has a delegation to the WMA and is involved in 28 proposing and revising WMA policie s, which help inform global health policy.3 29 30 A recent search of WMA policy found nothing that specifically mention s primary source 31 verification or support for IMGs from Russia and Belarus. The policy \" Ethical Guidelines for the 32 International Migration of Health Workers \"4 includes the following recom mendations: 33 34 5) Physicians should not be prevented from leaving their home or adopted country to pursue 35 career opportunities in another country. 36 37 8) Nothing should prevent countries from entering into bilateral agreements and agreements 38 of understanding, a s provided for in international law and with due cognizance of international 39 human rights law, so as to effect meaningful co- operation on health care delivery, including the 40 exchange of physicians. 41 42 The above policy also underscores the World Health Organi zation (WHO) Global Code of Practice 43 on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel ,5 which specifies ethical and equitable 44 recruitment principles, but again no specific mention is made of primary source verification or 45 challenges to such recruitmen t and verification of credentials in the case of war and/or conflict. 46 47 Other tangentially relevant WMA policies include two resolution s (both adopted in October 2022) 48 on humanitarian and medical aid6 and support for medical personnel and citizens7 that specifically 49 mention the Russian invasion and the resulting impact on Ukraine . 50 CME Rep. 08- A-23 -- page 3 of 7 DISCUSSION 1 2 Policy D -255.975 stipulates the study of IMGs \"with medical degrees from Russia and Belarus 3 who are already in the U.S. either in training or practicing\" in regard to concerns for primary 4 source verification of their education. The ECFMG statement, in contrast, specificall y paused 5 certification services requested by Russian citizens residing in Russia (not Belarus) \u2014it was not 6 directed at those Russian citizens already in the U.S., as described in the resolution. 7 8 In the case of the invasion of Ukraine, damages to and inter ruptions of the country's technological 9 infrastructure would seem to present even greater challenges to the provision of needed documents 10 to the U.S. than those of Russia and Belarus. The resolution does not mention this aspect. 11 12 It is important to note that, if a physician is already in GME, that individual is primary source 13 verified, as such verification is a requirement for entry to GME (personal communication with 14 senior ECFMG staff , February 7, 2023). Even t hose IMGs arriving this year to commence GME 15 are likely to have already had their documents verified when they started the certification process 16 (which typically takes place over a three -year period ). In other words, the impact on credentials 17 verification arising fr om any international conflict or cessation of diplomatic relations between the 18 U.S. and another country is delayed, so if the situation continues past three years, the negative 19 impacts to primary source verification rise. 20 21 ECFMG staff also indicated that the EC FMG pursues alternative options if the customary primary 22 source verification process is not workable \u2014for example, when there is international conflict or 23 the medical school or ministry of health in a given country is not responding to ECFMG queries . 24 Through one alternative option, the applicant for ECFMG certification can request that three 25 medical school classmates or faculty who are now practicing in the U.S. swear on their U .S. 26 medical license that the a pplicant did indeed graduate . This process requires completion of a 27 notarized form and submission of a letter describing the facts of the matter . The ECFMG tries to 28 assist individual applicants throughout the certification process (while maintaining the in tegrity of 29 its procedures ), to include postponement of examinations and refunding fees, where appropriate. 30 31 Because of the relatively low number of IMGs currently in U.S. GME programs from Russia, 32 Belarus, and Ukraine \u2014217, 36, and 115, respectively, accor ding to 2022 data from the AMA GME 33 Database\u2014 the extent of the impact of the Ukraine conflict on primary source verification is limited 34 in scope . ECFMG staff noted that, f rom a historical perspective, the cessation of communication 35 from Russia to any U.S. agency during the 1990s, the embargo with Cuba, and the Gulf wars in 36 Iraq and Iran presented significantly greater difficulties to obtaining primary source verification of 37 medical education . Nonetheless, due to the history of challenges associated with primary source 38 verification for IMGs, the Council on Medical Education\u2014with input from the IMG Section \u2014will 39 regularly engage with the ECFMG to monitor the impact of conflicts on primary source 40 verification of medical education and report back to the HOD as needed. 41 42 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS 43 44 Even aside from international conflict and war , and public health disruptions such as the COVID- 45 19 pandemic , there are many challenges to primary source verification of IMGs. Despite the 46 internet and email technologies, the obstacles of international communication and retention of 47 appropriate educational records by countries of origin continue to present difficulties for IMGs. 48 The cessation of international bank payments and transfers, due to sanctions put in place by the 49 international community in response to the invasion, can also hinder requests for primary source 50 documentation. 51 CME Rep. 08-A-23 -- page 4 of 7 The impacts of the war in Ukraine on primary source verification of physicians from Russia and 1 Belarus have been relatively limited \u2014in part due to the small number of IMGs in the U.S. from 2 those countries. In addition, the ECFMG has been responsive to the situation and has in place 3 multiple alternative methods for verifying an IMG's medical education credentials. That said, the 4 Council on Medical Education will continue to monitor th is situation, as well as other conflicts or 5 wars that may delay primary source verification of IMGs' medical education, and report back to 6 the HOD as needed. 7 8 As noted above, e xisting AMA policy D-275.989, \"Credentialing Issues,\" is the most relevant 9 policy to the question posed by the resolution and is therefore recommended for reaffirmation 10 through this report. Widespread acceptance by credentialing agencies of ECFMG certification 11 would provide relief to ECGMG -certified IMGs from any country as they seek initial or renewed 12 medical certification, licensure, or credentials in the U.S. 13 14 The Council on Medical Education therefore recommends that the following recommendations be 15 adopted and the remainder of this report be filed: 16 17 1. That American Medical Association (AMA) Policy D- 275.989, \"Credentialing Issues ,\" be 18 amended as follows: 19 20 Our AMA encourages state medical licensing boards, the Federation of State Medical 21 Boards, and other credentialing entities to accept the Educational Commi ssion for Foreign 22 Medical Graduates certification by the E ducational C omm ission for Foreign M edical 23 Graduates (a member of Intealth) as proof of primary source verification of an IMG's 24 international medical education credentials. (Modify Current HOD Policy) 25 26 2. That AMA Policy D -255.975, \"Hardship for International Medical Graduates from Russia 27 and Belarus,\" be rescinded, as having been fulfilled by this report: 28 29 \"Our AMA will study the impact of the current political crisis on international medical 30 graduates with medical degrees from Russia and Belarus who are already in the U.S. either 31 in training or practicing in regards to their ability to obtain primary source verification and 32 report back during the 2022 Interim House of Delegates meeting.\" ( Rescind HOD Policy) 33 Fiscal note: $1,000.

REPORT 09 OF THE COUNCIL ON MEDICAL EDUCATION (A -23) The Impact of Midlevel Providers on Medical Education (Resolution 201 -A-22) (Reference Committee C) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Resolution 201- A-22, \"The Impact of Midlevel Providers on Medical Education,\" was authored by the American Medical Association (AMA) Resident and Fellow Section and submitted to the 2022 Annual Meeting of the House of Delegates (HOD). The resolution, which was subsequently referred by the HOD, requests that the AMA conduct several studies related to the education of physicians in interprofessional teams and the training and continuing education requirements of nurse practitioners and physician assistants. This report, which is in response to the referral, addresses the multiple facets of the resolution, to include the challenges in studying bias in interprofessional education and developing a rigorous, statistically valid, and high -quality study suitable f or publication by a peer -reviewed journal. This report concludes that such research is beyond the scope of the AMA, although the AMA can encourage investigators to study how interprofessional learning and team -building work promotes the development of phys ician leadership in team -based care. This report describes the growth in team -based care and widespread adoption of the physician- led team as the preferred model for high- quality health care, underscoring the need for incorporating interprofessional princ iples into medical education and training. In addition, existing medical education accreditation standards related to interprofessional education in undergraduate and graduate medical education are highlighted . The report recommends that t hese standards be expanded and strengthened to state that physicians' education and training make them uniquely qualified to lead the health care team, as reflected in AMA policy. In addition, this report notes that the AMA does not directly oversee the education and training of nonphysician health care professionals, which makes adoption of Resolves 3 and 4 of the referred resolution neither feasible nor enforceable. Relevant AMA policies are high lighted (and noted in the appendix). In particular , H-160.912, \"The Structure and Function of Interprofessional Health Care Teams,\" provides a road map to the appropriate interprofessional education of medical students and resident/fellow physicians to take on the pivotal responsibility of leadership of the interprofessional health care team. \u00a9 2023 American Medical Association.

Williams , MD, Chair Referred to: Reference Committee C Resolution 201- A-22, \" The Impact of Midlevel Providers on Medical Educatio n,\" was authored by 1 the American Medical Association (AMA) Resident and Fellow Section and submitted to the 2022 2 Annual Meeting of the House of Delegates (HOD). The resolution reads as follows: 3 4 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association study , using surveys among other 5 tools that protect identities, how commonly bias against physician- led healthcare is 6 experienced within undergraduate medical education and graduate medical education, 7 interprofessional learning and team building work and publis h these findings in peer - 8 reviewed journals (Directive to Take Action); and be it further 9 10 RESOLVED, That our AMA work with the Liaison Committee on Medical Education and 11 the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education to ensure all physician 12 under graduate and graduate training programs recognize and teach physicians that they are 13 the leaders of the healthcare team and are adequately equipped to diagnose and treat 14 patients independently only because of the intensive, regulated, and standardized educ ation 15 they receive (Directive to Take Action); and be it further 16 17 RESOLVED, That our AMA study the harms and benefits of establishing mandatory 18 postgraduate clinical training for nurse practitioners and physician assistants prior to 19 working within a specia lty or subspecialty field (Directive to Take Action); and be it 20 further 21 22 RESOLVED, That our AMA study the harms and benefits of establishing national 23 requirements for structured and regulated continued education for nurse practitioners and 24 physician assist ants in order to maintain licensure to practice. (Directive to Take Action) 25 26 The resolution was subsequently referred by the HOD for a report back the House; this report is in 27 response to the referral. 28 29 BACKGROUND 30 31 Concerns expressed by the resolution's authors 32 33 The resolution stipulate s concerns with interprofessional education as well as the training and 34 practice of nonphysicians. For example, the authors claim that physicians are being reprimanded or 35 fired for spe aking out about discrepancies between physician and nonphysician training. In 36 addition, concern is expressed about the growth in the number of graduate -level training programs 37 for nonphysicians, even though they are not required to pursue such training, as well as the lack of 38 CME Rep. 09-A-23 -- page 2 of 17 any requirement for equivalent continuing education by nonphysicians, versus the need for 1 physicians to pursue such education to maintain board certification, state licensure, and often 2 hospital credentials. Finally, the resolution not es that midlevel providers are free to move between 3 various fields of medicine without any formal, regulated training or education, but physicians are 4 limited to the scope of their specialty of medicine by credentialing and board certification . 5 6 Note: T he term \"advanced practice providers, \" including but not limited to nurse practitioners 7 (NPs) and physician assistants (PAs), is often used instead of \"midlevel providers.\" This report is 8 primarily concerned with these two fields. 9 10 Reference Committee C test imony on the resolution 11 12 The report of Reference Committee B at the 2022 Annual Meeting reflected the mixed testimony 13 on this item of business , including input from multiple specialties . Testimony highlighted that the 14 AMA has extensive policy on scope of practice, including support for physician- led team -based 15 care, as well as policy that medical education should prepare students to practice in physician-led 16 teams and that physician-led interprofessional education should be incorporated into medical 17 educat ion and residency programs. Support was also expressed for interprofessional collaboration 18 and the role of nonphysicians as important members of the care team. General support was heard 19 for further studies about scope of practice, but testimony did note th at the AMA already has 20 extensive information and existing resources outlining the differences in graduate education and 21 training of nonphysicians versus physicians. It was also noted that the directives in Resolution 201 22 were not feasible or could be costl y to implement . In addition, the AMA does not have direct 23 authority over graduate clinical training or continuing education requirements for nonphysicians. 24 These requirements are set by each health profession's accrediting , certifying, and licensing bodies, 25 who may not align themselves with AMA policies . For these reasons, the resolution was 26 recommended for referral by Reference C ommittee C; the HOD concurred with this decision. 27 28 Council on Medical Education testimony on the resolution 29 30 In its testimony before Reference Committee B, the AMA Council on Medical Education stated its 31 opposition to adoption of Resolution 201-A-22, noting the lack of feasibility of perform ing a study 32 regarding bias against physician- led teams in medical education and practice. In addition, the 33 Council noted that having such a study accepted and published in a peer- reviewed journal is 34 outside the AMA's purview and control. Similarly , the AMA has no authority over the education or 35 licensure of other health care pr ofessionals, such that study of the education of these professionals, 36 as requested in the third and fourth resolved clauses , would be difficult to accomplish and the 37 recommendations from such a study are unlikely to be adopted by the affected professions. Finally, 38 the Council noted that its Report 5-A-22, \" Education, Training, and Credentialing Of Non- 39 Physician Health Care Professionals and Their Impact on Physician Education and Training 40 (Resolution 305-J-21, Resolve 8) ,\" addressed some of the issues outlined in Resolution 201-A-22. 41 This report led to AMA policy regarding learning about educational differences between 42 physicians and nonphysician health care professionals as well as supporting institutional oversight 43 of training programs of nonphysicians and their impact on medical education. 44 45 DISCUSSION 46 47 Difficulty in fielding a study of bias in interprofessional education 48 49 Resolve 1 of the referred resolution asks that the AMA \"study, using surveys among other tools 50 that protect identities, how commonly bias against physician -led healthcare is experienced within 51 CME Rep. 09-A-23 -- page 3 of 17 undergraduate medical education and graduate medical education, interprofessional learning and 1 team building work and publish these findings in peer- reviewed journals .\" Investigators studying 2 this issue would first need to perform qualitative analy ses of episodes of interprofessional learning 3 and team building work in medical education settings to describe the degree and nature of bias 4 against physician- led health care , if any. These findings would then inform surveys of medical 5 students and resident/fellow physicians of their experience with interprofessional learning and 6 team building work to determine the scope of the biases described by the qualitative research. 7 Investigators would require financial support to perform rigorous, statistically vali d, high -quality 8 studies that would be accepted for publication by peer- reviewed journals. This research is beyond 9 the scope of the AMA; however, the AMA can encourage investigators to study how 10 interprofessional learning and team building work promotes the development of physician 11 leadership in team -based care. 12 13 \"Team sport:\" The rise of the health care team 14 15 Since World War II, medicine has seen the rapid development of new diagnostic , therapeutic, and 16 procedural techniques to improve the qual ity of patient care . Similarly, medicine has recognized 17 other factors influencing health outcomes , including population health,1 structural and social 18 determinants of health,2 and other key domains of health systems scien ce.3 To address both the 19 rapid growth in medical science and technology and increased complexity of delivering high quality 20 health care , medicine has become increasing ly specialized ,4 with concordant expansion of 21 nonphysician members of the health care team. Accordingly, as team leader, the physician must 22 understand the appropriate role of each team member and ensure appropriate communication and 23 coordination of care for the patient's benefit .5 Hospitals, academic practices, and health care 24 systems have increasin gly adopted the physician- led team as the preferred model for high-quality 25 health care , highlighting the need for i ncorporating these principles into medical education and 26 training. 27 28 As physicians became increasingly specialized , PA and NP programs were established in the 1960s, 29 followed by the founding of the American Board of Family Medicine in 1969, to address the 30 workforce shortage in primary care. In addition, with the advances in the care of acute health 31 conditions, chronic disease man agement and the \"new morbidit ies,\" 6 conditions aris ing from 32 social , behavioral , and developmental issues , began to dominate medical practice, demanding 33 multi- disciplinary teams to deliver high-quality care . Research on high-performing primary care 34 showed that access to primary care improv ed health outcomes , lowered health care spending , and 35 decreased health disparities.7 The benefits of high- performing primary care depend on patients 36 having a trusted , continuous relationship with a personal primar y care physician who leads and 37 coordinates the patien ts' health care team , also referred to as the medical home as defined in policy 38 H-160.919 , \"Principles of the Patient -Centered Medical Home .\" 39 40 Central to achiev ing optimal health outcomes is the need to define the role of the physician in 41 team -based care as the leader of the health care team . Because of the longer, more intensive 42 education and evaluation requirements in the medical profession compared to other health care 43 fields, a physician is the most qualified health professional to lead the care team in education and 44 practice. The AMA has extensive policy supporting physician -led team -based care and believes it 45 is appropriate to reinforce this concept within medical education , through which the privilege of 46 leadership is earned . In addition , the AMA's ChangeMedEd initiative provides a real -life 47 laboratory for investigation of educational approaches to teach the primacy of the physician-led 48 team in medical education as the optimal model for ensuring quality of patient care. 49 CME Rep. 09- A-23 -- page 4 of 17 Medical education accreditati on standards related to interprofessional education 1 2 To ensure the quality of medical education and to implement recommend ed educational revisions in 3 response to the needs of medical students and resident/fellow physicians , as well as societ y and 4 patient s, is a key role of accrediting bodies, including the Liaison Committee on Medical Education 5 (LCME) and Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME ) in undergraduate 6 and graduate medical education, respectively. Resolve 2 of the referred resolution asks the AMA to 7 \"work with the Liaison Committee on Medical Education and the Accreditation Council for 8 Graduate Medical Education to ensure all physician undergraduate and graduate training programs 9 recognize and teach physicians that they are the leaders of the healthcare team and are adequately 10 equipped to diagnose and treat patients independently only because of the intensive, regulated, and 11 standardized education they receive.\" I nterprofessional education and practice are intended to 12 ensure that all members of the team learn to practice as part of a physician- led health care team. 13 14 Physicians , as team leaders, need to understand other members of the health care team 's roles as 15 well as their differences in education and training . Medical education should include knowledge of 16 the differences in the education and professional standards of other health professionals in the 17 health care team. 18 19 Current LCME and ACGME accreditation standards support interprofessional education. LCME 20 standards8 include two pertinent elements: 21 22 6.7 Academic Environments 23 24 The faculty of a medical school ensure that medical students have opportunities to learn in 25 acade mic environments that permit interaction with students enrolled in other health 26 professions, graduate and professional degree programs, and in clinical environments that 27 provide opportunities for interaction with physicians in graduate medical education 28 programs and in continuing medical education programs. 29 30 7.9 Interprofessional Collaborative Skills 31 32 The faculty of a medical school ensure that the core curriculum of the medical education 33 program prepares medical students to function collaboratively on health care teams that 34 include health professionals from other disciplines as they provide coordinated services to 35 patients. These curricular experiences include practitioners and/or students from the other 36 health professions. 37 38 The ACGME Common Program R equirements9 contain multiple references to interprofessional 39 education: 40 41 Residents must demonstrate competence in . . . working in interprofessional teams to 42 enhance patient safety and improve patient care quality; 43 44 The program must have a structure that promotes safe, interprofessional, team -based care 45 46 Optimal patient safety occurs in the setting of a coordinated interprofessional learning and 47 working environment. 48 CME Rep. 09- A-23 -- page 5 of 17 Residents must participate as team members in real and/or simulated interprofessional 1 clinical patient safety activities, such as root cause analyses or other activities that include 2 analysis, as well as formulation and implementation of actions 3 4 Residents must have the opportunity to participate in interprofessional quality improvement 5 activities 6 7 Residents must care for patients in an environment that maximizes communication. This 8 must include the opportunity to work as a member of effective interprofessi onal teams that 9 are appropriate to the delivery of care in the specialty and larger health system. 10 11 Both sets of standards help underscore that interprofessional education is a priority in medical 12 education. That said, these standards could be expanded and strengthened to state that physicians ' 13 education and training make them uniquely qualified to lead the health care team , as reflected in 14 AMA policy . In addition, it would be within the scope of the AMA to advocate for insertion of 15 qualifying modifiers in these standards where warranted \u2014for example, inclusion of the phrase 16 \"physician- led\" to modify \" interprofessional teams.\" This report includes a recommendation to that 17 effect. Personal communication with LCME staff indicates that this change would be appro priate. 18 19 While interprofessional education is important, residency programs and their sponsoring institutions 20 need to ensure that the presence of other health professionals in the clinical setting does not 21 negatively impact resident education, including ensuring that residents have the appropriate 22 responsibility for patient care, case number s, and case mix to prepare them for independent 23 practice. The ACGME's Common Program Requirements state, in this regard, that \" The presence 24 of other learner s and other care providers, including, but not limited to, residents from other 25 programs, subspecialty fellows, and advanced practice providers, must enrich the appointed 26 residents' education. \"10 This concept is reflected in Policy H -310.913, \"Physician Extenders ,\" 27 which notes in part that \" procedural training is a critical portion of resident education and the 28 augmentation of patient care by nonphysician practitioners should not interfere with a resident's 29 ability to achieve competence in the performance o f required procedure s.\" 30 31 Education and training of other health professionals 32 33 The AMA does not directly oversee the education and training of nonphysician health care 34 professionals. For several decades, beginning in the 1930s, t he Council on Medical Education did 35 have oversight over accreditation of a significant number of allied health education programs 36 including physician assistant s through its Committee on Allied Health Education and Accreditation, 37 or CAHEA. By the early to mid -1990s, t hat work was seen as outside the scope of the AMA and 38 ceased , leading to development of the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education 39 Programs and other accreditation bodies to continue this essential role. 40 41 Despite this lack of direct oversight , the AMA can call on standard- setting organizations, such as 42 the American Board of Medical Specialties, to play a more active role in communicating with 43 policymakers the standards to which physici ans are held , including maintenance of certification, 44 and why these standards serve as the basis for physician leadership of the health care team . 45 46 Resolves 3 and 4 of the referred resolution encompass AMA study of establishing \"mandatory 47 postgraduate clin ical training for nurse practitioners and physician assistants prior to working 48 within a specialty or subspecialty field\" and \"national requirements for structured and regulated 49 continued education for nurse practitioners and physician assistants in order to maintain licensure to 50 practice.\" 51 CME Rep. 09- A-23 -- page 6 of 17 For NPs, five different certifying bodies offer 19 different certificat es in various fields of 1 medicine.11 Certification is required to obtain state licensure for practice as an NP. Similarly, PAs 2 seeking to practice must obtain the PA -C certification. In addition, the National Commission on 3 Certification of Physician Assistants currently offers 10 certificates of added qualifications (CAQs) 4 in various fields (the CAQ is a voluntary credential and does not replace PA -C certification) .12 To 5 obtain one of these CAQs, a PA -C must have between 2 to 4 years of experience in the field. Since 6 2011, nearly 2,800 PA -Cs have earned CAQs in seven different specialties. 7 8 In summary , the third and fourth Resolves of the referred resolution are neither feasible nor 9 enforceable as our AMA does not have the authority or purview over post -graduate clinical training 10 or continuing education requirements for nonphysicians. These requirements are set by the 11 individual profession's accrediting, certifying, and licensing bodies. In addition, the AMA does not 12 have the ability to conduct a study on harms and benefits of additional training and certification 13 requirements for NPs and PAs to work as licensed professionals. 14 15 RELEVANT AMA POLICY 16 17 The AMA has several policies in support of interprofessional education. For example, Policy D - 18 295.934, \"Encouragement of Interprofessional Education Among Health Care Professions 19 Students,\" specifies the phrase \"physician- led\" in its verbiage: 20 21 2. Our AMA supports the concept that medical education should prepare students for practice 22 in physician- led interprofessional teams. 23 24 In addition, the policy (most recently amended via Council on Medical Education Report 5- A-22) 25 includes language that encompasses the spirit of and obviates the need for Resolve 3 of Resolution 26 201-A-22: 27 28 Our AMA supports a clear mechanism for medical school and appropriate institutional leaders 29 to intervene when undergraduate and graduate medical education is being adversely impacted 30 by undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate clinical training programs of non- physicians. 31 32 Other relevant policies are noted in the appendix, to include H -160.912, \"The Structure and 33 Function of Interprofessional Health Care Teams,\" which uses the term \"physician -led\" in three of 34 its six clauses. Indeed, this policy provides a road map to the appropriate interprofessional 35 education of medical students and resident/fellow physicians to take on the pivotal responsibility of 36 leadership : 37 38 4. Our AMA adopts the following principles to guide physician leaders of health care teams: 39 a. Focus the team on patient and family- centered care. 40 b. Make clear the team's mission, vision and values. 41 c. Direct and/or engage in collaboration with team members on patient care. 42 d. Be accountable for clinical care, quality improvement, efficiency of care, and continuing 43 education. 44 e. Foster a respectful team culture and encourage team members to contribute the full 45 extent of their professional insights, information and resources. 46 f. Encourage adherence to best practice protocols that team members are expected to 47 follow. 48 g. Manage care transitions by the team so that they are efficient and effective, and 49 transparent to the patient and family. 50 CME Rep. 09- A-23 -- page 7 of 17 h. Promote clinical collaboration, coordination, and communication within the team to 1 ensure efficient, quality care is provided to the patient and that knowledge and expertise 2 from team members is shared and utilized. 3 i. Support open communication among and between the patient and family and the team 4 members to enhance quality patient care and to define the roles and responsibilities of the 5 team members that they encounte r within the specific team, group , or network. 6 j. Facilitate the work of the team and be responsible for reviewing team members ' clinical 7 work and documentation. 8 k. Review measures of ' population health' periodically when the team is responsible for the 9 care of a defined group. 10 11 It should also be noted that e xisting AMA policy supports advocacy and action to allow for 12 appropriate intervention when undergraduate and graduate medical education are adversely 13 affected by undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduat e clinical training programs for nonphysicians 14 (as stated in Policy D -295.934 (6), \"Encouragement of Interprofessional Education Among Health 15 Care Professions Students,\" which resulted from CME Report 5 -A-22). 16 17 In short, the AMA has clear and extensive pol icy supporting physician- led team -based care, as well as 18 policy that medical education should prepare students to practice in physician- led teams and that 19 physician- led interprofessional education should be incorporated into medical education and residency 20 programs. Our AMA also supports interprofessional collaboration and the unique skills all health care 21 professionals bring to the health care team. 22 23 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS 24 25 Resolution 201- A-22 requests that the AMA conduct several studies related to the education of 26 physicians in interprofessional teams and the training and continuing education requirements of 27 nurse practitioners and physician assistants. T he Council on Medical Education would note that to 28 perform the requested investigations such that they meet the standard for peer-reviewed publication 29 would involve significant effort and resources that are beyond the scope of the AMA . While the 30 finding s from such research could inform policymakers , it shoul d be noted that the AMA does not 31 have direct oversight over nonphysician education, training, and practice to directly implement 32 changes based on such research . 33 34 Reinforcing the principle that inte rprofessional teams in education and practice are led by 35 physicians is within the scope of the AMA and is a key element of its work to protect patients . 36 A number of AMA policies encompass interprofessional education , such as D -295.934, 37 \"Encouragement of Interprofessional Education Among Health Care Professions Student s,\" and 38 provide the policy basis for the AMA to advocate for the physician as the leader of the health care 39 team. In addition, t he AMA, t hrough its Advocacy unit , plays an active and essential role in 40 preventing inappropriate expansion of practice a mong nonphysician health care professionals. Part 41 of this work is ensuring that health care teams are led by physicians and that nonphysicians have 42 requisite physician supervision. For this reason, the Council makes the recommendations below to 43 ensure use of the phrase \"physician -led\" to modify \"interprofessional teams\" in medical education 44 accreditation standards. 45 46 As noted in this report, if preparation for physician practice does not include leadership of teams as 47 a component, the n this eleme nt should be incorporated into medical education. Toward this end, the 48 Council would refer interested delegates to a second report slated for the 2023 Annual Meeting, 49 Council on Medical Education Report 7- A-23, \" Management and Leadership Training in Medica l 50 Education.\" This report seeks to \"study the extent of the impact of AMA Policy D -295.316, 51 CME Rep. 09-A-23 -- page 8 of 17 'Management and Leadership for Physicians,' on elective curriculum and \"expand efforts to 1 promote the tenets of health systems science to prepare trainees for leadership roles and address 2 prevalent challenges in the practice of medicine and public health. \" 3 4 The Council on Medical Education therefore recommends that the following recommendations be 5 adopted in lieu of Resolution 201-A-22 and the remainder of th e report be filed: 6 7 1. That the American Medical Association (AMA) encourage appropriate medical education 8 accreditation organizations in allopathic and osteopathic medicine including the Liaison 9 Committee on Medical Education, Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation, 10 American Osteopathic Association, and Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical 11 Education to: 12 13 A) Incorporate the phrase \"physician- led\" as a modifier for \" interprofessional education\" 14 into the ir relevant medical education accreditation standards , where appropriate ; 15 16 B) Require education in and evaluation of competency in physician-led interprofessional 17 health care team leadership as part of the systems- based practice competency in medical 18 education accreditation standards . (New HOD Poli cy) 19 20 2. That the AMA encourage medical educators to study how interprofessional learning and 21 teamwork promote the development of physician leadership in team- based care. (New HOD 22 Policy) 23 24 3. Amend D- 295.934 (2) by addition as follows: \" Our AMA supports the concept that medical 25 education should prepare students for practice in , and leadership of, physician- led 26 interprofessional health care teams.\" (New HOD Policy) 27 28 4. That the AMA encourage medical standard s-setting organi zations , including the American 29 Board of Medical Specialties and its member boards , to inform policymakers of the 30 standards physicians are held to for independent practice in order to protect patients and that 31 these standards make physicians the appropriate leaders of the interprofessional health care 32 team . (Modify Current HOD Policy) 33 Fiscal note: $1,000 CME Rep. 09-A-23 -- page 9 of 17 APPENDIX: RELEVANT AMA POLICY D-295.934, \"Encouragement of Interprofessional Education Among Health Care Professions Students\" 1. Our AMA recognizes that interprofessional education and partnerships are a priority of the American medical education system. 2. Our AMA supports the concept that medical education should prepare students for practice in physician- led interprofessional tea ms. 3. Our AMA will encourage health care organizations that engage in a collaborative care model to provide access to an appropriate mix of role models and learners. 4. Our AMA will encourage the development of skills for interprofessional education tha t are applicable to and appropriate for each group of learners. 5. Our AMA supports the concept that interprofessional education include a mechanism by which members of interdisciplinary teams learn about, with, and from each other; and that this education include learning about differences in the depth and breadth of their educational backgrounds, experiences, and knowledge and the impact these differences may have on patient care. 6. Our AMA supports a clear mechanism for medical school and appropriate i nstitutional leaders to intervene when undergraduate and graduate medical education is being adversely impacted by undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate clinical training programs of non-physicians.

Our AMA defines 'team- based health care' as the provision of health care services by a physician- led team of at least two health care professionals who work collaboratively with each other and the patient and family to accomplish shared goals within and across settings to achieve coordinated, high- quality, patient -centered care. 2. Our AMA will advocate that the physician leader of a physician- led interprofessional health care team be empowered to perform the full range of medical interventions that she or he is trained to perform. 3. Our AMA will advocate that all members of a physician -led interprofessional health care team be enabled to perform medical interventions that they are capable of performing according to their education, training and licensure and the discretion of the physician team leader in order to most effectively provide quality patient care. 4. Our AMA adopts the following principles to guide physician leaders of health care teams: a. Focus the team on patient and family- centered care. b. Make clear the team's mission, vision and values. c. Direct and/or engage in collaboration with team members on patient care. d. Be accountable for clinical care, quality improvement, efficiency of care, and continuing education. e.

Facilitate the work of the team and be responsible for reviewing team members' clinical work and documentation. k. Review measures of 'population health' periodically when t he team is responsible for the care of a defined group. 5. Our AMA encourages independent physician practices and small group practices to consider opportunities to form health care teams such as through independent practice associations, virtual networks or other networks of independent providers. 6. Our AMA will advocate that the structure, governance and compensation of the team should be aligned to optimize the performance of the team leader and team members.

(2) The physician is responsible for managing the health care of patients in all practice settings. (3) Health care services delivered in an integrated practice must be within the scope of each practitioner's professional license, as defined by state law. (4) In an integrated practice with a nurse practitioner, the physician is responsible for supervising and coordinating care and, with the appropriate input of the nurse practitioner, ensuring the quality of health care provided to patients. (5) The extent of i nvolvement by the nurse practitioner in initial assessment, and implementation of treatment will depend on the complexity and acuity of the patients' condition, as determined by the supervising/collaborating physician. (6) The role of the nurse practition er in the delivery of care in an integrated practice should be defined through mutually agreed upon written practice protocols, job descriptions, and written contracts. (7) These practice protocols should delineate the appropriate involvement of the two professionals in the care of patients, based on the complexity and acuity of the patients' condition. (8) At least one physician in the integrated practice must be immediately available at all times for supervision and consultation when needed by the nurse practitioner. (9) Patients are to be made clearly aware at all times whether they are being cared for by a physician or a nurse practitioner. (10) In an integrated practice, there should be a professional and courteous relationship between physician and nurse practitioner, with mutual acknowledgment of, and respect for each other's contributions to patient care. (11) Physicians and nurse practitioners should review and document, on a regular basis, the care of all patients with whom the nurse practitioner is involved. Physicians and nurse practitioners must work closely enough together to become fully conversant with each other's practice patterns.

Our AMA defines 'physician- led' in the context of team -based health care as the consistent use by a physician of the leadership knowledge, skills and expertise necessary to identify, engage and elicit from each team member the unique set of training, experience, and qualifications needed to help patients achieve their care goals, and to supervise the application of these skills. 2. Our AMA supports the following elements that should be considered when planning a team- based care model according to the needs of each physician practice: Patient -Centered: a. The patient is an integral member of the team. b. A relationship is established between the patient and the team at the onset of care, and the role of each team member is explained to the patient. c. Patient and family -centered care is prioritized by the team and approved by the physician team leader. d. Team members are expected to adhere to agreed -upon practice protocols . e. Improving health outcomes is emphasized by focusing on health as well as medical care. f. Patients' access to the team, or coverage as designated by the physician -led team, is available twenty -four hours a day, seven days a week. g. Safety protocols a re developed and followed by all team members. Teamwork: h. Medical teams are led by physicians who have ultimate responsibility and authority to carry out final decisions about the composition of the team. i. All practitioners commit to working in a team -based care model. j. The number and variety of practitioners reflects the needs of the practice. k. Practitioners are trained according to their unique function in the team. l. Interdependence among team members is expected and relied upon. m. Communication about patient care between team members is a routine practice. n. Team members complete tasks according to agreed -upon protocols as directed by the physician leader. Clinical Roles and Responsibilities: o. Physician leaders are focused on individualized patient care and the development of treatment plans. p. Non-physician practitioners are focused on providing treatment within their scope of practice consistent with their education and training as outlined in the agreed upon treatment plan or as delegated under the supervision of the physician team leader. q. Care coordination and case management are integral to the team's practice. r. Population management monitors the cost and use of care, and includes registry development for most medical conditions. Practice Management: s. Electronic medical records are used to the fullest capacity. t. Quality improvement processes are used and continuously evolve according to physician- led team -based practice assessments. CME Rep. 09-A-23 -- page 13 of 17 u. Data analytics include stati stical and qualitative analysis on cost and utilization, and provide explanatory and predictive modeling. v.

(2) Medical societies should work with legislatures and licensing boards to prevent dilution of the authority of physicians to lead the health care team. (3) Exercising independent medical judgment to selec t the drug of choice must continue to be the responsibility only of physicians. (4) Physicians should recognize physician assistants and advanced practice nurses under physician leadership, as effective physician extenders and valued members of the health care team. (5) Physicians should encourage state medical and nursing boards to explore the feasibility of working together to coordinate their regulatory initiatives and activities. (6) Physicians must be responsible and have authority for initiating and implementing quality control programs for nonphysicians delivering medical care in integrated practices.

Although physicians have overall responsibility for the quality of care that patients receive, allied health professionals have training and exper tise that complements physicians'. With physicians, allied health professionals share a common commitment to patient well-being. In light of this shared commitment, physicians' relationships with allied health professionals should be based on mutual respe ct and trust. It is ethically appropriate for physicians to: (a) Help support high quality education that is complementary to medical training, including by teaching in recognized schools for allied health professionals. (b) Work in consultation with or employ appropriately trained and credentialed allied health professionals. (c) Delegate provision of medical services to an appropriately trained and credentialed allied health professional within the individual's scope of practice. AMA Principles of Medica l Ethics: I,V,VII CME Rep. 09-A-23 -- page 14 of 17 The Opinions in this chapter are offered as ethics guidance for physicians and are not intended to establish standards of clinical practice or rules of law. (Issued: 2016) H-35.989, \" Physician Assistants \" 1. Our AMA opposes legislation to increase public funding for programs to train physician assistants and supports a careful reevaluation of the need for public funding at the time that present legislative authorities ex pire. 2. A physician assistant should provide patient care services only in accord with the medical practice act and other applicable state law, and such law should provide that the physician assistant's utilization by a physician or group of physicians be approved by the medical licensing board. A licensed physician or group of physicians seeking to utilize a physician assistant should submit to the medical licensing board an application for utilization that identifies: the qualifications and experience of the physician assistant, the qualifications and experience of the supervising physician and a description of his or her practice, and a description of the manner and the health care settings in which the assistant will be utilized, and the arrangements f or supervision by the responsible physician. Such an application should also specify the number of physician assistants that the physician or group of physicians plans to employ and supervise. A physician assistant should be authorized to provide patient c are services only so long as the assistant is functioning under the direction and supervision of a physician or group of physicians whose application for utilization has been approved by the medical licensing board. State medical licensing boards, in their review of applications for utilization of a physician assistant, should take special care to insure that the proposed physician assistant functions not be of a type which: (a) would unreasonably expand the professional scope of practice of the supervising physician, (b) cannot be performed safely and effectively by the physician assistant, or (c) would authorize the unlicensed practice of medicine. 3. The physician assistant should function under the direction of and supervision by a duly qualified licens ed physician. The physician must always maintain the ultimate responsibility to assure that high quality care is provided to every patient. In discharging that responsibility, the physician should exercise that amount of control or supervision over a physi cian assistant which is appropriate for the maintenance of quality medical care and in accord with existing state law and the rules and regulations of the medical licensing authority. Such supervision in most settings includes the personal presence or participation of the physician. In certain instances, such as remote practice settings, where the physician assistant may function apart from the supervising physician, such remote function (if permitted by state law) should be approved by the state medical licensing board on an individual basis. Such approval should include requirements for regular reporting to the supervising physician, frequent site visits by that physician, and arrangements for immediate communication with the supervising physician for cons ultation at all times. The physician assistant may serve the patients of the supervising physician in all types of health care settings, including but not limited to: physician's office, ambulatory or outpatient facility, clinic, hospital, patient's home, long-term care facility or nursing home. The state medical licensing board should determine on an individual basis the number of physician assistants that a particular physician may supervise or a group of physicians may employ. 4. While it is preferable and desirable that the physician assistant be employed by a physician or group of physicians so as to ensure appropriate physician supervision in the interests of the patient, where a physician assistant is employed by a hospital, the physician assistant m ust provide patient CME Rep. 09-A-23 -- page 15 of 17 care services in accordance with the rules and procedures established by the organized medical staff for utilization of physician-employed physician assistants functioning in that institution, and under the direction and supervision of a designated physician who has been approved by the state medical licensing board to supervise that physician assistant in accordance with a specific utilization plan and who shall be directly responsible as the attending physician for the patient care services delegated to his physician assistant. 5. The AMA opposes legislation or proposed regulations authorizing physician assistants to make independent medical judgments as to the drug of choice for an individual patient. 6. In view of an announced interest by HHS in considering national legislation which would override state regulatory systems for health manpower, the AMA recommends that present Association policy supporting state prerogatives in this area be strongly reaffirmed. 7. Our AMA opposes legislation or regulation that allows physician assistant independent practice. (BOT/CME/CMS Joint Rep., I -80; Reaffirmed: CLRPD Rep.

The suggested Guidelines for Physician/Physician Assistant Practice are adopted to re ad as follows (these guidelines shall be used in their entirety): (1) The physician is responsible for managing the health care of patients in all settings. (2) Health care services delivered by physicians and physician assistants must be within the scope of each practitioner's authorized practice, as defined by state law. (3) The physician is ultimately responsible for coordinating and managing the care of patients and, with the appropriate input of the physician assistant, ensuring the quality of healt h care provided to patients. (4) The physician is responsible for the supervision of the physician assistant in all settings. (5) The role of the physician assistant in the delivery of care should be defined through mutually agreed upon guidelines that are developed by the physician and the physician assistant and based on the physician's delegatory style. (6) The physician must be available for consultation with the physician assistant at all times, either in person or through telecommunication systems or other means. (7) The extent of the involvement by the physician assistant in the assessment and implementation of treatment will depend on the complexity and acuity of the patient's condition and the training, experience, and preparation of the physici an assistant, as adjudged by the physician. CME Rep. 09-A-23 -- page 16 of 17 (8) Patients should be made clearly aware at all times whether they are being cared for by a physician or a physician assistant. (9) The physician and physician assistant together should review all delegated pa tient services on a regular basis, as well as the mutually agreed upon guidelines for practice.

Will, in conjunction with the Federation, aggressively advocate for the definition of physician to be limited as defined above: a. In any federal or state law or regulation including the Social Security Act or any other law or regulation that defines physician; b. To any federal and state legislature or agency including the Department of Health and Human Services, Federal Aviation Administration, the Department of Transportation, or any other federal or state agency that defines physician; and c. To any accrediting body or deeming authority including the Joint Commission, Health Facilities Accreditation Program, or any other potential body or authority that defines phy sician. 3. Urges all physicians to insist on being identified as a physician, to sign only those professional or medical documents identifying them as physicians, and to not let the term physician be used by any other organization or person involved in hea lth care. 4. Ensure that all references to physicians by government, payers, and other health care entities involving contracts, advertising, agreements, published descriptions, and other communications at all times distinguish between physician, as define d above, and non- physicians and to discontinue the use of the term provider. 5. Policy requires any individual who has direct patient contact and presents to the patient as a doctor, and who is not a physician, as defined above, must specifically and simul taneously declare themselves a non-physician and define the nature of their doctorate degree. 6. Will review and revise its own publications as necessary to conform with the House of Delegates' policies on physician identification and physician reference and will refrain from any definition of physicians as providers that is not otherwise covered by existing Journal of the American Medical Association ( JAMA ) Editorial Governance Plan, which protects the editorial independence of JAMA. 7.

Study institutional and systemic factors associated with the unmatched medical graduate 7 status, including, but not limited to: 8 a) The GME bottleneck on training positions, including the balance of entry -level 9 position and categorical/advanced positions; 10 b) New medical schools and the expansion of medical school class sizes; 11 c) Race, geography, income, wealth, primary language, gender, reli gion, ability, and 12 other structural factors; 13 d) Student loan debt; 14 e) Predatory business practices by medical schools, loan agencies, private equity, 15 and other groups that prioritize profit over student success rates; 16 f) The context, history, and impact of past reports on the state of undergraduate 17 medical education, including the Flexner Report; 18 g) The format and variations of institutional and medical organization guidance on 19 best practices to successful matching; 20 2. Develop best practices for medical schools and medical organizations to support 21 unmatched medical graduates, including, but not limited to: 22 a) Tools to identify and remediate students at high risk for not matching into GME 23 programs; 24 b) Adequate data on student success rates (e.g., by specialty), and factors 25 associ ated with success in matching; 26 c) Medical school responsibilities to unmatched medical students and graduates; 27 d) Outcomes -based tuition relief or reimbursement for unmatched students, 28 wherein, unmatched students are returned some component of their tuition to 29 ease the financial burden of being unable to practice clinical medicine; 30 e) Transparent, equity -based solutions to address and ameliorate any inequities 31 identified in the match process; 32 f) Alternative, cost -neutral, graduate -level degrees with earlier graduation for 33 students at high risk for not matching; 34 g) Career opportunities for unmatched U.S. seniors and US -IMGs; and 35 3. Require transparency from stakeholders, including medical schools, about any actions 36 taken based on the report of this task force, particularly wit h regard to the remediation of 37 medical students.

(2) will actively participate in the evaluation of, and provide timely comments about, all proposals to modify the NRMP Match; (3) will request that the NRMP explore the possibility of including the Osteopathic Match in the NRMP Match; (4) will continue to review the NRMP's policies and procedures and make recommendations for improvements as the need arises, to include making the conditions of the Match agreement more transparent while assuring the confidentiality of the match; (5) will work with the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and other appropriate agencies to assure that the terms of employment for resident physicians are fair and equitable and reflect the unique and extensive amount of education and experience acquired by physicians; (6) does not support the current the \"All -In\" policy for the Main Residency Match to the extent that it eliminates flexibility within the match process; (7) will work with the NRMP, and other residency match programs, in revising Match policy, including the secondary match or scramble process to create more standardized rules for all candidates including application timelines and requirements; (8) will work with the NRMP and other external bodies to develop mechanisms that limit disparities within the residency application process and allow both flexibility and standard rules for applicants; (9) encourages the National Resident Matching Program to study and publish the effects of implementation of the Supplemental Offer and Acceptance Program on the number of residency spots not filled through the Main Residency Match and include stratified analysis by specialty and other relevant areas; (10) will work with the NRMP and ACGME to evaluate the challenges in moving from a time- based education framework toward a competency -based system, including: a) analysis of time- based implications of the ACGME milestones for residency programs; b) the impact on the NRMP and entry into residency programs if medical education programs offer variable time lengths based on acquisition of competencies; c) the impact on financial aid for medical students with variable time lengths of medical education programs; d) the implications for interprofessional education and rewarding teamwork; and e) the implications for residents and students who achieve milestones earlier or later than their peers; (11) will work with the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), American Osteopathic Resolution: 303 (A-23) Page 4 of 13 Association (AOA), American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (AACOM), and National Resident Matching Program (NRMP) to evaluate the current available data or propose new studies that would help us learn how many students graduating from US medical schools each year do not enter into a US residency program; how many never enter into a US residency program; whether there is disproportionate impact on indi viduals of minority racial and ethnic groups; and what careers are pursued by those with an MD or DO degree who do not enter residency programs; (12) will work with the AAMC, AOA, AACOM and appropriate licensing boards to study whether US medical school gr aduates and international medical graduates who do not enter residency programs may be able to serve unmet national health care needs; (13) will work with the AAMC, AOA, AACOM and the NRMP to evaluate the feasibility of a national tracking system for US me dical students who do not initially match into a categorical residency program; (14) will discuss with the National Resident Matching Program, Association of American Medical Colleges, American Osteopathic Association, Liaison Committee on Medical Educatio n, Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, and other interested bodies potential pathways for reengagement in medicine following an unsuccessful match and report back on the results of those discussions; (15) encourages the Association of American Medical Colleges to work with U.S. medical schools to identify best practices, including career counseling, used by medical schools to facilitate successful matches for medical school seniors, and reduce the number who do not match;

Our AMA encourages the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, the American Osteopathic Association, and other involved organizations to strongly encourage residency programs that now require a preliminary year to match residents for thei r specialty and then arrange with another department or another medical center for the preliminary year of training unless the applicant chooses to pursue preliminary year training separately. 2. Our AMA encourages appropriate stakeholders to explore options to decrease the burden upon medical students who must apply to separate preliminary PGY -1 and categorical PGY -2 positions. 3. Our AMA will work with the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education to encourage programs with PGY -2 positions in t he National Resident Matching Program (NRMP) with insufficient availability of local PGY -1 positions to create local PGY -1 positions that will enable coordinated applications and interviews for medical students. 4. Our AMA encourages the NRMP, the San Francisco Match, the American Urological Association, the Electronic Residency Application Service, and other stakeholders to reduce barriers for medical students, residents, and physicians applying to match into training programs, including barriers to \"coupl es matching,\" and to ensure that all applicants have access to robust, informative statistics to assist in decision -making. 5. Our AMA encourages the NRMP, San Francisco Match, American Urological Association, Electronic Residency Application Service, and other stakeholders to collect and publish data on a) the impact of separate matches on the personal and professional lives of medical students and b) the impact on medical students who are unable to successfully \"couples match\" with their significant others due to staggered entry into residency, utilization of unlinked match services, or other causes.

Our AMA: (a) encourages the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) to address the problem of non -educational closing or downsizing of residency training programs; (b) reminds all institutions involved in educating residents of their contractual responsibilities to the resident; (c) encourages the ACGME and the various Residency Review Committees to reexamine requirements for \"years of continuous training\" to determine the need for implementing waivers to accommodate residents affected by non- educational closure or downsizing; (d) will work w ith the American Board of Medical Specialties Member Boards to encourage all its member boards to develop a mechanism to accommodate the discontinuities in training that arise from residency closures, regardless of cause, including waiving continuity care requirements and granting residents credit for partial years of training; (e) urges residency programs and teaching hospitals be monitored by the applicable Residency Review Committees to ensure that decreases in resident numbers do not place undue stress on remaining residents by affecting work hours or working conditions, as specified in Residency Review Committee requirements; (f) opposes the closure of residency/fellowship programs or reductions in the number of current positions in programs as a result of changes in GME funding; and (g) will work with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), ACGME, and other appropriate organizations to advocate for the development and implementation of effective policies to permit graduate medical education funding to follow the resident physician from a closing to the receiving residency program (including waivers of CMS caps), in the event of temporary or permanent residency program closure. 2. Our AMA will work with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to establish regulations that protect residents and fellows impacted by program or hospital closure, which may include recommendations for: A. Notice by the training hospital, intending to file for bankruptcy within 30 days, to all residents and fellows primarily associated with the training hospital, as well as those contractually matched at that training institution who may not yet have matriculated, of its intention to close, along with provision of reasonable and appropriate proc edures to assist current and matched residents and fellows to find and obtain alternative training positions that minimize undue financial and professional consequences, including but not limited to maintenance of specialty choice, length of training, init ial expected time of graduation, location and reallocation of funding, and coverage of tail medical malpractice insurance that would have been offered had the program or hospital not closed; B. Revision of the current CMS guidelines that may prohibit trans fer of funding prior to formal financial closure of a teaching institution; C. Improved provisions regarding transfer of GME funding for displaced residents and fellows for the duration of their training in the event of program closure at a training instit ution; and D. Protections against the discrimination of displaced residents and fellows consistent with H -295.969. 3. Our AMA will work with the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, Association of American Medical Colleges, National Resident Matching Program, Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and other relevant stakeholders to identify a process by which displaced residents and fellows may be directly represented in proceedings surrounding the closure of a training hospital or program. 4. Our AMA will work with the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, Association of American Medical Colleges, National Resident Matching Program, Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and other relevant stakeholders to: A. Develop a stepwise algorithm for designated institutional officials and program directors to assist residents and fellows with finding and obtaining alternative training positions; B. Create a centralized, regulated process for displaced residents and fellows to obtain new training positions; and C. Develop pathways that ensure that closing and accepting institutions provide liability insurance coverage to residents, at no cost to residents. Citation: Sub.

Information regarding race and ethnicity may be voluntarily provided by residency and fellowship applicants; 4.encourages the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) and its Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) Advisory Committee to develop steps to minimize bias in the ERAS and the residency training selection process; and 5. will advocate that modifications in the ERAS Residency Application to minimize bias consider the effects these changes may have on efforts to increase diversity in residency programs. Citation: Res. 307, A -09; Appended: Res. 955, I -17; Protection of Resident and Fellow Training in the Case of Hospital or Training Program Closure D - 310.948 Our AMA will: 1. ask the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to stipulate in its regulations that residency slots are not assets that belong to the teaching institution; 2. encourage the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (AACOM), and National Resident Matching Program (NRMP) to develop a process similar to the S upplemental Offer and Acceptance Program (SOAP) that could be used in the event of a sudden teaching institution or program closure; 3. encourage the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) to specify in its Institutional Requirements that sponsoring institutions are to provide residents and residency applicants information regarding the financial health of the institution, such as its credit rating, or if it has recently been part of an acquisition or merger; 4. work with AAMC, AACOM, ACGME, and relevant state and specialty societies to coordinate and collaborate on the communication with sponsoring institutions, residency programs, and resident physicians in the event of a sudden institution or program closure to minimize confusion, reduce misinformation, and increase clarity; 5. encourage ACGME to revise its Institutional Requirements, under section IV.E., Professional Liability Insurance, to state that sponsoring institutions must create and maintain a fund that will ensure professional liability coverage for residents in the event of an institution or program closure; and 6. continue to work with ACGME, interested specialty societies, and others to monitor issues, collect data, and share information related to training programs run by corporate and nonprofit entities and their effect on medical education. Citation: CME Rep. 3, I -20; Modified: CME Rep. 01, I -22; Residency Interview Schedules H -310.998 1. Our AMA encourages residency and fellowship programs to incorporate in their int erview dates increased flexibility, whenever possible, to accommodate applicants' schedules. Our AMA encourages the ACGME and other accrediting bodies to require programs to provide, by electronic or other means, representative contracts to applicants prior to the interview. Our AMA encourages residency and fellowship programs to inform applicants in a timely manner confirming receipt of application and ongoing changes in the status of consideration of the application. 2. Our AMA will: (a) oppose changes to residency and fellowship application requirements unless (i) those changes have been evaluated by working groups which have students and residents as representatives, (ii) there are data which demonstrates that the proposed application components contribu te to an accurate representation of the candidate, (iii) there are data available to demonstrate that the new application requirements reduce, or at least do not increase, the impact of bias that affects medical students and residents from underrepresented minority backgrounds, and (iv) the costs to medical students and residents are mitigated; and (b) continue to work with specialty societies, the Resolution: 303 (A-23) Page 7 of 13 Association of American Medical Colleges, the National Resident Matching Program and other relevant stakeholders to improve the application process in an effort to accomplish these requirements.

Our AMA's representatives to the ACGME are instructed to promote the principle that selection of residents should be based on a broad variety of evaluative criteria, and to propose that the ACGME General Requirements state clearly that residency program directors must not use NBME or USMLE ranked passing scores as a screening criterion for residency selection. 2. Our AMA adopts the following policy on NBME or USMLE examination scoring: (a) Students receive \"pass/fail\" scores as soon as they are available. (If students fail the examinations, they may request their numerical scores immediately.) (b) Numerical scores are reported to the state licensing authorities upon request by the app licant for licensure. At this time, the applicant may request a copy of his or her numerical scores. (c) Scores are reported in pass/fail format for each student to the medical school. The school also receives a frequency distribution of numerical scores f or the aggregate of their students. 3. Our AMA will: (a) promote equal acceptance of the USMLE and COMLEX at all United States residency programs; (b) work with appropriate stakeholders including but not limited to the National Board of Medical Examiners, Association of American Medical Colleges, National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners, Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education and American Osteopathic Association to educate Residency Program Directors on how to interpret and use COMLEX s cores; and (c) work with Residency Program Directors to promote higher COMLEX utilization with residency program matches in light of the new single accreditation system. 4. Our AMA will work with appropriate stakeholders to release guidance for residency and fellowship program directors on equitably comparing students who received 3- digit United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 or Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination of the United States Level 1 scores and students who received Pass/Fail scores.

Our AMA will actively collaborate with appropriate stakeholder organizations, (including Association of American Medical Colleges, American Hospital Association, state medical societies, medical specialty societies/associations) to advocate for the preservation, stability and expansion of full funding for the direct and indirect costs of graduate medical education (GME) positions from all existing sources (e.g. Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Administration, CDC and others). 2. Our AMA will actively advocate for the stable provision of matching federal funds for state Medicaid programs that fund GME positions. 3. Our AMA will actively seek congressional action to remove the caps on Medicare funding of GME positions for resident physicians that were imposed by the Balanced Budget Amendment of 1997 (BBA - 1997). 4. Our AMA will strenuously advocate for increasing the number of GME positions to address the future physician workforce needs of the nation. 5. Our AMA will oppose efforts to move federal funding of GME positions to the annual appropriations process that is subject to instability and uncertainty. 6. Our AMA will oppose regulatory and legislative efforts that reduce funding for GME from the full scope of resident educational activities that are designated by residency programs for accreditation and the board certification of their graduates (e.g. didactic teaching, community service, of f-site ambulatory rotations, etc.). 7. Our AMA will actively explore additional sources of GME funding and their potential impact on the quality of residency training and on patient care. 8. Our AMA will vigorously advocate for the continued and expanded c ontribution by all payers for health care (including the federal government, the states, and local and private sources) to fund both the direct and indirect costs of GME. 9. Our AMA will work, in collaboration with other stakeholders, to improve the awareness of the general public that GME is a public good that provides essential services as part of the training process and Resolution: 303 (A-23) Page 8 of 13 serves as a necessary component of physician preparation to provide patient care that is safe, effective and of high quality. 10. Our A MA staff and governance will continuously monitor federal, state and private proposals for health care reform for their potential impact on the preservation, stability and expansion of full funding for the direct and indirect costs of GME. 11. Our AMA: (a) recognizes that funding for and distribution of positions for GME are in crisis in the United States and that meaningful and comprehensive reform is urgently needed; (b) will immediately work with Congress to expand medical residencies in a balanced fashi on based on expected specialty needs throughout our nation to produce a geographically distributed and appropriately sized physician workforce; and to make increasing support and funding for GME programs and residencies a top priority of the AMA in its nat ional political agenda; and (c) will continue to work closely with the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, Association of American Medical Colleges, American Osteopathic Association, and other key stakeholders to raise awareness among pol icymakers and the public about the importance of expanded GME funding to meet the nation's current and anticipated medical workforce needs. 12. Our AMA will collaborate with other organizations to explore evidence- based approaches to quality and accountabi lity in residency education to support enhanced funding of GME. 13. Our AMA will continue to strongly advocate that Congress fund additional graduate medical education (GME) positions for the most critical workforce needs, especially considering the current and worsening maldistribution of physicians. 14. Our AMA will advocate that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services allow for rural and other underserved rotations in Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) -accredited residenc y programs, in disciplines of particular local/regional need, to occur in the offices of physicians who meet the qualifications for adjunct faculty of the residency program's sponsoring institution. 15. Our AMA encourages the ACGME to reduce barriers to rural and other underserved community experiences for graduate medical education programs that choose to provide such training, by adjusting as needed its program requirements, such as continuity requirements or limitations on time spent away from the primar y residency site. 16. Our AMA encourages the ACGME and the American Osteopathic Association (AOA) to continue to develop and disseminate innovative methods of training physicians efficiently that foster the skills and inclinations to practice in a health c are system that rewards team- based care and social accountability. 17. Our AMA will work with interested state and national medical specialty societies and other appropriate stakeholders to share and support legislation to increase GME funding, enabling a state to accomplish one or more of the following: (a) train more physicians to meet state and regional workforce needs; (b) train physicians who will practice in physician shortage/underserved areas; or (c) train physicians in undersupplied specialties and subspecialties in the state/region. 18. Our AMA supports the ongoing efforts by states to identify and address changing physician workforce needs within the GME landscape and continue to broadly advocate for innovative pilot programs that will increase the number of positions and create enhanced accountability of GME programs for quality outcomes. 19. Our AMA will continue to work with stakeholders such as Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), ACGME, AOA, American Academy of Family Physicians, A merican College of Physicians, and other specialty organizations to analyze the changing landscape of future physician workforce needs as well as the number and variety of GME positions necessary to provide that workforce. 20. Our AMA will explore innovati ve funding models for incremental increases in funded residency positions related to quality of resident education and provision of patient care as evaluated by appropriate medical education organizations such as the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medi cal Education. 21. Our AMA will utilize its resources to share its content expertise with policymakers and the public to ensure greater awareness of the significant societal value of graduate medical education (GME) in terms of patient care, particularly f or underserved and at -risk populations, as well as global health, research and education. 22. Our AMA will advocate for the appropriation of Congressional funding in support of the National Healthcare Workforce Commission, established under section 5101 of the Affordable Care Act, to provide data and healthcare workforce policy and advice to the nation and provide data that support the value of GME to the nation. 23. Our AMA supports recommendations to increase the accountability for and transparency of GME funding and continue to monitor data and peer -reviewed studies that contribute to further assess the value of GME. Resolution: 303 (A-23) Page 9 of 13 24. Our AMA will explore various models of all -payer funding for GME, especially as the Institute of Medicine (now a program unit of the Nat ional Academy of Medicine) did not examine those options in its 2014 report on GME governance and financing. 25. Our AMA encourages organizations with successful existing models to publicize and share strategies, outcomes and costs. 26. Our AMA encourages insurance payers and foundations to enter into partnerships with state and local agencies as well as academic medical centers and community hospitals seeking to expand GME. 27. Our AMA will develop, along with other interested stakeholders, a national campaign to educate the public on the definition and importance of graduate medical education, student debt and the state of the medical profession today and in the future. 28. Our AMA will collaborate with other stakeholder organizations to evaluate and work to establish consensus regarding the appropriate economic value of resident and fellow services. 29. Our AMA will monitor ongoing pilots and demonstration projects, and explore the feasibility of broader implementation of proposals that show promise as alternative means for funding physician education and training while providing appropriate compensation for residents and fellows. 30. Our AMA will monitor the status of t he House Energy and Commerce Committee's response to public comments solicited regarding the 2014 IOM report, Graduate Medical Education That Meets the Nation's Health Needs, as well as results of ongoing studies, including that requested of the GAO, in or der to formulate new advocacy strategy for GME funding, and will report back to the House of Delegates regularly on important changes in the landscape of GME funding. 31. Our AMA will advocate to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to adopt the concept of \"Cap- Flexibility\" and allow new and current Graduate Medical Education teaching institutions to extend their cap-building window for up to an additional five years beyond the current window (for a total of up to ten years), giving priority to new residency programs in underserved areas and/or economically depressed areas. 32. Our AMA will: (a) encourage all existing and planned allopathic and osteopathic medical schools to thoroughly research match statistics and other career placement metrics when developing career guidance plans; (b) strongly advocate for and work with legislators, private sector partnerships, and existing and planned osteopathic and allopathic medical schools to create and fund graduate medical education (GME) programs that can accommodate the equivalent number of additional medical school graduates consistent with the workforce needs of our nation; and (c) encourage the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME), the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA), and other accrediting bodies, as part of accreditation of allopathic and osteopathic medical schools, to prospectively and retrospectively monitor medical school graduates' rates of placement into GME as well as GME completion. 33. Our AMA encourages the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to coordinate with federal agencies that fund GME training to identify and collect information needed to effectively evaluate how hospitals, health systems, and health centers with residency programs are utilizing these financial resources to meet the nation's health care workforce needs. This includes information on payment amounts by the type of training programs supported, resident training costs and revenue generation, output or outcomes related t o health workforce planning (i.e., percentage of primary care residents that went on to practice in rural or medically underserved areas), and measures related to resident competency and educational quality offered by GME training programs. 34. Our AMA wil l publicize best practice examples of state- funded Graduate Medical Education positions and develop model state legislation where appropriate. Citation: Sub.

Our AMA, independently and in collaboration with other groups such as the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), will actively work and advocate for funding at the federal and state levels and Resolution: 303 (A-23) Page 10 of 13 in the private sector to support the following: (a) Pipeline programs to prepare and motivate members of underrepresented groups to enter medical school; (b) Diversity or minority affairs offices at medical schools; (c) Financial aid programs for students from groups that are underrepresented in medicine; and (d) Financial support programs to recruit and develop faculty members from underrepresented groups. 2. Our AMA will work to obtain full restoration and protection of federal Title VII funding, and s imilar state funding programs, for the Centers of Excellence Program, Health Careers Opportunity Program, Area Health Education Centers, and other programs that support physician training, recruitment, and retention in geographically -underserved areas. 3. Our AMA will take a leadership role in efforts to enhance diversity in the physician workforce, including engaging in broad- based efforts that involve partners within and beyond the medical profession and medical education community. 4. Our AMA will encour age the Liaison Committee on Medical Education to assure that medical schools demonstrate compliance with its requirements for a diverse student body and faculty. 5. Our AMA will develop an internal education program for its members on the issues and possi bilities involved in creating a diverse physician population. 6. Our AMA will provide on- line educational materials for its membership that address diversity issues in patient care including, but not limited to, culture, religion, race and ethnicity. 7. Our AMA will create and support programs that introduce elementary through high school students, especially those from groups that are underrepresented in medicine (URM), to healthcare careers. 8. Our AMA will create and support pipeline programs and encoura ge support services for URM college students that will support them as they move through college, medical school and residency programs. 9. Our AMA will recommend that medical school admissions committees and residency/fellowship programs use holistic asse ssments of applicants that take into account the diversity of preparation and the variety of talents that applicants bring to their education with the goal of improving health care for all communities. 10. Our AMA will advocate for the tracking and reporti ng to interested stakeholders of demographic information pertaining to URM status collected from Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) applications through the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP). 11. Our AMA will continue the research, adv ocacy, collaborative partnerships and other work that was initiated by the Commission to End Health Care Disparities. 12. Our AMA opposes legislation that would undermine institutions' ability to properly employ affirmative action to promote a diverse student population. 13. Our AMA will work with the AAMC and other stakeholders to create a question for the AAMC electronic medical school application to identify previous pipeline program (also known as pathway program) participation and create a plan to anal yze the data in order to determine the effectiveness of pipeline programs.

Our AMA continues to advocate for improvements in the ACGME Institutional and Common Program Requirements that support AMA policies as follows: a) adequate financial support for and guaranteed leave to attend professional meetings; b) submission of training verification information to requesting agencies within 30 days of the request; c) adequate compensation with consideration to local cost -of- living factors and years of trai ning, and to include the orientation period; d) health insurance benefits to include dental and vision services; e) paid leave for all purposes (family, educational, vacation, sick) to be no less than six weeks per year; and f) stronger due process guideli nes. 2. Our AMA encourages the ACGME to ensure access to educational programs and curricula as necessary to facilitate a deeper understanding by resident physicians of the US health care system and to increase their communication skills. 3. Our AMA regular ly communicates to residency and fellowship programs and other GME stakeholders this Resident/Fellows Physicians' Bill of Rights. 4. Our AMA: a) will promote residency and fellowship training programs to evaluate their own institution's process for repayment and develop a leaner approach. This includes disbursement of funds by direct deposit as opposed to a paper check and an online system of applying for funds; b) encourages a system of expedited repayment for purchases of $200 or less (or an equivalent institutional threshold), for example through payment directly from their residency and fellowship programs (in contrast to following traditional workflow for reimbursement); and c) encourages training programs to develop a budget and strategy for planned ex penses versus unplanned expenses, where planned expenses should be estimated using historical data, and should include trainee reimbursements for items such as educational materials, attendance at conferences, and entertaining applicants. Payment in advanc e or within one month of document submission is strongly recommended. 5. Our AMA will partner with ACGME and other relevant stakeholders to encourage training programs to reduce financial burdens on residents and fellows by providing employee benefits incl uding, but not limited to, on -call meal allowances, transportation support, relocation stipends, and childcare services. 6. Our AMA will work with the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and other relevant stakeholders to amend the ACGME Common Program Requirements to allow flexibility in the specialty -specific ACGME program requirements enabling specialties to require salary reimbursement or \"protected time\" for resident and fellow education by \"core faculty,\" program directors, and assistant/associate program directors. 7. Our AMA encourages teaching institutions to offer retirement plan options, retirement plan matching, financial advising and personal finance education. 8. Our AMA adopts the following \"Residents and Fellows' Bill of Rights\" as applicable to all resident and fellow physicians in ACGME -accredited training programs: RESIDENT/FELLOW PHYSICIANS' BILL OF RIGHTS Residents and fellows have a right to: A. An education that fosters professional development, takes priority o ver service, and leads to Resolution: 303 (A-23) Page 12 of 13 independent practice. With regard to education, residents and fellows should expect: (1) A graduate medical education experience that facilitates their professional and ethical development, to include regularly scheduled didactics for which they are released from clinical duties. Service obligations should not interfere with educational opportunities and clinical education should be given priority over service obligations; (2) Faculty who devote sufficient time to the educational p rogram to fulfill their teaching and supervisory responsibilities; (3) Adequate clerical and clinical support services that minimize the extraneous, time-consuming work that draws attention from patient care issues and offers no educational value; (4) 24- hour per day access to information resources to educate themselves further about appropriate patient care; and (5) Resources that will allow them to pursue scholarly activities to include financial support and education leave to attend professional meetings . B. Appropriate supervision by qualified physician faculty with progressive resident responsibility toward independent practice. With regard to supervision, residents and fellows must be ultimately supervised by physicians who are adequately qualified and allow them to assume progressive responsibility appropriate to their level of education, competence, and experience. In instances where clinical education is provided by non-physicians, there must be an identified physician supervisor providing indirect s upervision, along with mechanisms for reporting inappropriate, non- physician supervision to the training program, sponsoring institution or ACGME as appropriate. C. Regular and timely feedback and evaluation based on valid assessments of resident performan ce. With regard to evaluation and assessment processes, residents and fellows should expect: (1) Timely and substantive evaluations during each rotation in which their competence is objectively assessed by faculty who have directly supervised their work; ( 2) To evaluate the faculty and the program confidentially and in writing at least once annually and expect that the training program will address deficiencies revealed by these evaluations in a timely fashion; (3) Access to their training file and to be made aware of the contents of their file on an annual basis; and (4) Training programs to complete primary verification/credentialing forms and recredentialing forms, apply all required signatures to the forms, and then have the forms permanently secured in their educational files at the completion of training or a period of training and, when requested by any organization involved in credentialing process, ensure the submission of those documents to the requesting organization within thirty days of the request. D. A safe and supportive workplace with appropriate facilities. With regard to the workplace, residents and fellows should have access to: (1) A safe workplace that enables them to fulfill their clinical duties and educational obligations; (2) Secure, clean, and comfortable on-call rooms and parking facilities which are secure and well -lit; (3) Opportunities to participate on committees whose actions may affect their education, patient care, workplace, or contract. E. Adequate compensation and b enefits that provide for resident well -being and health. (1) With regard to contracts, residents and fellows should receive: a. Information about the interviewing residency or fellowship program including a copy of the currently used contract clearly outli ning the conditions for (re)appointment, details of remuneration, specific responsibilities including call obligations, and a detailed protocol for handling any grievance; and b. At least four months advance notice of contract non-renewal and the reason for non- renewal. (2) With regard to compensation, residents and fellows should receive: a. Compensation for time at orientation; and b. Salaries commensurate with their level of training and experience. Compensation should reflect cost of living differences based on local economic factors, such as housing, transportation, and energy costs (which affect the purchasing power of wages), and include appropriate adjustments for changes in the cost of living. (3) With regard to benefits, residents and fellows must be fully informed of and should receive: a. Quality and affordable comprehensive medical, mental health, dental, and vision care for residents and their families, as well as retirement plan options, professional liability insurance and disability insurance to all residents for disabilities resulting from activities that are part of the educational program; b. An institutional written policy on and education in the signs of excessive fatigue, clinical depression, substance abuse and dependence, and other phy sician impairment issues; c. Confidential access to mental health and substance abuse services; d. A guaranteed, predetermined amount of paid vacation leave, sick leave, family and medical leave and educational/professional leave during each year in their training program, the total amount of which should not be less than six weeks; e. Leave in compliance with the Family and Medical Leave Act; and f. The conditions under which sleeping quarters, meals and laundry or their equivalent are to be provided. Resolution: 303 (A-23) Page 13 of 13 F. Clinical and educational work hours that protect patient safety and facilitate resident well -being and education. With regard to clinical and educational work hours, residents and fellows should experience: (1) A reasonable work schedule that is in compliance with clinical and educational work hour requirements set forth by the ACGME; and (2) At -home call that is not so frequent or demanding such that rest periods are significantly diminished or that clinical and educational work hour requirements are effect ively circumvented. Refer to AMA Policy H -310.907, \"Resident/Fellow Clinical and Educational Work Hours,\" for more information. G. Due process in cases of allegations of misconduct or poor performance. With regard to the complaints and appeals process, res idents and fellows should have the opportunity to defend themselves against any allegations presented against them by a patient, health professional, or training program in accordance with the due process guidelines established by the AMA. H. Access to and protection by institutional and accreditation authorities when reporting violations. With regard to reporting violations to the ACGME, residents and fellows should: (1) Be informed by their program at the beginning of their training and again at each semi -annual review of the resources and processes available within the residency program for addressing resident concerns or complaints, including the program director, Residency Training Committee, and the designated institutional official; (2) Be able to fil e a formal complaint with the ACGME to address program violations of residency training requirements without fear of recrimination and with the guarantee of due process; and (3) Have the opportunity to address their concerns about the training program through confidential channels, including the ACGME concern process and/or the annual ACGME Resident Survey. 9. Our AMA will work with the ACGME and other relevant stakeholders to advocate for ways to defray additional costs related to residency and fellowship training, including essential amenities and/or high cost specialty -specific equipment required to perform clinical duties. 10. Our AMA believes that healthcare trainee salary, benefits, and overall compensation should, at minimum, reflect length of pre-training education, hours worked, and level of independence and complexity of care allowed by an individual's training program (for example when comparing physicians in training and midlevel providers at equal postgraduate training levels). 11.The Resi dents and Fellows' Bill of Rights will be prominently published online on the AMA website and disseminated to residency and fellowship programs. 12. Our AMA will distribute and promote the Residents and Fellows' Bill of Rights online and individually to residency and fellowship training programs and encourage changes to institutional processes that embody these principles.

Adopted AMA BOT Rep- June 2008 RELEVANT AMA POLICY Clarification of Medical Necessity for Treatment of Gender Dysphoria H -185.927 Our AMA: (1) recognizes that medical and surgical treatments for gender dysphoria, as determined by shared decision making between the patient and physician, are medically necessary as outlined by generally -accepted standards of medical and surgical practice; (2) will advocate for federal, state, and local policies to provide medically necessary care for gender dysphoria; and (3) opposes the criminalization and otherwise undue restriction of evidence- based gender -affirming care. Citation: Res. 05, A -16; Modified: Res. 015, A -21; Removing Financial Barriers to Care for Transgender Patients H -185.950 Our AMA supports public and private health insurance coverage for treatment of gender dysphoria as recommended by the patient's physician. Citation: -08; 16; Reaffirmed: Res. 012, A- 22; Medical Spectrum of Gender D -295.312 Given the medical spectrum of gender identity and sex, our AMA: (1) will work with appropriate medical organizations and community based organizations to inform and educate the medical community and the public on the medical spectrum of gender identity; (2) will educate state and federal policymakers and legislators on and advocate for policies addressing the medical spectrum of gender identity to ensure access to quality health care; and (3) affirms that an individual's genotypic sex, phenotypic sex, sexual orientation, gender and gender identity are not always aligned or indicative of the other, and that gender for many individuals may differ from the sex assigned at birth. Citation: Res. 003, A -17; Modified: Res. 005, I -18; Support for Appropri ate Billing and Payment Procedures by Physicians D -385.968 Our AMA will oppose any attempts by federal and state legislatures, regulatory bodies, hospitals, private and government payers, and others to restrict reimbursement for procedures and services bas ed on physician specialty. Citation: BOT Rep. 32, A -08; Reaffirmed: CMS Rep. 01, A- 18; Health Care Needs of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Populations H -160.991 1. Our AMA: (a) believes that the physician's nonjudgmental recognition of patients' sexual orientations, sexual behaviors, and gender identities enhances the ability to render optimal patient care in health as well as in illness. In the case of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, and other (LGBTQ) patients, this recognition is especially important to address the specific health care needs of people who are or may be LGBTQ; (b) is committed to taking a leadership role in: (i) educating physicians on the current state of research in and knowledge of LGBTQ Health and the need to elicit relevant gender and sexuality information from our patients; these efforts should start in medical school, but must also be a part of continuing medical education; (ii) educating physicians to recognize the physical and psychological ne eds of LGBTQ patients; (iii) encouraging the development of educational programs in LGBTQ Health; (iv) encouraging physicians to seek out local or national experts in the health care needs of LGBTQ people so that all physicians will achieve a better understanding of the medical needs of these populations; and (v) working with LGBTQ communities to offer physicians the opportunity to better understand the medical needs of LGBTQ patients; and (c) opposes, the use of \"reparative\" or \"conversion\" therapy for sexual orientation or gender identity. 2. Our AMA will collaborate with our partner organizations to educate physicians regarding: (i) the need for sexual and gender minority individuals to undergo regular cancer and sexually transmitted infection screenings based on anatomy due to their comparable or elevated risk for these conditions; and (ii) the Resolution: 304 (A-23) Page 4 of 5 need for comprehensive screening for sexually transmitted diseases in men who have sex with men; (iii) appropriate safe sex techniques to avoid the risk for sexual ly transmitted diseases; and (iv) that individuals who identify as a sexual and/or gender minority (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning individuals) experience intimate partner violence, and how sexual and gender minorities present with intimate partner violence differs from their cisgender, heterosexual peers and may have unique complicating factors. 3. Our AMA will continue to work alongside our partner organizations, including GLMA, to increase physician competency on LGBTQ health issues. 4. Our AMA will continue to explore opportunities to collaborate with other organizations, focusing on issues of mutual concern in order to provide the most comprehensive and up- to-date education and information to enable the provision of high quality and culturally competent care to LGBTQ people.

Our AMA will convene a task force of appropriate AMA councils and interested state and medical specialty societies, in conjunction with the AMA Center for Health Equity, and in consultation with relevant organizations, practices, government bodies, and impacted communities for the purpose of preserving the patient -physician relationship. 2. This task force, which will serve at the direction of our AMA Board of Trustees, will inform the Board to help guide organized medicine's response to bans and restrictions on abortion, prepare for widespread criminalization of other evidence- based care, implement relevant AMA policies, and identify and create implementation- focused practice and advocacy resources on issues including but not limited to: a. He alth equity impact, including monitoring and evaluating the consequences of abortion bans and restrictions for public health and the physician workforce and including making actionable recommendations to mitigate harm, with a focus on the disproportionate impact on under -resourced, marginalized, and minoritized communities; b. Practice management, including developing recommendations and educational materials for addressing reimbursement, uncompensated care, interstate licensure, and provision of care, incl uding telehealth and care provided across state lines; c. Training, including collaborating with interested medical schools, residency and fellowship programs, academic centers, and clinicians to mitigate radically diminished training opportunities; d.

Our American Medical Association will insist that any new GME funding to support graduate medical education positions be available only to Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and/or American Osteopathic Association (AOA) accredited residency programs, and believes that funding made available to support the training of health care providers not be made at the expense of ACGME and/or AOA accredited residency programs. 2. Our AMA strongly advocates that: (A) there be no decreases in the current funding of MD and DO graduate medical education while there is a concurrent incr ease in funding of graduate medical education (GME) in other professions; and (B) there be at least proportional increases in the current funding of MD and DO graduate medical education similar to increases in funding of GME in other professions. 3. Our AMA will advocate to appropriate federal agencies, and other relevant stakeholders to oppose the diversion of direct and indirect funding away from ACGME -accredited graduate medical education programs.

(2) The federal government provide sufficient funds to support needed health services for American Indians. (3) State and local governments give special attention to the health and health- related needs of nonreservation American Indians in an effort to improve their quality of life. (4) American Indian religions and cultural beliefs be recognized and respected by those responsible for planning and providing services in Indian health programs. Resolution: 305 (A-23) Page 3 of 4 (5) Our AMA recognize the \"medicine man\" as an integral and culturally necessary individual in delivering health care to American Indians. (6) Strong emphasis be given to mental health programs for American Indians in an effort to reduce the high incidence of alcoholism, homicide, suicide, and accidents. (7) A team approach drawing from traditional health providers supplemented by psychiatric social workers, health aides, visiting nurses, and health educators be utilized in solving these problems. (8) Our AMA continue its liaison with the Indian Health Service and the National Indian Health Board and establish a liaison with the Association of American Indian Physicians. (9) State and county medical associations establish liaisons with intertribal health councils in those states where American Indians reside. (10) Our AMA supports and encourages further development and use of innovative delivery systems and staffing configurations to meet American Indian health needs but opp oses overemphasis on research for the sake of research, particularly if needed federal funds are diverted from direct services for American Indians. (11) Our AMA strongly supports those bills before Congressional committees that aim to improve the health of and health- related services provided to American Indians and further recommends that members of appropriate AMA councils and committees provide testimony in favor of effective legislation and proposed regulations. Citation: (CLRPD Rep. 3, I -98; Reaffirme d: Res. 221, A -07; Reaffirmation A -12; Reaffirmed: Res. 233, A- 13) Indian Health Service H -350.977 The policy of the AMA is to support efforts in Congress to enable the Indian Health Service to meet its obligation to bring American Indian health up to the general population level. The AMA specifically recommends: (1) Indian Population: (a) In current education programs, and in the expansion of educational activities suggested below, special consideration be given to involving the American Indian and Alaska native population in training for the various health professions, in the expectation that such professionals, if provided with adequate professional resources, facilities, and income, will be more likely to serve the tribal areas permanently; (b) Exploration with American Indian leaders of the possibility of increased numbers of nonfederal American Indian health centers, under tribal sponsorship, to expand the American Indian role in its own health care; (c) Increased involvement of private practitioners and facilities in American Indian care, through such mechanisms as agreements with tribal leaders or Indian Health Service contracts, as well as normal private practice relationships; and (d) Improvement in transportation to make access to existing private care easier for the American Indian population. (2) Federal Facilities: Based on the distribution of the eligible population, transportation facilities and roads, and the availability of alternative nonfederal resources, the AMA recommends that those India n Health Service facilities currently necessary for American Indian care be identified and that an immediate construction and modernization program be initiated to bring these facilities up to current standards of practice and accreditation. (3)Manpower : (a) Compensation for Indian Health Service physicians be increased to a level competitive with other Federal agencies and nongovernmental service; (b) Consideration should be given to increased compensation for service in remote areas; (c) In conjunction wi th improvement of Service facilities, efforts should be made to establish closer ties with teaching centers, thus increasing both the available manpower and the level of professional expertise available for consultation; (d) Allied health professional staffing of Service facilities should be maintained at a level appropriate to the special needs of the population served; (e) Continuing education opportunities should be provided for those health professionals serving these communities, and especially those in remote areas, and, increased peer contact, both to maintain the quality of care and to avert professional isolation; and (f) Consideration should be given to a federal statement of policy supporting continuation of the Public Health Service to reduce the great uncertainty now felt by many career officers of the corps. (4)Medical Societies : In those states where Indian Health Service facilities are located, and in counties containing or adjacent to Service facilities, that the appropriate medical societies should explore the possibility of increased formal liaison with local Indian Health Service physicians. Increased support from organized medicine for improvement of health care provided under their direction, including professional consultation and involvement in society activities should be pursued. (5) Our AMA also support the removal of any requirement for competitive bidding in the Indian Health Service that compromises proper care for the American Indian population. Resolution: 305 (A-23) Page 4 of 4 Citation: (CLRPD Rep. I -98; Reaf -08; Reaffirmation A -12; Reaffirmed: Res. 233, A -13) AMA Support of American Indian Health Career Opportunities H -350.981 AMA policy on American Indian health career opportunities is as follows: (1) Our AMA, and other national, stat e, specialty, and county medical societies recommend special programs for the recruitment and training of American Indians in health careers at all levels and urge that these be expanded. (2) ) Our AMA supports the inclusion of American Indians in establis hed medical training programs in numbers adequate to meet their needs. Such training programs for American Indians should be operated for a sufficient period of time to ensure a continuous supply of physicians and other health professionals, prioritize consideration of applicants who self -identify as American Indian or Alaska Native and can provide some form of affiliation with an American Indian or Alaska Native tribe in the United States, and support the successful advancement of these trainees. (3) Our A MA will utilize its resources to create a better awareness among physicians and other health providers of the special problems and needs of American Indians and particular emphasis will be placed on the need for stronger clinical exposure and a greater num ber of health professionals to work among the American Indian population. (4) Our AMA will continue to support the concept of American Indian self -determination as imperative to the success of American Indian programs, and recognize that enduring acceptabl e solutions to American Indian health problems can only result from program and project beneficiaries having initial and continued contributions in planning and program operations. (5) Our AMA acknowledges long- standing federal precedent that membership or lineal descent from an enrolled member in a federally recognized tribe is distinct from racial identification as American Indian or Alaska Native and should be considered in medical school admissions even when restrictions on race- conscious admissions pol icies are in effect.

and 3 4 Whereas, The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) reports peak 5 fertility occurs in the late teens and early twenties and issued a committee opinion 6 acknowledging that fertility decreases drastically in a woman's early thirties2,3; and 7 8 Whereas, ACOG has acknowledged advanced maternal age to be a pregnant woman who is 9 35 years of age or older and mothers considered to be of advanced maternal age have been 10 found to be at greater risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including chromosomal 11 abnormalities, adverse mate rnal outcomes, and miscarriage or stillbirth4,5; and 12 13 Whereas, An increasing number of females have been enrolling in medical school over the 14 years, with 55.5% of 2021- 2022 matriculants identifying as female6; and 15 16 Whereas, 68.5% of medical students report taking one or more gap years in between their 17 undergraduate institution and medical school in 2021 compared with 66.3% and 65.2% in 18 2020 and 2019 respectively, effectively increasing the average age of medical school 19 matriculants7,8,9; and 20 21 Whereas, The percentage of students pursuing non- degree research years has increased in 22 the last 15 years, and only 81% of matriculating MD- only students graduated in 4 years, the 23 lowest percentage to date10; and 24 25 Whereas, The average age of females completing their medical training is 31 and on 26 average, the age for female physicians give birth for the first time at 32 compared to 27 for 27 non-physicians11; and 28 29 Whereas, An estimated 25% of female physicians experience infertility, and the rate of 30 female physicians seeking fertility evaluation and requiring the use of reproductive 31 technology is six times higher than that of the general population12,13,14; and 32 33 Whereas, The rate of miscarriage among medical and surgical residents in North America is 34 almost three times higher than that of their non -physician counterparts15; and 35 36 Whereas, Female physicians have reported that their careers significantly influenced their 37 family planning and childbearing decisions, with many delaying childbearing to achieve 38 certain career milestones or balance a less \"family -friendly\" specialty16; and 39 Resolution: 306 (A-23) Page 2 of 5 Whereas, The most comprehensive study on physician fertility to date found that nearly 55% 1 of female participants would have attempted to conceive earlier in their careers if they had 2 known the prevalence of infertility among female physicians was as prevalent an issue as it 3 is16; and 4 5 Whereas, While medical students are more knowledgeable about fertility than their non- 6 medical student counterparts, several studies have found medical trainees are 7 underprepared to address topics such as age -related fertility decline, gamete preservation, 8 and the effectiveness of assisted reproductive technologies17-20; and 9 10 Whereas, Although 8.8% of matriculating medical students identified as gay, lesbian, or 11 bisexual and 0.7% identified as transgender or non- binary in 2019, there is little research on 12 fertility experiences among physicians of sexual and gender minority backgrounds21; and 13 14 Whereas, Transgender and non- binary individuals have complex fertility needs and face 15 challenges such as lack of timely information regarding gamete preservation, which may 16 further impact medical trainees in this population22; and 17 18 Whereas, Studies show that the average cost of an in vitro fertilization ( IVF) cycle is $13,000 19 and a successful IVF pregnancy costs upwards of $112,70023-25; and 20 21 Whereas, Oocyte cryopreservation is currently the gold standard for fertility preservation for 22 female patients with the estimated costs of one cycle being $7,000 -$9,253 with a long- term 23 estimated storage cost of $343 -$1,000 per year as of 201726-28; and 24 25 Whereas, Sperm cryopreservation is the process of retrieving and freezing the semen 26 sample with an estimated cost for one cycle of $74526; and 27 28 Whereas, 73% of medic al school graduates finished with education debt in 2021 with an 29 average of $203,062 for those indebted, not including any accumulated undergraduate 30 debt29; and 31 32 Whereas, Only seventeen states have laws that require insurers to either cover or offer 33 coverage for infertility diagnosis and treatment30; and 34 35 Whereas, Coverage of fertility benefits for faculty at the top 14 U.S. Medical Schools for 36 research as defined by the U.S. News and World Reports vary widely in their application, 37 particularly for cycle and coverage limitations for IVF coverage and limited fertility 38 preservation, even in states with legislation requiring infertility diagnosis and treatment 39 coverage or options31; and 40 41 Whereas, AMA Policy H -420.952 supports the WHO designation of infertility as a disease 42 state with multiple etiologies requiring a range of interventions to advance fertility treatment 43 and preservation; and 44 45 Whereas, AMA Policy H -185.922 supports the coverage of gamete preservation for 46 individuals for whom a medical diagnosis or treatment modality is expected to result in loss of 47 fertility; and 48 Resolution: 306 (A-23) Page 3 of 5 Whereas, AMA Policy H -310.902 encourages insurance providers to cover fertility 1 preservation and infertility treatment for residents and fellows, as well as supports the 2 accommodation of t hose persons seeking those services and treatments; and 3 4 Whereas, Although AMA Policy H -185.990 and H -185.926 support insurance coverage for 5 the diagnosis and treatment of infertility regardless of marital status or sexual orientation, 6 there is a current lack of policy specifically addressing fertility issues among medical 7 students; therefore be it 8 9 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association work with the Association of American 10 Medical Colleges and other appropriate organizations to develop gender - and sexual 11 minority -inclusive initiatives in medical education that raise awareness about (1) how peak 12 child-bearing years correspond to the peak career -building years for many medical students 13 and trainees; (2) the significant decline in oocyte quality and quantity and increase in 14 miscarriage and infertility rates, with increasing age in medical students and trainees; (3) the 15 high rate of infertility among medical students, trainees, and physicians; and (4) various 16 fertility preservation options and including cryopreservation of oocytes and sperm and 17 associated costs (Directive to Take Action); and be it further 18 19 RESOLVED, That our AMA work with relevant organizations to increase access to strategies 20 by which medical students can preserve fertility (such as cryopreservation of oocytes, sperm, 21 and embryos), with associated mechanisms for insurance coverage.

Published March 12, 2021. https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/insurance- coverage- for-infertility -laws.aspx RELEVANT AMA POLICY Recognition of Infertility as a Disease H -420.952 Our AMA supports the World Health Organizations designation of infertility as a disease state with multiple etiologies requiring a range of interventions to advance fertility treatment and prevention. Citation: Res. 518, A -17; Infertility and Fertility Pr eservation Insurance Coverage H -185.990 1. Our AMA advocates for third party payer health insurance carriers to make available insurance benefits for the diagnosis and treatment of recognized male and female infertility. 2. Our AMA advocates for payment for fertility preservation therapy services by all payers when iatrogenic infertility may be caused directly or indirectly by necessary medical treatments as determined by a licensed physician, and will support state and federal legislation requiring payment for fertility preservation therapy services by all payers when iatrogenic infertility may be caused directly or indirectly by necessary medical treatments as determined by a licensed physician, including but not limited to cryopreservation of embryos, sperm, oocytes, and ovarian and testicular tissue. 3. Our AMA advocates for the inclusion of impaired fertility as a consequence of gender -affirming hormone therapy and gender -affirming surgery within legislative definitions of iatrogenic infertility and supports access to fertility preservation services for those affected.

Citation: Res. 804, I -16; AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 307 (A-23) Introduced by: Medical Student Section Subject: Amending AMA Policy H- 295.858, \" Access to Confidential Health Services for Medical Students and Physicians \" to Include Annual Opt -Out Mental Health Screening for Suicide Prevention for Residents Referred to: Reference Committee C Whereas, Between 2000 and 2014, 66 resident physicians died by suicide - the second most 1 prevalent cause of resident death in that time frame after neoplastic diseases 1; and 2 3 Whereas, Psychological autopsy studies of physicians show that psychiatric illnesses such as 4 depression and substance abuse contribute to suicide among physicians2,3; and 5 6 Whereas, Resident physicians presenting with depression or depressive symptoms may be as 7 high as 43.2% with depressive symptoms increasing by 15.8% within a year of the onset of 8 residency training, with 28% of resident physicians experiencing a major depressive episode 9 during training4; and 10 11 Whereas, Medical interns have increased mean Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ -9) depression 12 scores from baseline through first year5, and residents demonstrate increased suicidal ideation of 13 nearly 370% in the first three months of training5, as well as high rates of burnout signs6, which has 14 independently been associated with increased risk for depression and suicide7; and 15 16 Whereas, Residency program directors tend to underestimate the rates of burnout among resident 17 physicians as 43% of residents reported that the inability to take time off of work as a significant 18 barrier to seeking help8; and 19 20 Whereas, Screening for burnout in gynecology residents found 89.8% demonstrated moderate 21 burnout9, and depression screening in Otolaryngology -Head and Neck Surgery residents was 22 demonstrated to be cost effective in identifying and treating mental health9; and 23 24 Whereas, Tools have been developed to evaluate physician burnout including the AMA sponsored 25 Physician Well -Being Index (PWBI), which has been used to screen physic ians, stratify by distress 26 level, and identify individuals likely to benefit from individualized support10, and the American 27 Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP) Interactive Screening Program (ISP), a confidential, 28 anonymous, web- based stress and depression questionnaire, and subsequent counselor 29 meeting11; and 30 31 Whereas, The University of California, San Diego, School of Medicine (UCSD) implemented 32 AFSP's ISP, and in the first year found that of the 374 respondents, 101 respondents and 251 33 respondents had a high risk and moderate risk for suicide, respectively, of which less than 20% 34 received treatment12; and 35 Resolution: 307 (A-23) Page 2 of 7 Whereas, UCSD implemented AFSP's ISP, and found that over the course of 7 years, 180 1 physicians and trainees at UCSD have accepted referrals for m ental health care, with the majority 2 saying they would not have done so on their own13; and 3 4 Whereas, Institutions that rely on self -referral to establish mental health care are likely to miss 5 individuals in need as seen at Northwestern University, where 110 residents and fellows felt they 6 would benefit from mental health care, but less than half sought m edical treatment14; and 7 8 Whereas, Resident physicians face barriers to accessing mental health assessments including 9 cost, time, stigma, and pervasive cultures of stoicism, even when mental health services are 10 available and free, resulting in low utilizati on15; and 11 12 Whereas, Opt -out/auto -enrollment strategy refers to when \"a preferred behavior occurs 13 automatically but can be disregarded,\" contrary to opt -in/self -referral strategy where \"active steps 14 must be taken to perform a preferred behavior\"16; and 15 16 Whereas, Opt -out strategy makes target behavior more likely by conveying a sense of normalcy18 17 and leveraging status -quo bias, \"a preference for familiarity where people tend to resist chance 18 and prefer the current state of affairs\"17; and 19 20 Whereas, Previous studies comparing opt -out versus opt -in methods showed opt -out strategies 21 significantly increased participation across various domains, including COVID -19 surveillance 22 testing (opt -out screening had 5.1% increased testing compared to opt -in)18, HIV testin g (opt -out 23 screening had 12% increased uptake compared to opt -in)19, and colorectal screening (opt -out 24 screening had 19.5% increase screening than opt -in)20; and 25 26 Whereas, Annual opt -out mental health screenings can mitigate cost, time, and stigma barrier s by 27 offering \"access to a no -cost evaluation in the same location and contiguous with workday time 28 slots where trainees will not have to sacrifice personal time and funds to obtain evaluation\"21; and 29 30 Whereas, Opt -out mental health program implemented in West Virginia University (WVU) found 31 that postgraduate year 1 (PGY -1) and PGY -2 resident physicians showed a 93% attendance in 32 auto- enrolled wellness appointments, of which a majority mentioned they were \"likely to return for 33 future visits if they had conc erns about depression, anxiety, and burnout\"22; and 34 35 Whereas, Opt -out mental health screening implemented in WVU used \"wellness days\" biannually 36 where residents who participated were not required to come to work, were not required to use 37 sick/personal/vacation days, and did not bear any personal cost22; and 38 39 Whereas, Opt -out mental health screening implemented in WVU were scheduled 1 hour visits with 40 a licensed therapist with experience with residents where all information obtained confidential (not 41 shared with administration) and stored in a separate electronic health record system22; and 42 43 Whereas, 85% of internal medicine and internal medicine- pediatrics residents participating in an 44 opt-out mental health program at the University of Colorado (UC) agreed the program should 45 continue in the future, with the majority of interns feeling that the program positively affected their 46 wellness regardless of whether they attended the appointment23; and 47 48 Whereas, Opt -out mental health screening implemented at UC provided \"half -days\" for interns 49 where students could take off half of a clinic day to meet with an in -house mental health provider, 50 or opt -out and still take off half of a clinic day23; and 51 Resolution: 307 (A-23) Page 3 of 7 Whereas, Opt -out mental health screening implemented at UC was provided at no personal cost to 1 the interns and all information obtained was kept confidential23; ther efore be it 2 3 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association policy H- 295.858, \" Access to Confidential 4 Health Services for Medical Students and Physicians ,\" be amended by addition and deletion to 5 read as follows: 6 7 Access to Confidential Health Services for Medical Students 8 and Physicians H -295.858 9 1. Our AMA will ask the Liaison Committee on Medical Education, Commission on 10 Osteopathic College Accreditation, American Osteopathic Association, and 11 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education to encourage medical 12 schools and residency/fellowship programs, respectively, to: 13 A. Provide or facilitate the immediate availability of urgent and emergent access to 14 low-cost, confidential health care, including mental health and substance use 15 disorder counseling services, that: 16 (1) include appropriate follow -up; (2) are outside the trainees' grading and 17 evaluation pathways; and (3) are available (based on patient preference and need 18 for assurance of confidentiality) in reasonable proximity to the education/training 19 site, at an external site, or through telemedicine or other virtual, online means; 20 B. Ensure that residency/fellowship programs are abiding by all duty hour 21 restrictions, as these regulations exist in part to ensure the mental and physical 22 health of trainees; 23 C. Encourage and promote routine health screening among medical students and 24 resident/fellow physicians, and consider designating some segment of already - 25 allocated personal time off (if necessary, during scheduled work hours) specifically 26 for routine health screening and preventive services, including physical, mental, and 27 dental care; and 28 D. Remind trainees and practicing physicians to avail themselves of any needed 29 resources, both within and external to their institution, to provide for their mental and 30 physical health and well- being, as a component of their professional obligation to 31 ensure their own fitness for duty and the need to prioritize patient safety and quality 32 of care by ensuring appropriate self -care, not working when sick, and following 33 generally accepted guidelines for a healthy lifestyle. 34 2. Our AMA will urge state medical boards to refrain from asking applicants about 35 past history of mental health or substance use disorder diagnosis or treatment, and 36 only focus on current impairment by mental illness or addiction, and to accept \"safe 37 haven\" non -reporting for physicians seeking licensure or relicensure who are 38 undergoing treatment for mental health or addiction issues, to help ensure 39 confidentiality of such treatment for the individual physician while providing 40 assurance of patient safety. 41 3. Our AMA encourages medical schools undergraduate and graduate medical 42 programs to create mental health and substance abuse awareness and suicide 43 prevention screening programs that would: 44 A. be available to all medical students , residents, and fellows on an opt -out basis 45 B. ensure anonymity, confidentiality, and protection from administrative action; 46 C. provide proactive intervention for identified at -risk students by mental health and 47 addiction professionals; and 48 D. inform students and faculty about personal mental health, substance use and 49 addiction, and other risk factors that may contribute to suicidal ideation. 50 4. Our AMA: (a) encourages state medical boards to consider physical and mental 51 conditions similarly; (b) encourages state medical boards to recognize that the 52 Resolution: 307 (A-23) Page 4 of 7 presence of a mental health condition does not necessarily equate with an impaired 1 ability to practice medicine; and (c) encourages state medical societies to advocate 2 that state medical boards not sanction physicians based solely on the presence of a 3 psychiatric disease, irrespective of treatment or behavior. 4 5. Our AMA: (a) encourages study of medical student mental health, including but 5 not limited to rates and risk factors of depression and suicide; (b) encourages 6 medical schools to confidentially gather and release information regarding reporting 7 rates of depression/suicide on an opt -out basis from its students; and (c) will work 8 with other interested parties to encourage research into identifying and addressing 9 modifiable risk factors for burnout, depression and suicide across the continuum of 10 medical education. 11 6. Our AMA encourages the development of alternative methods for dealing with the 12 problems of student -physici an mental health among medical schools, such as: (a) 13 introduction to the concepts of physician impairment at orientation; (b) ongoing 14 support groups, consisting of students and house staff in various stages of their 15 education; (c) journal clubs; (d) frater nities; (e) support of the concepts of physical 16 and mental well -being by heads of departments, as well as other faculty members; 17 and/or (f) the opportunity for interested students and house staff to work with 18 students who are having difficulty. Our AMA supports making these alternatives 19 available to students at the earliest possible point in their medical education. 20 7. Our AMA will engage with the appropriate organizations to facilitate the 21 development of educational resources and training related to suicide risk of 22 patients, medical students, residents/fellows, practicing physicians, and other health 23 care professionals, using an evidence -based multidisciplinary approach.

and 7 8 Whereas, The DACA policy is on track to become codified as a federal regulation, with a final 9 rule taking effect on October 31, 20222; and 10 11 Whereas, As of March 2022 there are 611,270 DACA recipients in the United States, with an 12 estimate of 1,159,000 considered immediately eligible without actively awarded DACA status; 13 and3 14 15 Whereas, The American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) estimates that over the first 16 eight years since DACA was established, only about 200 DACA -status individuals, 17 representing less than 0.1% of all DACA recipients, have trained in US medical schools and 18 residency programs4; and 19 20 Whereas, For the 2022 -2023 school year, 70 medical institutions are listed on the AAMC 21 website as accepting DACA -status eligible applicants, 5 fewer than in 20204,5; and 22 23 Whereas, Despite institutions knowing what DACA was, only 58% were familiar with their 24 DACA admission policies4; and 25 26 Whereas, The Federal government permits DACA recipients to rotate through medical 27 facilities operated by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and while certain states, 28 including New York and California, have expanded licensure eligibility to include DACA 29 recipients, many states restrict licensure for non -U.S. citizens who are not \"qualified aliens\", 30 excluding DACA recipients from licensure7; and 31 32 Whereas, DACA students have reported acceptance to several institutions only to have their 33 offers rescinded due to their status, despite being transparent about their DACA status from 34 the start of the admission process6; and 35 36 Whereas, DACA -status students are ineligible for Federal Student Aid and must resort to 37 private student loans6; and 38 Resolution: 308 (A-23) Page 2 of 5 Whereas, The median debt of a medical school graduate is $200,000 as of 2020, and there 1 are programs available for loan forgiveness through Public Service Loan Forgiveness, or 2 service to rural communities through the National Health Service Corps Rural Community 3 Loan Repayment Program6; and 4 5 Whereas, DACA recipients are ineligible for such loan forgiveness programs, despite being 6 more likely to serve in underserved and/or rural communities than the general population2,6; 7 and 8 9 Whereas, Less than 10% of schools reserved funds for DACA students, and some required 10 proof of payment for all four years for matriculation4; and 11 12 Whereas, Half of US states allow for public schools to charge DACA students out -of-state 13 tuition, despite eligibility for in -state tuition if documented6; and 14 15 Whereas, DACA recipients are hired through the same procedure as US Citizens or 16 Permanent Residents using the federal I -9 proces s7; and 17 18 Whereas, DACA recipients and their households pay about $5.6 billion annually in federal 19 taxes and about $3.1 billion annually in state and local taxes2; and 20 21 Whereas, DACA individuals are considered resident aliens for federal and state tax 22 purposes, and as such they do not qualify for government assistance programs such as 23 Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Medicaid, Supplemental Security 24 Income (SSI), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), health insurance subsidies 25 under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), or any other federal, state, or local benefit as defined 26 by 8 U.S.C 1611 and 8 U.S.C 16218,9; and 27 28 Whereas, Our American Medical Association supports efforts to increase the applicant pool 29 of qualified minority students (H-3 50.979) ; and 30 31 Whereas, Our AMA supports that medical schools should be explicit in publications of their 32 admissions requirements and the methods they employ in the selection of students (H - 33 295.995); and 34 35 Whereas, Our AMA supports the efforts of the AAMC increasing transparency in the medical 36 school application process for international students (H -255.968); and 37 38 Whereas, Our AMA has no policy encouraging medical schools to provide transparency on 39 admissions requirements in the selection of DACA eligible applicants; and 40 41 Whereas, Our AMA supports legislation that provides targeted financial aid to financially 42 disadvantaged students at both collegiate and medical school levels (H -350.979); and 43 44 Whereas, There currently exists no similar policy for DACA- eligible medical school 45 applicant s; and 46 47 Whereas, During the COVID -19 pandemic over 200,000 DACA recipients were working 48 essential positions, at least 29,000 of whom were healthcare workers10; and 49 Resolution: 308 (A-23) Page 3 of 5 Whereas, DACA healthcare workers increase diversity of the medical field and contribute to 1 the learning of fellow medical students to the culture of immigrant patients, broadening 2 access to care for underserved populations11;

and 2 3 Whereas, Legacy admissions date back to the 1920s when they were established to protect 4 universities' white, wealthy and Protestant applicants from competing with recent European 5 and Jewish immigrants1; and 6 7 Whereas, Legacy admissions continue today to significantly favor the admission of white, 8 wealthy applicants, with nearly 70% of legacy applicants to Harvard identifying as white3; and 9 10 Whereas, 75% of the nation's major research universities and elite liberal arts college - 11 including their medical schools - factor legacy status into the decision to admit or reject an 12 applicant4; and 13 14 Whereas, 42% of private institutions - including most of the nation's elite institutions - use 15 legacy admissions5,6; and 16 17 Whereas, Admissions data are tightly kept university secrets and ascertaining information on 18 how legacy admissions factor into the admissions process is extremely difficult5; and 19 20 Whereas, The advantage awarded by legacy status can be stark, with one study estimating 21 that legacy status provides an undergraduate applicant with the equivalent of 160 extra 22 points on the SAT and another indicating that legacy applicants are admitted at the rate of 23 more than five times non -legacy applicants7,8; and 24 25 Whereas, In 2014, Johns Hopkins University removed legacy as a factor in admissions in 26 efforts to increase its student diversity, and subsequently from 2009 to 2019, Pell Grant 27 eligible students increased by 10%, students on financial aid increased by more than 20%, 28 and minority students increased by 10%9; and 29 30 Whereas, Johns Hopkins University attributes ending legacy admissions with building a more 31 diverse student body10; and 32 33 Whereas, Johns Hopkins University in 2014 and Amherst College in 2021 recently ended 34 their legacy policies11,12; and 35 36 Whereas, Colorado banned public colleges and universities from considering legacy status in 37 the admissions process based on the conviction that providing preferential treatment to 38 students with familial relationships to alumni is discriminatory13; and 39 Resolution: 309 (A-23) Page 2 of 6 Whereas, Legislation has been introduced in Congress that ends federal funding for 1 universities that employ legacy admissions due to their ability to exacerbate racial and 2 economic inequalities14; and 3 4 Whereas, The ACLU has called for an end to legacy admissions in order to help address 5 long- standing disparities and inequality in higher education while increasing access for 6 underrepresented students15; and 7 8 Whereas, A bill was introduced by state lawmakers in New York and Connecticut in 2022 to 9 bar public and private colleges from using legacy admissions due to the impact on low 10 income students and underrepresented communities16; and 11 12 Whereas, Some e xperts on race, inequity , and social policy believe that legacy admissions 13 limit access for medium and low- income students as well as African American, Latino, and 14 Native American students and indefensibly provide special access to higher education to the 15 most privileged17,18; and 16 17 Whereas, Physicians' children are 24x more likely to become physicians than their peers 18 making it the most inherited career requiring higher education19; and 19 20 Whereas, The most common occupation for a wealthy person, i.e. the nation's 1% of top 21 earners, is medical doctor20; and 22 23 Whereas, Applicants, especially those not from medical or privileged backgrounds, face 24 numerous barriers to entry in medical school; and 25 26 Whereas, Legacy admissions have been shown to limit social mobility, making it harder for 27 disadvantaged students such as those without resources or knowledge to gain admission15; 28 and 29 30 Wher eas, The University of Arizona College of Medicine guarantees an interview for legacy 31 applicants - those who have a sibling, parent or grandparent who graduated from the 32 University of Arizona College of Medicine - a privilege it offers to only 6.6% of non- legacy 33 applicants21,22; and 34 35 Whereas, Most medical schools \"have some sort of legacy process in place,\" per the 36 University of Arizona College of Medicine's executive director of admissions21; and 37 38 Whereas, Tufts University School of Medicine in April of 2021 eliminated its use of legacy 39 admissions in response to its anti- racism initiative23; and 40 41 Whereas, The AAMC recognizes the impact of racism on all aspects of medicine, including 42 \"inequitable admissions practices\"24; and 43 44 Whereas, The American Medical As sociation released a strategic plan in 2021 to dismantle 45 structural racism, address the historical inequities that marginalized populations have faced, 46 and \"pivot from ambivalence to urgent action [...] and from lack of accountability to an active 47 embrace of equity as a core mission and strategy\"25,26; and 48 Resolution: 309 (A-23) Page 3 of 6 Whereas, Policy H -65.952 states that AMA recognizes racism as a serious threat to public 1 health and supports the development of policies that combat racism and its effects, but does 2 not oppose the use of legacy admissions27, and 3 4 Whereas, Policy H- 200.951 states that the AMA encourages medical school policies that 5 promote diversity and include underrepresented individuals in medicine, but does not oppose 6 the use of legacy admissions, which have been shown to limit racial and socioeconomic 7 diversity28; and 8 9 Whereas, Policy H -350.970 states that the AMA will work with stakeholders to promote 10 programs that are aimed at increasing minority medical student admissions, but does not 11 recognize that the lack of a stance against legacy admissions con tradicts this policy29; and 12 13 Whereas, Policy H -295.888 states that the AMA encourages medical schools to give weight 14 to personal qualities (such as empathy, integrity, commitment to service) during the 15 admissions process, but does not have a policy stating legacy admissions are not one of the 16 personal qualities that should be considered30; and 17 18 Whereas, Policy H -295.998 reaffirms the Liaison Committee on Medical Education's policy 19 about establishing effective policies and procedures in regards to medical school admissions, 20 but does not recognize that preferential legacy admissions policies fail to guarantee an 21 equitable admissions process and therefore current policies and procedures are not 22 effective31; and 23 24 Whereas, Legacy admissions are incompatible with the AMA's current plan to dismantle 25 structural racism by perpetuating socioeconomic and racial disparities across medical 26 institutions; therefore be it 27 28 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association recognize that legacy admissions are 29 rooted in discriminatory practices (New HOD Policy) ; and be it further 30 31 RESOLVED, That our AMA oppose the use of legacy status as a screening tool for medical 32 school admissions (New HOD Policy) ; and be it further 33 34 RESOLVED, That our AMA study the prevalence and impact of legacy status in medical 35 school admissions.

Our AMA acknowledges that, although the primary drivers of racial health inequity are systemic and structural racism, racism and unconscious bias within medical research and health care delivery have caused and continue to cause harm to marginalized communities and society as a whole. 2. Our AMA recognizes racism, in its systemic, cultural, interpersonal, and other forms, as a serious threat to public health, to the advancement of health equity, and a barrier to appropriate medical care. 3. Our AMA encourages the development, implementation, and evaluation of undergraduate, graduate, and continuing med ical education programs and curricula that engender greater understanding of: (a) the causes, influences, and effects of systemic, cultural, institutional, and interpersonal racism; and (b) how to prevent and ameliorate the health effects of racism. 4. Our AMA: (a) supports the development of policy to combat racism and its effects; and (b) encourages governmental agencies and nongovernmental organizations to increase funding for research into the epidemiology of risks and damages related to racism and how to prevent or repair them. 5. Our AMA will work to prevent and combat the influences of racism and bias in innovative health technologies. Citation: Res. 5, I -20; Reaffirmed: Res. 013, A -22; Modified: Speakers Rep., A -22; Diversity in Medical Education H-350.970 Our AMA will: (1) request that the AMA Foundation seek ways of supporting innovative programs that strengthen pre- medical and pre- college preparation for minority students; (2) support and work in partnership with local state and specialty medica l societies and other relevant groups to provide education on and promote programs aimed at increasing the number of minority medical school admissions; applicants who are admitted; and (3) encourage medical schools to consider the likelihood of service to underserved populations as a medical school admissions criterion.

Our AMA encourages: (A) research on ways to reliably evaluate the personal qualities (such as empathy, integrity, commitment to service) of applicants to medical school and support broad dissemination of the results. Medical schools should be encouraged to give significant weight to these qualities in the admissions process; (B) premedical coursework in the humanities, behavioral sciences, and social sciences, as a way to ensure a broadly -educated applicant pool; and (C) dissemination of models that allow medical sc hools to meet their goals related to diversity in the context of existing legal requirements, for example through outreach to elementary schools, high schools, and colleges.

The medical school makes available to all interested parties its criter ia, standards, policies, and procedures regarding these matters.\" (2) In addition, to clarify and protect the rights of medical students, the AMA recommends that: (a) Each school develop and publish in its catalog, student handbook or similar publication t he institutional policies and procedures both for evaluation of academic performance (promotion, graduation, dismissal, probation, remedial work, and the like) and for nonacademic disciplinary decisions. (b) These policies and procedures should define the responsible bodies and their function and membership, provide for timely progressive verbal and written notification to the student that his/her academic/nonacademic performance is in question, and provide an opportunity for the student to learn why it has been questioned. (c) These policies and procedures should also ensure that when a student has been notified of recommendations by the responsible committee for nonadvancement or dismissal, he/she has adequate notice and the opportunity to appear before the decision- making body to respond to the data submitted and introduce his/her own data. (d) The student should be allowed to be accompanied by a student or faculty advisor. (e) The policies and procedures should include an appeal mechanism within the medic al school. (f) The student should be allowed to continue in the academic program during the proceedings unless extraordinary circumstances exist, such as physical threat to others. Citation: CME Rep.

RELEVANT AMA POLICY Principles of and Actions to Address Medical Education Costs and Student Debt H- 305.925 The costs of medical education should never be a barrier to the pursuit of a career in medicine nor to the decision to practice in a given specialty. To help address this issue, our American Medical Association (AMA) will: 1. Collaborate with members of the Federation and the medical education community, and with other interested organizations, to address the cost of medical education and medical student debt through public - and private- sector advocacy. 2. Vigorously advocate for and support expansion of and adequate funding for federal scholarship and loan repayment programs --such as those from the National Health Service Corps, Indian Health Service, Armed Forces, and Department of Veterans Affairs, and for comparable programs from states and the private sector --to promote practice in underserved areas, the military, and academic medicine or clinical research. 3. Encourage the expansion of National Institutes of Health programs that provide loan repayment in exchange for a commitment to conduct targeted research. 4. Advocate for increased funding for the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program to assure adequate funding of primary care within the National Health Service Corps, as well as to permit: (a) inclusion of all medical specialties in need, and (b) service in clinical settings that care for the underserved but are not necessarily located in health professions shortage areas. 5. Encourage the National Health Service Corps to have repayment policies that are consistent with other federal loan forgiveness programs, thereby decreasing the amount of loans in default and increasing the number of physicians practicing in underserved areas. 6. Work to reinstate the economic hardship deferment qualification criterion known as the \"20/220 pathway,\" and support alternate mechanisms that better address the financial needs of trainees with educational debt. 7. Advocate for federal legislation to support the creation of student loan savings accounts that allow for pre-tax dollars to be used to pay for student loans. 8. Work with other concerned organizations to advocate for legislation and regulation that would result in favorable terms and conditions for borrowing and for loan repayment, and would permit 100% tax deductibility of interest on student loans and elimination of taxes on aid from service- based programs. 9. Encourage the creation of private- sector financial aid programs with favorable interest rates or service obligations (such as community - or institution- based loan repayment programs or state medical society loan programs). 10. Support stabl e funding for medical education programs to limit excessive tuition increases, and collect and disseminate information on medical school programs that cap medical education debt, including the types of debt management education that are provided. 11. Work with state medical societies to advocate for the creation of either tuition caps or, if caps are not feasible, pre- defined tuition increases, so that medical students will be aware of their tuition and fee costs for the total period of their enrollment. 12. Encourage medical schools to (a) Study the costs and benefits associated with non- traditional instructional formats (such as online and distance learning, and combined baccalaureate/MD or DO programs) to determine if cost savings to medical schools and to medical students could be realized without jeopardizing the quality of medical education; (b) Engage in fundraising activities to increase the availability of scholarship support, with the support of the Federation, medical schools, and state and special ty medical societies, and develop or enhance financial aid opportunities for medical students, such as self -managed, low -interest loan programs; (c) Cooperate with postsecondary institutions to establish collaborative debt counseling for entering first -year medical students; (d) Allow for flexible scheduling for Resolution: 311 (A-23) Page 4 of 5 medical students who encounter financial difficulties that can be remedied only by employment, and consider creating opportunities for paid employment for medical students; (e) Counsel individual me dical student borrowers on the status of their indebtedness and payment schedules prior to their graduation; (f) Inform students of all government loan opportunities and disclose the reasons that preferred lenders were chosen; (g) Ensure that all medical s tudent fees are earmarked for specific and well -defined purposes, and avoid charging any overly broad and ill -defined fees, such as but not limited to professional fees; (h) Use their collective purchasing power to obtain discounts for their students on necessary medical equipment, textbooks, and other educational supplies; (i) Work to ensure stable funding, to eliminate the need for increases in tuition and fees to compensate for unanticipated decreases in other sources of revenue; mid- year and retroactive tuition increases should be opposed. 13. Support and encourage state medical societies to support further expansion of state loan repayment programs, particularly those that encompass physicians in non- primary care specialties. 14. Take an active advocacy role during reauthorization of the Higher Education Act and similar legislation, to achieve the following goals: (a) Eliminating the single holder rule; (b) Making the availability of loan deferment more flexible, including broadening the definition of ec onomic hardship and expanding the period for loan deferment to include the entire length of residency and fellowship training; (c) Retaining the option of loan forbearance for residents ineligible for loan deferment; (d) Including, explicitly, dependent care expenses in the definition of the \"cost of attendance\"; (e) Including room and board expenses in the definition of tax -exempt scholarship income; (f) Continuing the federal Direct Loan Consolidation program, including the ability to \"lock in\" a fixed interest rate, and giving consideration to grace periods in renewals of federal loan programs; (g) Adding the ability to refinance Federal Consolidation Loans; (h) Eliminating the cap on the student loan interest deduction; (i) Increasing the income limits f or taking the interest deduction; (j) Making permanent the education tax incentives that our AMA successfully lobbied for as part of Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001; (k) Ensuring that loan repayment programs do not place greater b urdens upon married couples than for similarly situated couples who are cohabitating; (l) Increasing efforts to collect overdue debts from the present medical student loan programs in a manner that would not interfere with the provision of future loan funds to medical students. 15. Continue to work with state and county medical societies to advocate for adequate levels of medical school funding and to oppose legislative or regulatory provisions that would result in significant or unplanned tuition increases . 16. Continue to study medical education financing, so as to identify long- term strategies to mitigate the debt burden of medical students, and monitor the short -and long- term impact of the economic environment on the availability of institutional and ext ernal sources of financial aid for medical students, as well as on choice of specialty and practice location. 17. Collect and disseminate information on successful strategies used by medical schools to cap or reduce tuition. 18. Continue to monitor the availability of and encourage medical schools and residency/fellowship programs to (a) provide financial aid opportunities and financial planning/debt management counseling to medical students and resident/fellow physicians; (b) work with key stakeholders to develop and disseminate standardized information on these topics for use by medical students, resident/fellow physicians, and young physicians; and (c) share innovative approaches with the medical education community. 19. Seek federal legislation or rule c hanges that would stop Medicare and Medicaid decertification of physicians due to unpaid student loan debt. The AMA believes that it is improper for physicians not to repay their educational loans, but assistance should be available to those physicians who are experiencing hardship in meeting their obligations. 20. Related to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program, our AMA supports increased medical student and physician participation in the program, and will: (a) Advocate that all resident/fell ow physicians have access to PSLF during their training years; (b) Advocate against a monetary cap on PSLF and other federal loan forgiveness programs; (c) Work with the United States Department of Education to ensure that any cap on loan forgiveness under PSLF be at least equal to the principal amount borrowed; (d) Ask the United States Department of Education to include all terms of PSLF in the contractual obligations of the Master Promissory Note; (e) Encourage the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medi cal Education (ACGME) to require residency/fellowship programs to include within the terms, conditions, and benefits of program appointment information on the employer's PSLF program qualifying status; (f) Advocate that the profit status of a physician's t raining institution not be a factor for PSLF eligibility; (g) Encourage medical school financial advisors to counsel wise borrowing by medical Resolution: 311 (A-23) Page 5 of 5 students, in the event that the PSLF program is eliminated or severely curtailed; (h) Encourage medical school fi nancial advisors to increase medical student engagement in service- based loan repayment options, and other federal and military programs, as an attractive alternative to the PSLF in terms of financial prospects as well as providing the opportunity to provi de care in medically underserved areas; (i) Strongly advocate that the terms of the PSLF that existed at the time of the agreement remain unchanged for any program participant in the event of any future restrictive changes; (j) Monitor the denial rates for physician applicants to the PSLF; (k) Undertake expanded federal advocacy, in the event denial rates for physician applicants are unexpectedly high, to encourage release of information on the basis for the high denial rates, increased transparency and str eamlining of program requirements, consistent and accurate communication between loan servicers and borrowers, and clear expectations regarding oversight and accountability of the loan servicers responsible for the program; (l) Work with the United States Department of Education to ensure that applicants to the PSLF and its supplemental extensions, such as Temporary Expanded Public Service Loan Forgiveness (TEPSLF), are provided with the necessary information to successfully complete the program(s) in a timely manner; and (m) Work with the United States Department of Education to ensure that individuals who would otherwise qualify for PSLF and its supplemental extensions, such as TEPSLF, are not disqualified from the program(s). 21. Advocate for continued funding of programs including Income- Driven Repayment plans for the benefit of reducing medical student load burden. 22. Strongly advocate for the passage of legislation to allow medical students, residents and fellows who have education loans to qualify for interest -free deferment on their student loans while serving in a medical internship, residency, or fellowship program, as well as permitting the conversion of currently unsubsidized Stafford and Graduate Plus loans to interest free status for the duration of undergraduate and graduate medical education. Citation: CME Report 05, I -18; Appended: Res. 953, I Appended: 316, A - 19; Appended: Res. 226, A -21; Reaffirmed in lieu of: Res. 311, A -21; Modified: CME Rep. 4, I -21; Reaffirmation: A -22; AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 312 (A-23) Introduced by: Medical Student Section Subject: Indian Health Service Licensing Exemptions Referred to: Reference Committee C Whereas, The Indian Health Service (IHS) is responsible for providing direct and indirect 1 healthcare services to nearly 3 million American Indians and Alaska Natives in the United 2 States1; and 3 4 Whereas, Compared to other federal health programs like Medicaid, Medicare, and the 5 Veterans' Health Administration, the IHS is unique in that it serves members of federally 6 recognized American Indian and Alaska Native Tribes and Villages1; and 7 8 Whereas, There are three types of healthcare facilities under the umbrella of the IHS: federal or 9 IHS (I) facilities operated by the federal government, and tribal (T) and urban (U) Indian health 10 programs which are operated under the authority and support of the Indian Self -Determination 11 and Education Assistance Act of 1975 (ISDEAA) (Public Law 93- 638) and Indian Health Care 12 Improvement Act (Public Law 94- 437)3,4; and 13 14 Whereas, These facilities are operated through compacts and contracts with federally - 15 recognized American Indian and Alaska Native Tribes and Villages and nonprofit Indian 16 healthcare organizations3,4; and 17 18 Whereas, The Affordable Care Act established that licensed health professionals employed by a 19 Tribal health program shall be exempt, if licensed in any state, from the licensing requirement of 20 the state in which the Tribal health program performs the services described in the contract or 21 compact of the Tribal health program under the authority of ISDE AA5; and 22 23 Whereas, Current federal law defines a \"[T]ribal health program\" as an Indian Tribe or Tribal 24 organization that operates any health program, service, function, activity, or facility funded, in 25 whole or part, by the Indian Health Service5; and 26 27 Whereas, In 2012, California Governor Jerry Brown signed Assembly Bill 1896 (AB 1896), 28 which codified the federal licensing requirement specifying that a person who is licensed as a 29 health care practitioner in any other state and is employed by a Tribal health program is exempt 30 from the respective state's licensing requirements with respect to acts authorized under the 31 person's license where the Tribal health program performs specific services, in order to help 32 align state law with federal law, make it easier to hire healthcare professionals, and fill 33 longstanding I/T/U vacancies6,7; and 34 35 Whereas, In 2015, California Governor Jerry Brown took up a similar issue and signed 36 Assembly Bill 941 (AB 941) which allowed for a clinic conducted, maintained, or operated by a 37 federally recognized Indian tribe under a contract with the United States pursuant to federal law, 38 without regard to the location of the clinic, to be exempt from licensing provisions from the State 39 Department of Public Health8; and 40 Resolution: 312 (A-23) Page 2 of 3 Whereas, During the 111th Congress, the Rahall Amendment was added to H.R. 3200: 1 America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009 to preserve the federal trust responsibility to 2 provide health care to American Indians and Alaska Natives and to protect the Indian Health 3 Service from inadvertent harm9; and 4 5 Whereas, Sec. 225 of H.R. 3200 barred any health care provider not licensed or certified under 6 State law from participating in the public health insurance option and because federal (IHS) and 7 Tribal facilities are not subject to state licensing laws, as written, Sec. 225 would have barred all 8 of these facilities from participation in a public health insurance option9; and 9 10 Whereas, This provides another example of why I/T/U licensing and related exemptions should 11 be considered when discussing the merits of healthcare legislation, similar to what was 12 presented by AB 1896 and AB 941 in California9; and 13 14 Whereas, The IHS has active policy to address the possibility that state licensing exemptions for 15 healthcare providers at I/T/U facilities may create \"blindspots\" allowing for physicians and other 16 healthcare professionals to practice with a restricted state license in a state not concordant with 17 their license10; and 18 19 Whereas, Without knowledge of federal statutes regarding licensing of IHS physicians and 20 facilities, state health agencies may create unnecessary burdens for filling IHS physician 21 vacancies, which average between 25 to 50 percent across the country, and licensing new 22 facilities11; therefore be it 23 24 RESOLVED, T hat our American Medical Association advocate that physicians at Indian Health 25 Service, Tribal, and Urban Indian Health Programs be exempt from duplicative licensure 26 requirements, such as requirements for state licensure when these physicians are already 27 federally licensed (Directive to Take Action); and be it further 28 29 RESOLVED, That our AMA advocate that future health reform proposals include corresponding 30 licensure and eligibility exceptions for Indian Health Service, Tribal, and Urban Indian Health 31 Progr am facilities and physicians to ensure that these physicians can fully participate.

The AMA specifically recommends: (1) Indian Population: (a) In current education programs, and in the expansion of educational activities suggested below, special consideration be given to involving the American Indian and Alaska native population in training for the various health professions, in the expectation that such professionals, if provided with adequate professional resources, facilities, and income, will be more likely to serve the tribal areas permanently; (b) Exploration with American Indian leaders of the possibility of increased numbers of nonfederal American Indian health centers, under tribal sponsorship, to expand the American Indian role in its own health care; (c) Increased involvement of private practitioners and facilities in American Indian care, through such mechanisms as agreements with tribal leaders or Indian Health Service contracts, as well as normal private practice relationships; and (d) Improvement in transportation to make access to existing private care easier for the American Indian population. (2) Federal Facilities : Based on the distribution of the eligible population, transportation facilities and roads, and the availability of alternative nonfederal resources, the AMA recommends that those Indian Health Service facilities currently necessary for American Indian care be identified and that an i mmediate construction and modernization program be initiated to bring these facilities up to current standards of practice and accreditation. (3)Manpower : (a) Compensation for Indian Health Service physicians be increased to a level competitive with other Federal agencies and nongovernmental service; (b) Consideration should be given to increased compensation for service in remote areas; (c) In conjunction with improvement of Service facilities, efforts should be made to establish closer ties with teaching centers, thus increasing both the available manpower and the level of professional expertise available for consultation; (d) Allied health professional staffing of Service facilities should be maintained at a level appropriate to the special needs of the population served; (e) Continuing education opportunities should be provided for those health professionals serving these communities, and especially those in remote areas, and, increased peer contact, both to maintain the quality of care and to avert professional isolation; and (f) Consideration should be given to a federal statement of policy supporting continuation of the Public Health Service to reduce the great uncertainty now felt by many career officers of the corps. (4)Medical Societies : In those states where Indian Health Service facilities are located, and in counties containing or adjacent to Service facilities, that the appropriate medical societies should explore the possibility of increased formal liaison with local Indian Health Service physicians. Increased support from organized medicine for improvement of health care provided under their direction, including professional consultation and involvement in society activities should be pursued. (5) Our AMA also support the removal of any requirement for competitive bidding in the Indian Health Service that compromises proper care for the American Indian population.

Fryhofer, MD, Chair Referred to: Reference Committee D BACKGROUND 1 2 Policy D-440.922, \"Full Commitment by our AMA to the Betterment and Strengthening of Public 3 Health Systems \" adopted by House of Delegates (HOD) at I-21 directed our American Medical 4 Association (AMA) to: 5 6 develop an organization- wide strategy on public health including ways in which the 7 AMA can strengthen the health and public health system infrastructure and report 8 back regularly on progress . 9 10 Policy D-135.966, \"Declaring Climate Change a Public Health Crisis ,\" adopted by the 11 House of Delegates at A-22 directed our AMA to: 12 13 develop a strategic plan for how we will enact our climate change policies including 14 advocacy priorities and strategies to decarbonize physician practices and the health 15 sector with report back to the House of Delegates at the 2023 Annual Meeting. 16 17 Resolution 605- A-22, \" Fulfilling Medicine's Social Contract with Humanity in the Face 18 of the Climate Health Crisis \" was referred by the House of Delegates and asked the AMA 19 to: 20 21 establish a climate crisis campaign that will distribute evidence -based information on 22 the relationship between climate change and human health, determine high -yield 23 advocacy and leadership opportunities for physicians, and centralize our AMA's 24 efforts towards environmental justice and an equitable transition to a net-zero carbon 25 society by 2050. 26 27 Policy D-145.992, \"Further Action to Respond to the Gun Violence Public Health Crisis \" 28 has also called for the AMA to: 29 30 report annually to the House of Delegates on our AMA's efforts relating to 31 legislation, regulation, and litigation at the federal, state, and local levels to prevent 32 gun violence. 33 34 Given the number of requests from the HOD for ongoing reports on public health -related 35 topics as well as large national campaigns , the Board of Truste es is taking this 36 opportunity to outline the AMA's work in public health, so the HOD has clarity on 37 B of T Rep. 17 -A-23 -- page 2 of 19 current efforts and priorities . Our intent is to provide regular updates on the status of this 1 work to the HOD. 2 3 METHODS 4 5 This report is informed semi -structured, in-depth interviews with public health and 6 physician experts (n=17) , members of the AMA Board of Trustees (n=11) , and members 7 of the AMA's Senior Management Group (n=11). Public health experts had federal, state, 8 and local public health experience and were affiliated with governmental public health 9 organizations, national public health organizations, schools of public health, public health 10 foundations, and national medical specialty societies. Stakeholder organizations were 11 identified by the members of the Council on Science and Public Health (CSAPH). 12 Members of the AMA Board of Trustees were asked to participate in interviews at the 13 discretion of the Board Chair. Members of the Senior Management Group were identified 14 based on whether they reported that their work involves public health. 15 16 What is Public Health ? 17 18 Since its founding in 1847, the AMA's mission has been \"to promote the art and science 19 of medicine and the betterment of public health. \" Through the course of the interviews 20 conducted across stakeholders, it was clear that there are many different definitions and 21 understanding of what public health is. 22 23 According to the World Health Organization (WHO) public health is \"the art and science 24 of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health through the organized efforts 25 of society .\" i Public health promotes and protects the health of people and the 26 communities where they live, learn, work and play.ii Public health practice is a different 27 field than clinical medicine with different motivating values, responsibilities, and goals.iii 28 While a doctor treats people who are sick, those working in public health try to prevent 29 people from getting sick or injured in the first place. A public health professional's duty 30 is to the community rather than an individual patient. 31 32 Connection with Health Equity 33 34 It is important to acknowledge that health equity is a central concept in public health and 35 is essential to improving the health of populations. The WHO defines health equity as the 36 \"absence of unfair and avoidable or remediable differences in health among social 37 groups.\"iv It calls for just opportunities, conditions, resources and power for all people to 38 be as healthy as possible. Public health interventions and policies aim to reduce health 39 disparities and are essential for promoting health equity and improving the health of 40 entire populations. O pportunities and resources for health are inequitably distributed, 41 public health seeks to right this inequity. 42 43 The AMA's health equity strategy recognizes that structural and social drivers of health 44 inequities shape a person's and community's capacity to make healthy choices , noting 45 that downstr eam opportunities provided by the health care system and individual -level 46 factors are estimated to only contribute 20 percent to an individual's overall health and 47 well-being, while upstream opportunities of public health and its structural and social 48 drivers account for 80 percent of impact on health outcomes.v 49 50 B of T Rep. 17 -A-23 -- page 3 of 19 The five strategic approaches of the health equity strategy are highly relevant to the 1 AMA's public health work and include: 2 3 1. Embed racial and social justice throughout the AMA enterprise culture, systems, 4 policies and practices. 5 2. Build alliances and share power with historically marginalized and minoritized 6 physicians and other stakeholders. 7 3. Push upstream to address all determinants of health and the root causes of 8 inequities. 9 4. Ensure equitable structures and opportunities in innovation. 10 5. Foster pathways for truth, racial healing, reconciliation and transformation for the 11 AMA's past. 12 13 The AMA already develops an annual report on health equity activities . While integral to the 14 AMA's public health strategy, progress towards the health equity strategy will continue to be 15 reported in the BOT 's annual health equity report. (See BOT 10-A-23, \" Center for Health Equity 16 Annual Report .\") 17 18 CURRENT AMA APPROACHES TO PREVENTION & PUBLIC HEALTH 19 20 1. Promote evidence -based clinical and community preventive services. 21 22 Clinical preventive services involve the care provided by physicians and other health care 23 professionals during a routine one-to-one encounter.vi They have a strong evidence base for 24 efficacy in health improvement and/or cost-effectiveness. These services are not public health, but 25 rather clinical care. However, they are included here because they are necessary to achieve the 26 goals of public health. Community preventive services are evidence -based options that decision 27 makers and affected community members can consider when determining what best meets the 28 specific needs, preferences, available resources, and constraints of their jurisdictions and 29 const ituents .vii They are not oriented to a single patient or all of the patients within a practice. The 30 target is an entire population or subpopulation usually identified by a geographic area.viii 31 32 A. Serve as a liaison to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) , the Advisory 33 Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) , and the Community Preventive Services Task 34 Force (CPSTF) and support the dissemination of recommendations to physicians. 35 36 The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) is an independent, volunteer panel of national 37 experts in disease prevention and evidence -based medicine. The Task Force works to improve the 38 health of people nationwide by making evidence- based recommendations about clinical preventive 39 services. The AMA is USPSTF Dissemination and Implementation (D&I) partner , through which 40 we contribute expertise by helping disseminate the work of the task force to physician members to 41 help put the recommendations into practice.ix Partners are also a powerful vehicle for ensuring the 42 U.S. primary care workforce remains up to date on USPSTF recommendations. 43 44 The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) comprises medical and public health 45 experts who develop recommendations on the use of vaccines in the civilian population of the 46 United States. The recommendations stand as public health guidance for safe use of vaccines and 47 related biological products. In addition to the voting members, there are 30 non- voting 48 representatives from professional organizatio ns, including the AMA, that are highly regarded in the 49 health field.x These members comment on ACIP's recommendations and offer the perspectives of 50 groups that will implement the recommendations. 51 B of T Rep. 17 -A-23 -- page 4 of 19 The Community Preventive Services Task Force (CPSTF) is an independent, non -federal panel 1 whose members are appointed by the CDC Director. CPSTF members represent a broad range of 2 research, practice, and policy expertise in prevention, wellness, health promotion, and public 3 health. The CPSTF was convened in 1996 by the Department of Health and Human Services 4 (HHS) to identify community preventive programs, services, and policies that increase health, 5 longevity, save lives and dollars, and improve Americans ' quality of life. The CPSTF' s 6 recommendations, along with the systematic reviews of the evidence on which they are based, are 7 compiled in the The Community Guide. The AMA serves as an organizational liaison to the 8 CPSTF.xi 9 10 B. Help prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD) by addressing major risk factors (AMA Strategic 11 Priority led by the Improving Health Outcomes Group) 12 13 The AMA is committed to improving the health of the nation and reducing the burden of chronic 14 diseases. In collaboration with health care leaders and organizations, the AMA is developing and 15 disseminating new chronic disease prevention and management approaches. Our primary focus is 16 cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of death in the U.S., accounting for 1 in 4 17 deaths.xii,xiii The AMA engages i n this work through strategic alliances with various organizations 18 including the CDC , the American Heart Association (AHA), and West Side United in Chicago. 19 20 Two major risk factors for CVD are hypertension and type 2 diabetes. An estimated 116 million 21 adults have hypertension and 96 million have prediabetes which can lead to hypertension.xiv,xv, 22 Obesity also leads to the development of cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular disease 23 mortality independently of other cardiovascular risk factors.xvi To help p revent Type 2 diabetes, the 24 AMA developed clinical practice tools that support the screening and managing of people with 25 prediabetes in alignment with clinical guidelines. The AMA also developed AMA MAP BPTM, a 26 clinical quality improvement program that includes population dashboards and reports as well as 27 coaching, training and support for clinical teams. IHO provides the AMA MAP BP program to 28 health care delivery organizations and other collaborators to support improvement in blood 29 pressure control for p atients. The AMA MAPTM framework is expanding to include management 30 for other cardiovascular disease risk factors, including cholesterol, prediabetes, and type 2 diabetes. 31 The AMA is examining how to integrate obesity into its chronic disease portfolio. It completed a 32 landscape assessment to identify existing opportunities and will convene an expert panel to review 33 recommendations from the landscape assessment to provide guidance. 34 35 Additionally, in response to the high prevalence of uncontrolled blood pres sure and to support 36 physicians in managing their patients' high blood pressure, the AMA, in collaboration with the 37 American Heart Association, developed Target: BP , a national initiative offering a series of 38 online resources, using the latest evidence- based information. Target: BP recognizes organizations 39 committed to improving blood pressure control. In 2022, the program recognized 1,309 health care 40 organizations (HCO) for their efforts in representing 49 states or U.S. territories and serving more 41 than 28 million patients, including 8.1 million people with hypertension. 42 43 Black, Latinx, Indigenous, Asian/Pacific Islanders, and other people of color are disproportionally 44 impacted by CVD risk factors and resulting morbidity and mortalities.xvii To better addr ess these 45 disparities the AMA partnered with the American College of Preventive Medicine and Black 46 Women's Health Imperative to increase Black and Latinx women's enrollment in the CDC's 47 National Diabetes Prevention Program lifestyle change program. 48 49 The AM A, along with physician groups and heart health experts, launched the Release the Pressure 50 (RTP) campaign.xviii The campaign has reached over 300,000 Black women, encouraging them to 51 B of T Rep. 17 -A-23 -- page 5 of 19 pledge to \"know your numbers, talk with your doctor, bring your squad,\" in a ddition to training 1 75,000 individuals to track their blood pressure via self -monitoring blood pressure tracking tools. 2 3 C. Collaborate with CDC to improve the implementation of routine screening for HIV, STI, Viral 4 Hepatitis and latent tuberculosis (LTBI ). 5 6 Through funding from the CDC, the AMA has been engaged in work on a project entitled, 7 \"Promoting HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STDs and LTBI Screening in Hospitals, Health Systems and 8 Other Healthcare Settings.\" The scope of this project includes developing, piloting and launching a 9 toolkit that outline s ways to increase routine screening for HIV, STIs, viral hepatitis and latent TB 10 infection. 11 12 As a first phase of this work, the AMA conducted in -depth interviews, virtual clinic visits and co - 13 creation groups with clinicians working in organizations where a well -defined routine screening 14 process is already in place in order to better understand best practices, key challenges and critical 15 considerations when implementing a routine screening program. The findings from these sessions 16 were synthesized and used as the framework to build out the toolkit and its key recommendations. 17 18 The toolkit consists of a series of webpages on the AMA's corporate website. Information and 19 recommendations are organized along the screening and testing continuum and offer helpful 20 resources and best practices from the AMA, CDC and other organizations. The resources include a 21 mix of both implementation and training -related materials for the care team. It is intended to be 22 flexible, allowing an organization to follow along throughout the entire continuum to help improve 23 the end-to-end screening and testing approach or narrow in and focus on a specific stage w here 24 additional guidance and support may be needed. Two versions of the toolkit are being developed\u2014 25 one targeted to community health centers and a second to emergency departments. 26 27 In order to validate the initial iteration of the community health center toolkit that was developed, 28 the AMA conducted a pilot with a cohort of 6 community health centers across the country.xix This 29 work included pilot sites implementing 2-3 toolkit recommendation during the pilot period as well 30 as participating in a series of 5 telementoring sessions with other pilot sites, with each session 31 being focused on a different section of the toolkit. A second pilot to test elements of the toolkit in 32 practice is planned to take place in the spring of 2023 with a cohort of emergency departments. 33 Following these pilots, any feedback and comments received from pilot sites will be prioritized and 34 incorporated into the toolkit before the toolkit is launc hed more broadly. 35 36 D. Promote evidence -based preventive services to the public in collaboration with the Ad Council 37 and other health partners . 38 39 While the AMA's primary audience is physicians, there are limited instances where the AMA has 40 partnered on public information campaigns on select priority issues. This work has been made 41 possible through partnerships with other health -related organizations and the Ad Council. The 42 AMA will explore opportunities for future campaigns on an ongoing basis, with recognition that 43 we have to prioritize our efforts and engaging in these campaigns alone is not feasible due to cost. 44 45 1. Get My Flu Shot 46 47 The Ad Council, AMA, CDC and the CDC Foundation have partnered since the 2020- 2021 flu 48 season through an annual campaign to motivate more people to get vaccinated against seasonal 49 influenza (flu) to protect themselves and their loved ones. During a severe season, flu has resulted 50 in as many as 41 million illnesses and 710,000 hospitalizations among the U.S. population . The Get 51 B of T Rep. 17 -A-23 -- page 6 of 19 My Flu Shot campaign PSAs are launched nationwide to reach people with the message that a flu 1 shot can help you stay healthy, reduce risk of severe outcomes, such as hospitalization and death, 2 and avoid missing work, school, or special moments with family and friends. The campaign ads 3 direct audiences to GetMyFluShot.org for more information, including where to get a flu vaccine in 4 their area. 5 6 2. It's Up to You 7 8 The Ad Council and COVID Collaborative , including the AMA, led a massive communications 9 effort to educate the American public and build confidence around the COVID- 19 vaccines. 10 Guided by the leading minds in science and medicine and fueled by the best talent in the private 11 sector, the COVID- 19 Vaccine Education Initiative is designed to reach different audiences, 12 including communities of color who have been disproportionately affected by COVID -19. Under 13 the umbrella of the \"It's Up to You\" campaign, we worked to ensure that Americans have accurate 14 and timely information to answer their questions and concerns about vaccine side effects, efficacy, 15 and clinical trials. The goal being to shift the public mindset from vaccine concern to vaccine 16 confidence. 17 18 3. Do I have Prediabetes 19 20 More than one in three American adults have prediabetes and are at high risk of developing type 2 21 diabetes \u2014a serious health condition that can lead to heart attack or stroke. Of these individuals, 22 more than 80% of people with prediabetes don't know they have it. However, the vast majority of 23 people with prediabetes can take steps to reduce their risk. Prediabetes can often be reversed 24 through weight loss, diet changes, and increased physical activity. The AMA, in collaboration with 25 the CDC developed a seri es of PSAs encouraging viewers to visit DoIHavePrediabetes.org , where 26 they can take a one -minute risk test to highlight the importance of early diagnosis and speak ing 27 with their physician. Over 12.5M risk tests have been completed since 2016. 28 29 4. Get Down with Your Blood Pressure 30 31 Nearly half of all American adults have high blood pressure, yet only about 1 in 4 individuals have 32 their condition under control. Because of the pandemic and persisting health inequities, there is an 33 increased risk of high blood in communities of color, particularly for Black, Hispanic/Latinx, and 34 Native American adults. The AMA and AHA \"Get Down With Your Blood Pressure\" ca mpaign 35 teaches adults that self -monitoring their blood pressure is as easy as four simple steps: get it, slip it, 36 cuff it, check it. Along with talking to your health care provider about a blood pressure 37 management plan, taking these steps can decrease the incidence of stroke, heart attack, and heart 38 failure. The AMA in collaboration with the AHA maintain both ManageYourBP.org 39 or BajaTuPresion.org which host tools and resources to help educate patients about the how to self - 40 monitor your blood pressure and speak to your health care provider . 41 42 2. Responding to public health crises impacting physicians, patients, and the public. 43 44 The AMA's public health work has also been focused around responding to public health crises. 45 These crises are often associated with significant health risk for patients , raising concerns among 46 physicians. However, these crises are unlikely to be solved in a clinical setting alone. The AMA's 47 response to public health crises are typically focused on (1) ensuring physicians and trainees have 48 the data and resources needed ; (2) identifying evidence -based policies and interventions; (3) 49 elevating the voices of physician leaders through AMA channels and platforms ; and (4) convening 50 and collaborat ing with stakeholders to advance p riority policies and interventions. 51 B of T Rep. 17 -A-23 -- page 7 of 19 1 A. Address the public health crisis of climate change . 2 3 At 2022 Annual M eeting of the House of Delegates, policy was adopted declaring \"climate change 4 a public health crisis that threatens the health and well -being of all individuals.\" At I-22, the 5 Council on Science and Public Health presented a council -initiated report on this topic \"due to the 6 significant public health threat that climate change represents and the impact on the health of 7 patients, with marginalized populations expected to be disproportionately impacted. \" That report 8 noted the health effects of climate change include increased allergies, asthma, respiratory and 9 cardiovascular disease; injuries and premature deaths related to extreme weather events; heat - 10 related deaths due to continued warming; changes in the prevalence and geographical distribution 11 of food - and water -borne illnesses and other infectious diseases, and threats to mental health. The 12 report 's recommendations, which were adopted by the HOD called for a reduc tion in US 13 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions aimed at a 50 percent reduction in emissions by 2030 and carbon 14 neutrality by 2050. In the coming year the AMA's priorities will be as follows: 15 16 1. Educate physicians and trainees on the health effects of climate change. 17 18 The AMA has made climate change education available via the Ed HubTM from a variety of sources 19 including the AMA Journal of Ethics (JOE), the Journal of the American Medical Association 20 (JAMA), and the American Public Health Association (APHA). However, the AMA has not 21 developed a CME module for physicians and trainees on climate change , that will be an area of 22 focus over the coming year. 23 24 2. Identify and disseminate information to physicians on decarbonizing the health care sector and 25 reducing GHG emissions . 26 27 The U.S. health sector account s for 25 percent of global health sector emissions, the highest 28 proportion attributable to any individual country's health sector. The Joint Commission is in the 29 process of convening a technical advisory panel to initiate a directional standard that encourages 30 health systems to address reducing their own carbon footprint, and to review existing standards to 31 be sure, explicitly, that they do not require excess consumption. With the goal of reducing U .S. 32 GHG emissions aimed at a 50 percent reduction in emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 33 2050, the AMA will create a resource page to share information on high -impact actions needed to 34 decarbonize the health care sector. 35 36 There are several resources that already exist including Health Care Without Harm 's Road Map 37 that provides a plan to get health care toward zero emissions.xx The Road Map identifies seven 38 high- impact actions as key to health care decarbonization. Agency for Healthcare Research and 39 Quality (AHRQ) and Institute for Healthcare Improvement 's primer that offers guidance on high- 40 priority measures and strategies for health care organizations to reduce their carbon footprint.xxi 41 The primer describes six domains contributing to GHG emissions in health care: building energy, 42 transportation, anesthetic gas, pharmaceuticals and chemicals, medical devices and supplies, and 43 food. To meaningfully track and reduce GHG emissions, the primer recommends health care 44 organizations should use the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP) framework, a globally recognized 45 standard for quantifying and reporting on emissions. The National Academy of Medicine's Action 46 Collaborative on Decarb onizing the U.S. Health Sector has also hosted a series of Carbon Clinic s 47 designed for health care delivery organizations to learn about carbon accounting. The Carbon 48 Clinics will soon be made public along with related resources. 49 50 3. Elevate the voices of physician leaders on the issue of climate change and health . 51 B of T Rep. 17 -A-23 -- page 8 of 19 1 Through the AMA's video updates and podcast series, we amplif y physician voices and highlight 2 developments and achievements throughout medicine. On January 20, 2022, the AMA featured 3 Renee Salas , MD, MPH, MS, a climate and health expert and emergency medicine physician who 4 discusse d research on the intersection of health and the climate crisis. xxiiixxii On August 25, 2022, the 5 AMA featured Colin Cave, MD, medical director of external affairs, government relations and 6 community health, Northwest Permanente to discuss the link between health and climate change, 7 and how physicians and health systems can be a part of the solutio n. The AMA will continue to 8 look for opportunities to highlight physicians doing this important work. 9 10 4. Collaborate with stakeholders to advance policies and interventions with a unified voice . 11 12 Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health . The AMA will continue to engage in the 13 Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health (Consortium) , which brings together 14 associations representing over 600,000 clinical practitioners to carry three simple messages: 15 16 A. Climate change is harming Americans today and these harms will increase unless we act; 17 B. The way to slow or stop these harms is to decrease the use of fossil fuels and increase 18 energy efficiency and use of clean energy sources; and 19 C. These changes in energy choices will improve the quality of our air and water and bring 20 immediate health benefits.xxiv 21 22 The Consortium recognizes that medical societies have an important opportunity to weigh in to 23 help ensure that the health risks of climate change and the health benefits of climate solutions, 24 especially clean energy, are clearly understood. The voices of America's medical societies have the 25 potential to help reframe the dialogue - putting human health and wellbeing front and center in the 26 conversation. This is especially important to communities who are experiencing a disproportionate 27 impact from climate change. 28 29 National Academy of Medicine Action Collaborative on Decarbonizing the U.S. Health Sector . 30 The AMA is also a member of the National Academy of Medicine Action Collaborative on 31 Decarbonizing the Health Sector as a member of the Steering Committee and co-lead of the Health 32 Care Delivery Workgroup. The Climate Collaborative is a public -private partnership of leaders 33 from across the health system committed to addressing the sector's environmental impact while 34 strengthening its sustainability and resilience. The Climate Collaborative provides a neutral 35 platform for its participants to align around collective goals and actions for decarbonization, based 36 on evidence, shared solutions, and a commitment to improve health equity.xxv 37 38 In the first year of the Climate Collaborative, the Health Care Deliver y Workgroup has focused on 39 the following goals: 40 41 Goal 1: Make the multi -faceted case for health systems and hospitals to minimize their 42 carbon footprints and operate more sustainably ; 43 Goal 2: Identify a set of policy and regulatory barriers preventing progress on 44 decarbonization and resilience from accelerating, and identify solutions ; 45 Goal 3: Identify a core set of sustainability metrics for hospitals and clinical practice; 46 Goal 4: Develop decarbonization playbooks and best practices for hospitals and health care 47 delivery institutions, leveraging existing frameworks and success stories. 48 49 At the time of this report, the Health Care Deliver y Workgroup is in the final stages of building 50 consensus around goal s for 2023. 51 B of T Rep. 17 -A-23 -- page 9 of 19 1 Healthy Air Partners . The AMA has joined the American Lung Association's Healthy Air Partners 2 campaign , which is a coalition of 40 national public health, medical, nursing and health care 3 organizations engaged in healthy air advocacy efforts. xxviixxvi The Coalition is united in its calling for 4 strong federal laws and policies to slash air pollution and address climate change , recognizing 5 climate change can affect air quality, and certain air pollutants can affect climate change. So far in 6 2023, t he AMA has joined partners on a letter to the EPA urging them to quickly strengthen and 7 finalize the Standards of Performance for New, Reconstructed, and Modified Sources and 8 Emissions Guidelines for Existing Sources: Oil and Natural Gas Sector so that implementation can 9 begin and communities can begin to see the benefits of the pollution reductions. 10 11 The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which was signed into law on August 16, 2022, was the most 12 significant measure ever adopted by the U.S. Congress to combat climate change . The IRA is likely 13 to play an important role in mitigating the adverse health effects of climate change . Implementation 14 of the IRA will require extensive rulemaking; therefore, we anticipate that to be the focus of our 15 advocacy efforts in the coming year. 16 17 B. Prevent firearm injuries and deaths . 18 19 In the 1980's the AMA recognized firearms as a serious threat to the public's health as the weapons 20 are one of the main causes of intentional and unintentional injuries and deaths. At the 2016 Annual 21 Meeting, following the Pulse nightclub shooting, policy was adopted declaring that \"gun violence 22 represents a public health crisis which requires a comprehensive public health response and 23 solution.\" Since that time firearm injuries and deaths have increased and disparities have 24 widened.xxviii 25 26 1. Educate physicians on how to counsel at risk patients on firearm injury prevention and what 27 steps to take if a patient is at risk. 28 29 In 2018, the AMA created a CME module with physician experts on \"The Physician's Role in 30 Firearm Safety.\" The learning objectives of the module are as follows: (1) Describe the 31 epidemiology of firearm morbidity and mortality in the U.S.; (2) Recognize common risk factors 32 that elevate the potential for firearm injury; (3) Identify barriers to communicating with patients 33 about firearm safety; (4) Determine practical approaches to prepare for firearm safety counseling; 34 and (5) Effectively communicate how to reduce the risk of firearm injury and death.xxix The module 35 had 619 completions from 2019 - 2023 and has an overall quality rating of 4.4/5.0. The AMA is 36 currently in the process of updating the information in the module and will add a new case study 37 around dementia and firearms. The updated version is expected to launch in May of 2023. We 38 recognize that a broader dissemination strategy of the updated module will be necessary to improve 39 uptake among health care professionals. 40 41 Along with the updated CME, the AMA will launch an online tool to provide physicians with state - 42 specific laws in their jurisdiction related to counseling restrictions, safe storage and child access 43 protection laws, temporary transfer requirements, and extreme risk protection orders. This 44 information will help guide physicians when they identify patients at risk of firearm injury and 45 death by sharing details on what is allowed under state law. 46 47 2. Advocate for common sense policies to prevent firearm injuries and increase d funding for 48 research. 49 50 Congress succeeded in passing the first major firearm legislation in over 30 years with 51 B of T Rep. 17 -A-23 -- page 10 of 19 S. 2938, the \"Bipartisan Safer Communities Act\" (Murphy, D -CT/Cornyn, R -TX), which the AMA 1 supported. President Biden signed this bill into law on June 25, 2022, and AMA Board Chair 2 Sandra Adamson Fryhofer, MD, attended the signing ceremony. Key provisions of the bill 3 include: 4 5 Providing grants for states to establish or strengthen extreme risk protection orders; 6 Adding convicted domestic violence abusers in dating relationships to the National Instant 7 Criminal Background Check System (NICS); 8 Requiring the NICS to contact authorities to see whether an individual under the age of 21 9 has a \"disqualifying\" juvenile record for buying a firearm; 10 Making it a federal crime to buy a firearm on behalf of an individual who is prohibited 11 from doing so; and 12 Including new spending for school security and mental health treatment. 13 14 Our AMA is now focused on advocating to ensure that the new funding authorized in the new law 15 is actually appropriated, advocating for states to establish or strengthen extreme risk protection 16 orders, and ensuring that the other provisions are properly and quickly implemented. Pursuant to 17 the new law, the Department of Justice recently awarded over $200 million in grants to states, 18 territories, and the District of Columbia to fund state crisis intervention court proceedings, 19 including but not limited to, extreme risk protection order (ERPO) programs that work to keep 20 guns out of the hands of those who pose a threat to themselves or others. 21 22 The AMA has also advocate d for Congress to appropriate increased funding for research to prevent 23 firearm violence. The AMA is working with medical specialties, including the American Academy 24 of Pediatrics, to support $60 million in funding for the CDC and the National Institutes of Health 25 (NIH) to conduct public health research on firearm morbidity and mortality prevention. This would 26 double the amount of funding provided last year. Our AMA will continue to monitor appropriations 27 developments and advocate to ensure that this funding is approved by Congress. 28 29 Through the AMA's litigation center, we work to represent the interests of the medical profession 30 on this issue in the courts by providing support or becom ing actively involved in litigation of 31 importance to physicians. The AMA has created a website broadly outlining the organization's 32 advocacy efforts on gun violence prevention, this includes cases for which the AMA has filed 33 amicus briefs.xxx 34 35 3. Elevate the voices of physician leaders on the issue of firearm injury and violence prevention. 36 37 Through the AMA's video updates and podcast series, we amplify physician voices and highlight 38 developments and achievements throughout medicine. In June of 2022, the AMA featured Megan 39 Ranney MD, MPH, a practicing emergency physician, researcher and national advocate for 40 innovative approaches to public health at Brown University, talking about gun violence and why 41 we need to approach it as a public health issue with physicians playing an important role. xxxii xxxiiixxxi On 42 February 23, 2023, Emmy Betz, MD, MPH, professor of emergency medicine and director of the 43 Firearm Injury Prevention Initiative at the University of Colorado School of Medicine was featured 44 to discuss firearm -related injury and suicide and the role physicians can play in helping to prevent 45 it. AMA leaders, including Immediate Past President Gerald Harmon, MD, have also talked 46 about firearm injuries and deaths being a public health crisis that can affect everybody and that 47 requires a comprehensive public health response and a solution . 48 49 B of T Rep. 17 -A-23 -- page 11 of 19 4. Collaborate across the federation of medicine and with other interested partners to address the 1 public health crisis of firearm injuries and deaths with a unified voice. 2 3 American Foundation for Firearm Injury Reduction in Medicine. The AMA is a partner 4 organization of AFFIRM at The Aspen Institute, which is a non-profit dedicated to ending the 5 American firearm injury epidemic using a health -based approach. AFFIRM combines the health 6 expertise with the knowledge and traditions of responsible firearm stewardship to achieve 7 consensus recommendations. AFFIRM is committed to reducing the rate of firearm injuries and 8 deaths. AFFIRM at The Aspen Institute also builds partnerships with non-medical organizations 9 that are equally committed to preventing firearm injury, including groups committed to firearm 10 safety and shooting sports. 11 12 ACP -Led Call to Action on Firearm -Related Injury and Death . The AMA has joined the American 13 College of Physicians (ACP), American Academy of Family Physicians, American Academy of 14 Pediatrics, American College of Surgeons (ACS), American Psychiatric Association, and the 15 American Public Health Association in calling for policies to help stem firearms -related injuries 16 and deaths in the United States. The organizations endorsed the article, \"Firearm -Related Injury 17 and Death in the United States: A Call to Action From the Nation's Leading Physician and Public 18 Health Professional Organizations .\"xxxiv 19 20 Medical Summits and Coalition for Firearm Injury Prevention. The AMA also participated in a 21 2019 meeting on firearm violence organized by ACS and participat ed in a follow -up Medical 22 Summit on Firearm Injury Prevention sponsored by ACS in collaboration with the ACP, the 23 American College of Emergency Physicians, and the Council of Medical Specialty Societies in 24 September of 20022. The objectives of the 2022 summit were to use a consensus -based, non- 25 partisan approach to selecting recommendations for executive action and/or legislation at the 26 federal, state, and municipal levels that would decrease firearm -related injuries and identify 27 elements of the most effective programs that can be implemented by physician 28 practices/clinics/hospitals/health systems in partnership with their communities to effectively lower 29 the risk of violence, with an emphasis on marginalized communities that are disproportionately 30 impacted by violence. The Summit included representatives from 46 organizations, making it one 31 of the largest gatherings of medical and injury prevention professionals on this issue. The 32 proceedings of the Summit were published in the Journal of the American College of Surgeons . xxxvixxxv 33 To achieve the goals outlined at the Summit, the sponsoring organizations agreed to establish the 34 Healthcare Coalition for Firearm Injury Prevention. 35 36 AMA convened task force . On February 27, 2023, the AMA convened Phase I of the gun violence 37 task force, which consisted of those Federation members who have been most highly engaged on 38 the issue of firearm injury prevention for many years . Representatives from the American 39 Academy of Family Physicians, American Academy of Pediatrics, American College of 40 Emergency Physicians, American College of Physicians, American College of Surgeons , American 41 Psychiatric Association met with members of the AMA Board and staff . AMA Board Chair Sandra 42 Adamson Fryhofer, MD, Chair of the first phase of this Task Force, led the meeting . The goal was 43 to better understand work already underway to address this issue, what has worked well, and the 44 unique role an AMA convened task force could play. Gun violence advocacy organizations (Brady, 45 Giffords, and the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions) were also invited to share 46 their perspective s on the role of physicians and organized medicine in firearm injury prevention. 47 The advocacy groups strongly encouraged organized medicine to pick one or two things to focus 48 on and to speak on them with a unified voice. 49 50 C. Respond to emerging and remerging infectious disease threats and prepare for future pandemics. 51 B of T Rep. 17 -A-23 -- page 12 of 19 1 Infectious diseases continue to be a threat to the U.S. population. Although some diseases have 2 been conquered by modern advances such as antibiotics and vaccines, new ones are constantly 3 emerging, whereas others reemerge in drug- resistant forms (e.g., malaria, tuberculosis, and 4 bacterial pneumonias). Because no one knows what new diseases will emerge, the health system 5 must be prepared for the unexpected. Because the AMA is relied upon as a source of information 6 by physicians and patients, the AMA has to maintain a level of capacity to respond and share 7 information and advocate for physicians, patients, and the public in line with AMA policies . Over 8 the course of the past few years, this work has focused heavily on responding to the COVID- 19 9 pandemic and the outbreak of monkeypox (mpox). 10 11 1. Educate physicians on how to protect themselves and their patients from infectious disease 12 threats. 13 14 The AMA is a collaborator in Project Firstline, the CDC's National Training Collaborative for 15 Healthcare Infection Control . Project Firstline offers educational resources in a variety of formats 16 to meet the diverse learning needs and preferences of the health care workforce.xxxvii Resources are 17 designed to empower and enable health care professionals to think critically about infection 18 control, using adult learning principles, educational best practices, CDC recommendations, and the 19 science that informs them. Project Firstline encourages all health care professionals to take 20 advantage of these free infection control training resources - that were developed with healt h care 21 professionals , specifically for health care professional s. For COVID- 19 and mpox, the AMA also 22 developed resource centers to share information on testing, therapeutics, and vaccines along with 23 the latest clinical information. 24 25 2. Address preparedness for future infectious disease outbreaks and pandemics. 26 27 With over 1,000,000 individuals in the U.S. who have died as a result of COVID- 19, it is critical 28 that we evaluate shortcomings and successes and provide evidence -based guidelines to protect our 29 patients and the public from COVID- 19 and other future infectious pathogens. Given the 30 challenges that patients, physicians, hospitals, health care facilities, and our communities have 31 endured and continue to experience, we need to work to remedy the problems experienced during 32 the COVID- 19 pandemic regarding effective testing strategies, timely directives on appropriate 33 utilization of public health mitigation strategies, evidence -supported efforts to maintain strategic 34 stockpiles of personal protective equipment, ventilators, and other supplies, and to inform future 35 health system preparedness. 36 37 D. End the nation's drug overdose epidemic . 38 39 Ending the nation's drug overdose epidemic will require increased physician leadership, a greater 40 emphasis on overdose prevention and treatment, and better coordination and amplification of the 41 efforts and best practices already occurring across the country. 42 43 1. Educate physicians on overdose prevention, substance use treatment, and pain management. 44 45 The AMA makes education available to physicians on this topic via the AMA Ed HubTM to help 46 physicians gain critical knowledge around acute and chronic pain management, substance use 47 treatment, overdose prevention, and pain treatment . Courses are both developed by AMA as well as 48 by other partners. The AMA is also a member of the Providers Clinical Support System (PCSS) , 49 which is made up of a coalition of major health care organizations all dedicated to addressing this 50 health care crisis and is led by the American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry . PCSS provides 51 B of T Rep. 17 -A-23 -- page 13 of 19 evidence -based training and resources to give health care providers the skills and knowledge they 1 need to treat patients with opioid use disorders and chronic pain.xxxviii 2 3 2. Pr omote consistency in overdose -related outcome data and increase awareness for the need of 4 standardized state -level data. 5 6 The AMA has also developed an End the Epidemic Dashboard which compiles state -level data for 7 several indicators, including overdose mortality, non-fatal overdoses, opioid prescriptions, and 8 prescription drug monitoring program queries.xxxix The dashboard also highlights which states are 9 missing data for any of the indica tors. The goal of this dashboard is to continue to promote 10 consistency in overdose -related outcome data and increase awareness for the need of standardized 11 state-level data. 12 13 3. Convene the AMA Substance Use and Pain Care Task Force to advanc e evidence- based 14 recommendations for policymakers and physicians , including harm reduction strategies . 15 16 In 2015, the American Medical Association convened more than 25 national, state, specialty and 17 other health care associations to develop industry- wide recommendations for physicians to help 18 end the nation's opioid epidemic. In 2019, the AMA Pain Care Task Force highlighted efforts 19 needed to help patients with pain. In 2021, the AMA joined the two task forces to address the 20 changing\u2014 and worsening \u2014drug overdose epidemic, emphasizing tangible actions needed to 21 increase access to evidence -based care for patients. The task force , under the leadership of Bobby 22 Mukkamala, MD, Immediate Past Chair of the AMA Board of Trustees, continues to advan ce 23 evidence -based recommendations for policymakers and physicians to help end the nation's drug- 24 related overdose epidemic. The task force recommendations are largely focused in the health care 25 sector, addressing access to treatment.xl Recommendation 4 is focused on public health and harm 26 reduction. 27 28 Recommendation 1: Support patients with pain, mental illness or a substance use disorder 29 (SUD) by building an evidence -based, sustainable and resilient infrastructure and health 30 care workforce. 31 Recommendation 2: Remove barriers to evidence -based treatment for SUDs, cooccurring 32 mental illness and pain. 33 Recommendation 3: Support coverage for, access to, and payment of comprehensive, 34 multi- disciplinary, multi- modal evidence -based treatment for patients with pain, a 35 substance use disorder or mental illness. 36 Recommendation 4: Broaden public health and harm reduction strategies to save lives from 37 overdose, limit the spread of infectious disease, eliminate stigma and reduce harms for 38 people who use drugs and other substances. 39 Recommendation 5: Improve stakeholder and multi -sector collaboration in an effort to 40 ensure that the patients, policymakers, employers, and communities benefit from evidence - 41 based decisions . 42 43 The AMA develops on annual report on the overdose epidemic outlining accomplishments and 44 what still needs to be done.xli 45 46 4. Collaborate with external stakeholders to address the opioid addiction crisis. 47 48 The AMA is a member of the National Academy of Medicine (NAM) Action Collaborative on 49 Countering the U.S. Opioid Epidemic . The Action Collaborative was formed in 2018 as a public - 50 B of T Rep. 17 -A-23 -- page 14 of 19 private partnership to foster greater coordination and collective action across the health system and 1 beyond in addressing the opioid addiction crisis.xlii The Action Collaborative uses a systems 2 approach to convene and catalyze public, private, and non-profit stakeholders to develop, curate, 3 and disseminate multi- sector solutions designed to reduce opioid misuse, and improve outcomes 4 for individuals, families, and communities affected by the opioid crisis . 5 6 The Action Collaborative conducts its work around four core priority areas: Health Professional 7 Education and Training; Pain Management Guidelines and E vidence Standards; Prevention, 8 Treatment, and Recovery Services; and Research, Data, and Metrics Needs. The Action 9 Collaborative produces discussion papers to advance the field and accelerate action where the 10 evidence dictates; conducts outreach; and leads convenings, webinars, and other special events to 11 accelerate the translation of the most promising opportunities to reverse the opioid crisis. 12 13 3. Strengthen the health system through improved collaboration between medicine and 14 public health. 15 16 A. Strengthen physician and trainee knowledge of public health and social determinants of health. 17 18 The AMA makes education on public health and health equity available on the AMA Ed HubTM to 19 empower individuals and organizations, in health care and beyond, in advancing health equity and 20 the betterment of public health . The Ed Hub contains curated education from trusted sources on a 21 wide range of public health issues. The AMA's Center for Health Equity has developed educational 22 content to empower individuals and organizations, in health care and beyond, in advancing racial 23 justice and equity.xliii 24 25 The AMA is transforming medical education across the continuum and collaborating with 26 undergraduate and graduate medical education institutions to create a system that trains physicians 27 to meet the needs of today's patients and anticipate future changes. This includes working with 28 schools to implement instruction in health systems science (HSS), the third pillar of medical 29 education, along with the basic and clinical sciences. The HSS curriculum includes issues related to 30 how social determinants of health affect the entire population and the improvement strategies at the 31 population health level to address gaps in care such as the organized assessment, monitoring or 32 measurement of key health metrics necessary to improve health outcomes for a group of 33 individuals.xliv 34 35 B. Maintain AMA relationships with national public health organizations . 36 37 The Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO), National Association of City 38 and County Health Officials (NACCHO), and the American Public Health Association (APHA) are 39 all designated liaisons to the Council on Science and Public Health. AMA staff are engaged in 40 regular discussions to understand their perspectives and opportunities for collaboration. 41 42 C. Collaborate with leading health care organizations to strengthen the interface between public 43 health and health care. 44 45 A new health care industry consortium has agreed to work together, in partnership with public 46 health, to focus on strengthening the interface between public health and health care. The 47 consortium includes some of the most prominent and influential organizations from the health care 48 sector. Core membership organizations will include: AHIP (formerly America's Health Insurance 49 Plans) , Alliance of Community Health Plans (ACHP) , American Hospital Association (AHA) , 50 American Medical Association (AMA) , and Kaiser Permanente (KP) . 51 B of T Rep. 17 -A-23 -- page 15 of 19 1 The consortium, which will be governed by senior leaders from each of the core member 2 organizations and staffed by independent policy analysts and other experts, will focus on areas 3 where there is significant opportunity for consensus building and where health care partners are 4 uniquely positioned to play a significant role in advancing the work. The consortium has agreed to 5 focus its initial work on four specific priorities and will work over the coming months to further 6 define concrete, pragmatic, and tangible actions to advance these priorities. 7 8 Priority Actions Areas will include. 9 1) Formaliz ing agreements and support ing coordinated efforts between public health and 10 health care with clear communication of goals, roles, responsibilities, tasks, and 11 deliverables. 12 2) Evolv ing and support ing robust scalable emergency preparedness programs. 13 3) Establish ing national standards, processes and use cases for stratifying public health and 14 health care data by sociodemographic variables to identify disproportionate health impacts 15 and outcomes at the community level. 16 4) Moderniz ing and integrat ing an infectious disease surveillance system that unifies data 17 across sectors, agencies, and data systems, including novel data sources (e.g., social media) 18 and advanced analysis methods. 19 20 4. Combat the spread of misinformation and disinformation . 21 22 At the 2022 Annual Meeting of the HOD, the Board's report on, \"Addressing Public Health 23 Disinformation Disseminated by Health Professionals\" was adopted. AMA P olicy , D-440.914, 24 \"Addressing Public Health Disinformation Disseminated by Health Professionals ,\" 25 outlines a comprehensive strategy to address health -related disinformation disseminated by health 26 professionals. Aspects most relevant to public health include the following: 27 28 A. Maintaining AMA as a trusted source of evidence- based information for physicians and 29 patients. 30 31 While the public's trust in many institutions has waned during the COVID- 19 pandemic, people 32 generally still trust their doctors. In his November 12, 2021, address to the AMA House of 33 Delegates, AMA CEO/EVP James Madara, MD, noted that, \"[t]he AMA exists to benefit the 34 public, but we do so in a very particular way \u2014by being the physicians' powerful ally in patient 35 care. We serve the public by serving those who care for the public. Supporting physicians and 36 improving our nation's health has been our focus since 1847.\"xlv 37 38 B. Combat public health mis- and disinformation that undermines public health initiatives . 39 40 The AMA has continued to issue press statements, noting the harm of mis- and disinformation and 41 has urged the CEOs of six leading social media and e-commerce companies to assist the effort by 42 combatting misinformation and disinformation on their platforms . The AMA has remained a source 43 of trusted information providing physicians with up-to-date information on public health issues. 44 45 C. Collaborate with stakeholders to ensu re all patients have equitable access to and confidence in 46 accurate, understandable, and relevant information necessary to make health decisions . 47 48 The AMA has engaged in several collaborates to address mis- and disinformation. The recently 49 announced Coalition for Trust in Health and Science brings together reputable associations 50 representing academics, researchers, scientists, doctors, nurses, pharmacists, drug and insurance 51 B of T Rep. 17 -A-23 -- page 16 of 19 companies, consumer advocates, and public health professionals. xlviixlvi The coalition will suppor t 1 efforts to advance people's scientific and health literacy, earn public trust and improve health 2 outcomes and health equity as well as to correct misinformation and counter disinformation that 3 threatens health and well -being. The AMA has also been engaged with the work led by NAM, 4 WHO, and the Council of Medical Specialty Societies on a project focused on identifying credible 5 sources of health information in social media. 6 7 CONCLUSION 8 9 The strategy outlined provides an overview of the work the AMA is doing in public health and 10 indicates our current priorities. While much of this work resides in Health, Science and Ethics, 11 other business units lead portions of this work including Improving Health Outcomes, the Center 12 for Health Equity and Medical Education. Advocacy, Communications, the Ed Hub team , 13 Marketing and Member Experience are also vital to advancing these efforts . Many of the public 14 health crises being addressed by the AMA are not going to be solved by our organization alone. 15 Collaboration is going to be critical, and the AMA has taken steps to engage other organizations in 16 this work where it makes sense. While there are many areas where the AMA is asked to engage, 17 the areas outlined above represent our focus in advancing the AMA's mission towards the 18 betterment of public health. 19 20 RECOMMENDATION 21 22 The Board of Trustees recommends that the following be adopted in lieu of Resolution 605- A-22 23 and the remainder of the report be filed . 24 25 1. Our AMA will distribute evidence -based information on the relationship between climate 26 change and human health through existing platforms and communications channels , 27 identify advocacy and leadership opportunities to elevate the voices of physicians on the 28 public health crisis of climate change , and centralize our AMA's efforts towards 29 environmental justice and an equitable transition to a net-zero carbon society by 2050. 30 (New HOD Policy) 31 B of T Rep. 17 -A-23 -- page 17 of 19 REFERENCES i World Health Organization.

REPORT 04 OF THE COUNCIL ON SCIENCE AND PUBLIC HEALTH (A- 23) School Resource Officer Violence De- escalation Training and Certification (Reference Committee D) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY INTRODUCTION. Resolution 416- A-22, referred for study by the House of Delegates, asked that our American Medical Association study the efficacy of School Resource Officer violence de - escalation training and certification. METHODS. English language articl es were selected from searches of PubMed and Google Scholar using the search terms \"school resource officer\", \"school -based law enforcement,\" and \"school resource officers AND training\". Additional articles were identified by manual review of the reference lists of pertinent publications. Web sites managed by government agencies; applicable organizations were also reviewed for relevant information. BACKGROUND. A school resource officer (SRO) is a carefully selected, specifically trained, and properly equipped full -time law enforcement officer, trained in school -based law enforcement and crisis response, assigned to work in the school using community- oriented policing concepts. Recently, the number of SROs has skyrocketed. Opponents to SROs argue that they damage school climate, criminalize relatively trivial student behavior, and fuel the school -to-prison pipeline. While proponents argue that SROs promote school safety, respond quickly to emergencies, and serve as mentors, role models, and law -related educators for students. SRO officers may receive training in, among other things, mental health awareness, adolescent development and communication, implicit bias, trauma -informed care, conflict de -escalation, crisis intervention, cultural competence, and school -specific topics. However, within school systems, trainings vary in content and delivery. One intervention, which has limited support in the research literature, is the use of de- escalation techniques and training for educational entities to mitigate the impact of peer agg ression and promote the safety of the school environment. CONCLUSION. This report recognizes that SROs are part of the school staff at large and should not be considered a separate entity from school counselors, social workers, school psychologists, nurses, and schoolteachers. The recommendations support the need for their roles to be defined within the team structure of the school and also supports the use of community- based policing practices to ensure that the community plays a role in prioritizing an d addressing public safety. The current evidence is inconclusive on the effectiveness of de -escalation training for SROs. However, research shows that multi- faceted interventions are more likely to be effective, especially in school settings. Further, the recommendations support establishing an agreed -upon operating protocol or memorandum of understanding (MOU) that include s provisions addressing daily interactions between students and school personnel with SROs . \u00a9 2023 American Medical Association.

REPORT OF THE COUNCIL ON SCIENCE AND PUBLIC HEALTH CSAPH Report 04- A-23 Subject: School Resource Officer Violence De-escalation Training and Certification Presented by: Noel Deep, MD, Chair Referred to: Reference Committee D Resolution 416- A-22, referred for study by the House of Delegates, asked that our American 1 Medical Asso ciation study the efficacy of School Resource Officer violence de- escalation training 2 and certification. 3 4 BACKGROUND 5 6 A school resource officer (SRO) is a carefully selected, specifically trained, and properly equipped 7 full-time law enforcement officer, trained in school -based law enforcement and crisis response, 8 assigned to work in the school using community- oriented policing concepts. 1 Recently, the number 9 of SROs has skyrocketed. An estimated 14,000 to 20,000 SROs now work in schools, and the 10 number continues to grow.2 Opponents argue that SROs damage school climate, criminalize 11 relatively trivial student behavior, and fuel the school -to-prison pipeline.3 Proponents argue that 12 SROs promote school safety, respond quickly to emerge ncies, and serve as mentors, role models, 13 and law -related educators for students. One report concluded that for every dollar invested in the 14 program, a minimum of $11.13 of social and economic value was created.4 15 16 SRO officers may receive training in, am ong other things, mental health awareness, adolescent 17 development and communication, implicit bias, trauma -informed care, conflict de -escalation, crisis 18 intervention, cultural competence, and school -specific topics.5 However, within school systems , 19 trainings vary in content and delivery. For example, some training courses include information on 20 evaluation of the de -escalation and crisis response (e.g., support for staff and students after an 21 incident). Further, some training may be a stand- alone curriculum, whereas others may include de - 22 escalation as a topic within other training topics (e.g., classroom management, discipline policy, 23 academic planning). 24 25 One main intervention, which has limited support in the research literature, is the use of de- 26 escalation techniques and trainings for educational entities to mitigate the impact of peer 27 aggression and promote the safety of the school environment.6 Across various professional fields, 28 such as public health and education, de -escalation training invo lves learning strategies for the 29 prevention and the management of aggression and violence. De -escalation may include training in 30 early intervention practices, communication methods (i.e., verbal and non- verbal styles), 31 appropriate responses in potentially violent situations, and the correct use of physical intervention 32 techniques (e.g., restraint techniques, protection). The training is intended to reduce conflict, 33 aggression, and harm. In an educational setting, de -escalation can be defined as a range of 34 interconnected interventions that include verbal and non- verbal communication, self -regulation 35 assessment, and actions taken while maintaining the safety of the those in the school. 36 CSAPH Rep. 04- A-23 -- page 2 of 14 METHODS 1 2 English language articles were selected from searches of PubMed and Google Scholar using the 3 search terms \"school resource officer\", \"school -based law enforcement,\" and \"school resource 4 officers AND training\". Additional articles were identified by manual review of the reference lists 5 of pertinent publications. Websi tes managed by government agencies; applicable organizations 6 were also reviewed for relevant information. 7 8 DISCUSSION 9 10 What are SROs? 11 12 The only definition of SRO in current federal law appears under the authorizing legislation for the 13 Office of Community O riented Policing Services (COPS Office), which is a component of the U.S. 14 Department of Justice responsible for advancing the practice of community policing primarily 15 through grant resources. This statute defines an SRO as \"a career law enforcement officer , with 16 sworn authority, deployed in community- oriented policing, and assigned by the employing police 17 department or agency to work in collaboration with schools and community- based organizations.\"7 18 Although specific responsibilities and functions of SROs vary from place to place, the \"triad\" 19 concept of school -based policing divides SRO responsibilities into three main areas of: teacher, 20 informal counselor, and law enforcement officer .8 21 22 History of SROs 23 24 Since the 1900s, U.S. public schools have employed a growing number of SROs. In 1975, only 1 25 percent of schools reported having police officers on site, but by 2018, approximately 58 percent of 26 schools had at least one sworn law enforcement official presen t during the school week.9 In 27 response to school shootings in the 1990s, federal and state legislation spurred this rapid 28 proliferation of SROs. 29 30 The first use of SROs in schools is reported to have been in Flint, Michigan, in the early 1950s.10 31 While po lice have had a presence in schools since then, it has only been over the past 20 years that 32 the practice of assigning police officers to schools on a full -time basis has become more 33 widespread. The number of SROs expanded significantly beginning in the 19 90s due to legislative 34 initiatives in response to concerns over a series of school shootings including the Columbine 35 tragedy. The 1994 reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA ) 36 included provisions that established school safety as a core focus for the U.S. Department of 37 Education (U.S. DOE).11 It also included the Safe and Drug -Free Schools and Communities Act, 38 which authorized federal support for police in schools via a grant program wherein local education 39 agencies could use funds to hire and train SROs.7,12 Between 1994 and 2009, up to 40 percent of 40 federal funding for this act could be used to hire and train school police and support other security 41 measures.13 Overall, since 1998, the federal government has invested over $1 billion to explicitly 42 increase police presence in schools, and over $14 billion to advance community policing, which 43 can include SROs.10,14 44 45 In recent years, federal funding and support for SROs ha s increased following tragic school 46 shootings. D espite their concerns about the unintended negative consequences of SROs, the Obama 47 Administration renewed funding to increase the number of SROs across the country after the 2012 48 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.15 Following the 2018 49 CSAPH Rep. 04- A-23 -- page 3 of 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, the Trump 1 Administration prioritized SRO positions in selecting COPS grants recipients.16 2 Federal Policy on SROs 3 4 Despite their growth and the substantial federal funding, there is very little federal policy explicitly 5 defining the role of SROs. The absence of SROs from federal educational policy is in part due to 6 the Obama administration's concerns over unintended ne gative consequences of police presence in 7 schools.17 The vagueness of federal law has led to large variation in the role, expectations, and 8 accountability of police in schools. Moreover, federal -level data collection on SROs is also 9 severely lacking. SROs are not required to register with any national database, police departments 10 are not required to report how many of their officers work as SROs, and school systems are not 11 required to report how many SROs they employ.1 Since 2013- 2014, the U.S. Department of 12 Education has collected survey data every other year that details the number of student referrals 13 and arrests made by school police (including SROs) in public schools, and which students are most 14 affected.18 The data also include the number of counselors , social workers, school psychologists, 15 and nurses that are in a school compared to the number of SROs.19 Given this overall lack of 16 descriptive data there is little information on the roles of SROs nationally or how, if at all, SROs 17 are trained. By failin g to collect these data, it is difficult to monitor and evaluate the work of SROs 18 and their impact. 19 20 State Policy on SROs 21 22 Federal policy and accompanied funding initiatives fueled the growth of SROs programs which are 23 now operated in all 50 states.14,19 Yet, the lack of federal law on SROs has led to a patchwork of 24 state policy. Out of all 50 states and Washington D.C., only 26 jurisdictions specifically define 25 SRO in state statutes or regulations.19 These state- level definitions do not specify the role of SROs 26 in schools. Most states encourage schools or districts to enter into a Memorandum of 27 Understanding (MOU) with local law enforcement if they provide an SRO. For example, 28 Connecticut, Massachusetts, Ohio, and South Carolina require MOUs to outline th e role of the 29 SRO.20 30 31 The National Association of School Resource Officers ( NASRO) suggests SROs receive at least 40 32 hours of specialized training in school policing prior to being assigned.20 NASRO's Basic SRO 33 training is set up as a 5 - day, 40- hour block of instruction and outline s evidence -based best 34 practices for SRO programs .20 This training covers the following topics: constitutional and state 35 law, armed response, crime prevention and mit igation, interview and interrogation techniques, 36 investigations, crime prevention through environmental school design, patrol operations, advocacy 37 within the juvenile justice system, and mandatory reporting.20 Twenty -eight state statutes or 38 regulations inc lude language regarding training requirements for SROs, but these also vary widely 39 and laws in only two states specify a required length of training.21 In several states, the training is 40 simply what is required of traditional law enforcement, including fir earm or active shooter 41 training.22 Instruction regarding how to effectively interact with youth averages around four to six 42 hours across all states.22 Training in sixteen states includes what is required of traditional law 43 enforcement in addition to school -specific training. Few states explicitly require training in de - 44 escalation or conflict resolution, mental health, youth development, or school climate.22 Only 45 Maryland and Utah explicitly include provisions for training in \"implicit bias and disability and 46 diversity awareness with specific attention to racial and ethnic disparities\" and \"cultural 47 awareness,\" respectively.22 Therefore , across states there i s wide variation in expectations 48 regarding SRO training. Additionally, training is primarily standard police training, with little 49 education on working in school settings and with youth. 50 51 CSAPH Rep. 04- A-23 -- page 4 of 14 Illinois is an example of this heterogeneity of approach. Illinois s tate law requires SROs to 1 complete training within one year of assignment.23 This training must cover juvenile developmental 2 issues, youth mental health, how to prevent child abuse and exploitation, and various educational 3 administrative issues. Illinois d oes not explicitly require implicit bias, disability training, or de - 4 escalation training. 5 6 School District Policy on SROs 7 8 SRO training and duties vary across school districts. In general, SROs must enforce school rules 9 and the law, as well as be visible authority figures in schools. They can also participate in 10 mentorship programs, provide students with training on safety and violence, and promote a positive 11 school environment.24 SROs usually patrol school halls to discourage students from misbehaving, 12 and when a student is caught breaking a school rule or the law, SROs step in to investigate and 13 assist with student discipline. Certain school districts require SROs to follow zero tolerance polices 14 when students are caught with drugs, meaning the SRO has zer o discretion in how to respond. 15 Other schoo l districts allow SROs to use discretion to decide a disciplinary course of action.22 16 17 Benefits of School Resource Officers 18 19 School resource officers can provide a variety of benefits not only to schools, but to individual 20 students and local police departments. These benefits include promoting school safety, addressing 21 the root causes of student misbehavior, and decreasing juvenile delinquency petitions where SROs 22 are properly utilized.25 Further, SROs can improve relationships between students and law 23 enforcement, serve as protectors for victimized students, and reduce the burden on local law 24 enforcement. Although there has been limited r esearch, it is hypothesized that SROs can promote 25 safety in schools by deterr ing criminal activity at schools, specifically more serious crimes 26 including possession of a weapon and assault.26 SROs can also aid in reducing the amount of 27 fighting and bullying on campus through hallway patrols, which can allow SROs to intervene 28 rather quickly when there is a fight.26 Students may be less likely to break the rules or pick a fight 29 when SROs are patrolling school grounds because of the increased probability of being caught. 30 31 Some districts have found that SROs can use their positions to i dentify the root cause of school 32 misbehavior and help students address it. When SROs are properly utilized, they can potentially 33 help offset the school -to-prison pipeline. For example, SROs in Franklin County, Virginia, often 34 impose alternative methods of punishment to delinquency petitions, such as community service, 35 school service, or mediation.26 Once a student has completed his act of service, they are often 36 encouraged to participate in afterschool extracurricular activities in order to create structure and 37 prevent a second offense. In Franklin County, SROs only send a request for a delinquency petition 38 to the state's attorney after all other avenues have been explored. A study of schools in this county 39 that utilize this approach found a 64 percent decrease in potential delinquency petitions.27 40 41 Research also reveals that SRO programs can improve relationships and build trust between 42 students and law enforcement. A 2016 study that surveyed students from various schools in one 43 southeastern U.S. sc hool district analyzed how students' attitudes towards SROs change with 44 increased interaction.26 Overall, more student -SRO interactions were positively correlated with 45 favorable feelings towards SROs. Other research shows that this improved trust can later help 46 uncover previously unknown issues of abuse and neglect, because victims may feel more 47 comfortable reporting the issue to law enforcement.27 Additionally, SROs can sometimes serve as 48 protectors for students, which can make students feel more comfortab le asking for help. This is 49 especially true for students who are victims of various crimes, abuse, and bullying, and who may 50 feel safer attending school knowing an SRO is available to protect them.27 SROs have the unique 51 CSAPH Rep. 04- A-23 -- page 5 of 14 ability to immediately intervene if a juvenile offender violates any court ordered condition, thereby 1 increasing a victim's sense of safety at school. Finally, SROs can reduce the burden on law 2 enforcement outside of the school. When officers are stationed at schools, the school often no 3 longer needs to call 911 when a dangerous situation arises because it simply informs the SRO. This 4 gives the school a quick response time while allowing patrol officers to focus on issues outside of 5 schools. Overall , some of the benefits of SROs include: 6 7 Increasing feelings of safety among students, teachers, and administrators, 8 Deterring aggressive behavior, and empowering staff to maintain order and address 9 behavioral issues in a timely fashion, 10 Diminishing classroom time spent on discipline and behavioral disruptions, 11 Improving school safety and reducing school -based crime , 12 Increasing the likelihood that students report witnessing a crime, and help reduce 13 community -wide criminality, and 14 Improving relationships between law enforcement and youth. 15 16 Impact s on Safety for Marginalized Youth 17 18 In the triad model concept advanced by NASRO, in addition to their law enforcement role, SROs 19 will act as another mentor, educator, or counselor. However, this assumption ignores the fact that 20 Black youth, Latinx youth, immigrant youth, indigenous youth, and youth living in poverty often 21 come to school with harmful experiences with police that may perpetuate racial inequalities in 22 educational, health, and social outcomes.28 By p lacing SROs in schools, these traumatic issues can 23 be exacerbat ed. SROs are more likely to reproduce broader patterns of police targeting and 24 criminalizing Black, Indigenous, Latinx, and students of color.29 25 26 Further, SROs are disproportionately placed in schools serving predominantly students of color, 27 as opposed to schools serving predominantly white populations.30 Among middle and high 28 schools where more than 75 percent of students were Black, 54.1 percent had at least one SRO or 29 security officer on campus.31,32 By comparison, among middle and high schools where over 75 30 percent of students were white, only 32 percent had SROs .32,33 31 32 SROs Are Associated with Higher Rates of Exclusionary Discipline and Criminalization 33 34 Additionally, numerous studies show that the presence of SROs in schools is associated with higher 35 rates of exclusionary discipline ( suspensions and expulsions ) which increases the risk of students 36 being pushed into the \"school to prison pipeline .\" 33 Students of color across the nation are 37 disproportionately subject to these exclusionary discipline practices.34 For example, i n Connecticut, 38 suspension and expulsion rates for Black and Latino male students are two to three times that of 39 their white counterparts.35 The suspension rate for Black female s tudents is around five times that 40 of their white counterparts.36 41 42 Additionally, SROs create the potential to escalate school disciplinary issues, even minor ones , into 43 arrestable offenses.36 In one survey of SROs, 77 percent reported that they had arrested a student to 44 calm them down and 55 percent reported arresting students for minor offenses because the teacher 45 wanted the student to be arrested.37 The majority of school -based arrests are for non -violent 46 offenses, such as disruptive behavior.39 Further , studies show that the presence of an SRO increases 47 the number of arrests for \"disorderly conduct\" - an often ambiguous, and subjective 48 characterizat ion of behavior.38 Overall, research suggests that SROs' potential to escalate conflicts 49 puts students at risk.39 For example, schools that employed police had an arrest rate 3.5 times that 50 CSAPH Rep. 04- A-23 -- page 6 of 14 of schools without police.40 As with exclusionary discipline, students of color are 1 disproportionately subject to school arrests.42 2 This pipeline extends further for undocumente d students, as contact with SROs can put them at risk 3 of detention and deportation.41 This risk is heightened in communities where local law enforcement 4 is contracted with Immigration and Customs Enforcement under 287(g) agreements - which allows 5 the Depar tment of Homeland Security to deputize selected state and local law enforcement officers 6 to enforce federal immigration law.42 Since 2013, COPS Grants have required recipients to sign a 7 287(g) agreement in order to receive funds. There are several document ed cases of SROs putting 8 immigrant students at risk of \"school -to-deportation pipeline s.43,44 9 10 Interference with Education 11 12 The presence of SROs and exclusionary discipline negatively impacts students' academic 13 achievement and can accelerate future misbehavior, truancy, and drop- out rates .47 Students who 14 have contact with the criminal legal system through arrests and searches experience worse 15 schooling outcomes than those who do not. Arresting students doubles their risk of dropping out.45 16 The conseq uences of a school arrest extend far beyond a youths' public -school outcomes and 17 include the loss of access to higher education and funding, job eligibility, access to public housing, 18 and increasing both the likelihood and consequence of future law enforce ment contact.46 Further, 19 trauma and anxiety symptoms can increase with the frequency of police contact, regardless of 20 where that contact occurs. For many students of color, police presence in schools can cause re- 21 traumatization given their negative experi ences with law enforcement in their communities.50 22 23 The presence of SROs can shift the focus from learning and supporting students to over - 24 disciplining and criminalizing them. Regular police contact, even if this contact is in passing, 25 affects how Black and Latinx youth perceive themselves, their school, and law enforcement.47 26 Students of color have reported feeling the police are there to protect the school from them.41 27 Further , other research shows that the presence of SROs reduced students' feelings of school 28 connectedness - the belief that adults and peers in the school care about them as humans.26,48 29 School connectedness is an important protective factor - young people who feel connected to their 30 school are less likely to engage in behavior s that are harmful to themselves or others and are more 31 likely to have better academic achievement, attendance, and persistence.50 Research also 32 demonstrates that racial and ethnic disparities in discipline are not the consequence of differences 33 in rates or types of misbehavior by students of color and white students but rather racial and 34 cultural biases.44 35 36 Lastly, the focus on SROs has also diverted attention and funds from other areas of education that 37 could support students. Between 1999 and 2015, the percentage of students who reported security 38 guards or assigned police officers in their schools increased from 54 percent to 70 percent while the 39 number of school counselors increased by only 5 percent , after adjusting for the growth in student 40 enrollmen t.42 There are also more sworn law enforcement officers than social workers in schools 41 across the U.S. , with many states employing two-to-three times as many police officers in than 42 social workers in schools.49 Over 4,800 schools reported employing more sc hool police and 43 security than school -based mental health providers.53 Across the country 1.7 million students are in 44 schools with police but no counselors; 3 million are in schools with police but no nurses; 6 million 45 students are in schools with police but no school psychologists; 10 million students are in schools 46 with police but no social workers.42 Compared to white students, Latinx, Asian, and Black students 47 are more likely to attend schools where the districts chose SROs over counselors.50 48 49 Impact of SROs on School Shootings 50 CSAPH Rep. 04- A-23 -- page 7 of 14 1 There is limited evidence supporting th e role of SROs in prevent ing school shootings.51 Research 2 on averted school shootings - incidents planned by students and then prevented - suggests that the 3 key is having trusted adults whom other students can inform.52 One study found that students are 4 much more likely to report a planned shooting to s chool staff members; they rarely report this to a 5 member of law enforcement.56 There is also limited evidence on whether SROs can stop an active 6 shooter or lower deaths or injuries when a school shooting happens. A recent study found that 7 among all schools that experienced a school shooting between 1999 and 2018, the number of 8 injuries and deaths was about 2.5 times higher in schools that had an SRO.53 However, in at least 9 one instance a school shooter deliberately selected an elementary school with no secu rity personnel 10 instead of the middle school they attended because their middle school had an armed security 11 officer.54 Further, one study found in one -quarter of the studied cases with an active shooter, the 12 officer or SRO was able to make it to the scene of the attack within one minute. In three of the 13 attacks (7 percent ), it took between one and five minutes for the officer to respond, and for two 14 attacks (5 percent ), it took between five and ten minutes.55 In sum, further research is needed to 15 unde rstand the role SRO's have in deterring school shooters. 16 17 Maximizing the Benefits of SRO Programs 18 19 Although there has been interest in encouraging the expansion of SRO programs to promote school 20 safety, some are concerned about the negative effect s SROs c ould have on the school environment. 21 While research on the efficacy of particular program models or characteristics is limited, the COPS 22 Office, has identified several elements of a successful SRO program.56 First, the COPS guide 23 suggests that all schools should develop a comprehensive school safety plan based on their school 24 safety goals and a thorough analysis of the problem(s) the school is facing before determining if it 25 is necessary to employ an SRO.59 In some instances, school safety plans might not r equire the 26 deployment of an SRO. However, if after composing a school safety plan the school decides to use 27 an SRO, there should be clear goals for the program. SROs should engage in problem -solving 28 policing activities that directly relate to school safety goals and address identified needs, and data 29 should be collected to determine whether the program is achieving its goals. 30 31 Second, the COPS guide suggests that schools and the law enforcement agencies that SROs work 32 for should be aware of any pitfalls be fore agreeing to establish an SRO program.59 There may be 33 philosophical differences between school administrators and law enforcement agencies about the 34 role of the SRO. Law enforcement agencies focus on public safety while schools focus on 35 educating stude nts. Establishing an agreed- upon operating protocol or MOU is considered a critical 36 element of an effective school -police partnership. The MOU should clearly state the roles and 37 responsibilities of SROs involved in the program.59 However, most schools employing SROs do not 38 enter into a MOU. Further, MOUs are not publicly available on school websites. This means that 39 key stakeholders such as students and families lack easy access to information regarding their 40 rights in relation to interacting with police in schools.69 41 42 Third, the COPS guide suggests that selecting officers who are likely to succeed in a school 43 environment \u2014such as officers who can effectively work with students, parents, and school 44 administrators; have an understandi ng of child development and psychology; and have public 45 speaking and teaching skills \u2014and properly training those officers are important components of a 46 successful SRO program.59 While it is possible to recruit officers with some of the skills necessary 47 to be effective SROs, it is also important to provide training so officers can hone skills they already 48 have or develop new skills that can make them more effective. The Police Foundation, for instance, 49 recommends that training for SROs focus on the following : 50 CSAPH Rep. 04- A-23 -- page 8 of 14 child and adolescent development, with an emphasis on the effect of trauma on student 1 behavior, health, and learning, 2 subconscious (or implicit) bias that can disproportionately affect youth of color and youth 3 with disabilities or mental health issues, 4 crisis intervention for youth , 5 alternatives to detention and incarceration, such as peer courts, restorative justice, etc. , and 6 legal issues like special protections for students with disabilities.57 7 8 Further, on e study that survey ed educators, students, officers, and community members suggest s 9 that successful SRO programs can do the following: 10 Increase feelings of safety among students, teachers, and administrators, 11 Deter aggressive behavior, and empower staff to maintain order and address behavioral 12 issues in a timely fashion, 13 Diminish classroom time spent on discipline and behavioral disruptions, 14 Improve school safety and reduce school -based crime, 15 Increase the likelihood that students report witnessing a crime, and help reduce 16 community -wide criminality, and 17 Improve relationships between law enforcement and youth.58 18 19 EXISTING AMA POLICY 20 21 AMA policy H -60.902, \" School Resource Officer Qualifications and Training\" encourages an 22 evaluation of existing national standards to have qualifications through training and certification 23 that includes child psychology and development, restorative justice, conflict resolution, crime 24 awareness, implicit/explicit biases, diversity inclusion, cultural humility, and individual and 25 institutional safety and others deemed necessary for school resource officers . It also encourages the 26 development of policies that foster the best environment for learning through protecting the health 27 and safety of t hose in school, including students, teachers, staff, and visitors. 28 29 CONCLUSIONS 30 31 Police stationed within K -12 schools, known as SROs , are a common feature of American schools. 32 According to federal data, about half of schools had an SRO on school grounds at least once a 33 week during the 2017- 2018 school year.59 In the same year, a national survey found that 80 percent 34 of parents supported having police officers in schools, and some states, like Maryland, passed new 35 laws mandating adequate law enforcement at a ll schools as a result of school shootings .60,61 36 However, since George Floyd's death in 2020, the U.S. has experienced an intensified debate about 37 the proper role of police in communities, including schools. As a result, school districts, including 38 Chicago and Los Angeles, have significantly cut their budgets for school policing .62 39 40 Opponents of SROs often cite specific incidents of police violence against Black students in 41 schools and link SROs to the broader concept of a school -to-prison pipeline, in whic h students' 42 early experiences with school discipline and/or police in schools may directly or indirectly 43 influence their lifetime involvement with the criminal justice system.62 Critics of SROs fear that 44 having a police officer within a school makes it easier for a student to be formally arrested or 45 referred to juvenile justice for minor acts of misconduct that would otherwise be handled through 46 school discipline.63 This criminalization of school misconduct disproportionally impacts students of 47 color , as ev idenced in the existing racial disparities in arrest and incarceration.40 48 49 CSAPH Rep. 04-A-23 -- page 9 of 14 Proponents state that school districts often view SROs as the first line of defense against school 1 shootings and other acts of school violence. SROs also aim to act as a specialized form of 2 community policing, a model of policing designed to assign officers to permanent beats, involve 3 student s in decision-making, and problem- solve using non- criminal justice techniques such as 4 mentoring and informal sanctions .64 Consistent with this logic, research has shown that SROs may 5 improve student attitudes toward the police and improve student and staff perceptions of school 6 safety .26 7 8 The current evidence is inconclusive on the effectiveness of de-escalation training for SROs. 9 However, multi -faceted interventions are more likely to be effective, especially in school settings. 10 Examples of evidence -based best practices include training on restorative justice, transformative 11 justice, and trauma -sensitive or trauma-informed schooling.65 At the center of each of these 12 approaches is the development of: healthy relationships; processes that support the healing of harm 13 and transformation of conf lict; and just and equitable learning environments that confront 14 oppressive structures and systems.69 15 16 Further, e stablishing an agreed -upon operating protocol or MOU is considered a critical element of 17 an effective school -police partnership. T he MOU should include provisions addressing daily 18 interactions between students and school personnel with school resource officers.66 MOUs are 19 widely considered important tools to clarify how SROs should operate in an educational 20 environment.67 However, most school dis tricts employing SROs do not have a MOU in place. 21 Research shows that an upfront MOU agreement can result in fewer court referrals, fewer violent 22 offenses, and higher graduation rates.68 23 24 It is also important to recognize that SROs are part of the school staff at large and shouldn't be 25 considered a separate entity from school counselors, social workers, school psychologists, nurses, 26 and schoolteachers. Their roles should therefore be defined within the team structure of the school. 27 Finally, community -based policing practices ensure that the community plays a role in prioritizing 28 and addressing public safety proble ms.69 SRO programs employing these practices can be used to 29 accomplish two interrelated goals of developing solutions to problems through collabor ative 30 problem solving and improving public trust. 31 32 RECOMMENDATIONS 33 34 The Council on Science and Public Health recommends that the following be adopted, and the 35 remainder of the report be filed. 36 37 1. That our AMA amend Policy H-60.902, \"School Resource Officer Qualifications and 38 Training\" as follows: 39 1. Our AMA encourages: (1) an evaluation of existing national standards (and 40 legislation, if necessary) to have qualifications by virtue of training and 41 certification that includes child and adolescent psychology and development, 42 trauma -informed care , restorative justice, peer mediation, conflict resolution, crime 43 awareness, implicit/explicit biases, how to work with children with disabilities and 44 special needs, diversity inclusion, cultural humility competence of the distinct 45 cultural groups represented at schools, de -escalation training, and individual and 46 institutional safety and others deemed necessary for school resource officers; and 47 (2) the development of policies that foster the best environment for learning 48 through protecting the health and safety of those in school, including students, 49 teachers, staff and visitors. (Modify HOD Policy) 50 51 CSAPH Rep. 04- A-23 -- page 10 of 14 2. That our AMA encourage: (1) school districts initiating SROs develop and those with 1 existing SROs maintain an up- to-date Memorandum of Understanding (MO U) that clearly 2 outlines processes for officer selection and assessment, defines roles and responsibilities of 3 SROs and their scope relative to school personnel , identifies data to be collected, and 4 establishes a mechanism for program evaluation and oversight ; (2) SROs to have access to 5 local public health resources; (3) schools with SRO programs to collect and report data to 6 help evaluate the impact of SROs in schools ; and ( 4) federal and state grant programs 7 which provide funding for SRO programs , require collection and reporting of data to 8 inform policymaking on these programs . (New HOD Policy) 9 10 3. That our AMA acknowledges : (1) SRO s are part of the school staff at large and their 11 responsibilities should be defined within the team ; and (2) community -based policing 12 practices are essential for a successful SRO program.

The first Resolve of Resolution 001- A-22, \"Increasing Public Umbilical Cord Blood- Donations in Transplant Centers,\" which was referred by the House of Delegates, asked that our American Medical Association (AMA) \"encourage all hospitals with obstetrics pr ograms to make available to patients and reduce barriers to public (altruistic) umbilical cord blood donation .\" METHODS. English language articles were selected from searches of PubMed and Google Scholar using the search terms \"umbilical cord blood donati on,\" \"public umbilical cord blood donation,\" and \"umbilical cord blood AND transplantation .\" Additional articles were identified by manual review of the reference lists of pertinent publications. Web sites managed by government agencies and applicable organizations will also be reviewed for relevant information. DISCUSSION. Historically, umbilical cord blood (UCB) had no identified value and was disposed of with the placenta. When used in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, umbilical cord blood offers several distinct advantages compared with bone marrow or peripheral stem cells. Biologically, a greater degree of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatch is tolerated by the recipient and the incidence of acute graft -versus -host reaction is decreased when umbilical cord blood is used compared with unrelated donor bone marrow . The predominant disadvantage of umbilical cord blood use is that there is often a low yield of stem cells acquired per unit. In general, UCB can be donated to a private or public bank. A private umbilical cord blood bank is a for -profit company that allows storage of umbilical cord blood for personal use. In contrast, public umbilical cord blood banks offer gratuitous cord blood banking for individuals who meet the donation requirements . This report examines the benefits and limitations of public versus private umbilical cord blood banking. CONCLUSION. Cord blood banking has been developed to the point that around 800,000 units are being stored in public banks and over 4 million units in private banks worldwide. Although UCB units are not the answer for every patient needing a bone marrow transplant, th eir availability is crucial for hundreds of patients every year who have no alternative treatment modality. Despite the benefits of UCB donations, multiple barriers exist for cord blood collection. One notable barrier is that public UCB banks are required to process, and store collected units within 48 hours of collection. This limits the collection sites to proximally located hospitals. This provides a barrier for hospitals that lack the appropriate resources or infrastructure to UCB donations. This, coupl ed with the lack of funding for efforts to improve recruitment and education of expectant parents, leads to insufficient UCB donations and availability for transplant. Th e recommendations aim to address these barriers to improve and expand the current UCB donations and banking. This report also studies the financial costs of setting up public UCB banks and the long- term financial outlook for maintaining public UCB banks. REPORT OF THE COUNCIL ON SCIENCE AND PUBLIC HEALTH CSAPH Report 05- A-23 Subject: Increasing Public Umbilical Cord Blood Donation in Transplant Centers Presented by: Noel Deep, MD, Chair Referred to: Reference Committee D INTRODUCTION 1 2 The first Resolve of Resolution 001- A-22, \"Increasing Public Umbilical Cord Blood- Donations in 3 Transplant Centers,\" which was referred by the House of Delegates, asked that our American 4 Medical Association (AMA) \"encourage all hospitals with obstetrics programs to make available to 5 patients and re duce barriers to public (altruistic) umbilical cord blood donation.\" 6 7 BACKGROUND 8 9 Historically, umbilical cord blood (UCB) had no identified value and was disposed of with the 10 placenta. UCB is now known to contain hematopoietic stem cells that have potential life -saving 11 benefits . When used in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, umbilical cord blood offers several 12 distinct advantages compared with bone marrow or peripheral stem cells. Bi ologically, a greater 13 degree of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatch is tolerated by the recipient and the incidence 14 of acute graft -versus -host reaction is decreased when umbilical cord blood is used compared with 15 unrelated donor bone marrow.1 The predominant disadvantage of umbilical cord blood use is that 16 there is often a low yield of stem cells acquired per unit. Only 8-12 percent of umbilical cord blood 17 units have sufficient cell volume for transplant to a person weighing 80 kg (176 lb).2 In general, a 18 private UCB bank is a for -profit company that allows storage of UCB for personal use. In contrast, 19 public UCB banks offer gratuitous cord blood banking for individuals who meet the donation 20 requirements. The benefits and limitations of publi c versus private UCB banking should be 21 reviewed with the patient individually because they serve different purposes. 22 23 METHODS 24 25 English language articles were selected from searches of PubMed and Google Scholar using the 26 search terms \"umbilical cord blood donation,\" \"public umbilical cord blood donation,\" and 27 \"umbilical cord blood AND transplantation.\" Additional articles were identified by manual review 28 of the reference lists of pertinent publications. Web sites managed by government agencies and 29 applicabl e organizations were also reviewed for relevant information. 30 31 DISCUSSION 32 33 Umbilical Cord Blood 34 35 UCB is the blood left over in the umbilical cord and placenta after delivery. Typically, the 36 umbilical cord and placenta are thrown away as medical waste. UCB blood is similar to other 37 sources of blood because it contains red and white blood cells, platelets and plasma. It also contains 38 CSAPH Rep. 05- A-23 -- page 2 of 14 a special type of stem cell known as hematopoi etic stem cells (HSCs) that can mature or grow into 1 different types of blood cells such as red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets . Billions of 2 stem cells reside in just a few ounces of cord blood, which is collected painlessly from the 3 umbilical cord after birth. HSCs are used in treating life -threatening malignant and non- malignant 4 diseases of the blood and immune system .3 Researchers have found cord blood is effective in 5 treating up to 80 conditions .4 Moreover, clinical studies have proved the pluripotent nature of cord 6 blood cells, highlighting a wide range of possible clinical applications in neonatology, regenerative 7 medicine, and immune modulation. 8 9 Umbilical Cord Blood Banking 10 11 UCB banking has grown significantly in the past two decades. The option to bank UCB was first 12 made available in the 1990s following the discovery that cord blood is a rich source of stem cells .5 13 UCB banking consists of the collection and storage of the UCB from the placenta and umbilical 14 cord, soon after childbirth.6 15 16 Three types of UCB banks currently exist : public, private, and hybrid. Public banks store UCB 17 units received altruistically from donors, which are then listed on the Be The Match\u00ae Registry 18 (The Registry) and made available for any potential recipient if they are an adequate HLA match.7 19 There is no cost to donate the baby's cord blood to a public bank. Public banks follow strict quality 20 assurance and FDA regulations and will only bank cord blood if it is sterile and contains enough 21 stem cells to use in treatment. However , public cord blood banks do not allow directed storage. In 22 contrast, private banks, also referred to as family banks, store UCB for excl usive future use either 23 by the donor or a matched relative. When a baby's cord blood is stored in a private cord blood 24 bank, the donor pay s collection and ongoing storage fees and the UCB is reserved for the donor's 25 use only. As the cord blood is being saved for personal use, private banks are not required to follow 26 the same quality and sterility guidelines as a public bank.8 Hybrid banks offer combined public and 27 private UCB storage solutions. In this scenario , either the private bank offers a pu blic donation, or 28 the public bank offers a private storage option. 29 30 Recruitment and Donor Education 31 32 Public UCB banks are required to process, and store collected units within 48 hours of collection. 33 Therefore, collection tends to occur in geographically proximate hospitals, which is available in a 34 limited number of hospitals in the United States.9 This, coupled with the lack of funding for 35 marketing campaigns, means that recruitment and education of expectant parents provided by 36 publi c UCB banks is minimal, mostly consisting of websites to provide education and guidance to 37 expectant parents who want to donate their baby's cord blood. Most public UCB banks rely on the 38 voluntary participation of physicians, prenatal class instructors, and lab or and delivery nurses to 39 encourage expectant parents to donate, provide information about donation, and to collect the cord 40 blood at the time of delivery. Some public UCBs maintain their own staff in collection hospitals to 41 provide information and educati on about cord blood donation or consent -and-obtain information 42 for the maternal questionnaire. Further, many states have laws requiring obstetricians to inform 43 their patients about cord blood banking.10 However, most legislation does not specify whether 44 public or private donation should be discussed. 45 46 Cord Blood Collection, Processing, and Storage 47 48 Families who decide to donate their newborn's cord blood to a public UCB bank must provide a 49 maternal health history and a maternal blood sample for in fectious disease screening prior to 50 delivery. Collected cord blood is then packed, stored, and transported, typically in a temperature 51 CSAPH Rep. 05- A-23 -- page 3 of 14 monitored environment, to a cell -processing laboratory. While in transit from the collection site to 1 the processing and s torage site, time and temperature affect the viability of the cord blood: One 2 study reported a 1- percent drop in cell viability for every 4- hour increase in transit time.11 After 3 collection, but before further testing or processing, many public UCB banks perform an initial 4 assessment of the collected unit to determine its weight and volume. Low weight or volume units 5 are usually discarded or donated to research since they are unlikely to meet minimum cell count 6 requirements for banking and use in transplant s.12 7 8 At any point in the process, a cord blood unit may be identified as unsuitable for storage for any 9 number of reasons, including low volume (i.e., not enough stem cells to use in a transplant), poor 10 viability (i.e., there may be stem cells, but they may not be alive or appropriately functioning), poor 11 results from infectious disease testing, or negative findings from the maternal health questionnaire. 12 Some studies have demonstrated that for every one-hundred births eligible for cord blood donation 13 in which cord blood collection is attempted, approximately forty -five are sent for processing and 14 approximately ten are ultimately stored.13 15 16 Cord Blood Inventory Management and Withdrawal 17 18 Most cord blood stored i n public banks in the United States are listed with the National Marrow 19 Donation Program (NMDP ), which runs The Registry and serves as a central site for patients 20 seeking HSC transplants of all kinds.14 Many international banks' cord blood is also availabl e 21 through The Registry. Some public UCB banks may also offer units that do not meet qualifications 22 for being listed on The Registry but may still have value to potential recipients ( i.e., they may have 23 lower cell counts, but represent rare HLA types). Thes e are not available through The Registry, but 24 rather are obtained directly through established relationships with UCB banks. 25 26 When a patient has a condition that necessitates treatment using an allogeneic HSC transplant, the 27 patient's physician, whether in the United States or abroad, can search existing registries, including 28 The Registry, for a potential match. More than 90 percent of UCB units distributed for transplant in 29 the United States are distributed through The Registry.15 30 31 UMBILICAL COR D BLOOD REGULATION AND GOVERNMENT POLICIES 32 33 Federal Policies and Programs 34 35 In 1987, the National Bone Marrow Donor Registry (NBMDR) was initiated through a 36 congressionally directed grant from the U.S. Department of the Navy and formally established in 37 1990 as a responsibility of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), with 38 oversight initially by the National Institutes of Health (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Insti tute) 39 and, since 1994, by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA).16 In December 40 2005, Congress passed the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act (Stem Cell Act 2005).17 The 41 Stem Cell Act 2005 amended the Public Health Service Act and requi red the HHS Secretary, 42 through HRSA, to rewrite the provisions that established and maintained the NBMDR. The 43 provisions were rewritten to establish and maintain the C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation 44 Program (CWBYCTP), the successor to the NBMDR. 45 46 The Stem Cell Acts of 2005, 2010, 2015, 2021 authorize d the following: 47 48 The Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act of 2005 established the CWBYCTP to 49 replace the NBMDR. In so doing, the Act expanded on the previous requirements of the 50 NBMDR to increase the num bers of marrow donors and cord blood units and continued to 51 CSAPH Rep. 05- A-23 -- page 4 of 14 serve patients who need a bone marrow or umbilical cord blood transplant. The 1 CWBYCTP also established an outcomes database to collect data and perform research , as 2 well as offer patient and donor advocacy services, case management services, data 3 collection on transplant outcomes, and educational activities. 4 National Cord Blood Inventory (NCBI). The NCBI program contracts with cord blood 5 banks to meet the statutory goal of building a public invento ry of at least 150,000 new, 6 high- quality, and genetically diverse UCB units .18 These UCB units are available for 7 transplantation through the CWBYCTP. The Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research 8 Reauthorization Acts of 2010 also required the U.S. Government Accountability Office to 9 report on efforts to increase cord blood unit collection for the NCBI. 10 Advisory Council on Blood Stem Cell Transplantation (ACBSCT). The goal of the 11 ACBSCT is to advise, assist, consult with, and make recommendations to the Secretary o f 12 Health and Human Services and the Administrator of HRSA on matters carried out by both 13 CWBYCTP and the NCBI Program.19 14 15 HRSA 16 17 HRSA administers the CWBYCTP and manages its various components. HRSA provides funding 18 for the collection of diverse cord blood units for NCBI through contracts to cord blood banks . 19 There are 13 NCBI contractors who bid to provide a certain number of cord blood units of 20 specified types ( i.e., rac ial/ethnic groups).20 Once NCBI -eligible cord blood units are listed on The 21 Registry, public cord blood banks receive a subsidy for cord blood collection, processing, and 22 storage. This subsidy does not cover the entire costs borne by cord blood banks for collection, 23 processing, and storage, but it does help defray some of those costs. 24 25 National Marrow Donor Program (NMD P) 26 27 The NMDP provides the link between HRSA, UCB banks , and physicians for obtaining stem cells 28 and, specifically, cord blood. The NMDP also acts as the financial intermediary between individual 29 UCB banks and hospitals and provides education for patients and clinicians.21 30 31 FDA Oversight 32 33 The FDA regulates cord blood in a variety of ways, depending on the source, the processing, and 34 the intended use. Cord blood stored in private banks (i.e., for autologous use or use in first - or 35 second -degree relatives) does not need to go through FDA licensure because it is used on the 36 individual from whom it was collected, or on a r elated individual. In contrast, public 37 UBC banks store UCB units intended for use by a patient unrelated to the donor ( i.e., for allogeneic 38 use). Therefore, this use meets the legal definitions of both a \"drug\" and a \"biological 39 product,\" which means that public UBC banks must adhere to additional requirements.22,23 Public 40 banks are required to comply with good tissue practice regulations, conduct specific donor 41 screening and infectious disease testing, conduct standardized testing on UCB units , and maintai n 42 international cellular therapy accreditation. Further, public UCB banks are required to hold 43 licensure from the FDA. The costs and timeline for achieving FDA licensure are reportedly high, 44 with many public UC B banks reporting a 12- to-24-month timeline, initial costs of approximately 45 $1 million, and ongoing annual costs of more than $100,000.24,25 46 47 It is also important to note that individual UCB unit s are licensed, not the UCB bank itself. 48 Most public UCB banks in the United Sta tes were in operation before the FDA licensure 49 mandate \u2014the FDA issued guidelines for licensure in 2009 and issued the first license in 2011.26 50 Licensed UBC units meet FDA standards, and unlicensed UBC units are collected and processed 51 CSAPH Rep. 05- A-23 -- page 5 of 14 prelicensure or are post -licensure collections that do not meet the requirements specified by the 1 FDA. Public UCB bank s that have not achieved FDA licensure will produce only unlicensed 2 UCB s. Finally, UCB units from international banks are also unlicensed. The use of an unlice nsed 3 UBC unit must go through the process of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application.27 An 4 IND may be submitted by the UCB bank , the transplant physician, the transplant center, a national 5 or international cord blood registry involved in coordinating the distribution, or another qualified 6 sponsor.27 INDs are granted only for specific uses.26 7 8 State Legislation 9 10 To date, 28 states have passed some form of cord blood education legislation, which represents 78 11 percent of the total annual US births.10 Several other states are in various stages of developing 12 similar legislation to help inform health care professionals and expectant parents of all medically 13 appropriate options for preserving cord blood stem cells. 14 15 ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF USING CORD BLOOD STEM CELLS 16 17 Advantages of Using Cord Blood Stem Cells O ver Other Sources for Stem Cells 18 19 Physicians and patients balance trade -offs when choosing a suitable stem cell donation for 20 transplant. In some cases, the urgency to perform the tr ansplant makes cord blood stem cells the 21 preferred choice because they are usually available for overnight transport once a suitable match is 22 identified.28 Other factors to consider include time to acquire the donation and quality of the 23 potential stem cel l sources, as well as the patient's age and disease. One major advantage to using 24 cord blood stem cells i s the fact that they are less differentiated than stem cells from adult sources 25 (i.e., bone marrow or peripheral blood) , and therefore are better able to develop into various cell 26 types as they mature. This quality is an asset for transplantation because cord blood stem cells 27 require less -stringent donor -recipient matching than adult stem cells and carry a lower risk for 28 rejection by the recipient's body. Another advantage is that t his less-strict matching also implicitly 29 increases access to stem cells as a treatment source for those unable to find suitable matches among 30 other sources .29 This is especially important for racial and ethnic minorities who often have a hard 31 time finding a suitable donor. 32 33 Bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cell collection also have disadvantages. Preparations for 34 collection of bone marrow or peripheral blood, such as donor -recipient matching to minimize the 35 chance of rejection, can take several weeks to complete. Collection itself requires the donor to 36 undergo a procedure requiring sedation, typically done in an operating room, or take medication to 37 stimulate stem cell production, both of which can be painful and can require recovery in the 38 hospital.30 39 40 Summary of Advantages for Patients 41 42 For certain patients, there may be advantages to using donor cord blood stem cells instead of donor 43 peripheral blood or donor marrow stem cells. Some potential advantages include : 44 45 Availability . Cord blood stored in a public cord blood bank has been prescreened, tested and frozen 46 and is ready to use. They are usually available for overnight transport once a suitable match is 47 identified.31 48 49 Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) Matching. The outcomes of related and unrelated donor stem 50 cell transplants are strongly affected by the degree of HLA matching be tween the transplant 51 CSAPH Rep. 05- A-23 -- page 6 of 14 recipient and the donor cord blood. HLA matching plays an important role in successful 1 engraftment, severity of graft -versus -host disease (GVHD) and overall survival. A close match 2 between the patient and the cord blood unit can improv e a patient's outcome after transplantation.31 3 4 Graft -Versus- Host Disease . Studies have found that after a cord blood stem cell transplant, fewer 5 patients got GVHD and, among those patients who did develop GVHD, the complication tended to 6 be less severe th an it was in patients who had bone marrow or peripheral blood transplants. GVHD 7 is a serious and sometimes fatal complication of allogeneic stem cell transplantation.31 8 9 Diversity . As a result of extending collection efforts to hospitals where births from diverse ethnic 10 backgrounds are well represented, donated cord blood units have the potential to provide a source 11 of stem cells that reflect racial and ethnic diversity.31 12 13 Infectious Disease Transmission . Cord blood stem cell transplants carry a lower risk of 14 transmission of blood -borne infectious diseases compared with stem cells from the peripheral 15 blood or marrow of related or unrelated donors.31 16 17 Disadvantages of Using Cord Blood Stem Cells Over Other Sources for Stem Cells 18 19 Although the U.S. government started a federal cord blood program in 2005 to help create a 20 nationwide inventory of high quality and genetically diverse units of cord blood, the proportion of 21 cord blood stem cell transplants relative to transplants using other types of stem cells, such as those 22 from bone marrow, has been falling in recent years.32 The declining demand and increasing costs 23 has led to some of the public UBC banks to struggle to operate financially. 24 25 One significant disadvantage to using cord blood stem cells is that the volume of collectible blood 26 is small in comparison to that from an adult donor's bone marrow or peripheral blood. Fewer stem 27 cells means that it takes approximately 10 -15 days longer than other sources for the stem cells to 28 establish themselves when introduced in the recipient's bone marrow.33 This means longer 29 recovery time in the hospital for the recipient. S ince bone marrow and peripheral blood can provide 30 more stem cells per donation, the cells usually engraft more quickly in the recipient's bone marrow, 31 so the recipient typically has a shorter recovery period. Further, bone marrow or other peripheral 32 blood stem cell s are not required to be licensed. 33 34 Summary of Disadvantages for Patients 35 36 Clinical Data . Cord blood stem cell transplantation is almost two decades old yet is a relatively new 37 procedure in comparison to transplantation of peripheral blood or marrow stem cells. It is possible 38 that genetic diseases may be present but not apparent at the time of birth and could be transplanted 39 to a patient via donor cord blood stem cells. Procedures to track this possibility require follow -up 40 until the donor infant is m onths or even years old, but s uch follow -up has proven difficult. A future 41 approach to address this may be genetic testing for diseases that affect the blood and immune 42 system and for certain metabolic diseases that might be transplantable.31 43 44 Storage . It is not known how long cord blood can be frozen and stored before it loses its 45 effectiveness. Cord blood samples have been preserved for as long as 10 years and have still been 46 successfully transplanted.31 47 48 Engraftment . The number of cells required to give a transplant patient the best chance for 49 engraftment and for surviving the transplant is based on his or her weight, age and disease status. A 50 cord blood unit might contain too few stem cells for the recipient's size. Due to the smaller number 51 CSAPH Rep. 05- A-23 -- page 7 of 14 of stem cell s in the cord blood unit, cord blood stem cell transplants engraft more slowly than stem 1 cells from marrow or peripheral blood. Until engraftment occurs, patients are at risk of developing 2 life-threatening infections due to immunosuppression from chemother apy and/or radiation intended 3 to prepare the recipient for the transplant . Thus, cord blood transplant recipients may be vulnerable 4 to infections for an average of up to one to two months longer than marrow and peripheral blood 5 stem cell recipients. 31 6 7 CURRENT DEMAND FOR CORD BLOOD UNITS 8 9 Overall, stem cell transplants have been on the rise for several years. However, the number of 10 transplants using cord blood has declined over time, from about 12 percent of all HSC transplants 11 to about 8 percent from 2010 to 2015.34 As of 2020, m ore than three -quarters (77%) of the 12 unrelated transplants and three- quarters (80%) of related transplants were performed using 13 peripheral blood.35 One -seventh (14%) of unrelated transplants used bone marrow and 7% used 14 cord blood units.35 Other factors may contribute to the declining demand for cord blood, such as 15 higher procurement and treatment costs or provider preferences. Over the short term, t reatment 16 costs are clearly higher for cord blood transplants relative to other stem cell transplants. This is 17 primarily driven by longer engraftment periods, which translate into longer hospital stays. Research 18 is still needed to determine whether cord blood recipients stay healthier over the long term than 19 recipients of other stem cell types. Further, d ifferences in collection costs are also unclear, as 20 previous studies have tended to ignore the cost of harvesting adult stem cell sources, which can be 21 significant.34 22 23 Competition among public banks has increased as the net supply of cord blood units has grown. 24 Private banks, in which individuals store cord blood for their own family use, also provide some 25 competition because their units may not be released t o the national inventory, keeping that segment 26 of the market off -limits for most patients. In addition, international cord blood banks now supply 27 about 24 percent of units used in the United States, up from 13 percent in 2004.36 The fee that a 28 bank charges a transplant center for a cord blood unit tends to be the same (about $36,000) 29 regardless of the unit's TNC count or genetic rarity.34 The current market environment for public 30 banks makes it difficult to break even. Costs for public banks include processing, testing, and 31 storage costs; licensure by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; and overhead costs. The total 32 expenses vary widely, ranging from $1 million to $6 million, depending on the size of the 33 operation.37 Further, revenue primarily comes from fees, but also from the NCBI subsidies for 34 registered units, donations, grants, or in- kind donations of services. Banks collect, on average, 35 8,500 units annually but ultimately store only 5 to 40 percent of those collections.38 Among units 36 that have been banked, a low -TNC -count unit has only about a 0.1- percent chance of being used in 37 a given year, as opposed to a 3- percent chance for larger units.37 Because banks collect fees only on 38 units that are used, banks that store low -TNC -count units are more likely to lose money. 39 40 EQUITY CONSIDERATIONS 41 42 In the U.S., racial minorities are much less likely to find a suitable blood stem cell donor than 43 White Americans. For example, a Black person has a 2 9 percent chance of finding a matched donor 44 in the registry, while a white person has a 7 9 percent chance.39 People who are American Indian 45 and Alaska Native have a 60 percent chance of finding a registry match, Asian and Pacific Islander 46 patients 4 7 percent, and Hispanic or Latino patients 48 percent.39 People of color make up a small 47 percentage of all donors, making it difficult to find matches for people with cancer who are not 48 white or who are of mixed race and ethnicity. 49 CSAPH Rep. 05- A-23 -- page 8 of 14 HSCs from UCB offer the advantage of requiring less stringent HLA -matching criteria ( i.e., six 1 loci, rather than 10 as is the case for bone marrow derived HSCs). In addition, since these cells can 2 be cryopreserved, this provides an off -the-shelf solution to patients in urgent need of 3 transplantation. These factors are particularly advantageous for patients from non -Caucasian racial 4 and ethnic groups, especially since this offers access to a worldwide inventory and increased the 5 likelihood of finding a match.40,41 6 7 As discussed above, one disadvantage of using UCB is the low yield of HSCs when compared to 8 bone marrow or peripheral blood. Use of a suboptimal HSC cell dose results in delayed recovery, 9 higher graft failure rates and risk of infection.45,42 This results in increased hospitalization times 10 and a consequent increase in treatment costs. Double UCB transplantation is often employed to 11 overcome this , causing significant financial burd ens to the transplant recipient. The cost factor is 12 particularly pertinent in the context of allogeneic UCB transplantation, when one considers that 13 obtaining a single UCB unit can cost up to $3 6,000.43 The costs of double UCB unit transplantation 14 and furt her manipulations can therefore be prohibitively expensive. 15 16 POTENTIAL COST CONSIDERATIONS 17 18 Limited information is available about the costs to set up an UCB donation systems in health care 19 settings where a program currently does not exist. As noted above, public UCB banks are required 20 to process, and store collected units within 48 hours of collection. This is essential to maintain the 21 viability of the collected cells. Therefore, this may only be feasible when a public UCB bank is 22 geographically proximate to the hospital. There are s ignificant costs for hospitals to set up public 23 UCB donation centers on site. One example of the potential fiscal cost comes from Connecticut 24 which aimed to establish a public UCB bank between the Department of Public Health (DPH) and 25 the University of Connecticut Health Center (UCHC).44 The estimated costs were $1.9 million , 26 with ongoing annual operating costs of $2.38 million for the subsequent years.43 Thes e estimates 27 assumed a volume of 1,440 specimens to be collected and stored per year and included costs for 28 personnel, equipment, training, accreditation, reagents, rent, vehicles for transport, freezers, testing, 29 courier services, and computer maintenance.43 30 31 Public U CB banks with donation systems in place incur both variable and fixed costs. Variable 32 costs include costs of collection, testing, processing, storing, and distributing the unit.37 Fixed costs 33 include obtaining FDA licensure and overhead costs, such as rent.37 Collection costs include costs 34 of recruiting donors, collection kit supplies, and labor costs. These costs may vary based on 35 the recruitment efforts conducted, as well as whether the bank uses volunteer CBU collectors , or 36 whether it employ s its own CBU collectors. There are also significant costs at the processing stage, 37 including separation of the CBU components and HLA -typing to prepare the units for storage.37 38 Further, t he costs banks typically incur to obtain the FDA license are not publicly available. 39 Therefore, a verage annual overhead costs \u2014which consist of equipment costs, maintenance, rent, 40 utilities, office supplies, and other related expenses\u2014 total from $1.2 million t o $4.5 million, 41 depending on the size and setup of the UCB bank.37 42 43 Revenue comes primarily from fees, but also from the NCBI subsidies for registered units, 44 donations, grants, or in- kind donations of services. Banks collect, on average, 8,500 units annua lly 45 but ultimately store only 5 to 40 percent of those collections.34 Because banks collect fees only on 46 units that are used, banks that store low -TNC -count units are more likely to lose money. Banks 47 have had to get creative with how they structure their b usinesses to remain viable. Some banks 48 have adopted hybrid models, offering private family banking to cross- subsidize the nonprofit 49 public banking operations under NCBI.34 Some have also improved their financial situation by 50 selling their processing or testing services to private banks.34 Others are part of larger 51 CSAPH Rep. 05- A-23 -- page 9 of 14 organizations, such as whole blood centers or hospitals, which can offer cheaper transportation and 1 lab work.34 Despite the current financial limitations , one study calculated that the average ann ual 2 value of having a national public bank system range from $883 million to $1.7 billion, far 3 outweighing the aggregate industry operational costs of $60 million to $70 million to maintain the 4 current system.34 5 6 Other limitations to collecting UCB include the lack of delivery rooms, licensed obstetric nurses, 7 and the need for more extended opening hours at the local public cord blood bank.45 This highlights 8 the other potential cost considerations that might increase UCB donations at current hospitals with 9 existing systems set up. 10 11 FEDERATION OF MEDICINE POLICY 12 13 The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists support public UCB donations and state 14 that public banking is the recommended method of obtaining cord blood. They further state that the 15 routine use of private cord blood banking is not supported by availabl e data.46 In addition, the 16 importance of contributions from all ethnicities and races to public banks is highlighted. The 17 American Academy of Pediatrics also support s the use of public cord blood banking, and further 18 state that it is the preferred method of collecting, processing, and using cord blood cells for use in 19 transplantation in infants and children with fatal diseases, such as malignancies, blood disorders, 20 immune deficiencies, and metabolic disorders.47 21 22 Existing AMA Policy 23 24 The AMA has policy addressing the use of cord blood for transplantation. Code of Medical Ethics 25 6.1.5 \" Umbilical Cord Blood Banking\" states that cord blood is a potential source of stem and 26 progenitor cells with possible therapeutic applications. Further it states that \"physicians who 27 provide obstetrical care should be prepared to inform pregnant women of the various options 28 regarding cord blood donation or storage and the potential uses of donated samples.\" It also 29 encourages donation to a public bank. The Code of Medical Ethics 7.3.8 \" Research with Stem 30 Cells \" urges physicians who conduct research using stem cells obtained from any source 31 (established tissue, umbilical cord blood, or embryos ) to adhere to institutional review board (IRB) 32 requirements , ensure that the research is carried out with appropriate oversight and monitoring, 33 ensure that the research is carried out with appropriate informed consent. 34 35 AMA Policy H -370.970 \"Umbilical Cor d Blood Transplantation: The Current Scientific 36 Understanding \" urges physicians to recognize the viability of UCB transplantation as an alternative 37 to bone marrow transplantation. It also encourages the education of physicians and the public on 38 UCB donation. Finally, AMA Policy H-370.956 \"Increasing Public Umbilical Cord Blood- 39 Donations in Transplant Centers\" encourages the availability of altruistic cord blood donations in 40 all states and access to public cord banking and the creation of public cord blood b anks to support 41 altruistic cord blood donation. 42 43 CONCLUSION 44 45 The UCB field has come a long way after 30 years of biomedical and clinical research supported 46 by public and private cord blood banking. Over 40,000 UCB transplants have been performed, both 47 in children and in adults, for the treatment of around 80 different medical disorders. Cord blood 48 banking has been developed to the point that around 800,000 units are being stored in public banks 49 and over 4 million units in private banks worldwide. Although U CB units are not the answer for 50 every patient needing a bone marrow transplant, their availability is crucial for hundreds of patients 51 CSAPH Rep. 05- A-23 -- page 10 of 14 every year who have no alternative treatment modality. Particularly, cord blood transplants can be 1 critical for pediatric and minority populations. Although sometimes there are alternatives to cord 2 blood, patients often have no appropriate alternative HSC source. In addition, the importance of 3 getting treatment quickly for some patients can make UCB units the best choice com pared with 4 other HSC sources that require greater lead time. 5 6 Changes in technology or new research findings related to the use of HSCs might increase or 7 decrease the future use of cord blood. Although c linical trials using cord blood typically address 8 rare diseases, research efforts are underway studying new cord blood applications to treat diabetes, 9 traumatic brain injury, stroke, cerebral palsy, and autism. Any new medical applications for cord 10 blood could increase demand for UCB units . There is also research on HSC expansion and related 11 technologies that could increase the utility of small CBUs. 12 13 Despite the benefits of UCB donations , multiple barriers exist for cord blood collection. One 14 notable barrier is that p ublic UCB banks are required to process, and store collected units within 48 15 hours of collection. This limits the collection sites to proximally located hospitals . This provides a 16 barrier for hospitals that lack the appropriate resources or infrastructure to UCB donations. This, 17 coupl ed with the lack of funding for efforts to improve recruitment and education of expectant 18 parents, leads to insufficient UCB donations and availability for transplant . Most public UCB 19 banks rely on voluntary participation of staff to encourage expectant pa rents to donate, provide 20 information about donation, and to collect the cord blood at the time of delivery. It should be noted 21 that time of delivery is not optimal for appropriate consent, adding another limitation to umbilical 22 cord blood donation. Further , some public UC Bs maintain their own staff in collection hospitals 23 with collection sites to provide information and education about cord blood donation. 24 25 RECOMMENDATIONS . 26 27 The Council on Science and Public Health recommends the following be adopted, and the 28 remainder of the report be filed. 29 30 1. That our AMA amend Policy H -370.956 \"Increasing Public Umbilical Cord Blood- 31 Donations in Transplant Centers \" as follows: 32 1. Our AMA encourages: (1) the availability of altruistic cord blood donations in all 33 states; and (2) access to public cord banking and the creation of public cord blood 34 banks to support altruistic cord blood donation. ; (3) all hospitals that provide 35 obstetri cs services work to provide access to public (altruistic) umbilical cord 36 blood donation ; (4) that when available , to reduce barriers through education of 37 patient s about altruistic umbilical cord donation ; and (5) that hospitals providing 38 obstetrics services and umbilical cord blood banking facilities work together to 39 create networks to expand access to and increase efficiency of altruistic umbilical 40 cord donations . 41 2. Our AMA supports federal funding efforts to increase knowledge sharing acr oss 42 banks and mentoring for centers , physicians , and staff with minimal experience in 43 cord blood collection. 44 3. AMA advocates for increased federal and state funding for public UCB banks to 45 create networks to expand access to and increase efficiency of altrui stic umbilical 46 cord donations in areas lacking the appropriate infrastructure to effectively collect 47 umbilical cord blood donations. 48 4. Our AMA supports efforts to educate physicians about best practices in collecting 49 public umbilical cord blood donations. 50 CSAPH Rep. 05- A-23 -- page 11 of 14 5. Our AMA encourages efforts to increase the diversity of the national inventory of 1 umbilical cord blood through funding that supports banks to add collection sites 2 where more racial and ethnic minority cord blood uni ts can be collected .

REPORT 06 OF THE COUNCIL ON SCIENCE AND PUBLIC HEALTH (A- 23) Study of Best Practices for Acute Care of Patients in the Custody of Law Enforcement or Corrections (Reference Committee D) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY INTRODUCTION. AMA Policy D- 430.993, \"Study of Best Practices for Acute Care of Patients in the Custody of Law Enforcement or Corrections,\" as adopted by the House of Delegates (HOD), asked that our American Medical Association (AMA) study best practices for interactions between hospitals, other acute care facilities, clinicians, and members of law enforcement or correctional agencies to ensure that patients in custody are provided the autonomy and privacy protections afforded to them by law and report its findings to the AMA House of Delegates by the 2023 Annual Meeting. METHODS. English language articles were selected from searches of PubMed and Google Scholar using the search terms \"acute care of patients in custody\", \"acute care AND corrections,\" and \"acute care AND i ncarceration.\" Additional articles were identified by manual review of the reference lists of pertinent publications. Web sites managed by government agencies and applicable organizations were also reviewed for relevant information. BACKGROUND. The U.S. has the highest incarceration rate in the world with 1.9 million people incarcerated nationwide . Incarcerated individuals typically have high rates of psychiatric conditions, communicable diseases, substance use disorders, and chronic diseases. Federal law mandates basic health care for individuals who are incarcerated. Few states have stand -alone hospitals for incarcerated patients, and in some counties, health departments offer expanded on- site services in their jails, including urgent care facilities. How ever, when medical care required by an individual who is incarcerated exceeds the capabilities of the correctional facility's health care services, that individual is transferred to a contracted hospital or, in emergent cases, to the nearest health care in stitution. Health care professionals practicing outside of correctional facilities receive little dedicated training in the care of incarcerated patients, are unaware of guidelines for the treatment of patients in custody, and face unique medical, legal, a nd ethical issues. This report primarily focuses on acute care for patients who interact with law enforcement. It outlines the constitutional rights to health care for incarcerated individuals and the rights for privacy of health information, as well as w hen that health information may be disclosed. The report also provides recommendations in support of developing standardized best practices and provides best practices should ensure security measures do not interfere with the capacity to provide care for incarcerated individuals. CONCLUSION. Information on best practices and management of medical conditions among hospitalized patients who are incarcerated or interact with law enforcement is limited and primarily focuses on the care of pregnant individuals . The National Commission on Correctional Health Care remains the only national organization dedicated solely to improving correctional health care quality. This is done by establishing rigorous standards for health services in correctional facilities, operating a voluntary accreditation program for institutions that meet those standards, offering certification for correctional health professionals, conducting educational conferences and webinars, and producing industry- specific publications and other resources. \u00a9 2023 American Medical Association.

REPORT OF THE COUNCIL ON SCIENCE AND PUBLIC HEALTH CSAPH Report 06 -A-23 Subject: Study of Best Practices for Acute Care of Patients in the Custody of Law Enforcement or Corrections Presented by: Noel Deep, MD, Chair Referred to: Reference Committee D American Medical Association (AMA) Policy D -430.993, \"Study of Best Practices for Acute Care 1 of Patients in the Custody of Law Enforcement or Corrections,\" as adopted by the House of 2 Delegates (HOD), asked that our AMA study best practices for interactions between hospitals, 3 other acute ca re facilities, clinicians, and members of law enforcement or correctional agencies to 4 ensure that patients in custody of such law enforcement or correctional agencies (including patients 5 without decision- making capacity), their surrogates, and the clinicians caring for them are provided 6 the autonomy and privacy protections afforded to them by law and in concordance with 7 professional ethical standards and report its findings to the AMA House of Delegates by the 2023 8 Annual Meeting. 9 10 BACKGROUND 11 12 The U.S. has the highest incarceration rate in the world with 1.9 million people incarcerated 13 nationwide.1 People of color are incarcerated at higher rates in jails and prisons across the country, 14 which causes disproportionate economic, health, and social harms.2 15 16 Incarcerated individuals typically have high rates of psychiatric conditions, communicable 17 diseases, substance use disorders, and chronic diseases. Federal law mandates basic health care for 18 individuals who are incarcerated. Correctional facilities offer a range of health care services from 19 primary care to hospital -level care. Few states have stand -alone hospitals for incarcerated patients, 20 and in some counties, health departments offer expanded on- site services in their jails, including 21 urgent care facilities. However, when medical care required by an individual who is incarcerated 22 exceeds the capabilities of the correctional facility's health care services, that individual is 23 transferred to a contracted hospital or, in emergent cases, to the nearest health care institution. 24 Health care professionals practicing outside of correctional facilities receive little dedicated 25 training in the care of incarcerated patients, are unaware of guidelines for the treatment of patients 26 in custody, and fac e unique medical, legal, and ethical issues. 27 28 This report is specifically focused on acute care of patients in custody. Acute care is defined as a 29 patient who is treated for a brief but severe episode of illness, for conditions that are the result of 30 disea se or trauma, and during recovery from surgery.3 Acute care is generally provided in a 31 hospital by a variety of clinical personnel using technical equipment, pharmaceuticals, and medical 32 supplies to provide diagnosis, care and treatment of a wide range of acute conditions, including 33 injuries.4 34 CSAPH Rep. 06- A-23 -- page 2 of 11 METHODS 1 2 English language articles were selected from searches of PubMed and Google Scholar using the 3 search terms \"acute care of patients in custody\", \"acute care AND corrections,\" and \"acute care 4 AND incarceratio n.\" Additional articles were identified by manual review of the reference lists of 5 pertinent publications. Web sites managed by government agencies and applicable organizations 6 were also reviewed for relevant information. 7 8 DISCUSSION 9 10 Health of incarcerate d populations 11 12 Compared to the general population, individuals with a history of incarceration have worse mental 13 and physical health ; they are more likely to have high blood pressure, asthma, cancer, arthritis, and 14 infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, hepatitis C, and HIV.4,5 Several factors contribute to the 15 prevalence of mortality due to illness and disease in this population. The incarcerated population is 16 largely drawn from the most disadvantaged segments of society, with significant health care needs 17 but limited access to regular care.6 As a result, many incarcerated individuals arrive at correctional 18 facilities in poor health with conditions that were previously undiagnosed. 19 20 Once incarcerated, the conditions of confinement often have a negative impact on health. Stress 21 associated with institutional life, overcrowding, inadequate access to exercise, improper diet, 22 exposure to infectious diseases, and poor sanitation and ventilation can all contribute to mortality. 23 Further, while inc arcerated individuals have a constitutional right to health care, the access to and 24 the quality of the care in correctional facilities are variable.7 Insufficient resources play a key role 25 here, especially limited budgets and regulations that require corr ectional facilities to prioritize 26 treating certain diseases over others. Some facilities tend to focus on those medical conditions that 27 have immediate and broad impact within the facility, such as HIV and tuberculosis, but also have 28 the potential to spill over into the general population. As a result, treatment of other chronic 29 conditions, such as diabetes and heart or kidney problems, may drop in priority.8 With few 30 exceptions, nearly all chronic health conditions are more prevalent among incarcerated ind ividuals 31 than the general population. Finally, a major need is increased medical capacity in correctional 32 facilities. M ortality could be reduced if facilities were better equipped to detect acute chronic 33 conditions, such as elevated blood pressure, and re spond with adequate care.9 34 35 Women with a history of incarceration face a greater burden of disease than men with a history of 36 incarceration.10,11 For example, female offenders with a history of drug misuse were more likely 37 than their male counterparts to suffer from conditions such as tuberculosis, hepatitis, and high 38 blood pressure.21,22 Women with a history of incarceration are also at greater ri sk for HIV/AIDS, 39 HPV, and other sexually transmitted diseases.21,22 Women with a history of incarceration are also 40 more likely to have experienced childhood trauma and physical and sexual abuse than women who 41 are not involved in the criminal justice system, potentially explaining high levels of physical and 42 mental health problems among women who are incarcerated.22 43 44 The number of older adults (ages 50 years and above) in U.S. prisons is growing.12,13 Many 45 correctional facilities, however, are not equipped to address the special health needs of these 46 individuals.23 While incarcerated, some older adults do not receive adequate treatment for their 47 ailments, particularly mental health conditions.23,14 For example, one study found that only 18 48 percent of older a dults who are incarcerated were prescribed medication to treat their mental health 49 conditions.25 50 CSAPH Rep. 06- A-23 -- page 3 of 11 Constitutional right to correctional health care 1 2 Incarcerated individuals oftentimes need medical attention for ailments, injuries, and diseases. 3 However, t here can be misconceptions about an incarcerated individuals' medical rights among 4 physicians, medical administrators, prison and jail staff, and law enforcement officials. There have 5 been several landmark rulings regarding health care and incarceration. T wo of the major cases are 6 Estelle v. Gamble, (1976) and Farmer v. Brennan, (1994).15,16 In Estelle, the U.S. Supreme Court 7 held that failure to provide adequate medical care to incarcerated people as a result of deliberate 8 indifference violates the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment .5 9 The Supreme Court's decision in Farmer held that a prison official's deliberate indifference to a 10 substantial risk to a prisoner violated the Eighth Amendment and resulted in cruel and u nusual 11 punishment.6 These two cases provide guidance regarding the legal standards for access to health 12 care and deliberate indifference under the Eighth Amendment, but did not define the minimum 13 standards of for medical care in prisons and jails, or a pri soner -patient's rights in medical decision - 14 making.5,6 In practice, the standard for establishing an Eighth Amendment violation is very 15 challenging to meet. Federal courts have stated that to constitute deliberate indifference, \"treatment 16 must be so grossly incompetent, inadequate, or excessive as to shock the conscience or to be 17 intolerable to fundamental fairness .\"17 18 19 Clinical best practices 20 21 Best practices and management of medical conditions among hospitalized patients who are 22 incarcerated or interact wi th law enforcement is limited and primarily focuses on the care of 23 pregnant individuals. This demonstrates the need to create evidence -based guidelines in the acute 24 care setting for individuals who are incarcerated or who interact with law enforcement, and these 25 guidelines should balance the rights of the patient, the needs of the clinician, and the safety of the 26 institution and law enforcement. Multiple agencies at federal, state, and local levels possess 27 authority over correctional health care. The Federa l Bureau of Prisons (BOP) oversees the 28 provision of medical, dental, and mental health services in federal prisons. The vast majority of the 29 incarcerated, however, are held in state prisons and county jails, where standards vary by state and 30 by county. Som e facilities are accredited by private organizations, but this accreditation process 31 remains entirely voluntary, leaving the correctional health care system without a uniform set of 32 standards. 33 34 National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC) 35 36 Sever al professional organizations, including the American Medical Association, the American 37 Public Health Association, and later, the National Commission on Correctional Health Care 38 (NCCHC) , have since established national standards for correctional health car e.27 NCCHC's 39 origins date to the early 1970s, when an American Medical Association study of jails found 40 inadequate, disorganized health services and a lack of national standards. In collaboration with 41 other organizations, the AMA established a program that in 1983 became the NCCHC, an 42 independent, 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.18 Forty years later, NCCHC remains dedicated to 43 improving correctional health care quality. This is done by establishing rigorous standards for 44 health services in correctional faciliti es, operating a voluntary accreditation program for institutions 45 that meet those standards, offering certification for correctional health professionals, conducting 46 educational conferences and webinars, and producing industry- specific publications and othe r 47 resources.18 48 49 NCCHC's standards have provided uniquely valuable guidance to help correctional health 50 professionals and administrators improve the health of their incarcerated populations (and the 51 CSAPH Rep. 06- A-23 -- page 4 of 11 communities to which they return), increase efficiency of health services delivery, strengthen 1 organizational effectiveness, and reduce the risk of adverse legal judgments.18 Established by 2 health, mental health, legal, and corrections professions, NCCHC's standards cover the areas of 3 patient care and treatment, governance and a dministration, personnel and training, safety and 4 disease prevention, special needs and services, and medical -legal issues.18 The NCCHC is 5 impartial, unbiased, and dedicated only to recognizing and fostering quality in correctional health 6 care. NCCHC is th e only accrediting body authorized by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health 7 Services Administration that focuses on corrections.18 8 9 Medicaid Inmate Exclusion Policy 10 11 The Medicaid Inmate Exclusion Policy, established in the 1965 Social Security Amendments, 12 almost completely prohibits the use of federal Medicaid funding to care for incarcerated patients. 13 As a result, there is no incentive for correctional facilities that seek accreditation, and voluntary 14 accreditation rates remain low.19 Facilities often cite staff shortages and monetary and time costs as 15 barriers to accreditation.20 CMS has approved a first-of-its-kind Section 1115 demonstration 16 amendment allowing Medicaid to fund limited services for people incarcerated in California state 17 prisons, jails, and juvenile detention centers up to 90 days before their release .21 Under the 18 amendment, the state will seek to increase coverage, continuity of care, and service uptake in 19 carceral settings. Ten other states have applied for similar waivers, and bills in Congress seek to 20 provide a pathway to Medicaid coverage for all incarcerated individuals approaching release. 21 22 Health care privacy 23 24 The year 1996, marke d the enactment of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 25 (HIPAA) which w ould later be amended to provide clear guidelines regarding the privacy of a 26 patient's medical records.1 A main purpose of the Act was the protection of patient healt h 27 information (PHI) when it was electron ically received, handled or shared among health care -related 28 agencies and individuals. HIPAA specifies that certain entities that engage d in those processes are 29 \"covered entities.\"22 In general, a covered entity is defined as an agency that 1) electronically 30 transmits health care information for the purpose of reporting; 2) requests to review PHI in order to 31 secure authorization for the care of patients; and 3) electronically transmits PHI for the benefit of 32 payment and claims from a public or private entity.23 However, t here is confusion regarding the 33 privacy rights of incarcerated patients that needed clarificatio n. 34 35 The unique circumstances of incarceration required a separate section under the Act. That s ection, 36 titled \"Correctional institutions and other law enforcement custodial situations,\" addresses 37 permitted disclosures of PHI for prisoners.24 The language in the section is very broad to permit 38 disclosure in many circumstances. Covered entities may di sclose the PHI of inmates without their 39 authorization to correctional institutions or law enforcement officials who have lawful custody of 40 an inmate for the purpose of providing health care to the inmate or for the health and safety of the 41 inmate, other in mates, the officers and employees of the institution and others at the facility, and 42 those responsible for inmate transfer.25 Covered entities may also disclose the PHI of inmates 43 without authorization for law enforcement purposes on the premises of an ins titution and for the 44 administration and maintenance of the safety, security, and good order of the institution.9 These 45 provisions apply only to the release of the PHI of current inmates.9 46 47 Situations where information may be released include: 48 49 Court -Order ed Subpoenas, Warrants, or Summons: A hospital may release patient 50 information in response to a warrant or subpoena issued or ordered by a court, or a 51 CSAPH Rep. 06- A-23 -- page 5 of 11 summons issued by a judicial officer. The hospital may disclose only that information 1 specifically descri bed in the subpoena, warrant, or summons.17 2 Grand Jury Subpoenas: A hospital also may disclose patient information in response to a 3 subpoena issued by a grand jury. Only information specifically described in the subpoena 4 may be disclosed.17 5 Administrative Requests, Subpoenas, or Summons: An administrative request, subpoena, 6 or summons is one that is issued by a federal or state agency or law enforcement official, 7 rather than a court of law.17 8 Disclosures for Identification and Location Purposes: In response to a request by a law 9 enforcement official, a hospital may release certain limited information to the official for 10 purposes of identification and location of a suspect, fugitive, material witness, or missing 11 person.17 12 Victims of a Crime: In respo nse to a request by a law enforcement official, a hospital may 13 disclose information to the official about a patient who may have been the victim of a 14 crime, if the patient agrees to the disclosure. Such agreement may be oral but should be 15 documented.17 16 Custodial Situations: A hospital may disclose to a correctional institution or a law 17 enforcement official having lawful custody of an inmate or other individual information 18 about such inmate or individual if the institution or official represents that such i nformation 19 is necessary for the health and safety of the individual.17 20 21 When inmates are released, they have the same privacy rights under HIPAA as all other 22 individuals. Additionally, exclusions exist for safely transporting prisoners to and from medical 23 facilities. Further, HIPAA also includes provisions regarding inmates' ability to exercise 24 protections otherwise granted in the rule. Inmates are excluded from the right to receive notice of 25 possible uses and disclosures of PHI and of their rights and a covered entity's duties with respect to 26 PHI. HIPAA's notice requirement does not apply at all to correctional institutions that qualify as 27 covered entities.26 Inmates have no right to notice regarding PHI created during incarceration, and 28 correctional institutions are not required to send notices to inmates after release. 29 30 Medical Decision -Making 31 32 All patients, including people who are incarcerated, have the ri ght to make their own health care 33 decisions, including the right to refuse medical care. They also have the right to designate who 34 should make their medical decisions if they become incompetent or incapacitated.27 All patients 35 and their appointed surrogate medical decision -makers, have the right to be properly informed of 36 medical conditions, prognosis, diagnosis, risk and treatment alternatives through the process of 37 informed consent. Wardens, guards, sheriffs, and police officers are not court -appointed le gal 38 guardians and therefore cannot make medical decisions on behalf of incarcerated patients.12 39 40 Incarcerated individuals can appoint a surrogate medical decision -maker through a written advance 41 directive, medical power of attorney, or an oral order.12 Upo n intake into a prison or jail, the 42 incarcerated individual should be asked to list a medical decision -maker. If not asked by officials, 43 the individual can request that such a decision- maker be listed in their medical records.12 44 Physicians and medical staf f have an ethical and legal duty to adhere to the patient's decisions, 45 including through a surrogate decision- maker. Often, there is a misunderstanding among health 46 care professionals, jail and prison administrators, and law enforcement officials that heal th care 47 decisions can be made by wardens, sheriffs, guards, or police officers if an incarcerated patient is 48 incapacitated. Under medical ethics and most state laws, those officials do not have medical 49 decision -making authority for incapacitated prisoners. 50 CSAPH Rep. 06- A-23 -- page 6 of 11 An area of frequent confusion in medical decision -making for people who are incarcerated involves 1 a legally eligible or appointed surrogate decision -maker that is neither known and/or available.28 2 This can be problematic when people are experiencing housing insecurity or are under the 3 influence of drugs or alcohol when arrested. In cases when doctors and corrections officials do not 4 know a legally eligible or appointed medical decision- maker, states have codified the legal 5 hierarchy of me dical -decision making through various statutes.13 Many states recognize that 6 medical decisions for an incapacitated patient, without an appointed medical surrogate or proxy, 7 should be made on a familial basis. If a legal appointe d medical decision -maker cannot be located, 8 then a court must appoint one on behalf of the patient through the legal guardianship process. 9 10 In the event of a medical emergency, any contact, advance directive or guardianship information 11 that corrections or law enforcement officials have for a prisoner -patient should be given to medical 12 staff at the prison or jail infirmary or local hospital.29 Prison and law enforcement officials must 13 refrain from making medical treatment decisions on behalf of incarcerated patients, and doctors 14 must refrain from following treatment decisions made by such officials. It may even be necessary 15 for the hospital to use various means to attempt to determine the medical decision -maker if no 16 information is available from the patient, such as requesting their prison or jail medical records or 17 intake information.14 Regardless, physicians cannot delegate to prison and law enforcement 18 officials a prisoner -patient's medical decision -making authority. Those officials can make 19 recommendations regarding the safety of patients or physicians either in the prison or jail infirmary 20 or local hospital, but such recommendations should not interfere with the patient's treatment 21 protocol.14 If information is not available through an advance directive, appointed decision- making 22 surrogate or lineage, the healthcare staff will have to default to the best medical interest standard 23 for the prisoner -patient's care. 24 25 Forcible Medical Procedures 26 27 Several alarming cases of forced medical procedures performed on prisoners, in the form of 28 surgery or body cavity searches, have been reported. In Sanchez v. Pereira -Costillo , the First 29 Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with the plaintiff , that a surgical procedure conducted by doctors 30 at the direction of corrections officials in Puerto Rico had violated his rights.30 Prison staff thought 31 that the plaintiff had a cell phone hidden in his rectum. Despite X -rays and bowel movements 32 indicating there was no phone, staff at the R\u00edo Piedras Medical Center performed exploratory 33 surgery at the request of p rison officials. The Court of Appeals noted in its opinion that \"the 34 exploratory surgery of his abdomen\" violated the plaintiff's rights under the Fourth Amendment.15 35 Further more , one issue that affects prisoners with respect to forced treatment, involuntary body 36 cavity searches and medical decision -making is a doctor's dual loyalties, which can be problematic 37 in correctional health care.31 Physicians may work as employees or contractors at prisons and jails, 38 and sometimes have conflicts of interes t between their patients and employer. 39 40 Shackling 41 42 Shackling refers to a form of restraint using a physical or mechanical device to control the 43 movement of an incarcerated individuals' body or limbs.32 It has been highlighted those conditions 44 in which the limitations are imposed by shackling , such as the increased risk of thrombosis from 45 reduced mobility, or related to the shackle itself could predispose patients to unnecessary harm.31,33 46 In addition to physical harm or discomf ort, one study demonstrated that patient shackling was 47 negatively associated with health care professional empathy toward patients who were 48 incarcerated.34 In the United States, particular attention has been focused on the shackling of 49 incarcerated pregnant persons . The FIRST STEP Act of 2018 ban ned shackling of pregnant women 50 in federal custody from the date on which pregnancy is confirmed until their postpartum 51 CSAPH Rep. 06- A-23 -- page 7 of 11 recovery.35 The majority of women, however , are incarcerated in state prisons.36 Current ly, 22 1 states and the District of Columbia prohibit or limit shackling of pregnant women . States vary in 2 legislation , with some banning shackles during transport, childbirth, and postpartum , whereas other 3 states ban shackles only during labor and birth.37 4 5 Shackling policies for patients in custody should be differentiated from hospital restraint policies 6 for patients who are agitated or combative. Since s hackles are often placed for nonmedical reasons, 7 the treating clinician should determine whether appropriate care can be delivered with shackles in 8 place.38 Custody officials are then responsible for determining an alternative manner to safely 9 secure, or not secure, a patient who is incarcerated that allows for standards of me dical care to be 10 met. 11 12 Discharge Prescribing 13 14 Physicians may also be concerned that medications prescribed on discharge will be misused by 15 patients in the correctional system, causing physicians to restrict or reconsider certain classes of 16 medication in th e hospital or on discharge.39 Commonly diverted medications in the correctional 17 setting include opioids, benzodiazepines, stimulants, antipsychotics, and -aminobutyric acid 18 agonists.40 A study of incarcerated individuals found that 51.5 percen t of partici pants reported 19 using illicit substances during incarceration, most commonly alcohol (35 percent ) and cannabis 20 (37.9 percent ), followed by narcotics (14.6 percent ).41 A variety of psychotropic medications are 21 also misused in the correctional setting, although prescription medications lag behind more 22 common substances, such as alcohol and cannabis. Another study examining opioid agonist 23 therapies at a large jail, found that the medications for only 6 percent of patients were discontinued 24 during a month because of diversion concerns.42 Further, t here is no evidence that rates of diversion 25 are increased among patients who are incarcerated relative to those in a community setting, and the 26 monitored correctional environment may provide a safer setti ng for medications with diversion 27 risk.43 28 29 EXISTING AMA POLICY 30 31 AMA policy D -430.997 \"Support for Health Care Services to Incarcerated Persons\" supports 32 NCCHC standards that improve the quality of health care services, including mental health 33 services, d elivered to the nation's correctional facilities ; encourage s all correctional systems to 34 support NCCHC accreditation; and encourage s the NCCHC and its AMA representative to work 35 with departments of corrections and public officials to find cost effective an d efficient methods to 36 increase correctional health services funding . This policy also calls on the AMA to work with an 37 accrediting organization, such as NCCHC in developing a strategy to accredit all correctional, 38 detention and juvenile facilities and will advocate that all correctional, detention and juvenile 39 facilities be accredited by the NCCHC no later than 2025. 40 41 AMA policy H -315.975 \" Police, Payer, and Government Access to Patient Health Information\" 42 advocates for protection of PHI but notabl y advocates \"with respect to the final privacy rule or 43 other privacy legislation that no government agency, including law enforcement agencies, be 44 permitted access to medical records or individually identifiable health information (except for any 45 discretionary or mandatory disclosures made by physicians and other health care providers 46 pursuant to ethical guidelines or to comply with applicable state or federal reporting laws) without 47 the express written consent of the patient, or a court order or warrant permitting such access. \" 48 49 Further, AMA policy H -430.980 \" Compassionate Release for Incarcerated Patients \" supports 50 policies that facilitate compassionate release for incarcerated patients based on serious medical 51 CSAPH Rep. 06- A-23 -- page 8 of 11 conditions and advanced age . The Board of Trustees previously presented a report to the House of 1 Delegates on compassionate release for incarcerated in dividuals.44 2 3 CONCLUSION 4 5 The U.S. has the highest incarceration rate in the world. Compared to the general population, 6 individuals with a history of incarceration are in worse mental and physical health. Incarcerated 7 individuals typically have high rates of psychiatric conditions, communicable diseases, substance 8 use disorders, and chronic diseases. The U .S. Supreme Court has indicated that failure to provide 9 adequate medical care to incarcerated people as a result of deliberate indifference violates the 10 Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment . However, i n practice, 11 federal courts have stated that to constitute \"deliberate indifference, \" treatment must be so grossly 12 incompetent, inadequate, or excessive as to shock the conscience or to be intolerable to 13 fundamental fairness . 14 15 The principles of privacy and confidentiality apply to all patients, including those who are 16 incarcerated . HIPAA also equally applies to incarcerated individuals unless PHI disclosure is 17 necessary f or the provision of health care or safety of the patient, or other individuals in the 18 facility.8 Hospital security policies may contravene this principle of confidentiality. The policy at 19 many institutions requires that officers be permitted to always rema in with a patient in custody, and 20 although it is suggested that conversations be conducted out of hearing range, the officers must be 21 allowed to remain within direct sight of the patient.45 22 23 Information on best practices and management of medical conditio ns among hospitalized patients 24 who are incarcerated or interact with law enforcement is limited and primarily focuses on the care 25 of pregnant individuals. NCCHC remains the only national organization dedicated solely to 26 improving correctional health care q uality. This is done by establishing rigorous standards for 27 health services in correctional facilities, operating a voluntary accreditation program for institutions 28 that meet those standards, offering certification for correctional health professionals, conducting 29 educational conferences and webinars, and producing industry- specific publications and other 30 resources. AMA policy supports NCCHC standards. However, there is a need to incentivize 31 correctional facilities to pursue accreditation . 32 33 RECOMMENDATIONS 34 35 The Council on Science and Public Health recommends that the following be adopted, and the 36 remainder of the report be filed. 37 38 1. That our AMA amend policy D -430.993, \"Study of Best Practices for Acute Care of 39 Patients in the Custody of Law Enforcement or Cor rections\" to read as follows: 40 1. Our AMA will study best practices for interactions between hospitals, other acute 41 care facilities, clinicians, and members of law enforcement or correctional agencies 42 to ensure that patients in custody of such law enforcement or correctional agencies 43 (including patients without decision -making capacity), their surrogates, and the 44 clinicians caring for them are provided the autonomy and privacy protections 45 afforded to them by law and in concordance with professional ethical stan dards 46 and report its findings to the AMA House of Delegates by the 2023 Annual 47 Meeting. 48 49 1. Our AMA supports the development of : (1) best practices for acute care of patients 50 in the custody of law enforcement or corrections , (2) clearly defined and consistently 51 CSAPH Rep. 06- A-23 -- page 9 of 11 implemented processes between health care professionals and law enforcement that (a) 1 can best protect patient confidentiality, privacy, and dignity while meeting the needs of 2 patient s, health professionals, and law enfo rcement and (b) ensures security measures 3 do not interfere with the capacity to provide medical, mental health, pregnancy, end of 4 life/palliative , and substance use care, especially in emergency situations, and (3) a 5 hospital or health system -based health care professional and law enforcement liaison 6 team, that includes, but is not limited to, clinicians, members of the ethics committee, 7 hospital security, and legal services to serve as an immediate resource when questions 8 or conflicts arise. (Amend Current HOD Policy ) 9 10 2. That our AMA affirms that : (1) the adoption of best practices in the acute care of patients 11 in the custody of law enforcement or corrections is an important effort in achieving overall 12 health equity for the U.S. as a whole , and (2) it is the responsibility of the medical staff to 13 ensure quality and safe delivery of care for incarcerated patients. (New HOD Policy) 14 15 3. That our AMA reaffirm Policy D -430.997 \"Support for Health Care Services to 16 Incarcerated Persons\" and Policy H -420.957 \"Shackling of Pregnant Women in Labor.\" 17 (Reaffirm HOD Policy ) 18 Fiscal Note: less than $1,000 CSAPH Rep. 06- A-23 -- page 10 of 11 REFERENCES 1 Prison Policy Initiative.

REPORT 07 OF THE COUNCIL ON SCIENCE AND PUBLIC HEALTH (A- 23) Support Removal of BMI as a Standard Measure in Medicine and Recognizing Culturally- Diverse and Varied Presentations of Eating Disorders and Indications for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (Reference Committee D) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY INTRODUCTION. Resolution 407- A-22, referred by the House of Delegates, asked our American Medical Association to study the significant limitations and potential harms associated with the widespread use of body mass index (BMI) in clinical settings and study other validated, easily obtained alternatives to BMI for estimating risk of weight -related disease, and report its findings and report its findings to the AMA House of Delegates by the 2023 Annual Mee ting. While this report was in development, the HOD also referred Resolution 937- I-22, \"Indications for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery\" for consideration within this report. That resolution asked that our AMA acknowledge and accept the new American Societ y for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery and International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Disorders indications for metabolic and bariatric surgery. METHODS. English language articles were selected from searches of PubMed and Google Sch olar using the search terms \"Body Mass Index (BMI) ,\" to Surgery,\" and \"BMI AND culturally diverse.\" Additional articles were identified by manual review of the reference lists of pertinent publicat ions. Web sites managed by government agencies; applicable organizations were also reviewed for relevant information. BACKGROUND. Body mass index (BMI) is easy to measure, is inexpensive, has standardized cutoff points for overweight and obesity, and is s trongly correlated with body fat levels as measured by the most accurate methods. BMI is not a perfect measure, because it does not directly assess body fat. The current BMI classification system is also misleading regarding the effects of body fat mass on mortality rates. Numerous comorbidities, lifestyle issues, gender, ethnicities, medically significant familial -determined mortality effectors, duration of time one spends in certain BMI categories, and the expected accumulation of fat with aging are likel y to significantly affect interpretation of BMI data, particularly in regard to morbidity and mortality rates. Other methods to measure body fat are not always readily available, and they are either expensive or need to be conducted by highly trained personnel. Furthermore, many of these methods can be difficult to standardize across observers or machines, complicating comparisons across studies and time periods. Further, the use of BMI is problematic when used to diagnose and treat individuals with eating disorders, because it does not capture the full range of abnormal eating disorders. CONCLUSION. This report evaluates the problematic history of BMI and explores other alternatives to BMI. It outlines the harms and benefits to using BMI and points out tha t BMI is inaccurate in measuring body fat in multiple groups because it does not account for the heterogeneity across race/ethnic groups, sexes, and age -span. The recommendations recognize the issues with the use of BMI clinically, and highlights the need to use other methods. This report also acknowledges that AMA did not participate in the development of the \" Indications for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery\" guidelines and therefore cannot endorse these guidelines. \u00a9 2023 American Medical Association.

(Modify Current HOD Policy) 8 9 While this report was in development, the HOD also referred Resolution 937- I-22, \" Indications for 10 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery \" for consideration within this report. That resolution asked that 11 our AMA: 12 13 acknowledge and accept the new American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery and 14 International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Disorders indications for 15 metabolic and bariatric surger y; immediately call for full acceptance of these guidelines by 16 insurance providers, hospital systems, policy makers, and government healthcare delivery 17 entities ; and work with all interested parties to lobby the legislative and executive branches of 18 government to affect public health insurance coverage to ensure alignment with these new 19 guidelines . 20 21 BACKGR OUND 22 23 Body mass index (BMI) is the ratio of weight to height, calculated as weight (kg)/height (m2), or 24 weight (lb)/height (in2) multiplied by 703.1 BMI is easy to measure, is inexpensive, has 25 standardized cutoff points for overweight and obesity, and is strongly correlated with body fat 26 levels as measured by the most accurate methods. However, BMI is an indirect and imperfect 27 measurement as it does not distinguish between body fat and lean body mass. It is not as accurate 28 of a predictor of body fat in the elderly and at the same BMI women on average have more body 29 fat than men and Asians have more body fat than whites.1 Further, when combined with measuring 30 waist circumference, patients may be screened for possible health risks that come with being 31 overwei ght and having obesity. If most of the fat is around the waist rather than at the hips, an 32 individual is at a higher risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes.1 This risk goes up with a waist 33 size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 4 0 inches for men. 34 35 BMI is used because it is an inexpensive and easy tool. Research has shown that BMI is strongly 36 correlated with the gold- standard method for measuring body fat known as dual -energy x- ray 37 absorptiometry (DXA) , and it is an easy way for clinicians to screen who might be at greater risk of 38 health problems due to their weight .2 Other methods to measure body fat include skinfold thickness 39 measurements (with calipers), underwater weighing, bioelectrical impedance, and isotope dilution.2 40 However, these methods ar e not always readily available, and they are either expensive or need to 41 be conducted by highly trained personnel. Furthermore, many of these methods can be difficult to 42 standardize across observers or machines, complicating comparisons across studies and time 43 periods. 44 45 BMI is just one of several considerations to help determine a more specific and individualized 46 course of action for patients. Some researchersare advocating for a new kind of classification 47 system based on the concept of Adiposity- Based Ch ronic Disease (ABCD) \u2014 focusing more on 48 the health issues associated with obesity rather than body size alone.3 The diagnostic term reflects 49 both the pathophysiology and clinical impact of obesity as achronic disease. The proposed coding 50 system has four domains: pathophysiology, body mass index (BMI) classification, complications, 51 CSAPH Rep. 07- A-23 -- page 3 of 18 and complication severity; and incorporates disease staging, specific complications that impact 1 health, the basis for clinical intervention, individualized treatment goals and a personalized 2 medicine approach. 3 4 METHODS 5 6 English language articles were selected from searches of PubMed and Google Scholar using the 7 search terms \"Body Mass Index (BMI) ,\" \"alternatives to BMI ,\" \"BMI and Eating Disorders ,\" 8 \"Bariatric Surgery,\" and \"BMI AND culturally diverse. \" Additional articles were identified by 9 manual review of the reference lists of pertinent publications. Web sites managed by government 10 agencies; applicable organizations were also reviewed for relevant information. 11 12 DISCUSSION 13 14 Prevalence of obesity in the U.S. 15 16 In 2021, the CDC Adult Obesity Prevalence Map shows that obesity remains high. Nineteen states 17 and two territories currently have an obesity prevalence at or above 35 percent, more than doubling 18 from 2018.4 Adults with obesity are at increased risk for many other serious health conditions such 19 as heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, some cancers, and poorer mental health. Obesity also 20 disproportionately impacts some racial and ethnic minority groups.4 Non-Hispanic Black adults 21 had the highest prevalence of self -reporte d obesity (41.7 percent), followed by non -Hispanic 22 American Indian or Alaska Native adults (38.4 percent), Hispanic adults (36.1 percent), non- 23 Hispanic White adults (31.0 percent), and non- Hispanic Asian adults (11.7 percent).4 24 25 Childhood obesity is a serious problem in the United States that puts children and adolescents at 26 risk for poor health outcomes . From 2017- 2020, t he prevalence of obesity was 19.7 percent and 27 affected about 14.7 million children and adolescents.5 Obesity prevalence was 12.7 percent among 28 2- to 5- year-olds, 20.7 percent among 6- to 11- year-olds, and 22.2 percent among 12- to 19- year- 29 olds. Obesity prevalence was 26.2 percent among Hispanic children, 24.8 percent among non- 30 Hispanic Black children, 16.6 percent among non- Hispanic White children, and 9.0 percent among 31 non-Hispanic Asian children.5 Obesity -related conditions include high blood pressure, high 32 cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, breathing problems such as asthma and sleep apnea, and joint 33 problems.5 34 35 History of measures to calculate body weight (Body Build Index) 36 37 The concept of body fat as a major population -based medical issue gained popularity only shortly 38 before 1900. Life insurance data accumulated at that time and subsequently indicated that body 39 weight, ad justed for height (Wt/Ht), was an independent determinant of life expectancy, and in 40 1910, the effects of being overweight were noted to be greater for younger people than for the 41 elderly.6 The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in 1959 published tables of average body 42 weights for heights (Wt/Ht) , also known as body build, by gender and at different ages.7 This was 43 based on data from 1935 to 1953 from more than 4 million adults, mostly men, insured by 26 44 different insurance companies. The risk for develo pment of certain diseases as well as mortality 45 data related to Wt/Ht differences also were analyzed and reported in the 1960 Statistical Bulletin of 46 the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co.8 47 48 The Wt/Ht tables were used for many years as a reference for population -based studies. If a 49 person's Wt/Ht was 20 percent above or below the mean for that height category, they were 50 considered to be overweight or underweight, respectively.14 The insurance data also indicated the 51 CSAPH Rep. 07- A-23 -- page 4 of 18 ratios of weights for heights at which mortality was lowest in adults. The latter was referred to as 1 the \"ideal\" or later the \"desirable\" weight. F rom 1959 to 1983, the weight/height representing the 2 lowest mortality had increased.9,10 However, a \"desirable body\" weight for height was invariably 3 lower than the average weight for height in the insured population.15,16 4 5 Challenges with the wt/ht (body build ) index 6 7 Early on it was recognized that tall er people had a lower death rate than short er people with the 8 same Wt/Ht ratio.11 It also was recognized that a person's height in general and leg length could 9 affect the calculated body mass adjusted for height. A person's bone mass could also affect the 10 interpretation of this ratio. In gener al, it reflected whether one was narrowly or broadly built. Thus, 11 efforts were made to eliminate lower limb length and frame size as variables.13 The strategy was to 12 develop representations of body build, that is, charts of weight/height that were independ ent of 13 these variables. The overall goal was to have the same distribution of Wt/Ht at each level of height. 14 15 Although not stated, the implicit goal in developing these tables was to define a person's fat mass 16 as a proportion of their total mass, irrespect ive of their height or frame size.12 Efforts were made to 17 adjust for frame size (nonfat mass) by categorizing people as those with a small, medium, or large 18 frame. Estimation of frame size was attempted using several measurements including shoulder 19 width, elbow width, knee width, ankle width, and so on.13 None of these were widely adopted. 20 Further , frame size based on elbow width was included in the Metropolitan Life weight/height 21 tables, even though it was never validated.13 22 23 Adoption of the BMI as an inde x of obesity 24 25 In 1972, the validity of Metropolitan Life Insurance published data was criticized .14 Critics 26 supported the us e of the better documented weight for height data, which then popularized what is 27 known as the Quetelet Index . The Quetelet Index was later known as an individual's body mass 28 index (BMI). Howeve r, it was noted that e ven BMI rather poorly represents a person's percent of 29 body fat.20 Despite all the criticisms, the Metropolitan Life Tables criteria for defining obesity were 30 wide ly used in the United States until the early 1990s.15,16 At about that time, the World Health 31 Organization (WHO) classification of body weight for height, based on the BMI, was published, 32 and later it was widely adopted.17,18 The distribution of BMIs in adult American men and women 33 was determined in 1923 in 1026 individuals.19 The median BMI was 24, but the mean BMI was 25. 34 The distribution curve indicated a skewing toward an increase in BMI, and this trend has 35 continued.24 36 37 WHO and the categorization of BM Is into quartiles 38 39 In 1993, the WHO assembled an Expert Consultation Group with a charge of developing uniform 40 categories of the BMI. The results were published as a technical report in 1995.20 Four categories 41 were established: underweight, normal, overweight, and obese. An individual would be considered 42 underweight if their BMI was in the range of 15 to 19.9, normal weight if the BMI was 20 to 24.9, 43 overweight if the BMI was 25 to 29.9, and obes e if it was 30 to 35 or greater.26 44 45 At the time that the WHO classification was published, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 46 the United States classified people with a BMI of 27.8 (men) and 27.3 (women) or greater as being 47 overweight. If they wer e below this BMI, they were considered to be \"normal.\" This was based on 48 an 85 percent cutoff point of people examined in the National Health and Nutrition Examination 49 Study (NHANES) II.21 Subsequently, in 1998, the cutoff point between normal and overweight was 50 reduced to a BMI of 25 to bring it into line with the 4 categories in the WHO guidelines.22 This 51 CSAPH Rep. 07- A-23 -- page 5 of 18 then changed the categoriz ation of millions of Americans from being \"normal weight\" to being 1 \"overweight.\" 2 3 In Western population- based studies, the mean or median BMI was about 24 to 27.23,24 Therefore, 4 the consequence of adopting the WHO classification resulted in approximately 50 percent or more 5 of the general adult population being classified as overweight and obese. Indeed, the term 6 \"overweight\" or p articularly \"preobesity\" is prejudicial since people in this category were a major 7 part of the expected normal distribution of BMI in the general population. 8 9 Advantages of BMI 10 11 A significant advantage of BMI is the availability of extensive national reference data and its 12 established relationships with levels of body fatness, morbidity, and mortality in adults.26 BMI is 13 particularly useful in monitoring the treatment of obesity, with a weight change of about 3.5 kg 14 needed to produce a unit ch ange in BMI. In adults, BMI levels above 25 are associated with an 15 increased risk of morbidity and mortality, with BMI levels of 30 and greater indicating obesity.25 In 16 children, BMI is not a straightforward index because of growth. However, high BMI perce ntile 17 levels based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) BMI growth charts and changes 18 in parameters of BMI curves in children are linked to significant levels of risk for adult obesity at 19 corresponding high percentile levels.26 Further, BMI is readily available, inexpensive, can be 20 administered easily, and is understood easily by patients.27 BMI can also be used as an initial 21 screening tool to identify those at an elevated health risk because of excess body weight and poor 22 distribution of fat mass. 23 24 Disadvantages of BMI 25 26 BMI as a determinant of body fat mass . BMI does not differentiate between body lean mass and 27 body fat mass; a person can have a high BMI but still have a very low-fat mass and vice versa.28,29 28 From an anatomical and metabolic perspective, it has been proposed that the term obesity should 29 refer to an excessive accumulation of body fat (triacylglycerols) . The accuracy of the BMI as a 30 determinant of body fat mass has been repeatedly questioned because it has limitations in this 31 regard.30,31 Gender, age, ethnic ity, and leg length are important variables not considered by 32 BMI .32,33 It should also be noted that in population- based studies women generally have a BMI that 33 is lower than that in men, even though their fat mass relative to their body build or BMI is 34 considerably greater . 35 36 The relatively poor correlation between percent of body fat mass and BMI has been shown more 37 recently in the NHANES III database in which bioelectrical impedance was used to estimate the fat 38 component of body composition.39 In subjects with a BMI of 25 kg/m2, the percent of body fat in 39 men varied between 14 percent and 35 percent , and in women it varied between 26 percent and 43 40 percent. Th erefore, using the NIH criteria based on percent of body fat to define obesity, subjects 41 with a BMI of 25, a group that would be considered \" normal ,\" were associated with a body fat 42 mass that varied between \"low normal \" to \"obese. \" 43 44 In addition, a recent study in individuals with or without diabetes in which the loss of lean body 45 mass with aging was reported, the mean BMI in those without diabetes was 26.8. In those with 46 diabetes, the BMI was 29.1 . However, the percent of lean body mass was the same and therefore 47 the increased BMI in those with diabetes was not due only to an excessive accumulation of fat.34 48 Overall, although the correlation between the BMI and body fatness is strong, two people might 49 have the same BMI, but the level of body fatness may differ.35 Some examples of this include: 50 Women tend to have more body fat than men, 51 CSAPH Rep. 07- A-23 -- page 6 of 18 The amount of body fat may be higher or lower depending on the racial/ethnic group,36 1 Older people, on ave rage, tend to have more body fat than younger adults, and 2 Athletes have less body fat than do non- athletes. 3 4 BMI does not account for body fat location. BMI does not capture body fat location information , 5 which is an important variable in assessing the met abolic as well as mortality consequences of 6 excessive fat accumulation. This was first recognized in France by Dr Jon Vague in the 1940- 7 1950s.37 He noted that accumulation of fat in the upper part of the body versus the lower part of the 8 body was associate d with an increased risk for coronary heart disease, diabetes, and also gallstones 9 and gout. M en tend to accumulate fat in the abdominal (upper body) area, whereas women tend to 10 accumulate it in the peripelvic (gluteal) area and the thighs. A substitute for this information has 11 been to determine the abdominal circumference or an abdominal/hip circumference ratio. 12 Subsequent data indicate that the risk for development of diabetes as well as coronary heart 13 disease, is more strongly related to the accumulation of upper body fat than lower body fat in both 14 sexes.38 15 16 More specifically, both visceral fat accumulation and an expanded girth have been associated with 17 development of insulin resistance, diabetes, and risk for coronary heart disease and hypertension.39 18 Accumulation of fat in the abdominal area appears to correlate best with triacylglycerols 19 accumulating in the liver and skeletal muscle. Further, the relatively small accumulation of fat in 20 these organs would not be detectible by BMI determinations, and they do not correlate with total 21 body fat mass.40 22 23 BMI does not account for the life cycle and location of accumulated fat caused by hormones . Girls 24 tend to accumulate relatively large amounts of fat during and after puberty, particularly in the 25 peripelvic a nd thigh region; boys do not. During and after puberty, boys accumulate a relatively 26 large amount of lean mass (bone and muscle) but not fat mass. In both sexes, these changes are 27 reflected in an increased BMI. With aging, both sexes tend to develop fat in the upper part of the 28 body.41 The reason for these changes in amount and distribution is not completely understood. 29 Generally, it is considered to be caused by hormonal changes. Further, a study noted BMI cutoffs 30 fail to capture most postmenopausal women whose actual body fat percentage would classify them 31 as obese.42 As women age, they tend to lose bone and muscle mass, which are heavier than fat. So 32 even if a 65- year-old woman weighs the same as she did at 25 years of age, fat accounts for a larger 33 share of her weight . The study suggested that to improve the sensitivity of BMI in identifying 34 postmenopausal women at risk of obesity- related diseases, the obesity cutoff might need to be set 35 to 24.9, which is currently the top of the normal BMI range for the general adult population.42 36 37 BMI as a predictor of morbidity and m ortality . The BMI classification system currently is being 38 widely used in population- based studies to assess the risk for mortality in the different categories of 39 BMI. Even when some comorbidities are considered, the correlation of mortality rates with BMI 40 often does not take into consideration such factors as family history of diabetes, hypertension, 41 coronary heart disease, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemias, familial longevity or the family 42 prevalence of carcinomas, and other genetic factors . For example, it has been reported that more 43 than 50 percent of susceptibility to coronary artery disease is accounted for by genetic variants.43 44 45 Frequently, when correlations are made, they also do not take into consideration a past as well as a 46 current history of smoking, excessive alcohol use , serious and persistent mental illness or the 47 duration of obesity, when in the life cycle it appeared, and whether the body weight is relatively 48 stable or rapidly progressive. In most population- based studies, only the initial weight and/or BMI 49 are given, even though weight as well as fat stor es are known to increase and height to decrease 50 with aging. In addition, the rate of weight gain varies among individuals, as does the loss of muscle 51 CSAPH Rep. 07- A-23 -- page 7 of 18 mass.44 Muscle mass has been correlated negatively with insulin resistance and prediabetes.45 1 Lastly, population -based studies do not take into consideration the present and past history of a 2 person's occupation, medication- induced obesity, and how comorbidities are being treated. 3 4 BMI does not appropriately represent racial and ethnic minorities. The rise in obesity prevalence 5 rates has disproportionately affected U .S. minority populations. For example, one longitudinal 6 study of healthy women found that at the same BMI, Asians had more than double the risk of 7 developing type 2 diabetes than whites; Hispanics and blacks also had higher risks of diabetes than 8 whites, but to a lesser degree.46 Increases in weight over time were more harmful in Asians than in 9 the other ethnic groups: For every 11 pounds Asians gained during adulthood, they had an 84 10 percent increa se in their risk of type 2 diabetes; Hispanics, blacks, and whites who gained weight 11 also had higher diabetes risks, but again, to a much lesser degree than Asians.46 Several other 12 studies have found that at the same BMI, Asians have higher risks of hypert ension and 13 cardiovascular disease than their white European counterparts, and a higher risk of dying early 14 from cardiovascular disease or any cause.47,48 15 16 Researchers are still assessing why Asians have higher weight -related disease risks at lower BMIs. 17 One possible explanation is body fat. When compared to white Europeans of the same BMI, Asians 18 have 3 to 5 percent higher total body fat.49 South Asians, in particular, have especially high levels 19 of body fat and are more prone to developing abdominal obesit y, which may account for their very 20 high risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.50 In contrast, some studies have found that 21 blacks have lower body fat and higher lean muscle mass than whites at the same BMI, and 22 therefore, at the same BMI, may be at lower risk of obesity- related diseases.51 While genetic 23 differences may be at the root of these different body fat patterns in Asians and other ethnic groups, 24 environmental factors seem to be a much stronger force. For example, research suggests tha t under - 25 nutrition during fetal life, such as during the Chinese famine of 1954 to 1964, raises the risk of 26 diabetes in adulthood, especially when individuals live in nutritionally rich environments later in 27 life.52 28 29 BMI AND EATING DISORDERS 30 31 Eating disorders are behavioral conditions characterized by severe and persistent disturbance in 32 eating behaviors and associated distressing thoughts and emotion. Types of eating disorders include 33 anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, a voidant restrictive food intake disorder, 34 other specified feeding and eating disorders , pica and rumination disorder. E ating disorders affect 35 up to 5 percent of the population, and most often develop in adolescence and young adulthood.53 36 Evidence suggests that genes and heritability also play a part in why some people are at higher risk 37 for an eating disorder .53 38 39 Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by self -starvation and weight loss resulting in 40 low weight for height and age.53 BMI is used to diagnose an individual with anorexia nervosa and 41 is determined by an individual having a BMI of 18.5 or less .53 Although BMI is used to diagnose 42 anorexia nervosa, BMI does not accurately capture i ndividuals with bulimia nervosa. Individuals 43 with bulimia nervosa can be slightly underweight, normal weight, overweight or even obese.53 44 Further, BMI is inaccurate in capturing individuals with other s pecified feeding and eating 45 disorders. These include eating disorders or disturbances of eating behavior that cause distress and 46 impair family, social or work function but do not fit the other categories. In some cases, this is 47 because the frequency of the behavior does not meet the diagnostic threshold ( i.e., the frequency of 48 binges in bulimia or binge eating dis order) or the weight criteria for the diagnosis of anorexia 49 nervosa are not met.53 An example of another specified feeding and eating disorder is \"atypical 50 anorexia nervosa\". This category includes individuals who may have lost a lot of weight and whose 51 CSAPH Rep. 07- A-23 -- page 8 of 18 behaviors and preoccupation with weight or shape concerns and fear of fatness is consistent with 1 anorexia nervosa, but who are not yet considered underweight based on their BMI because their 2 baseline weight was above average.53 Therefore, utilizing BMI can lead to substandard treatment, 3 typically due to the use of BMI by insurance companies to cover inpatient treatment.54 Further, as 4 mentioned above, BMI is an inaccurate measure of obesity especially in children and adolescents 5 and can therefore hinder access to eating disorder treatments.41 6 7 OTHER DIAGNOSTIC MEASURES FOR DIAGNOSING OBESITY 8 9 Abdominal Circum ference 10 11 Obesity is commonly associated with increased amounts of intra- abdominal fat. A centralized fat 12 pattern is associated with the deposition of both intra- abdominal and subcutaneous abdominal 13 adipose tissue.55 It should be noted that abdominal circumference is an imperfect indicator of intra - 14 abdominal adipose tissue, as it also includes subcutaneous fat deposition, as well as visceral 15 adipose tissue. This does not preclude its usefulness, as it is associated wi th specific health risks.56 16 Persons in the upper percentiles for abdominal circumference are considered to have obes ity and at 17 increased risk for morbidity, specifically type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome, and 18 mortality.57 The ratio of abdominal c ircumference (often referred to incorrectly as \"waist\" 19 circumference) to hip circumference is a rudimentary index for describing adipose tissue 20 distribution or fat patterning.58 Abdomen- to-hip ratios greater than 0.85 represent a centralized 21 distribution of fat. Most men with a ratio greater than 1.0 and women with a ratio greater than 0.85 22 are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancers.59 23 24 Skinfold Measurement 25 26 Skinfold measurements are used to characterize subcutaneous fat thickness at various regions of the 27 body, but it should be noted that they have limited utility in people who are considered overweight 28 or have obes ity. The primary limitation is that most ski nfold calipers have an upper measurement 29 limit of 45 to 55 mm, which restricts their use to subjects who are moderately overweight or 30 thinner.2 A few skinfold calipers take large measurements, but this is not a significant improvement 31 because of the difficulty of grasping and holding a large skinfold while reading the caliper dial. The 32 majority of national reference data available are for skinfolds at the triceps and subscapular 33 locations. The triceps skinfold varies considerably by sex and can reflect changes in the underlying 34 triceps muscle rather than an actual change in body fatness. The statistical relationships between 35 skinfolds and percent or total body fat in children and adults are often not as strong as that of 36 BMI.60 Further , the upper distribution of subcutaneous fat measurements remains unknown because 37 most children and adults who have obesity have not had their skinfolds measured. 38 39 Waist- to-hip Ratio 40 41 The waist -to-hip ratio is often considered a better measurement than waist circumference alone in 42 predicting disease risk. To calculate the waist -to-hip ratio, a measuring tape is used to measure 43 waist circumference and hip circumference at its widest part. Observational studies have 44 demonstrated that people with \"apple -shaped\" bodies, (who carry more weight around the waist) 45 have greater risks for chronic disease than those with \"pear -shaped\" bodies, (who carry more 46 weight around the hips). A study with more than twenty- seven thousand participants from fifty- two 47 countries concluded that the waist -to-hip ratio is highly correlated with heart attack risk worldwide 48 and is a better predictor of heart attacks than BMI.61 Abdominal obesity is defined by the World 49 Health Organization (WHO) as having a waist -to-hip ratio above 0.90 for males and above 0.85 f or 50 females. 51 CSAPH Rep. 07- A-23 -- page 9 of 18 Visceral Index (VAI) 1 2 The Visceral Adiposity Index (VAI) is an empirical -mathematical model, gender -specific, based on 3 simple anthropometric (BMI and WC) and functional parameters (triglycerides (TG) and HDL 4 cholesterol (HDL)), and in dicative of fat distribution and function.62 It is an empirical- 5 mathematical model that does not originate from theoretical assumptions, but from observation in a 6 healthy normal/overweight population of a linear relationship between BMI and CV, from which a 7 linear equation has been extrapolated . The main strength to consider is that the VAI is an indicator 8 of early cardiometabolic risk in all borderline conditions in which overt metabolic syndrome is not 9 present. This is explained by the fact that three of the variables making up the VAI (WC, TG, and 10 HDL) are all expressed in the criteria for metabolic syndrome. An important limitation to consider 11 is the application of the VAI in non- Caucasian populations and in patients aged less than 16 12 years.58 This is because the mathematical modelling process was done on healthy Caucasian men 13 and women, aged between 19 and 83 years.58 A study which evaluated the VAI in childre n, found 14 that the VAI should be extrapolated with caution in this age range.63 Therefore, VAI is a useful 15 measurement in the following popul ations: healthy or apparently healthy population with BMI < 16 40kg/m2, patients with one or two of the 5 components of the metabolic syndrome, women with 17 PCOS, and patients with endocrine disorders ( i.e., acromegaly, adult GH deficiency, 18 hypogonadism, hyper prolactinemia, or abnormal thyroid function).58 19 20 Relative Fat Mass (RFM) 21 22 Relative fat mass (RFM) is a simple linear equation based on height -to-waist ratio, and has promise 23 as a potential alternative tool to estimate whole -body fat percentage in women and men 20 24 years of age and older. One study performed using nationally representative samples of the US 25 adult population which allowed evaluation of the performance of RFM among Mexican Americans, 26 European Americans, and African Americans.64 The performance of RFM to estimate body fat 27 percentage was overall more consistent than that of BMI among women and men, across ethnic 28 groups, young, middle -age and older adults, and across quintiles of body fat percentage, although 29 the accuracy of RFM was low er among individuals with lower body fatness.60 30 31 Hydrostatic weighing (densitometry) 32 33 Hydrostatic weighing (underwater weighing), or densitometry, is the difference of the body weight 34 in air and water is used to compute the body's density.65 Assuming a two- component model with 35 different densities for fat mass and fat -free mass and correcting for the air volume in the lungs, the 36 total body fat percentage can be estimated . This technique, however, cannot give any 37 measurements of the distributio n of adipose tissue or lean tissue (LT). 38 39 Air displacement plethysmography (ADP) 40 41 ADP , also known under its commercial brand name as BOD POD, measures the overall body 42 density, total body fat and lean tissue but not their distributions.66 By putting the body in an 43 enclosed chamber and changing the chamber's volume, the volume of the displaced air (i .e., the 44 volume of the body) can be determined from the changes in air pressure.60 Since ADP is based on 45 the same two -component model as hydros tatic weighing, it is also affected by the same 46 confounders, mainly variations in bone mineral content and hydration. Therefore, ADP, as well as 47 hydrostatic weighing, is limited to gross body composition analysis, and not estimates of regional 48 fat or muscl es. 49 50 Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) 51 CSAPH Rep. 07- A-23 -- page 10 of 18 1 BIA uses the electrical properties of the body to estimate the total body weight and from that the 2 body fat mass.67 The body is modeled as five cylindrical lean tissue compartments; the trunk and 3 the four limbs, while fat is considered to be an insulator. The impedance is assumed to be 4 proportional to the height and inversely proportional to the cross -sectional area of each 5 compartment. BIA requires different model parameters to be used depending on age, gender, level 6 of physical activity, amount of body fat , and ethnicity in order to be reliable.68 7 8 Dual -energy X -ray absorptiometry (DXA) 9 10 DXA is a two -dimensional imaging technique that uses X-rays with two different energies. By 11 using two different energy levels, the images can be separated into two components ( i.e., bone and 12 soft tissue). DXA is mainly used for bone mineral density measurements, where it is considered as 13 the gold standard, but it can also be used to estimate total and regional body fat and lean tissue 14 mass.69 DXA has been found to be more accurate than density- based methods for estimating total 15 body fat.70 Due to its ability to estimate regional fat and measure lean tissue, in combination with 16 relatively high availability, DXA has been use d for body composition analysis in a wide range of 17 clinical applications and is considered the gold standard for measuring body fat .71 18 19 Computed T omography (CT) Scan 20 21 CT gives a three -dimensional high- resolution image volume of the complete or selected par ts of the 22 body, computed from a large number of X -ray projections of the body from different angles. As 23 opposed to the previously described techniques, CT can accurately determine fat in skeletal muscle 24 tissue and in the liver.72 In practice, however, CT -based body composition analysis is in most cases 25 limited to two -dimensional analysis of one or a limited number of axial slices of the body. This 26 approach, however, limits its precision since the exact locations of slices, in relation to intern al 27 organs, cannot be determined and will vary between scans. Regardless, CT, together with MRI, is 28 today considered the gold standard for body composition analysis , which assessed t he proportion of 29 fat to fat -free mass in your body. 30 31 Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) 32 33 MRI uses the different magnetic properties of the nuclei of certain chemical elements (normally 34 hydrogen in water and fat) in the cells to produce images of soft tissue in the body. Several MRI - 35 based methods for quantification of adipose tissue and muscles have been developed and 36 implemented .73 MRI is used to obtain p recise measurements of regional adipose tissue and lean 37 tissue , as well as diffuse fat infiltration in other organs. However, d ue to several undeterminable 38 factors affecting the MR signal, an MR image is not calibrated on an absolute scale and therefore 39 cannot be quantitative . But by using different postprocessing techniques, the image can be 40 calibrated to quantitatively measure fat or adipose tissue .69 41 42 CALCULATING OBESITY IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS 43 44 In the United States, obesity and severe obesity in children and adolescents are defined using 45 threshold values from the 2000 CDC sex-specific body mass index- for-age growth charts.74 In 46 addition to defining obesity, BMI z -scores and percentiles are used to monitor children's weight 47 status over time and to evaluate obesity treatments in research settings. Percentiles near the upper 48 limit of 100 percent become less useful for detecting meaningful differences, and therefore 49 percentiles can be converted to z -scores that indicate the number of standard deviations of a value 50 from the mean. However, BMI z -scores (BMIz) and percentiles based -for-age 51 CSAPH Rep. 07- A-23 -- page 11 of 18 CDC growth charts (BMIz and BMI percenti les) were never meant to be used to monitor children 1 with extremely high BMI values, and significant limitations exist when they are used to monitor 2 children with severe obesity.75 Specifically , BMIz values corresponding to extremely high BMI 3 values are compressed into a very narrow range. Studies on obesity prevalence, its impact, and the 4 availability of effective treatment have highlighted the need for meaningful standardized measures 5 to track extre mely high values of BMI in clinical and research settings. 6 7 As a result of needing more standardized measures the CDC studied alternative BMI metrics which 8 include: 9 BMI 12 Percent of 95th percentile BMI units or percent from median , and 13 Adjusted BMI units or percent from median.76 14 15 None of these metrics had the problem of compression at extremely high BMI values, but all ha d 16 limitations, especially when applied a cross the weight status spectrum and a wide range of ages. 17 The report however concluded that t he extended method for calculating z -scores and percentiles 18 stands out among the alternatives.72 First, the extended method improves the characterization of 19 BMI d istributions at very high values using nationally representative data, but all other BMI 20 metrics that refer to a reference population (all alternative metrics except untransformed BMI) rely 21 on extrapolating beyond this reference population.72 Second, below the 95th percentile, extended 22 BMI z -scores and percentiles preserve CDC 2000 z -scores and percentiles that are currently in use, 23 which allows seamless transitions from the current CDC z -scores and percentiles below the 95 th 24 percentile to extended z -scores and percentiles above the 95th percentile.72 Alternative BMI metrics 25 other than extended BMIz and percentiles may be appropriate for use in certain scenarios, such as 26 during adolescence when differences among the metrics are less pronounced, when transitions to or 27 from obesity are minimal, or for monitoring BMI changes over short periods when adjusting for 28 expected growth and development is less critical. 29 30 INDICATIONS FOR METABOLIC AND BARIATRIC SURGERY 31 32 During the HOD Interim meeting in 2022, Resolution 937 \"Indications for Metabolic and Bariatric 33 Surgery,\" was in troduced by the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery, Society of 34 American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons . This resolu tion called for adoption of the 35 new American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery and International Federation for the 36 Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Disorders indications for metabolic and bariatric surgery . Given 37 that these guidelines depend on BMI, the y were referred for consideration in this report . 38 39 The American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) and the International 40 Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Disorders (IFSO) have convened to produce a 41 joint statemen t on the current available scientific information on metabolic and bariatric surgery 42 and its indications recommending the following updates: 43 Metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) is recommended for individuals with a body mass 44 index (BMI) 35 kg/m2, rega rdless of presence, absence, or severity of co -morbidities. 45 MBS should be considered for individuals with metabolic disease and BMI of 30 -34.9 46 kg/m2. 47 BMI thresholds should be adjusted in the Asian population such that a BMI 25 48 kg/m2suggests clinical obesity, and individuals with BMI 27.5 kg/m2should be offered 49 MBS. 50 CSAPH Rep. 07- A-23 -- page 12 of 18 Long- term results of MBS consistently demonstrate safety and efficacy. 1 Appropriately selected children and adolescents should be considered for MBS.77 2 3 It should be noted that the AMA did not participate in the development of these guidelines and 4 therefore cannot endorse these guidelines.AMA policies are also adopted for a period of 10 years 5 with the option of renewal through the Sunset process, therefor e it is important to not reference 6 specific guidelines in policy which may change over time. 7 8 EXISTING AMA POLICY 9 10 Under e xisting AMA P olicy H-440.866, \"The Clinical Utility of Measuring Body Mass Index and 11 Waist Circumference in the Diagnosis and Management of Adult Overweight and Obesity\" the 12 AMA supports: (1) greater emphasis in physician educational programs on the risk differences 13 among ethnic and age groups at varying levels of BMI and the importance of monitoring waist 14 circumference in individuals wi th BMIs below 35 kg/m2; (2) additional research on the efficacy of 15 screening for overweight and obesity, using different indicators, in improving various clinical 16 outcomes across populations, including morbidity, mortality, mental health, and prevention of 17 further weight gain; and (3) more research on the efficacy of screening and interventions by 18 physicians to promote healthy lifestyle behaviors, including healthy diets and regular physical 19 activity, in all of their patients to improve health and minimize disease risks. 20 21 Policy H -150.928, \" Eating Disorders and Promotion of Healthy Body Image ,\" supports increased 22 funding for research on the epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment 23 of eating disorders, including research on the effectivene ss of school -based primary prevention 24 programs for pre -adolescent children and their parents, in order to prevent the onset 25 of eating disorders and other behaviors associated with a negative body image. 26 27 Policy H -150.965, \" Eating Disorders \" notes that the AMA (1) adopts the position that 28 overemphasis of bodily thinness is as deleterious to one's physical and mental health as is obesity; 29 (2) asks its members to help their patients avoid obsessions with dieting and to develop balanced, 30 indivi dualized approaches to finding the body weight that is best for each of them; (3) encourages 31 training of all school- based physicians, counselors, coaches, trainers, teachers and nurses to 32 recognize unhealthy eating, dieting, and weight restrictive behavior s in adolescents and to offer 33 education and appropriate referral of adolescents and their families for interventional counseling; 34 and (4) participates in this effort by consulting with appropriate specialty societies and by assisting 35 in the dissemination o f appropriate educational and counseling materials pertaining to unhealthy 36 eating, dieting, and weight restrictive behaviors. 37 38 CONCLUSIONS 39 40 The most basic definition of obesity is having too much body fat , so much so that it presents a risk 41 to health.78 A reliable way to determine whether a person has too much body fat is to calculate the 42 ratio of their weight to their height squared. This ratio, called the body mass index (BMI), accounts 43 for the fact that taller people have more tissue than shorter people, and so they tend to weigh more. 44 BMI is not a perfect measure, because it does not directly assess body fat. Muscle and bone are 45 denser than fat, so an athlete or muscular person may have a high BMI, yet not have too much fat. 46 Risk of developing health pr oblems, including several chronic diseases such as heart disease and 47 diabetes, rises progressively for BMIs above 21. There's also evidence that at a given BMI, the risk 48 of disease is higher in some ethnic groups than others. 49 50 CSAPH Rep. 07- A-23 -- page 13 of 18 Critics of BMI note that b ody fat location is also important and could be a better indicator of 1 disease risk than the amount body fat.79 Fat that accumulates around the waist and chest (what is 2 called abdominal adiposity) may be more dangerous for long- term health than fat that accumulates 3 around the hips and thighs. Some researchers have further argued that BMI should be discarded in 4 favor of measures such as waist circumference.75 However, this is unlikely to happen given that 5 BMI is easier to measure and has a long history of use . In adults, measuring both BMI and waist 6 circumference may be a better way to predict someone's weight -related risk. In children, however , 7 there is no good reference data for waist circumference, so BMI -for-age is currently the gold 8 standard . Overall, BMI does not describe body fat distribution, so additional anthropometric 9 parameters should be used to assess enhanced accumulation of visceral adipose tissue. 10 11 Further, t he current BMI classification system is misleading regarding the effects of body fat ma ss 12 on mortality rates. The role of fat distribution in the prediction of medically significant morbidities 13 as well as for mortality risk is not captured by use of the BMI. Also, numerous comorbidities, 14 lifestyle issues, gender, ethnicities, medically signi ficant familial- determined mortality effectors, 15 duration of time one spends in certain BMI categories, and the expected accumulation of fat with 16 aging are likely to significantly affect interpretation of BMI data, particularly in regard to 17 morbidity and mo rtality rates. Such confounders as well as the known clustering of obesity in 18 families, the strong role of genetic factors in the development of obesity, the location in which 19 excessive fat accumulates, its role in the development of type 2 diabetes and hy pertension, and so 20 on, need to be considered before promulgation of public health policies that are designed to apply 21 to the general population and are based on BMI data alone. Further, the use of BMI is problematic 22 when used to diagnose and treat individuals with eating disorder s, because it does not capture the 23 full range of abnormal eating disorders. It should also be noted that the recent increase in fat 24 transfer procedures may complicate BMI measurement s and should be further studied. 25 26 RECOM MENDATIONS 27 28 The Council on Science and Public Health recommends that the following be adopted, and the 29 remainder of the report be filed. 30 31 1. Our AMA recognize s: 32 1. the issues with using body mass index (BMI) as a measurement because: (a) of the 33 eugenics behi nd the history of BMI , (b) of the use of BMI for racist exclusion, and 34 (c) BMI cutoffs are based on the imagined ideal Caucasian and do es not consider a 35 person's gender or ethnicity . 36 2. the significant limitations associated with the widespread use of BMI in clinical 37 settings and suggests its use be in a conjunction with other valid measures of risk 38 such as , but not limited to, measurements of : (a) visceral fat, (b) body adiposity 39 index, (c) body composition, (d) relative fat mass, (e) waist circumferen ce and (f) 40 genetic/metabolic factors. 41 3. that BMI is significantly correlated with the amount of fat mass in the general 42 population but loses predictability when applied on the individual level . 43 4. that relative body shape and composition heterogeneity across r ace/ethnic groups , 44 sexes, and age-span is essential to consider when applying BMI as a measure of 45 adiposity. 46 5. that in some diagnostic circumstances, the use of BMI should not be used as a sole 47 criterion for appropriate insurance reimbursement.

REPORT OF THE COUNCIL ON SCIENCE AND PUBLIC HEALTH CSAPH Report 08- A-23 Subject: Council on Science and Public Health Sunset Review of 2013 House Policies Presented by: Noel Deep, MD, Chair Referred to: Reference Committee D Policy G -600.110, \"Sunset Mechanism for AMA Policy,\" calls for the decennial review of 1 American Medical Association (AMA) policies to ensure that our AMA's policy database is 2 current, coherent, and relevant. This policy reads as follows, laying out the parameters for review 3 and specifying the needed procedures: 4 5 1. As the House of Delegates adopts policies, a maximum ten -year time horizon shall exist. A 6 policy will typically sunset after ten years unless action is taken by the House of Delegates to retain 7 it. Any action of our AMA House that reaffirms or amends an existing policy position shall reset 8 the sunset \"clock,\" making the reaffirmed or amended policy viable for another 10 years. 9 10 2. In the implementation and ongoing operation of our AMA policy sunset mecha nism, the 11 following procedures shall be followed: (a) Each year, the Speakers shall provide a list of policies 12 that are subject to review under the policy sunset mechanism; (b) Such policies shall be assigned to 13 the appropriate AMA councils for review; (c) Each AMA council that has been asked to review 14 policies shall develop and submit a report to the House of Delegates identifying policies that are 15 scheduled to sunset; (d) For each policy under review, the reviewing council can recommend one 16 of the followi ng actions: (i) retain the policy; (ii) sunset the policy; (iii) retain part of the policy; or 17 (iv) reconcile the policy with more recent and like policy; (e) For each recommendation that it 18 makes to retain a policy in any fashion, the reviewing council shall provide a succinct, but cogent 19 justification (f) The Speakers shall determine the best way for the House of Delegates to handle the 20 sunset reports. 21 22 3. Nothing in this policy shall prohibit a report to the HOD or resolution to sunset a policy earlier 23 than its 10- year horizon if it is no longer relevant, has been superseded by a more current policy, or 24 has been accomplished. 25 26 4. The AMA councils and the House of Delegates should conform to the following guidelines for 27 sunset: (a) when a policy is no long er relevant or necessary; (b) when a policy or directive has been 28 accomplished; or (c) when the policy or directive is part of an established AMA practice that is 29 transparent to the House and codified elsewhere such as the AMA Bylaws or the AMA House of 30 Delegates Reference Manual: Procedures, Policies and Practices. 31 32 5. The most recent policy shall be deemed to supersede contradictory past AMA policies. 33 34 6. Sunset policies will be retained in the AMA historical archives. 35 CSAPH Rep. 08- A-23 -- page 2 of 29 RECOMMENDATION 1 2 The Council on Sc ience and Public Health recommends that the House of Delegates policies listed 3 in the appendix to this report be acted upon in the manner indicated and the remainder of this report 4 be filed.

(2) The fetal risks involved in moderate or minimal alcohol consumption have not been established through research to date, nor has a safe level of maternal gestational alcohol use been established. One of the objectives of future research should be t o determine whether there is a level of maternal gestational alcohol consumption below which embryotoxic and teratogenic effects attributable to alcohol are virtually non -existent. (3) Until such a determination is made, physicians should inform their pati ents as to what the research to date does and does not show and should encourage them to decide about drinking in light of the evidence and their own situations. Physicians should be explicit in reinforcing the concept that, with several aspects of the iss ue still in doubt, the safest course is abstinence. (4) Long -term longitudinal studies should be undertaken to give a clearer perception of the nature and duration of alcohol -related birth defects. Cooperative projects should be designed with uniform means of assessing the quantity and extent of alcohol intake. (5) To enhance public education efforts, schools, hospitals, and community organizations should become involved in programs conducted by governmental agencies and professional associatio ns. (6) Physicians should take an active part in education campaigns. In so doing, they should emphasize the often overlooked consequences of maternal gestational drinking that are less dramatic and pronounced than are features of the fetal alcohol syndrom e, consequences that are at least indicated, if not sharply delineated, by some of the research that has been conducted in several parts of the world with diverse populations.

CSAPH Rep. 08-A-23 -- page 19 of 29 H-455.994 Risks of Nuclear Energy and Low - Level Ionizing Radiation Our AMA supports the following policy on nuclear energy and low -level ionizing radiation: (1) Usefulness of Nuclear Energy: Energy produced by nuclear reactors makes an important contribution to the generation of electricity in the US at present, and it will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. Investigation and research should continue in order to develop improved safety and efficiency of nuclear reactors, and to explore the potential of competing methods for generating electricity. The research sh ould include attention to occupational and public health hazards as well as to the environmental problems of waste disposal and atmospheric pollution. (2) Research on Health Effects of Low Level Radiation: There should be a continuing emphasis on research that is capable of determining more precisely the health effects of low level ionizing radiation. (3) Uranium Mill Tailings: Uranium mill tailings should be buried or otherwise covered. (4) Radioactive Waste Disposal: There should be acceleration of pilot projects to evaluate techniques for the disposal of high- level radioactive wastes. The decommissioning of nuclear reactors is a source of nuclear waste which requires accelerated technological investigation and planning. Local laws should be modified to allow the disposal of low level radioactive waste materials in accordance with AMA model state legislation . (5) Occupational Safety: The philosophy of maintaining exposures of workers at levels \"as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA)\" is commended. The pres ent federal standards for occupational exposure to ionizing radiation are adequate. The responsibilities of the various federal agencies regarding workers in the nuclear energy industry should be clarified; these agencies include the Departments of Energy, Defense, HHS, Labor and Transportation; and the NRC, VA and EPA. (6) Minimizing Exposures to Radiation: Each physician should attempt to minimize exposures of patients to ionizing radiation in accord with good medical practice. (7) Radiation Exposure Standards: The present standards for exposure of populations to ionizing radiation are adequate for the protection of the public. (8) Emergencies and Governmental Readiness: Government agencies at all levels should be prepared to respond to nuclear energy- related emergencies. There is need for improved public planning by the several federal agencies involved, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the agencies of state and local governments. Responsible officials should develop skills and undergo periodic retraining in order to be able to act appropriately during major radiation emergencies.

CSAPH Rep. 08-A-23 -- page 20 of 29 governments and the federal government (FEMA) would benefit from the cooperation of physicians and others in the health sciences. (9) Federal Radiation Emergency Planning Responsibilities: Federal groups such as the NRC and FEMA must work together closely to fulfill responsi bilities in radiological emergency preparedness and in crisis management. There is a need for NRC and FEMA to define better the roles of community hospitals and of physicians. (10) Reactor Operators and Radiation Inspectors: There is a need for better trai ning of operating personnel with regard to prevention and management of untoward reactor operating conditions. Selection, training, and ongoing performance evaluation of operating personnel, and of radiation inspectors, are key elements in the safety of re actor workers and of the public. Physicians should help develop methods of selecting and evaluating personnel in the nuclear power industry. (11) Radiation Training for Physicians: Physicians should be prepared to answer the questions of their patients about ionizing radiation, especially if there is a radiation emergency. Each hospital should have adequately trained physicians and a plan and protocol for receiving and caring for radiation victims. (12) Radiation Education for the Public: Further education of the public about ionizing radiation is recommended. (13) Location of Nuclear Reactors: All nuclear reactors built in the future should be placed in areas of low population density; present reactors located in low density areas should be managed so that the populations surrounding them remain small. (14) Multiple Sources of Power Generation: AMA recommends the use of a diverse set of electricity generating methods and a continuing emphasis on the conservation of energy. (15) X -Ray Security Scanners: Our AMA: (1) believes that as of June 2013, no data exist to suggest that individuals, including those who are especially sensitive to ionizing radiation, should avoid backscatter security scanners due to associated health risks; and (2) supports the adoption of routine inspection, maintenance, calibration, survey, and officer training procedures meant to ensure that backscatter security scanners operate as intended.

Citation: Res. 518, A -17 Resident and Fellow Access to Fertility Preservation H -310.902 Our AMA: (1) encourages insurance coverage for fertility preservation and infertility treatment within health insurance benefits for residents and fellows offered through graduate medical education programs; and (2) supports the accommodation of residents and fellows who elect to pursue fertility preservation and infertility treatment, including but not limited to, the need to attend medical visits to complete the gamete preservation process and to administer medications in a time- sensitive fashion. Citation: Res. 302, A -22; E -4.2.1 Assisted Reproductive Technology Assisted reproduction offers hope to patients who want children but are unable to have a child without medical assistance. In many cases, patients who seek assistance have been repeatedly frustrated in their attempts to have a child and are psychologically very vulnerable. Patients whose health insurance does not cover assisted reproductive services may also be financially vulnerable. Candor and respect are thus essential for ethical practice. \"Assisted reproductive technology \" is understood as all treatments or procedures that include the handling of human oocytes or embryos. It encompasses an increasingly complex range of interventions \u2014 such as therapeutic donor insemination, ovarian stimulation, ova and sperm retrieval, in vitro f ertilization, gamete intrafallopian transfer \u2014and may involve multiple participants. Physicians should increase their awareness of infertility treatments and options for their patients. Physicians who offer assisted reproductive services should: (a) Value the well -being of the patient and potential offspring as paramount.

Citation: Issued: 2016 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 403 (A-23) Introduced by: Medical Student Section Subject: Denouncing the Use of Solitary Confinement in Correctional Facilities and Detention Centers Referred to: Reference Committee D Whereas, Correctional facilities, which include prisons and jails, are facilities that house people 1 who have been accused and/or convicted of a crime 1; and 2 3 Whereas, Detention centers refer to facilities that hold undocumented immigrants, refugees, 4 people awaiting trial or sentence, or young offenders for short periods of time2; and 5 6 Whereas , Solitary confinement is the physical and social isolation of an incarcerated individual 7 confined to a cell for 22 -24 hours per day, routinely used as a punishment for disciplinary 8 violations in correctional facilities and detention centers3; and 9 10 Whereas, Solitary confinement is used as punishment for minor nonviolent infractions, such as 11 not standing up for headcount or not returning a food tray3,4; and 12 13 Whereas, Recent whistleblower accounts describe the use of solitary confinement as a means 14 of repris al for reporting unsafe and unsanitary conditions5,6; and 15 16 Whereas, Solitary confinement is distinguished from medical isolation and quarantine because 17 solitary confinement is used punitively while medical isolation is used to reduce the spread of 18 infectio us disease7; and 19 20 Whereas, Solitary confinement consists of extended lengths of social separation, sensory 21 deprivation, and the revocation of prison privileges, while medical isolation is a temporary 22 measure overseen by medical professionals who treat prisoners with compassion and provide 23 prisoners resources to aid their recovery7; and 24 25 Whereas, In the United States, approximately 4.5% of incarcerated individuals, or around 26 60,000 people, currently reside in some form of solitary confinement8; and 27 28 Whereas , A year in solitary confinement costs three times as much per prisoner, or an average 29 of $75,000 per prisoner per year9; and 30 31 Whereas, Individuals in solitary confinement often suffer from sensory deprivation and are 32 offered few or no educational, vocational, or rehabilitative programs10; and 33 34 Whereas, Chronic social isolation stress, as perpetuated by solitary confinement, is associated 35 with a higher risk of cognitive deterioration, learning deficits, anxiety, depression, post -traumati c 36 stress disorder, and psychosomatic behavior changes11-13; and 37 Resolution: 403 (A-23) Page 2 of 6 Whereas, There is a strong association between solitary confinement and self -harm, for 1 instance, one JAMA study found persons that held in solitary confinement had a 78% higher 2 suicide rate within the first year after release and another study analyzing over 240,000 3 incarcerations found that prisoners who experienced solitary confinement accounted for over 4 50% of self -harm incidents despite accounting for only 7.3% of prison admissions4,13,14; and 5 6 Whereas, Individuals who spend time in solitary confinement are 127% more likely to die of an 7 opioid overdose in the first two weeks after release and 24% more likely to die from any cause 8 in the first year after release, even after controlling for potential confounding factors, including 9 substance use and mental health disorders14; and 10 11 Whereas, Formerly incarcerated individuals who spend time in solitary confinement have a 12 higher overall 5 -year mortality than those who do not15; and 13 14 Whereas, A United States Department of Justice study indicates that inmates wit h mental 15 illnesses are more likely to be put in solitary confinement and that solitary confinement further 16 exacerbates their mental illnesses16; and 17 18 Whereas, Solitary confinement increases the likeliness of episodes of psychosis and long- term 19 neurobiological consequences, increasing mentally ill prisoners' need for psychiatric 20 services12,13; and 21 22 Whereas, Prisoners who spend any amount of time in solitary confinement have higher rates of 23 homelessness and unemployment after release, in part due to the last ing psychological stress 24 of confinement17; and 25 26 Whereas, Spending any amount of time in solitary confinement is associated with two times the 27 risk of being reincarcerated within two weeks of release and other studies found a 10 -25% 28 increased overall risk o f recidivism14,18- 20; and 29 30 Whereas, Parolees released from solitary confinement commit new crimes in their community 31 35% more than parolees released from the general prison population, threatening community 32 safety19; and 33 34 Whereas , Transitioning prisoners from solitary confinement to the general prison population 35 prior to release reduces recidivism rates20; and 36 37 Whereas, A 2018 nationwide survey of correctional facilities found that, in most jurisdictions, 38 certain racial minorities are disproportionately more likely to be placed in solitary confinement 39 while white prisoners are 14% less likely to be placed in solitary confinement8; and 40 41 Whereas, A study of over 100,000 prisoners found that the odds that gay and bisexual men will 42 be placed in solitary confinement are 80% greater than heterosexual men and the odds are 43 190% greater that lesbian and bisexual women will be placed in solitary confinement than 44 heterosexual women21; and 45 46 Whereas, The United Nations and The International Convention on the Rights of the Child 47 prohibit the solitary confinement of anyone under the age of 1822,23; and 48 49 Whereas, In 2015 the United Nations General Assembly adopted \"The Standard Minimum 50 Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners,\" also known as the \"Mandela Rules,\" which condemn t he 51 Resolution: 403 (A-23) Page 3 of 6 use of solitary confinement for prisoners with mental or physical disabilities when their 1 conditions would be exacerbated by such measures23; and 2 3 Whereas, The same rules call for the prohibition of prolonged solitary confinement, longer than 4 15 days, because it is \"cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\"23; and 5 6 Whereas, The Mandela Rules further state that \"solitary confinement shall be used only in 7 exceptional cases as a last resort, for as short a time as possible and subject to i ndependent 8 review\"23; and 9 10 Whereas, Solitary confinement is a risk for self -harm and predisposes to a multitude of physical 11 and psychological health issues, and should be considered cruel and unusual punishment and a 12 human rights violation24; and 13 14 Whereas , At least some United States correctional facilities have managed to reform and 15 reduce their use of solitary confinement in order to better respect the dignity and human rights 16 of inmates while still maintaining the safety of correctional officers and inmates in jails and 17 prisons18; and 18 19 Whereas, In Colorado, state prisons have reduced their use of solitary confinement by 85% 20 without any other interventions and have seen a concurrent drop in the rate of prisoner on staff 21 violence18; and 22 23 Whereas, In Missis sippi, when correctional facilities reduced their solitary confinement 24 population, violent incidents also dropped by nearly 70%19; and 25 26 Whereas, A 2015 study found that placing male inmates who were violent in solitary 27 confinement did not effectively deter or alter the probability, timing, or development of future 28 misconduct or violence25; and 29 30 Whereas, Some correctional facilities have created special units to protect vulnerable groups 31 together with similar access to privileges and programs available to the general population 32 without using solitary confinement as a means of protection18; and 33 34 Whereas, Alternatives to solitary confinement exist for individuals with mental illness and for 35 sexual minorities, such as the Clinical Alternative to Punitive Segregation (CAPS) unit in New 36 York City26; and 37 38 Whereas, American Medical Association policy H- 60.922 opposes the use of solitary 39 confinement of juveniles for disciplinary purposes in correctional facilities; therefore be it 40 41 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association policy H- 430.983 be amended by addition 42 and deletion to read as follows: 43 44 Reducing Opposing the Use of Restrictive Housing in for 45 Prisoners with Mental Illness H-430.983 46 Our AMA will: (1) support limiting oppose the use of solitary 47 confinement of any length, with rare exceptions, for incarcerated 48 persons with mental illness , in adult correctional facilities and 49 detention centers, except for medical isolation or to protect 50 individuals who are actively being harmed or will be immediately 51 harmed by a physically violent individual, in which cases 52 Resolution: 403 (A-23) Page 4 of 6 confinement may be used for as short a time as possible; and (2) 1 while solitary confinement practices are still in place, support 2 efforts to ensure that the mental and physical health of all 3 individuals placed in solitary confinement are regularly monitored 4 by health professionals; and (3) encourage appropriate 5 stakeholders to develop and implement safe, humane, and ethical 6 alternatives to solitary confinement for incarcerated persons in all 7 correctional facilities.; and (3) encourage appropriate stakeholders 8 to develop and implement alternatives to solitary confinement for 9 incarcerated persons in all correctional facilities.

Citation: BOT Rep. 24, A -18; AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 404 (A-23) Introduced by: Medical Student Section Subject: Additional Interventions to Prevent Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection and HPV -Associated Cancers Referred to: Reference Committee D Whereas, Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection and 1 is known to cause cervical, vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal, and oropharyngeal cancer1; and 2 3 Whereas, Smoking, immunosuppression, a history of Chlamydia infection, long term oral 4 contraceptive use, and an increased number of sexual partners is associated with higher risk of 5 developing cervical cancer1,2; and 6 7 Whereas, No current screening test exists to detect HPV infection in people who have penises4; 8 and 9 10 Whereas, No current screening test exists to detect HPV infection in the oropharynx4; and 11 12 Whereas, From 1995- 2012, the proportion of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas driven 13 by HPV infection increased substantially in people with penises (36% to 72%) and people with 14 cervixes (29% to 77%)5; and 15 16 Whereas, The nine- valent HPV vaccination is efficacious against HPV strains known to cause 17 anogenital warts, cervical, vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal, and oropharyngeal cancers1,8; and 18 19 Whereas, HPV vaccination programs in the United States have been expanded beyond female- 20 only programs to prevent HPV infection in all people6; and 21 22 Whereas, HPV vaccination is now FDA approved up to 46 years of age for all people, and is 23 recommended routinely for individuals aged 11 -26 and may be recommended in 27- 45 year - 24 olds after discussion with their clinician9; and 25 26 Whereas, Carceral facilities have limited history of providing HPV vaccinations, while 27 incarcerated individuals have low self- reported vaccination rates compared to the non- 28 incarcerated population10,11; and 29 30 Whereas, Most incarcerated women between 18 -26 years of age have not received HPV 31 immunization but would be willing to if offered11; and 32 33 Whereas, People with criminal -legal histories are five times more likely to develop cervical 34 cancer in their lifetimes than the general population10; and 35 36 Whereas, The Federal Bureau of Prisons' Clinical Guidelines support routine cervical cancer 37 screening in carceral facilities as a means of cervical cancer prevention6; and 38 Resolution: 404 (A-23) Page 2 of 10 Whereas, Many carceral facilities under state and federal jurisdiction are not equipped to 1 provide basic gynecological medical care including gynecologic testing and procedures that 2 require specialized diagnostic equipment7; and 3 4 Whereas, Some carceral facility administrators and local health departments have 5 demonstrated an interest in providing HPV vaccination to people who are incarcerated12,13; and 6 7 Whereas, Successful HPV vaccination programs have been introduced through collaborations 8 between carceral facilities and health departments12,13; and 9 10 Whereas, Between 32% and 42% of formerly incarcerated individuals were medically insured 11 eight to ten months after release from their carceral facility14; and 12 13 Whereas, Uninsured and underinsured individuals are unlikely to have access to routine and 14 preventive medical care, including HPV immunization and cervical dysplasia treatment15; and 15 16 Whereas, A 2019 analysis from the US National Health Interview Survey guideline- concordant 17 cervical cancer screening showed disparities in cervical cancer screening by race, sexual 18 orientation, and rural residency16; and 19 20 Whereas, These disparities resulted in a lack of timely diagnosis and treatment for cervical pre- 21 cancers, leading to worse outcomes and disparities in mortality from cervical cancer17,18; and 22 23 Whereas, Black women had a 19% increase in mortality risk compared to white women despite 24 controlling for age, stage, histology, and treatment17; and 25 26 Whereas, Barriers to screening include personal and structural barriers such as distrust in the 27 healthcare system, transportation, cost, time off work, and lack of access to facilities equipped 28 for cervical cancer screening17,18; and 29 30 Whereas, Screening for HPV commonly consists of so -called \"primary screening\" for high risk 31 HPV (hrHPV) DNA in samples from a patient's cervix using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 32 and cytology wherein cervical samples are microscopically examined for presence of dysplasia 33 or neoplasia19; and 34 35 Whereas, Co -testing refers to screening with both primary screening and cytology19; and 36 37 Whereas, The use of a liquid- based, thin layer preparation technique for HPV cytology over 38 conventional preparation techniques allows for dual testing of HPV to gather further information 39 about cervical cancer risk20; and 40 41 Whereas, Self-sampling is a type of primary screening where patients collect a vaginal sample 42 using various collection methods including tampon, brush, swag, lavage, or vaginal patch either 43 at home or at a clinic and then send those samples out to a third party for analysis10; and 44 45 Whereas, Self -sampling for HPV screening is not currently approved by the US Food and Drug 46 Administration (FDA)21; and 47 48 Whereas, In a systematic review of over 40 studies in the literature, a recent meta -analysis 49 found that pooled estimated sensitivity measuring cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2+ of 50 primary HPV testing, conventional cytology testing alone, or liquid- based cytology alone was 51 Resolution: 404 (A-23) Page 3 of 10 89.9%, 62.5%, and 72.9%, respectively, while the pooled specificity of the tests were 89.9%, 1 96.6%, and 90.3%, respectively22; and 2 3 Whereas, The same study found that for detection of higher -grade CIN 3+, a comparison of 4 primary testing compared to conventional cytology found a relative sensitivity of 1.46 (95% CI: 5 1.12 to 1.91) and a relative specificity of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.93 to 0.97), while comparison of 6 primary hrHPV testing to liquid- based cytology in measuring CIN 3+ was found to have a 7 relativity sensitivity of 1.17 (95% CI, 1.07 to 1.28) and a relative specificity of 0.96 (95% CI: 0.95 8 to 0.97)22; and 9 10 Whereas, In a meta -analysis of 36 studies, HPV testing on self -samples had a pooled sensitivity 11 of 76% (85%, CI 69 -82) for CIN 2+ and 84% (95% CI, 72- 92) for CIN 3+, while the pooled 12 specificity was 86% (95%, 83- 89) and 87% (95%, 84- CIN 2+ and CIN 3+, 13 respectively23; and 14 15 Whereas, Self -testing was found to have lower sensitivity and specificity in a comparison of 16 clinician -taken samples, with a ratio of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.85-0.91) for CIN 2+ and a ratio 0.96 17 (95% CI, 0.95 -0.97) for CIN 2+23; and 18 19 Whereas, Studies have shown conflicting results regarding the sensitivity/specificity of self - 20 sampling compared to clinician- collected samples for HPV testing21,23,24; and 21 22 Whereas, Primary HPV testing has been shown in several analyses to cause an increase in 23 detection of HPV and a decrease in cost burden to the healthcare system, and may be more 24 cost- effective than co -testing25-30; and 25 26 Whereas, Emerging international evidence, particularly from the United Kingdom, suggests, that 27 self-sampling for HPV may be a cost -effective approach for cervical cancer screening31-33; and 28 29 Whereas, Compared to physician- administered testing, HPV self -sampling has been shown to 30 increase equity in cervical cancer screening by offering a greater reach to ethnic minority 31 women, sexual minority women, as well as women from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, 32 therefore helping to reduce disparities in cervical cancer screening34-37; and 33 34 Whereas, Traditional Medicaid includes mandatory family planning service benefits for 35 individuals of childbearing age, though it provides no formal definition for \"family planning,\" 36 leading to state -to-state variation in the services covered by this benefit38; and 37 38 Whereas, While all states provide Medicaid coverage or public assistance programs for cervical 39 cancer screening, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded Medicaid and in so doing creating a 40 new eligibility category which has federally -specified coverage requirements for family planning 41 (including screening services), but these new requirements do not apply t o states with a 42 traditional Medicaid program only who have not expanded Medicaid38; and 43 44 Whereas, For US citizens not eligible for Medicaid, the CDC also operates the National Breast 45 and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (AKA the Early Detection Program) to provide 46 cancer screening and diagnostic services to people who are low -income, uninsured, or 47 underinsured39; and 48 49 Whereas, Medicare covers all possible screening options currently recommended by the AAFP, 50 ACS, ACOG, and USPSTF with the exception of primary HPV testing40; and 51 Resolution: 404 (A-23) Page 4 of 10 Whereas, In their 2015 decision memo covering co- testing, the Center for Medicare and 1 Medicaid Services (CMS) acknowledged that ongoing studies were evaluating HPV for primary, 2 stand alone screening41; and 3 4 Whereas, AMA policy H -430.986 supports programs and staff training necessary to provide 5 gynecologic care for incarcerated women and adolescent females; and 6 7 Whereas, AMA policy H -440.872 supports HPV vaccination and cervical cancer prevention 8 worldwide and AMA Policy D -440.955 advocates for \"the development of vaccine assistance 9 programs to meet HPV vaccination needs of uninsured and underinsured populations\" ; 10 therefore be it 11 12 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association amend Policy H -440.872, HPV Vaccine 13 and Cervical Cancer Prevention Worldwide, by addition to read as follows: 14 15 HPV Vaccine and Cervical Cancer Prevention Worldwide H - 16 440.872 17 1. Our AMA (a) urges physicians to educate themselves and their 18 patients about HPV and associated diseases, HPV vaccination, as 19 well as routine HPV related cancer screening; and (b) encourages 20 the development and funding of programs targeted at HPV vaccine 21 introduction and HPV related cancer screening in countries without 22 organized HPV related cancer screening programs. 23 2. Our AMA will intensify efforts to improve awareness and 24 understanding about HPV and associated diseases in all individuals, 25 regardless of sex, such as, but not limited to, cervical cancer, head 26 and neck cancer, anal cancer, and genital cancer, the availabil ity 27 and efficacy of HPV vaccinations, and the need for routine HPV 28 related cancer screening in the general public. 29 3. Our AMA: 30 (a) encourages the integration of HPV vaccination and routine 31 cervical cancer screening into all appropriate health care setti ngs 32 and visits, 33 (b) supports the availability of the HPV vaccine and routine cervical 34 cancer screening to appropriate patient groups that benefit most 35 from preventive measures, including but not limited to low- income 36 and pre -sexually active populations, 37 (c) recommends HPV vaccination for all groups for whom the 38 federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices 39 recommends HPV vaccination. 40 4. Our AMA will encourage appropriate stakeholders to investigate 41 means to increase HPV vaccination rates by faci litating 42 administration of HPV vaccinations in community -based settings 43 including school settings. 44 5. Our AMA will study requiring HPV vaccination for school 45 attendance. 46 6. Our AMA encourages collaboration with stakeholders to provide 47 human papillomavirus vaccination to people who are incarcerated 48 for the prevention of HPV -associated cancers. (Modify Current 49 HOD Policy) ; and be it further 50 Resolution: 404 (A-23) Page 5 of 10 RESOLVED, That our AMA amend policy H -55.971, \"Screening and 1 Treatment for Breast and Cervical Cancer Risk Reduction\", by addition and 2 deletion to read as follows: 3 4 Screening and Treatment for Breast and Cervical Cancer Risk 5 Reduction H -55.971 6 1. Our AMA supports programs to screen all women individuals with 7 relevant anatomy for breast and cervical cancer and that 8 government funded programs be available for low income women 9 individuals ; the development of public information and educational 10 programs with the goal of informing all women individuals with 11 relevant anatomy about r outine cancer screening in order to reduce 12 their risk of dying from cancer; and increased funding for 13 comprehensive programs to screen low income women individuals 14 for breast and cervical cancer and to assure access to definitive 15 treatment. 16 2. Our AMA encourages state and local medical societies to monitor 17 local public health screening programs to ensure that they are linked 18 to treatment resources in the public or private sector. 19 3. Our AMA encourages efforts by the Centers for Medicare and 20 Medicaid Services to evaluate and review their current cervical 21 cancer screening policies in an effort to expand coverage for HPV 22 testing including but not limited to in- office primary HPV testing. 23 (Modify Current HOD Policy) ; and be it further 24 25 RESOLVED, That our AMA support further research by relevant stakeholders of HPV self - 26 sampling in the United States to determine whether it can decrease health care disparities in 27 cervical cancer screening.

Our AMA, in collaboration with state and national medical specialty societies and other relevant stakeholders, will advocate for the improvement of conditions of incarceration in all correctional and immigrant detention facilities to allow for the implementation of evidence- based COVID -19 infection prevention and control guidance. 2. Our AMA will advocate for adequate access to personal protective equipment and SARS -CoV-2 testing kits, sanitizing and disinfecting equipment for correctional and detention facilities. 3. Our AMA will advocate for humane and safe quarantine protocols for individuals who are incarcerated or detained that test positive for or are exposed to SARS -CoV-2, or other contagious respiratory pathogens. 4. Our AMA supports expa nded data reporting, to include testing rates and demographic breakdown for SARS- CoV-2 and other contagious infectious disease cases and deaths in correctional and detention facilities. 5. Our AMA recognizes that detention center and correctional workers, incarcerated persons, and detained immigrants are at high- risk for COVID -19 infection and therefore should be prioritized in Resolution: 404 (A-23) Page 10 of 10 receiving access to safe, effective COVID -19 vaccine in the initial phases of distribution, and that this policy will be shared wit h the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for consideration in making their final recommendations on COVID -19 vaccine allocation. 6.

(2018) showed that ERPO laws reduced suicide rates by 18 13.7% in Connecticut and 7.5% in Indiana; further Wintemute et al. (2019) evaluated 159 19 uses of California's ERPO law and found 21 cases in which an ERPO was initiated after an 20 individual with access to firearms threatened a mass shooting, none of the threatened 21 shootings took place5,6; and 22 23 Whereas, Only Hawaii, Maryland, Connecticut, New York and Washington, DC currently 24 include medical professionals as parties who can utilize ERPO laws, with Connecticut and 25 New York updating their ERPO laws to include this in June 2021 and June 2022 26 respectively1,7-10; and 27 28 Whereas, In ERPO laws, \"medical professionals\" generally refers to licensed physicians, 29 physician assistants, advanced practice registered nurses, psychologists, counselors, and 30 social workers who have examined the individual9,11; and 31 32 Whereas, In a Maryland study, surveyed physicians identified lack of knowledge about ERPO 33 laws as a barrier to physicians utilizing ERPO, and these same physicians asserted that this 34 barrier may be mitigated by increased training about ERPO laws12; and 35 36 Whereas, Since 2014, the ever -growing firearm epidemic has worsened, with the number of 37 mass shootings increasing from 273 per year in 2014 to 691 per year in 2021, the number of 38 Resolution: 405 (A-23) Page 2 of 9 deaths due to gun violence has increased from 12,418 people per year in 2014 to 19,411 1 people per year in 202013; and 2 3 Whereas, The shooter in Buffalo New York in May 2022 was released without treatment, law 4 enforcement follow- up, or enactment of an ERPO following an evaluation by mental health 5 professionals, and following the shooting, New York updated its law to now include medical 6 professionals as a party able to file an ERPO7,14- 16; and 7 8 Whereas, Many states have mandatory or permissive Duty to Protect or Duty to Warn laws 9 for mental health professionals to report threats of imminent physical harm to other 10 persons17,18; and 11 12 Whereas, Physicians, specifically those that treat persons at risk for suicide and intimate 13 partner violence, are highly trained to identify high- risk individuals based on symptoms, 14 behavioral patterns, and screening19-22; and 15 16 Whereas, Medical professionals are encouraged to ask about firearm access during routine 17 patient visits which can help allow them to identify at risk individuals who may have access to 18 firearms22; and 19 20 Whereas, HIPAA does not explicitly define firearm ownership as protected health information 21 (PHI), permitting disclosure in cases of public interest and benefit; and further in June 2021 22 the United States Department of Justice stated that disclosures of PHI are allowed in 23 compliance with ERPO laws when necessary to prevent imminent threats to the health and 24 safety of an individual and/or the public23,24; and 25 26 Whereas, AMA policy H -145.972, Firearms and High Risk Individuals, describes the function 27 and process of ERPO/Red Flag laws but does not currently include medical professionals as 28 a party who can petition the court; and 29 30 Whereas, AMA policy H -145.976 supports creating state- specific guidance for physicians 31 about how to assess and act on risk of gun violence with patients within the scope of current 32 state law, but does not call for legislative change in those states; and 33 34 Whereas, AMA policy H -145.975 encourages physicians to work with families to reduce 35 patient access to lethal means when there is suicide risk but does not call for the passage of 36 laws to allow for physicians to act to reduce patient access to lethal means directly; therefore 37 be it 38 39 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association work with relevant stakeholders to 40 develop state- specific training programs for medical professionals on how to use Extreme 41 Risk Protection Order/Red Flag Laws (Directive to Take Action); and be it further 42 43 RESOLVED, That our AMA work with relevant stakeholders to update medical curricula with 44 training surrounding how to approach conversations about Extreme Risk Protection 45 Order/Red Flag laws with patients and families (Directive to Take Action); and be it further 46 47 RESOLVED, That our AMA support amending policy \"Firearms and High -Risk Individuals H- 48 145.972\" by addition to read as follows : 49 Resolution: 405 (A-23) Page 3 of 9 1 Firearms and High- Risk Individuals H- 145.972 2 Our AMA supports: (1) the establishment of laws allowing family 3 members, intimate partners, household members, and state, 4 federal, and tribal law enforcement personnel to petition a court 5 for the removal of a firearm when there is a high or imminent risk 6 for violence; (2) the establishment of laws and procedures 7 through which physicians and other medical professionals can, 8 in partnership with appropriate stakeholders, contribute to the 9 inception and development of such petitions ; (2)(3) prohibiting 10 persons who are under domestic violence restraining orders, 11 convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes or stalking, 12 from possessing or purchasing firearms; (3)(4) expanding 13 domestic violence restraining orders to include dating partners; 14 (4)(5) requiring states to have protocols or processes in place for 15 requiring the removal of firearms by prohibited persons; (5)(6) 16 requiring domestic violence restraining orders and gun violence 17 restraining orders to be entered into the National Instant 18 Criminal Background Check System; and (6)(7) efforts to ensure 19 the public is aware of the existence of laws that allow for the 20 removal of firearms from high -risk individuals.

Our AMA: (a) will oppose any restrictions on physicians' and other members of the physician- led health care team's ability to inquire and talk about firearm safety issues and risks with thei r patients; (b) will oppose any law restricting physicians' and other members of the physician- led health care team's discussions with patients and their families about firearms as an intrusion into medical privacy; and (c) encourages dissemination of educ ational materials related to firearm safety to be used in undergraduate medical education. 2. Our AMA will work with appropriate stakeholders to develop state- specific guidance for physicians on how to counsel patients to reduce their risk for firearm- related injury or death, including guidance on when and how to ask sensitive questions about firearm ownership, access, and use, and clarification on the circumstances under which physicians are permitted or may be required to disclose the content of such conv ersations to family members, law enforcement, or other third parties. 3. Our AMA will support the development of reimbursement structures that incentivize physicians to counsel patients on firearm -related injury risk and prevention. 4. Our AMA supports the inclusion of firearm- related violence and suicide epidemiology, as well as evidence- based firearm- related injury prevention education in undergraduate and graduate medical education training programs, where appropriate.

Our AMA supports: a) federal and state research on firearm- related injuries and deaths; b) increased funding for and the use of state and national firearms injury databases, including the expansion of the National Violent Death Reporting Sys tem to all 50 states and U.S. territories, to inform state and federal health policy; c) encouraging physicians to access evidence- based data regarding firearm safety to educate and counsel patients about firearm safety; d) the rights of physicians to have free and open communication with their patients regarding firearm safety and the use of gun locks in their homes; e) encouraging local projects to facilitate the low -cost distribution of gun locks in homes; f) encouraging physicians to become involved in local firearm safety classes as a means of promoting injury prevention and the public health; and g) encouraging CME providers to consider, as appropriate, inclusion of presentations about the prevention of gun violence in national, state, and local continuing medical education programs. 2. Our AMA supports initiatives to enhance access to mental and cognitive health care, with greater focus on the diagnosis and management of mental illness and concurrent substance use disorders, and work with state and specialty medical societies and other interested stakeholders to identify and develop standardized approaches to mental health assessment for potential violent behavior. 3. Our AMA (a) recognizes the role of firearms in suicides, (b) encourages the development of curricula and training for physicians with a focus on suicide risk assessment and prevention as well as lethal means safety counseling, and (c) encourages physicians, as a part of their suicide prevention strategy, to discuss lethal means safety and w ork with families to reduce access to lethal means of suicide. 4. Our AMA and other organizations will develop and disseminate a formal educational program to enable clinicians to effectively and efficiently address suicides with an emphasis on seniors and other high -risk populations. 5. Our AMA will develop with other interested organizations a toolkit for clinicians to use addressing Extreme Risk Protection Orders in their individual states. 6. Our AMA will partner with other groups interested in firearm safety to raise public awareness of the magnitude of suicide in seniors and other high- risk populations, and interventions available for suicide prevention. 7. Our AMA and all interested medical societies will: (a) educate physicians about firearm epidemi ology, anticipatory guidance, and lethal means screening for and exploring potential restrictions to access to high-lethality means of suicide such as firearms. Health care clinicians, including trainees, should be provided training on the importance of anticipatory guidance and lethal means counseling to decrease firearm injuries and deaths and be provided training introducing evidence- based techniques, skills and strategies for having these discussions with patients and families; (b) educate physicians ab out lethal means counseling in health care settings and intervention options to remove lethal means, either permanently or temporarily from the home.

Our AMA: (a) advocates a waiting period and background check for all firearm purchasers; (b) encourages legislation that enforces a waiting period and background check for all firearm purchasers; and (c) urges legislation to prohibit the manufacture, sale or import of lethal and non- lethal guns made of plastic, ceramics, or other non- metallic materials that cannot be detected by airport and weapon detection devices. 2. Our AMA supports requiring the licensing/permitting of firearms -owners and purchasers, including the completion of a required safety course, and registration of all firearms. 3. Our AMA supports \"gun violence restraining orders\" for individuals arrested or convicted of domestic violence or stalking, and supports extreme risk protection orders, commonly known as \"red- flag\" laws, for individuals who have demonstrated significant signs of potential violence. In supporting restraining orders and \"red- flag\" laws, we also support the importance of due process so that individuals can petition for their rights to be restored.

Citation: Res. 214, I -16; Firearms as a Public Health Problem in the United States - Injuries and Death H -145.997 1. Our AMA recognizes that uncontrolled ownership and use of firearms, especially handguns, is a serious threat to the public's health inasmuch as the weapons are one of the main causes of intentional and unintentional injuries and deat hs. Therefore, the AMA: (A) encourages and endorses the development and presentation of safety education programs that will engender more responsible use and storage of firearms; (B) urges that government agencies, the CDC in particular, enlarge their efforts in the study of firearm- related injuries and in the development of ways and means of reducing such injuries and deaths; (C) urges Congress to enact needed legislation to regulate more effectively the importation and interstate traffic of all handgu ns; (D) urges the Congress to support recent legislative efforts to ban the manufacture and importation of nonmetallic, not readily detectable weapons, which also resemble toy guns; (5) encourages the improvement or modification of firearms so as to make them as safe as humanly possible; (E) encourages nongovernmental organizations to develop and test new, less hazardous designs for firearms; (F) urges that a significant portion of any funds recovered from firearms manufacturers and dealers through legal proceedings be used for gun safety education and gun- violence prevention; and Resolution: 405 (A-23) Page 7 of 9 (G) strongly urges US legislators to fund further research into the epidemiology of risks related to gun violence on a national level. 2. Our AMA will advocate for firearm safety features, including but not limited to mechanical or smart technology, to reduce accidental discharge of a firearm or misappropriation of the weapon by a non-registered user; and support legislation and regulation to standardize the use of these firearm saf ety features on weapons sold for non- military and non- peace officer use within the U.S.; with the aim of establishing manufacturer liability for the absence of safety features on newly manufactured firearms. 3. Our AMA will support research examining the major sources of illegally possessed firearms, as well as possible methods of decreasing their proliferation in the United States. 4. Our AMA will work with key stakeholders including, but not limited to, firearm manufacturers, firearm advocacy groups, law enforcement agencies, public health agencies, firearm injury victims advocacy groups, healthcare providers, and state and federal government agencies to develop evidence- informed public health recommendations to mitigate the effects of violence committed with firearms. 5. Our AMA will collaborate with key stakeholders and advocate for national public forums including, but not limited to, online venues, national radio, and televised/streamed in- person town halls, that bring together key stakeholders and members of the general public to focus on finding common ground, non-partisan measures to mitigate the effects of firearms in our firearm injury public health crisis.

RELEVANT AMA POLICY Support for Persons with Intellectual Disabilities H -90.967 Our AMA encourages appropriate government agencies, non- profit organizations, and specialty societies to develop and implement policy guidelines to provide adequate psychosocial resources for persons with intellectual disabilities, with the goal of independent function when possible. Citation: Res. 01, A -16; Preserving Protections of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 D -90.992 1. Our AMA supports legislative changes to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, to educate state and local government officials and property owners on strategies for promoting access to persons with a disability. 2. Our AMA opposes legislation amending the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, that would increase barriers for disabled persons attempting to file suit to challenge a violation of their civil rights. 3. Our AMA will develop educational tools and strategies to help physicians make their offices more accessible to persons with disabilities, consistent with the Americans With Disabilities Act as well as any applicable state laws. Citation: Res. 220, I -17; Enhancing Accommodations for People with Disabilities H -90.971 Our AMA encourages physicians to make their offices accessible to patients with disabilities, consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) guidelines. Citation: (Res. 705, A -13) Early Intervention for Individuals with Developmental Delay H -90.969 (1) Our AMA will continue to work with appropriate medical specialty societies to educate and enable physicians to identify children with developmental delay, autism and other developmental disabilities, and to urge physicians to assist parents in obtaining access to appropriate individualized early intervention services. (2) Our AMA supports a simplified process across appropriate government agencies to designate individuals with intellectual disabilities as a medically underserved population. Citation: CCB/CLRPD Rep. 3, A -14; Reaffirmed: Res. 315, A -17; SSI Benefi ts for Children with Disabilities H -90.986 The AMA will use all appropriate means to inform members about national outreach efforts to find and refer children who may qualify for Supplemental Security Income benefits to the Social Security Administration and promote and publicize the new rules for determining disability. Citation: (Res. 420, A -92; Reaffirmed: CMS Rep. 10, A -03; Reaffirmed: CMS Rep. 4, A- 13) Support for Housing Modification Policies H -160.890 Our AMA supports improved access to housing modification benefits for populations that require modifications in order to mitigate preventable health conditions, including but not limited to the elderly, the disabled and other persons with physical and/or mental disabilities. Resolution: 406 (A-23) Page 4 of 4 Citation: Res. 806, I -19; Federal Legislation on Access to Community -Based Services for People with Disabilities H - 290.970 Our AMA strongly supports reform of the Medicaid program established under title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396) to provide services in the most appropriate settings based upon the individual's needs, and to provide equal access to community -based attendant services and supports. Citation: Res. 917, I -07; Reaffirmed: BOT Rep. 22, A -17; AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 407 (A-23) Introduced by: Medical Student Section Subject: Addressing Inequity in Onsite Wastewater Treatment Referred to: Reference Committee D Whereas, 'Wastewater' refers to any water that has been used for human activity, and is 1 most commonly produced through the everyday use of water by homes and businesses and 2 is contaminated with feces, urine, soaps, industrial wastes, and other organic matter, making 3 it unsuitable for reintroduction into the natural water supply1; and 4 5 Whereas, In the United States, wastewater is often piped to centralized treatment facilities 6 where bulk products are strained, smaller pollutants are filtered or degraded, and biological 7 pollutants are disinfected, after which resultant water is fed into local watersheds2; and 8 9 Whereas, Exposure to inadequately treated w astewater may occur through occupational 10 exposure, breathing in wastewater -contaminated soil particles, or repeated ingestion of 11 wastewater -contaminated foods, and can lead to various illnesses including diarrheal 12 illnesses, helminth and trematode infections, and various skin disorders3-10; and 13 14 Whereas, Wastewater can also contain heavy metals like arsenic, mercury, lead, and 15 cadmium that can lead to diseases like cancer, cardiovascular disease, developmental 16 disorders, renal dysfunction, and osteoporosis, among others10-17; and 17 18 Whereas, There are clear disparities in access to adequate wastewater management 19 systems, with Tribal communities, communities of color, lower income communities, and rural 20 communities disproportionately having insufficient wastewater management systems18-22; and 21 22 Whereas, In the United States, approximately 25% of residents do not have access to 23 underground sanitary sewers, which amounts to ~80 million people who must rely on onsite 24 wastewater treatment systems, otherwise known as septic tanks23; and 25 26 Whereas, Because septic tanks are complex and expensive to install and require permitting 27 from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), houses and businesses in many poor rural 28 communities resort to using \"straight pipe\" sanitation systems wherein untreated toxic 29 wastewater is released directly into the environment23-26; and 30 31 Whereas, The prevalence of straight pipe sanitation systems means that hundreds of 32 thousands to millions of homes across the country are utilizing dangerous sewage systems 33 and could be releasing dangerous wastewater into nearby soil, lakes, or streams, 34 disproportionately in marginalized communities27-29; and 35 36 Whereas, Despite recent investment in wastewater management systems in the Bipartisan 37 Infrastructure Act of 2021, systemic underinvestment in wastewater management from 38 federal, state, and local governments has led to a projected deficit of $1 trillion in funding by 39 203530,31; and 40 Resolution: 407 (A-23) Page 2 of 4 Whereas, Targeted research and investment by state governments into wastewater 1 treatment has yielded dividends, with efforts to implement improved agricultural and 2 stormwater management practices and build wastewater infrastructure from 2005 to 2013 in 3 North Carolina improved water quality in four stream segments by 2014, while price changes 4 and sewage system physical improvements such as pipe replacement and high- quality, 5 durable material usage led to a 12% decline in in -county sewage and a 41% decline in out -of- 6 county sewage in northern Georgia18,22,32; and 7 8 Whereas, The Clean Water Act establishes the structure for regulating pollutant discharge 9 and maintaining water quality standards and requires that to discharge pollutants into a point 10 source, a person must obtain a permit through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination 11 System (NPDES) and are subject to \"a fine of not less than $5,000 nor more than $50,000 12 per day of violation, or by imprisonment for not more than three years, or both\" for permit 13 violations33; and 14 15 Whereas, Homes and businesses that use public \"sanitary sewage\" systems, including 16 straight pipe sanitation systems, do not need an NPDES permit and are regulated by their 17 local municipalities instead of by the EPA, indicating hundreds of thousands in the United 18 States use water treatment systems that are not regulated by the EPA and thus may be 19 releasing toxic wastewater into the environment24-26,33; and 20 21 Whereas, Many state laws do not comprehensively address on -site wastewater management, 22 and those that do lack the flexible framework needed to support diverse communities34; and 23 24 Whereas, Some states have provided local jurisdictions with additional regulatory power to 25 correct straight -pipe systems, such as a Minnesota law that allows municipalities to charge 26 $500 per month to the owners of all straight -pipe sy stems not corrected after ten months of 27 non-compliance35; and 28 29 Whereas, Some states have enacted programs to modernize and correct failed sewage 30 systems, but these programs are often underfunded, which the EPA has concluded leads to 31 continued contamination of local water systems36,37; and 32 33 Whereas, When not paired with adequate funding to assist municipalities to transition to safer 34 wastewater management systems, punitive actions often fail to incentivize investments in 35 improved wastewater management, and instead place an undue burden on what are often 36 already struggling communities23,25; and 37 38 Whereas, Innovative legislation like the Decentralized Wastewater Grant Act of 2020 which 39 established a grant program to allow low -income households to connect their homes to 40 existing wastewater infrastructures can provide communities aff ordable paths to make 41 necessary transitions to safer and more effective wastewater management systems, but are 42 insufficiently funded38,39; therefore be it 43 44 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association support that federal, state, and local 45 governments abate individual financial and criminal penalties for insufficient wastewater 46 management, especially those placed on underserved communities and American Indian 47 reservations due to environmental racism and socioeconomic disparities (New HOD Policy) ; 48 and be it further 49 Resolution: 407 (A-23) Page 3 of 4 RESOLVED, That our AMA support research by federal, state, and local governments to 1 develop strategies to reduce insufficient wastewater management and eliminate detrimental 2 health effects due to inadequate wastewater systems.

RELEVANT AMA POLICY Support Public Health Approaches for the Prevention and Management of Contagious Diseases in Correctional and Detention Facilities H -430.979 1. Our AMA, in collaboration with state and national medical specialty societies and other relevant stakeholders, will advocate for the improvement of conditions of incarceration in all correctional and immigrant detention facilities to allow for the implementation of evidence- based COVID -19 infection prevention and control g uidance. 2. Our AMA will advocate for adequate access to personal protective equipment and SARS -CoV-2 testing kits, sanitizing and disinfecting equipment for correctional and detention facilities. 3. Our AMA will advocate for humane and safe quarantine protocols for individuals who are incarcerated or detained that test positive for or are exposed to SARS -CoV-2, or other contagious respiratory pathogens. 4. Our AMA supports expanded data reporting, to include testing rates and demographic breakdown for SARS- CoV-2 and other contagious infectious disease cases and deaths in correctional and detention facilities. 5. Our AMA recognizes that detention center and correctional workers, incarcerated persons, and detained immigrants are at high- risk for COVID -19 infection and therefore should be prioritized in receiving access to safe, effective COVID -19 vaccine in the initial phases of distribution, and that this policy will be shared with the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for consideration in making their final recommendations on COVID -19 vaccine allocation. 6. Our AMA will advocate: (a) for all employees working in a correctional facility or detention center to be up to date with vaccinations against COVID -19, unless there is a valid medical contraind ication; (b) for all employees working in a correctional facility or detention center, not up to date with vaccination for COVID -19 to be COVID rapid tested each time they enter a correctional facility or detention center, as consistent with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or local public health guidelines; (c) for correctional facility or detention center policies that require non- employed, non- residents (e.g. visitors, contractors, etc.) to either show evidence of being up to date for COV ID-19 vaccines or show proof of a negative COVID test when they enter a correctional facility or detention center as consistent with CDC or local public health guidelines, at no cost to the visitor; (d) that all people inside a correctional facility or detention center wear an appropriate mask at all times, except while eating or drinking or at a 6 ft. distance from anyone else if local transmission rate is above low risk as determined by the CDC; and (e) that correctional facilities or detention centers be able to request and receive all necessary funding for COVID -19 vaccination and testing, according to CDC or local public health guidelines.

Citation: Res. 404, A -17; Health Care While Incarcerated H -430.986 1. Our AMA advocates for adequate payment to health care providers, including primary care and mental health, and addiction treatment professionals, to encourage improved access to comprehensive physical and behaviora l health care services to juveniles and adults throughout the incarceration process from intake to re- entry into the community. 2. Our AMA advocates and requires a smooth transition including partnerships and information sharing between correctional systems, community health systems and state insurance programs to provide access to a continuum of health care services for juveniles and adults in the correctional system. 3. Our AMA encourages state Medicaid agencies to accept and process Medicaid applications from juveniles and adults who are incarcerated. 4. Our AMA encourages state Medicaid agencies to work with their local departments of corrections, prisons, and jails to assist incarcerated juveniles and adults who may not have been enrolled in Medicaid at the time of their incarceration to apply and receive an eligibility determination for Medicaid. 5. Our AMA advocates for states to suspend rather than terminate Medicaid eligibility of juveniles and adults upon intake into the criminal legal system and throughout the incarceration process, and to reinstate coverage when the individual transitions back into the community. 6. Our AMA advocates for Congress to repeal the \"inmate exclusion\" of the 1965 Social Security Act that bars the use of federal Medicaid matching funds from covering healthcare services in jails and prisons. 7.Our AMA advocates for Congress and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to revise the Medicare statute and rescind related regulations that prevent payment for medical c are furnished to a Medicare beneficiary who is incarcerated or in custody at the time the services are delivered. 8. Our AMA advocates for necessary programs and staff training to address the distinctive health care needs of women and adolescent females who are incarcerated, including gynecological care and obstetrics care for individuals who are pregnant or postpartum. 9. Our AMA will collaborate with state medical societies, relevant medical specialty societies, and federal regulators to emphasize the importance of hygiene and health literacy information sessions, as well as information sessions on the science of addiction, evidence- based addiction treatment including medications, and related stigma reduction, for both individuals who are incarcerated and staff in correctional facilities. 10. Our AMA supports: (a) linkage of those incarcerated to community clinics upon release in order to accelerate access to comprehensive health care, including mental health and substance use disorder services, and improve health outcomes among this vulnerable patient population, as well as adequate funding; (b) the collaboration of correctional health workers and community health care providers for those transitioning from a correctional institution to the community; (c) t he provision of longitudinal care from state supported social workers, to perform foundational check -ins that not only assess mental health but also develop lifestyle plans with newly released people; and (d) collaboration with community -based organizations and integrated models of care that support formerly incarcerated people with regard to their health care, safety, and social determinant of health needs, including employment, education, and housing. 11. Our AMA advocates for the continuation of federal funding for health insurance benefits, including Medicaid, Medicare, and the Children's Health Insurance Program, for otherwise eligible individuals in pre-trial detention. 12. Our AMA advocates for the prohibition of the use of co- payments to access healt hcare services in correctional facilities. Citation: CMS Rep. 02, I -16; Appended: Res. 417, A -19; Appended: Res. Res. 127, A -22; Resolution: 408 (A-23) Page 5 of 9 Medications for Opioid Use Disorder in Correctional Facilities H -430.987 1. Our AMA endorses: (a) the medical treatment model of employing medications for opioid use disorder (OUD) as the standard of care for persons with OUD who are incarcerated; and (b) medications for persons with OUD who are incarcerated, an endorsement in collaboration with relevant organizations including but not limited to the American Society of Addiction Medicine and the American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry. 2. Our AMA advocates for legislation, standards, policies and funding that require correctional facilities to increase access to evidence- based treatment of OUD, including initiation and continuation of medications for OUD, in conjunction with psychosocial treatment when desired by the person wit h OUD, in correctional facilities within the United States and that this apply to all individuals who are incarcerated, including individuals who are pregnant, postpartum, or parenting. 3. Our AMA advocates for legislation, standards, policies, and funding that require correctional facilities within the United States to work in ongoing collaboration with addiction treatment physician- led teams, case managers, social workers, and pharmacies in the communities where patients, including individuals who are pr egnant, postpartum, or parenting, are released to offer post -incarceration treatment plans for OUD, including education, medication for addiction treatment and counseling, and medication for preventing overdose deaths, including naloxone (or any other medi cation that is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of an opioid overdose), and help ensure post - incarceration medical coverage and accessibility to mental health and substance use disorder treatments, that include medication and behavioral health and social supports for addiction treatment. 4. Our AMA advocates for all correctional facilities to use a validated screening tool to identify opioid withdrawal and take steps to determine potential need for treatment for OUD and opioid withdrawal syndrome for all persons upon entry.

If an increase in cases of tuberculosis or HIV infection is noted, more frequent retesting may be indicated; d) Correctional institutions should assure that informed consent, counseling, and confidentiality procedures are in place to protect the pati ent, when HIV testing is appropriate; e) During their post -test counseling procedures, HIV -infected inmates should be encouraged to confidentially notify their sexual or needle- sharing partners; and f) Correctional medical care must, as a minimum, meet the prevailing standards of care for HIV -infected persons in the outside community at large. Prisoners should have access to approved therapeutic drugs and generally employed treatment strategies. (2) HIV/AIDS Education and Prevention Our AMA: a) Encourages t he inclusion of HIV -prevention information as a regular part of correctional staff and inmate education. AIDS education in state and federal prisons should stress abstinence from drug use and high- risk sexual practices, as well as the proper use of condoms as one way of decreasing the spread of HIV; b) Will pursue legislation that encourages state, local, and federal correctional institutions to make condoms available to inmates; and c) Urges medical personnel in correctional institutions to work closely wi th state and local health department personnel to control the spread of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and other serious infectious diseases within and outside these facilities. (3) Prison -based HIV Partner Notification Program Our AMA: a) Urges state health departments to take steps to initiate with state departments of correctional services the development of prison- based HIV Partner Notification Programs for inmates convicted of drug- related crimes and their regular sexual partners; and b) Believes that all par ties should recognize that maximum effectiveness in an HIV Partner Notification Program will depend on the truly voluntary participation of inmates and the strict observance of confidentiality at all levels. Citation: (CSA Rep. 4, A -03; Modified: CSAPH Rep. 1, A -13) Disease Prevention and Health Promotion in Correctional Institutions H -430.989 Our AMA urges state and local health departments to develop plans that would foster closer working relations between the criminal justice, medical, and public health systems toward the prevention and control of HIV/AIDS, substance abuse, tuberculosis, hepatitis, and other infectious diseases. Some of Resolution: 408 (A-23) Page 6 of 9 these plans should have as their objectives: (a) an increase in collaborative efforts between parole officers and drug treatment center staff in case management aimed at helping patients to continue in treatment and to remain drug free; (b) an increase in direct referral by correctional systems of parolees with a recent, active history of intravenous drug use to drug treat ment centers; and (c) consideration by judicial authorities of assigning individuals to drug treatment programs as a sentence or in connection with sentencing. Citation: CSA Rep. 4, A -03; Modified: CSAPH Rep. 1, A -13; Modified: Alt. Res. 404, I -20; Update on Tuberculosis H -440.931 It is the policy of the AMA that: (1) All prison inmates should be tuberculin skin- tested upon arrival and annually thereafter. Those who are positive should be managed as medically appropriate, contact tracing performed, and provisions made for the continued treatment and follow -up of those who are released prior to the completion of their therapy. (2) Staff of both prisons and jails should be tuberculin- tested upon employment and annually thereafter. Those who are positive shoul d be managed as medically appropriate and contact tracing performed. (3) Both public and health care worker education about TB, its transmission, and the necessity for preventive as well as therapeutic treatment should be increased. (4) Current CDC guideli nes for the prevention of tuberculosis in congregate settings should be fully implemented. The protection of persons who are immunocompromised needs to be addressed especially by treatment centers housing such persons. (5) While powered air -purification respirators may be useful for the protection of HIV -infected and other immunocompromised health care workers who care for patients with infectious TB, their routine use for the prevention of the nosocomial transmission of TB is uncalled for in health care facilities where CDC guidelines are fully implemented. (6) States should review their TB control laws using current CDC recommendations and recent legal and ethical publications as guidelines. Where necessary to further protect the public health from the dis ease, existing laws should be modified and/or new ones added. Citation: (BOT Rep. JJ, A -93; Reaffirmed: CSA Rep. 8, A -03; Modified: CSAPH Rep. 1, A -13) Health Status of Detained and Incarcerated Youth H -60.986 Our AMA (1) encourages state and county medical societies to become involved in the provision of adolescent health care within detention and correctional facilities and to work to ensure that these facilities meet minimum national accreditation standards for health care as established by the Nat ional Commission on Correctional Health Care; (2) encourages state and county medical societies to work with the administrators of juvenile correctional facilities and with the public officials responsible for these facilities to discourage the following inappropriate practices: (a) the detention and incarceration of youth for reasons related to mental illness; (b) the detention and incarceration of children and youth in adult jails; and (c) the use of experimental therapies, not supported by scientific ev idence, to alter behavior. (3) encourages state medical and psychiatric societies and other mental health professionals to work with the state chapters of the American Academy of Pediatrics and other interested groups to survey the juvenile correctional f acilities within their state in order to determine the availability and quality of medical services provided. (4) advocates for increased availability of educational programs by the National Commission on Correctional Health Care and other community organ izations to educate adolescents about sexually transmitted diseases, including juveniles in the justice system.

Citation : Res. 926, I -19; AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 409 (A-23) Introduced by: Medical Student Section Subject: Expanding Inclusion of Diverse Mannequins Used in CPR and AED Training Referred to: Reference Committee D Whereas, Out -of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) results from a sudden circulatory collapse 1 and it is fatal without rapid cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and/or defibrillation1; and 2 3 Whereas, Bystander CPR is performed by a person who is not within the organized 4 emergency -response system, and has been identified as a necessary intervention to improve 5 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest surviv al2; and 6 7 Whereas, Every minute of delay in CPR results in a 10% decrease in survival rate, with 8 OHCA being responsible for over 350,000 deaths per year in the United States with an 9 estimated overall survival of 10%3-5; and 10 11 Whereas, Key strategies to improve survival include early recognition and activation of the 12 Emergency Response System, early CPR, rapid defibrillation and an increase in rates of 13 bystander CPR5,6; and 14 15 Whereas, The American Heart Association (AHA) and supporting research recognize that 16 women are less likely than men to receive CPR or AED application from a bystander, and 17 even emergency medical services (EMS) are less likely to resuscitate women7-9; and 18 19 Whereas, Although OHCA rates are similar across genders, women have overall lower 20 survival rates following CPR intervention or hospital discharge, which may be due to 21 bystander hesitance to remove clothing items8,10,11; and 22 23 Whereas, Concerns regarding accusations of sexual harassment or inappropriate touching, 24 discomfort with breasts, and fears of injuring women are commonly cited by the public, 25 particularly men, as reasons why women are less likely to receive bystander CPR in 26 instances of OHCA, though delays in CPR intervention have been found to be more costly 27 than concerns related to performing CPR12,13; and 28 29 Whereas, While factors impacting CPR quality, such as clothing removal and hand 30 placement, are impacted by the sex of the CPR mannequin utilized in training, 98.4% of 31 almost 900 online CPR instructional videos use a male patient or mannequin without female 32 anatomy, and none discussed female- specific barriers to CPR or defibrillation10,14; and 33 34 Whereas, A study of the diversity of mannequins used across North and Latin America found 35 only 12% were non -white, 6% represented women, <1% represented a non- lean body 36 habitus, and 1% represented pregnant individuals15; and 37 38 Whereas, While CPR intervention during pregnancy does not differ from standard CPR 39 intervention other than manual left uterine displacement, studies show higher maternal 40 Resolution: 409 (A-23) Page 2 of 5 mortality rates due to hesitancy of performing CPR due to concerns of inflicting harm on the 1 patient16; and 2 3 Whereas, In a 2022 study performed in Australia, provider confidence for performing CPR on 4 individuals with physical disabilities or abnormal chest shape was significantly improved by a 5 supplemental training course17; and 6 7 Whereas, Though The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitat ion (ILCOR) 8 recommends a depth of between 5cm and 6cm for adult chest compressions, the optimal 9 chest compression depth recommended by ILCOR is unlikely to be sufficient when 10 performing CPR on a patient with obesity18-20; and 11 12 Whereas, Patients with body mass index classifications of \"obese\" or \"underweight\" are 13 associated with higher rates of in- hospital mortality following out of hospital cardiac arrest24; 14 and 15 16 Whereas, There are still health disparities in OHCA survival rates due to a lack of 17 competen cy in CPR and AED delivery for women, pregnant people, people with physical 18 disabilities, and people with obesity8,10,11,16,17,21; and 19 20 Whereas, Options for increasing diversity of CPR mannequins include the utilization of 21 different skin colors, body types, and genders, or purchasing kits which can add breasts to a 22 \"male\" chested mannequin on which a bra can be attached15; and 23 24 Whereas, Current cost -effective methods to diversify primarily male CPR mannequins include 25 the Womanikin, an open -source design, or low -cost female accessory packs to add breasts 26 to existing mannequins, indicating that existing mannequins can be modified to addres s 27 current differences in OHCA survival following CPR intervention22,23; and 28 29 Whereas, Options for CPR mannequins representing pregnant persons or persons with 30 physical disabilities are not widely available; and 31 32 Whereas, While 2020 American Heart Association guidelines for CPR and emergency 33 cardiovascular care states that it is reasonable to address barriers to bystander CPR for 34 female victims through educational training and public awareness efforts, it is clear additional 35 action needs to be taken in order to address the disparities noted in OHCA CPR 36 intervention24; and 37 38 Whereas, Teaching materials used in American Heart Association Advanced Certified Life 39 Support (ACLS) training have previously been found to insufficiently reflect races and gender 40 at risk of requiring CPR25; and 41 42 Whereas, AMA policy H -130. 938 outlines guidelines for CPR training for the American public, 43 but it fails to address key healthcare inequities that exist in CPR education and intervention 44 among minority groups ; therefore be it 45 46 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association support use of diverse mannequins in 47 CPR and AED training, including, but not limited to, mannequins with breasts, mannequins 48 representing pregnant persons, mannequins representing persons with disabilities, and 49 mannequins of varying body sizes (New HOD P olicy) ; and be it further 50 Resolution: 409 (A-23) Page 3 of 5 RESOLVED, That our AMA support the efforts of relevant stakeholders to develop diverse 1 mannequins or modify current mannequins to reflect diverse patient populations, including, 2 but not limited to, those representing pregnant persons or persons with physical disabilities 3 (New HOD Policy); and be it further 4 5 RESOLVED, That our AMA collaborate with relevant stakeholders to increase accessibility of 6 CPR and AED training equipment representing diverse gender and body types in basic life 7 support and advanced certified life support programs nationwide to ensure optimal 8 competency for trainees of all education levels .

Defibrillators H -130.938 Our AMA: (1) supports publicizing the importance of teaching CPR, including the use of automated external defibrillation; (2) strongly recommends the incorporation of CPR classes as a voluntary part of secondary school programs; (3) encourages the American public to become trained in CPR and the use of automated external defibrillators; (4) advocates the widespread placement of automated external defibrillators, including on all grade K -12 school campuses and locations at which school events are held; (5) encourages all grade K -12 schools to develop an emergency action plan for sudden cardiac events; (6) supports increasing government and industry funding for the purchase of automated external defibrillator devices; (7) endorses increased funding for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation training of community organization and school personnel; (8) supports the development and use of universal connectivity for all defibrillators; (9) supports legislation that would encourage high school students be trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and automat ed external defibrillator use; (10) will update its policy on cardiopulmonary resuscitation and automated external defibrillators (AEDs) by endorsing efforts to promote the importance of AED use and public awareness of AED locations, by using solutions suc h as integrating AED sites into widely accessible mobile maps and applications; (11) urges AED vendors to remove labeling from AED stations that stipulate that only trained medical professionals can use the defibrillators; and (12) supports consistent and uniform legislation across states for the legal protection of those who use AEDs in the course of attempting to aid a sudden cardiac arrest victim.

Citation: CCB/CLRPD Rep. 3, A -14; Modified: CME Rep. 1, A -22; Resolution: 409 (A-23) Page 5 of 5 E-8.5 Disparities in Health Care Stereotypes, prejudice, or bias based on gender expectations and other arbitrary evaluations of any individual can manifest in a variety of subtle ways. Differences in treatment that are not directly related to differences in individual patients' clinical needs or preferences constitute inappropriate variations in health care. Such variations may contribute to health outcomes that are considerably worse in members of some populations than those of members of majority populations. This represents a significant challenge for physicians, who ethically are called on to provide the same quality of care to all patients without regard to medically irrelevant personal characteristics. To fulfill this professional obligation in their individual practices physicians should: (a) Provide care that meets patient needs and respects patient preferences. (b) Avoid stereotyping patients. (c) Examine their own practices to ensure that inappropriate considerations about race, gender identify, sexual orientation, sociodemographic factors, or other nonclinical factors, do not affect clinical judgment. (d) Work to eliminate biased behavior toward patients by other health care professionals and staff who come into contact with patients. (e) Encourage shared decision making. (f) Cultivate effective communication and trust by seeking to better understand factors that can influence patients' health care decisions, such as cultural traditions, health beliefs and health literacy, language or other barriers to communication and fears or misperceptions about the health care system. The medical profession has an ethical responsibility to: (g) Help increase awareness of health care disparities. (h) Strive to increase the diversity of the physician workforce as a step toward reducing health care disparities. (i) Support research that examines health care disparities, including research on the unique health needs of all genders, ethnic groups, and medically disadvantaged populations, and the development of qualit y measures and resources to help reduce disparities. Issued: 2016 Inclusion of Women in Clinical Trials H -525.991 Our AMA: (1) encourages the inclusion of women, including pregnant women when appropriate, in all research on human subjects, except in those cases for which it would be scientifically irrational, in numbers sufficient to ensure that results of such research will benefit both men and women alike; (2) supports the National Institutes of Health policy requiring investigators to account for t he possible role of sex as a biological variable in vertebrate animal and human studies; and (3) encourages translation of important research results into practice. Citation: Res. 183, I -90; Reaffirmed: Sunset Report, -16; Reaffirmed: Res. 909, I -16; AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 410 (A-23) Introduced by: Medical Student Section Subject: Formal Transitional Care Program for Children and Youth with Special Health Care Needs Referred to: Reference Committee D Whereas, Children and youth with special health care needs (CYSHCN) are those whose 1 health care needs are more complex and require specialized care for their physical, 2 behavioral, or emotional development beyond that required by children generally1; and 3 4 Whereas, \"Special health care needs\" include any chronic conditions, such as cystic fibrosis, 5 cerebral palsy, congenital defects/conditions, type 1 diabetes and other similar health 6 conditions1,2; and 7 8 Whereas, Almost 20% of children between 12 and 18 years of age have a special health care 9 need3; and 10 11 Whereas, People with disabilities are described as having an activity limitation or who use 12 assistance or perceive themselves as having a disability4; and 13 14 Whereas, Most of CYSHCN do not fall under the formal definition of \"disabled\"4; and 15 16 Whereas, 90% of CYSHCN, who previously faced high rates of childhood mortality, now 17 increasingly survive to adulthood due to advances in medicine and therefore need the 18 appropriate care they received as children and young adults5; and 19 20 Whereas, Pediatric practices do not routinely start planning for transition to adult care until 21 the patient is around 18 years of age, and many pediatric practices do not have the available 22 policies, plans, or educational materials for a proper trans ition6; and 23 24 Whereas, Adult clinicians often do not have the specific infrastructure, education, and training 25 to care for young adults with pediatric -onset conditions7; and 26 27 Whereas, Research demonstrates that CYSHCN currently are inadequately supported during 28 the transition from pediatric to adult health care6-9; and 29 30 Whereas, Transitioning from pediatric to adult services, particularly for CYSHCN, is 31 associated with decreased medication adherence, decreased patient engagement, increased 32 avoidable hospitalization, and other health risks like permanent end- organ damage and even 33 early death8, 10; and 34 35 Whereas, The transition to adult services occurs during a developmental period marked by 36 increased risky behavior, emphasizing the need for stability and clear planning to promote 37 good outcomes and continued treatment adherence11; and 38 Resolution: 410 (A-23) Page 2 of 7 Whereas, The ability of pediatricians and adult clinicians to communicate effectively during 1 the transition to adult care results in better health outcomes for the individual12; and 2 3 Whereas, The American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family 4 Physicians, and the American College of Physicians have released and reaffirmed a 5 consensus statement supporting high- quality, planned transitions of care for all youth, 6 especially CYSHCN13; and 7 8 Whereas, The American Academy of Pediatrics has published a clinical report that 9 establishes an algorithm and set of guidelines (the \"Transitional Clinical Report and 10 Algorithm\") to support the transition from adolescence to adult hood in the clinical home13; and 11 12 Whereas, After nearly 10 years of effort and research since the Transitional Clinical Report 13 and Algorithm was published, some effective models of transition systems were made by 14 reputable organizations, like National Standards for CYSHCN, but none have been nationally 15 established13,14; and 16 17 Whereas, Current AMA policy encourages physicians to establish transitional care programs 18 for children with disabilities (H -60.974), but existing language is not inclusive of all childr en 19 with special health care needs16; therefore be it 20 21 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association amend policy H -60.974 , Children and 22 Youth with Disabilities , by addition and deletion to read as follows, to strengthen our AMA 23 policy and to include a population of patients that do not fall under \"disability\" but also need 24 extra care, especially when transitioning to adult health care, that they are currently not 25 receiving due to a gap: 26 27 Children and Y outh with D isabilities and with Special 28 Healthcare Need H- 60.974 29 It is the policy of the AMA: (1) to inform physicians of the special health 30 care needs of children and youth with disabilities and children and youth 31 with special healthcare needs (CYSHCN) ; 32 (2) to encourage physicians to pay special attention during the preschool 33 physical examination to identify physical, emotional, or developmental 34 disabilities that have not been previously noted; 35 (3) to encourage physicians to provide services to children and youth with 36 disabilities and CYSHCN that are family -centered, community -based, and 37 coordinated among the various individual providers and programs serving 38 the child; 39 (4) to encourage physicians to provide schools with medical information 40 to ensure that children and youth with disabilities and CY SHCN receive 41 appropriate school health services; 42 (5) to encourage physicians to establish formal transition programs or 43 activities that help adolescents with disabilities , and CYSHCN, and their 44 families to plan and make the transition to the adult medical care system; 45 (6) to inform physicians of available educational and other local 46 resources, as well as various manuals that would help prepare them to 47 provide family -centered health care; and 48 Resolution: 410 (A-23) Page 3 of 7 (7) to encourage physicians to make their offices accessible to patients 1 with disabilities and CYSHCN, especially when doing office construction 2 and renovations.

Citation: CSA Rep. J, I -91; Modified: Sunset CSAPH Reaffirmed: CSAPH Rep. 1, A -21; Evidence- Based Principles of Discharge and Discharge Criteria H -160.942 (1) T he AMA defines discharge criteria as organized, evidence- based guidelines that protect patients' interests in the discharge process by following the principle that the needs of patients must be matched to settings with the ability to meet those needs. (2) The AMA calls on physicians, specialty societies, insurers, and other involved parties to join in developing, promoting, and using evidence- based discharge criteria that are sensitive to the physiological, psychological, social, and functional needs of pat ients and that are flexible to meet advances in medical and surgical therapies and adapt to local and regional variations in health care settings and services. (3) The AMA encourages incorporation of discharge criteria into practice parameters, clinical guidelines, and critical pathways that involve hospitalization. (4) The AMA promotes the local development, adaption and implementation of discharge criteria. (5) The AMA promotes training in the use of discharge criteria to assist in planning for patient care at all levels of medical education. Use of discharge criteria will improve understanding of the pathophysiology of disease processes, the continuum of care and therapeutic interventions, the use of health care resources and alternative sites of care, the importance of patient education, safety, outcomes measurements, and collaboration with allied health professionals. (6) The AMA encourages research in the following areas: clinical outcomes after care in different health care settings; the utilization of resources in different care settings; the actual costs of care from onset of illness to recovery; and reliable and valid ways of assessing the discharge needs of patients. (7) The AMA endorses the following principles in the development of evidence- based discharge criteria and an organized discharge process: (a) As tools for planning patients' transition from one care setting to another and for determining whether patients are ready for the transition, discharge criteria are intended to match patients' care needs to the setting in which their needs can best be met. (b) Discharge criteria consist of, but are not limited to: (i) Objective and subjective assessments of physiologic and symptomatic stability that are matched to the ability of the discharge set ting to monitor and provide care. (ii) The patient's care needs that are matched with the patient's, family's, or caregiving staff's independent understanding, willingness, and demonstrated performance prior to discharge of processes and procedures of self care, patient care, or care of dependents. (iii) The patient's functional status and impairments that are matched with the ability of the care givers and setting to adequately supplement the patients' function. (iv) The needs for medical follow -up that ar e matched with the likelihood that the patient will participate in the follow -up. Follow -up is time- , setting -, and service- dependent. Special considerations must be taken to ensure follow -up in vulnerable populations whose access to health care is limited. (c) The discharge process includes, but is not limited to: (i) Planning: Planning for transition/discharge must be based on a comprehensive assessment of the patient's physiological, psychological, social, and Resolution: 410 (A-23) Page 5 of 7 functional needs. The discharge planning pr ocess should begin early in the course of treatment for illness or injury (prehospitalization for elective cases) with involvement of patient, family and physician from the beginning. (ii) Teamwork: Discharge planning can best be done with a team consisting of the patient, the family, the physician with primary responsibility for continuing care of the patient, and other appropriate health care professionals as needed. (iii) Contingency Plans/Access to Medical Care: Contingency plans for unexpected adverse events must be in place before transition to settings with more limited resources. Patients and caregivers must be aware of signs and symptoms to report and have a clearly defined pathway to get information directly to the physician, and to receive instruc tions from the physician in a timely fashion. (iv) Responsibility/Accountability: Responsibility/accountability for an appropriate transition from one setting to another rests with the attending physician. If that physician will not be following the patient in the new setting, he or she is responsible for contacting the physician who will be accepting the care of the patient before transfer and ensuring that the new physician is fully informed about the patient's illness, course, prognosis, and needs for continuing care. If there is no physician able and willing to care for the patient in the new setting, the patient should not be discharged. Notwithstanding the attending physician's responsibility for continuity of patient care, the health care setting in w hich the patient is receiving care is also responsible for evaluating the patient's needs and assuring that those needs can be met in the setting to which the patient is to be transferred. (v) Communication: Transfer of all pertinent information about the patient (such as the history and physical, record of course of treatment in hospital, laboratory tests, medication lists, advanced directives, functional, psychological, social, and other assessments), and the discharge summary should be completed before or at the time of transfer of the patient to another setting. Patients should not be accepted by the new setting without a copy of this patient information and complete instructions for continued care. (8) The AMA supports the position that the care of the patient treated and discharged from a treating facility is done through mutual consent of the patient and the physician; and (9) Policy programs by Congress regarding patient discharge timing for specific types of treatment or procedures be discouraged.

(3) encourages states to ensure that within their Medicaid programs there is a pluralistic approach to health care financing delivery including a choice of primary care case management, partial capitation models, fee- for-service, medical savings accounts, benefit payment schedules and other approaches; (4) calls for states to create mechanisms for traditional Medicaid providers to continue to participate in Medicaid managed care and in State Children's Health Insurance Programs; (5) calls for states to streamline the enrollment process within their Medicaid programs and State Children's Health Insurance Programs by, for example, allowing mail -in applications, developing shorter application forms, coordinating their Medicaid and welfare (TANF) application processes, and placing eligibility workers in locations where potential beneficiaries work, go to school, attend day care, play, pray, and receive medical care; (6) urges states to administer their Medicaid and SCHIP programs through a single state agency; (7) strongly urges states to undertake, and encourages state medical associations, county medical societies, specialty societies, and individual physicians to take part in, educational and outreach activities aimed at Medica id-eligible and SCHIP -eligible children. Such efforts should be designed to ensure that children do not go without needed and available services for which they are eligible due to administrative barriers or lack of understanding of the programs; (8) suppor ts requiring states to reinvest savings achieved in Medicaid programs into expanding coverage for uninsured individuals, particularly children. Mechanisms for expanding coverage may include additional funding for the SCHIP earmarked to enroll children to h igher percentages of the poverty level; Medicaid expansions; providing premium subsidies or a buy -in option for individuals in families with income between their state's Medicaid income eligibility level and a specified percentage of the poverty level; providing some form of refundable, advanceable tax credits inversely related to income; providing vouchers for recipients to use to choose their own health plans; using Medicaid funds to purchase private health insurance coverage; or expansion of Maternal and Child Health Programs. Such expansions must be implemented to coordinate with the Medicaid and SCHIP programs in order to achieve a seamless health care delivery system, and be sufficiently funded to provide incentive for families to obtain adequate insur ance coverage for their children; (9) advocates consideration of various funding options for expanding coverage including, but not limited to: increases in sales tax on tobacco products; funds made available through for -profit conversions of health plans and/or facilities; and the application of prospective payment or other cost or utilization management techniques to hospital outpatient services, nursing home services, and home health care services; (10) supports modest co- pays or income- adjusted premium s hares for non- emergent, non- preventive services as a means of expanding access to coverage for currently uninsured individuals; (11) calls for CMS to develop better measurement, monitoring, and accountability systems and indices within the Medicaid program in order to assess the effectiveness of the program, particularly under managed care, in meeting the needs of patients. Such standards and measures should be linked to health outcomes and access to care; (12) supports innovative methods of increasing phys ician participation in the Medicaid program and thereby increasing access, such as plans of deferred compensation for Medicaid providers. Such plans allow individual physicians (with an individual Medicaid number) to tax defer a specified percentage of their Medicaid income; Resolution: 410 (A-23) Page 7 of 7 (13) supports increasing public and private investments in home and community -based care, such as adult day care, assisted living facilities, congregate living facilities, social health maintenance organizations, and respite care; (14) supports allowing states to use long- term care eligibility criteria which distinguish between persons who can be served in a home or community -based setting and those who can only be served safely and cost-effectively in a nursing facility. Such criteria should include measures of functional impairment which take into account impairments caused by cognitive and mental disorders and measures of medically related long- term care needs; (15) supports buy -ins for home and community -based care for persons with i ncomes and assets above Medicaid eligibility limits; and providing grants to states to develop new long- term care infrastructures and to encourage expansion of long- term care financing to middle- income families who need assistance; (16) supports efforts to assess the needs of individuals with intellectual disabilities and, as appropriate, shift them from institutional care in the direction of community living; (17) supports case management and disease management approaches to the coordination of care, in the managed care and the fee- for-service environments; (18) urges CMS to require states to use its simplified four -page combination Medicaid / Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) application form for enrollment in these programs, unless states can indicate they have a comparable or simpler form; and (19) urges CMS to ensure that Medicaid and CHIP outreach efforts are appropriately sensitive to cultural and language diversities in state or localities with large uninsured ethnic populations.

and 3 4 Whereas, Natural disasters have injured more than 2 million people in the last 10 years3; and 5 6 Whereas, From 1992 to 2006, an estimated 72 occupational deaths in the United States were 7 associated with hurricanes and 62 deaths were associated with non- hurricane floods4; and 8 9 Whereas, In 2019, nearly 3.5 million workers across all industries had work -related injuries 10 and illnesses that were reported by employers, with 2.8 million injuries and illnesses reported 11 in private industry5; and 12 13 Whereas, The 2019 Workplace Safety Index estimated the cost of the most disabling 14 workplace injuries to employers at more than $55 billion a year6; and 15 16 Whereas, Research shows that work -related injuries and illnesses are largely underreported7-17 9; and 18 19 Whereas, Between 2014 to 2017, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 20 investigated only a quarter of reported occupational deaths10; and 21 22 Whereas, M arginalized essential workers may be at increased risk of illness or injury during a 23 critical situation such as a pandemic due to the failure of their employer to provide basic 24 health safety protections11; and 25 26 Whereas, Employer failure of enforcing safety precautions was exemplified on December 10, 27 2021, when Amazon workers were not sent home before a tornado struck the warehouse, 28 despite hours of notice that severe weather was imminent, which ultimately killed six people 29 and injured many others12; and 30 31 Whereas, While the tragedy was multifactorial, some of the causes included Amazon telling 32 employees they could not leave, not telling workers to stay home, and failing to provide 33 workers with adequate emergency training in preparation for natural disasters such as 34 tornadoes13; and 35 36 Whereas, Amazon not only has a history of discouraging workers from taking time off during 37 national disasters, but also as having policies that prohibit workers from carrying their phones 38 on warehouse floors, requiring them to leave them in vehicles or employee lockers before 39 passing through security checks that included metal detectors14; and 40 Resolution: 411 (A-23) Page 2 of 8 Whereas, The OSHA requires most businesses to have Emergency Action Plans, which 1 include evacuation procedures, but US law leaves it up to employers to decide whether to 2 send employees home in response to natural disasters15; and 3 4 Whereas, Even when there are OSHA violations but no violation of law, the penalty for 5 companies are on the order of thousands of dollars, which is an insignificant cost to multi - 6 billion dollar companies16; and 7 8 Whereas, Many of the federal workplace standa rds for emergency response and 9 preparedness are decades out of date, are not comprehensive, and do not consider the 10 effects of climate change14; and 11 12 Whereas, OSHA does not have requirements for hospitals to develop evacuation plans in 13 case of a hurricane or other extreme weather event even though OSHA has been 14 \"considering updating these standards\" since at least 20144,17; and 15 16 Whereas, Employees who refused to drive to work when conditions were potentially unsafe 17 but their employers did not deem conditions to be dangerous are not federally protected, 18 including under the National Labor Relations A ct4; and 19 20 Whereas, The Environmental Protection Agency has projected that climate change will 21 continue to disproportionately impact underserved communities, affect ing many who cannot 22 afford the threat of losing their jobs18; and 23 24 Whereas, Many states do not provide full protection of workers against retaliation or threat of 25 retaliation during public health emergencies resulting in employees to attend their place of 26 employment out of fear of termination19; and 27 28 Whereas, Current AMA policy around catastrophe preparedness revolves around the medical 29 field response (D -130.972 and H -130.992) and the effects of climate change on natural 30 disasters and affected communities ( D-130.966, H -135.938 and H -135.973); and 31 32 Whereas, Our American Medical Association has limited policy advocating for the safety of 33 workers mainly focusing on heat exposure, with existing resolutions stating that the AMA will 34 work with United States Depart ment of Labor, OSHA, and other appropriate federal 35 stakeholders to develop and enforce evidence- based policies, guidelines, and protections 36 against heat injury for workers (D -135.967); and 37 38 Whereas, Current AMA policy: 1. Does not address its support for protecting all forms of 39 workers during various catastrophes, especially regarding workers who are penalized for 40 taking appropriate safety precautions, 2. Does not address working with stakeholders to 41 develop policies about workers traveling during catastrophes (D -135.967); and 42 43 Whereas, The Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Act requires employers to ensure a 44 safe workplace as outlined by a \"duty of care\" to protect their employees against an 45 unreasonable risk of harm ; however, this policy is applied vari ably as evidenced by how 46 many workplace injuries and deaths are caused by catastrophes4,20,21; therefore be it 47 Resolution: 411 (A-23) Page 3 of 8 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association advocate for legislation that creates 1 federal standards of safety and protection of workers during natural or man- made 2 catastrophes (Directive to Take Action); and be it further 3 4 RESOLVED, That our AMA advocate that the United States Department of Labor, the 5 Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and other appropriate stakeholders 6 develop and enforce evidence- based policies, guidelines, and protections for workers at their 7 place of employment and traveling to and from their place of employment during 8 catastrophes.

RELEVANT AMA POLICY All Hazards Disaster Preparedness and Response D -130.972 Our AMA will work with: (1) subject matter experts at the national level to quickly produce a provider manual on state licensure and medical liability coverage for physicians during disasters; (2) appropriate medical, public health, disaster response and relief organizations to improve plans, protocols, and policies regarding the provision of health care in mass evacuation shelters; and (3) appropriate state and local organizations to develop templates for private practice/office continuity plans in CD -ROM or web- based format that can be stored in state medical association offices on a server in the event of a disaster. Citation: (Res. 426, A -06; Reaffirmed in lieu of Res. 218, I -15) Proposed Crisis Relocation and Shelter Plans H -130.992 Patients must be treated regardless of how they are injured, and planning for treatment is an i mportant part of good medicine. The AMA, therefore, is committed to working with the federal government to provide advice concerning development of sound medical planning for disasters and catastrophes of any and all magnitude. Citation: (BOT Rep. I, I -82; Reaffirmed: Res. 34, Reaffirmed: CLRPD -03; Reaffirmed: CSAPH A- 13) Workers' Compensation H -365.981 Our AMA: (1) will promote the development of practice parameters, when appropriate, for use in the treatment of injured workers and encourages those experienced in the care of injured workers to participate in such development. (2) will investigate support for appropriate utilization review guidelines for referrals, appropriate procedures and tests, and ancillary services as a method of containing costs and curbing overutilization and fraud in the workers' compensation system. Any such utilization review should be based on open and consistent review criteria that are acceptable to and have been developed in concert with the medical profession. Physicians with background appropriate to the care under review should have the ultimate responsibility for determining quality and necessity of care. (3) encourages the use of the Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment. The correct use of the Guides can facilitate prompt dispute resolution by providing a single, scientifically developed, uniform, and objective means of evaluating medical impairment. (4) encourages physicians to participate in the development of workplace health and safety programs. Physician input into healthy lifestyle programs (the risks associated with alcohol and drug use, nutrition information, the benefits of exercise, for example) could be particularly helpful and appropriate. (5) encourages the use of uniform claim forms (CMS 1500, UB04), electronic billing (with appropriate mechanisms to protect the confidentiality of patient information), and familiar diagnostic coding guidelines (ICD-9-CM, CPT; ICD -10-CM, CPT), when appropriate, to facilitate prompt reporting and payment of workers' compensation claims. (6) will evaluate the concept of Independent Medical Examinations (IME) and make recommendations concerning IME's (i) effectiveness; (ii) process for identifying and credentialing ind ependent medical examiners; and (iii) requirements for continuing medical education for examiners. (7) encourages state medical societies to support strong legislative efforts to prevent fraud in workers' compensation. (8) will continue to monitor and evaluate state and federal health system reform proposals which propose some form of 24- hour coverage. (9) will continue to evaluate these and other medical care aspects of workers' compensation and make timely recommendations as appropriate.

Our AMA supports government eff orts to: (a) coordinate and integrate federal medical and public health disaster response entities such as the Medical Reserve Corps, National Disaster Medical System, Public Health Services Commissioned Corps (PHSCC), as well as state- to-state sponsored E mergency Management Compact Systems, to strengthen health system infrastructure and surge capacity for catastrophic disasters (Incidents of National Significance) as defined by the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) National Response Plan (NRP); and ( b) place all federal medical and public health disaster response assets (with the exception of the Department of Defense) under authority of the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to prevent significant delays and ensure coordi nation during a catastrophic disaster (Incident of National Significance). 2. Our AMA, through its Center for Public Health Preparedness and Disaster Response, will work with the DHHS, PHSCC, DHS, and other relevant government agencies to provide comprehensive disaster education and training for all federal medical and public health employees and volunteers through the National Disaster Life Support and other appropriate programs. Such training should address the medical and mental health needs of all popu lations, including children, the elderly, and other vulnerable groups. 3. Our AMA, through its Center for Public Health Preparedness and Disaster Response, will monitor progress in strengthening federal disaster medical and public health response capacity for deployment anywhere in the nation on short notice, and report back as appropriate.

Our American Medical Association lobby Congress to a) reassess its policy for expedited release of funding to disaster areas; b) define areas of disaster with disproportionate indirec t and direct consequences of disaster as \"public health emergencies\"; and c) explore a separate, less bureaucratic process for providing funding and resources to these areas in an effort to reduce morbidity and mortality post-disaster. 2. Our AMA will lobby actively for the recommendations outlined in the AMA/APHA Linkages Leadership Summit including: a) appropriate funding and protection of public health and health care systems as critical infrastructures for responding to day -to-day emergencies and mass c ausality events; b) full Resolution: 411 (A-23) Page 6 of 8 integration and interoperable public health and health care disaster preparedness and response systems at all government levels; c) adequate legal protection in a disaster for public health and healthcare responders and d) incorpor ation of disaster preparedness and response competency -based education and training in undergraduate, graduate, post -graduate, and continuing education programs. Citation: (Res. 421, A -11; Reaffirmation A -15) Heat -Related Illness H -130.951 The AMA recogni zes the significant public health threat imposed by heat -related emergencies, and provides the following policy: (1) Physicians should identify patients at risk for extreme heat -related illness such as the elderly, children, individuals with physical or mental disabilities, alcoholics, the chronically ill, and the socially isolated. Patients, family members, friends, and caretakers should be counseled about prevention strategies to avoid such illness. Physicians should provide patients at risk with informat ion about cooling centers and encourage their use during heat emergencies.

RELEVANT AMA POLICY Access to Basic Human Services for Transgender Individuals H -65.964 Our AMA: (1) opposes policies preventing transgender individuals from accessing basic human services and public facilities in line with ones gender identity, including , but not limited to, the use of restrooms; and (2) will advocate for the creation of policies that promote social equality and safe access to basic human services and public facilities for transgender individuals according to ones gender identity. Citatio n: Res. 010, A -17; Health Care Needs of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Populations H -160.991 1. Our AMA: (a) believes that the physician's nonjudgmental recognition of patients' sexual orientations, sexual behaviors, and gender identities enhances the ability to render optimal patient care in health as well as in illness. In the case of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, and other (LGBTQ) patients, this recognition is especially important to address the specific health care needs of people who are or may be LGBTQ; (b) is committed to taking a leadership role in: (i) educating physicians on the current state of research in and knowledge of LGBTQ Health and the need to elicit relevant gender and sexuality information from our patients; these efforts should start in medical school, but must also be a part of continuing medical education; (ii) educating physicians to recognize the physical and psychological needs of LGBTQ patients; (iii) encouraging the development of educational programs in LGBTQ Health; (iv) encouraging physicians to seek out local or national experts in the health care needs of LGBTQ people so that all physicians will achieve a better understanding of the medical needs of these populations; and (v) working with LGBTQ communities to offer physicians the opportunity to better understand the medical needs of LGBTQ patients; and (c) opposes, the use of \"reparative\" or \"conversion\" therapy for sexual orientation or gender identity. 2. Our AMA will collaborate with our partner organizations to educate physicians regarding: (i) the need for sexual and gender minority individuals to undergo regular cancer and sexually transmitted infection screenings based on anatomy due to their comparable or elevated risk for these conditions; and (ii) the need for comprehensive screening for sexually transmitted diseases in men who have sex with men; (iii) appropriate safe sex techniques to avoid the risk for sexually transmitted diseases; and (iv) that individuals who identify as a sexual and/or gender minority (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning individuals) experience intimate partner violence, and how sexual and gender minorities present with intimate partner violence differs from their cisgender, heterosexual peers and may have unique complicating factors. Resolution: 412 (A-23) Page 4 of 4 3. Our AMA will continue to work alongside our partner organizations, including GLMA, to increase physician competency on LGBTQ health issues. 4. Our AMA will continue to explore opportunities to collaborate with other organizations, focusing on issues of mutual concern in order to provide the most comprehensive and up- to-date education and information to enable the provision of high quality and culturally competent care to LGBTQ people.

and 3 4 Whereas, 1 in 3 women and 1 in 4 men in the United States have experienced some form of 5 IPV, with increased rates of injury and rape reported in sexual and ethnic minority 6 populations3,4; and 7 8 Whereas, Up to 61.1% of lesbian and bisexual cisgender women and 37.3% of gay and 9 bisexual cisgender men report experiencing IPV compared to 35% and 29% of heterosexual 10 cisgender women and men, respectively5; and 11 12 Whereas, Transgender individuals disclose instances of physical and sexual IPV at 2.5 and 3.4 13 times more frequently than individuals who do not self -identify with a sexual minority group5; 14 and 15 16 Whereas, National survey data from the Centers for Disease Control state that 53.8% of 17 multiracial women, 46% of American Indian women, and 43.7% of Black women have 18 experienced IPV, compared to 34.6% of non- Hispanic white women6; and 19 20 Whereas, Individuals who experience IPV are also more likely to become victims of other forms 21 of sexual violence and abuse such as stalking, workplace harassment, rape, and trafficking7,8; 22 and 23 24 Whereas, A surge in case numbers of IPV has been recorded, largely due to increased levels 25 of societal stress, panic, and financial and emotional strain resulting from the COVID -19 26 pandemic9; and 27 28 Whereas, IPV has acute effects on physical and mental health, including injury, unintended 29 pregnancy, low fetal birth weight, preterm birth, disorders secondary to trauma, development of 30 substance use disorders, and death by homicide10,11; and 31 32 Whereas, Individuals who experience IPV have a 60% increased risk for asthma, 70% 33 increased risk for heart disease, and 80% increased risk for stroke12; and 34 35 Whereas, The healthcare- related costs due to IPV are estimated to be $104,000 per female 36 victim and $23,000 per male victim, totaling to $5.8 billion annually13,14; and 37 Resolution: 413 (A-23) Page 2 of 8 Whereas, Lifetime economic burden from IPV for all survivors in the U.S. totals nearly $3.6 1 trillion, which includes direct medical costs, lost productivity, the financing of criminal justice 2 proceedings, and replacement of lost or damaged property13; and 3 4 Whereas, Survivors of IPV require sufficient funds to pay for frequent hospital and clinic vi sits, 5 long- term treatment of physical and emotional injuries, mental health conditions, and substance 6 use disorders, legal proceedings, childcare, and finding safety15; and 7 8 Whereas, Job loss in the setting of IPV can propagate the cycle of violence, precipitating 9 further reliance on the abuser for living expenses, childcare, and additional resources3,9,16; and 10 11 Whereas, Close to 60% of IPV survivors report employment instability and job loss due to 12 violence- related reasons, including but not limited to stigma, workplace discrimination due to 13 negative physical and mental effects of IPV, propensity for recurrence of abuse, decreased 14 productivity, and frequent absences3,16; and 15 16 Whereas, 67% of those who have experienced or are experiencing IPV state that interactions 17 with an abusive partner limited their ability to complete education or job training for future 18 career growth, resulting in over 17% leaving the workforce3; and 19 20 Whereas, On average, 83% of IPV survivors experience 7.2 days of lost productivity per month 21 at work, totaling in 8 million days each year, thereby decreasing their chances of earning raises 22 or promotions3,14; and 23 24 Whereas, This loss in productivity and workforce attr ition translates to an annual cost of over 25 $9.3 billion to the United States14; and 26 27 Whereas, 55% of companies do not have, publicize, or provide training for a workplace 28 violence prevention policy offering protections in the event of IPV17; and 29 30 Whereas, 33% of private sector jobs do not offer paid sick leave, and only 13% of jobs have 31 paid family and medical leave18; and 32 33 Whereas, The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 provides only eligible federal workers 34 unpaid leave for medical needs and does not include regulations for private -sector 35 employers19; and 36 37 Whereas, A lack of access to paid leave causes employers and workers to lose $22.5 billion 38 annually in wages and profits20; and 39 40 Whereas, Those who have experienced IPV remain more vulnerable to the detrimental 41 consequences of lost wages from limited opportunities for paid leave, due to inability to afford 42 daily costs of living and medical expenses18,20; and 43 44 Whereas,11 states, including the District of Columbia, have enacted legislation offering \"safe 45 time provisions\" that protect employees who are victims of IPV21,22; and 46 47 Whereas, \"Safe time provisions\" encompass a list of employee rights emerging in the context 48 of experienced violence, including but not limited to safe leave, protection from wrongful 49 termination, and legal assistance stipends in the event of court proceedings21; and 50 Resolution: 413 (A-23) Page 3 of 8 Whereas, Safe leave is defined as a period of paid or unpaid time allotted for physical, mental, 1 and social healing from trauma relating to any form of violence, particularly IPV, stalking, and 2 sexual harassment by non- partners22; and 3 4 Whereas, Violence- related safe leave is distinct from personal medical or family leave in that it 5 includes extended time for ensuring personal and familial safety from threat of abuse, 6 protection from premature or wrongful termination of employment, stipends for legal aid, and 7 connection to social work or supportive agencies that facilitate physical, mental, and social 8 recovery22,23; and 9 10 Whereas, States, districts, and cities that have instituted paid or unpaid safe leave or paid 11 family and medical leave policies inclusive of safe time provisions, including Sonoma, Seattle, 12 New York, and Philadelphia, have not found negative economic effects, subsequent decreases 13 in pay for other employees, or increases in unemployment18,21,22; and 14 15 Whereas, Over $1.1 billion could be saved in emergency department visits through paid safe 16 leave since implementation increases job and financial security of those experiencing IPV while 17 decreasing dependence on the abuser20; and 18 19 Whereas, The implementation of paid safe leave decreased turnover of employees and 20 healthcare costs for preventable conditions, simultaneously improving productivity and 21 economic growth20,24; and 22 23 Whereas, Survivors of IPV who had access to paid leave were better able to connect to family 24 court, had increased job securi ty, and retained greater protection against recurrence of any 25 harassment or abuse by current, former, or non- partners1,25; and 26 27 Whereas, Our AMA has policy (H -515.965) encouraging physicians to campaign against IPV 28 and violence in all forms; and 29 30 Whereas, Though our AMA has individual policies on family, medical, and sick leave ( H- 31 420.979, H -440.823), it lacks policy supportive of providing adequate time for the physical, 32 emotional, and psychiatric healing required following an experience of IPV or non -partner 33 sexual violence; therefore be it 34 35 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association recognize the positive impact of paid safe 36 leave on public health outcomes and support legislation that offers safe leave (New HOD 37 Policy) ; and be it further 38 39 RESOLVED, T hat our AMA amend the existing policy H- 420.979 , \"AMA Statement on Family 40 and Medical Leave to promote inclusivity \" by addition to read as follows: 41 42 AMA Statement on Family and Medical Leave , H-420.979 43 Our AMA supports policies that provide employees with reasonable job security 44 and continued availability of health plan benefits in the event leave by an 45 employee becomes necessary due to documented medical conditions and/or 46 concerns for safety. Such policies should provide for reasonable periods of paid 47 or unpaid: (1) medical leave for the employee, including pregnancy; (2) maternity 48 leave for the employee- mother; (3) leave if medically appropriate to care for a 49 member of the employee's immediate family, i.e., a spouse or children; and (4) 50 leave for adoption or for foster care leading to adoption; and (5) safe leave 51 provisions for those experiencing any instances of violence, including but not 52 Resolution: 413 (A-23) Page 4 of 8 limited to intimate partner violence, sexual violence or coercion, and stalking. 1 Such periods of leave may differ with respect to each of the foregoing 2 classifications, and may vary with reasonable categories of employers.

RELEVANT AMA POLICY Family and Intimate Partner Violence H -515.965 (1) Our AMA believes that all forms of family and intimate partner violence (IPV) are major public health issues and urges the profession, both individually and collectively, to work with other interested parties to prevent such violence and to address the needs of survivors. Physicians have a major role in lessening the prevalence, scope and severity of child maltreatment, intimate partner violence, and elder abuse, all of which fall under the rubric of family violence. To suppor physicians in practice, our AMA will continue to campaign against family violence and remains open to working with all interested parties to address violence in US society. (2) Our AMA believes that all physicians should be trained in issues of family and intimate partner violence through undergraduate and graduate medical education as well as continuing professional development. The AMA, working with state, county and specialty medical societies as well as academic medical centers and other appropriate groups such as the Associati on of American Medical Colleges, should develop and disseminate model curricula on violence for incorporation into undergraduate and graduate medical education, and all parties should work for the rapid distribution and adoption of such curricula. These curricula should include coverage of the diagnosis, treatment, and reporting of child maltreatment, intimate partner violence, and elder abuse and provide training on interviewing techniques, risk assessment, safety planning, and procedures for linking with resources to assist survivors. Our AMA supports the inclusion of questions on family violence issues on licensure and certification tests. (3) The prevalence of family violence is sufficiently high and its ongoing character is such that physicians, particu larly physicians providing primary care, will encounter survivors on a regular basis. Persons in clinical settings are more likely to have experienced intimate partner and family violence than non- clinical populations. Thus, to improve clinical services as well as the public health, our AMA encourages physicians to: (a) Routinely inquire about the family violence histories of their patients as this knowledge is essential for effective diagnosis and care; (b) Upon identifying patients currently experiencing abuse or threats from intimates, assess and discuss safety issues with the patient before he or she leaves the office, working with the patient to develop a safety or exit plan for use in an emergency situation and making appropriate referrals to address i ntervention and safety needs as a matter of course; (c) After diagnosing a violence- related problem, refer patients to appropriate medical or health care professionals and/or community -based trauma- specific resources as soon as possible; (d) Have written l ists of resources available for survivors of violence, providing information on such matters as emergency shelter, medical assistance, mental health services, protective services and legal aid; (e) Screen patients for psychiatric sequelae of violence and m ake appropriate referrals for these conditions upon identifying a history of family or other interpersonal violence; (f) Become aware of local resources and referral sources that have expertise in dealing with trauma from IPV; (g) Be alert to men presentin g with injuries suffered as a result of intimate violence because these men may require intervention as either survivors or abusers themselves; (h) Give due validation to the experience of IPV and of observed symptomatology as possible sequelae; (i) Record a patient's IPV history, observed traumata potentially linked to IPV, and referrals made; (j) Become involved in appropriate local programs designed to prevent violence and its effects at the community level. (4) Within the larger community, our AMA: Resolution: 413 (A-23) Page 6 of 8 (a) Urges hospitals, community mental health agencies, and other helping professions to develop appropriate interventions for all survivors of intimate violence. Such interventions might include individual and group counseling efforts, support groups, and shel ters. (b) Believes it is critically important that programs be available for survivors and perpetrators of intimate violence. (c) Believes that state and county medical societies should convene or join state and local health departments, criminal justice and social service agencies, and local school boards to collaborate in the development and support of violence control and prevention activities. (5) With respect to issues of reporting, our AMA strongly supports mandatory reporting of suspected or actual c hild maltreatment and urges state societies to support legislation mandating physician reporting of elderly abuse in states where such legislation does not currently exist. At the same time, our AMA oppose the adoption of mandatory reporting laws for physi cians treating competent, non- elderly adult survivors of intimate partner violence if the required reports identify survivors. Such laws violate basic tenets of medical ethics. If and where mandatory reporting statutes dealing with competent adults are ado pted, the AMA believes the laws must incorporate provisions that: (a) do not require the inclusion of survivors' identities; (b) allow competent adult survivors to opt out of the reporting system if identifiers are required; (c) provide that reports be made to public health agencies for surveillance purposes only; (d) contain a sunset mechanism; and (e) evaluate the efficacy of those laws. State societies are encouraged to ensure that all mandatory reporting laws contain adequate protections for the reporti ng physician and to educate physicians on the particulars of the laws in their states. (6) Substance abuse and family violence are clearly connected. For this reason, our AMA believes that: (a) Given the association between alcohol and family violence, phy sicians should be alert for the presence of one behavior given a diagnosis of the other. Thus, a physician with patients with alcohol problems should screen for family violence, while physicians with patients presenting with problems of physical or sexual abuse should screen for alcohol use. (b) Physicians should avoid the assumption that if they treat the problem of alcohol or substance use and abuse they also will be treating and possibly preventing family violence. (c) Physicians should be alert to the association, especially among female patients, between current alcohol or drug problems and a history of physical, emotional, or sexual abuse. The association is strong enough to warrant complete screening for past or present physical, emotional, or sexual abuse among patients who present with alcohol or drug problems. (d) Physicians should be informed about the possible pharmacological link between amphetamine use and human violent behavior. The suggestive evidence about barbiturates and amphetamines and violence should be followed up with more research on the possible causal connection between these drugs and violent behavior. (e) The notion that alcohol and controlled drugs cause violent behavior is pervasive among physicians and other health care provider s. Training programs for physicians should be developed that are based on empirical data and sound theoretical formulations about the relationships among alcohol, drug use, and violence. Citation: CSA Rep. 7, I -00; Reaffirmed: CSAPH -09; Modified: CSAPH Rep. 01, A -19; AMA Statement on Family and Medical Leave H -420.979 Our AMA supports policies that provide employees with reasonable job security and continued availability of health plan benefits in the event leave by an employee becomes necessary due to documented medical conditions. Such policies should provide for reasonable periods of paid or unpaid: (1) medical leave for the employee, including pregnancy, abortion, and stillbirth; (2) maternity leave for the employee- mother; (3) leav e if medically appropriate to care for a member of the employee's immediate family, i.e., a spouse or children; and (4) leave for adoption or for foster care leading to adoption. Such periods of leave may differ with respect to each of the foregoing classi fications, and may vary with reasonable categories of employers. Such policies should encourage voluntary programs by employers and may provide for appropriate legislation (with or without financial assistance from government). Any legislative proposals wi ll be reviewed through the Association's normal legislative process for appropriateness, taking into consideration all elements therein, including classifications of employees and employers, reasons for the leave, periods of leave recognized (whether paid or unpaid), obligations on return from leave, and other factors involved in order to achieve reasonable objectives recognizing the legitimate needs of employees and employers.

Citation: CMS Rep. 03, A -16; Reaffirmed: BOT Rep. 11, A -19; Parental Leave H -405.954 1. Our AMA encourages the study of the health implications among patients if the United States were to modify one or more of the following aspects of the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA): a reduction in the number of employees from 50 employees; an increase in the number of covered weeks from 12 weeks; and creating a new benefit of paid parental leave. 2. Our AMA will study the effects of FMLA expansion on physicians in varied practice environments. 3. Our AMA: (a) encourages employers to offer and/or expand paid parental leave policies; (b) encourages state medical associations to work with their state legislatures to est ablish and promote paid parental leave policies; (c) advocates for improved social and economic support for paid family leave to care for newborns, infants and young children; and (d) advocates for federal tax incentives to support early child care and unpaid child care by extended family members. 4. Our AMA: (a) encourages key stakeholders to implement policies and programs that help protect against parental discrimination and promote work -life integration for physician parents, which should encompass prenatal parental care, equal parental leave for birthing and non- birthing parents, and flexibility for childcare; and (b) urges key stakeholders to include physicians and frontline workers in legislation that provides protections and considerations for paid parental leave for issues of health and childcare. Citation: Res. 215, I -16; Appended: BOT Rep. 11, A -19; Appended: Res. 403, A -22; Policies for Parental, Family and Medical Necessity Leave H -405.960 AMA adopts as policy the following guidelines for, and encourages the implementation of, Parental, Family and Medical Necessity Leave for Medical Students and Physicians: 1. Our AMA urges residency training programs, medical specialty boards, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, and medical group practices to incorporate and/or encourage development of leave policies, including parental, family, and medical leave policies, as part of the physician's standard benefit agreement. 2. Recommended components of parental leave policies for physicians include: (a) duration of leave allowed before and after delivery; (b) category of leave credited; (c) whether leave is paid or unpaid; (d) whether provision is made for continuation of insurance benefits during leave, and who pays the premium; (e) whether sick leave and vacation time may be accrued from year to year or used in advance; (f) how much time must be made up in order to be considered board eligible; (g) whether make- up time will be paid; (h) whether schedule accommodations are allowed; and (i) leave policy for adoption. 3. AMA policy is expanded to include physicians in practice, reading as follows: (a) residency program directors and group practice administrators should review federal law concerning maternity leave for guidance in developing policies to assure that pregnant physicians are allowed the same sick leave or disability benefits as those physicians who are ill or disabled; (b) staffing levels and scheduling are encouraged to be flexible enough to allow for coverage without creating intolerable increases in other physicians' workloads, particularly in residency programs; and (c) physicians should be able to return to their practices or training programs after taking parental leave without the loss of status. 4. Our AMA will study the impact on and feasibility of medical schools, residency programs, specialty boards, and medical group practices incorporating into their parental leave policies a 12- week minimum leave allowance, with the understanding that no parent be required to take a mi nimum leave. 5. Our AMA recommends that medical practices, departments and training programs strive to provide 12 weeks of paid parental, family and medical necessity leave in a 12- month period for their attending and trainee physicians as needed. 6. Residency program directors should review federal and state law for guidance in developing policies for parental, family, and medical leave. Resolution: 413 (A-23) Page 8 of 8 7. Medical students and physicians who are unable to work because of pregnancy, childbirth, abortion or stillbirth, and other related medical conditions should be entitled to such leave and other benefits on the same basis as other physicians who are temporarily unable to work for other medical reasons. 8. Residency programs should develop written policies on leave for phys icians. Such written policies should include the following elements: (a) leave policy for birth or adoption; (b) duration of leave allowed before and after delivery; (c) duration of leave allowed after abortion or stillbirth; (d) category of leave credited (e.g., sick, vacation, parental, unpaid leave, short term disability); (e) whether leave is paid or unpaid; (f) whether provision is made for continuation of insurance benefits during leave and who pays for premiums; (g) whether sick leave and vacation ti me may be accrued from year to year or used in advance; (h) extended leave for resident physicians with extraordinary and long- term personal or family medical tragedies for periods of up to one year, without loss of previously accepted residency positions, for devastating conditions such as terminal illness, permanent disability, or complications of pregnancy that threaten maternal or fetal life; (i) how time can be made up in order for a resident physician to be considered board eligible; (j) what period of leave would result in a resident physician being required to complete an extra or delayed year of training; (k) whether time spent in making up a leave will be paid; and (l) whether schedule accommodations are allowed, such as reduced hours, no night cal l, modified rotation schedules, and permanent part -time scheduling. 9. Medical schools should develop written policies on parental leave, family leave, and medical leave for medical students. Such written policies should include the following elements: (a) leave policy for birth or adoption; (b) duration of leave allowed before and after delivery; (c) extended leave for medical students with extraordinary and long -term personal or family medical tragedies, without loss of previously accepted medical school seats, for devastating conditions such as terminal illness, permanent disability, or complications of pregnancy that threaten maternal or fetal life; (d) how time can be made up in order for a medical students to be eligible for graduation with minimal or no delays; (e) what period of leave would result in a medical student being required to complete an extra or delayed year of training; and (f) whether schedule accommodations are allowed, such as modified rotation schedules, no night duties, and flexibilit y with academic testing schedules. 10. Our AMA endorses the concept of equal parental leave for birth and adoption as a benefit for resident physicians, medical students, and physicians in practice regardless of gender or gender identity. 11. Staffing levels and scheduling are encouraged to be flexible enough to allow for coverage without creating intolerable increases in the workloads of other physicians, particularly those in residency programs. 12. Physicians should be able to return to their practices or training programs after taking parental leave, family leave, or medical leave without the loss of status. 13. Residency program directors must assist residents in identifying their specific requirements (for example, the number of months to be made up) because of leave for eligibility for board certification and must notify residents on leave if they are in danger of falling below minimal requirements for board eligibility. Program directors must give these residents a complete list of requirements to be completed in order to retain board eligibility. 14. Our AMA encourages flexibility in residency programs and medical schools incorporating parental leave and alternative schedules for pregnant trainees. 15. In order to accommodate leave protected by the fe deral Family and Medical Leave Act, our AMA encourages all specialties within the American Board of Medical Specialties to allow graduating residents to extend training up to 12 weeks after the traditional residency completion date while still maintaining board eligibility in that year. 16. Our AMA will work with appropriate stakeholders to encourage that residency programs annually publish and share with FREIDA and other appropriate stakeholders, self -identified and other demographic data, including but not limited to the composition of their program over the last 5 years by age; historically marginalized, minoritized, or excluded status; sexual orientation and gender identity. 17. Our AMA will encourage the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Educat ion and other relevant stakeholders to annually collect data on childbirth and parenthood from all accredited US residency programs and publish this data with disaggregation by gender identity and specialty. 18. These policies as above should be freely ava ilable online through FREIDA and in writing to all current trainees and applicants to medical school, residency or fellowship.

and 2 3 Whereas, The San Francisco AIDS Foundation reported in 2017 that less than thirty -five 4 percent of HIV patients experiencing homelessness are considered to be virally suppressed, 5 and an observational study from 2014- 2019 found that in Tennessee, patients who were 6 homeless were half as likely to achieve viral suppression compared to those who had a 7 permanent/stable home2-4; and 8 9 Whereas, According to an interventional study of HIV positive patients, lack of viral suppression 10 in homeless populations leads to a 63% increase in viral load and decreased CD4 count, 11 increased progression to AIDS, and increased HIV -related deaths5; and 12 13 Whereas, According to the Centers for Disease Control, viral suppression through the use of 14 antiretroviral therapy decreases an HIV -positive individual's viral load, improves immune 15 function against HIV, and prevents viral transmission to others through mechanisms such as 16 sexual exposure or sharing of syringes6,7; and 17 18 Whereas, Increased viral suppression can reduce the transmission of HIV by more than 96% 19 while improving immune function and lowering the risk of AIDS - and non -AIDS -defining 20 complications1; and 21 22 Whereas, Longitudinal studies identify lack of housing as a predictor of decreased continuity of 23 treatment among HIV -seropositive patients1,2; and 24 25 Whereas, Lack of stable access to clean water, refrigeration, and proper nutrition can impair 26 adherence to antiretroviral treatments that require daily regimen8,9; and 27 28 Whereas, The AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) provides FDA- approved medications 29 annually to half a million people with HIV who have limited or no health insurance10,11; and 30 31 Whereas, According the ADAP directory, there are only thirty -two AIDS drug assistance 32 program locations nationwide, primarily in densely populated regions12; and 33 34 Whereas, Information about ADAP locations is accessible to the public via an online directory, 35 which may not be easily accessible to people experiencing homelessness due to lack of stable 36 internet access10-12; and 37 Resolution: 414 (A-23) Page 2 of 6 Whereas, Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS (HOPWA) is the only federal program 1 that provides housing opportunities for low income and homeless patients with HIV/AIDS12; and 2 3 Whereas, According to the HOPWA eligibility requirements, HOPWA considers itself a 4 competitive program,14; and 5 6 Whereas, While individuals experiencing homelessness are able to apply for HOPWA grants, 7 the majority of grants are given to city or state governments with priority given to large 8 metropolitan areas14; and 9 10 Whereas, HOPWA's focus on increasing housing in metropolitan areas limits housing 11 opportunities for people experiencing homelessness in rural locations across the nation13,14; and 12 13 Whereas, A 2016- 2017 CDC analysis stated that Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, 14 Missouri, Oklahoma, and South Carolina have higher burdens of HIV cases in counties that are 15 considered rural15; and 16 17 Whereas, Stable housing provides HIV patients with increased access to care and consistency 18 of treatment regimens, increasing the likelihood of achieving viral suppression2,8,11,13; and 19 20 Whereas, Existing AMA policy seeks to combat the HIV epidemic by encouraging the 21 development of educational interventions regarding HIV transmission ( H-20.903), recognizing 22 the need for interventional measures that limit the transmission of HIV (H -20.922), supporting a 23 strategy to increase HIV testing, prophylaxis, and prevention (H -20.896), recognizing the urgent 24 need to reduce the transmission of HIV ( H-20.907) , and supporting increased financial care for 25 HIV patients ( H-20.907), though no such policy exists to specifically address the need for 26 increased access to antiretroviral therapy and stable housing opportunities for people 27 experiencing homelessness; therefore be it 28 29 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association support the development of regul ations 30 and incentives to encourage retention of homeless patients in HIV/AIDS treatment programs 31 (New HOD Policy); and be it further 32 33 RESOLVED, That our AMA recognize that stable housing promotes adherence to HIV treatment 34 (New HOD Policy); and be it further 35 36 RESOLVED, That our AMA amend current policy H- 20.922 , \"HIV/AIDS as a Global Public 37 Health Priority \" by addition and deletion to read as follows: 38 39 HIV/AIDS as a Global Public Health Priority H -20.922 40 In view of the urgent need to curtail the transmission of HIV infection in every 41 segment of the population, our AMA: 42 (1) Strongly urges, as a public health priority, that federal agencies (in 43 cooperation with medical and public health associations and state governments) 44 develop and implement effective programs and strategies for the prevention and 45 control of the HIV/AIDS epidemic; 46 (2) Supports adequate public and private funding for all aspects of the HIV/AIDS 47 epidemic, including research, education, and patient care, and access to stable 48 housing for the full spectrum of the disease. Public and private sector prevention 49 and care efforts should be proportionate to the best available statistics on HIV 50 incidence and prevalence rates; 51 Resolution: 414 (A-23) Page 3 of 6 (3) Will join national and international campaigns for the prevention of HIV 1 disease and care of persons with this disease; 2 (4) Encourages cooperative efforts between state and local health agencies, with 3 involvement of state and local medical societies, in the planning and delivery of 4 state and community efforts directed at HIV testing, counseling, prevention, and 5 care; 6 (5) Encourages community -centered HIV/AIDS prevention planning and 7 programs as essential complements to less targeted media communication 8 efforts; 9 (6) In coordination with appropriate medical specialty societies, supports 10 addressing the special issues of heterosexual HIV infection, the role of 11 intravenous drugs and HIV infection in women, and initiatives to prevent the 12 spread of HIV infection through the exchange of sex for money or goods; 13 (7) Supports working with concerned groups to establish appropriate and uniform 14 policies for neonates, school children, and pregnant adolescents with HIV/AIDS 15 and AIDS -related conditions; 16 (8) Supports increased availability of antiretroviral drugs and drugs to prevent 17 active tuberculosis infection to countries where HIV/AIDS is pandemic; and be it 18 further; and 19 (9) Supports programs raising physician awareness of the benefits of early 20 treatment of HIV and of \"treatment as prevention,\" and the need for linkage of 21 newly HIV -positive persons to clinical care and partner services.

Resolution: 414 (A-23) Page 4 of 6 RELEVANT AMA POLICY HIV/AIDS and Substance Abuse H -20.903 Our AMA: (1) urges federal, state, and local governments to increase funding for drug treatment so that drug abusers have immediate access to appropriate care, regardless of ability to pay. Experts in the field agree that this is the most important step that can be taken to reduce the spread of HIV infection among intravenous drug abusers; (2) advocates development of regulations and incentives to encourage retention of HIV -positive and AIDS -symptomatic patients in drug treatment programs so long as such placement is clinically appropriate; (3) encourages the availability of opioid maintenance for persons addicted to opioids. Federal and state regulations governing opioid maintenance and treatment of drug dependent persons should be reevaluated to determine whether they meet the special needs of intravenous drug abusers, particularly those who are HIV infected or AIDS symptomatic. Federal and state regulations that are based on incomplete or inaccurate scientific and medical data that restrict or inhibit opioid maintenance therapy should be removed; and (4) urges development of educational, medical, and social support programs for intravenous drug abusers and their sexual or needle- sharing partners to reduce risk of HIV infection, as well as risk of other bloodborne and sexually transmissible diseases. Such efforts must target (a) pregnant intravenous drug abusers and those who may become pregnant to address the curr ent and future health care needs of both mothers and newborns and (b) adolescent substance abusers, especially homeless, runaway, and detained adolescents who are seropositive or AIDS symptomatic and those whose lifestyles place them at risk for contracting HIV infection. Citation: (CSA Rep. 4, A -03; Modified: CSAPH Rep. 1, A -13) Eradicating Homelessness H -160.903 Our AMA: (1) supports improving the health outcomes and decreasing the health care costs of treating the chronically homeless through clinically proven, high quality, and cost effective approaches which recognize the positive impact of stable and affordable housing coupled with social services; (2) recognizes that stable, affordable housing as a first priority, without mandated therapy or servic es compliance, is effective in improving housing stability and quality of life among individuals who are chronically -homeless; (3) recognizes adaptive strategies based on regional variations, community characteristics and state and local resources are nec essary to address this societal problem on a long- term basis; (4) supports the use of physician- led, team- based street medicine programs, which travel to individuals who are unhoused or unsheltered and provide healthcare and social services, as well as fu nds, including Medicaid and other public insurance reimbursement, for their maintenance; (5) recognizes the need for an effective, evidence- based national plan to eradicate homelessness; (6) encourages the National Health Care for the Homeless Council to study the funding, implementation, and standardized evaluation of Medical Respite Care for homeless persons; (7) will partner with relevant stakeholders to educate physicians about the unique healthcare and social needs of homeless patients and the impor tance of holistic, cost -effective, evidence- based discharge planning, and physicians' role therein, in addressing these needs; (8) encourages the development of holistic, cost -effective, evidence- based discharge plans for homeless patients who present to the emergency department but are not admitted to the hospital; (9) encourages the collaborative efforts of communities, physicians, hospitals, health systems, insurers, social service organizations, government, and other stakeholders to develop comprehensive homelessness policies and plans that address the healthcare and social needs of homeless patients; (10) (a) supports laws protecting the civil and human rights of individuals experiencing homelessness, and (b) opposes laws and policies that criminali ze individuals experiencing homelessness for carrying out life-sustaining activities conducted in public spaces that would otherwise be considered non- criminal activity (i.e., eating, sitting, or sleeping) when there is no alternative private space availab le; and (11) recognizes that stable, affordable housing is essential to the health of individuals, families, and communities, and supports policies that preserve and expand affordable housing across all neighborhoods; (12) (a) supports training to unders tand the needs of housing insecure individuals for those who encounter this vulnerable population through their professional duties; (b) supports the establishment of multidisciplinary mobile homeless outreach teams trained in issues specific to housing insecure individuals; and (c) will make available existing educational resources from federal agencies and other Resolution: 414 (A-23) Page 5 of 6 stakeholders related to the needs of housing- insecure individuals. (13) encourages medical schools to implement physician- led, team- based Street Medicine programs with student involvement.

Our AMA supports the creation of a National HIV/AIDS strategy, and will work with relevant stakeholders to update and implement the National HIV/AIDS strategy. 2. Our AMA supports and will strongly advocate for the funding of plans to end the HIV epidemic that focus on: (a) diagnosing individuals with HIV infection as early as possible; (b) treating HIV infection to achieve sustained viral suppression; (c) preventing at -risk ind ividuals from acquiring HIV infection, including through the use of pre- exposure prophylaxis; and (d) rapidly detecting and responding to emerging clusters of HIV infection to prevent transmission. Citation: Sub Res. 425, A -09; Modified: CSAPH Rep. 01, A -19; Appended: Res. Financing Care for HIV/AIDS Patients H -20.907 Our AMA: (1) Believes that current private insurance and existing public programs, coupled with a significant expansion of state risk pools, provide the best approach to assuring adequate access to health expense coverage for HIV -infected persons and persons with A IDS. However, as the disease patterns and costs become more defined, it may be necessary to reevaluate this conclusion. Continued study of this issue is imperative; (2) Supports the development of a clinical staging system based on severity of HIV disease as a replacement for the AIDS diagnosis as a basis for determining health, disability, and other benefits; (3) Supports increased funding for reimbursement and other incentives by public and private payers to encourage (a) expanded availability for therapies and interventions widely accepted by physicians as medically appropriate for the prevention and control of HIV disease and (b) for alternatives to in- patient Resolution: 414 (A-23) Page 6 of 6 care of persons with HIV disease, including intermediate care facilities, skilled nursing fac ilities, home care, residential hospice, home hospice, and other support systems; (4) Supports government funding of all medical services that are deemed appropriate by both the patient and physician for pregnant seropositive women lacking other sources of funding; (5) Supports broad improvements in and expansion of the Medicaid program as a means of providing increased coverage and financial protection for low -income AIDS patients; (6) Supports, and favors considering introduction of, legislation to modify the Medicaid program to provide for a yearly dollar increase in the federal share of payments made by states for care of all patients in proportion to the amount of increase in costs incurred by each state program for care of HIV -positive individuals a nd patients with AIDS over the preceding year; (7) Encourages the appropriate state medical societies to seek establishment in their jurisdictions of programs to pay the private insurance premiums from state and federal funds for needy persons with HIV and AIDS; and strongly supports full appropriation of the amounts authorized under the Ryan White CARE Act of 2000; (8) Supports consideration of an award recognition program for physicians who donate a portion of their professional time to testing and counseling HIV -infected patients who could not otherwise afford these services. Citation: (CSA Rep. 4, A -03; Reaffirmation I -11; Reaffirmation I -13) AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 415 (A-23) Introduced by: Medical Student Section Subject: Environmental Health Equity in Federally Subsidized Housing Referred to: Reference Committee D Whereas, In the 1980s, the government passed legislation known as the Comprehensive 1 Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) to assist the 2 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in identifying and remediating the country's most 3 dangerously contaminated sites by setting aside a 'Superfund' of money1; and 4 5 Whereas, The Superfund set aside by CERCLA went bankrupt in 2003 leaving cleanup and 6 remediation projects, with estimated costs of $15 -100 million, to be funded solely through tax 7 revenue2; and 8 9 Whereas, Supreme Court rulings starting in 2008 with Burlington Northern v. the United 10 States have severely reduced the financial liability of polluters, stalling funding for the 11 Superfund program2; and 12 13 Whereas, CERCLA defines hazardous substances as elements and compounds which 14 present an imminent and substantial danger to the public health and welfare of living 15 creatur es and waterfronts1; and 16 17 Whereas, Hazardous substances defined by CERCLA include but are not limited to lead, 18 hexavalent chromium, radium, and polychlorinated biphenyl chemicals (PCBs), are known 19 hazards to human health, causing intellectual and behavioral delays, anemia, lung disease, 20 inflammatory diseases, cancers, adverse effects on fertility, and prenatal development3-6; and 21 22 Whereas, The geographic areas identified through CERCLA contaminated with known 23 hazardous substances are commonly referred to as Superfund sites1; and 24 25 Whereas, As of 2020, 73 million people (22% of the US population) lives within 3 miles of a 26 Superfund site7; and 27 28 Whereas, Proximity to environmental hazards increases the risk for lifelong chronic mental 29 and physical illnesses, including but not limited to cancer, congenital disabilities, and 30 developmental disabilities9; and 31 32 Whereas, In Texas, East Houston's Fifth Ward, a community with proximity to three 33 Superfund sites, there is a pediatric and adult cancer cluster with 43 percent of households 34 reporting a cancer diagnosis10; and 35 36 Whereas, According to an evaluation performed by the Office of Inspector General in 2019, 37 18,158 properties owned, subsidized, or managed by the Department of Housing and Urban 38 Development (HUD) are located within one mile of Superfund sites11; and 39 Resolution: 415 (A-23) Page 2 of 8 Whereas, The majority of people living in federally subsidized housing belong to racial and 1 ethnic minority groups, subjecting these groups to a disproportionate amount of 2 environmental hazards exposure leading to inequitable health outcomes8; and 3 4 Whereas, Neither the EPA, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, states, 5 cities, nor realtors are obligated to disclose proximity to Superfund sites upon purchase or 6 lease agreement leaving citizens unaware of the health hazards they and their children face 7 until they are grappling with long- term consequences12; and 8 9 Whereas, Those who rent their home are significantly less likely than homeowners to know 10 that they live in close proximity to Superfund sites13; and 11 12 Whereas, There is often a disconnect between environmental protection organizations and 13 community members near superfund sites, with residents of nearby communities often 14 lacking adequate knowledge to assess the environmental hazards around them14; and 15 16 Whereas, A potential strategy for mitigating the lack of community knowledge of 17 environmental exposures is to put communication processes in place to anticipate the 18 potential for disconnect and seek regular feedback from community memb ers14; and 19 20 Whereas, The Residential Lead- Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 establishes 21 guidelines to \"educate the public concerning the hazards and sources of lead- based paint 22 poisoning and steps to reduce and eliminate such hazards\", demonstratin g that the 23 precedent for hazardous substance disclosure has already been established15; and 24 25 Whereas, The disclosures described in the Residential Lead- Based Paint Hazard Reduction 26 Act of 1992, which include the explicit disclosure of lead- based paint in the property, a 27 warning statement signed by both purchaser and seller, and a lead hazard information 28 packet, do not extend to other environmental hazards which may be present at each site15; 29 and 30 31 Whereas, The \"right to know\" principle applied to public health ethics allows for individual 32 autonomy in decision making with respect to awareness of environmental hazard exposure16; 33 and 34 35 Whereas, Disclosure of known environmental health risks would promote informed decision- 36 making supporting individual autonomy16; and 37 38 Whereas, Environmental health- related care includes but is not limited to blood hazardous 39 substance screening, fertility, and prenatal testing, pediatric cognitive and behavioral delays 40 screening, and prescriptions for heavy metal chelating drugs3-5,9; and 41 42 Whereas, Planning and execution of a Superfund site cleanup may take years to decades as 43 evidenced by the over 1,800 Superfund sites, as of January 4, 2022, that have been marked 44 for clean- up for decades without completed remediation12,17; and 45 46 Wher eas, Communities residing on or near Superfund sites may have to wait years even 47 after a clean- up project has been initiated for the toxin levels in their environment to reach 48 levels acceptable for residential use17; and 49 Resolution: 415 (A-23) Page 3 of 8 Whereas, Although the EPA and community organizations work to remediate the Superfund 1 sites fully, the EPA admits some sites may never reach environmental toxin levels safe for 2 residential use18; and 3 4 Whereas, Under CERCLA, the EPA maintains the right to establish Alternate Concentration 5 Limits (CLs) for use in Superfund cleanups that may fall below the standards of widely used 6 pollutant limits18; and 7 8 Whereas, The EPA maintains the right to waive violations of other state and federal 9 regulations on toxin levels due to \"technical infeasibility\" in order to approve a Superfund 10 cleanup18; and 11 12 Whereas, The current HUD -EPA agreement only requests yearly status reports on 13 contaminant levels and environmental indicators at active Superfund sites, subject to the 14 availability of the agency's funding and manpower, and EPA guidelines suggest no follow -up 15 or follow -up monitoring only every five years at deleted Superfund sites12,19; and 16 17 Whereas, Environmental justice is defined as the principle that all people and communities 18 regardless of race, color, national origin, or income, are entitled to equal protection by 19 environmental and public health laws and regulations, while environmental injustice 20 describes environmental laws, regulations and policies that overly affect a group of people 21 resultin g in greater exposure to environmental hazards20; and 22 23 Whereas, Environmental racism refers to a type of environmental injustice in which the racial 24 and ethnic contexts of environmental regulations and policies, exposures, support structures, 25 and health outcomes cause inequitable environmental hazards for some racial groups21,22; 26 and 27 28 Whereas, Low -income and minoritized communities are burdened by environmental injustice 29 in that they reside in areas with higher environmental exposures, reduced preventive 30 measures, and limited medical intervention, further exacerbating health outcome disparities23-31 27; and 32 33 Whereas, The enactment of exclusionary housing policies, including zoning ordinances, 34 restrictive covenants, blockbusting, steering, and redlining, purposefully created racial 35 segregation, exposed Black communities to environmental pollutants and targeting for 36 construction of toxin- releasing facilities, isolated them from essential health resources such 37 as healthy food options, hospitals, and green spaces, and permitted health inequities to 38 concentrate in disadvantaged low -income neighborhoods28-32; and 39 40 Whereas, The environmental justice and fair housing collaboration between the 41 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Department of Housing and U rban 42 Development (HUD) remains inadequate due to insufficient action to provide non- 43 discriminatory and affordable housing units in locations without risk of environmental health 44 exposures33; and 45 46 Whereas, A combination of inequitable land- use policies, l ack of environmental regulation 47 and enforcement, and market forces in petrochemical and heavy metal industries have 48 contributed to the perpetuation of poverty and worse health outcomes in minoritized 49 populations34; and 50 Resolution: 415 (A-23) Page 4 of 8 Whereas, Proximity to and exposure to hazards from the oil and gas, plastics, animal 1 production, chemical manufacturing, endocrine- disrupting chemicals, and metal industries 2 have been strongly linked to at least one of the following: neural tube defects, preterm birth, 3 low-birth weight, diffuse interstitial lung fibrosis, chronic bronchitis, asthma exacerbation, 4 diabetes, hypertension secondary to chronic inflammation, pneumonia, reduced child 5 cognition from heavy metal exposure, neurologic diseases, cancers, hyperlipidemia, and 6 thyroid diseas e35-44; and 7 8 Whereas, Closures of industrial sites and reductions in pollution have been linked to 9 improved fertility and reduced preterm births and respiratory hospitalizations45-47; and 10 11 Whereas, The health of American Indian tribes depends on essential natural resources that 12 have either been depleted and/or contaminated by mining and oil corporations, leading to 13 adverse health outcomes48-51; and 14 15 Whereas, Government agencies have failed to act on current policy and integrate current 16 environmental science research or expertise into ongoing environmental regulations and 17 public health initiatives, resulting in continued and amplified environmental hazards and 18 failing to protect people, especially in Black and American Indian communities, from known 19 and predictable environmental health dangers52-59; and 20 21 Whereas, Our AMA policy H -135.996 addresses the existence of environmental pollution and 22 supports research into its threat to human health; and 23 24 Whereas, Our AMA policy H- 135.996 supports efforts to alert the American people to the 25 dangers of general environmental pollution, however, it does not go far enough to ask for 26 mandated disclosure to residents in known areas of environmental risk; and 27 28 Whereas, Our AMA policy H- 135.996 does not directly address the need for expansion of 29 federally funded health insurance coverage of services to specifically address the health risk 30 associated with residing in or near polluted environments; and 31 32 Whereas, Our AMA recognizes that racism, in all its forms, is an urgent public health threat, 33 and has pledged to work to combat the adverse health effects of racism (H -65.952); therefore 34 be it 35 36 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association acknowledge the potential adverse 37 health impacts of living in close proximity to a Superfund site (New HOD Policy) ; and be it 38 further 39 40 RESOLVED, That our AMA advocate for mandated disclosure of Superfund site proximity to 41 those purchasing, leasing, or currently residing in housing in close proximity to Superfund 42 sites (Directive to Take Action); and be it further 43 44 RESOLVED, That our AMA support efforts of public agencies to study the safety of proposed 45 public housing expansions with respect to pollutant exposure and to expand construction of 46 new public and publicly subsidized housing properties on lands without demonstrated unsafe 47 levels of hazardous pollutants (New HOD Policy) ; and be it further 48 Resolution: 415 (A-23) Page 5 of 8 RESOLVED, That our AMA amend Policy D -135.997, \"Research into the Environmental 1 Contributors to Disease,\" by addition and deletion to read as follows: 2 3 D-135.997 - RESEARCH INTO THE ENVIRONM ENTAL 4 CONTRIBUTORS TO DISEASE AND ADVOCATING FOR 5 ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE 6 Our AMA will (1) advocate for the greater public and private funding for 7 r esearch into the environment causes of disease, and urge the National 8 Academy of Sciences to undert ake an authoritative analysis of 9 environmental causes of disease; (2) ask the steering committee of the 10 Medicine and Public Health Initiative Coalition to consider environmental 11 contributors to disease and environmental racism as a priority public 12 health i ssues; (3) encourage federal, state, and local agencies to address 13 and remediate environmental injustice, environmental racism, and all 14 other environmental conditions that are adversely impacting health, 15 especially in marginalized communities; and ( 34) lobby Congress to 16 support ongoing initiatives that include reproductive health outcomes and 17 development particularly in minority populations in Environmental 18 Protection Agency Environmental Justice policies.

Our AMA acknowledges that, although the primary drivers of racial health inequity are systemic and structural racism, racism and unconscious bias within medical r esearch and health care delivery have caused and continue to cause harm to marginalized communities and society as a whole. 2. Our AMA recognizes racism, in its systemic, cultural, interpersonal, and other forms, as a serious threat to public health, to t he advancement of health equity, and a barrier to appropriate medical care. Resolution: 415 (A-23) Page 8 of 8 3. Our AMA encourages the development, implementation, and evaluation of undergraduate, graduate, and continuing medical education programs and curricula that engender greater understanding of: (a) the causes, influences, and effects of systemic, cultural, institutional, and interpersonal racism; and (b) how to prevent and ameliorate the health effects of racism. 4. Our AMA: (a) supports the development of policy to combat racism and its effects; and (b) encourages governmental agencies and nongovernmental organizations to increase funding for research into the epidemiology of risks and damages related to racism and how to prevent or repair them. 5. Our AMA will work to prevent an d combat the influences of racism and bias in innovative health technologies. Citation: Res. 5, I -20; Reaffirmed: Res. 013, A -22; Modified: Speakers Rep., A -22; AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 416 (A-23) Introduced by: Medical Student Section Subject: New Policies to Respond to the Gun Violence Public Health Crisis Referred to: Reference Committee D Whereas, Gun violence is a major public health crisis in the United States with the Centers 1 for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) most recently reporting 45,222 gun- related deaths 2 in 2020\u2014a 14% increase from 2019, and the most on record at the time and1-3; and 3 4 Whereas, The CDC reported that gun -related injuries were one of the five leading causes of 5 death for people aged 1 to 44 in the U.S. in 20203-4; and 6 7 Whereas, A May 2022 letter in The New England Journal of Medicine based on 2020 CDC 8 data suggests that gun-related injuries have surpassed motor vehicle crashes to now 9 become the leading cause of death for children and young adults aged 1 to 193-4; and 10 11 Whereas, According to 2020 CDC data, over 40% of gun- related deaths were homicides 12 (19,384 deaths, or 79% of all homicides) and over 50% of gun deaths were suicides (24,292 13 deaths, or 53% of all suicides), accounting for 124 deaths a day3; and 14 15 Whereas, The Gun Violence Archive, an independent data research group that tracks gun - 16 related incidents and defines a mass shooting using a statistical threshold as an event where 17 four or more people are shot, reported 692 mass shootings in 2021 and 610 in 20205-6; and 18 19 Whereas, The Gun Violence Archive reported that 246 mass shootings took place in the first 20 five months of 20226; and 21 22 Whereas, On May 24, 2022, 21 children and teachers were killed and 18 injured at Robb 23 Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, the second deadliest school shooting on record, ten 24 years after 26 students and educators were killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting7; 25 and 26 27 Whereas, On June 1, 2022, two physicians, a patient, and another healthcare worker were 28 killed and several injured in a mass shooting at the St. Francis Hospital in Tulsa, Oklahoma8; 29 and 30 31 Whereas, Advocacy to address the gun violence public health crisis is crucial to support the 32 AMA's goals of promoting racial justice and health equity, as CDC data shows that Black, 33 American Indian and Alaska Native, and Hispanic people are disproportionately affected by 34 gun homicides compared to white individuals9; and 35 36 Whereas, Multiple countries, including the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Norway, and 37 Australia, quickly introduced and have adopted successful national legislation to ban semi - 38 automatic and automatic weapons after just a single mass shooting10; and 39 Resolution: 416 (A-23) Page 2 of 10 Whereas, Approximately 20- 25% of all handguns recovered at crime scenes were originally 1 purchased as part of a multiple sale, which is the purchase of more than one gun within 5 2 business days11; and 3 4 Whereas, Handguns sold in multiple sales are up to 64% more likely to be used in crime 5 scenes than handguns sold individually12; and 6 7 Whereas, Many jurisdictions do not require background checks for the purchase of 8 ammunition; however, research predicts that background checks for ammunition purchases 9 would cut gun -related death rates by 81%13; and 10 11 Whereas, Waiting period laws that delay the purchase of firearms by a few days reduce gun 12 homicides by roughly 17%14;and 13 14 Whereas, States have different firearm inheritance laws where it may be easier in some 15 states for individuals to obtain a firearm, such as some states require the firearm to be 16 regist ered while other states don't require a permit to own a firearm15,16; and 17 18 Whereas, In 2020, our AMA announced a partnership with West Side United to invest $6 19 million in community infrastructure programs in Chicago's west side neighborhoods to 20 address issues relating to health inequities and economic vitality based on community needs, 21 including affordable housing, access to healthy foods, financing local business projects, and 22 supporting job creation efforts and educational programs17; and 23 24 Whereas, In the wake of the Pulse Orlando mass shooting in 2016, our AMA declared gun 25 violence as a public health crisis \"requiring a comprehensive public health response and 26 solution\" yet the number of gun deaths have only continued to rise (D -145.995)18; and 27 28 Whereas, Our AMA has adopted numerous policies to reduce gun trauma, injury and death, 29 including H -145.996, H -145.975, H -145.997, D -145.996, H -145.999, H -515.971, and 31 145.001MSS, but as this crisis continues to escalate, further advocacy is needed; therefore 32 be it 33 34 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association advocate for federal and state policies 35 that prevent inheritance, gifting, or transfer of ownership of firearms without adhering to all 36 federal and state requirements for background checks, waiting periods, and licensure 37 (Directive to Take Action) ; and be it further 38 39 RESOLVED, That our AMA advocate for federal and state policies to prevent \"multiple sales\" 40 of firearms, def ined as the sale of multiple firearms to the same purchaser within five 41 business days (Directive to Take Action); and be it further 42 43 RESOLVED, That our AMA advocate for federal and state policies implementing background 44 checks for ammunition purchases.

Our AMA recogniz es that uncontrolled ownership and use of firearms, especially handguns, is a serious threat to the public's health inasmuch as the weapons are one of the main causes of intentional and unintentional injuries and deaths. Therefore, the AMA: (A) encourages and endorses the development and presentation of safety education programs that will engender more responsible use and storage of firearms; (B) urges that government agencies, the CDC in particular, enlarge their efforts in the study of firearm- related inj uries and in the development of ways and means of reducing such injuries and deaths; (C) urges Congress to enact needed legislation to regulate more effectively the importation and interstate traffic of all handguns; (D) urges the Congress to support recent legislative efforts to ban the manufacture and importation of nonmetallic, not readily detectable weapons, which also resemble toy guns; (5) encourages the improvement or modification of firearms so as to make them as safe as humanly possible; (E) encour ages nongovernmental organizations to develop and test new, less hazardous designs for firearms; (F) urges that a significant portion of any funds recovered from firearms manufacturers and dealers through legal proceedings be used for gun safety education and gun- violence prevention; and (G) strongly urges US legislators to fund further research into the epidemiology of risks related to gun violence on a national level. 2. Our AMA will advocate for firearm safety features, including but not limited to mechanical or smart technology, to reduce accidental discharge of a firearm or misappropriation of the weapon by a non- registered user; and support legislation and regulation to standardize the use of these firearm safety features on weapons sold for non- milita ry and non- peace officer use within the U.S.; with the aim of establishing manufacturer liability for the absence of safety features on newly manufactured firearms. 3. Our AMA will support research examining the major sources of illegally possessed firearms, as well as possible methods of decreasing their proliferation in the United States. 4. Our AMA will work with key stakeholders including, but not limited to, firearm manufacturers, firearm advocacy groups, law enforcement agencies, public health agencies, firearm injury victims advocacy groups, healthcare providers, and state and federal government agencies to develop evidence- informed public health recommendations to mitigate the effects of violence committed with firearms. 5. Our AMA will collaborate w ith key stakeholders and advocate for national public forums including, but not limited to, online venues, national radio, and televised/streamed in- person town halls, that bring together key stakeholders and members of the general public to focus on findi ng common ground, non- partisan measures to mitigate the effects of firearms in our firearm injury public health crisis.

The policy of the AMA is to encourage hospitals to incorporate, within their security policies, specific provisions on the presence of firearms in the hospital. The AMA believes the following points merit attention: A. Given that security needs stem from local conditions, firearm policies must be developed with the cooperation and collaboration of the medical staff, the hospital security staff, the hospital administration, other hospital staff representatives, legal counsel, and local law enforcement officials. Consultation with outside experts, including state and federal law enfor cement agencies, or patient advocates may be warranted. B. The development of these policies should begin with a careful needs assessment that addresses past issues as well as future needs. C. Policies should, at minimum, address the following issues: a means of identification for all staff and visitors; restrictions on access to the hospital or units within the hospital, including the means of ingress and egress; changes in the physical layout of the facility that would improve security; the possible use of metal detectors; the use of monitoring equipment such as closed circuit television; the development of an emergency signaling system; signage for the facility regarding the possession of weapons; procedures to be followed when a weapon is discovered; and the means for securing or controlling weapons that may be brought into the facility, particularly those considered contraband but also those carried in by law enforcement personnel. D. Once policies are developed, training should be provided to all member s of the staff, with the level and type of training being related to the perceived risks of various units within the facility. Training to recognize and defuse potentially violent situations should be included. E. Policies should undergo periodic reassessment and evaluation. F. Firearm policies should incorporate a clear protocol for situations in which weapons are brought into the hospital. 2. Our AMA will advocate that hospitals and other healthcare delivery settings limit guns and conducted electrical we apons in units where patients suffering from mental illness are present. 3. Our AMA will: (a) advocate that physicians not be required to carry or use weapons in correctional facilities where they provide clinical care; and (b) work with appropriate stakeholders to make evidence- based recommendations regarding the presence of weapons in correctional healthcare facilities.

and 2 3 Whereas, Laypersons witness 38.3% of cardiac arrest episodes that occur outside of the 4 hospital, and therefore they play a critical role in helping first responders address a cardiac 5 arrest1; and 6 7 Whereas, Patients receiving an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) shock prior to 8 emergency medical service arrival resulted in 38% survival versus 9% survival in those who 9 only received cardiopulmonary resuscitation2; and 10 11 Whereas, When dispatchers instruct a bystander to locate an AED that is nearby, they are 12 seldom within obvious view, which can severely limit the application of the AED3; and 13 14 Whereas, The lack of AED accessibility is known as a major contributing factor to worse 15 health outcomes and is a barrier to increasing survival for out -of-hospital cardiac arrests 16 (OHCA)4; and 17 18 Whereas, One study in Howard County, Maryland reported a weak correlation between AED 19 location and witnessed OHCA sites, indicating that AEDs were not registered at sites with the 20 most OHCA occurrences5; and 21 22 Whereas, A study in Phoenix, Arizona found a weak correlation between sites where 23 incidents of OHCA took place and the number of AEDs available6; and 24 25 Whereas, AED -related disparate health outcomes present disproportionately in Black 26 neighborhoods, as shown by the fact that there was a positive correlation between cardiac 27 arrests in AED -unavailable public locations with higher numbers of Black residents7; and 28 29 Whereas, Black men and women in America have an incidence of out -of-hospital sudden 30 cardiac death at 2.8% and 2.3% compared to their White counterparts at 1.4% and 0.7%, 31 respectively8; and 32 33 Whereas, Currently our American Medical Association advocat es for the widespread 34 placement of AED devices (H -130.938 ), but does not reference doing so in a targeted and 35 equitable manner that is necessary to speak to existing issues and disparities that a 36 generalized widespread distribution does not address; and 37 38 Whereas, Methodologies that take into account spatial and temporal data are needed to 39 determine placement of AEDs in areas that suffer from increased frequency of OHCA9; and 40 Resolution: 418 (A-23) Page 2 of 4 Whereas, Targeted placement of AEDs in areas with a high likelihood of sudden cardi ac 1 arrest events has been shown to be cost effective, decreas e time to defibrillation, and 2 increas e odds of survival10-11; and 3 4 Whereas, Optimizing the placement of AEDs in the public resulted in increased coverage of 5 OHCA in areas with greater disparities similarly to the way that doubling the amount of AEDs 6 would have done12; and 7 8 Whereas, Studies that utilized computational approaches to targeted placement of AEDs 9 provided an additional modality that confirms the optimization of AED access, improves 10 cove rage and usage of AED devices, as well as increases survival in OHCA episodes13-14; 11 therefore be it 12 13 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association amend Policy H -130.938, 14 \"Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and Defibrillators, \" by addition to read as f ollows: 15 16 Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and Defibrillators H -130.938 17 Our AMA: 18 (1) supports publicizing the importance of teaching CPR, including the 19 use of automated external defibrillation; 20 (2) strongly recommends the incorporation of CPR classes as a voluntary 21 part of secondary school programs; 22 (3) encourages the American public to become trained in CPR and the 23 use of automated external defibrillators; 24 (4) advocates the widespread placement of automated external 25 defibrillators, including on all grade K -12 school campuses and locations 26 at which school events are held; 27 (5) encourages all grade K -12 schools to develop an emergency action 28 plan for sudden cardiac events; 29 (6) supports increasing government and industry funding for the purchase 30 of automated external defibrillator devices; 31 (7) endorses increased funding for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and 32 defibrillation training of community organization and school personnel; 33 (8) supports the development and use of universal connectivit y for all 34 defibrillators; 35 (9) supports legislation that would encourage high school students be 36 trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and automated 37 external defibrillator use; 38 (10) will update its policy on cardiopulmonary resuscitation and 39 automated external defibrillators (AEDs) by endorsing efforts to promote 40 the importance of AED use and public awareness of AED locations, by 41 using solutions such as integrating AED sites into widely accessible 42 mobile maps and applications; 43 (11) urges AED vendors to remove labeling from AED stations that 44 stipulate that only trained medical professionals can use the defibrillators; 45 and 46 (12) supports consistent and uniform legislation across states for the legal 47 protection of those who use AEDs in the course of attempting to aid a 48 sudden cardiac arrest victim; and. 49 Resolution: 418 (A-23) Page 3 of 4 (13) encourages the distribution of Automated External Defibrillators in an 1 equitable manner through the utilization of targeted placement strategies 2 in order to increase availability and decrease disparities in areas where 3 disproportionate rates of out -of-hospital cardiac arrest episodes exist. 4 (Modify Current HOD Policy) 5 6 Fiscal Note: Minimal - less than $1,000 Received: 4/3 /23 REFERENCES 1.

AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES R esolution: 423 (A-23) Vermont S ubject: Reducing Sodium Intake to Improve Public Health R eferred to: Reference Committee D W hereas , Sodium is an essential nutrient necessary for maintenance of health and whole- body 1 function and excess sodium is linked to adverse health outcomes, including increased blood 2 pressure. The primary contributors to dietary sodium consumption depend on the cultural 3 context and dietary habits of a population. Nine out of 10 U.S. men and women will develop 4 hypertension at some point in their lives1; and 5 6 Whereas , The main source of sodium in our diet is salt, sodium can be found naturally in foods 7 such as milk, meat, and shellfish as well as in common condiments, such as soy sauce and 8 sodium glutamate. Sodium is often found in high amounts in processed foods. Thes e foods are 9 often more affordable and available to the general public resulting in higher consumption of 10 sodium ; and 11 12 Whereas , On average people consume 9- 12 grams of salt per day, or around twice the 13 recommended maximum level of intake. Salt intake of less than 5 grams per day for adults 14 helps to reduce blood pressure and risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and coronary heart 15 attack. The principal benefit of lowering salt intake is a corresponding reduction in high blood 16 pressure. Researchers estimate that reducing the average daily sodium intake in the U.S. to 17 2,300 milligrams (about 1 teaspoon of salt) per day would prevent 11 million cases of 18 hypertension and would save $18 billion in health care costs each year3. An estimated 2.5 19 million deaths could be prevented each year if global salt consumption were reduced to the 20 recommended level; and 21 22 Whereas , World Health Organization (WHO) Member States have agreed to reduce the global 23 population's intake of salt by a relative 30% by 2025. Reducing salt intake has been identified 24 as one of the most cost -effective measures countries can take to improve population health 25 outcomes. Key salt reduction measures will generate an extra year of healthy life for a cost that 26 falls below the average annual income or gross domestic product per person; and 27 28 Whereas , The U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) released new voluntary guidance on 29 October 13, 2021, encouraging the food industry to gradually reduce sodium in commercially 30 processed, packaged, and prepared foods over the next two and a half years \u2014with the aim of 31 helping Americans reduce their average levels of sodium from 3,400 to 3,000 mg/day ; and 32 33 Whereas , In 2013, the World Health Assembly (WHA) agreed to global voluntary prevention 34 targets including a relative reduction in the intake of salt by 2025. The \"Global Action Plan for 35 the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases 2013- 2020\" gives guidance and a 36 menu of policy options for Member States, WHO and other UN agencies to achieve the targets ; 37 and 38 Resolution: 423 (A-23) Page 2 of 2 Whereas , Some manufacturers have voluntarily agreed to cut back on sodium as part of New 1 York City's National Salt Reduction Initiative6. The aim of this initiative is to guide a voluntary 2 reduction of salt levels in packaged and restaurant foods, with the primary goal of cutting the 3 salt in packaged and restaurant foods by 25% over f ive years - which would reduce the nation's 4 salt intake by 20% and prevent thousands of deaths ; and 5 6 Whereas , Finland and the United Kingdom have led successful sodium reduction efforts. In 7 Finland, a government -led program of education, salt -labeling legi slation, and pressure on the 8 food industry has led to a 30 percent reduction in salt intake, from 12,000 milligrams a day to 9 around 9,000 milligrams today7; therefore be it 10 11 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association work with all relevant stakeholders to 12 advocate and advise salt reduction through public outreach that may include, but not be limited 13 to, policy changes, ad campaigns, educational programs, including those starting in schools, 14 and food labeling (Directiv e to Take Action) ; and be it further 15 16 RESOLVED, That our AMA study and report back at the 2024 Annual Meeting the effectiveness 17 and feasibility of salt reduction strategies with specific interventions such as: 18 19 1. Consumer awareness and empowerment of populat ions through social marketing and 20 mobilization to raise awareness of salt alternatives and the need to reduce salt intake 21 2. Government policies, including appropriate fiscal policies and regulation, to ensure food 22 manufacturers produce healthier affordable l ow-sodium foods and retailers make such 23 products available 24 3. Integrating salt reduction strategies and alternatives into the training curriculum of food 25 handlers 26 4. Removing opportunistic use of saltshakers 27 5.

Such periods of leave may differ with respect to each of the foregoing classifications, and may vary with reasonable categories of employers. Such policies should encourage voluntary programs by employers and may provide for appropriate legislation (with or without financial assistance from government). Any legislative proposals will be reviewed through the Association's normal legislative process for appropriateness, taking into consideration all elements therein, including classif ications of employees and employers, reasons for the leave, periods of leave recognized (whether paid or unpaid), obligations on return from leave, and other factors involved in order to achieve reasonable objectives recognizing the legitimate needs of emp loyees and employers.

REPORT OF THE COUNCIL ON SCIENCE AND PUBLIC HEALTH CSAPH Report 01- A-23 Subject: Oppose Scheduling of Gabapentin Presented by: Noel Deep, MD, Chair Referred to: Reference Committee E American M edical A ssociation (AMA) Policy D -120.927, \"Oppose Scheduling of Gabapentin ,\" 1 calls for the study of off -label use and potential risks and benefits of gabapentin to the general 2 population as well as to those individuals with substance use disorders. This report investigates the 3 evidence base for off -label prescribing of gabapentin, the regulatory landscape of gabapentin for 4 maximizing patient access and minimizing stigma , and adverse events during the ongoing overdose 5 crisis. 6 7 BACKGROUND 8 9 In February 2022, the U.S. Food and Drug Administ ration (FDA) received a petition from a 10 consumer advocacy group requesting that gabapentin and gabapentin enacarbil be designated as 11 schedule V under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. In June 2022, Resolution 514- A-22 (now 12 policy D -120.927) was adopte d by the House of Delegates which called upon the AMA to oppose 13 this petition and any other efforts to schedule gabapentin and its salts pending review of the risk 14 and benefits of gabapentin use in the general public and those with substance use disorders. 15 16 METHODS 17 18 English language articles w ere selected from searches of PubMed , Cochrane Library and Google 19 Scholar using the search terms \"gabapentin OR neurontin\", \"gabapentin AND off -label\", 20 \"gabapentin AND substance\", AND substance use disorder\" and 21 \"gabapentin AND opioids\". Additional articles w ere identified by manual review of the reference 22 lists of pertinent publications. Web sites managed by government agencies and applicable 23 organizations w ere also reviewed for relevant informa tion. 24 25 DISCUSSION 26 27 History of Gabapentin 28 29 Gabapentin, a gabapentinoid originally marketed under the trade name Neurontin by Parke -Davis, 30 is an analog of the neurotransmitter gamma -aminobutryic acid. While the exact mechanism of 31 action for gabapentin is not known, it is generally accepted that it binds to the 2 subunit of 32 calcium -activated ion channels. 1 It is hypothesized that this then further modulates neurotransmitter 33 release, which may affect the dopaminergic pathways associated with reward -seeking behavior and 34 substance use disorders. 35 36 Neurontin (gabapentin) was init ially approved by the FDA in 1993 for adjunctive therapy of partial 37 onset seizures in patients aged 12 or older.2 In 2000, that indication was expanded by the FDA for 38 CSAPH Rep. 01- A-23 -- page 2 of 11 pediatric patients over the age of three . In 2002, a second indication for post -herpetic neuralgia was 1 approved by the FDA . It is currently available as a generic medication. Despite the relatively 2 narrow scope of approved indications, Neurontin (gabapentin) was marketed by its manufacturer, 3 Parke -Davis, for a variety of off-label indications such as neuropathic pain, epilepsy monotherapy, 4 bipolar disorder, migraine, and attention- deficit disorder , due to data which showed improved 5 outcomes in these disease states.3 It was estimated that prior to generic competition becoming 6 available in 2004, Neurontin (gabapentin) products were grossing over $3 billion a year in sales. 7 8 To maximize market penetration, Parke -Davis was accused of pursuing illegal strategies like the 9 ethically dubious quid pro quo solicitation of ghost -written, pro -Neurontin editorials .4 As a result, 10 Parke -Davis's parent organization Warner -Lambert (and ultimately Pfizer, after it acquired the 11 company in 2000) plead ed guilty to two counts of violating the Food, Drug & Cosmetics Act and 12 was required to pay $430 m illion in both civil and criminal damages.5 A separate lawsuit for these 13 marketing practice s from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana, was settled for $325 million, and a 14 third lawsuit regarding anti -trust activity to prevent generic gabapentin off the ma rket, was settled 15 in 2014 for $190 million.6 Pfizer did not admit wrongdoing in the latter two settlements. 16 17 It is critical to understand the history of Neurontin advertising when assessing the perception of 18 off-label prescribing of gabapentin. A portion of off- label gabapentin prescriptions could be due to 19 misleading marketing information. However, it should be noted that these were unethical and 20 illegal business practices , and should be viewed separate ly from issues of safety, efficacy, or 21 overall utili ty in patient care. 22 23 Gabapentin and its salts are FDA -approved to treat postherpetic neuralgia and adjunctive treatment 24 of epilepsy with partial onset seizures, yet one study found that up to 95 percent of gabapentin 25 prescriptions were for off -label uses such as fibromyalgia, bipolar affective disorder , and alcohol 26 use disorder.7 Another study found that amongst 160 commonly prescribed drugs, gabapentin had 27 the highest off -label prescription rate, and that 80 percent of the time, its off -label usage had little - 28 to-no scientific support.8 As of a 2020 survey, seven states have made gabapentin a schedule V 29 controlled substance, and 13 states have added it to their prescription drug monitoring programs 30 (PDMP). At least three other states have considered scheduling or otherwise monitoring 31 prescriptions of gabapentin. 32 33 Evidence for Off -Label Uses of Gabapentin 34 35 A title search for the term \"gabapentin\" of Cochrane Library reveals seven systematic reviews or 36 meta -analyses of gabapentin uses, and over 1,700 indiv idual trials. Gabapentin is currently only 37 FDA approved for postherpetic neuralgia and adjunctive therapy in epilepsy, but trials have been 38 conducted to evaluate gabapentin for a plethora of other indications . To give a sense of the sheer 39 breadth of applic ations for which gabapentin has been investigated, a sample of the 1700 trials 40 include, but are not limited to: diabetic neuropathy, restless leg syndrome (RLS), sleep, smoking 41 cessation, alcohol use disorder, cocaine use disorder, cannabis use disorder, f ibromyalgia, tinnitus, 42 social phobia, carpal syndrome, post -surgery uremic pruritis, radicular pain, 43 surgery pretreatment, topical anti -itching, post -operative nausea, 44 phantom limb pain, acute mania, hot f lashes and postural tachycardia syndrome. 45 46 Due to the volume of studied off -label uses of gabapentin and the varying range of study quality, it 47 is impossible to synthesize the evidence base for each indication. Table One , presented below, 48 attempts to capt ure some of the most common off -label uses of gabapentin and the current 49 understanding of the evidence for its use. 50 CSAPH Rep. 01- A-23 -- page 3 of 11 The current evidence shows that gabapentin may have some useful off -label applications primarily 1 in the fields of pain management and mental health , such as diabetic neuropathy9, post -operative 2 pain10, and conditional anxiety.11 For some applications, such as fibromyalgia12 or migraine 3 prophylaxis13, the current evidence base is less compelling. This report should not be construed as 4 clinical instructions or an endorsement of the off -label usage of gabapentin. P rescribers should 5 utilize evidence- based decision -making when prescribing any medication for off -label uses. 6 7 Gabapentin and the Ongoing Overdose Epidemic 8 9 Proponents of scheduling gabapentin raise concerns over potential misuse, morbidity, and mortality 10 associated with gabapentin.14 Overdoses solely attributed to gabapentin are described in the 11 literature as \"rare\".15 However, approximately 9.7 percent of overdose deaths examined in the 12 United States between 2019- 2020 detected gabapentin.16 Of those overdose deaths, almost 90 13 percent had at least one opioid (prescription or illicit) present in conjunction with gabapentin. 14 Similar results were observed in a study of fatalit ies associated with gabapentin in England - of 15 913 deaths in which gabapentin was detected, opioids were co- detected in 9 1 percent .17 In 25 16 percent of cases in which gabapentin and an opioid (including methadone and buprenorphine ) were 17 present, the two medications were co -prescribed. Finally, they found that only one of 913 deaths 18 could be attributed solely to gabapentin toxicity. Gabapentin is recognized as a 'cutting' agent for 19 heroin.18 As such, gabapentin's role appears to potentiate add itional respi ratory depress ion when 20 used concomitantly with other drugs known to cause respiratory depression, such as opioids . In a 21 2019 warning from the FDA, they indicated that \"[t] here is less evidence supporting the risk of 22 serious breathing difficulties in health y individuals taking gabapentinoids alone .\"19 23 24 Gabapentin monotherapy misuse is less documented . Individuals may use high doses of gabapentin 25 to induce euphoria but many, if not all, of these cases are observed in individuals with a history of 26 substance use disorders .20 In Germany ( a country w ith a significantly lower overdose mortality rate 27 than the United States) , a survey of addiction medicine specialists placed gabapentin in a similar 28 risk category as medications without misuse risk, such as non-steroidal anti -inflammator y drugs .21 29 30 It is difficult to assess the extent of gabapentin misuse. O nline marketing surveys from the United 31 Kingdom estimat e that gabapentin misuse across the general population is as high as 1 percent.22 32 However, t his number does not appear to be corroborated by clinical data , which found that there 33 were only 576 reported cases of gabapentin misuse to the FDA's Adverse Events Reporting System 34 across a 5 -year period during which ther e were approximately 200 million prescriptions of 35 gabapentin filled in the United States.23 36 37 Rather, gabapentin misuse is often reported in the context of potentiating other substances, such as 38 individuals under routine drug screens who potentiate buprenorphrine and/or naloxone with 39 gabapentin to induce euphoria while testing negative for opioids. Approximately 9 percent of 40 individuals seeking treatment for opioid use disorders self -reported misuse of gabapentin upon 41 entry into opioid use treatment clinics in the United States from 2019- 2020.24 Systematic reviews 42 have found that the largest risk fa ctor for gabapentin misuse is an opioid use disorder.25 43 44 The growing rates of use of gabapentin and subsequent perception of its misuse are tied to the 45 ongoing drug -related overdose epidemic. Based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 46 Clinical Practice Guidelines for Prescribing Opioids for Pain, utilization of multimodal pain 47 management approaches is critical to support ing effective care26. As such, gabapentin has seen 48 increases in prescribing as a key component of this multimodal approach , particularly in patients 49 who have comorbidities that limit the use of other pain management medications .27 In parallel to 50 CSAPH Rep. 01- A-23 -- page 4 of 11 concerns with increased opioid use , despite clear evidence for improved outcomes , stigmatizing 1 language of diversion and criminal activity is emerging surrounding gabapentinoid products . 2 The AMA has significant policy, advocacy, and ongoing work supporting evidence -based decision 3 making regarding the proper care of patients with pain and/or opioid use disorders. Research has 4 shown repeatedly that the best outcomes are those which are patient -centric , recognizing that 5 opioid use disorder is a medical diagnosis requiring treatment, not a criminal issue requiring 6 incarceration.28,29 7 8 REGULATING GABAPENTIN 9 10 Only a small number of states have chosen to pursue statutory or regulatory strategies specific to 11 gabapentin. This includes classifying the medication as a schedule V controlled substance and 12 requiring use of the PDMP; or requiring use of the PDMP without scheduling gabapentin. T he 13 Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) , with authority from the Controlled Substances Act, 14 maintains a list of substances which are placed under increased regulatory scrutiny, including 15 registration, production quotas, restrictio ns on research, and criminal or civil penalties for 16 possession.30 Substances are placed in different categories, or schedules, based on three factors: 17 potential for misuse, whether there are accepted medical uses, and the potential for addiction. 18 Schedule V is the lowest risk category, and are generally used for antidiarrheal, antitussive, and 19 analgesic medications. Examples of schedule V drugs include Lomotil, Motofen, Parepectolin, and 20 Lyrica (a gabapentinoid). 21 22 When the original resolution regarding gabapentin scheduling was presented at the House of 23 Delegates at the 2022 Annual Meeting, testimony provided anecdotal evidence towards concerning 24 patterns of misuse in non -prescribed gabapentin usage, particularly in incarcerated populations. 25 Since potential for misuse is a key criterion for DEA scheduling, it is important to appreciate the 26 magnitude of misuse . However, published literature on misuse of gabapentin is limited , and 27 primarily in populations co -using with opioids . For example, in one study of individuals seeking 28 inpatient opioid detoxification, 71 percent of respondents indicated that they were using gabapentin 29 without a prescription for the purpose of reducing opioid withdrawal symptoms, and 58 percent 30 reported they used gabapentin without a prescription to reduce their cravings for opioids.31 At the 31 population- level, one study of law enforcement found 407 cases of diverted gabapentin between 32 the years of 2002 to 2015, with a peak rate of 0.027 cases per 100,000 population.32 Another study 33 found that 3 percent of commercially insured patients requested 3 or more prescription claims 34 above the established dosage thresholds if they were seeking gabapentin on its own.33 This number 35 rose to 24 percent if they were seeking gabapentin co -prescribed with opioids. Due to the 36 interconnectivity of gabapentin misuse with opioid use disorders - including instances which are 37 intended to reduce opioid use - it is difficult to asses s the true misuse risk of gabapentin. 38 39 Currently, gabapentin is not scheduled as a controlled substance by the DEA, but seven states 40 (Alabama, Kentucky, Michigan, North Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia) have 41 classified gabapentin as a schedule V controlled substance.3 While schedule V is the lowest risk 42 categorization of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (although states may have different 43 definitions under their own controlled substance regulations ), it still require s physicians and other 44 health care professionals who prescribe or dispense controlled substances to regis ter with the DEA. 45 Schedule V controlled substances are subject to restrictions on storage, security, and the amount, 46 timing and frequency of refills.34 A sub -population of pa tients particularly sensitive to changes in 47 regulations are those within the carceral system, where prescribing of gabapentin is already heavily 48 scrutinized, and the stigma and criminalization of pain treatment is highest.35 49 CSAPH Rep. 01- A-23 -- page 5 of 11 There are 13 states , including Connecticut, Indiana, Louisiana, Ohio, Oregon, and Utah, that have 1 required reporting of gabapentin prescriptions into their PDMPs . These requirements are meant, in 2 part, to allow physicians, pharmacists and other health care professionals to v iew recent 3 prescriptions and prescription patterns of gaba pentin and other controlled substances, such as 4 opioids and benzodiazepines , to support evidence -based prescribing decisions . The AMA and 5 many ot hers have long supported using PDMPs as part of the c linical decision -making process, but 6 emphasized that information in a PDMP is only one of many factors a physician should consider 7 when determining whether to prescribe controlled substances36. 8 9 With respect to the question whether to add gabapentin as a S chedule V Controlled Substance, the 10 role of the PDMP needs additional consideration. When PDMP re quirements first came into vogue, 11 the general argument for mandating their use was the potential to reduce opioid- related misuse and 12 opioid- related mortality. There is some evidence showing use of PDMPs increased the ability of 13 physicians and pharmacists to identify multiple prescriber events, that is, when an individual 14 received three or more opioid prescriptions from three or more different prescribers or disp ensers 15 within a short time frame, typically 30 days.37 Many states have reported reductions in these 16 multiple prescription events , but as detailed in AMA Board of Trustees Report 3- I-16, merely 17 identifying a multiple prescriber event is not sufficient to know whether a patient is engaging in 18 aberrant behavior, someone who has uncoordinated care , or is pursuing illegal prescriptions . Thus, 19 while reductions in multiple prescriber events are likely positive, it is not clear whether the 20 reductions have led to improved patient outcomes. In addition, there has been no reduction in 21 opioid- related mortality as PDMP use has increased . In 2022, physicians and other health care 22 professionals used PDMPs more than 1.1 billion times while the overdose epide mic grew to more 23 than 107,000 fatalities.38 Furthermore, there is no compelling evidence suggesting that PDMPs 24 helped improve outcomes for patients with pain. There also continues to be confusion about how to 25 optimize PDMPs in clinical practice.39 26 27 It is important to note that PDMPs have limitations. While different PDMP platforms claim to 28 allow for interstate access of patient information, such retrieval is not always reliable if the user has 29 not set the PDMP up to view all states \u2014or even all neighboring states. There also continue to be 30 challenges in reporting intervals from when a prescription is dispensed to when data is uploaded to 31 the PDMP. Physicians and other health care professionals also continue to report frustration with 32 PDMP -induced disruptions or poor interoperability with electronic health records.40,41 Given the 33 absence of data suggesting that a PDMP reduces drug -related misuse or other harms, along with a 34 clear -eyed view of PDMP limitations, it is unlikely that having gabapentin in the PDMP \u2014by virtue 35 of it being a Schedule V Controlled Substance \u2014will improve outcomes, increase meaningfully 36 available information, or improve patient outcomes. 37 38 In comparing states which designated gabapentin as a schedule V controlled substance and states 39 which required gabapentin reporting to the PDMP alone , states that designated gabapentin a 40 controlled substance (which includes automatic registration in the state PDMP), sa w a significant 41 decrease in the number of gabapentin prescriptions .42 By contrast, states which implemented a 42 PDMP reporting- only approach saw little change in the number of gabapentin prescriptions .43 This 43 is not surprising as the requirements for prescri bing a Schedule V controlled substance are greater 44 than for a non- controlled substance. 45 46 Proponents of scheduling gabapentin as a controlled substance use this evidence, that designating 47 gabapentin as a schedule V controlled substance reduce s prescription s, as a surrogate for 48 decreas ing patient harm .44 The literature regarding scheduling gabapentin as a controlled substance 49 lacks information regarding indication for use or patient oriented outcomes, such as pain control, 50 increased functioning, prevalence of adverse events or evidence of decreases in misuse. S tigma and 51 CSAPH Rep. 01- A-23 -- page 6 of 11 prescribing barriers have the potential to impede access to care, particularly pain management. 1 When strategies simply aim to decrease the overall number of prescriptions, marginalized and/or 2 underserved patients will often be turned away first . Black patients are at highest risk for receiving 3 inadequate pain treatment and are up to 36 percent less likely to re ceive any analgesic 4 pharmacotherapy compared to white patients.45,46 In the event that they do present with a substance 5 use disorder, Black patients covered by Medicaid have a 50 percent lower rate of prescribing 6 buprenorphine compared to white patients when controlled against other clinical and demographic 7 factors.47 There are many reasons for this inequity, but at its core, the implicit bias and associations 8 made between Black patients, pain med ication , and criminal behavior is difficult to ign ore.48 It is 9 likely that further stigmatization of gabapentin prescribing and emphasis on misuse and diversion 10 could result in similar inequities . 11 12 In addition, the nation's overdose epidemic and its intense focus on reducing opioid prescriptions 13 provide a useful point of comparison. In 2012- 2013 , physicians began to reduce opioid 14 prescriptions in response to growing concerns about misuse. Between 2012- 2021, opioid 15 prescriptions have declined in every state \u201446.4 percent nationwide.49 As noted above, this 16 reduction has not led to reduce d drug -related overdose or death. The inverse actually has occurred. 17 This is not to say that reduction in opioid prescribing were not warranted in certain circumstances, 18 but as noted by the AMA in comments to the CDC and other s, the focus should always have been 19 on ensuring patients with pain received the r ight care at the right time, which may include opioid 20 therapy50. The AMA supports continued efforts to enhance medical education and training, 21 including those focused on medi cations that may be misused or used without a prescription. The 22 AMA further supports efforts , including research and medical society collaboration to support 23 effective pain care. These efforts could be interpret ed to include gabapentin, but are certainly not 24 limited to one medication and its potential uses, as noted above. These efforts already occur 25 without having to increase the barriers to gabapentin by making it a Schedule V controlled 26 substance. An end goal of simply reducing prescripti ons is shortsighted and inappropriate. 27 28 Beyond regulatory solutions, best practices for prescribing gabapentin continue to evolve. The 29 FDA is the appropriate agency to continue to evaluate drug safety. The AMA and organized 30 medicine are the appropriate ent ities to support and encourage enhanced education about 31 prescribing practices, including gabapentin.51 32 33 CONCLUSION 34 35 With the longevity of gabapentin on the market, combined with the incredibly wide range of trials, 36 and the low incidence of adverse events, t here is not a compelling reason to designate gabapentin 37 as a controlled substance. The available evidence does not demonstrate that the benefits of 38 scheduling gabapentin outweigh the risk of patient harm. Instead, strategies to increase prescriber 39 awareness of gabapentin's potentiator effect and more thoughtful prescribing, particularly in 40 groups at high- risk for overdose , will target increases in medication safety . The recognition of 41 stigma and bias is critical for continued evidence -based decision- making and increased access to 42 those in need. 43 44 RECOMMENDATIONS 45 46 The Council on Science and Public Health recommends that the following be adopted and the 47 remainder of the report be filed. 48 CSAPH Rep. 01-A-23 -- page 7 of 11 1.

REPORT OF THE COUNCIL ON SCIENCE AND PUBLIC HEALTH CSAPH Report 02- A-23 Subject: Improving Research Standards, Approval Processes, and Post -Market Surveillance Standards for Medical Devices Presented by: Noel Deep, MD, Chair Referred to: Reference Committee E Resolution 523- A-22, \"Improving Research Standards, Approval Processes, and Post -Market Surveillance Standards for Medical Devices\" was referred by the House of Delegates (HOD) . This report serves as the Council on Science and Public Health's (CSAPH) findings and recommendations regarding medical device regulation . METHODS English language articles were selected from searches of PubMed and Google Scholar using the search terms \"medical device AND 510(k)\" and \"medical device AN D post -market surveillance\". Additional articles were identified by manual review of the reference lists of pertinent publications. Web sites managed by government agencies and applicable organizations were also reviewed for relevant information. BACKGROU ND In the context of regulatory oversight by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) , a medical device has a broad definition. According to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act: a device is: an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, i n vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including a component part, or accessory which is: [...] (B) intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or ot her animals, or (C) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals, and which does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and which does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of its primary intended purposes . As such, the breadth of items captured within this regulatory framework is expansive , ranging from tongue depressors and eyeglasses to x-ray machines and hip replacements. In addition to physical objects used as medical devices, software and algorithms a re also captured within this defin ition. As such, the FDA classifies software into two broad categories: software in a medical device and software as a medical device (SaMD). CSAPH recognizes that software , particularly SaMD, is rapidly becoming a large part of medical care and may warrant further examination beyond the CSAPH Rep. 02- A-23 -- page 2 of 9 findings and recommendations of this report, which are intended to be generalizable to all medical devices. DISCUSSION The 510(k) Regulatory Pathway When applying for a new medical device, the device is first evaluated for risk category: I (lowest risk), II (medium risk) or III (highest risk). Risk category is determined by a variety of factors, such as by comparing the device to a similar, known, device. If a device is found to be like a device already approve d by the FDA, it may be classified as low (class I) or medium (class II) risk. Examples of devices commonly found to be class I include electric toothbrushes, tongue depressors, bandages, hospital beds, and non -electric wheelchairs. Examples of devices com monly found to be class II include catheters, pregnancy test kits, syringes, contact lenses, and surgical gloves. Examples of devices commonly found to be class III include breast implants, pacemakers, defibrillators , and cochlear implants. Approximately 1% of all new medical device applications from 200 3 to 2017 were evaluated as high risk (class III). i,ii If a medical device is found to be class I they are typically exempt from normal testing. If deemed a class II risk, manufacturers may submit a 510(k) application as pre -market notification (PMN) to the FDA. C lass II risk devices are subjected to an equivalence evaluation comparing this product to one currently on the market through these 510(k) processes . 510(k) applications are processed within 90 days and once approved, the device is eligible for market. By contrast, class III devices must undergo pre -market approval (PMA) which requires two lar ge clinical trials. According to a 2010 industry survey, pursuing pre -market approval in the United States takes on average 54 months to complete compared to 11 months in European countries . iii Medical device market approval differs from drug approval in a few critical ways, which may help illustrate why the 510(k) pathway is so desirable for medical device manufacturers. Table 1 in the appendix of this report highlights some of these differences. Clinical trial design for medical devices can be extremely difficult, and in some cases unethical. For example, a placebo control for a medical device could require a high- risk sham surgery. As such, subjecting all new medical devices to undergo clinical trials may substantially hinder innovation, particularly fr om physicians seeking small tweaks or customizations to products they use routinely. But on the other hand, if a medical device does cause harm to a patient, one cannot simply discontinue having an implanted device without significant intervention un like if they were experiencing adverse events to a new medication that could be quickly stopped. As such, the 510(k) pathway has been subject to intense public scrutiny, both in the media and by elected officials. iv Many recalls of medical devices are voluntarily initiated by the manufacturer due to liability concerns or public perception decreasing sales rather than by official FDA action. The FDA has recently begu n piloting a new program within the 510(k) framework , called the Safety and Performance Based Pathway . This pathway provides an alternative to the current equivalence evaluation for a small subset of devices that are highly studied and well -known. In the Safety and Performance Based Pathway, the FDA sets forth explicit benchmarks that medical devices must satisfy to demonstrate safety and efficacy to gain 510(k) approval .v For example, if a resorbable surgical sutures manufacturer wished to market a new design, the FDA has guidance for the appropriate diameter, needle attachment, tensile strength, sterilization, shelf life and resorption profile for new suture designs to meet to receive 510(k ) classification.vi This pathway provides CSAPH Rep. 02- A-23 -- page 3 of 9 added safety and efficacy requirements to this moderate risk class. However, participation in the Safety and Performance Based Pathway is currently optional . Device Equivalence To be eligible for the 510(k) approval , a manufacturer must first establish that their device is \"substantially equivalent \" to a previously known, FDA -approved predicate device.vii For the purposes of regulatory approval, the FDA considers both safety and f unctionality when determining equivalence. First, they investigate whether the device is to be used for the same primary purpose, and they then evaluate whether the device is expected to have a similar safety profile. For example, if a device were to change its power source (such as hardwired vs. rechargeable) with no other modifications, it would likely be deemed substantially equivalent. Similarly, if the material of the dev ice were to change to another material known to be safe to the FDA, it is likely to be found substantially equivalent. A flowchart of the FDA decision making process has been included in the Appendix of this report. However, there is a flaw with th e appro ach of substantial equivalence. If a device is found to be unsafe after receiving market approval and then subjected to a recall, any subsequent devices which used the original , now -unsafe device as their predicate , are not subjected to any increased scrut iny or recalls. Recent analysis found that between the period of 2017 and 2021, the FDA initiated recalls of 156 devices using their highest risk categorization - devices with a reasonable probability to cause severe morbidity and mortality. Of those 156 devices recalled, 44.1 percent of them had received 510(k) approval using substantial equivalence to a device that had also been the subject of a recall. viii Further, 48.1 percent of devices recalled within the studied period have themselves been used as the predicate for another device's 510(k) approva l. This post marketing safety information and related devices draw significant attention to potential problems with the current 510( k) approval process with a lack of criterion for granting approval for devices outside the most well - studied and well -understood. Post-Market Surveillance It should be noted that the study described above only studied a cohort of devices which were the subject of FDA -initiated recalls. There are likely a non-trivial number of devices that are still being used as comparators for substantial equivalence that have been found to be unsafe and then production halted or voluntarily recalled by the manufacturer. However, the re is limited publicly available information to monitor this risk . This scenario highlights the importance of rigorous post - market surveillance for devices that have been approved using the 510(k) pathway. Among the post -market surveillance activities required by the FDA i s the reporting of adverse events. Under Medical Device Reporting regulations ( Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations part 803), manufacturers, importers, and device user facilities ( such as a hospital, nursing home or outpatient treatment facilities ) are mandatory reporters to the FDA regarding serious device malfunction , including death. Reports are made to the device manufacturer (if known) and the FDA. Health care professionals, patients, and caregivers are able to report suspected adverse events for medical devices using the FDA's MedWatch portal . Adverse events are viewable to health care professionals and the public using the FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) portal. ix However, a 2019 expos \u00e9 found that over 5 million incidents of reported adverse events were being kept from public view using an internal \"alternative summary reporting\" repository rather than the publicly available MAUDE database.x Not only did this practice prevent physicians and patients from knowing the CSAPH Rep. 02- A-23 -- page 4 of 9 real risks of currently approved medical devices, it also prevented manufacturers of new devices from knowing the risk profile of substantially similar predicate devices they were using for 510(k) approval. The FDA has stated that it has since abandoned this practice of internal incident report storage .xi Health Equity Considerations It should also be noted that implicit in the 510(k) substantial equivalence method of approval is that it tends to maintain the statu s quo. For example, most, if not all, pulse oximeters currently used in the United States are approved via the 510(k) pathway.xii Pulse oximeters estimate blood oxygen saturation by shining light through the skin, typically on a fingertip or an ear lobe. Oxygenated blood absorbs red light more efficiently than de -oxygenated blood, thus allowing for estimates of oxygenation by simply measuring the amount of red light that passes through a tissue. However, oxygenated blood is not the only thing that absorbs re d light - melanin, melanosomes, and melanocytes (ie, skin pigmentation), also absorb or scatter red light. A retrospective study found that practitioners missed hypoxemia diagnoses in 11.7 percent of Black patients compared to 3.6 percent of white patients due to pulse oximetry overestimating blood oxygenation.xiii In the context of the COVID -19 pandemic, that suggests that excluding other factors, Black patients would be nearly 4- times less likely to receive oxygenation therapy such as a ventilator, which could prevent progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome.xiv As a result of these findings, the FDA released a safety communication indicating oximeters may be less accurate in darker skin tones.xv The failure of pulse oximeters to accurately measure oxygen saturation in all skin tones is a clear example of how inequity enters the health care system from many sources and can cascade. For example, even if a provider wished to start a patient on oxyge nation therapy, Medicare reimbursement for supplemental oxygen therapy is only approved if a patient has a blood oxygenation reading less than or equal to 89 percent , which is less likely in Black patients if a pulse oximeter is used.xvi In November 2022, t he FDA hosted an advisory committee meeting to discuss concerns of pulse oximeters and skin pigmentation. Dr. Jesse Ehrenfeld, president -elect of the AMA, was a participant of this meeting and delivered comments and recommendations on behalf of the AMA. It is important to assess whether approving a new pulse oximeter design that reaches the same level of performance as a predicate device is appropriate as our appreciation of inequity grows and some categories of devices no longer match the values we wish t o uphold. Off-Label Use of Medical Devices While the FDA has attempted to pilot programs , such as the Safety and Performance Based Pathway, that would improve th e balance of fostering innovation and patient safety, they may not have the legislative autho rity or resources available to make these new programs mandatory. Without authority to pursue reforms to medical device regulation, there are concerns that the FDA may become more and more likely to begin regulating the practice of medicine to achieve similar goals . The FDA has the authority to ban medical devices if they present a substantial deception to patients about the benefits or an unreasonable and substantial risk of injury. However, there are recent concerns of misuse of the banni ng process. In 2020, the FDA published a rule banning the use of electrical stimulation devices (ESD) for the treatment of self -injurious and/or aggressive behavior.xvii The FDA reported that t he use of ESDs for this indication was unsafe and could lead to significant physical and psychological harm. ESDs were still approved for other indications such CSAPH Rep. 02- A-23 -- page 5 of 9 as smoking cessation.xviii The approval of devices for specific indications while banning the same device for others is, per AMA policy , the FDA regulating the pr actice of medicine. The AMA has extensive policy and significant history defending the rights of physicians to practice medicine and protect off -label prescribing of pharmaceutics and devices. Within the text of the FDA's rule on banning ESDs for aggress ive behavior, they cite the 510(k) pathway as part of their justification for the banning of a specific indication , as they evaluate risk of a device based on its intended function, not on all potential functionalities . For example, daily wear vs. extended wear for gas permeable contact lenses are two separate risk categories. Evaluation of \"substantially similar\" for the purposes of 510(k) approval includes analysis of similar function. In 2021, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the ban, finding that the FDA was in fact regulating the practice of medicine, per the holdings of Judge Rotenberg Educational Center v. United States Food and Drug Administration.xix CONCLUSION While the FDA has made strides in improving the 510(k) process for m edical device approval , such as through the Safety and Performance Based Pathway, recent data have shown serious safety concerns . These safety concerns denote the need for the process to be re-examin ed to support the purpose and benefits of accelerated pat hways along with providing the FDA with the statutory authority to address the larger, systemic issues without impeding on the practice of medicine . RECOMMENDATIONS The Council on Science and Public Health recommends the following be adopted , and the remainder of the report be filed : 1. Our AMA believes that to support innovation while protecting patient safety, approval pathways for medical devices should incorporate the following principles: a. Evidence -based, measurable performance benchmarks, such as those used in the Safety and Performance Based Pathway , should be used wherever possible for classes of known, well -studied medical devices; and b. For a subset of higher risk devices receiving approval but have not completed clinical trials, time-limited approvals may be appropriate , after which the manufacturer may be required to provide post -market data to support full device approval; and c. Medical devices with known safety concerns should not be usable as predicate devices for the purposes of proving substantial equivalence. In the event safety concerns of predicate devices arise after approval has been granted, additional due diligence should be initiated as appropriate; and d. Approval for medical devices should include criteria for adequate performance in racialized, minoritized, o r otherwise historically excluded groups ; and e. Report s of adverse events for medical devices should always be available in a publicly a ccessible, searchable database such as the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience.

REPORT OF THE COUNCIL ON SCIENCE AND PUBLIC HEALTH CSAPH Report 03- A-23 Subject: Regulation and Control of Self -Service Labs Presented by: Noel Deep, MD, Chair Referred to: Reference Committee E At the 2022 Annual Meeting of the American Medical Association (AMA), the House of Delegates 1 adopted Policy D -260.992, \"Regulation and Control of Self -Service Labs.\" That directive called for 2 a study into \"patient -directed self -service testing, including t he accreditation and licensing of 3 laboratories that sell self -ordered tests and physician liability related to non- physician- ordered 4 tests\". This report serves as the Council on Science and Public Health's (CSAPH) findings and 5 recommendations regarding self-service testing, also known as direct access testing ( DAT ) or 6 direct -to-consumer (DTC) testing . The Council has previously studied DTC genetic testing which 7 shares many issues with DAT . For the purposes of this report, DAT refers solely to non- genetic, 8 non-imaging based diagnostic testing. 9 10 METHODS 11 12 English language articles were selected from searches of PubMed and Google Scholar using the 13 search terms \"direct access testing\", \"self-service laboratory\", \"direct \"self -service laboratory AND liability\". Additional articles w ere identified by manual review of the 15 reference lists of pertinent publications. Web sites managed by government agencies and applicable 16 organizations w ere also reviewed for relevant information. 17 18 BACKGROUND 19 20 Patient -directed testing has existed in the United States for decades, such as over -the-counter 21 glucose testing kits available since the early 1980s. Currently , pharmacies sell a variety of at -home 22 tests for pregnancy , illicit drug use , or other biomark ers. However, starting in the late 2010s, 23 diagnostic companies b egan to offer a compilation of blood- based DAT s such as hormone panels, 24 electrolytes, heavy metal screening , metabolic panels, and prostate specific antigen (PSA) . 25 According to one estimate, the market for DAT in the United States currently exceeds $350 million 26 per year, up from just $15 million per year in 2010. 1 Another source estimates that the DTC genetic 27 and DAT lab services market s combined will exceed $2.4 billion per ye ar by 2025.2 For the 28 purposes of this report, DAT will refer to medical tests that are not available as over -the-counter 29 kits and are performed by a laboratory after being purchased by an individual without a 30 prescription. 31 32 The DAT business model removes the health care professional , often the primary care physician, 33 from the care decision -making and allows an individual to directly purchase their test from the 34 laboratory. Overall, there is limited literature on DAT, the model, and outcomes for patients a nd 35 their care. According to the Frequently Asked Questions web page of one DAT company, orders for 36 these tests are provided by a licensed clinician upon demand, but these tests are not reimbursed by 37 insurance as they are not the treating health care professional and they do not provide CPT codes .3 38 CSAPH Rep. 03- A-23 -- page 2 of 6 1 While the process may vary from company to company, the y generally follow similar steps. First, a 2 patie nt is presented with a menu of available testing options. They then select the test( s) they would 3 like performed , and then pay up- front for the test. A licensed clinician then orders the test, which 4 the companies claim does not constitute a patient -physici an relationship. The patient then visits a 5 nearby facility for their sample(s) to be taken, and they receive their result s within a few days. 6 Results are often reported in the same manner as they would from a prescribed test in the usual 7 course of care - a single value with solely the reference range as context. Unlike tests that come 8 from a prescribing physician within a health -system , DAT companies do not provide any 9 diagnostic assessment, counseling, or guidance on laboratory results. Patients are encouraged to 10 share their results with their physicians, but it is unclear if or how any DAT facilities enter results 11 into the electronic medical record or otherwise to alert a health care professional that a test has 12 been performed . 13 14 DISCUSSION 15 16 Patient Safety 17 18 The most obvious concern around DAT is patient safety. Assuming the patient identif ies an 19 appropriate test to measure the biomarker of interest , patients often receive a single numerical 20 value and a reference range for their test results with no additional description or suggested next 21 steps. However, interpreting medical tests is more than simply seeing if a number is within the 22 reference range. Physicians have years of training and experience to incorporate the quantitative 23 information of medical tests with the qualitative information collected from the patient, including 24 past medical history or signs and symptoms . Take for example the measurement of thyroid 25 stimulating hormone (TSH), which typically has a reference range listed of 1 to 4.5 mlU/L , 26 depending on the assay. A non- trained individual may receive a result of 4. 3 mlU/L , see that it is 27 within the provided reference range , and assume they have healthy th yroid function. However, a 28 trained physician may recognize that in combination with presenting symptoms or other risk 29 factors , that this individual may have early hypothyroidism and can begin intervention.4 30 31 Risk assessment is a critical factor for interpreting and acting upon medical test results, but it is 32 also a key consideration for prescribing the test in the first place. For example, for PSA screening 33 the USPSTF recommends a shared decision -making model, in which men aged 55 to 69 should be 34 informed of the potential risks and benefits of PSA screening before making the decision with their 35 physician.5 PSA levels could be elevated from several non -cancer sources, such as benign prostatic 36 hyperplasia or prostatitis, and that the risk of dying from prostate cancer was approximately 2.5 37 percent. Studies have found that approximately 80 percent of men who pursued aggressive clinical 38 action such as brachytherapy due to elevated PSA levels experienced erectile dysfunction or 39 incontinence as a result of treatment.6 In recommending a screening one needs to consider the risks 40 of false positives and over -diagnosis of benign, non- fatal prostate cancers outweighed that may 41 outweigh benefits of early detection. USPSTF has found that PSA testing outside of a ve ry specific 42 risk category offers poor or even negative value to the patient.7 This crucial risk -benefit analysis 43 and discussion is missing when an individual can simply order a PSA test from a DAT website and 44 may lead to unwanted outcomes. DAT companies do not follow any clinical guidelines for any test 45 provided. They do not limit test offerings to those in the appropriate risk categories. 46 47 Legal Landscape 48 49 While the definition varies from state to state, the practice of medicine is typically defined as 50 diagnosing, treating, or advising a patient on their symptoms or disease. It appears that DAT 51 CSAPH Rep. 03- A-23 -- page 3 of 6 companies are pursuing a loophole - if they explicitly do not advise a patient on what their test 1 results mean, or use a biomarker to diagnose, they contend it is not practicing medicine. Currently 2 37 states allow DAT with varying levels of restriction. It should be noted that depending on the 3 state, DAT companies m ight utilize a dentist, nurse practitioner, physician assistant, naturopathic 4 doctor, li censed acupunc turist, or chiropractor to order tests. 5 6 There are also concerns about the d uty of the physician when a patient presents with DAT results 7 and requests their physician take clinical action . While the Council does not intend to offer clinical 8 guidance, it cannot identify any scenario in which the action by the physician, if they choose to act 9 at all, can be anything but re -ordering the test through appropriate channels . This is especially true 10 in instances where the patient may have ordered a test the physician is inexperienced with - how 11 can they be expected to act upon, and be liable for , a test they would not have ordered themselves ? 12 Current AMA policy and the Code of Medical Ethics regardin g direct -to-consumer diagnostic 13 imaging services state s that any physician ordering a test is the responsible party for diagnosis and 14 subsequent patient counseling.8 15 16 Finally, there are also concerns about the regulations of the laboratories performing the tests. There 17 are two main ways in which clinical testing is regulated in the United States. First, if a test is fully 18 self-contained (ie, a test kit), then it is revi ewed for medical claims by the Food and Drug 19 Administration (FDA) as a n in vitro medical device. For all other medical testing, such as 20 laboratory developed tests, laboratories are regulated , inspected, and certified by the Center s for 21 Medicare and Medicai d Services (CMS) under the Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendment 22 (CLIA). The FDA categorizes laboratory tests b ased on complexity, which CMS then uses to 23 develop regulations. Depending on the categorization of test complexity, CLIA may require quality 24 standards for facility administration, laboratory systems, personnel qualifications, quality 25 assessment, and quality control. CLIA certification is provided by CMS -approved accrediting 26 bodies, such as the Joint Commission or the College of American Pathol ogists. Studies have found 27 that the introduction of CLIA resulted in an increase in laboratory quality and customer 28 satisfaction.9 29 30 There have been reports that some companies offering DAT skirt the CLIA certification process by 31 claiming that since they o nly provide a context -free biomarker value, they are providing \"health 32 information\" rather than a medical test.10 Ensuring that these tests are performed in CLIA -certified 33 laboratories is critical for maintaining the accuracy of the results while also maki ng sure patients' 34 samples and data are secure and stored appropriately. 35 36 Examining the Appeal 37 38 When assessing issues of DAT regulations, it is also important to understand the use-cases and 39 surrounding ecosystem that has caused the market for DAT s to flourish. DAT marketing often 40 emphasizes a few key points: it is faster, the cost is upfront and known ( ie, there is no unknown co- 41 pay that will be administered later), and that an individual will be able to take control over their 42 health. The first two claim s are interconnected and point to the role health insurance companies 43 play in reimbursement for testing. For example, studies have shown that when individuals enroll in 44 a high de ductible insurance plan, they are approximately 10 percent less likely to receive laboratory 45 tests due to the financial disincentive.11 It is also important to recognize that an insurance provider 46 may require prior authorization , and then ultimately declin e coverage, for outpatient laboratory 47 testing which adds significant delays and cost uncertainty for a patient. 48 49 Additionally, there are several tests offered by DAT companies for conditions which unfortunately 50 carry high levels of social stigma - particularly infectious diseases such as sexually transmitted 51 CSAPH Rep. 03- A-23 -- page 4 of 6 infections or hepatitis. In these instances, availability of a test which can be ordered online and 1 without a n uncomfortable conversation with their physician may be attractive to many patients. 2 Tests for influenza or other respiratory viruses that can be ordered for home sample collection may 3 also reduce the risk of transmission in a hospital or clinic setting. However, those instances in 4 which DAT s may be an appe aling option further underscore the need for ensuring DAT facilities 5 are CLIA -certified and responsible for the appropriate patient counseling on result interpretation 6 and any necessary lifestyle changes. 7 8 Finally, DAT s are often marketed to the individual who is seeking to better understand and control 9 their health. For example, DAT companies may offer cholesterol panel testing , which would be 10 appealing to someone who has changed their diet or exercise routine and is e ager to see results. 11 While those goals should be applauded, there are multiple risks associated with this approach. First, 12 if the test is inaccurate, the individual will be given a false understanding of changes in their health . 13 Second, the individual may not properly understand the time it may take for their changes to have 14 an impact on a clinical biomarker, nor may they appreciate the healthy fluctuation the biomarker 15 levels may have from day- to-day, or the size of impact their lifestyle changes may have on the 16 biomarker. In some instances, an individual could discontinue medication or other treatments if 17 they are given inaccurate test results devoid of context. Again, this highlights the critical 18 importance of physician counseling in health management , as none of this information is currently 19 communicated to patients utilizing DAT companies. 20 21 CONCLUSION 22 23 In a system of complex insurance reimbursement and high out -of-pocket plans, DATs may appear 24 appealing for patients . However, current DAT practices appear to skirt regulatory requirements, 25 could easily be misinterpreted by patients , and lack appropriate diagnostic and c ounseling practices 26 by a physician . Potential utilization of DAT may be warranted in the realm of infectious disease 27 when immediate testing would be beneficial for public health ; however, test results should still be 28 carefully communicated to the patient a nd monitored by a physician who is responsible for the 29 patient's care. 30 31 RECOMMENDATIONS 32 33 The Council on Science and Public Health recommends the following recommendations be 34 adopted, and the remainder of the report be filed: 35 36 1. Direct access testing, in whic h patients may order a diagnostic laboratory test on demand, 37 should only be provided by teams which are physician- led, and performed in facilities that 38 are CLIA -certified. 39 40 2. Health care professionals who offer direct access testing services, for which a pat ient does 41 not have a referral , recogniz e that agreeing to perform direct -to-consumer testing on 42 request: 43 a. establishes a patient relationship, with all the ethical and professional obligations 44 such relationship entails; and 45 b. assumes responsibility for relevant clinical evaluation, including pre - and post -test 46 counseling about the test, its results, and indicated follow -up. Health care 47 professional s may choose to refer the patient for post -test counseling to an 48 appropriate prov ider who accepts the patient , but they maintain ethical and 49 professional responsibility until the patient has been seen by that provide r; and 50 CSAPH Rep. 03- A-23 -- page 5 of 6 shall report all required findings to relevant oversight entities, such as state public 1 health agencies, even if t he patient and the laboratory are not co -localized in the 2 same jurisdiction.

AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 501 (A-23) Introduced by: Medical Student Section Subject: AMA Study of Chemical Castration in Incarceration Referred to: Reference Committee E Whereas, Chemical castration is defined as the use of pharmacologic agents, including anti - 1 antagonists and gonadotropin- releasing hormone agonists, to reduce serum testosterone 2 levels and quell libido in individuals diagnosed with a paraphilic disorder and other individuals 3 who commit sexual offenses, in an effort to reduce the occurrence of sexual offenses1,2; and 4 5 Whereas, 4,984 people are currently incarcerated for sexual offenses in federal prisons3,4; 6 and 7 8 Whereas, Several states have passed or debated statutes requiring chemical castration for 9 individuals who commit sexual offenses as a sentence and/or as a requirement for parole, 10 most recently Alabama in 2019, where offenders are required to pay for their own treatment, 11 and in Tennessee in 20201,5-8; and 12 13 Whereas, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM )-V defines \"paraphilic 14 disorder\" as \"recurrent and intense sexual arousal over a period of at least 6 months with 15 nonconsenting victims through voyeurism, exhibitionism, frotteurism, sexual sadism, and 16 pedophilia\" and estimated lifetime prevalences are 12% for males and 4% for females9; and 17 18 Whereas, Chemical castration can be traced to the 1900s eugenics movement where people 19 with developmental delays and psychiatric diagnoses were forcibly sterilized, including up to 20 60,000 incarcerated women diagnosed with and intellectual disability1; and 21 22 Whereas, Chemical castration via injection with Depo- Provera (medroxyprogesterone 23 acetate) and surgical sterilization have historically disproportionately targeted Black 24 individuals in the United States, including the deceptive, experimental testing of Depo- 25 Provera as a method of birth control on young Black females in the 1960s10,11; and 26 27 Whereas, The current method of chemical castration for incarcerated males who committed 28 sex offenses in several states, including California and Florida, is via injection with Depo - 29 Provera, although no medication, including Depo- Provera, is currently FDA -approved for 30 chemical castration12; and 31 32 Whereas, Limited evidence exists for the effectiveness of chemical castration, with several 33 studies noting that chemical castration does not address the core psychological impulses 34 relating to sexually aberrant behavior12,13; and 35 36 Whereas, When chemical castration is a requirement for parole, judges, not medical doctors, 37 are charged with deciding whether or not a prisoner receives chemical castration therapy, 38 suggesting that chemical castration constitutes punishment instead of rehabilitative therapy12; 39 and 40 Resolution: 501 (A-23) Page 2 of 5 Whereas, The Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers (ATSA) published a 2012 1 statement on the use of chemical castration for individuals with paraphilic disorders and 2 individuals who commit sexual offenses, concluding that chemical castration may be effective 3 for certain patients when combined with other non- pharmacologic interventions such as 4 psychotherapy14; and 5 6 Whereas, The issue of chemical castration is rife with ethical quandaries and valid arguments 7 may exist both in support of and in opposition to this practice15; and 8 9 Whereas, In situations where chemical castration is a requirement for parole, some may 10 argue that this requirement unjustly coerces an individual to agree to a medical procedure, 11 while others may argue that if chemical castration was not required, an individual may never 12 be allowed the possibility of parole at all and may remain incarcerated15; and 13 14 Whereas, Scientific research, medical information, and expert opinions from physicians on 15 the issue of chemical castration for individuals who commit sexual offenses, especially in the 16 last 5 years, are difficult to find most likely since the population affected by chemical 17 castration have not been the subject of much retrospective research; and 18 19 Whereas, The American Psychiatric Association raised concerns in July 2021 about the use 20 of chemical castration as a condition for parole, citing ethical concerns ov er the minimal to 21 absent involvement of physicians and calling the \"court -driven, one -size-fits-all approach to 22 anti-androgen treatment inconsistent with contemporary medical practice\"16; and 23 24 Whereas, Our American Medical Association previously adopted P olicy 140.955, \"Court - 25 Ordered Castration,\" which stated that \"The AMA opposes physician participation in 26 castration and other surgical or medical treatments initiated solely for criminal punishment,\" 27 but this policy was later rescinded due to being considered duplicative of Code of Medical 28 Ethics Opinion 9.7.2, \"Court -Initiated Medical Treatment in Criminal Cases\"17-18; and 29 30 Whereas, While the AMA Code of Medical Ethics Opinion 9.7.2 states that \"physicians who 31 provide care under court order should: (a) Par ticipate only if the procedure being mandated is 32 therapeutically efficacious and is therefore undoubtedly not a form of punishment or solely a 33 mechanism of social control,\" the morality of chemical castration under this Code is unclear, 34 including its use as efficacious treatment, as a mechanism for social control, as a tool for 35 public safety, and as an alternative to incarceration1,5-8,15,18; therefore be it 36 37 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association study the use of chemical castration in 38 the treatment of incarcerated individuals with paraphilic disorders and for other individuals 39 who commit sexual offenses, including ethical concerns over coercion in its use as an 40 alternative to incarceration and in probation and parole proceedings.

RELEVANT AMA POLICY Court- Initiated Medical Treatment in Criminal Cases, E- 9.7.2 Court -initiated medical treatments raise important questions as to the rights of prisoners, the powers of judges, and the ethical obligations of physicians. Although convicted criminals have fewer rights and protections than other citizens, being convicted of a crime does not deprive an offender of all protections under the law. Court -ordered medical treatments raise the question whether professional ethics permits physicians to cooperate in administering and overseeing such treatment. Physicians have civic duties, but medical ethics do not require a physician to carry out civic duties that contradict fundamental principles of medical ethics, such as the duty to avoid doing harm. In limited circumstances physicians can ethically participate in court -initiated medical treatments. Individual physicians who provide care under court order should: (a) Participate only if the procedure being mandated is therapeutically efficacious and is therefore undoubt edly not a form of punishment or solely a mechanism of social control. (b) Treat patients based on sound medical diagnoses, not court -defined behaviors. While a court has the authority to identify criminal behavior, a court does not have the ability to make a medical diagnosis or to determine the type of treatment that will be administered. When the treatment involves in- patient therapy, surgical intervention, or pharmacological treatment, the physician's diagnosis must be confirmed by an Resolution: 501 (A-23) Page 4 of 5 independent physician or a panel of physicians not responsible to the state. A second opinion is not necessary in cases of court -ordered counseling or referrals for psychiatric evaluations. (c) Decline to provide treatment that is not scientifically validated and consistent with nationally accepted guidelines for clinical practice. (d) Be able to conclude, in good conscience and to the best of his or her professional judgment, that to the extent possible the patient voluntarily gave his or her informed consent, recognizing that an element of coercion that is inevitably present. When treatment involves in- patient therapy, surgical intervention, or pharmacological treatment, an independent physician or a panel of physicians not responsible to the state should confirm that voluntary consent was given. Issued: 2016 Informed Consent, E -2.1.1 Informed consent to medical treatment is fundamental in both ethics and law. Patients have the right to receive information and ask questions about recommended treatments so that they can make well - considered decisions about care. Successful communication in the patient -physician relationship fosters trust and supports shared decision making. The process of informed consent occurs when communication between a patient and physician results i n the patient's authorization or agreement to undergo a specific medical intervention. In seeking a patient's informed consent (or the consent of the patient's surrogate if the patient lacks decision- making capacity or declines to participate in making decisions), physicians should: (a) Assess the patient's ability to understand relevant medical information and the implications of treatment alternatives and to make an independent, voluntary decision. (b) Present relevant information accurately and sensitively, in keeping with the patient's preferences for receiving medical information. The physician should include information about: (i) the diagnosis (when known); (ii) the nature and purpose of recommended interventions; (iii) the burdens, risks, and expected benefits of all options, including forgoing treatment. (c) Document the informed consent conversation and the patient's (or surrogate's) decision in the medical record in some manner. When the patient/surrogate has provided specific written cons ent, the consent form should be included in the record. In emergencies, when a decision must be made urgently, the patient is not able to participate in decision making, and the patient's surrogate is not available, physicians may initiate treatment without prior informed consent. In such situations, the physician should inform the patient/surrogate at the earliest opportunity and obtain consent for ongoing treatment in keeping with these guidelines. Issued: 2016 Patient -Physician Relationships, E -1.1.1 The practice of medicine, and its embodiment in the clinical encounter between a patient and a physician, is fundamentally a moral activity that arises from the imperative to care for patients and to alleviate suffering. The relationship between a patient and a physician is based on trust, which gives rise to physicians' ethical responsibility to place patients' welfare above the physician's own self -interest or obligations to others, to use sound medical judgment on patients' behalf, and to advocate for thei r patients' welfare. A patient -physician relationship exists when a physician serves a patient's medical needs. Generally, the relationship is entered into by mutual consent between physician and patient (or surrogate). However, in certain circumstances a limited patient -physician relationship may be created without the patient's (or surrogate's) explicit agreement. Such circumstances include: (a) When a physician provides emergency care or provides care at the request of the patient's treating physician. In these circumstances, the patient's (or surrogate's) agreement to the relationship is implicit. (b) When a physician provides medically appropriate care for a prisoner under court order, in keeping with ethics guidance on court -initiated treat ment. (c) When a physician examines a patient in the context of an independent medical examination, in keeping with ethics guidance. In such situations, a limited patient -physician relationship exists. Issued: 2016 Resolution: 501 (A-23) Page 5 of 5 Standards of Care for Inmates of Corre ctional Facilities H -430.997 Our AMA believes that correctional and detention facilities should provide medical, psychiatric, and substance use disorder care that meets prevailing community standards, including appropriate referrals for ongoing care upon r elease from the correctional facility in order to prevent recidivism.

AMERICAN HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 502 (A-23) Introduced by: Medial Student Section Subject: Pain Management for Long- Acting Reversible Contraception and other Gynecological Procedures Referred to: Reference Committee E Whereas, A U.S. -based prospective study of over 9,256 women known as the Contraceptive 1 CHOICE Project showed that increasing access to long- acting reversible contraceptives 2 (LARC) will lead to a decrease in both unintended pregnancies and annual healthcare costs1; 3 and 4 5 Whereas, AMA policy H -75.987 supports a national goal of reducing unintended pregnancies 6 via counseling women of children bearing age on family planning and LARC use; and 7 8 Whereas, Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are between 99.6% and 99.9% effective as long- acting 9 reversible contraceptives and 99.9% effective as emergency contraceptives2,3; and 10 11 Whereas, The 2017- 2019 National Survey of Family Growth states that 10.4% of women age 12 15-49 in the United States use long -acting reversible contraceptives and use of LARCs has 13 risen five -fold in the last decade among women aged 15- 444,5; and 14 15 Whereas, Without the use of analgesics or anesthesia, nearly 89% of women report 16 moderate to severe pain during placement of a tenaculum, which precedes insertion of an 17 intrauterine device (IUD), removal of lost IUDs, as well as endometrial biopsy, uterine 18 aspiration, colposcopy, and hysteroscopy6; and 19 20 Whereas, A 2014 study found that, on a scale of 100, the mean patient maximum pain upon 21 IUD insertion was 64.8 compared to 35.3 rated by the physician, highlighting a discrepancy 22 between patients' experienced pain and providers' assumption of pain7; and 23 24 Whereas, Studies report that physicians often underestimate female pain and treat female 25 pain less extensively than male pain; consequently, physicians are less likely to recommend 26 analgesics and are more likely to recommend psychological treatment for female pain than 27 for male pain8-13; and 28 29 Whereas, In addition to LARC insertion procedures, a substantial portion of other gy necologic 30 procedures are routinely performed in offices and in clinics, including colposcopy with biopsy, 31 loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP), evacuation (D&E), saline infusion sonogram, and hysterosalpingogram, among 33 others under circumstances with limited validated options for analgesia14; and 34 35 Whereas, Local anesthesia, general anesthesia, and oral or intravenous sedation is 36 commonly used in vasectomy procedures for pain control and clear guidelines regarding use 37 of sedation or anesthesia for vasectomies are explicitly outlined in American Urological 38 Association clinical guidelines15; and 39 Resolution: 502 (A-23) Page 2 of 7 Whereas, Studies have shown that medical professionals hold false beliefs about Black 1 people feeling less pain, so that Black women stand to face compounded effects of racism 2 and sexism when seeking appropriate treatment for pain16; and 3 4 Whereas, Current research suggests that anticipated pain is correlated with increased 5 perceived pain throughout the duration of IUD insertion, especially in marginalized 6 populations17; and 7 8 Whereas, While studies have shown LARCs to be associated with high rates o f satisfaction 9 following insertion, this level of satisfaction is negatively impacted by pain experienced during 10 the procedure18; and 11 12 Whereas, Negative experiences related to gynecologic procedures may lead to patients 13 delaying otherwise routine gynecologic care, which can lead to preventable healthcare 14 inequities surrounding undiagnosed gynecological cancers, endometriosis, infections, 15 thereby impacting a patient's quality of life and potentially resulting in preventable death19; 16 and 17 18 Whereas, Multiple analgesic treatment regimens, including prophylactic NSAIDs, cervical 19 ripening, and topical cervical lidocaine, have been shown to prove inadequate analgesia prior 20 to IUD insertion, while intracervical lidocaine block and ketorolac injection have demonstrated 21 potential analgesic efficacy around the time of IUD insertion20-23; and 22 23 Whereas, Adequate management of postoperative pain after gynecologic procedures has 24 been associated with fewer postoperative hospital admissions24; and 25 26 Whereas, The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) acknowledges 27 that, of the patients that undergo IUD insertion, \"many report moderate to severe pain\" and 28 that more research is needed to identify effective options to reduce pain for IUD insertion25; 29 and 30 31 Whereas, ACOG specifically recommends that physicians consider analgesia or sedation for 32 women who are at higher risk for increased pain during IUD insertion, such as nulliparous 33 women, patients requiring cervical dilation, or patients who have had a past painful insertion 34 experience25; and 35 36 Whereas, Our American Medical Association endorses training physicians on adequate pain 37 control and urges for informed consent for other in -office procedures such as policy H- 69.945 38 \"Neonatal Male Circu mcision\", but does not have a policy that explicitly discusses pain 39 management for gynecological procedures; therefore be it 40 41 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association recognize the disparity in pain 42 management in gynecological procedures compared to procedures of similarly reported pain 43 and encourages discussion of pain control options, risks, and benefits with patients as a part of 44 the shared decision making process (New HOD Policy); and be it further 45 46 RESOLVED, That our AMA support further research into evidence- based anesthetic and 47 anxiolytic medication options for long- acting reversible contraception procedures and other 48 gynecological procedures, including but not limited to colposcopy, endometrial biopsy, and 49 LEEP procedures.

Managing Pain with Unintended Pregnancy H -75.987 Our AMA: (1) urges health care professionals to provide care for women of reproductive age, to assist them in planning for pregnancy and support age- appropriate education in esteem building, decision- making and family life in an effort to introduce the concept of planning for childbearing in the educational process; (2) supports reducing unintended pregnancies as a national goal; and (3) supports the training of all primary care physicians and relevant allied health professionals in the area of preconception counseling, including the recognition of long- acting reversible contraceptives as efficacious and economical forms of contraception. Citation: Res. 512, A -97; Reaffirmed: CSAPH Rep. 3, A- 07; Reaffirmation A -15; Appended: Res. 502, A - 15; Reaffirmation I -16; Pain Management H -410.950 Our AMA adopts the following guidelines on Invasive Pain Management Procedures for the Treatment of Chronic Pain, Including Procedures Using Fluoroscopy: Interventional chronic pain management means the diagnosis and treatment of pain- related disorders with the application of interventional techniques in managing sub- acute, chronic, persistent, and intractable pain. The practice of pain management includes comprehensive assessment of the patient, diagnosis of the cause of the patient's pain, evaluation of alternative treatment options, selection of appropriate treatment options, termination of prescribed treatment options when appropriate, follow -up care, the diagnosis and management of complications, and collaboration with other health care providers. Invasive pain management procedures include interventions throughout the course of diagnosing or treating pain which is chronic, persistent and intractable, or occurs outside of a surgical, obstetrical, or post- operative course of care. Invasive pain management techniques include: 1. ablation of targeted nerves; 2. procedures involving any portion of the spine, spinal cord, sympathetic nerves or block of major peripheral nerves, including percutaneous precision needle placement within the spinal column with placement of drugs such as local anesthetics, steroids, and analgesics, in the spinal column under fluoroscopic guidance or any other radiographic or imaging modality; and 3. surgical techniques, such as laser or endoscopic diskectomy, or placement of intrathecal infusion pumps, and/or spinal cord stimulators. At present, invasive pain management procedures do not include major joint injections (except sacroiliac injections), soft tissue injections or epidurals for surgical anesthesia or labor analgesia. When used for interventional pain management purposes such invasive pain management procedures do not consist solely of administration of anesthesia; rather, they are interactive procedures in which the physician is called upon to make continuing adjustments based on medical inference and judgments. In such instances, it is not the procedure itself, but the purpose and manner in which such procedures are utilized, that demand the ongoing application of direct and immediate medical judgment. These procedures are therefore within the practice of medicine, and should be performed only by physicians with appropriate training and credentialing. Invasive pain management procedures require physician- level training. However, certain technical aspects of invasive pain management procedures may be delegated to appropriately trained, licensed or certified, credentialed non- physicians under direct and/or personal supervision of a physician who possesses appropriate training and privileges in the performance of the procedure being supervised, and Resolution: 502 (A-23) Page 5 of 7 in compliance with local, state, and federal regulations. Invasive pain management procedures employing radiologic imaging are within the practice of medicine and should be performed only by physicians with appropriate training and credentialing. Citation: (BOT Rep. 16, A -13) Coverage of Contraceptives by Insurance H -180.958 1. Our AMA supports federal and state efforts to require that every prescription drug benefit plan include coverage of prescription contraceptives. 2. Our AMA supports full coverage, without patient cost -sharing, of all contraception without regard to prescription or over -the-counter utilization because all contraception is essential preventive health care. Citation: Res. 221, A -98; Reaffirmation A -04; Reaffirmed: CMS Rep. 1, A -14; I -17; BOT Rep. 10, A -18; Preconception Care H -425.976 1. Our AMA supports the 10 recommendations developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for improving preconception health care that state: (1) Individual responsibility across the lifespan--each woman, man, and couple should be encouraged to have a reproductive life plan; (2) Consumer awareness --increase public awarenes s of the importance of preconception health behaviors and preconception care services by using information and tools appropriate across various ages; literacy, including health literacy; and cultural/linguistic contexts; (3) Preventive visits --as a part of primary care visits, provide risk assessment and educational and health promotion counseling to all women of childbearing age to reduce reproductive risks and improve pregnancy outcomes; (4) Interventions for identified risks --increase the proportion of w omen who receive interventions as follow -up to preconception risk screening, focusing on high priority interventions (i.e., those with evidence of effectiveness and greatest potential impact); (5) Inter -conception care--use the inter -conception period to provide additional intensive interventions to women who have had a previous pregnancy that ended in an adverse outcome (i.e., infant death, fetal loss, birth defects, low birth weight, or preterm birth); (6) Pre -pregnancy checkup --offer, as a component of maternity care, one pre- pregnancy visit for couples and persons planning pregnancy; (7) Health insurance coverage for women with low incomes --increase public and private health insurance coverage for women with low incomes to improve access to preventive wo men's health and pre- conception and inter -conception care; (8) Public health programs and strategies --integrate components of pre- conception health into existing local public health and related programs, including emphasis on inter -conception interventions for women with previous adverse outcomes; (9) Research--increase the evidence base and promote the use of the evidence to improve preconception health; and (10) Monitoring improvements --maximize public health surveillance and related research mechanisms t o monitor preconception health. 2. Our AMA supports the education of physicians and the public about the importance of preconception care as a vital component of a woman's reproductive health. 3. Our AMA supports the use of pregnancy intention screening and contraceptive screening in appropriate women and men as part of routine well -care and recommend it be appropriately documented in the medical record. Citation: Res. 414, A -06; Reaffirmation I -07; Reaffirmed: CSAPH Rep. 01, Res A - 19; Neonatal Male Circumcision H -60.945 1. Our AMA: (a) encourages training programs for pediatricians, obstetricians, and family physicians to incorporate information on the use of local pain control techniques for neonatal circumcision; (b) supports the general principles of the 2012 Circumcision Policy Statement of the American Academy of Pediatrics, which reads as follows: \"Evaluation of current evidence indicates that the health benefits of newborn male circumcision outweigh the risks and that the procedure's benefits justify access to this procedure for Resolution: 502 (A-23) Page 6 of 7 families who choose it. Specific benefits identified included prevention of urinary tract infections, penile cancer, and transmission of some sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.\" and (c) urges that as part of the informed consent discussion, the risks and benefits of pain control techniques for circumcision be thoroughly discussed to aid parents in making their decisions. 2. Our AMA encourages state Medicaid reimbursement of neonatal male circumcision. Citation: (CSA Rep. 10, I -09; Modified: Res. 503, A -13) E2.1.1 Informed Consent Informed consent to medical treatment is fundamental in both ethics and law. Patients have the right to receive information and ask questions about recommended treatments so that they can make well - considered decisions about care. Successful communication in the patient -physician relationship fosters trust and supports shared decision making. The process of informed consent o ccurs when communication between a patient and physician results in the patient's authorization or agreement to undergo a specific medical intervention. In seeking a patient's informed consent (or the consent of the patient's surrogate if the patient lacks decision- making capacity or declines to participate in making decisions), physicians should: (a) Assess the patient's ability to understand relevant medical information and the implications of treatment alternatives and to make an independent, voluntary decision. (b) Present relevant information accurately and sensitively, in keeping with the patient's preferences for receiving medical information. The physician should include information about: (i) the diagnosis (when known); (ii) the nature and purpose of recommended interventions; (iii) the burdens, risks, and expected benefits of all options, including forgoing treatment. (c) Document the informed consent conversation and the patient's (or surrogate's) decision in the medical record in some manner. When the patient/surrogate has provided specific written consent, the consent form should be included in the record. In emergencies, when a decision must be made urgently, the patient is not able to participate in decision making, and the patient's surrogate is not available, physicians may initiate treatment without prior informed consent . In such situations, the physician should inform the patient/surrogate at the earliest opportunity and obtain consent for ongoing treatment in keeping with these guidelines. Issued: 2016 Pain as the Fifth Vital Sign D -450.956 Our AMA will: (1) work with The Joint Commission to promote evidence- based, functional and effective pain assessment and treatment measures for accreditation standards; (2) strongly support timely and appropriate access to non- opioid and non- pharmacologic treatments for pain, including removing barriers to such treatments when they inhibit a patient's access to care; (3) advocate that pain as the fifth vital sign be eliminated from professional standards and usage; and (4) advocate for the removal of the pain management component of patient satisfaction surveys as it pertains to payment and quality metrics. Citation: BOT Rep. 19, A -16; Reaffirmation: A -19; H-515.952 Adverse Childhood Exp eriences and Trauma- Informed Care Adverse Childhood Experiences and Trauma -Informed Care H -515.952 1. Our AMA recognizes trauma- informed care as a practice that recognizes the widespread impact of trauma on patients, identifies the signs and symptoms of trauma, and treats patients by fully integrating knowledge about trauma into policies, procedures, and practices and seeking to avoid re- traumatization. 2. Our AMA supports: a. evidence- based primary prevention strategies for Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs); b. evidence- based trauma- informed care in all medical settings that focuses on the prevention of poor health and life outcomes after ACEs or other trauma at any time in life occurs; c. efforts for data collection, research, and evaluation of cost -effective ACEs screening tools without additional burden for physicians. d. efforts to educate physicians about the facilitators, barriers and best practices for providers implementing ACEs screening and trauma- informed care approaches into a cl inical setting; and e. funding for schools, behavioral and mental health services, professional groups, community, and government agencies to support patients with ACEs or trauma at any time in life; and f. increased screening for ACEs in medical settings, in recognition of the intersectionality of ACEs with Resolution: 502 (A-23) Page 7 of 7 significant increased risk for suicide, negative substance use- related outcomes including overdose, and a multitude of downstream negative health outcomes. 3. Our AMA supports the inclusion of ACEs and trauma -informed care into undergraduate and graduate medical education curricula. Citation: Res. 504, A -19; Appended: CSAPH Rep. 3, A -21; AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 503 (A-23) Introduced by: Medical Student Section Subject: Increasing Diversity in Stem Cell Biobanks and Disease Models Referred to: Reference Committee E Whereas, Despite racial and ethnic minorities composing almost 40% of the U.S. population, 1 most biomedical and clinical research uses a largely homogenous population that is usually 2 79.7% White, with 98% of over 10,000 NIH -funded cancer clinical trials not meeting NIH's 3 own criteria and goals for minority participation1-3; and 4 5 Whereas, A principal component analysis of embryonic stem cell lines from the 1000 6 Genomes Project discovered 93 percent of 143 sequenced human embryonic stem cell lines 7 clustered with reference samples of European ancestry4; and 8 9 Whereas, An analysis of 555 completed stem cell clinical trials showed only 45% 10 documented information regarding patients' race and ethnicity, of which, Native American or 11 Alaskan, Black, and Multiracial groups were underrepresented when compared to U.S. 12 population data5; and 13 14 Whereas, Given that 72.6% of induced pluripotent stem cell lines (iPSCs) are Caucasian in 15 origin, there is limited availability of racially and ethnically diverse iPSC biobanks and patient - 16 derived disease models5-7; and 17 18 Whereas, The availability of diverse iPSC lines has not kept pace with advances in iPSC 19 disease models and technologies, leading to biased insights on disease mechanisms, 20 disease susceptibility, and drug responses in population- specific genetic variants7-11; and 21 22 Whereas, The history of research involving minorities has included questionable and harmful 23 actions, such as the 1932 Tuskegee Syphilis Study, resulting in a greater unwillingness 24 among minorities to participate in research studies12,13; and 25 26 Whereas, Recruitment materials used in U.S. biobanks are predominantly in English and 27 above a fifth- grade reading level, limiting participation by underrepresented populations14; 28 and 29 30 Whereas, Biobank recruitment strategies are often convenience- based, with hospital -based 31 researchers recruiting patients not representative of those most afflicted by disease12; and 32 33 Whereas, Exclusion criteria in clinical trials often leads to participants with characteristics that 34 are skewed, and the unnecessary exclusion of participants (e.g. non- English speakers, 35 people with mental and physical disabilities), that better represent the actual demographic 36 after treatment approval15,16; and 37 Resolution: 503 (A-23) Page 2 of 6 Whereas, Lack of diverse iPSC models for drug toxicity assessments fails to account for 1 variations in metabolic activity, which leads to higher rates of adverse events in minority 2 populations, resulting in patient harm and waste of resources9,17; and 3 4 Whereas, Existing studies investigating the diversity of stem cell research encompass only 5 major racial and ethnic groups (e.g. Asian or Latino), despite health disparities existing 6 among specific subgroups (e.g. Cambodian or Colombian)6,18; and 7 8 Whereas, An initiative by California's Stem Cell Agency addresses gaps in the diversity of 9 stem cell lines through its publicly accessible iPSC Repository, with 2,600 iPSCs lines 10 inclusive of minority populations including African, Hispanic, Native American, and East and 11 South Asian populations19; and 12 13 Whereas, The NIH -sponsored All of Us Research Program endorses diversity as a core 14 value and aims to build one of the largest diverse biobanks20; and 15 16 Whereas, Our American Medical Association supports the Diversity Trials Ac t that strives to 17 ensure clinical trials focus on diseases disproportionately impacting underrepresented 18 populations to discover scientific advances benefiting all communities21; and 19 20 Whereas, A recent study from the Stanford University Center for Biomedic al Ethics (SCBE) 21 recommends that reviewers and editors give priority to manuscripts that have significant 22 minority group representation and to those that replicate prior studies that were primarily 23 focused on White populations22,23; and 24 25 Whereas, A recent study SCBE recommends that race and/or ethnicity be included as 26 variables in experiments requiring the use of stem cell lines such that potentially variable 27 outcomes of intervention between racial or ethnic groups can be assessed23,24; and 28 29 Whereas, Our AMA is committed to supporting stem cell research and its diversification 30 through a number of methodologies, as described in H -460.911, H -460.915, H -460.889, H - 31 460.924, and 7.3.8 Research with Stem Cells24-26; therefore be it 32 33 RESOLVED, That o ur American Medical Association encourage research institutions and 34 stakeholders to re -evaluate recruitment strategies and materials to encourage participation 35 by underrepresented populations (New HOD Policy); and it be further 36 37 RESOLVED, That our AMA amend Policy H -460.915, \"Cloning and Stem Cell Research,\" by 38 addition to read as follows: 39 40 Cloning and Stem Cell Research, H -460.915 41 Our AMA: (1) supports biomedical research on multipotent 42 stem cells (including adult and cord blood stem cells); (2) urges 43 the use of stem cell lines from different ethnicities in disease 44 models ; (2)(3) supports the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer 45 technology in biomedical research (therapeutic cloning); (3)(4) 46 opposes the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer technology for 47 the specific purpose of producing a human child (reproductive 48 cloning); (4)(5) encourages strong public support of federal 49 Resolution: 503 (A-23) Page 3 of 6 funding for research involving human pluripotent stem cells and 1 (5)(6) will continue to monitor developments in stem cell 2 research and the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer 3 technology (Modify Current HOD Policy) ; and be it further 4 5 RESOLVED, That our AMA strongly encourage institutional biobanks to collect racially and 6 ethnically diverse samples such that future induced pluripotent stem cell disease models 7 better represent the population.

Accessed August 29, 2021. https://policysearch.ama - assn.org/policyfinder/detail/minority%20research?uri=%2FAMADoc%2FHOD.xml -0-4159.xml RELEVANT AMA POLICY Increasing Minority, Female, and other Underrepresented Group Participation in Clinical Research H-460.911 1. Our AMA advocates that: a. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct annual surveillance of clinical trials by gender, race, and ethnicity, including consideration of pediatric and elderly populations, to determine if proportionate representation of women and minorities is maintained in terms of enrollment and retention. This surveillance effort should be modeled after Natio nal Institute of Health guidelines on the inclusion of women and minority populations. b. The FDA have a page on its web site that details the prevalence of minorities and women in its clinical trials and its efforts to increase their enrollment and parti cipation in this research; and c. Resources be provided to community level agencies that work with those minorities, females, and other underrepresented groups who are not proportionately represented in clinical trials to address issues of lack of access, distrust, and lack of patient awareness of the benefits of trials in their health care. These minorities include Black Individuals/African Americans, Hispanics, Asians/Pacific Islanders/Native Hawaiians, and Native Americans. 2. Our AMA recommends the fol lowing activities to the FDA in order to ensure proportionate representation of minorities, females, and other underrepresented groups in clinical trials: a. Increased fiscal support for community outreach programs; e.g., culturally relevant community educ ation, community leaders' support, and listening to community's needs; b. Increased outreach to all physicians to encourage recruitment of patients from underrepresented groups in clinical trials; c. Continued education for all physicians and physicians -in-training on clinical trials, subject recruitment, subject safety, and possible expense reimbursements, and that this education encompass discussion of barriers that currently constrain appropriate recruitment of underrepresented groups and methods for inc reasing trial accessibility for patients; d. Support for the involvement of minority physicians in the development of partnerships between minority communities and research institutions; and e. Fiscal support for minority, female, and other underrepresented groups recruitment efforts and increasing trial accessibility. 3. Our AMA advocates that specific results of outcomes in all clinical trials, both pre- and post -FDA approval, are to be determined for all subgroups of gender, race and ethnicity, including consideration of pediatric and elderly populations; and that these results are included in publication and/or freely distributed, whether or not subgroup differences exist.

Citation: CSAPH Rep. 01, A -19; E-7.3.8 Research with Stem Cells Human stem cells are widely seen as offering a source of potential treatment for a range of diseases and are thus the subject of much research . Clinical studies have validated the use of adult stem cells in a limited number of therapies, but have yet to confirm the utility of embryonic stem cells . Physicians who conduct research using stem cells obtained from any source (established tissue, umbilical cord blood, or embryos) must, at a minimum: (a) Adhere to institutional review board (IRB) requirements. (b) Ensure that the research is carried out with appropriate oversight and monitoring. (c) Ensure that the research is carried out with appropriate informed consent. In addition to disclosure of research risks and potential benefits, at minimum, the consent disclosure should address: (i) for a donor of cells to be used in stem cell research : a. the process by which stem cells will be obtained; b. what specifically will be done with the stem cells ; c. whether an immortal cell line will result; and d. the primary and anticipated secondary uses of donated embryos and/or derived stem cells , including potential commercial uses. (ii) for a recipient of stem cells in clinical research : a. the types of tissue from which the stem cells derive (e.g., established tissue, umbilical cord blood, or embryos); and b. unique risks posed by investigational stem cell products (when applicable), such as tumorigenesis, immunological reactions, unpredictable behavior of cells , and unknown long- term health effects. The professional community as well as the public remains divided about the use of embryonic stem cells for either research or therapeutic purposes. The conflict regarding research with embryonic stem cells centers on the moral status of embryos, a question that divides ethical opinion and that cannot be resolved by medical science. Regardless whether they are obtained from embryos donated by individuals or couples undergoing in vitro fertilization, or from cloned embryos created by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), use of embryonic stem cells currently requires the destruction of the human embryo from which the stem cells derive. The pluralism of moral visions that underlies this debate must be respected. Participation in research involving embryonic stem cells requires respect for embryos, research participants, donors, and recipients. Embryonic stem cell research does not violate the ethical standards of the profession. Every physician remains free to decide whether to participate in stem cell research or to use its products. Physicians should co ntinue to be guided by their commitment to the welfare of patients and the advancement of medical science. Physicians who conduct research using embryonic stem cells should be able to justify greater risks for subjects, and the greater respect due embryos than stem cells from other sources, based on expectations that the research offers substantial promise of contributing significantly to scientific or therapeutic knowledge. Issued: 2016 Race and Ethnicity as Variables in Medical Research H -460.924 Our AMA policy is that: (1) race and ethnicity are valuable research variables when used and interpreted appropriately; (2) health data be collected on patients, by race and ethnicity, in hospitals, managed care organizations, independent practice associations, and other large insurance organizations; (3) physicians recognize that race and ethnicity are conceptually distinct; (4) our AMA supports research into the use of methodologies that allow for multiple racial and ethnic self -designations by research participants; (5) our Resolution: 503 (A-23) Page 6 of 6 AMA encourages investigators to recognize the limitations of all current methods for classifying race and ethnic groups in all medical studies by stating explicitly how race and/or ethnic taxonomies were developed or selected; (6) our AMA enc ourages appropriate organizations to apply the results from studies of race- ethnicity and health to the planning and evaluation of health services; and (7) our AMA continues to monitor developments in the field of racial and ethnic classification so that i t can assist physicians in interpreting these findings and their implications for health care for patients.

DOI:10.1001/JAMA.2023.5321 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 505 (A-23) Introduced by: Medical Student Section Subject: Improving Access to Opioid Antagonists for Vulnerable and Underserved Populations Referred to: Reference Committee E Whereas, In the United States, the opioid epidemic is a growing health crisis and has been 1 declared a public health emergency1; and 2 3 Whereas, Natural opioids are derived from the poppy plant, such as morphine and codeine, 4 while synthetic opioids are artificially synthesized such as fentanyl, carfentanil, and 5 methadone2; and 6 7 Whereas, Natural and synthetic opioid overdose -related deaths are a significant cause of 8 death in the U.S., contributing to more than 100,000 deaths from April 2020 to April 2021, a 9 28.5% increase from the year prior3,4; and 10 11 Whereas, Naloxone is a competitive antagonist with a high affinity for the mu- opioid receptor 12 that can reverse opioid- induced respiratory depression and rescue opioid overdose, with a 13 half-life of 30 to 120 minutes5; and 14 15 Whereas, The widespread distribution and use of naloxone has been shown to decr ease 16 opioid overdose- related deaths without significantly increasing the incidence of opioid use6-8; 17 and 18 19 Whereas, Naloxone may precipitate withdrawal, which can lead to physical and psychological 20 side effects for the patient, including mood changes, which may adversely affect bystanders 21 or medical staff9,10; and 22 23 Whereas, The need for large or repeated doses of naloxone to reverse synthetic opioid 24 overdose further complicates medical management, adding to healthcare worker stress, 25 especially in times of shortage11; and 26 27 Whereas, Patients who overdosed on fentanyl -adulterated opioid tablets who received 28 naloxone had recurrence of respiratory depression beyond the standard observation period 29 for opioid overdose12; and 30 31 Whereas, Synthetic opioids have an increased potency compared to natural opioids, which 32 frequently necessitates higher initial dosing or additional administrations to rescue respiratory 33 depression in the setting of overdose13-15; and 34 35 Whereas, It has been estimated that nearly 80% of fatal opioid- related overdose deaths 36 involved synthetic opioids16; and 37 Resolution: 505 (A-23) Page 2 of 11 Whereas, Between 2013 and 2019, synthetic opioid overdose -related deaths increased 1 1,040%, with more than 55,000 deaths related to synthetic opioid overdose in 2020 alone17-2 19; and 3 4 Whereas, A multi- agency meeting was held in 2019 to discuss the threat of synthetic opioids 5 and urge the development of drugs aimed at rescuing respiratory depression and overdose 6 caused by synthetic opioids specifically; among those present were representatives from the 7 National Institutes of Health (NIH), the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, 8 the National Institute of Drug Abuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Chemical 9 Countermeasures Research Program, the Biomedical Advanced Res earch and Development 10 Authority, and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency20; and 11 12 Whereas, Respiratory stimulant drugs such as hypothalamic hormones, nicotinic receptor 13 agonists, ampakines, serotonin agonists, antioxidants, and potassium channel blockers have 14 been used in animal studies to reverse opioid- induced respiratory depression as alternatives 15 to naloxone, but require further study before safe clinical use11,21,22; and 16 17 Whereas, Preliminary studies of nalmefene, a mu- opioid receptor antagonist more potent 18 than narcan, have shown potential reversal of opioid- induced respiratory depression22; and 19 20 Whereas, Experimental drugs such as methocinnamox, an opioid receptor antagonist, have 21 been shown to prevent respiratory depression following heroin exposure in Rhesus monkeys, 22 but have not yet reached clinical trials23; and 23 24 Whereas, Approximately 1 in 4 women on Medicaid were prescribed opioids during 25 pregnancy24; and 26 27 Whereas, This high level of opioid use during pregnancy correlates with increased incidence 28 of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) among babies, which is a group of psychological 29 and neurobehavioral signs of withdrawal that may occur in a newborn exposed to opioids or 30 psychotropic substances in utero that between 50% to 80% of infants exposed to opioids in 31 utero will develop24,25; and 32 33 Whereas, Barriers to treatment for pregnant women with opioid use disorder (OUD) include 34 legal consequences, shame associated with opioids, and misinformation among healthcare 35 professionals resulting in reluctance to provide care25; and 36 37 Whereas, The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends 38 screening for substance use as a part of comprehensive obstetric care, and further 39 recommends that screening should be done at the first prenatal visit universally for all 40 patients26; and 41 42 Whereas, The American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry (AAAP) supports voluntary 43 screening of pregnant women for substance use disorders for the purpose of providing 44 prenatal care and treatment to mother and f etus27; and 45 46 Whereas, Universal screening rather than targeted or risk -based screening, as targeted 47 screening can be influenced by negative stereotyping, and may disproportionately target 48 marginalized communities29; and 49 Resolution: 505 (A-23) Page 3 of 11 Whereas, A large systematic review of non -randomized trials found that take- home naloxone 1 programs have led to improved survival rates among program participants and reduced 2 opioid overdose mortality rates in the community, and are accompanied by only a low rate of 3 adverse events28; and 4 5 Whereas, The rate of opioid overdose -related inpatient stays in rural areas increased 76.3% 6 between 2010 and 201730; and 7 8 Whereas, The rate of overdose deaths involving opioids among American Indian and Alaskan 9 Natives increased from 2.2 deaths per 100,000 individuals in 2000 to 13.7 deaths per 10 100,000 individuals in 201631; and 11 12 Whereas, A recent systematic review illustrated the need to manage opioid use disorder 13 (OUD) in rural American Indian / Alaskan Native communities with harm reduction education 14 and medication assisted treatment32; and 15 16 Whereas, The United States Department of Health and Human Services identifies naloxone 17 distribution as a top harm -reduction strategy for addressing the opioid epidemic33; and 18 19 Whereas, Recent studies of naloxone access in rural areas have identified common barriers, 20 including cost, distance to clinics and providers, stigma felt by customers asking for 21 naloxone, and unawareness of current state -specific standing- order laws34-37; and 22 23 Whereas, Medicare Part D, the largest single payer of naloxone prescriptions in the United 24 States, dispensed naloxone at a rate of 4.9 per 1000 enrollees compared to 2.9 per 1000 25 enrollees in non- metropolitan areas, suggesting a growing disparity in naloxone availability in 26 rural areas38; and 27 28 Whereas, A CDC's August 2019 Vital Signs report noted that the amount of naloxone 29 dispensed is 25 times greater in the highest -dispensing counties compared to the lowest - 30 dispensing counties, and that rural counties in the United States are 3 times more likely to be 31 a low -dispensing county than in metropolitan areas39; and 32 33 Whereas, A study found Arizona was the only state that had enough naloxone availability to 34 prevent 80% of witnessed overdoses in 201740; and 35 36 Whereas, Stigma towards drug use in public pharmacy spaces - including fear of naloxone 37 customers being stereotyped as an \"addict\" and discomfort of pharmacy staff introducing the 38 subject of naloxone - is a recurrent finding in studies examining challenges of naloxone 39 distribution37,41 -43; and 40 41 Whereas, The stigmatization of purchasing medications may be reduced with telehealth and 42 mail- order options for naloxone prescription and delivery,44; and 43 44 Whereas, Numerous studies, models, and systematic reviews of the literature have 45 demonstrated take- home naloxone programs reduce opioid overdose mortality45-51; and 46 47 Whereas, Our American Medical Association supports legal use of naloxone regardless of 48 prescription status (H -95.932); and 49 Resolution: 505 (A-23) Page 4 of 11 Whereas, O ur AMA already has clear policy ( H-420.950 and H -420.962) a ddressing the key 1 legal, ethic and social concerns around substance use disorder in pregnancy and perinatal 2 addiction, but lacks policy specifically supporting universal screening for opioid use as a tool 3 to combat substance use disorder in pregnancy; and 4 5 Whereas, AMA policy advocates for the prevention of drug -related overdose (D -95.987) and 6 general opioid mitigation (D- 95.964), but does not explicitly address the growing concern of 7 synthetic opioids nor the limitations of naloxone; therefore be it 8 9 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association amend Policy H -95.932, \"Increasing 10 Availability of Naloxone\", by addition to read as follows: 11 12 Increasing Availability of Naloxone H -95.932 13 1. Our AMA supports legislative, regulatory, and national 14 advocacy efforts to increase access to affordable naloxone, 15 including but not limited to collaborative practice agreements 16 with pharmacists and standing orders for pharmacies and, 17 where permitted by law, community -based organizations, law 18 enforcement agencies, correctional settings, schools, and other 19 locations that do not restrict the route of administration for 20 naloxone delivery. 21 2. Our AMA supports efforts that enable law enforcement 22 agencies to carry and administer naloxone. 23 3. Our AMA encourages physicians to co- prescribe naloxone to 24 patients at risk of overdose and, where permitted by law, to the 25 friends and family members of such patients. 26 4. Our AMA encourages private and public payers to include all 27 forms of naloxone on their preferred drug lists and formularies 28 with minimal or no cost sharing. 29 5. Our AMA supports liability protections for physicians and 30 other healthcare professionals and others who are authorized 31 to prescribe, dispense and/or administer naloxone pursuant to 32 state law. 33 6. Our AMA supports efforts to encourage individuals who are 34 authorized to administer naloxone to receive appropriate 35 education to enable them to do so effectively. 36 7. Our AMA encourages manufacturers or other qualified 37 sponsors to pursue the application process for over the counter 38 approval of naloxone with the Food and Drug Administration. 39 8. Our AMA supports the widespread implementation of easily 40 accessible Naloxone rescue stations (public availability of 41 Naloxone through wall -mounted display/storage units that also 42 include instructions) throughout the country following 43 distribution and legislative edicts similar to those for Automated 44 External Defibrillators. 45 9. Our AMA supports the legal access to and use of naloxone 46 in all public spaces regardless of whether the individual holds a 47 prescription. 48 10. Our AMA supports efforts to increase the availability, 49 delivery, possession and use of mail- order naloxone to help 50 Resolution: 505 (A-23) Page 5 of 11 prevent opioid- related overdose, especially in underserved 1 communities and American Indian reservations. (Modify 2 Current HOD Policy) 3 and be it further 4 5 RESOLVED, That our AMA amend Policy H -420.950, \"Substance Use Disorders During 6 Pregnancy\" by addition to read as follows: 7 8 Substance Use Disorders During Pregnancy H -420.950 9 Our AMA will: (1) oppose any efforts to imply that the diagnosis 10 of substance use disorder during pregnancy represents child 11 abuse; (2) support legislative and other appropriate efforts for 12 the expansion and improved access to evidence -based 13 treatment for substance use disorders during pregnancy; (3) 14 oppose the removal of infants from their mothers solely based 15 on a single positive prenatal drug screen without appropriate 16 evaluation; and (4) advocate for appropriate medical evaluation 17 prior to the removal of a child, which takes into account (a) the 18 desire to preserve the individual's family structure, (b) the 19 patient's treatment status, and (c) current impairment status 20 when substance use is suspected, and (5) support universal 21 opioid use screenings at prenatal care visits with early 22 intervention, comprehensive naloxone use education and 23 distribution for those who screen positive and following 24 overdose- related emergency department visits . (Modify Current 25 HOD Po licy) 26 and be it further 27 28 RESOLVED, That our AMA amend D -95.987 , \"Prevention of Drug -Related Overdose\" by 29 addition to read as follows : 30 31 Prevention of Drug- Related Overdose D -95.987 32 1. Our AMA: (a) recognizes the great burden that substance 33 use disorders (SUDs) and drug -related overdoses and death 34 places on patients and society alike and reaffirms its support for 35 the compassionate treatment of patients with a SUD and 36 people who use drugs; (b) urges that community -based 37 programs offering naloxone and other opioid overdose and 38 drug safety and prevention services continue to be 39 implemented in order to further develop best practices in this 40 area; (c) encourages the education of health care workers and 41 people who use drugs about the use of naloxone and other 42 harm reduction measures in preventing opioid and other drug- 43 related overdose fatalities; and (d) will continue to monitor the 44 progress of such initiatives and respond as appropriate. 45 2.Our AMA will: (a) advocate for the appropriate education of 46 at-risk patients and their caregivers in the signs and symptoms 47 of a drug - related overdose; and (b) support the development of 48 adjuncts and alternatives to naloxone to combat synthetic 49 opioid- induced respiratory depression and overdose; and (c) 50 Resolution: 505 (A-23) Page 6 of 11 encourage the continued study and implementation of 1 appropriate treatments and risk mitigation methods for patients 2 at risk for a drug- related overdose. 3 3. Our AMA will support the development and implementation of 4 appropriate education programs for persons receiving treatment 5 for a SUD or in recovery from a SUD and their friends/families that 6 address harm reduction measures. 7 4. Our AMA will advocate for and encourage state and county 8 medical societies to advocate for harm reduction policies that 9 provide civil and criminal immunity for the possession, distribution, 10 and use of \"drug paraphernalia\" designed for harm reduction from 11 drug use, including but not limited to drug contamination testing 12 and injection drug preparation, use, and disposal supplies. 13 5. Our AMA will implement an education program for patients with 14 substance use disorder and their family/caregivers to increase 15 understanding of the increased risk of adverse outcomes 16 associated with having a substance use disorder and a serious 17 respiratory illness such as COVID -19. 18 6. Our AMA supports efforts to increase access to fentanyl test 19 strips and other drug checking supplies for purposes of harm 20 reduction.

Citation: BOT Rep. 09, I -19; Treating Opioid Use Disorder in Hospitals D -95.967 1. Our AMAs Opioid Task Force will work together with the American Hospital Association and other relevant organizations to identify best practices that are being used by hospitals and others to treat opioid use disorder as a chronic disease, including identifying patients with this condition; initiating or providing opioid agonist or partial agonist inpatient, obstetric and emergency department settings; providi ng cognitive and behavioral therapy as well as other counseling as appropriate; establishing appropriate discharge plans, including education about opioid use disorder; and participating in community -wide systems of care for patients and families affected by this chronic medical disease. 2. Our AMA will advocate for states to evaluate programs that currently exist or have received federal or state funding to assist physicians, hospitals and their communities to coordinate care for patients with the chronic disease of opioid use disorder. 3. Our AMA will take all necessary steps to seek clarification of interpretations of 21 CFR 1306.07 by the DEA and otherwise seek administrative, statutory and regulatory solutions that will allow for (a) prescribers with the waiver permitting the prescribing of buprenorphine for opioid use disorder to be able to do so, when indicated, for hospitalized inpatients, using a physician order rather than an outpatient prescription, and (b) hospital inpatient pharmacies to be able to fill such authorizations by prescribers without this constituting a violation of federal regulations. Citation: Res. 223, A -18; Prevention of Drug- Related Overdose D -95.987 1. Our AMA: (a) recognizes the great burden that substance use disorders (SUDs) and drug- related overdoses and death places on patients and society alike and reaffirms its support for the compassionate treatment of patients with a SUD and people who use drugs; (b) urges that community -based programs offering naloxone and other opioid overdose and drug safety and prevention services continue to be implemented in order to further develop best practices in this area; (c) encourages the education of health care workers and people who use drugs about the use of naloxone and other harm reduction measures in preventing opioid and other drug- related overdose fatalities; and (d) will continue to monitor the progress of such initiatives and respond as appropriate. 2.Our AMA will: (a) advocate for the appropriate education of at -risk patients and their caregivers in the signs and symptoms of a drug- related overdose; and (b) encourage the continued study and implementation of appropriate treatments and risk mitigation methods for patients at risk for a drug-related overdose. Resolution: 505 (A-23) Page 9 of 11 3. Our AMA will support the development and implementation of appropriate education programs for persons receiving treatment for a SUD or in recovery from a SUD and their friends/families that address harm reduction measures. 4. Our AMA will advocate for and encourage state and county medical societies to advocate for harm reduction policies that provide civil and criminal immunity for the possession, distribution, and use of \"drug paraphernalia\" designed for harm reduction from drug use, including but not limited to drug contami nation testing and injection drug preparation, use, and disposal supplies. 5. Our AMA will implement an education program for patients with substance use disorder and their family/caregivers to increase understanding of the increased risk of adverse outcomes associated with having a substance use disorder and a serious respiratory illness such as COVID -19. 6. Our AMA supports efforts to increase access to fentanyl test strips and other drug checking supplies for purposes of harm reduction.

Our AMA endorses: (a) the medical treatment model of employing medications for opioid use disorder (OUD) as the standard of care for persons with OUD who are incarcerated; and (b) medications for persons with OUD who are incarcerated, an endorsement in collaboration with relevant organizations including but not limited to the American Soci ety of Addiction Medicine and the American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry. 2. Our AMA advocates for legislation, standards, policies and funding that require correctional facilities to increase access to evidence- based treatment of OUD, including initiat ion and continuation of medications for OUD, in conjunction with psychosocial treatment when desired by the person with OUD, in correctional facilities within the United States and that this apply to all individuals who are incarcerated, including individu als who are pregnant, postpartum, or parenting. 3. Our AMA advocates for legislation, standards, policies, and funding that require correctional facilities within the United States to work in ongoing collaboration with addiction treatment physician- led te ams, case managers, social workers, and pharmacies in the communities where patients, including individuals who are pregnant, postpartum, or parenting, are released to offer post -incarceration treatment plans for Resolution: 505 (A-23) Page 10 of 11 OUD, including education, medication for addiction treatment and counseling, and medication for preventing overdose deaths, including naloxone (or any other medication that is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of an opioid overdose), and help ensure post - incarceration medical coverage and accessibility to mental health and substance use disorder treatments, that include medication and behavioral health and social supports for addiction treatment. 4. Our AMA advocates for all correctional facilities to use a validated screening tool to identify opioid withdrawal and take steps to determine potential need for treatment for OUD and opioid withdrawal syndrome for all persons upon entry. Citation: Res. 443, A -05; Reaffirmed: CSAPH Rep. 1, -17; Modified: Res. 503, A -21; Substance Use Disorders During Pregnancy H -420.950 Our AMA will: (1) oppose any efforts to imply that the diagnosis of substance use disorder during pregnancy represents child abuse; (2) support legislative and other appropriate efforts for the expansion and improved access to evidence- based treatment for substance use disorders during pregnancy; (3) oppose the removal of infants from their mothers solely based on a single positive prenatal drug screen without appropriate evaluation; and (4) advocate for appropriate medical evaluation prior to the removal of a child, which takes into account (a) the desire to preserve the individual's family structure, (b) the patient's treatment status, and (c) current impairment status when substance use is suspected. Citation: Res. 209, A -18; Modified: Res. 520, A -19; Perinatal Addiction - Issues in Care and Prevention H -420.962 Our AMA: (1) adopts the following statement: Transplacental drug transfer should not be subject to criminal s anctions or civil liability; (2) encourages the federal government to expand the proportion of funds allocated to drug treatment, prevention, and education. In particular, support is crucial for establishing and making broadly available specialized treatment programs for drug- addicted pregnant and breastfeeding women wherever possible; (3) urges the federal government to fund additional research to further knowledge about and effective treatment programs for drug- addicted pregnant and breastfeeding women, encourages also the support of research that provides long- term follow -up data on the developmental consequences of perinatal drug exposure, and identifies appropriate methodologies for early intervention with perinatally exposed children; (4) reaffirms the following statement: Pregnant and breastfeeding patients with substance use disorders should be provided with physician- led, team- based care that is evidence- based and offers the ancillary and supportive services that are necessary to support rehabilitati on; and (5) through its communication vehicles, encourages all physicians to increase their knowledge regarding the effects of drug and alcohol use during pregnancy and breastfeeding and to routinely inquire about alcohol and drug use in the course of providing prenatal care.

AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 506 (A-23) Introduced by: Medical Student Section Subject: Encouraging Collaboration Between Physicians and Industry in AI (Augmented Intelligence) Development Referred to: Reference Committee E Whereas, Our American Medical Association supports augmented intelligence (AI) systems 1 that advance the quadruple aim, specifically AMA H -480.939, \"Augmented Intelligence in 2 Health Care:\" 3 (1) To enhance the patient experience of care and outcomes, 4 (2) To improve population health, 5 (3) To reduce overall costs for the healthcare system while increasing value, 6 (4) To support the professional satisfaction of physicians and the healthcare team; and 7 8 Whereas, Our AMA seeks to identify opportunities to integrate practicing physicians' 9 perspectives into the development, design, validation, and implementation of health care AI 10 AMA policy H-480.940, \"Augmented Intelligence in Health Care\"; and 11 12 Whereas, Research from the medical device industry has provided evidence that physicians 13 substantially contribute to medical device innovation, specifically that: 14 (1) Physicians contributed to a fifth of medical device patents and generated a great 15 number of citations, demonstrating a substantial physician involvement in medical 16 device innovation1, 17 (2) Physician patents were cited more times by subsequent patents than those without 18 physician involvement, where the number of citation by follow -on inventions indicate 19 the significance of the original innovation1, 20 (3) Physician patents generated more follow- on innovations from a more diverse set of 21 disciplines, emphasizing the broader impact of physician involvement in research1; 22 and 23 24 Whereas, Research on the implementation of electronic health records (EHRs) has indicated 25 that technology developed with physician involvement is associated with physicians' 26 perceived ease of use and acceptance2; and 27 28 Whereas, Current research on AI has indicated that: 29 (1) Physicians assisted by AI models can outperform physicians or AI alone, specifically 30 in diagnosing metastatic breast cancer and diabetic retinopathy3, 4, 31 (2) Physicians can use interactive AI -based technologies in medical image segmentation 32 and identification, providing evidence that physicians and AI technologies can work 33 together to better fulfill the quadruple aim5; and 34 35 Whereas, Our AMA has launched pathways for healthcare innovation, but these pathways 36 are greatly targeted to physicians currently involved in AI, such as Health 2047, a business 37 that connects our AMA to leading experts in AI and machine learning to produce healthcare 38 solutions6; and 39 Resolution: 506 (A-23) Page 2 of 4 Whereas, Our AMA has supported physician innovation, especially in the field of AI, through 1 the Physician Innovation Network (PIN), an online forum board for entrepreneurs to seek 2 medical specialists to \"connect the health care innovation ecosystems to improve the 3 development of emerging healthcare technology solutions\"7; and 4 5 Whereas, Early analysis of the PIN has identified that early engagement of physicians and 6 respecting a physician's time and expertise contribute to more meaningful connections 7 between physicians and entrepreneurs8; and 8 9 Whereas, The PIN currently experiences limited physician utilization, as evidenced by: 10 (1) Interviews with current physicians on the PIN suggest that the PIN only appeals to a 11 small subset of physicians who hav e already realized early in their careers that they 12 wish to pursue a nontraditional path in medicine and innovation9, 13 (2) As of 2018, only 2,600 physicians were reported to be on the network, or about 1% of 14 our AMA's physician membership base10; and 15 16 Whereas, Our AMA advocates that our organization, national, and medical specialty societies 17 and state medical associations (AMA, H -480.939): 18 (1) Leverage medical expertise to ensure clinical validation and assessment of clinical 19 applications of AI systems by practicing physicians, 20 (2) Outline a new professional role to aid and guide health care AI systems; therefore be 21 it 22 23 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association augment the existing Physician 24 Innovation Network (PIN) through the creation of advisors to specifically link physician 25 members of AMA and its associated specialty societies with companies or individuals 26 working on augmented intelligence (AI) research and development, focusing on: 27 (1) Expanding recruitment among AMA physician members, 28 (2) Advising AMA physician members who are interested in healthcare innovation/AI 29 without knowledge of proper channels to pursue their ideas, 30 (3) Increasing outreach from AMA to industry leaders and companies to both further 31 promote the PIN and to understand the needs of specific companies, 32 (4) Facilitating communication between companies and physicians with similar interests, 33 (5) Matching physicians to projects early in their design and testing stages, 34 (6) Decreasing the time and workload spent by indivi dual physicians on finding projects 35 themselves, 36 (7) Above all, boosting physician- centered innovation in the field of AI research and 37 development (Directive to Take Action); and be it further 38 39 RESOLVED, That our AMA support selection of PIN advisors through an application process 40 where candidates are screened by PIN leadership for interpersonal skills, problem solving, 41 networking abilities, objective decision making, and familiarity with industry.

RELEVANT AMA POLICY Augmented Intelligence in Health Care H -480.940 As a leader in American medicine, our AMA has a unique opportunity to ensure that the evolution of augmented intelligence (AI) in medicine benefits patients, physicians, and the health care community. To that end our AMA will seek to: 1. Leverage its ongoing engagement in digital health and other priority areas for improving patient outcomes and physiciansprofessional satisfaction to help set priorities for health care AI. 2. Identify opportunities to integrate the perspective of practicing physicians into the development, design, validation, and implementation of health care AI. 3. Promote development of thoughtfully designed, high- quality, clinically validated health care AI that: a. is designed and evaluated in keeping with best practices in user -centered design, particularly for physicians and other members of the health care team; b. is transparent; c. conforms to leading standards for reproducibility; d. identifies and takes steps to address bias and avoids introducing or exacerbating health care disparities including when testing or deploying new AI tools on vulnerable populations; and e. safeguards patientsand other individualsprivacy interests and preserves the security and integrity of personal information. 4. Encourage education for patients, physicians, medical students, other health care professionals, and health administrators to promote greater underst anding of the promise and limitations of health care AI. 5. Explore the legal implications of health care AI, such as issues of liability or intellectual property, and advocate for appropriate professional and governmental oversight for safe, effective, and equitable use of and access to health care AI. Citation: BOT Rep. 41, A -18; Resolution: 506 (A-23) Page 4 of 4 Augmented Intelligence in Health Care H -480.939 Our AMA supports the use and payment of augmented intelligence (AI) systems that advance the quadruple aim. AI systems should enhance the patient experience of care and outcomes, improve population health, reduce overall costs for the health care system while increasing value, and support the professional satisfaction of physicians and the health care team. To that end our AMA wil l advocate that: 1. Oversight and regulation of health care AI systems must be based on risk of harm and benefit accounting for a host of factors, including but not limited to: intended and reasonably expected use(s); evidence of safety, efficacy, and equi ty including addressing bias; AI system methods; level of automation; transparency; and, conditions of deployment. 2. Payment and coverage for all health care AI systems must be conditioned on complying with all appropriate federal and state laws and regul ations, including, but not limited to those governing patient safety, efficacy, equity, truthful claims, privacy, and security as well as state medical practice and licensure laws. 3. Payment and coverage for health care AI systems intended for clinical care must be conditioned on (a) clinical validation; (b) alignment with clinical decision -making that is familiar to physicians; and (c) high- quality clinical evidence. 4. Payment and coverage for health care AI systems must (a) be informed by real world wor kflow and human- centered design principles; (b) enable physicians to prepare for and transition to new care delivery models; (c) support effective communication and engagement between patients, physicians, and the health care team; (d) seamlessly integrate clinical, administrative, and population health management functions into workflow; and (e) seek end- user feedback to support iterative product improvement. 5. Payment and coverage policies must advance affordability and access to AI systems that are desi gned for small physician practices and patients and not limited to large practices and institutions. Government - conferred exclusivities and intellectual property laws are meant to foster innovation, but constitute interventions into the free market, and therefore, should be appropriately balanced with the need for competition, access, and affordability. 6. Physicians should not be penalized if they do not use AI systems while regulatory oversight, standards, clinical validation, clinical usefulness, and sta ndards of care are in flux. Furthermore, our AMA opposes: a. Policies by payers, hospitals, health systems, or governmental entities that mandate use of health care AI systems as a condition of licensure, participation, payment, or coverage. b. The imposit ion of costs associated with acquisition, implementation, and maintenance of healthcare AI systems on physicians without sufficient payment. 7. Liability and incentives should be aligned so that the individual(s) or entity(ies) best positioned to know the AI system risks and best positioned to avert or mitigate harm do so through design, development, validation, and implementation. Our AMA will further advocate: a. Where a mandated use of AI systems prevents mitigation of risk and harm, the individual or entity issuing the mandate must be assigned all applicable liability. b. Developers of autonomous AI systems with clinical applications (screening, diagnosis, treatment) are in the best position to manage issues of liability arising directly from system fail ure or misdiagnosis and must accept this liability with measures such as maintaining appropriate medical liability insurance and in their agreements with users. c. Health care AI systems that are subject to non- disclosure agreements concerning flaws, malfunctions, or patient harm (referred to as gag clauses) must not be covered or paid and the party initiating or enforcing the gag clause assumes liability for any harm. 8. Our AMA, national medical specialty societies, and state medical associations \u2014 a. Identify areas of medical practice where AI systems would advance the quadruple aim; b. Leverage existing expertise to ensure clinical validation and clinical assessment of clinical applications of AI systems by medical experts; c. Outline new professional rol es and capacities required to aid and guide health care AI systems; and d. Develop practice guidelines for clinical applications of AI systems. 9. There should be federal and state interagency collaboration with participation of the physician community and other stakeholders in order to advance the broader infrastructural capabilities and requirements necessary for AI solutions in health care to be sufficiently inclusive to benefit all patients, physicians, and other health care stakeholders.

Citation: BOT Rep. 21, A -19; Reaffirmation: A -22; AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 507 (A-23) Introduced by: Medical Student Section Subject: Recognizing the Burden of Rare Disease Referred to: Reference Committee E Whereas, Rare diseases, also known as orphan diseases, are defined as conditions that affect 1 less than 200,000 individuals in the United States (US), categorized into various overlapping 2 disease classes including but not limited to chromosomal disorders, connective tissue diseases, 3 blood diseases, metabolic disorders, skin diseases, and autoimmune conditions1-3; and 4 5 Whereas, Rare diseases cumulatively affect a significant number of people in the US, estimated 6 to be between 25- 30 million individuals4; and 7 8 Whereas, Congress passed The Orphan Drug Act (ODA) to incentivize drug companies to 9 develop treatments for rare diseases and rapidly deploy novel agents to target conditi ons 10 affecting fewer than 200,000 persons in the United States, or conditions for which a drug will not 11 be profitable within 7 years following approval by the FDA5-7; and 12 13 Whereas, Current orphan drug legislation to support biopharmaceutical R&D portfolio diversity, 14 enhance patent exclusivity, and provide distinct FDA designations is not sufficient to promote 15 novel drug development for different rare disease classes as 90% of these patients are without 16 an FDA approved treatment8-10; and 17 18 Whereas, The Affordable Care Act does not specifically address orphan drugs coverage, and 19 even when new treatment options such as drug prescriptions or medical devices are available 20 for people with rare diseases, 61% of patients are denied or delayed in accessing treatment due 21 to insurance company pre- approval8,11; and 22 23 Whereas, There are many disparities in rare disease health care including 39% of respondents 24 traveling 60 or more miles for medical care, 17% considering or completing relocation, and 29% 25 being granted access to treatment not approved by FDA1,8; and 26 27 Whereas, The mean health related quality of life scores of those with orphan diseases were the 28 poorest compared to individuals with common chronic diseases, which may be attributed to 29 diagnostic challenges, decreased access to medical information and treatment, and negative 30 psychological impact such as coping with uncertainty12; and 31 32 Whereas, In 2019, health care costs associated with orphan diseases may be comparable to 33 heart disease or cancer at $966 billion, accounting for direct, indirect, and non- medical costs 34 associated with diagnosis and amounting to nearly 50% of the total national bill, despite a vastly 35 lower percentage of rare disease within the population10,13,14; and 36 37 Whereas, The number of documented cases of many rare diseases are only expected to 38 increase given recent advances in genomics and personalized medicine15; and 39 Resolution: 507 (A-23) Page 2 of 5 Whereas, There is a lack of reliable epidemiological data for patients with orphan diseases and 1 insufficient knowledge o n the pathophysiology of these conditions among health care providers, 2 leading to inadequate access to information on disease prevalence and treatment outcomes16; 3 and 4 5 Whereas, A lack of knowledge has made treatment options difficult for patients with orphan 6 diseases to access, contributing to difficulty and delay in diagnosis, as shown by a National 7 Organization for Rare Diseases (NORD) 2019 report that found 28% of individuals diagnosed 8 with a rare disease did not receive a diagnosis for seven years or more and 38% of individuals 9 received a misdiagnosis8,17,18; and 10 11 Whereas, Due to barriers in accessing treatment options, patients with rare diseases have 12 difficulty finding treatment information and patient registries, such as Rare Disease Registries 13 have become a tool for both patients and physicians to be educated on their condition19; and 14 15 Whereas, Natural history studies and patient registries collecting longitudinal, patient- driven 16 data aided by machine learning help advance our understanding of rare diseases and how they 17 progress over time, facilitating clinical research and the development of novel therapeutics8,20; 18 and 19 20 Whereas, Recent automated tracking systems, such as RENEW, are being used to gather new 21 global genomic discoveries onto an accessible database for genome sequencing of patients for 22 improved therapeutic outcomes21; and 23 24 Whereas, Incorporation of genomic research as clinical diagnostic tests can increase lar ge 25 scale sequencing projects of structural variants and sharing of data that shortens the time to 26 diagnosis by producing increased cohort sizes for development of personalized therapeutic 27 options22; and 28 29 Whereas, With future advances in techniques such as genome -wide pooled CRISPR screening 30 and plasmid- based reporter assays, which can shorten time to diagnosis, precision therapeutics 31 could be used as a targeted and efficient approach in orphan disease treatment23,24; and 32 33 Whereas, With only 30% of the genome accounted for in the diagnosis of rare disease there is 34 still 75% of phenotypic variations within the genome unaccounted for, in which future novel gene 35 discovery through sequencing efforts can overcome this diagnostic challenge24; and 36 37 Whereas, AMA pol icy H -185.963 emphasizes insurance coverage for childhood and congenital 38 diseases, but does not sufficiently include the orphan disease population or specialized genomic 39 research considerations needed for timely diagnosis and treatment; therefore be it 40 41 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association recognize the under -treatment and under - 42 diagnosis of orphan diseases, the burden of costs to health care systems and affected 43 individuals, and the health disparities among patients with orphan diseases (New HOD Policy) ; 44 and be it further 45 46 RESOLVED, That our AMA support efforts to increase awareness of patient registries, to 47 improve diagnostic and genetic tests, and to incentivize drug companies to develop novel 48 therapeutics to better understand and treat orphan diseases.

(2) Health insurance providers should be prohibited from establishing differential rates or premium payments based on genetic information or an individual's request for genetic services. (3) Health insurance providers should be prohibited from requesting or requiring collection or disclosure of genetic information. (4) Health insurance providers and other holders of genetic information should be prohibited from releasing genetic information without express prior written authorization of th e individual. Written authorization should be required for each disclosure and include to whom the disclosure would be made.

The AMA declares: (a) that treatment of a minor child's congenital or developmental deformity or disorder due to trauma or malignant disease should be covered by all insurers; (b) that such coverage shall include treatment which, in the opinion of the treating physician, is medically necessary to return the patient to a more normal appearance (even if the procedure does not materially affect the function of the body part being treated); and (c) that such insurability should be portable, i.e., not denied as a pre-existing condition if the patient's insurance coverage changes before treatment has been either initiated or completed. 2.

Our AMA supports the following continuity of care principles for any financial incentive program (FIP): a. Collaborate with the physician community in the development and implementation of patient incentives. b. Collaborate wit h the physician community to identify high- value referral options based on both quality and cost of care. c. Provide treating physicians with access to patients' FIP benefits information in real -time during patient consultations, allowing patients and phys icians to work together to select appropriate referral options. d. Inform referring and/or primary care physicians when their patients have selected an FIP service prior to the provision of that service. e. Provide referring and/or primary care physicians with the full record of the service encounter. f. Never interfere with a patient -physician relationship (eg, by proactively suggesting health care items or services that may or may not become part of a future care plan). g. Inform patients that only treati ng physicians can determine whether a lower -cost care option is medically appropriate in their case and encourage patients to consult with their physicians prior to making changes to established care plans. 2. Our AMA supports the following quality and cos t principles for any FIP: a. Remind patients that they can receive care from the physician or facility of their choice consistent with their health plan benefits. b. Provide publicly available information regarding the metrics used to identify, and quality scores Resolution: 507 (A-23) Page 5 of 5 associated with, lower and higher -cost health care items, services, physicians and facilities. c. Provide patients and physicians with the quality scores associated with both lower and higher -cost physicians and facilities, as well as information r egarding the methods used to determine quality scores. Differences in cost due to specialty or sub- specialty focus should be explicitly stated and clearly explained if data is made public. d. Respond within a reasonable timeframe to inquiries of whether the physician is among the preferred lower -cost physicians; the physician's quality scores and those of lower -cost physicians; and directions for how to appeal exclusion from lists of preferred lower -cost physicians. e. Provide a process through which patients and physicians can report unsatisfactory care experiences when referred to lower -cost physicians or facilities. The reporting process should be easily accessible by patients and physicians participating in the program. f. Provide meaningful transparency of prices and vendors. g. Inform patients of the health plan cost -sharing and any financial incentives associated with receiving care from FIP -preferred, other in- network, and out -of-network physicians and facilities. h. Inform patients that pursuing lower -cost and/or incentivized care, including FIP incentives, may require them to undertake some burden, such as traveling to a lower -cost site of service or complying with a more complex dosing regimen for lower -cost prescription drugs. i. Methods of cost at tribution to a physician or facility must be transparent, and the assumptions underlying cost attributions must be publicly available if cost is a factor used to stratify physicians or facilities. 3. Our AMA supports requiring health insurers to indemnify patients for any additional medical expenses resulting from needed services following inadequate FIP -recommended services. 4. Our AMA opposes FIPs that effectively limit patient choice by making alternatives other than the FIP - preferred choice so expensive, onerous and inconvenient that patients effectively must choose the FIP choice. 5. Our AMA encourages state medical associations and national medical specialty societies to apply these principles in seeking opportunities to collaborate in the design and i mplementation of FIPs, with the goal of empowering physicians and patients to make high- value referral choices. 6. Our AMA encourages objective studies of the impact of FIPs that include data collection on dimensions such as: a. Patient outcomes/the qualit y of care provided with shopped services; b. Patient utilization of shopped services; c. Patient satisfaction with care for shopped services; d. Patient choice of health care provider; e. Impact on physician administrative burden; and f. Overall/systemic i mpact on health care costs and care fragmentation. Citation: CMS Rep. 2, I -19; AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 508 (A-23) Introduced by: Medical Student Section Subject: Development and Implementation of Recommendations for Responsible Media Coverage of Opioid Overdoses Referred to: Reference Committee E Whereas, The number of opioid- related overdose deaths in the United States has been 1 steadily increasing since 1999, reaching 80,816 deaths in 20211-3; and 2 3 Whereas, The media has the capacity to condition people's perceptions of and attitudes 4 towards disease severity4; and 5 6 Whereas, By selectively including or excluding content, perspecti ves, and material, media 7 platforms have a powerful capacity to frame issues, shape community attitudes, and impact 8 political decision making5; and 9 10 Whereas, Media coverage of the opioid overdose crisis has impacted public attitudes 11 regarding the crisis and the subsequent response5-7; and 12 13 Whereas, The Herald Sun newspaper in Australia effectively put heroin at the forefront of the 14 public agenda by consistently highlighting heroin-related overdose deaths in the 1990s5; and 15 16 Whereas, In the United States from 2008- 2013, the news media used an increasing amount 17 of stigmatizing language, such as referring to victims of addiction as \"substance abusers\" or 18 \"addicts\" (appeared in 49% of stories) in lieu of less stigmatizing substitutes such as \"person 19 with a substance use disorder\" (appeared in 2% of stories), potentially leading to increased 20 stigma regarding opioid addiction among the American public6; and 21 22 Whereas, In the United States from 1998- 2012, coverage of the opioid epidemic focused on 23 criminal justice solutions for the opioid epidemic; this coverage shifted to increasingly 24 emphasize treatment, harm reduction, and prevention from 2013- 2017, largely mirroring 25 increased public acceptance that the War on Drugs had failed7; and 26 27 Whereas, Despite increased coverage of the opioid epidemic in the United States occurring 28 through the framework of prevention and treatment from 2013 -2017, many evidence- based 29 solutions were rarely mentioned, including the use of medication for treatment (9% of 30 stories), syringe service programs (5% of stories), and safe injection sites (2% of stories)7; 31 and 32 33 Whereas, The lack of mention of these evidence -based interventions in the news media is 34 correlated with reduced public acceptance of these approaches for treatment of the opioid 35 epidemic7-9; and 36 Resolution: 508 (A-23) Page 2 of 3 Whereas, The stigma surrounding opioid addiction and strategies for harm reduction have 1 significantly hindered the public health response to the opioid epidemic in the United States10; 2 and 3 4 Whereas, Increased stigma associated with media coverage of the opioid epidemic adversely 5 impacts the ability of patients to seek and receive treatment for opioid addiction, as 25% of 6 individuals report negative impacts on their job or fear of a negative opinion of community 7 members as reasons for not s eeking treatment11; and 8 9 Whereas, News media framing of the opioid epidemic in the context of race has contributed 10 to the differentiation of \"white from black (and brown) suffering, white from black culpability, 11 and white from black deservingness\" in the public discourse12; and 12 13 Whereas, Coded language used by the media can also contribute to the framing of issues, 14 for example by establishing \"urban\" as code for Black or Latino and \"suburban\"/\"rural\" as 15 code for White, effectively creating perceived separat e spaces for white and Black drug 16 users12; and 17 18 Whereas, This difference in framing leads to a system where Black and Brown people who 19 use drugs are more likely to be incarcerated and less likely to be offered access to healthcare 20 providers, addiction treatment, and tools to prevent overdose and infection12; and 21 22 Whereas, News media framing of White victims of the opioid epidemic as innocent and their 23 deaths as shocking or out of the ordinary contrasts with persistent framing of the opioid 24 epidemic in Black or Brown communities as normal, contributing to increased stigma13; and 25 26 Whereas, Stigmatization and marginalization of victims of opioid addiction are associated 27 with greater support for punitive policies instead of investment in prevention and treatment 28 programs14; and 29 30 Whereas, Ecological studies have shown a significant tendency for increases in fatal 31 overdoses to follow increased media coverage of opioid- related deaths15; and 32 33 Whereas, Our American Medical Association supports the development of standards for 34 media coverage of mass shootings to help address the gun violence public health crisis in 35 Policy H- 145.971, showing that the precedent exists for the AMA to encourage more 36 thoughtful public engagement with health -related issues; ther efore be it 37 38 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association encourage the Centers for Disease 39 Control and Prevention, in collaboration with other public and private organizations, to 40 develop recommendations or best practices for media coverage and portrayal of opioid drug 41 overdoses.

Citation : Res. 212, I -18; Modified: Res. 934, I -19; AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 509 (A-23) Introduced by: Medical Student Section Subject: Addressing Medical Misinformation Online Referred to: Reference Committee E Whereas, Medical misinformation is information contrary to the consensus of the scientific 1 community that may or may not be intended to mislead, while medical disinformation is 2 misinformation that is deliberately spread with intent to mislead1-3; and 3 4 Whereas, Medical misinformation is spread by many different sources online, such as online 5 forums, advertisements, user comments on news and retail sites, social media, search 6 engines, digital magazines, and products sold by online retailers1,3,4,5; and 7 8 Whereas, Medical misinformation has a large impact on a wide variety of healthcare topics 9 including smoking, statin use, use of unproven treatments, harassment of health workers, 10 and vaccine hesitancy5,6; and 11 12 Whereas, It was found that misinformation propagated significantly farther and faster online 13 than did accurate information5,7,8; and 14 15 Whereas, Misinformation about the Zika virus was three times more likely to be shared than 16 were verified stories as seen on multiple social media sites, with half of the top -10 news 17 stories regarding Zika thought to be misinformation7,8; and 18 19 Whereas, More than half of the United States population used the internet as their primary 20 source for health information in 2018, indicating a reliance on websites for health 21 information9; and 22 23 Whereas, Research has shown that exposure to just five online misinformation posts about 24 the COVID -19 vaccine were sufficient to make respondents less likely to want a COVID -19 25 vaccine5,10; and 26 27 Whereas, Search engine algorithms provide results based on the user's search history and 28 usage of suggested sites or videos, meaning that if one clicks on a site or video promoting 29 medical misinformation, they will have more misinformation sites or videos promoted to them 30 over accurate information5,11; and 31 32 Whereas, The likelihood that a person will view a particular website and then trust in that 33 website are influenced by its order of appearanc e on major search engines12,13; and 34 35 Whereas, Search engines often fail to ensure that the search results provided are credible or 36 trustworthy13;

Citation: Res. 421, A -21; Reaffirmed: BOT Rep. 15, A- 22; AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 510 (A-23) Introduced by: Medical Student Section Subject: Comparative Effectiveness Research Referred to: Reference Committee E Whereas, Pharmaceutical companies submit investigational new drug (IND) applications to seek 1 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for new medications and supplemental new drug 2 (NDA) applications to seek FDA approval for additional clinical indications for a previously 3 approved medication1,2; and 4 5 Whereas, Widespread off -label use of many medications by physicians indicates that 6 pharmaceutical companies do not submit NDAs at a rate that keeps pace with emerging clinical 7 practice2; and 8 9 Whereas, A study of 197 new drugs that were approved by the FDA and became available as 10 generics between 1997 and 2020 demonstrated that new FDA indications for additional clinical 11 conditions were added for 64 drugs (32%), which occurred almost exclusively while they were 12 still patented even when off -label uses for those drugs emerged afterward, suggesting that 13 generic availability disincentivizes pharmaceutical company trials to seek new indications3; and 14 15 Whereas, While off -label use of drugs by physicians is common and often beneficial for patient 16 access to treatment, the lack of adequate clinical trials, such as those conducted by 17 pharmaceutical companies, to seek new FDA indications when off -label uses emerge limits the 18 evidence basis for their use and importantly, reimbursement by insurance plans4; and 19 20 Whereas, Pharmaceutical companies patent, run clinical trials for, and profit from INDs that are 21 structurally, functionally, and therapeutically similar to existing generic medications or natural 22 products that are widely available in other formulations5,6; and 23 24 Whereas, As a natural product, melatonin is not patentable and can be purchased over the 25 counter as a dietary supplement for 10 cents a tablet7; and 26 27 Whereas, Ramelteon (brand name Rozerem) is a melatonin derivative which aims to improve 28 sleep by stimulating the melatonin receptor, thus employing the same mechanism of action as 29 the naturally occurring substance melatonin8,9; and 30 31 Whereas, As a non -natural product, Ramelteon was able to be patented, leading to a cost of 32 approximately 10 dollars per pill, which is 100x the cost of a melatonin dietary supplement pill, 33 despite lack of testing to show a difference in efficacy between R amelteon and melatonin9; and 34 35 Whereas, As another example, ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist approved by the FDA 36 in 1970 as an anesthetic, demonstrated efficacy as an off- label antidepressant in the early 37 2000s10,11; and 38 Resolution: 510 (A-23) Page 2 of 6 Whereas, Despite ketamine's efficacy as an off -label antidepressant and its wide availability and 1 low cost in generic oral and IV formulations, no pharmaceutical company has attempted to add 2 depression as an FDA indication for oral or IV ketamine, even though FDA indications are often 3 tied to insurance reimbursement12; and 4 5 Whereas, Experts attribute the lack of a ketamine FDA approval for depression to its 2002 6 patent expiration, which then allowed the production of generic ketamine, reducing potential 7 profit, and removing the incentive for pharmaceutical companies to conduct expensive clinical 8 trials to add depression as an indication for oral or IV ketamine12; and 9 10 Whereas, While adding depression as an indication for oral or IV ketamine is not necessary, as 11 these available generic formulations can still be prescribed for depression off -label, Johnson & 12 Johnson proceeded to conduct clinical trials for an IND application for a similar compound that 13 could be patented and sold for higher profits, which resulted in the 2019 FDA approval of 14 esketamine (brand name Spravato) nasal spray13; and 15 16 Whereas, A cost -effectiveness study of esketamine concluded that its price would need to 17 decrease by nearly half in order to be cost -effective for treatment- resistant depression in the 18 US14; and 19 20 Whereas, Many of the esketamine clinical trials analyzed for its FDA approval only compared it 21 to placebo and not to existing formulations of the structurally similar oral or IV ketamine, and 22 several studies suggest that differences in antidepressant efficacy between esketamine and 23 ketamine may be negligible or that ketamine may even be superior to esketamine15; and 24 25 Whereas, Ketamine remains inadequately studied and does not have an FDA indication as an 26 antidepressant, despite its wide availability as a generic, relatively low cost (especially 27 compared to the patented esketamine), and potential clinical benefit to millions of Americans 28 suffering from treatment -resistant depression12,16,17; and 29 30 Whereas, The AMA \"supports programs whose purpose is to contain the rising costs of 31 prescription drugs\" (H- 110.997); and 32 33 Whereas, The AMA supports \"autonomous clinical decision- making authority of a physician and 34 that a physician may lawfully use an FDA approved drug product or medical device for an off - 35 label indication when such use is based upon sound scientific evidence\" (H -120.988); and 36 37 Whereas, Proper comparisons in clinical trials can give physicians the scientific evidence 38 needed to provide the best care for their patients, while simultaneously containing the cost of 39 prescription drugs by avoiding prescribing drugs that have significantly greater cost but show no 40 additional clinical benefit ; therefore be it 41 42 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association study the feasibility of including 43 comparative effectiveness studies in various FDA drug regulatory processes, including 44 comparisons with existing standard of care, available generics and biosimilars, and drugs 45 commonly used off -label and over -the-counter (Directive to Take Action); and be it further 46 47 RESOLVED, That our AMA ask the National Institutes of Health to support and fund 48 comparative effectiveness research for approved drugs, including comparisons with existing 49 standar d of care, available generics and biosimilars, and drugs commonly used off -label and 50 over-the-counter.

RELEVANT AMA POLICY E7.2.3 Patents & Dissemination of Research Products A patent grants the holder the right, for a limited time, to prevent others from commercializing his or her inventions. By requiring full disclosure of the invention, and thus enabling another trained in the art to replicate it, the patent system protects the holder's discovery, yet also fosters information sharing. Patenting is also thought to encourage private investment into research. With respect to genetic research, patenting raises unique questions. Arguments have been made that the patenting of human genetic material sets a troubling precedent for the ownership or commodification of human life. However, DNA sequences are not tantamount to human life and it is unclear where and whether qualities uniquely human are found in genetic material. Moreover, while genetic research holds great potential for developing new medical therapies it remains unclear what role patenting wil l play in ensuring such development. Physicians who develop medical innovations may ethically patent their discoveries or products but should uphold the following guidelines: (a) Not use patents (or other means, such as trade secrets or confidentiality agreements) to limit the availability of medical innovations. Patent protection should not hinder the goal of achieving better medical treatments and technologies. Resolution: 510 (A-23) Page 4 of 6 (b) Not allow patents to languish. Physicians who hold patents should negotiate and structure l icensing agreements in such a way as to encourage the development of better medical technology. (c) For patents on genetic materials recognize that: (i) patents on processes, e.g. to isolate and purify gene sequences, are ethically preferable to patents on the substances themselves; (ii) patents on purified proteins (substance patents) are ethically preferable to patents on genes or DNA sequences. Descriptions for (substance) patents on proteins, genes, or genetic sequences should be carefully constructed to ensure that the patent holder does not limit the use of a naturally occurring form of the substance in question. Issued: 2016 Pharmaceutical Costs H -110.987 1. Our AMA encourages Federal Trade Commission (FTC) actions to limit anticompetitive behavior by pharmaceutical companies attempting to reduce competition from generic manufacturers through manipulation of patent protections and abuse of regulatory exclusivity incentives. 2. Our AMA encourages Congress, the FTC and the Department of Health and Human Services to monitor and evaluate the utilization and impact of controlled distribution channels for prescription pharmaceuticals on patient access and market competition. 3. Our AMA will monitor the impact of mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry. 4. Our AMA will continue to monitor and support an appropriate balance between incentives based on appropriate safeguards for innovation on the one hand and efforts to reduce regulatory and statutory barriers to competition as part of the patent system. 5. Our AMA encourages prescription drug price and cost transparency among pharmaceutical companies, pharmacy benefit managers and health insurance companies. 6. Our AMA supports legislation to require generic drug manufacturers to pay an additional rebate to state Medicaid programs if the price of a generic drug rises faster than inflation. 7. Our AMA supports legislation to shorten the exclusivity period for biologics. 8. Our AMA will convene a task force of appropriate AMA Councils, state medical societies and national medical specialty societies to develop principles to guide advocacy and grassroots efforts aimed at addressing pharmaceutical costs and improving patient access and adherence to medically necessary prescription drug regimens. 9. Our AMA will generate an advocacy campaign to engage physicians and patients in local and national advocacy initiatives that bring attention to the rising price of prescription drugs and help to put forward solutions to make prescription drugs more affordable for all patients. 10. Our AMA supports: (a) drug price transparency legislation that requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide public notice before increasing the price of any drug (generic, brand, or specialty) by 10% or more each year or per course of treatment and provide justification for the price increase; (b) legislation that authorizes the Attorney General and/or the Federal Trade Commission to take legal action to address price gouging by pharmaceutical manufacturers and increase access to affordable drugs for patients; and (c) the expedited review of generic drug applications and prioritizing review of such applications when there is a drug shortage, no available comparable generic drug, or a price increase of 10% or more each year or per course of treatment. 11. Our AMA advocates for policies that prohibit price gouging on prescription medications when there are no justifiable factors or data to support the price increase. 12. Our AMA will provide assistance upon request to state medical associations in support of state legislative and regulatory efforts addressing drug price and cost transparency. 13. Our AMA supports legislation to shorten the exclusivity period for FDA pharmaceutical products where manufacturers engage in anti- competitive behaviors or unwarranted price escalations. 14. Our AMA supports legislation that limits Medicare annual drug price increases to the rate of inflation.

Our AMA reaffirms its support for the principles that: (a) an FDA decision to approve a new drug, to withdraw a drug's approval, or to change the indications for use of a drug must be based on sound scientific and medical evidence derived from controlled trials, real -world data (RWD) fit for regulatory purpose, and/or postmarket incident reports as provided by statute; (b) this evidence should be evaluated by the FDA, in consultation with its Advisory Committees and expert extramural advisory bodies; and (c) any risk/benefit analysis or relative safety or efficacy judgments should not be grounds for limiting access to or indications for use of a drug unless the weight of the evidence from clinical trials, RWD fit for regulatory purpose, and postmarket reports shows that the drug is unsafe and/or ineffective for its labeled indications. 2. The AMA believes that social and economic concerns and disputes per se should not be permitted to play a significant part in the FDA's decision- making process in the course of FDA devising either general or product specific drug regulation. 3. It is the position of our AMA that the Food and Drug Administration should not permit political considerations or conflicts of interest to overrule scientific evidence in making pol icy decisions; and our AMA urges the current administration and all future administrations to consider our best and brightest scientists for positions on advisory committees and councils regardless of their political affiliation and voting history.

Our AMA confirms its strong support for the autonomous clinical decision- making authority of a physician and that a physician may lawfully use an FDA ap proved drug product or medical device for an off-label indication when such use is based upon sound scientific evidence or sound medical opinion; and affirms the position that, when the prescription of a drug or use of a device represents safe and effectiv e therapy, third party payers, including Medicare, should consider the intervention as clinically appropriate medical care, irrespective of labeling, should fulfill their obligation to their beneficiaries by covering such therapy, and be required to cover appropriate 'off -label' uses of drugs on their formulary. 2. Our AMA strongly supports the important need for physicians to have access to accurate and unbiased information about off -label uses of drugs and devices, while ensuring that manufacturer -sponsor ed promotions remain under FDA regulation. 3. Our AMA supports the dissemination of generally available information about off -label uses by manufacturers to physicians. Such information should be independently derived, peer reviewed, scientifically sound, and truthful and not misleading. The information should be provided in its entirety, not be edited or altered by the manufacturer, and be clearly distinguished and not appended to manufacturer - sponsored materials. Such information may comprise journal arti cles, books, book chapters, or clinical practice guidelines. Books or book chapters should not focus on any particular drug. Dissemination of information by manufacturers to physicians about off -label uses should be accompanied by the approved product labeling and disclosures regarding the lack of FDA approval for such uses, and disclosure of the source of any financial support or author financial conflicts. 4. Physicians have the responsibility to interpret and put into context information received from any source, including pharmaceutical manufacturers, before making clinical decisions (e.g., prescribing a drug for an off -label use). 5. Our AMA strongly supports the addition to FDA -approved labeling those uses of drugs for which safety and efficacy have be en demonstrated. 6. Our AMA supports the continued authorization, implementation, and coordination of the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act and the Pediatric Research Equity Act.

(2) It should be recognized that generic drugs frequently can be less costly alternatives to brand- name products. (3) Substituti on with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \"B\" -rated generic drug products (i.e., products with potential or known bioequivalence problems) should be prohibited by law, except when there is prior authorization from the prescribing physician. (4) Physicians should report serious adverse events that may be related to generic substitution, including the name, dosage form, and the manufacturer, to the FDA's MedWatch program. (5) The FDA, in conjunction with our AMA and the United States Pharmacopoeia, should ex plore ways to more effectively inform physicians about the bioequivalence of generic drugs, including decisional criteria used to determine the bioequivalence of individual products. (6) The FDA should fund or conduct additional research in order to identi fy the optimum methodology to determine bioequivalence, including the concept of individual bioequivalence, between pharmaceutically equivalent drug products (i.e., products that contain the same active ingredient(s), are of the same dosage form, route of administration, and are identical in strength). (7) The Congress should provide adequate resources to the FDA to continue to support an effective generic drug approval process.

AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 515 (A-23) Introduced by: Mississippi Subject: Regulate Kratom and Ban Over -The-Counter Sales Referred to: Reference Committee E Whereas, Kratom is a herbal supplement derived from a tropical tree, Mitragyna speciosa, that 1 has been used for centuries in Southeast Asia to all eviate pain, fatigue, and enhance mood; and 2 3 Whereas, Kratom has been marketed in the US as an over -the-counter supplement for similar 4 uses, but there is limited scientific evidence to support its safety and efficacy, and concerns 5 have been raised about it s potential for addiction, abuse, and adverse effects, including 6 seizures, liver damage, and death; and 7 8 Whereas, Kratom is not currently regulated by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) and has 9 not undergone clinical trials to determine its safety and effectiveness; and 10 11 Whereas, The American Medical Association recognizes the potential for kratom to be used as 12 an alternative treatment for opioid addiction, but also acknowledges the need for further 13 research to determine its safety and effectiveness; and 14 15 Whereas, The AMA believes that the regulation of kratom is necessary to ensure the safety and 16 well-being of patients and the general public; therefore be it 17 18 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association recommend the following: 19 20 1. Kratom should be regulated by the FDA, and its safety and efficacy should be 21 determined through clinical trials before it can be marketed or prescribed as a treatment 22 for any condition. 23 2. Over -the-counter sales o f kratom should be banned, and kratom should be available 24 only by prescription from a licensed healthcare provider if it is deemed to have a 25 medicinal use after proper research. 26 3. Individuals who are currently using kratom for pain management or other condit ions 27 should have access to appropriate medical care to manage their conditions and 28 withdrawal symptoms, if needed. 29 4. Criminalization of kratom use should not be the intent of this resolution, and individuals 30 who are using kratom for legitimate medical reasons should not be subject to criminal 31 penalties although if it is banned, this does not exclude criminalization of drug trafficking. 32 5. The Drug Enforcement Administration should conduct a comprehensive review of the 33 potential for kratom abuse and dependence and consider appropriate scheduling under 34 the Controlled Substances Act. A schedule 3 would make it unavailable over the counter 35 but avoid criminal penalties. 36 6. Research funding should be made available to study the potential therapeutic uses and 37 risks of kratom, and to develop evidence- based guidelines for its safe use. 38 Resolution: 515 (A-23) Page 2 of 2 7. Education and public awareness campaigns should be launched to inform healthcare 1 providers, patients, and the general public about the potential risks and benefits of 2 kratom and the need for caution in its use.

And finally, we expanded the AMA's social impact strategy while helping to improve the lives of residents in our home city with a $3 million multi-year investment in West Side United. Following 11 consecutive years of membership growth, in 2022 the AMA experienced a small decrease in overall membership (mainly due to a drop in student numbers), but physician membership remained steady. Overall, the organization's advocacy efforts and mission activities were supported by another strong year of financial performance. With unparalleled advocacy and engagement, strengthened by our industry-leading research, education and tools, the AMA continues to redefine what it means to be the physicians' powerful ally in patient care. Through challenges and change, in times of crisis and calm, the AMA is committed to physicians, patients and advancing medical practice\u2014and we will never back down. Sandra Adamson Fryhofer, MD Chair, Board of Trustees Michael Suk, MD, JD, MPH, MBA Finance Committee Chair, Board of Trustees James L. Madara, MD CEO and Executive Vice President It's been more than three years since the pandemic took hold of our nation and placed unrelenting pressure upon America's physicians and patients. While the number of deaths slowed and the cases trended downward through much of 2022, the pandemic underscored the urgent need to better support physicians who take care of this nation\u2014and fix what's broken in health care. And the AMA answered. The AMA met the challenge by introducing its Recovery Plan for America's Physicians. The strategy laid out specific actions needed to strengthen our nation's physician workforce, improve access to necessary care and rebuild our health system to more effectively respond to the next health crisis\u2014whatever it may be. In its first year the Recovery Plan delivered promising results, as AMA advocacy helped secure significant wins that locked in important telehealth expansions and protected physicians by limiting Medicare payment cuts. But this progress is not nearly enough. Much more is needed in 2023 and beyond to help physicians and their practices recover from the trauma of the pandemic and to help eliminate the pain points that continue to threaten patient care and drive physician dissatisfaction and burnout. In a year that marked the organization's 175th anniversary, the AMA in 2022 continued to fight relentlessly\u2014through the courts, in the halls of Congress and in state legislatures across the country\u2014on behalf of physicians and patients. We are proud that ours was among the nation's leading nonpartisan voices for science and vaccine efficacy, for advancing health equity, and in cutting through the fog of medical disinformation and misinformation. And we are equally proud that our voice once again set new standards for physician engagement across multimedia platforms, from content offered on our ever-expanding AMA Ed Hub digital education platform to record numbers of media impressions and unique visitors to our flagship website, growth that surpassed the record-high numbers from the pandemic's first year. Other aspects fundamental to the AMA's mission flourished as well. The AMA released a special edition of its Code of Medical Ethics , and the Journal of the American Medical Association , under the direction of new Editor-in-Chief Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, MD, PhD, MAS, maintained its place among the world's preeminent medical journals. All 12 specialty publications from the JAMA Network ranked among the top 10 in Journal Impact, with eight ranking in the top three for their respective Letter to stakeholders (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Revenues $ 493.4 $ 459.7 Cost of products sold and selling expense 30.6 25.9 General and administrative expenses 375.5 352.3 Operating results 82.9 7 7.9 Non-operating items (117.9) 79.5 Changes in defined benefit postretirement plans, other than periodic expense, net of tax 29.4 5.6 Change in unrestricted equity (5.6) 163.0 Change in donor restricted equity 0.1 (0.1) Change in association equity (5.5) 162.9 Association equity at year-end $ 889.4 $ 894.9 Employees at year-end 1,267 1,206 AMA RECOVERY PLAN FOR AMERICA'S PHYSICIANS Physicians prioritize patient health and well-being above all else. Fulfilling that obligation during the COVID-19 pandemic has meant putting their own lives on the line to save others while advocating for treatments and preventive measures supported by evidence-based medical science. No matter what role they took on, or where or how they served during the most severe public health crisis in decades, every physician felt the effect of the pandemic\u2014 and dealt with the consequences of a health care system stretched to its breaking point. The AMA responded with the Recovery Plan for America's Physicians, a five-point strategy to support and strengthen our nation's physician workforce. Introduced at the Annual Meeting of the AMA House of Delegates in June 2022, the AMA continues to make progress in each of the five priorities: Fixing prior authorization to reduce the burden on practices and minimize patient care delays Reforming the Medicare payment system to ensure financial stability and predictability Stopping scope of practice creep that puts patient safety at risk Reducing physician burnout and addressing the stigma around mental and behavioral health Supporting telehealth to extend gains in coverage and payment 2 | 2022 AMA Annual Report AMA RECOVERY PLAN FOR AMERICA'S PHYSICIANS 2022 AMA Annual Report | 3Fixing prior authorization The Improving Seniors' Timely Access to Care Act, the bipartisan effort to ease prior authorization burdens under the Medicare Advantage program, garnered 326 co-sponsors before it was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives in September. Its provisions were developed from the consensus statement on prior authorization reform that the AMA helped draft. The AMA represented the interests of physicians in a federal regulatory task force exploring methods to streamline the prior authorization process. The AMA also played a key role in the successful adoption of prior authorization reform laws in five states and laid the groundwork for 2023 reform efforts in dozens more states.The AMA's progress on these goals in 2022 set the stage for even greater success in the future.Reforming the Medicare payment system The AMA has been leading a multiyear effort to bring about Medicare payment models that give physicians greater flexibility in care delivery, minimize administrative burdens that detract from patient care, and improve the financial viability of physician practices. In 2022, we led a robust advocacy campaign that was joined by more than 150 organizations representing more than 1 million physicians that succeeded in minimizing the 8.5% cuts slated for 2023. The fight is far from over. Although physicians face a 2% reduction in Medicare payment in 2023, AMA advocacy efforts helped secure a two-year postponement of the 4% cuts from the pay-as-you-go sequester tied to the American Rescue Plan Act. The AMA continues to advocate for comprehensive Medicare payment reform and a rational system that is clinically relevant, less administratively burdensome, provides real opportunities for participation in new payment models, and provides stability and financial viability for large and small, as well as urban and rural, physician practices. Principles developed by the AMA to guide Medicare payment reform were endorsed by more than 1 20 medical societies.Fighting scope creep The AMA scored more than 40 state-level victories by working in partnership with state medical associations and national medical specialty societies. Pressing the fight for patient safety, we stopped bills that would have expanded the scope of practice for nurse practitioners and other APRNs, helped defeat legislation nationwide that would have allowed physician assistants to practice independently without physician oversight, and turned away measures allowing pharmacists to prescribe medications and optometrists to perform surgery. The AMA continues to aggressively urge the Department of Veterans Affairs to reject the inappropriate scope of practice expansions outlined in the Federal Supremacy Project while advocating as strongly as ever in favor of physician-led teams and against improper scope expansions in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. 4 | 2022 AMA Annual Report Supporting telehealth gains As evidenced by its tremendous growth during the COVID-19 pandemic, the AMA believes telehealth is a crucial element of effective health care delivery. That's why we continue to work to expand telehealth research, resources and policies while boosting the tools, support and expertise we offer physicians looking to integrate telehealth services into their practices without financial risks or penalties. The AMA played a key role in securing passage of legislation to extend Medicare telehealth flexibilities through the end of 2024. We also launched model legislation that states can use to advance telehealth coverage and policies, and further supported telehealth expansion by producing curated webinars, hosting interactive information exchanges and virtual discussion sessions, and by expanding our already-impressive library of print and online resources promoting evidence-based telehealth services to now include strategies to advance health equity in virtual care.Reducing physician burnout The AMA helped secure enactment of the Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Act, which enables a broad range of essential physician wellness resources, including evidence-based programs dedicated to improving mental health and resiliency. In addition, the AMA helped build coalitions to strip away stigmatizing questions about mental health and substance abuse disorders on licensure applications. Multiple medical boards and health systems made changes based on AMA recommendations. The AMA also continues to advance strategies organizations can employ to boost professional satisfaction and personal well-being. Finally, the AMA continues to provide tools to address the contributors to burnout in its STEPS Forward series, including a Saving Time Playbook, and a toolkit to address disproportionate impact on patients and physicians called Racial and Health Equity: Concrete STEPS for Health Systems. 2022 AMA Annual Report | 56 | 2022 AMA Annual Report The AMA expanded its work in promoting physician wellness through its Joy in Medicine Health System Recognition Program, honoring nearly 30 health care organizations that represented more than 80,000 physicians. In the face of a worsening drug-related overdose and death epidemic, the AMA continued to fight to remove barriers to evidence-based care for people with substance use disorders, patients with pain and increase access to harm reduction initiatives. Thanks, in part, to AMA advocacy, Congress removed the federal \"X-waiver\" requirement to prescribe buprenorphine in-office for treating opioid use disorder; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) eliminated arbitrary, numeric thresholds from its revised 2022 opioid prescribing guidelines; and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) removed barriers for harm reduction organizations to directly purchase and distribute naloxone. AMA advocacy also played a role in the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' efforts to increase health insurers' compliance with state and federal mental health and substance use disorder parity laws, as well as new laws being enacted in multiple states that decriminalized fentanyl test strips and other drug testing supplies and equipment.AMA highlights The AMA authored or co-authored a record 27 peer-reviewed journal articles and research reports in 2022 relating to physician burnout and improving professional satisfaction and practice sustainability. And the AMA Steps Forward Program exceeded 1.6 million lifetime users with new training programs that included two more playbooks, two new and 17 updated toolkits, 26 podcasts and four videos. The year 2022 was one of much progress across many meaningful initiatives led by the AMA, from advocacy to education and from health equity to blood pressure management. Here are some highlights of our organization's important work during 2022. 30 million unique visitors to our flagship website, a 1 0% increase from the record-setting performance the previous year. 2022 AMA Annual Report | 7The industry-leading AMA Ed Hub online education portal continued to expand its programs, affiliations and reach to support live broadcasts and enhance multimedia capabilities. The stable of external education providers grew by 10 to encompass 35 organizations with the addition of the American Board of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, among others. The AMA, led by its Center for Health Equity, strengthened its physician engagement with the launch of seven new educational modules published on the AMA Ed Hub learning platform that focus on strategies to advance equity through quality and safety improvements. The AMA launched the \"In Full Health Learning and Action Community to Advance Equitable Health in Innovation\" initiative, building upon the expertise of 17 external collaborations to create three AMA Ed Hub learning modules and the \"Equitable Health Innovation Solutions\" toolkit. The AMA developed an mpox resource page to provide physicians with updated information on testing access, vaccines and therapeutics, and worked with the FDA and CDC on a webinar detailing the tecovirimat (TPOXX) antiviral. And the AMA again collaborated on the annual bilingual \"Get My Flu Shot/Vacunate Contra la Influenza\" campaign, and kept physicians and the public up to date on the latest pandemic developments, including therapeutics and the importance of staying on track with COVID-19 vaccines. 6 million views on our AMA Ed Hub digital education platform. The launch of the AMA's new Current Procedural Terminology (CPT\u00ae) Developer Program helped creators of health technology and services convert ideas and leverage AMA-published content into transformative innovations. A new self-service portal gave physicians the ability to license CPT code sets through a simple pay model, including new codes introduced in 2022 relating to the mpox outbreak and ongoing releases for specific COVID-19 vaccines. The AMA also developed revised versions of an initial 20 illustrations for the 2023 CPT PRO Book, reflecting the diversity of our patients. 8 | 2022 AMA Annual Report The AMA's community support included an additional $3 million multi-year commitment to West Side United, a community- based collaborative that is addressing determinants of health and reshaping economic vitality on Chicago's West Side. First published in March 2022 as part of the AMA's MedEd Innovation Series, the \"Coaching in Medical Education Handbook\" quickly sold out. Now in its second printing, this instructor-focused guide outlines a scientific foundation for coaching competency and has ranked in the top 100 of medical education and training books since its release. The AMA published \"Protecting the Education Mission During Sustained Disruption\" in 2022, a report that explores organizational strategies to support educators amid extreme stress and which formed the basis of the Educator Well-Being in Academic Medicine book published in December. In cases ranging from COVID-19 standards of care to firearm regulations, the AMA continued to fight for physicians and patients in state and federal courts in 2022. The AMA was a plaintiff in African American Tobacco Control Leadership Council v. HHS, which forced the federal government to take the first steps toward banning menthol cigarettes.AMA highlights (continued) 2.7 million YouTube views 2\u00d7 the total from 2021. To close the gap in blood pressure management training within medical schools, the AMA launched a three-part eLearning series, supported by a one-year grant program to monitor the impact of this new training. AMA policy guidance led to four state Medicaid programs increasing access for self-measured blood pressure by covering home-use devices and clinical support services. AMA added four more health care organizations to its growing list of AMA MAP BP implementation sites and announced exciting results of one implementation site, Cook County Health on Chicago's West Side, which reported that blood pressure control rates increased by 13 percentage points across 11 practice sites. Additionally, the AMA also trained more than 100 community health workers to help Chicago's West Side residents more accurately measure their blood pressure at home.The AMA expanded its national Behavioral Health Collaborative with the launch of the Behavioral Health Integration Immersion Program, a 12-month curriculum that provides enhanced technical assistance to physician practices seeking to deliver integrated care to patients. This effort builds on the success of the Overcoming Obstacles series with several new webinars on topics such as assembling a behavioral health integration care team and addressing physician and patient mental health. The AMA relaunched its popular Physician Innovation Network digital platform, which now has more than 18,000 collaborators and 30 industry partners, to improve user experience and more effectively connect physicians with technology innovators. Following up on extensive research that identified the benefits physicians valued most in a disability product, AMA Insurance launched two popular enhancements to this line, including a level-rated premium. 2022 AMA Annual Report | 9The AMA joined an Association of American Medical Colleges-led U.S. Supreme Court amicus brief in the Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard and Students for Fair Admissions v. University of North Carolina cases in support of the consideration of race in higher education admissions. Together with the American Academy of Pediatrics, the AMA submitted an amicus brief urging the U.S. Supreme Court to uphold the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) of 1978. And in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision, the AMA joined numerous briefs promoting access to reproductive care and opposing government interference in the patient-physician relationship.600,000 AMA podcast downloads 175 billion AMA media impressions representing $1.6 billion in estimated advertising value to the organization.10 | 2022 AMA Annual Report Management's discussion and analysis 2022 AMA Annual Report | 11The AMA, like all other organizations, recognized in early 2020 that there was substantial uncertainty about the effects and risk of COVID-19 on our funding, financial condition, and results of operations. As a result, AMA took steps to ensure that programmatic activities and employment levels would be protected during a sustained pandemic, knowing the potential for economic uncertainty, including a freeze on hiring and elimination of travel, among other measures. AMA lifted the freeze on hiring in the spring of 2021, but the level of open positions remained high through 2022 due to the very tight job market. The lower staffing levels and limited travel garnered substantial savings. These savings are temporary in nature and drove unusually high operating income for AMA during 2020 through 2022 but are not expected to recur after full return to normal activities in 2023. Pro forma net operating results (in millions) AMA's 2023 budget assumes that these temporary savings will not recur, and coupled with expansion of certain programmatic areas, expenses will increase to normal levels, resulting in operating income at the board-approved policy level. The AMA is committed to its responsibility of ensuring that the organization focuses its finite resources on core mission activities and strategic arcs while improving the quality and breadth of products and services for physicians and medical students. Our physicians' and medical students' voices are central to AMA's overall success. The following pages discuss the 2022 consolidated financial results as compared to 2021. Additional detailed discussion of operating unit results is included in the section titled \"Group Operating Results.\" 12 | 2022 AMA Annual Report Introduction The objective of this section is to help American Medical Association (AMA) members and other readers of our financial statements understand management's views on the AMA's financial condition and results of operations. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements. Improving the health of the nation is at the core of the AMA's work. As physicians' powerful ally in patient care, the AMA delivers on this goal by representing physicians with a unified voice in courts and legislative bodies across the nation, removing the largest governmental and private sector obstacles that interfere with optimal patient care, leading the charge to prevent chronic disease and confront public health crises, and driving the future of medicine to tackle the biggest challenges in health care and training the leaders of tomorrow. AMA's strategic arcs are supported by improving health outcomes, lifelong medical education and enhancing physician professional satisfaction and practice sustainability. Our advocacy, health equity and innovation initiatives act as accelerators across all arcs. AMA's foundation is built on science, membership, financial performance, talent and engagement. 2022 accomplishments were led by the launch of the AMA Recovery Plan for America's Physicians, an ambitious roadmap to renewing our country's commitment to physicians\u2014and ensuring their needs are met\u2014so patients can receive the high-quality care they deserve. The plan focuses on five key goals to re-build health care so that it works better for physicians and all those they serve: 1) fixing prior authorization to reduce the burden on practices and minimize care delays for patients; 2) reforming Medicare payment to promote thriving physician practices and innovation; 3) stopping scope creep that threatens patient safety; 4) reducing physician burnout and addressing the stigma around mental health; and 5) supporting telehealth to maintain coverage and payment. Advocacy results included achieving more than 35 state-level scope of practice victories in partnership with the Federation and extending telehealth coverage into 2024, as well as minimizing the impact of the scheduled 8.5 percent Medicare payment cuts. Professional Satisfaction and Practice Sustainability expanded its successful programs to reduce burnout in health systems, based on peer-reviewed studies and research. Management's discussion and analysis *Excluding the In 2022, total revenue improved by $33.7 million over the prior year, due to continued growth in AMA's royalties and a one- time recognition of $14.3 million in deferred revenue from a customer contract in a subsidiary company of Health2047 , Inc. (Health2047) upon liquidation of the subsidiary. Most other revenue categories were either slightly down or unchanged for the year. Consolidated investment income, which is dividend and interest income, net of management fees, increased in 2022, impacted in large part by higher interest rates. Market gains or losses are not included in investment income and are reported as non-operating results. The number of AMA dues-paying members decreased slightly in 2022 by 0.9 percent, after 11 years of consecutive growth in membership. During that 11-year period, AMA dues-paying membership increased by more than 75,000. Dues revenue decreased by 2.9 percent as growth in lower dues paying categories such as group memberships and sponsored memberships partially offset the decline in individual direct member categories. Cost of products sold and selling expenses All variable expenses related to the production, distribution and sale of periodicals, books, coding products and licensed products are included in the cost of products sold and selling expense categories. Examples include paper, sales commissions, promotional activities, distribution costs and third-party editorial costs. In 2022, cost of products sold and selling expenses increased $4.7 million from the prior year, of which $2.7 million was for one-time recognition of deferred costs related to the Health2047 subsidiary's recognition of deferred revenue noted above. The remaining increase was largely a function of commodity price and postal rate increases for paper and distribution. Contribution to general and administrative expenses Cost of products sold and selling expenses are deducted from revenues to determine the amount of money available for the general and administrative expenses of the organization. Contribution to general and administrative expenses measures the gross margin derived from revenue-producing activities. The contribution to general and administrative expenses increased $29 million to $462.8 million in 2022, with revenue improvements from royalties and the one-time recognition of the Health2047 subsidiary's deferred revenue and costs accounting for most of the change.Consolidated financial results Results from operations Net operating results (in millions) As noted above, the unusually tight labor market that adversely impacted hiring and limited travel and in-person meetings in the first half of 2022 were major factors in spending levels running $40 million less than budget. At the same time, recurring revenue rose by approximately $19 million. In addition, the liquidation of a subsidiary and recognition of one-time deferred revenue and costs added $11.6 million to the 2022 net results. Looking ahead to 2023, AMA does not expect to attain the same level of expense savings and future results are expected to be more modest. In 2019, the AMA finalized termination of its defined benefit pension plan, providing lump sum payments to individuals that elected that option and purchasing a group annuity plan for participants that chose to remain in the plan. AMA recorded a $38.2 million noncash reclassification of prior actuarial losses from non-operating expense to operating expense, titled pension termination expense, as well as reclassifying a $2 million noncash tax benefit to income tax expense that was previously reported as a non-operating credit. Excluding the $36.2 million noncash pension termination expense (net of the $2 million tax credit), AMA would have reported $23.4 million in net operating income for 2019. Results discussed below reflect AMA's actual results from operations in 2022 as compared to 2021. Any pro forma charts exclude the impact of the pension termination on 2019 results.$21.1 $0.5 million in 2022, due in part to Advocacy conducting a bi-annual Physician Practice Expense survey as well as costs for the \"Stop Medicare Cuts\" campaign early in 2022. A $5.2 million increase in other operating expenses was driven by a $2.2 million increase in grants and contributions, of which a $1 million increase is for various grants sponsored by the Center for Health Equity and a $0.7 million increase is for the Accelerating Change in Medical Education (ACE) Consortium grants. Continued growth in the use of online solutions across a number of business units, as well as price increases, resulted in online product subscription costs increasing $1.7 million during 2022. Operating results before income taxes The AMA reported $87.3 million in pre-tax operating income in 2022 compared to $81.5 million in 2021. Both years reflect substantially reduced expenses due to pandemic restrictions on travel and meetings, staffing freezes and tight labor markets. A $33.7 million increase in revenue was only partially reduced by cost of products sold and general and administrative expense increases described above. Income taxes Taxes increased $0.8 million in 2022 when compared to 2021. The 2021 tax provision included a $1.2 million credit reflecting a reversal of a previously established reserve for taxes deemed unnecessary due to completion of tax audits. The absence of the credit in 2022 was partially offset by the effect of lower taxable income in one of the subsidiaries. Net operating results Net operating income was $82.9 million in 2022 compared to $77.9 million in 2021, driven mainly by improved revenues net of expense increases. Non-operating items The AMA reported a $115.1 million loss in the fair value of its portfolio during 2022 after an $82.8 million gain in 2021. Additional portfolio performance information is discussed in the group operating results section. As a result of an accounting standard adopted in 2019 for postretirement benefit plans, non-operating results include $3.5 million and $3.9 million in postretirement plan interest expense and recognized actuarial losses and prior service credits for 2022 and 2021, respectively. Pro forma general and administrative expenses (in millions) General and administrative expenses rose only $23.2 million in 2022, or 6.6 percent, when compared to 2021. This was substantially less than the budgeted increase for 2022, with nonrecurring savings related to staffing, professional services and travel. Compensation and benefits were largely unchanged in 2022, increasing $1.4 million, or less than one percent. Compensation, including temporary help, was $5.8 million higher in 2022, a 3.6 percent increase which was mainly a function of annual merit increases. Fringe benefit costs increased $2.5 million in total primarily due to higher medical and payroll tax expenses, continuing a post-pandemic trend from 2021. Recruiting costs also increased as an unusually large number of open positions were under recruitment in 2022. Incentive compensation declined $7.8 million, offsetting most of the above increases, as some key performance indicators were not achieved in 2022 and others were met but not exceeded. Occupancy costs were up slightly as operating costs rose with a return to office in late 2022 as well as the impact of higher property taxes. In late 2022, AMA exercised a contraction option in the main headquarters lease whereby AMA will relinquish one full floor of office space beginning in 2023 upon payment of a termination penalty. The cash savings over the remaining lease period, including operating expenses and property taxes and net of the penalty, are estimated to be in excess of $8 million. Travel and meeting costs increased by $11.1 million in 2022, as AMA resumed in-person meetings and travel mid-year. Technology costs were up $1.5 million in 2022, largely related to continued development of the AMA Ed Hub, JAMA Network initiatives and implementation of the Insurance Agency's new policy administration system. Marketing and promotion costs rose $3.2 million in 2022, mainly for marketing and media costs related to the launch of AMA's Recovery Plan for America's Physicians and membership solicitation. 14 | 2022 AMA $0Financial position and cash flows The AMA's assets include cash, cash equivalents and investments; operating assets such as accounts receivable, inventory and prepaid expenses; fixed capital such as equipment, computer hardware and software; and other assets. AMA assets are supported by association equity, operating liabilities and deferred revenue. Assets (in millions) The AMA's total assets decreased $74.1 million in 2022. This includes a $72 million decrease in cash and investments resulting from $45.4 million in free cash flow minus a $115.1 million loss in the fair value of investment securities and $2.3 million for investments in affiliates. Fiduciary funds are premium payments from insurance customers not yet remitted to the carriers and funds held by the AMA for third parties for future use as approved by the third parties. This approximates the offsetting liability titled insurance premiums and other fiduciary funds payable. Operating assets increased $12.7 million in 2022, primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses. Changes in operating assets from year to year are largely due to timing of cash flows. Other assets includes operating lease right-of-use assets, property and equipment and investments in mutual funds maintained in separate accounts designated for various nonqualified benefit plans that are not available for operations. Operating lease right-of-use assets decreased due to amortization of the asset over the life of the lease as well as the impact from the headquarters' lease contraction noted above. Property and equipment net book value also decreased as new capital spending was exceeded by annual depreciation and amortization of existing capital assets. Revenue (less than) in excess of expenses Expenses exceeded revenues by $35 million in 2022, a combination of $82.9 million in operating income, the $115.1 million loss in fair value in the portfolio and $2.8 million in other non-operating expenses. Revenues exceeded expenses by $157.4 million in 2021, a combination of $77.9 million in operating income, an $82.8 million gain in fair value in the portfolio and $3.3 million in other non-operating expenses. Accounting standards require organizations to recognize deferred actuarial losses and prior service credits or charges for defined benefit postretirement plans as a charge or credit to equity. In 2022, AMA recorded a $29.4 million credit to equity reflecting an actuarial gain for the postretirement health care plan, net of a reclassification of actuarial losses for the plan to operating expense and income tax. The gain resulted primarily from higher interest rates reducing the present value of plan liabilities. In 2021, AMA recorded a $5.6 million credit to equity reflecting an actuarial gain for the postretirement health care plan, net of a reclassification of actuarial losses and prior service credits for the plan to operating expense and income tax. The gain resulted from higher interest rates and changes in participants, offset by an increase in baseline claims costs. Change in total association equity (in millions) The AMA reported a $5.5 million decrease in association equity in 2022. This reflects the amount by which expenses exceeded revenues, plus the credit to equity for changes in defined benefit postretirement plans discussed above, as well as a small increase in donor-restricted equity. The AMA reported a $162.9 million increase in association equity in 2021. This reflects the amount by which revenues exceeded expenses, plus the credit to equity for changes in defined benefit postretirement plans discussed above, as well as a small decrease in donor-restricted equity. 2022 AMA Annual and investments n Fiduciary funds n Operating assets n Other assets$1,500 $1,200 $900 $600 $300 $0Reserve portfolio Reserves (in millions) The reserves and operating funds above do not include cash and investments in the for-profit subsidiaries and reflect only the not-for-profit entity's cash and investment portfolio values. As of year-end 2022, the reserve portfolio's value was $841.4 million compared to $887.6 million in 2021, a $46.2 million decrease. That decrease was mainly the result of a $108.1 million loss in the fair value of the reserve portfolio offset by a $61.5 million transfer of 2021 excess operating funds to reserves. Operating funds totaled $84.9 million in 2022, down $27.7 million from 2021. The AMA has established a required minimum reserve investment portfolio level that is adequate to cover 100 percent of annual general and administrative expenses (excluding grant expenses) plus an amount sufficient to pay long-term postretirement and lease liabilities (net of the right-of-use asset value). Operating funds, coupled with operating assets, are to be maintained at a level that allows payment of all current operating liabilities. The minimum reserve portfolio level is designed to ensure that the AMA can always meet its long-term obligations, as well as provide that the AMA could continue operations for at least one year in the case of a catastrophic occurrence.Operating liabilities decreased $52.6 million in 2022, led by decreases in the postretirement health care plan liabilities, lease liability and accrued payroll. The postretirement health care plan liability decrease was a function of the impact of higher interest rates on the present value of plan liabilities. The lease liability change includes a $2.3 million reduction in the present value of the headquarters liability resulting from exercising the contraction option noted above. Deferred revenue represents funds received during the year that will not be recognized as income until the following year or thereafter. These amounts vary, as well as accounts payable and accrued expenses, depending on the timing of cash receipts and payments. Cash flows Cash, cash equivalents and donor-restricted cash increased $1.4 million in 2022 and decreased $2.9 million in 2021. This comparison may cause misleading conclusions, as the change in cash and cash equivalents includes reductions for amounts invested in marketable securities, as well as cash inflows from non-operating activities. Free cash flow measures the AMA's ability to fund operations, capital expenses and major programmatic initiatives from funds generated from operations. This measure excludes non- operating gains and losses. Free cash (in millions) Free cash in 2022 totaled $45.4 million, substantially less than the 2021 results, driven mainly by changes in operating assets and liabilities. 16 | 2022 AMA Annual The contribution margin generated by Membership; Publishing, Health Solutions & Insurance; as well as Investments, provides the funding for all mission-related activities of the AMA as well as funding for all administration and support operations required to run the organization. Membership The Membership group's total revenue includes both net membership dues and interest expense on lifetime memberships. Net membership dues include the gross dues revenue collected, reduced by any commissions paid to state societies, and equal the membership dues revenue reported on the statement of activities. After 11 consecutive years of increases in the number of dues-paying members, AMA experienced a small decrease in total membership in 2022, as the number of dues paying members declined by 0.9 percent. This was driven largely by a drop in student membership which was unfavorably impacted by limitations on in-person recruiting on campuses, while physician membership held steady. Membership continues to focus on expanding use of digital tools to engage physicians and retain them as lifelong members, group membership marketing, and more effectively reaching physicians through expanded programmatic activities. Dues revenue was $33.8 million, a $1 million decrease from 2021. Although the number of physician memberships remained steady, growth in lower dues paying categories was only partially offset by the decline in individual direct member categories. Interest expense on lifetime memberships was $0.1 million in 2022 and zero in 2021. Membership substantially expanded its marketing and solicitation efforts during 2022, with a $1.9 million increase in marketing costs, accounting for most of the $2.5 million cost increase. Membership's contribution margin decreased $3.6 million in 2022, a combination of the revenue decline and cost increases.Reserve portfolio funds also provide the AMA with the ability to fund major strategic spending initiatives not within the operating budget. Spending from the reserve funds is limited to the amount by which reserves exceed the minimum requirement. The Board of Trustees must authorize any use of reserves. Permanent reserves and minimum reserve requirement (in millions) Group operating results The AMA is organized into various operating groups: Membership; Publishing, Health Solutions & Insurance; Strategic Arcs & Core Mission Activities; Administration and Operations; Affiliated Organizations; Unallocated Overhead; and Health2047 (including subsidiaries). Revenues and expenses directly attributed to those units are included in the group operating results. A financial summary of group operating results is presented at the end of this section. Prior year financial results have been restated to be consistent with the current year reported results for each group. Contribution margin (net expenses) Contribution margin equals individual group revenues minus cost of products sold, selling expenses, and direct general and administrative expenses such as compensation, occupancy, travel and meetings, technology costs and professional services. Net expenses equals total spending, net of any revenue produced by the group, such as grants or other fee income. Total contribution margin and net expenses equals consolidated operating results before income taxes. The charts below separate groups with contribution margin from groups with net expenses. 2022 AMA Annual Report | 17$400 $300 $200 $100 $0 n Publishing, Health Solutions & Insurance n Investments n Membership $841.4 $541.3 Permanent reserves \u2014 two for-profit subsidiaries, the AMA Insurance Agency (Agency) and Health2047. The latter is discussed separately at the end of this discussion and analysis. The Agency's revenues declined by $1.6 million in 2022, mainly due to a second decrease in commission rates to protect the viability of the plan, which allowed the Agency to avoid charging higher premiums to physician customers. The Agency, as broker, receives a commission on insurance policies sold. Expenses were up $0.6 million mainly due to technology costs related to development of a new customer facing platform. The contribution margin declined to $17.8 million from $20 million in the prior year. Other business operations net expenses were up $1.3 million in 2022, which included $0.7 million in one-time costs. In total, Publishing, Health Solutions & Insurance contribution margin was $298.8 million, up $11.3 million from 2021. Investments (AMA-only) AMA-only investment income includes dividend and interest earnings on the AMA's portfolio. Investment income in AMA's active subsidiaries is included as part of the group results for Publishing, Health Solutions & Insurance and Health2047. Investments' revenue was $14.1 million in 2022, a $2.8 million increase over the prior year. Dividend and interest income continued to improve in 2022, impacted in part by higher interest rates. The contribution margin also increased by $2.8 million as expenses were unchanged. The net gain or loss on the market value of investments is not included in operating results but reported as a non-operating item. This amount is in addition to the investment income discussed above. In 2022, AMA reported a net loss of $115.1 million, compared to an $82.8 million gain in 2021. The total investment return, including investment income, on the reserve portfolios was negative 10.5 percent, better than the 13.1 percent loss in the composite benchmark index.Publishing, Health Solutions & Insurance Publications in the JAMA Network include the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) and the JAMA Network specialty journals. In recent years, the JAMA Network has launched four new journals: JAMA Oncology in 2015 and JAMA Cardiology in 2016, which are hybrid journals offering open access options for research articles; JAMA Network Ope n in 2018, a fully open access journal; and JAMA Health Forum in 2021, a peer-reviewed, open-access, online journal focused on health policy, health care systems, and global and public health. Publishing revenues are derived from advertising, subscriptions, site licensing, reprints, electronic licensing, open access fees and royalties. Publishing revenues decreased $1.8 million in 2022, with declines in most revenue lines except open access fees. The prior year had included two large one-time purchases of reprints and journal backfiles totaling $2.4 million which accounted for most of the decline. Expenses rose $5.2 million during 2022, with approximately $1.3 million related to inflationary cost increases on paper, printing and distribution. The remaining cost increases occurred across most expense categories. The contribution margin thus declined by $7 million to $2.1 million. Health Solutions includes two major lines: Database Products, and Books and Digital Content. Database Products includes royalties from licensed data sales and credentialing products revenue. Revenues increased in 2022, up $3.5 million when compared to 2021, driven in large part by a major compliance effort to upgrade existing customer contracts from development contracts to full licenses. Expenses were up $1.1 million driven by higher compensation, increased technology costs and resumption of travel. The resulting contribution margin rose by $2.4 million in 2022 to $54.3 million. AMA-published books and coding products, such as CPT\u00ae books, workshops and licensed data files, make up the Books and Digital Content unit. Revenues in this unit increased by $18.6 million. Royalties and digital content sales drove this increase, as the market for electronic use of digital coding products continues to expand. Phasing in previous pricing model changes was also a factor. Coding book sales declined slightly in 2022 as the move from print products to digital continues to adversely impact print product sales. Expenses were down slightly in 2022, driven by reduced use of outside professional services. The contribution margin increased by $19.4 million to $228.5 million. 18 | 2022 AMA Annual Report 20 states to help them implement AMA M.A.P . BP . Additionally, the AMA is currently testing new ways to disseminate M.A.P . BP through population health channel partnerships to help serve health care organizations that care for historically marginalized and minoritized populations. Net expenses were unchanged in 2022. Advancing Professional Development includes Medical Education/ACE and the AMA Ed Hub. While the undergraduate medical school consortium grants successfully concluded in 2018, all 32 consortium schools have continued collaboration and new schools have been added to the ACE Consortium each year through focused innovation grants. The consortium of schools has been substantially expanded and now acts as a learning collaborative so that best practices can be developed, shared and implemented in medical schools across the country. In 2019, the methods and learning from the undergraduate consortium initiative were extended to a new multi-year grant program on graduate medical education, designed to improve the transition from undergraduate to graduate medical education and to maintain and reinforce the positive changes initiated by the undergraduate consortium work. One of the key outcomes of the ACE Consortium was the development of Health Systems Science, a foundational platform and framework for the study and understanding of how care is delivered, how health professionals work together to deliver that care, and how the health system can improve patient care and health care delivery. In 2022, Medical Education convened its first Precision Education Summit with a goal of advancing a conceptual model of precision education to optimize lifelong learning for physicians. This will be the next phase of AMA's critical education transformation. Medical Education is also responsible for defining or influencing standards for undergraduate, graduate and continuing medical education and providing support for the Council on Medical Education. Net expenses increased $1.4 million in 2022 reflecting resumption of in-person meetings and travel as well as payment of ACE grants previously deferred during the pandemic. The AMA Ed Hub, formally launched in 2018, is a platform providing physicians and other health care providers content and educational services that support lifelong professional development. The AMA Ed Hub has unified the AMA education portfolio and has piloted integration of external content providers, launched new content sets and established internal development plans enterprise-wide, including the Health Equity Education Center and the UME Curricular Enrichment Program. The AMA Ed Hub also gives doctors and other health professionals a streamlined way to earn, track and report continuing medical education activities spanning clinical, Net expenses Strategic Arcs (in millions) The Strategic Arcs include direct costs associated with the groups for Improving Health Outcomes (IHO), Medical Education including Accelerating Change in Medical Education (ACE), the AMA Ed Hub and Professional Satisfaction and Practice Sustainability (PS2). IHO focuses on confronting two of the nation's most prevalent issues: cardiovascular disease and type-2 diabetes, setting a course of innovation and action aimed at reducing the disease and cost burden associated with these selected conditions. To help prevent type-2 diabetes, the AMA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed a toolkit to help health care teams screen, test and refer at-risk patients to in-person or online diabetes prevention programs (DPPs). In 2022, the AMA completed a six-year public awareness campaign with the CDC and the Ad Council, reaching 12.5 million individuals who took an online prediabetes risk test. The AMA has developed online tools and resources using the latest evidence-based information to support physicians to help manage their patients' high blood pressure (BP). In 2022, to improve the identified gap in BP measurement training in medical schools, IHO developed a three-part e-learning series and hosted a grant program to help embed and monitor the success of the training. The main focus during 2022 was on hypertension outcome goals as progress continues on implementation of cloud-based M.A.P . BP (a three-step program that works to diagnose and manage patients with hypertension) dashboards at health care organizations (HCOs), providing a visual representation of their performance on five key blood pressure metrics, including stratification by ethnicity, race, and gender.

Advocacy includes federal and state level advocacy to enact laws and advance regulations on issues important to patients and physicians; economic, statistical and market research to support advocacy efforts; political education for physicians; grassroots advocacy; and maintaining relations with the federation of medicine. Advocacy led a campaign (Reforming Medicare Pay) joined by more than 150 other organizations that helped minimize the 8.5 percent in Medicare payment cuts originally slated for 2023, and continuing to urge Congress for long-term, systemic reform through the AMA's coalition. Other major initiatives included: supporting telehealth by extending Medicare telehealth coverage through 2024; fighting scope creep by achieving more than 35 state-level scope of practice victories in strong collaboration with Federation partners; reducing physician burnout by advocating in support of passage of the Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Act, which provides essential physician wellness resources and by leading a national campaign that enacted multiple state laws, changed licensing and changed credentialing questions; and tackling prior authorization by successfully advocating for unanimous passage of a federal Medicare Advantage prior authorization reform bill in one chamber during the 117th Congress, and helping to enact prior authorization reform laws in Michigan, Georgia and Iowa. In 2022, Advocacy net spending increased $2.8 million, primarily compensation expenses, travel and meeting costs as in-person meetings resumed as well as campaign costs to stop Medicare cuts. Health, Science & Ethics is involved in developing AMA policies on scientific, public health and ethical issues for the House of Delegates (HOD) providing leadership, subject matter expertise and scientifically sound content and evidence that underpins and informs both current and future AMA initiatives in areas such as infectious disease, drug policy and opioid prescribing; overseeing maintenance of the AMA Code of Medical Ethics and publication of the AMA Journal of Ethics, AMA's online ethics journal; and managing the United States Adopted Names (USAN) program, responsible for selecting generic names for drugs by establishing logical nomenclature classifications based on pharmacological or chemical relationships (reported separately in Group Operating Results). This group continued to lead the AMA's COVID-19 efforts during 2022 by providing subject matter expertise and content, and in conjunction with the Ad Council and CDC, updated and launched the annual campaign to get vaccinated against seasonal flu. Net expenses increased $0.5 million in 2022, due to limited staff expansion and higher costs in the grant administration unit.practice transformation and professionalism topics. The number of external education providers on the platform grew by ten organizations to 35 organizations in 2022. Net expenses were up $2.5 million in 2022 due largely to growth in staffing and enhancements to the technology platform, including features to support live broadcasting and advance multi-media, as well as expanding real-time credit submission to four additional medical boards. PS2 includes three major streams of work: professional satisfaction/practice transformation, practice sustainability, and digital health all designed to improve the day-to-day practice and professional experience of physicians and remove obstacles to care. The goals of this group are to promote successful models in both the public and private sectors. This includes expanding research of credible practice science, creating tools and other solutions to help guide physicians, care teams and health system leaders on developing and implementing strategies to optimize practice efficiencies, reduce burnout and improve professional well-being; ensuring the physician perspective is represented in the design, implementation and evaluation of new health care technologies; and shaping the evolution of payment models for sustainability and satisfaction. In 2022, 220,000 physicians were the direct beneficiaries of PS2 services/interventions, as measured by the number of physicians within participating HCOs utilizing organizational/ burnout assessments; within participating HCOs in collaborative training and/or coaching efforts; and within HCOs recognized by the Joy in Medicine Health System Recognition Program. In addition, PS2 launched the Private Practice Simple Solutions Initiative and also led and funded the Behavioral Health Integration (BHI) Collaborative of Federation members to design and launch the BHI Immersion Program. In 2022, net expenses increased $0.6 million, driven almost entirely by staffing and travel costs.

The launch of AMA's Recovery Plan for America's Physicians alone generated nearly five million website users. Net expenses increased $3.3 million in 2022, largely staffing and media marketing expenses for the recovery plan launch. Ongoing responsibilities of the Enterprise Communications area include amplifying the work of individual operating units among their core audiences while providing consistency and alignment with the AMA narrative. Enterprise Communications distinctly communicates AMA's leading voice in science to embed equity, innovation and advocacy across the AMA's strategic work throughout health care. Net expenses were up $0.4 million in 2022, mainly related to activities celebrating AMA's 175th anniversary. Governance Governance includes the Board of Trustees and Board Operations, the HOD, Sections and Special Constituencies & International units. The Board of Trustees unit includes costs related to governance activities as well as expenses associated with support of the Strategic Arcs and Core Mission Activities. The HOD, Sections and Special Constituencies & International unit includes costs associated with annual and interim meetings, groups and sections and other HOD activities, as well as costs associated with AMA's involvement in the World Medical Association. In 2022, Governance net spending was up $5.6 million, mainly for resumption of in-person meeting and travel costs. Administration and Operations (in millions) These units provide administrative and operational support for Publishing & Health Solutions, Membership, Strategic Arcs and Core Mission Activities, as well as other operating groups. Net expenses were up slightly in 2022, an increase of $1.8 million, or 2.5 percent, mainly inflationary cost increases. The AMA recognized that a key to long-term success in our strategic arcs is increasing our efforts to reduce health and health care disparities. As a result of a 2018 task force report, the AMA sought leadership to embed health equity initiatives as relevant into all strategic priorities and areas of the organization, creating a new group, the Center for Health Equity (CHE). The focus of this group is to elevate AMA's public role and responsibilities to improve health equity. In 2022, CHE expanded its efforts to establish an AMA presence in the health equity research literature with the publication of seven Social Justice Education Ed Hub modules and the continuation of the Prioritizing Equity Series; launched the In Full Health Learning and Action Community to Advance Equitable Health in Innovation that prioritizes investment in health innovations developed by, with, and for historically marginalized communities; launched the Peer Network for Advancing Equity through quality and safety in collaboration with Brigham & Women's Hospital and The Joint Commission to help health systems apply an equity lens to all aspects of quality and safety practices; and announced Rise to Health, a national coalition for equity in health care, co-led with the Institute for Healthcare Improvement. CHE also established AMA as an anchor mission partner for a collaborative on Chicago's west side, West Side United, and continued building staff capacity to understand concepts surrounding health equity and to operationalize equity in goal and metric setting and developing structural competency learning tools. The continued planned growth of CHE resulted in a $5.9 million increase in net expenses in 2022. IHMI brings together experts from patient care, medical terminology, and informatics around a common framework for defining and expressing health data. IHMI has been recognized as a leading authority on clinical content standards and is contributing to the development and use of clinical content through collaboration with Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR), the Gravity Project and others. In 2022, IHMI completed development of a Self- Measured Blood Pressure (SMBP) software and services solution and gathered baseline data from a pilot site related to pilot population. IHMI net expenses were largely unchanged in 2022. MMX extends the reach and impact of AMA's mission and advocacy initiatives and strengthens the AMA brand. MMX continues to take on increased oversight for managing the quality, timing and relevance of the experience physicians have at each point of interaction through AMA's digital publishing, health system engagement and member programs. MMX creates or packages AMA's content into digital formats and distributes AMA resources and thought leadership to intended audiences through owned and paid channels, raising awareness of AMA initiatives, resources and accomplishments and elevating the voice of AMA and physicians. In 2022, more than 30 million unique individuals accessed AMA's website, a 20 percent increase over the record number of users in the prior 2022 AMA Annual Report | 21$(100) $(75) $(50) $(25) $0 n Information Technology Health2047 has an ownership interest in nine companies, including a consolidated subsidiary, FMC, two companies accounted for using the equity method, Heal and Emergence, and six companies accounted for using the cost method, Zing, Medcurio, Phenomix, Sitebridge, RecoverX and Scholar Rx. The footnotes to AMA's financial statements include a detailed discussion on accounting for Health2047 spinoff companies. Third-party financing is expected to cover most long-term future costs for many of these companies. Health2047 revenue in 2022 was $14.3 million, compared to $1 million in 2021. In 2022, as a result of the Akiri liquidation, Health2047 recognized $14.3 million in revenue and $2.7 million in associated costs for creating a custom platform for a customer. Both revenue and expense had been received or incurred in prior years but were deferred until the project was completed or abandoned, which occurred in 2022. Costs increased $3.4 million, of which $2.7 million was the recognition of deferred costs for the custom platform. Net expenses declined by $9.9 million in 2022 to $1.4 million, primarily due to the net $11.6 million impact from recognizing the deferred revenue and expense discussed above. The summary of group operating results is included on the following page.Affiliated organizations Affiliated Organizations represent either grant or in-kind service support provided by the AMA to other foundations and societies. In some cases, the AMA is reimbursed for services provided. No net expenses were reported in 2022. Unallocated overhead The net expenses in this area include costs not allocated back to operating units such as corporate insurance and actuarial services, employee incentive compensation, valuation allowances or other reserves. In 2022, these expenses totaled $20.5 million, down from $31.1 million in 2021. Lower incentive compensation was the main factor in the decrease. Health2047 and subsidiaries AMA owns a business formation and commercialization enterprise designed to enhance AMA's ability to define, create, develop and launch, with partners, a portfolio of products and technologies that will have a profound impact on many aspects of the U.S. health care system and population health, with a central goal of helping physicians in practice. The Board of Trustees approved the use of reserves to establish this subsidiary with plans to use third-party resources to assist in funding spinoffs with commercial potential in future years. Health2047 funds initial projects and moves those that demonstrate commercial appeal into separate companies, along with necessary seed funding for the new companies. After the initial stage, it is expected that these companies should command additional investment from third parties to begin commercialization of the product, either through debt or equity financing. At some point in the future, the spinoffs will be sold or liquidated, at which time, AMA could expect to receive a financial return. Since 2017 , Health2047 has spun off or invested in 11 companies: Akiri, Inc. (Akiri), First Mile Care, Inc. (FMC), HXSquare, Inc. (HXS), Zing Health Enterprises, LP (Zing), Medcurio, Phenomix Sciences, Inc. (Phenomix), Sitebridge Research, Inc. (Sitebridge), Emergence Healthcare Group, Inc. (Emergence), Heal Security, Inc. (Heal), Recovery Exploration Technologies, Inc. (RecoverX) and Scholar Rx, Inc. (Scholar Rx). In 2022, Health2047 liquidated two of these companies, Akiri and HXS, as third-party financing efforts were unsuccessful. Upon liquidation of Akiri, there was an $11.6 million gain from recognizing deferred revenue and expense for a customer contract entered into and paid in 2017. There was no material gain or loss upon the HXS liquidation. 22 | 2022 AMA Annual Report American Medical Association group operating results Revenues Margin (expenses) (in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Membership $ 33.7 $ 34.8 $ 12.7 $ 16.3 Publishing, Health Solutions & Insurance Publishing 65.9 67.7 2.1 9.1 Database Products 66.9 63.4 Agency/Affinity Products 36.4 38.0 17. 8 20.0 Other business operations -

Nature of operations The American Medical Association (AMA) is a national professional association of physicians with approximately 275 thousand members. The AMA serves the medical community and the public through standard setting and implementation in the areas of science, medical education, improving health outcomes, health equity, delivery and payment systems, ethics, representation and advocacy, policy development, and image and identity building. The AMA provides information and services to hundreds of thousands of physicians and includes journal and book publishing, physician credentialing, database licensing, insurance and other professional services for physicians. The AMA classifies all operating results as revenues and expenses in the consolidated statements of activities. Non- operating items include net realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments, defined benefit postretirement plan non-service expense and other non-recurring income or expense. Donor-restricted association equity includes contributions restricted for use for scope of practice program which are not available for general use by AMA. 2. Significant accounting policies Consolidation policy The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the AMA and its subsidiaries, AMA Services, Inc., American Medical Assurance Company and Health2047 Inc. (collectively, the AMA). AMA, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Health2047 Inc. (Health2047), has investments in nine companies or limited partnerships as of December 31, 2022. Health2047 controls and therefore consolidates the results of two companies, First Mile Care, Inc. as well as Akiri, Inc. (Akiri). Akiri was liquidated during 2022 resulting in recognition of $14.3 million of deferred revenue, in grants and other income, and $2.7 million of deferred costs, in cost of products sold and selling expenses, related to completion of a customer contract entered into during 2017.The equity method of accounting is used to account for investments in companies or limited partnerships in which the AMA has significant influence but not overall control. The investments are initially recorded at the original amounts paid for common and convertible preferred stock, and subsequently adjusted for the AMA's share of undistributed earnings and losses from the underlying entities from the dates of formation. Each investment will be increased or reduced by any future additional contributions and distributions received, respectively. The cost method of accounting is used to account for investments in companies in which the AMA has neither significant influence nor overall control and where the fair value is not readily determinable. The companies accounted for under the equity method of accounting during 2022 are: HXSquare, Inc. (formed in January 2019 and liquidated in February 2022), Emergence Healthcare Group, Inc. (formed in January 2021), Heal Security, Inc. (formed in February 2021), and Recovery Exploration Technologies, Inc. (formed in August 2021). During 2022, the AMA ceased application of the equity method to account for the investment in Recovery Exploration Technologies, Inc. as additional third-party investment resulted in AMA no longer exercising significant influence over this entity. At December 31, 2022, AMA ownership interest is 20.1% in Emergence Healthcare Group, Inc. and 33.3% in Heal Security, Inc. The book value of the two investments accounted for under the equity method, net of convertible debt, at December 31, 2022 is $1.8 million. In addition, at December 31, 2022, AMA has an ownership interest of 3.6% in Zing Health Enterprises, LP (formed in May 2020), 12.1% in Medcurio Inc., (formed in February 2020), 12.6% in Phenomix Sciences, Inc. (formed in August 2020), 11.3% in Recovery Exploration Technologies, Inc., 18.8% in Sitebridge Research, Inc. (formed January 2021), and 6.0% in Scholar Rx, Inc. (formed December 2022). The investments in these entities are accounted for using the cost method, as AMA holds less than a 20% ownership and does not exercise significant influence over the entities. The book value of the six investments carried at cost at December 31, 2022 is $7.1 million.Inventories Inventories, consisting primarily of books and paper for publications, are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Property and equipment Property and equipment are carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Equipment and software are depreciated or amortized over three to 10 years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful lives or the remaining lease term. Revenue recognition Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that AMA expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. AMA enters into contracts that generally include only one product or service and as such, are distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. Nature of products and services Membership dues are deferred and recognized as revenue in equal monthly amounts during the applicable membership year, which is a calendar year. Dues from lifetime memberships are recognized as revenue over the approximate life of the member. Licensing and subscriptions to scientific journals, site licenses, newsletters or other online products are recognized as revenue ratably over the terms of the subscriptions or service period. Advertising revenue and direct publication costs are recognized in the period the related journal is issued. Book and product sales are recognized at the time the book or product is shipped or otherwise delivered to the customer. Royalties are recognized as revenue over the royalty term. Insurance brokerage commissions on individual policies are recognized as revenue on the date they become effective or are renewed, to the extent services under the policies are complete. Brokerage commissions or plan rebates on the group products are recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the contract as services are rendered.Health2047 had investments in ten companies or limited partnerships as of December 31, 2021, including two that were consolidated, First Mile Care, Inc. and Akiri, Inc. The companies accounted for under the equity method of accounting during 2021 were: HXSquare, Inc., Phenomix Sciences, Inc., Emergence Healthcare Group, Inc., Heal Security, Inc., and Recovery Exploration Technologies, Inc. During 2021, the AMA ceased application of the equity method to account for the investment in Phenomix Sciences, Inc. as additional third-party investment resulted in AMA no longer exercising significant influence over this entity. At December 31, 2021 AMA ownership interest was 20% in HXSquare, Inc., 21.9% in Emergence Healthcare Group, Inc., 33.3% in Heal Security, Inc. and 22.6% in Recovery Exploration Technologies, Inc. The book value of the four investments accounted for under the equity method, net of convertible debt, at December 31, 2021 was $2.4 million. In addition, at December 31, 2021, AMA had an ownership interest of 5.5% in Zing Health Enterprises, LP , 11.8% in Medcurio 14.4% in Phenomix Sciences, Inc. and 18.8% in Sitebridge Research, Inc. The investments in these entities were accounted for using the cost method, as AMA held less than a 20% ownership and did not exercise significant influence over the entities. The book value of the four investments carried at cost at December 31, 2021 was $4.6 million. Use of estimates Preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted (GAAP) in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as reflected in the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from estimates. Cash equivalents Cash equivalents consist of liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. Fiduciary funds One of the AMA's subsidiaries, the AMA Insurance Agency, Inc., in its capacity as an insurance broker, collects premiums from the insured and, after deducting its commission, remits the premiums to the underwriter of the insurance coverage. Unremitted insurance premiums are invested on a short-term basis and are held in a fiduciary capacity. The AMA also collects and holds contributions on behalf of separate unincorporated entities with $2.3 million and $2.8 million held at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 30 | 2022 AMA Annual Report Contract balances AMA records a receivable when the performance obligation is satisfied and revenue is recognized. For agreements covering subscription or service periods, AMA generally records a receivable related to revenue recognized for the subscription, license or royalty period. For sales of books and products, AMA records a receivable at the time the product is shipped or otherwise delivered to the customer. These amounts are included in accounts receivable on the consolidated statements of financial position and the balance, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $96.3 million and $85.1 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects AMA's best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. The allowance is based on historical experience and other currently available evidence. Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. Some annual licensing agreements carry longer payment terms. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, AMA has determined that these contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. Prepaid dues are included as deferred membership dues revenue in the consolidated statements of financial position. Prepayments by customers in advance of the subscription, royalty or insurance coverage period are recorded as deferred subscriptions, licensing, insurance commissions and royalty revenue in the consolidated statements of financial position. Income taxes The AMA is an exempt organization as defined by Section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code and is subject to income taxes only on income determined to be unrelated business taxable income. The AMA's subsidiaries are taxable entities and are subject to income taxes.3. New accounting standards update In August 2020, Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2020-06, Debt\u2014 Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging \u2014 Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) \u2014 Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity . The amendments in this update are expected to improve, simplify, and enhance the financial reporting requirements for convertible instruments and contracts in an entity's own equity for all entities, including private companies. The new guidance is effective for the AMA for the year ending December 31, 2024. AMA does not expect there to be a material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption. 4. Investments Investments include marketable securities, venture capital and private equity investments that are carried at fair value. In determining fair value, the AMA uses various valuation approaches. The FASB's Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset based on market data obtained from sources independent of the organization. Unobservable inputs are inputs that would reflect an organization's assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the observability of inputs as follows: Level 1\u2014Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets that the organization has the ability to access. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment. Level 2\u2014Valuations based on one or more quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. Level 3\u2014Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. 2022 AMA Annual Report | 31Investments also include investments in a diversified closed end private equity fund with a focus on buyout and secondary market opportunities in the United States and the European Union, as well as investments in a venture capital fund focused on companies developing promising health care technologies that can be commercialized into revolutionary products and services that improve the practice of medicine and the delivery and management of health care. The investments are not redeemable and distributions are received through liquidation of the underlying assets of the funds. It is estimated that the underlying assets will be liquidated over the next four to ten years. The fair value estimates of these investments are based on NAV as provided by the investment manager. Unfunded commitments as of December 31, 2022, and 2021 totaled $80.1 million and $76.4 million, respectively. The AMA manages its investments in accordance with Board- approved investment policies that establish investment objectives of real inflation-adjusted growth over the investment time horizon, with diversification to provide a balance between long-term growth objectives and potential liquidity needs. The following table presents information about the AMA's investments measured at fair value as of December 31. In accordance with ASC Subtopic 820-10, investments that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the consolidated statements of financial position. 2022 2021 Level 1 - Quoted prices in active market for identical securities Equity securities $ 419.9 $ 474.6 Fixed-income mutual funds 27.1 48.9 4 47.0 523.5 Level 2 -Significant other observable inputs Debt securities Corporate 106.7 116.0 U.S. government and federal agency 264.8 269.1 Foreign government 24.7 28.7 U.S. state government 0.1 0.2 396.3 414.0 Other investments measured at NAV - Private equity and venture capital funds 89.9 69.1 Investments $ 933.2 $ 1,006.6The availability of observable inputs can vary from instrument to instrument and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the liquidity of markets and other characteristics particular to the transaction. To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. The AMA uses prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date, obtained through a third-party custodian from independent pricing services. A description of the valuation techniques applied to the major categories of investments measured at fair value is outlined below. Exchange-traded equity securities are valued based on quoted prices from the exchange. To the extent these securities are actively traded, valuation adjustments are not applied and they are categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Mutual funds are open-ended Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) registered investment funds with a daily net asset value (NAV). The mutual funds allow investors to sell their interests to the fund at the published daily NAV, with no restrictions on redemptions. These mutual funds are categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of corporate debt securities is estimated using recently executed transactions, market price quotations (where observable) or bond spreads. If the spread data does not reference the issuer, then data that reference a comparable issuer are used. Corporate debt securities are generally categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. U.S. government agency securities consist of two categories of agency issued debt. Non-callable agency issued debt securities are generally valued using dealer quotes. Callable agency issued debt securities are valued by benchmarking model-derived prices to quoted market prices and trade data for identical or comparable securities. Agency issued debt securities are categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. U.S. government securities are valued using quoted prices provided by a vendor or broker-dealer. These securities are categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, as it is difficult for the custodian to accurately assess at a security level whether a quoted trade on a bond represents an active market. Foreign and U.S. state government securities are valued using quoted prices in active markets when available. To the extent quoted prices are not available, fair value is determined based on interest rate yield curves, cross-currency basis index spreads, and country credit spreads for structures similar to the bond in terms of issuer, maturity and seniority. These investments are generally categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 32 | 2022 AMA Annual Report Interest and dividends are included in investment income as operating revenue while realized and unrealized gains and losses are included as a component of non-operating items. Investment income consists of: 2022 2021 Investment dividend and interest income $ 18.3 $ 15.1 Management fees (3.2) (3.5) $ 15.1 $ 11.6 Investment non-operating items include: 2022 2021 Realized gains on investments, net $ 6.4 $ 74.8 Unrealized (losses) gains on investments, net (121.5) 8.0 $ (115.1) $ 82.8 5. Other assets Other assets include investments in mutual funds maintained in separate accounts designated for various nonqualified benefit plans that are not available for operations. Mutual funds are open-ended SEC registered investment funds with a daily NAV. The mutual funds allow investors to sell their interests to the fund at the published daily NAV, with no restrictions on redemptions. These mutual funds are categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The investments totaled $8.2 million and $9.4 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 6. Property and equipment Property and equipment at December 31 consists of: 2022 2021 Leasehold improvements $ 39.0 $ 38.7 Furniture and office equipment 19.9 19.7 Information technology Hardware 12.9 13.5 Software 94.4 97.6 166.2 169.5 Accumulated depreciation and amortization (132.9) (129.9) Property and equipment, net $ 33.3 $ 39.67. Retirement savings plans The AMA has a 401(k) retirement and savings plan, which allows eligible employees to contribute up to 75 percent of their compensation annually, subject to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) limits. The AMA matches 100 percent of the first three percent and 50 percent of the next two percent of employee contributions. The AMA may, at its discretion, make additional contributions for any year in an amount up to two percent of the compensation for each eligible employee. Compensation is subject to IRS limits and excludes bonuses and severance pay. AMA matching and discretionary contribution expense totaled $8.3 million and $7.9 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. 8. Postretirement health care benefits The AMA provides health care benefits to retired employees who were employed on or prior to December 31, 2010. After that date, no individual can become a participant in the plan. Generally, qualified employees become eligible for these benefits if they retire in accordance with the plan provisions and are participating in the AMA medical plan at the time of their retirement. The AMA shares the cost of the retiree health care payments with retirees, paying approximately 60 to 80 percent of the expected benefit payments. The AMA has the right to modify or terminate the postretirement benefit plan at any time. Other employers participate in this plan and liabilities are allocated between the AMA and the other employers. The AMA has applied for and received the federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provides a prescription drug benefit that is actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 . In accordance with ASC Topic 958-715, Compensation-Retirement Benefits , the AMA initially accounted for the subsidy as an actuarial experience gain to the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. The postretirement health care plan is unfunded. In accordance with ASC Topic 958-715, the AMA recognizes this liability in its consolidated statements of financial position. 2022 AMA Annual Report | 33Postretirement health care-related changes, other than periodic expense, that have been included as a charge or credit to unrestricted equity consist of: 2022 2021 Actuarial gains arising during period $ 30.9 $ 4.8 Reclassification adjustment for recognition of actuarial loss 0.4 1.4 Reclassification adjustment for recognition of prior service credit - (0.3) Change in unrestricted equity $ 31.3 $ 5.9 Actuarial assumptions used in determining postretirement health care expense are the same assumptions noted in the table above for determining the accumulated benefit obligation, except as follows: 2022 2021 Discount rate 2.8% 2.5% Initial health care cost trend 6.1% 5.64% The following postretirement health care benefit payments are expected to be paid by the AMA, net of contributions by retirees and federal subsidies: 2023 $ 3.6 2024 3.7 2025 4.1 2026 4.3 2027 4.6 2028 -2032 26.0 9. Income taxes The provision for income taxes includes: 2022 2021 Operating Current $ 4.3 $ 3.7 Deferred (21.4) 0.1 Valuation allowance 21.5 (0.2) 4.4 3.6 Tax expense related to credits or charges to equity Deferred 1.9 0.3 $ 6.3 $ 3.9The following reconciles the change in accumulated benefit obligation and the amounts included in the consolidated statements of financial position at December 31: 2022 2021 Benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 117. 5 $ 120.5 Service cost 1.1 1.5 Interest cost 3.1 2.8 Benefits paid (4.1) (3.8) Participant contributions 1.2 1.2 Federal subsidy 0.2 0.2 Actuarial gain (30.9) (4.9) Accrued postretirement benefit costs $ 88.1 $ 117. 5 The postretirement health care plan accumulated losses not yet recognized as a component of periodic postretirement health care expense, but included as an accumulated charge or credit to equity as of December 31 are: 2022 2021 Actuarial (gains) losses $ (9.7) $ 21.6 Actuarial assumptions used in determining the accumulated benefit obligation at December 31 are: 2022 2021 Discount rate 5.2% 2.8% Initial health care cost trend 7.0 % 6.1% Ultimate health care cost trend 4.0% 4.0% Year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate 2046 2045 AMA recognizes postretirement health care expense in its consolidated statements of activities. The service cost component is included as part of compensation and benefits expense and the other components of expense are recognized as a non-operating item: 2022 2021 Service cost $ 1.1 $ 1.4 Interest cost 3.1 2.8 Amortization of prior service credit - (0.3) Amortization of actuarial loss 0.4 1.4 $ 4.6 $ 5.3 34 | 2022 AMA Annual Report As prescribed under ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes , the AMA determines its provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. The deferred tax benefit or charge from credits or charges to equity represents the estimated tax benefit from recording unrecognized actuarial losses and prior service credits for the postretirement health care plan, pursuant to ASC Topic 958-715. Valuation allowances are provided to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The AMA evaluates the likelihood of realizing its deferred tax assets by estimating sources of future taxable income and assessing whether or not it is likely that future taxable income will be adequate for the AMA to realize the deferred tax asset. The AMA established an initial valuation allowance in 2009 to reflect the fact that deferred tax assets include future expected benefits, largely related to retiree health care payments, that may not be deductible due to a projected lack of taxable advertising income in future years. Increases or decreases in deferred tax assets, where future benefits are considered unlikely, will result in an equal and offsetting change in the valuation reserve. If the AMA were to make a determination in future years that these deferred tax assets would be realized, the related valuation allowance would be reduced and a benefit to earnings recorded. Deferred tax assets recognized in the consolidated statements of financial position at December 31 are: 2022 2021 Net operating loss carryforward $ 21.4 $ - Benefit plans and compensation 5.2 7. 3 Other 0.1 (0.1) 26.7 7. 2 Valuation allowance (24.0) (2.5) $ 2.7 $ 4.7 Cash payments for income taxes were $4 million and $6.2 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, net of refunds.10. Leases AMA leases office space at a number of locations and the initial terms of the office leases range from five years to 15 years. Most leases have options to renew at then prevailing market rates, or, in one circumstance, early terminate with appropriate notice and termination payments. As any extension, renewal, or termination is at the sole discretion of AMA, and at this date is not certain, renewal and termination options are not included in the right-of-use (ROU) asset or lease liability. AMA leases do not provide an implicit interest rate and as such, AMA calculates the lease liability at lease commencement or remeasurement date as the present value of unpaid lease payments using an estimated incremental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing rate represents the rate of interest that AMA estimates it would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term, based on information available at the time of commencement or remeasurement. AMA exercised a contraction option during 2022 reducing the square footage at the main headquarters by approximately 10%, with a contraction penalty. The ROU asset and lease liability were remeasured as of the lease modification date and the impact of the contraction is reflected in the ROU asset and lease liability as of December 31, 2022. ROU assets decreased $1.3 million, lease liabilities decreased $2.3 million, with the resulting net gain of $1 million included as a reduction to other operating expense. AMA also leases copiers and printers in several locations. The lease agreements do not contain variable lease payments, residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. All office and equipment leases are classified as operating leases. Operating lease costs totaled $9.7 million in 2022 and $10.1 million in 2021. Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities totaled $13.2 million in 2022 and $13.1 million in 2021. The remaining weighted-average lease term is 6.3 years and 7.1 years as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The weighted-average discount rate used for operating leases is 5% for both 2022 and 2021. The maturity of lease liabilities as of December 31, 2022: 2023 $ 15.3 2024 11.4 2025 11.4 2026 11.6 2027 11.8 2028 and beyond 14.5 Total lease payments 76.0 Less imputed interest (10.7) Present value of lease obligations $ 65.3 2022 AMA Annual Report | 35 2022 2021 Financial assets $ 966.7 $ 1,038.7 Less assets unavailable for general expenditures: Restricted by governing body primarily for long-term investing or for governing body approved outlays (841.4) (8 87.6) Financial assets available to meet cash needs for general expenditures within one year $ 125.3 $ 151.1 In addition to financial assets available to meet general expenditures over the next 12 months, the AMA operates under a policy that requires an annual budget surplus, excluding time- or dollar-limited strategic expenditures approved by the board, and anticipates generating sufficient revenue to cover general ongoing expenditures on an annual basis. 12. Contingencies In the opinion of management, there are no pending legal actions for which the ultimate liability will have a material effect on the equity of the AMA. 13. Subsequent events ASC Topic 855, Subsequent Events, establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the consolidated balance sheet date but before consolidated financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the AMA has evaluated all subsequent events through February 10, 2023, which is the date the consolidated financial statements were available to be issued, and concluded no additional subsequent events have occurred that would require recognition or disclosure in these consolidated financial statements that have not already been accounted for.11. Financial asset availability and liquidity AMA has a formal reserve policy that defines the reserve investment portfolios as pools of liquid net assets that can be accessed to mitigate the impact of undesirable financial events or to pursue opportunities of strategic importance that may arise, as well as provide a source of capital appreciation. The policy establishes minimum required dollar levels required to be held in the portfolios (defined as an amount equal to one-year's general and administrative operating expenses plus long-term liabilities). The policy also covers the use of dividend and interest income, establishes criteria for use of the funds and outlines the handling of excess operating funds on an annual basis. Dividend and interest income generated from the reserve portfolios are transferred to operating funds monthly and used to fund operations. The formal reserve policy contemplates use of reserve portfolio funds for board approved time- or dollar- limited strategic outlays, to the extent that the reserve portfolio balances exceed the minimum amount established by policy. All surplus funds generated from operations annually (defined as operating cash plus other current assets minus current liabilities and deferred revenue at year end) are transferred to the reserve portfolios after year-end. The reserve policy does not cover the for-profit subsidiaries' activities. AMA invests cash in excess of projected weekly requirements in short-term investments and money market funds. AMA does not maintain any credit facilities as the reserve portfolios provide ample protection against any liquidity needs. The following reflects AMA's financial assets as of December 31 reduced by amounts not available for general use that have been set aside for long-term investing in the reserve investment portfolios or funds subject to donor restrictions. AMA's financial assets include cash, cash equivalents and donor restricted cash, short-term investments and long-term investments in the reserve portfolios. 36 | 2022 AMA Annual Report 14.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements. In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, we: Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the AMA's internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements. Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the AMA's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related matters that we identified during the audit. Deloitte & Touche LLP Chicago, Illinois February 10, 2023The Board of Trustees of American Medical Association Opinion We have audited the consolidated financial statements of the American Medical Association (the \"AMA\") and subsidiaries, which comprise the consolidated statements of financial position as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of activities and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the AMA as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the AMA and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audits. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the AMA's ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued.Independent auditor's report 38 | 2022 AMA Annual Report Written statement of certification of chief executive officer and chief financial officer The undersigned hereby certify that the information contained in the consolidated financial statements of the American Medical Association for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 fairly present, in all material respects, the financial condition and the results of operations of the American Medical Association.

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES B of T Report 13-A-23 Subject: Delegate Apportionment and Pending Members Presented by: Sandra Adamson Fryhofer , MD, Chair Referred to: Reference Committee F At the November 2022 Interim Meeting, Board of Trustees Report 3, \"Delegate Apportionment and 1 Pending Members ,\" was considered and referred . 2 3 BACKGROUND 4 5 At the 2018 Interim Meeting, policy was adopted calling for the inclusion of pending members in 6 the delegate apportionment process. Per Board of Trustees Report 1 -I-18 pending members are 7 those who at the time they apply for AMA membership are not members and who pay dues for the 8 following calendar year. This typically occurs in the last few weeks of one year, with the 9 individual's membership becoming active on January 1 of the following year. The policy was 10 refined in Board of Trustees Report 12- A-19 to address issues related to counting such members as 11 well as distinctions between constituent and specialty societies, and the necessary bylaws 12 amendments were adopted at the 2019 Interim Meeting in the Council on Constitution and Bylaws 13 Report 3- I-19. This formed AMA Policy G -600.016, \"Data Us ed to Apportion Delegates,\" which 14 also called for an evaluation at A -22. Board of Trustees Report 20- A-22 provided a review on the 15 effects of counting pending members and included six recommendations. One recommendation 16 was adopted which defined the apport ionment process for 2023 and was predicated on not counting 17 pending members. (Policy G -600.959 paragraph 1). Recommendation 1 of BOT Report 20- A-22 18 was referred for decision and the remaining recommendations were referred. 19 20 In September 2022, your Board v oted to adopt Recommendation 1 of Board Report 20- A-22, 21 which had been referred for decision. By this action pending members would not be counted for 22 apportionment purposes, which was subsequently recorded as paragraph 2 of Policy G -600.959, 23 \"Delegate Appo rtionment and Pending Members.\" 24 25 Board of Trustees Report 3 -I-22 dealt with the remaining referred items from Board Report 20- A- 26 22. The report included a recommendation to rescind Policy G -600.016. The House of Delegates 27 (HOD) referred the report back to t he Board. Also at I -22, the HOD considered Constitution & 28 Bylaws Report 1 -I-22 which recommended changes to Bylaw \u00a72.1.1.1 specifying how 29 apportionment would be accomplished for 2023 and recommended deletion of the following 30 sentence , \"The December 31 count will include pending members for purposes of apportionment; 31 however, pending members shall not be recounted the following year abse nt membership 32 renewal.\" The HOD adopted the bylaw amendment specifying the 2023 apportionment but referred 33 the recommended deletion of the sentence reproduced above. Given the Board's September action, 34 to no longer count pending members and the adopted byl aw which specifies the process to be used 35 for 2023, the referred sentence although retained in Bylaw \u00a72.1.1.1 has no impact . Furthermore, the 36 amendment adopted by the House includes a sunset provision for the entirety of Bylaw \u00a72.1.1.1 as 37 of December 31, 2023. 38 B of T Rep. 13 -A-23 -- page 2 of 4 DISCUSSION 1 2 The original policy adopted by the HOD regarding pending members called for a subsequent 3 evaluation of the policy with recommendations regarding its continuation. This evaluation showed 4 that the intended goals of counting pending members for apportionment of HOD Delegates had not 5 been realized. In addition, your Board believes that counting pending members diminishes the role 6 of active members themselves, devalues other benefits of membership and unnecessarily 7 complicates the apportionment process. 8 9 There is little to no evidence that suggests that the offer to count pending members for 10 apportionment purposes has led to membership gains. Virtually all the pending members identified 11 in the initial adoption of the policy had already joined prior to the implementation of the 12 experiment. Anecdotes suggesting that being counted toward representation in the House of 13 Delegates is a motivation for members to join late in the membership cycle has not been confirmed 14 with data over the trial years. Phys icians consistently report valuing the advocacy that emerges 15 from House of Delegates (HOD) policy, not representation in the House of Delegates itself per se. 16 17 There may be isolated instances where state delegations at risk for losing a seat in the House may 18 be motivated to recruit pending members, but it would seem these efforts should be undertaken 19 earlier in the membership year to recruit members for the actual year used for apportionment not 20 the following year. In fact, our current bylaws (2.1.1.2.1) provide that if the membership 21 information as recorded at the end of a year warrants a decrease in the number of delegates, the 22 association is permitted to retain their delegate number, without decrease, for an additional year to 23 intensify their recruitment of members. Counting pending members, those who pay dues not for 24 that additional grace year but for the following year, in effect extends the grace period and creates 25 an opportunity for members to join every third year while still being counted for apportionment. 26 27 The notion that pending members gain representation by being counted for apportionment purposes 28 belies the fact that delegates represent the needs of not only members but patients, their sponsoring 29 societies, and the profession, including nonmembers. This is explicitly stated in the HOD 30 Reference Manual . Pending members are in fact NOT members. Individuals who join late in the 31 year wishing to be represented in the HOD could join for the current year by paying half-year dues. 32 It has been said that counting pending members more fairly apportions delegation count. On the 33 contrary, since representation in HOD is based upon membership numbers, allowing certain 34 societies to inflate their delegate numbers beyond their true proportional representation by 35 including pending members diminishes the vote of other societies that have fulfilled their 36 membership requirements and may be thought to disenfranchise the current members. 37 38 Some delegations hoped that including pending members would increase their number of delegates. 39 Upon implementation virtually all the increase came in the first year of the experiment and few 40 states ac tually gained delegates even in that initial year. Any increase was short lived as pending 41 members provide a net membership increase only in their initial count. Ultimately, there is no 42 evidence that pending members have any positive effect on apportionment numbers . 43 44 Others have argued that not counting pending members is tantamount to treating them as second- 45 class members. As noted above, they are indeed not members, at least not initially, and once they 46 are members they will be counted just like all other members in the year in which their membership 47 dues apply. Decisions about apportionment need not be linked to more concrete member benefits. 48 In fact, members do begin receiving most membership benefits shortly after the membership 49 decision is made. 50 B of T Rep. 13 -A-23 -- page 3 of 4 Although physicians and medical students make the membership decision throughout the year, 1 AMA membership, similar to most every other medical society membership, is calendar year 2 based. For example, medical students, particularly first year students, ofte n join in July or August 3 and most continuing members renew their membership for the following year in November and 4 December. As such, the membership count varies from day to day. Determination of membership 5 count and thus apportionment could theoretically be done on any date but has to be completed on a 6 defined date. The date of December 31 is specified in multiple provisions within our bylaws. The 7 AMA recognizes dues revenue in financial statements for the calendar membership year. Legally, 8 members are lis ted as members for the calendar year membership designated on the membership 9 application, regardless when submitted and paid. 10 11 Finally, a s a practical matter , once someone becomes a pending member, the individual must be 12 tracked across time in perpetuity solely for apportionment lest membership become an on -again, 13 off-again process to game the system. The timing of one's dues payment and one's membership 14 status at the time of that payment affect how and whether one is counted for apportionment 15 purposes. These elements cannot be captured by AMA's membership accounting system across a 16 potential 40 - or 50- year career in medicine. To track the information would require an estimated 17 quarter million dollar change to the membership accounting system. 18 19 CONCLUSION 20 21 While the composition of the House is the province of the HOD, your Board maintains that the 22 long- standing policy of counting actual members for apportionment, including a one -year grace 23 period for societies at risk of losing a delegate seat, has served our association, the House, and 24 members well. There is no clear evidence that counting pending members increases membership or 25 provides benefit to constituent societies. Counting pending members can be considered to diminish 26 or discount actual mem bers' value as much as it can be seen to enhance representation. In addition, 27 it unnecessarily complicates the apportionment process and adds additional cost of tracking 28 pending members over time. Your Board concludes that the trial of counting pending mem bers for 29 apportionment purposes should not be continued. 30 31 The adoption of the Policy G -600.959 [1] and the bylaw amendment from CC&B Report 1- I-22 32 specified the process that was followed for apportionment for 2023. The amended Bylaw 33 \u00a72.1.1.1includes a suns et provision for the entirety of the bylaw as of December 31, 2023. Given 34 that the apportionment process for 2023 is complete, Policy G -600.959 [1] should be rescinded as it 35 has been accomplished. 36 37 RECOMMENDATION 38 39 Therefore, your Board of Trustees recommends that paragraphs 2- 4 of Policy G -600.016 and 40 paragraph 1 of Policy G -600.959 be rescinded and the remainder of the report filed. 41 Fiscal Note: $ 150 to update PolicyFinder B of T Rep. 13 -A-23 -- page 4 of 4 RELEVANT AMA POLICY Data Used to Apportion Delegates G -600.016 1. Our AMA shall issue an annual, mid- year report on or around June 30 to inform each state medical society and each national medical specialty society that is in the process of its 5 -year review of its current AMA membership count. 2. \"Pending members\" (defined as individuals who at the time they apply for membership are not current in their dues and who pay dues for the following calendar year) will be added to the number of active AMA members in the December 31 count for the purposes of AMA delegate allocations to state medical societies for the following year and this total will be used to determine the number of national medical specialty delegates to maintain parity. 3. Our AMA will track \"pending members\" from a given year who are counted towards delegate allocation for the following year and these members will not be counted again for delegate allocation unless they renew their membership before the end of the following year. 4. Our AMA Board of Trustees will issue a report to the House of Delegates at the 2 022 Annual Meeting on the impact of Policy G -600.016 and recommendations regarding continuation of this policy. Delegate Apportionment and Pending Members G -600.959 1. Delegates will be apportioned to constituent societies for 2023 with each society getti ng the greatest of the following numbers: - The number of delegates apportioned at the rate of 1 per 1000, or fraction thereof, AMA members; - The number of delegates apportioned for 2022 so long as that figure is not greater than 2 more than the number apportioned at the rate of 1 per 1000, or fraction thereof, AMA members; or - For societies that would lose more than five delegates from their 2022 apportionment, the number of delegates, apportioned at the rate of 1 per 1000, or fraction thereof, AMA membe rs, plus 5. 2. Pending members will no longer be counted for delegate apportionment. BOT Rep. 20, A -22; BOT Action in response to referred for decision: BOT Rep. 20, A -22 \u00a9 2023 American Medical Association.

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES B of T Report 18 -A-23 Subject: Making AMA Meetings Accessible Presented by: Sandra Adamson Fryhofer, MD, Chair Referred to: Reference Committee F Policy G-630.140 [8] , adopted by the American Medical Association House of Delegates (HOD) at 1 the 2022 Annual Meeting, called for a report to the HOD by no later than the 2023 Annual Meeting 2 with a plan on how to maximize meeting participation for members and invited attendees with 3 disabilities. This report responds to G -630.140 [8]. 4 5 BACKGROUND 6 7 AMA meeting venues are selected several years in advance to secure locations and begin meeting 8 planning. Among the other considerations, management is directed by current AMA policy to 9 choose hotels for its meetings, conferences, and conventions based on size, service, location, cost, 10 and simi lar factors. For our Interim and Annual M eetings, efforts are made to locate the Section 11 Assembly Meetings in the House of Delegates m eeting hotel or in a hotel in proximity. 12 13 When planning an event, it is important to consider accessibility for individua ls with disabilities, 14 and AMA management takes this responsibility seriously by researching venues and assessing their 15 accessibility features, considering unique needs, and providing necessary aids for optimal 16 participation. 17 18 To ensure accessibility for individuals with disabilities, AMA management follow s a thorough 19 process. This includes researching venues that have necessary accessibility features and conducting 20 in-person site visits to assess various features such as parking, entrances, elevators, ramps, 21 restrooms, all gender restrooms, seating arrangements, and audiovisual capabilities. Additionally, 22 AMA management consider s unique needs such as sensory processing issues and provides options 23 for individuals to retreat to quiet spaces as needed. To further enhance participation, AMA 24 management offer s various audio and visual aids to accommodate those who are sight or hearing 25 impaired. For individuals with hearing impairments, options include sign language interpreters, 26 assistive listen ing devices, and captioning. For individuals with visual impairments, options include 27 audio descriptions, tactile maps and models, Braille and large -print materials, and accessible 28 technology such as screen readers or magnification software. 29 30 For the heari ng assistance device, management will work to ensure that the device is available and 31 working properly during management meetings. Members who require this device can inform 32 management in advance, and staff will make sure that the device is set up and read y for use. This 33 information will be included in the registration form for the meeting, or members can contact 34 management directly to request the device. 35 36 B of T Rep. 18-A-23 -- page 2 of 3 For an in- person interpreter, management will work to ensure that a qualified interpreter is 1 available for members who require this service. The cost of the interpreter will be covered by the 2 AMA, not by the member. Meeting services will coordinate with the interpreter and the member to 3 ensure that the interpreter is available at the appropriate time and location. Members who require 4 an interpreter can inform management in advance, and staff will make sure that an interpreter is 5 available. 6 7 For members in wheelchairs, management will work to ensure that the meeting venue is accessible 8 and that accommodations are made as needed. This may include providing accessible seating, 9 ensuring that there are accessible paths of travel throughout the venue, and making sure that any 10 equipment or materials needed by the member are available and accessible. Me mbers who require 11 accommodations for mobility issues can inform management in advance, and staff will work with 12 the member to ensure that their needs are met. 13 14 Overall, management is committed to ensuring that all members are able to participate fully in 15 meetings and that their needs are accommodated appropriately. Members who require special 16 accommodations should inform management in advance, and staff will work to ensure that these 17 accommodations are made. 18 19 Further , the House of Delegates (HOD) Affairs Office provides an opportunity for delegates and 20 alternate delegates to request special accommodations thru the delegate credentialing process. Any 21 requests are handled by the Director, HOD Affairs, in conjunction wit h meeting services. The HOD 22 Office has been made aware of three instances where accommodations were needed. In those 23 instances, the attendees provided their own accommodations and informed the HOD Office for 24 awareness purposes. 25 B of T Rep. 18-A-23 -- page 3 of 3 CONCLUSION 1 2 Ensuring accessibility for all attendees, including those with disabilities, is an important aspect of 3 event planning and management. Providing accommodations such as assistive technologies and 4 sign language interpreters can help ensure that all attendees have an equal o pportunity to 5 participate fully in the conference and benefit from its content. It is also important to ensure that 6 the accommodations are communicated clearly to attendees, so they know how to request them if 7 needed. By taking these steps, the conference organizers are demonstrating their commitment to 8 inclusion and creating a welcoming environment for all attendees. 9 10 AMA management considers that all the venues for the conference have taken steps to ensure that 11 they are compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements. This means that 12 attendees with disabilities will have access to all areas of the venue, including entrances, restrooms, 13 and meeting rooms. 14 15 RECOMMENDATION 16 17 The Board of Trustees recommends that Policy G -630.140 [8] be rescinded as being accomplished 18 by this report, and the remainder of the report be filed. 19 Fiscal Note: No significant fiscal impact \u00a9 2023 American Medical Association.

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES B of T Report 2 0-A-23 Subject: Surveillance Management System for Organized Medicine Policies and Reports (Resolution 609-A-22) Presented by: Sandra Adamson Fryhofer, MD, Chair Referred to: Reference Committee F Resolution 609 A -22 \"Surveillance Management System for Organized Medicine Policies and 1 Reports ,\" sponsored by Georgia Delegation , was referred to the Board of Trustees. Resolution 609 2 A-22 asked: 3 4 1. That our American Medical Associ ation develop a prioritization matrix across both global 5 and reference committee specific areas of interest (Directive to Take Action); 6 2. That our AMA develop a web- based surveillance management system, with pre -defined 7 primary and/or secondary metrics, for resolutions and reports passed by their respective 8 governance body (Directive to Take Action); 9 3. That our AMA share previously approved metrics and results from the surveillance 10 management system at intervals deemed most appropriate to the state and local 11 membership of organized medicine, including where and when appropriate to their 12 patients. (Direct ive to Take Action) 13 14 BACKGROUND 15 16 Resolution 609 describes a need to have appropriate surveillance and dissemination system(s) in 17 place that addresses the informational needs of physicians at the state and local levels including 18 those who are members of House of Delegates within organized medicine. Further, the resolution 19 asks that a prioritization matrix b e created to aid delegates ' and Federation soci eties' decision- 20 making in submission of relevant and timely resolutions. 21 22 The role of prioritization matrices 23 24 Decision -making and prioritization frameworks are in common use across industries. Prioritization 25 can be determined by any number of factors, but typical examples may include: 26 Importance 27 Urgency 28 Relevancy 29 Probability of Success ful Outcome 30 Risk 31 32 Matrices are used when executive decision -making is required to move forward. Typically, scoring 33 values (e.g. Rank- Order, Likert Scales) must be captured in a consistent manner. Furthermore, the 34 relative weighting of each factor is another important design element that must be determined. 35 36 B of T Rep. 2 0-A-23 -- page 2 of 4 1 Current resources within AMA 2 3 By nature of our AMA's councils, sections, and delegates structures, resolutions are shaped 4 through a rigorous process of research, proposal, discussion, review and ultimately debate and 5 voting. 6 7 Members of our House of Delegates today have access to a detailed House of Delegates microsite 8 within ama -assn.org. The site provides a prelim inary agenda that incorporates a \"Bookmark\" 9 feature to allow delegates to be notified of changes over time. 10 11 There are three primary database tools available to the public: 12 13 14 15 AMA's PolicyFinder resource allows delegates and other interested parties to search prior AMA 16 policies with free text and Boolean keyword search. Information f rom this search includes Topic, 17 Meeting Type, Action, Council & Committees, Year Last Modified, and Type. In addition to a 18 description of the policy, there is a timeline that shows the trajectory of that policy, including 19 relevant hyperlinks to council rep orts where possible (see Figure). 20 21 AMA's Council Report F inder contains 347 artifacts as of February 2023. Users may search based 22 on keywords and filter by meeting date and by Councils and Committees among others. 23 24 AMA Archives contains digests of official actions, historical monographs, HoD proceedings, and 25 Transactions (records of day -to-day activities) . As of this writing, the database houses materials 26 from 1847 to 2019. 27 28 29 30 PolicyFinderCouncil Reports FinderAMA Archives B of T Rep. 2 0-A-23 -- page 3 of 4 1 In addition to keyword searches, users can enable a variety of filters and flags to explore AMA 2 policy. The screenshot below highlights some of these options: 3 4 5 6 Prior organizational investments in House of Delegates usability 7 8 Our AMA maintains a website repository of proceedings , accessible to the public, from prior 9 House of Delegates meetings, covering the prior decade . Visitors to this site can determine the 10 implementation status of reports and resolutions. Materials are available in PDF format and 11 searchable. Meetings dating prior to 2012 are located on AMA's archive database , also available to 12 members, the research community, and public. 13 14 15 In late 2022, AMA's Strategic Insights team was asked to lead a user experience study on our 16 PolicyFinder. Study subjects specifically incorporated member s of our HOD, Council, and 17 Reference Committee staff. The goals of the study were to better understand: 18 The extent to which the design and functionality of PolicyFinder align with the needs and 19 expectations of target user s (with particular attention to the search functionality) 20 Usability issues that may impac t the user experience and highlight opportunities for further 21 enhancement 22 23 This project is concluding at the time of this writing. The conclusions will be used to inform the 24 product development roadmap for PolicyFinder. 25 26 Significant financial and logistical challenges exist to maintain a prioritization matrix tool for use 27 by delegates. Any new tool deployment would require rigorous market and user research, product 28 B of T Rep. 2 0-A-23 -- page 4 of 4 development roadmaps, and significant data exchange infrastructure among states and specialties 1 that do not exist today. We anticipate there would be a high degree of manual data entry and 2 monitoring for changes that would require dedicated staff members. Additionally, a multi- 3 organization governance mechanism would need to be established that describes the prioritization 4 dimensions . We believe this would be a significant cost burden among AMA and the Federation, 5 without adding great value for the AMA, delegates, and societie s. 6 7 Federation Activities 8 9 The experience of accessing policy and council reports from our F ederation ranges widely. State 10 and s pecialty societies ' resources and capabilities devoted to policy databases and reporting 11 systems are unknown but likely vary widely. 12 13 We reviewed options for three state medical societies. One society has testimony, letters, and 14 advocacy content available to the public, but the reports of its councils are not publicly available. 15 Another state medical society provided a downloadable Policy Compendium from their House of 16 Delegates but the link was broken. A nother state medical association did not have a similar option. 17 18 One large specialty societ y provided a functi onal public database to browse Guidelines, Expert 19 Consensus Statements, Policy Documents, and artifacts . Another specialty examined did not have 20 any discernable publicly available database or archive of materials from their annual meeting. 21 22 RECOMMENDATION 23 24 In view of these considerations, your AMA recommends that the following recommendations be 25 adopted in lieu of Resolution 609- A-22 and that the remainder of this report be filed: 26 27 1. That our American Medical Association (AMA) maintains the existing resolution management 28 structure within the H ouse of Delegates without imposing a potentially confusing or 29 unsustainable prioritization matrix on delegates and reference committees. ( New HOD Policy) 30 31 2. That our AMA continues to invest in critical information technology and other appropriate 32 infrastructure that allows for the tracking of past resolutions, existing policy, and supporting 33 materials.

Policy G -600.010 reads as follows, laying out the parameters for 3 review and specifying the procedure s to follow: 4 5 1. As the House of Delegates (House ) adopts policies, a maximum ten -year time horizon shall 6 exist. A policy will typically sunset after ten years unless action is taken by the H ouse to retain 7 it. Any action of our AMA House that reaffirms or amends an existing policy position shall 8 reset the sunset \" clock, \" making the reaffirmed or amended policy viable for another 10 years. 9 10 2. In the implementation and ongoing operation of our AMA policy sunset mechanism, the 11 following procedures shall be followed: (a) Each year, the Speakers shall provide a list of 12 policies that are subject to review under the policy sunset mechanism; (b) Such policies shall 13 be assigned to the appropriate AMA councils for review; (c) Each AMA council that has been 14 asked to review policies shall develop and submit a report t o the H ouse identifying policies 15 that are scheduled to sunset; (d) For each policy under review, the reviewing council can 16 recommend one of the following actions: (i) retain the policy; (ii) sunset the policy; (iii) retain 17 part of the policy; or (iv) reconcile the policy with more recent and like policy (per Policy G - 18 600.111(4) , The consolidation process permits editorial amendments for the sake of clarity, so 19 long as the proposed changes are transparent to the House and do not change the meaning) ; (e) 20 For each recommendation that it makes to retain a policy in any fashion, the reviewing council 21 shall provide a succinct, but cogent justification (f) The Speakers shall determine the best way 22 for the House to handle the sunset reports. 23 24 3. Nothing in this poli cy shall prohibit a report to the H ouse or resolution to sunset a policy 25 earlier than its 10 -year horizon if it is no longer relevant, has been superseded by a more 26 current policy, or has been accomplished. 27 28 4. The AMA councils and the H ouse should conform to the following guidelines for sunset: (a) 29 when a policy is no longer relevant or necessary; (b) when a policy or directive has been 30 accomplished; or (c) when the policy or directive is part of an established AMA practice that 31 is transparent to the House and codified elsewhere such as the AMA Bylaws or the AMA 32 House of Delegates Reference Manual: Procedures, Policies and Practices. 33 34 5. The most recent policy shall be deemed to supersede contradictory past AMA policies. 35 CCB/CLRPD Joint Rep. 01 -A-23 -- page 2 of 10 6. Sunset policies will be retained in the AMA historical archives 1 2 RECOMMENDATION 3 4 The Councils on Constitution and Bylaws and Long Range Planning and Development 5 recommend that the House of Delegates policies that are listed in the appendix to this report be 6 acted upon in the manner indicated and the remainder of this report be filed. 7 CCB/CLRPD Joint Rep. 01-A-23 -- page 3 of 10 APPENDIX - Recommended Actions Policy Number Title Text Recommendation D-405.991 Clarification of the Title \"Doctor\" in the Hospital Environment 1. Our AMA Commissioners will, for the purpose of patient safety, request that The Joint Commission develop and implement standards for an identification system for all hospital facility staff who have direct contact with patients which would require that an identification badge be worn which indicates the individual's name and credentials as appropriate (i.e., MD, DO, RN, LPN, DC, DPM, DDS, etc), to differentiate between those who have achieved a Doctorate, and those with other types of credentials. 2. Ou r AMA Commissioners will, for the purpose of patient safety, request that The Joint Commission develop and implement new standards that require anyone in a hospital environment who has direct contact with a patient who presents himself or herself to the pa tient as a \"doctor,\" and who is not a \"physician\" according to the AMA definition (H -405.969) that a physician is an individual who has received a \"Doctor of Medicine\" or a \"Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine\" degree or an equivalent degree following successfu l completion of a prescribed course of study from a school of medicine or osteopathic medicine?) must specifically and simultaneously declare themselves a \"non -physician\" and define the nature of their doctorate degree. 3. Our AMA will request the American Osteopathic Association (AOA) to (1) expand their standards to include proper identification of all medical staff and hospital personnel with their applicable credential (i.e., MD, DO, RN, LPN, DC, DPM, DDS, etc), and (2) Require anyone in a hospital envi ronment who has direct contact with a patient presenting himself or herself to the patient as a \"doctor\", who is not a \"Physician\" according to the AMA definition (AMA Policy H -405.969 .. that a physician is an individual who has received a \"Doctor of Medicine\" or a \"Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine\" degree or an equivalent degree following successful completion of a prescribed course of study from a school of medicine or osteopathic medicine) must specifically and simultaneously declare themselves a \"non- physician\" and define the nature of their doctorate degree.

Each online member forum should cover as many items of business as possible, including, at minimum, those items that appear in the initial compilation of the Delegate Handbook; c. Comments submitted to an online member forum should be used to prepare a summary report that reflects the comments received up to that point; d. Full, free and complete testimony should be allowed in the onsite hearings; and e. The Speakers should experiment with alternative procedures to enhance and improve the overall online member forum process. Online Reference Committee , commits our AMA to a two - year study of preliminary reference committee document s based on the written online testimony , with those documents being used to inform the discussion at the in-person reference committee. G-615.001 Establishment and Function of Sections 1. Our AMA adopts the following criteria in consideration of requests for establishing new sections or changing the status of member component groups: A. Issue of Concern - Focus will relate to concerns that are distinctive to the subset within th e broader, general issues that face medicine. A demonstrated need exists to deal with these matters, as they are not currently being addressed through an existing AMA group. B. Consistency - Objectives and activities of the group are consistent with those of the AMA. Activities make good use of available resources and are not duplicative. C. Appropriateness - The structure of the group will be consistent with its objectives and activities. D. Representation Threshold - Members of the formal group would be based on identifiable segments of the physician population and AMA membership. The formal group would be a clearly identifiable segment of AMA membership and the general physician population. A substantial number of members would be represented by this formal group. At minimum, this group would be able to represent 1,000 AMA members. It is important to note this threshold will not be used to determine representation as each new group will be allocated only one delegate and one alternate delegate. E. Stabi lity - The group has a demonstrated history of continuity. This segment can demonstrate an ongoing and viable group of physicians will be represented by this section and both the segment and the AMA will benefit from an increased voice within the policymak ing body. F. Accessibility - Provides opportunity for members of the constituency who are otherwise underrepresented to introduce issues of concern and to be able to participate in the policymaking process within the HOD. 2. Our AMA will consider requests for establishing new sections by letter of application to the CLRPD, which will make recommendations to the Retain. Still relevant and necessary to specify the criteria used to evaluat e new sections or changing the status of a member component group. A five -year review cycle of delineated sections provides an excellent opportunity for the House to receive updates on section activities to ensure that these sections continue to mee t HOD goals .

Our AMA annual strategic planning cycle shall include the following dimensions: (a) Information: Our AMA strategic planning process shall be based on information about the environment in which medicine and our AMA must function. Drawing from a variety of sources including public and physician survey data, other types of research findings and data, and the work of our AMA councils, sections, and special groups, the Council on Long Range Planning and Development (CLRPD) shall provide st rategic support to our AMA Board by identifying, analyzing, and interpreting environmental trends. The Board of Trustees and the CLRPD shall work collaboratively to distribute information on the environment and our AMA's vision, objectives, and strategies to all the participants in the strategic planning process. (b) Participation: Our AMA strategic planning process should provide for broad participation by the House of Delegates, Councils, Sections, Special Groups, staff, and other appropriate internal and external sources. The Board of Trustees shall provide opportunities for these entities to provide input into the development of our AMA's strategic plan. 2. Our AMA strategic planning process should generate: (a) A multi -year plan that identifies the most critical strategic issues for the organization; (b) The critical success factors for each issue; and (c) Annual work plans with measurable performance objectives, tasks and timelines, assignments for implementation, and expected outcomes. 3. The Board mus t ensure that adequate resources - staff, funding, and material - are available for developing our AMA strategic plan. 4. The goals of our AMA strategic plan should become an overarching part of all Board and Council meetings. All ongoing initiatives and n ew undertakings must be regularly measured against the plan, and emerging issues that impact the plan should be identified. 5. The AMA strategic plan will be presented to the HOD in a more visible, proactive, and interactive way. 6. Our AMA Board of Trustees will continue to (a) consider input from the House, CLRPD, and broad physician community when developing the Strategic Plan and making resource allocation decisions; (b) exercise its fiduciary responsibilities with respect to allocating resources appropriately and consistent with the AMA's vision, goals and priorities; and (c) monitor the activity and results related to commitments established in the planning process.

Still Relevant and Necessary H-40.993 Support of the Civilian -Military Contingency Hospital System The AMA supports the CMCHS and urges U.S. civilian hospitals, when requested, to provide all possible support to the Department of Defense CMCHS in this important effort which will enable the U.S. to prepare for the treatment of casualties from any future conventional military conflict. Retain. Still Relevant. H-475.992 Definitions of \"Cosmetic\" and \"Reconstructive\" Surgery (1) Our AMA supports the following definitions of \"cosmetic\" and \"reconstructive\" surgery: Cosmetic surgery is performed to reshape normal structures of the body in order to improve the patient's appearance and self -esteem. Reconstructive surgery is performed on abnormal structures of the body, caused by congenital defects, developmental abnormalities, trauma, infection, tumors or disease. It is generally performed to improve function, but may also be done to approximate a normal appearance. (2) Our A MA encourages third party payers to use these definitions in determining services eligible for coverage under the plans they offer or administer. Retain. Still Relevant. H-475.983 Definition of Surgery Our AMA adopts the following definition of 'surgery' from American College of Surgeons Statement ST -11: Surgery is performed for the purpose of structurally altering the human body by the incision or destruction of tissues and is part of the practice of medicine. Surgery also is the diagnostic or therapeutic treatment of conditions or disease processes by any instruments causing localized alteration or transposition of live human tissue which include lasers, ultrasound, ionizing radiation, scalpels, probes, and needles. The tissue can be cut, burned, vaporized, frozen, sutured, probed, or manipulated by closed reductions for major dislocations or fractures, or otherwise altered by mechanical, thermal, light- based, electromagnetic, or chemical means. Injection of diagnostic or therapeutic substances into body cavities, internal organs, joints, sensory organs, and the central nervous system also is considered to be surgery (this does not include the administration by nursing personnel of some injections, subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous, when ordered by a physician). All of these surgical procedures are invasive, including those that are performed with lasers, and the risks Retain. Still Relevant. CCB/CLRPD Joint Rep. 01-A-23 -- page 8 of 10 of any surgical procedure are not eliminated by using a light knife or laser in place of a metal knife, or scalpel. Patient safety and quality of care are paramount and, therefore, patients should be assured that individuals who perform these types of surgery are licensed physicians (defined as doctors of medicine or osteopathy) who meet appropriate professional standards. H-475.988 Laser Surgery The AMA supports the position that revision, destruction, incision or other structural alteration of human tissue using laser is surgery. Rescind (duplicative of Policy H-475.983 being recommended for retention ). H-475.984 Office -Based Surgery Regulation Our AMA supports the following Core Principles on Office -Based Surgery: Core Principle #1: Guidelines or regulations for office -based surgery should be developed by states according to levels of anesthesia defined by the American Society of Anesthesiologis ts (ASA) excluding local anesthesia or minimal sedation. (American Society of Anesthesiologists. 2, 2013). Core Principle #2: Physicians shoul d select patients for office -based surgery using moderate sedation/analgesia, deep sedation/analgesia or general anesthesia by criteria including the ASA Physical Status Classification System and so document. (American Society of Anesthesiologists. ASA physical status classification system. Available at: https://www.asahq.org/standards -status - classification -system.aspx. Accessed July 2, 2013). Core Principle #3: Physicians who perform office - based surgery with moderate sedation/analgesia, deep sedation/analgesia, or general anesthesia should have their facilities accredited by The Joint Commission, Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC), American Association for Accreditation of Ambulatory Surgical Facilities (AAAASF), American Osteopathic Association (AOA), or by a state recognized entity, such as the Institute for Medical Quality (IMQ), or be state licensed and/or Medicare certified. Core Principle #4: Physicians performing office -based surgery with moderate sedation/analgesia, deep sedation/analgesia, or general anesthesia must have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital, or a transfer agreement with Retain as editoriall y amended for accuracy. Still relevant. CCB/CLRPD Joint Rep. 01-A-23 -- page 9 of 10 another physician who has admitting privileges at a nearby hospital, or maintain an emergency transfer agreement with a nearby hospital. Core Principle #5: States should follow the guidelines outlined by the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) regarding informed consent. (Report of the Special Committee on Outpatient [Office - Based] Surgery. ( Med. Licensure Discipline. 2002; 88:-160-174). Core Principle #6: For office surgery with moderate sedation/analgesia, deep sedation/analgesia, or general anesthesia, states should consider legally privilege d adverse incident reporting requirements as recommended by the FSMB and accompanied by periodic peer review and a program of Continuous Quality Improvement. ( Report of the Special Committee on Outpatient (Office -Based) Surgery. Jo urnal Medical Licensure and Discipline. 2002; 88:160- 174). Core Principle #7: Physicians performing office -based surgery using moderate sedation/analgesia, deep sedation/analgesia or general anesthesia must obtain and maintain board certification by one of the boards recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties, American Osteopathic Association, or a board with equivalent standards approved by the state medical board within five years of completing an approved residency training program. The procedure must be one that is generally recognized by that certifying board as falling within the scope of training and practice of the physician providing the care. Core Principle #8 : Physicians performing office -based surgery with moderate sedation/analgesia, deep sedation/analgesia, or general anesthesia may show competency by maintaining core privileges at an accredited or licensed hospital or ambulatory surgical center, for the pr ocedures they perform in the office setting. Alternatively, the governing body of the office facility is responsible for a peer review process for privileging physicians based on nationally recognized credentialing standards. Core Principle #9: For office -based surgery with moderate sedation/analgesia, deep sedation/analgesia, or general anesthesia, at least one physician who is credentialed or currently recognized as having successfully completed a course in advanced resuscitative techniques (e.g., ATLS, ACLS, or PALS), must be present or immediately available with age - and size- appropriate resuscitative equipment until the patient has met the criteria for discharge from the facility. In addition, other medical personnel with direct patient contact should a t a minimum be trained in Basic Life Support (BLS). Core Principle #10: Physicians administering or supervising moderate sedation/analgesia, deep sedation/analgesia, or general anesthesia should have appropriate education and training. CCB/CLRPD Joint Rep. 01-A-23 -- page 10 of 10 D-478.977 Exam Room Computing and Patient Physician Interactions Our AMA will make physicians aware of tips and resources for effectively using computers and electronic health records (EHRs) in patient- physician interactions through AMA publication vehicles, and encourages physicians to incorporate questions regarding use of computers and EHRs in patient- satisfaction surveys to provide feedback on how their own patients experience the use of comp uters in the examination room. Sunset. The actions requested have been accomplished. The AMA's STEPS Forward practice management tools, found at the AMA Ed Hub , provide physicians with in -depth CME on acquisition and efficient use of an EHR. Modules include \"Electronic Health Record (EHR) Software Selection and Purchase \" and \" Electronic Health Record Optimization: Strategies for Thriving ,\" which include techniques physicians and office staff can use to \"maximize the benefits and minimize the burdens of the EHR.\" The AMA Ed Hub also includes a substantial selection of EHR case studies. An additional resource is AMA's Taming the EHR Playbook. Policy, H-480.971 , commits our AMA to continued work in this area. AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 601 (A-23) Introduced by: Resident and Fellow Section Subject: Solicitation Using the AMA Brand Referred to: Reference Committee F Whereas, Some physicians are turned off by third -party solicitation material mailed with the 1 American Medical Association brand, such as regarding disability insurance or student loan 2 refinancing, potentially harming the AMA's reputation and costing physician membership; and 3 4 Whereas, Financial literacy websites such as White Coat Investor detail the flaws in the AMA 5 branded third- party disability insurance plan1; and 6 7 Whereas, There is a financial and environmental cost to printed solicitation; and 8 9 Whereas, Associating the AMA brand to specific third- party products may or may not be in the 10 best interest of the AMA or current and potential AMA members; therefore be it 11 12 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association study the use of AMA branded solicitation 13 material mailed to physicians, the impact it has on the perception of our AMA by current and 14 potential physician members, and the merits of cont inuing to use these materials in future 15 communications (Directive to Take Action) ; and be it further 16 17 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association survey our membership on the preferred 18 method to receive third- party solicitation material (mail, phone, email, social media) and provide 19 a method to opt -out of certain methods if not desired. (Directive to Take Action) 20 Fiscal Note: M inimal - less than $1,000 Received: 3/19/23 REFERENCES 1. AMA's Disability Insurance: You Get What You Pay For - White Coat Investor AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 602 (A-23) Introduced by: Medical Student Section Subject: Supporting the Use of Gender -Neutral Language Referred to: Reference Committee F Whereas, Existing American Medical Association policy inconsistently uses gendered language- 1 in particular, gender pronouns - when referring to physicians, medical students, patients, and 2 others, most often referencing generic individuals with traditionally male and sometimes female 3 pronouns (\"he/him/his\", \"he or she\", \"his or hers\"); and 4 5 Whereas, One of many examples of gendered language is AMA Poli cy H-140.951, which states 6 \"Our AMA believes that the primary mission of the physician is to use his best efforts and skill in 7 the care of his patients...\"; and 8 9 Whereas, The American medical profession is increasingly gender diverse: 50.5% of all current 10 U.S. medical students are women, and there many medical students and physicians who have 11 other genders that are not male or female, including gender -expansive, gender -fluid, gender - 12 nonconforming, genderqueer, nonbinary, and others1,2,7; and 13 14 Whereas, The frequent default use of male pronouns to describe generic physicians in AMA 15 policy (for example, using \"him\" and \"his\" as pronouns for \"the physician\") may reinforce 16 patriarchal (pro -male) bias in medicine and disadvantage physicians who do not use such 17 pronouns3-6; and 18 19 Whereas, Gender identity exists on a spectrum that includes cisgender individuals whose 20 gender identity aligns with their sex assigned at birth and transgender individuals whose gender 21 identity differs from their sex assigned at birth8; and 22 23 Whereas, Cisnormative, gender -specific language has been shown to contribute to health 24 disparities and alienate gender -diverse people from accessing care 9-12; and 25 26 Whereas, The use of cisnormative, gender -specific language in public health campaigns such 27 as breast cancer screening, testicular cancer awareness, HPV vaccination, and dissemination 28 of PrEP has contributed to health disparities that negatively impact gender -diverse patients13-15; 29 and 30 31 Whereas, Cisgendered imagery in medical education including anatomical diagrams has been 32 demonstrated to exacerbate gender bias in students and contribute to students' reduced 33 comfort and knowledge in treating gender -diverse patients16-17; and 34 35 Whereas, Reputable organizations and government departments that guide the public via public 36 health communication continue to use gendered messaging that excludes gender -diverse 37 individuals; for example, alcoholic beverage warning labels that read \" women should not drink 38 alcoholic beverages during pregnancy because of the risk of birth defects\" 18; and 39 Resolution: 602 (A-23) Page 2 of 5 Whereas, The use of gendered messaging in spaces such as Women's Health Clinics with pink 1 chairs, patient restrooms labeled as a \"women's\" restrooms, and brochures containing language 2 helpful for cisgender women only, have been shown to be stigmatizing and isolating for gender - 3 diverse individuals and may discourage them from accessing necessary services19; and 4 5 Whereas, Gender -neutral language has been shown to positively impact the comfort and 6 psychological safety of gender -diverse individuals \"in the institutions with which they must 7 interact\" 20; and 8 9 Whereas, To address the exclusion of gender -diverse individuals through the use of gendered 10 messaging, peer organizations are already adopting gender -neutral language, including the 11 Section on Women's Health of the American Physical Therapy Association whi ch changed its 12 name to the Academy of Pelvic Health Physical Therapy and the American College of 13 Obstetricians and Gynecologists which released Committee Opinion 823 recognizing that not all 14 pregnant individuals may identify as \"mothers\" 21-22; and 15 16 Whereas, The AMA should aspire to use gender -neutral language where feasible, recognizing 17 that American physicians and the patients we serve have diverse gender identities and may use 18 similarly diverse personal pronouns; and 19 20 Whereas, One solution for correcting the bias established by using traditionally male pronouns 21 as default in AMA policy is to replace them with gender -neutral pronouns such as \"they\", \"them\", 22 \"their\", and \"theirs\", which are pronouns used by many gender non -binary individuals and may 23 also be used to collectively describe people of all genders7; and 24 25 Whereas, The pronouns \"they\", \"them\", \"their\", and \"theirs\" have long been widely accepted as 26 both singular and plural pronouns, allowing them to be incorporated into AMA policy with great 27 flexibility23-25; and 28 29 Whereas, Adopting consistent gender -neutral pronouns and other non- gendered language into 30 AMA policy would be an efficient and adequate way to collectively reference medical students, 31 physicians, patients, and others of all genders; and 32 33 Whereas, Updating the language in our AMA's policies to be maximally inclusive is a simple act 34 that aligns with our organization's work to document and appreciate the diversity in sexual 35 orientation and gender identity (SOGI) of our members as well as to cha mpion gender equity 36 and non- discrimination in medicine and society26-31; and 37 38 Whereas, AMA policy D -65.990, which calls on the AMA to standardize existing and future 39 language relating to LGBTQ people, establishes precedent for this timely action; therefore be it 40 41 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association (1) Recognize the importance of using 42 gender -neutral language such as gender neutral pronouns, terms, imagery, and symbols in 43 respecting the spectrum of gender identity, (2) revise all relevant policies to utilize gender - 44 neutral language in place of gendered language where such text inappropriately appears, (3) 45 utilize gender -neutral language in future policies, internal communications, and external 46 communications where gendered language does not specifically need to be used, (4) 47 encourage the use of gender -neutral language in public health and medical messaging, (5) 48 encourage other professional societies to utilize gender -neutral language in their work, and (6) 49 support the use of gender -neutral language in clinical spaces that may serve both cisgender 50 and gender -diverse individuals.

Advocating for LGBTQ AMA AMA POLICY Professionalism in Medicine H -140.951 Our AMA believes that the primary mission of the physician is to use his best efforts and skill in the care of his patients and to be mindful of those forces in society that would erode fundamental ethical medical practice. The AMA affirms that the medical profession is solely responsible for establishing and maintaining standards of professional medical ethics and that the state neither legislate ethical standards nor excuse physicians from their ethical obligations. The AMA House of Delegates, Board of Trustees, staff, and membership rededicate themselves to professionalism such that it permeates all activities and is the defining characteristic of the AMA's identity. Citation: Res. 4, A -95; Reaffirmed: CEJA Rep. 03, A-19; Strategies for Enhancing Diversity in the Physician Workforce H -200.951 Our AMA: (1) supports increased diversity across all specialties in the physician workforce in the categories of race, ethnicity, disability status, sexual orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic origin, and rurality; (2) commends the Institute of Medicine (now known as the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine) for its report, \"In the Nation's Compelling Interest: Ensuring Diversity in the Health Care Workforce,\" and supports the concept that a racially and ethnically diverse educational experience results in better educational outcomes; (3) encourages the development of evidence- informed programs to build role models among academic leadership and faculty for the mentorship of students, residents, and fellows underrepresented in medicine and in specific specialties; (4) encourages physicians to engage in their communities to guide, support, and mentor high school and undergraduate students with a calling to medicine; (5) encourages medical schools, health care institutions, managed care and other appropriate groups to adopt and utilize activities that bolster efforts to include and support individuals who are underrepresented in medicine by developing policies that articulate the value and importance of diversity as a goal that benefits all participants, cultivating and funding programs that nurture a culture of diversity on campus, and recruiting faculty and staff who share this goal; and (6) continue to study and provide recommendations to improve the future of health equity and racial justice in medical education, the diversity of the health workforce, and the outcomes of marginalized patient populations.

Citation: Res. 016, A -18; AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 603 (A-23) Introduced by: Medical Student Section Subject: Environmental Sustainability of AMA National Meetings Referred to: Reference Committee F Whereas, The World Health Organization (WHO) and our AMA have called climate change 1 \"the greatest public health challenge of the 21st century\"1,2; and 2 3 Whereas, Reputable entities including the WHO, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 4 Change (IPCC), and U.S. Global Change Research Program assert that climate change has 5 had an effect on, and continues to pose a great risk for, human health through climate related 6 extreme weather events, worsening air quality, and increased disease transmission1,3,4; and 7 8 Whereas, Climate change is primarily driven through human activity and the release of 9 greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere5; and 10 11 Whereas, The United States healthcare system alone is responsible for 10% of national 12 greenhouse gas emissions and, if it were its own country, it would be the 13th largest 13 producer of greenhouse gas emissions in the world6,7; and 14 15 Whereas, Extreme weather and climate events have significantly increased healthcare 16 spending in the United States, with $14 billion in additional spending through 760,000 17 additional patient encounters and 1,689 premature deaths between 2000 and 20098,9; and 18 19 Whereas, The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has determined it is 20 possible to avoid warming past 1.5\u00b0C above pre -industrial levels by 2100 if extreme 21 measures are taken to curtail anthropogenic emissions10; and 22 23 Whereas, If global warming exceeds 1.5\u00b0C, the estimated global effects include 92,207 24 additional heat -related deaths per year by 2030, 350 million more humans exposed to severe 25 heat by 2050, and 31 to 69 million humans exposed to flooding from sea level rise by 210010; 26 and 27 28 Whereas, Compared to no action, limiting global warming to less than 1.5\u00b0C would result in 29 ~50% lower annual health- related costs and prevention of ~50% of infectious disease cases 30 in the United States by 21008,9; and 31 32 Whereas, The IPCC has estimated that limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C would require \"global 33 net human- caused emissions of carbon dioxide to fall by about 45 percent from 2010 levels 34 by 2030, and reach net zero by approximately 2050\"10; and 35 36 Whereas, IPCC defines net zero emissions as a state where anthropogenic emissions of 37 greenhouse gasses (GHG) are balanced by anthropogenic removals of GHG over a specific 38 time period8; and 39 Resolution: 603 (A-23) Page 2 of 7 Whereas, Setting emissions targets is an essential part of carbon abatement, and many non- 1 profit organizations, large corporations, and countries have committed to carbon neutrality for 2 their business operations by a date certain in order to improve their business efficiencies and 3 to foster the development of carbon neutral practices11-13; and 4 5 Whereas, Multiple organizations in the healthcare industry have committed to becoming 6 carbon neutral on or before 2030, including Harvard Medical School and its affiliated 7 hospitals, all University of California campus and medical centers, the Cleveland Clinic, and 8 Kaiser -Permanante14-17; and 9 10 Whereas, Other professional organizations, including the Association of Energy Services 11 Professionals, and International Federation of Medical Students' Associations have 12 committed to making their conferences carbon neutral18,19; and 13 14 Whereas, Our American Medical Association has set discrete benchmark dates for achieving 15 goals in other settings, including child blood lead levels (H -60.924), accreditation of health 16 care service providers in jails (D -430.997), and disaggregation of demographi c data (H - 17 350.954); and 18 19 Whereas, Our AMA has substantial policy recognizing the impacts of climate change, 20 committing to sustainable business operations, emphasizing the importance of physician 21 leadership regarding climate change, encouraging the study of environmental causes of 22 disease, and encouraging other stakeholders in healthcare to practice environmental 23 responsibility, but has no explicit emissions goal and no way to account for progress towards 24 environmental sustainability (H- 135.938, H -135.923, G -630.100, D -135.997, H -135.973); 25 therefore be it 26 27 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association commit to reaching net zero emissions 28 for its business operations by 2030, and remain net zero or net negative, as defined by a 29 carbon neutral certifying organization, and report annually on the AMA's progress towards 30 implementation (New HOD Policy) ; and be it further 31 32 RESOLVED, That our AMA work with appropriate stakeholders to encourage the United 33 States healthcare system, including but not limited to hospitals, clinics, ambulatory care 34 centers, and healthcare professionals, to decrease emissions to half of 2010 levels by 2030 35 and become net zero by 2050, and remain net zero or negative, as defined by a carbon 36 neutral certifying organization, including by crea ting educational materials (Directive to Take 37 Action) ; and be it further 38 39 RESOLVED, That our AMA evaluate the feasibility of purchasing carbon offsets for members 40 traveling to and from Annual and Interim meetings and report back to the House of Delegates 41 (Directive to Take Action) ; and be it further 42 43 RESOLVED, That our AMA evaluate the feasibility of holding future Annual and Interim 44 meetings at Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design- certified or sustainable 45 conference centers and report back to the House of Delegates.

Citation: Res. 001, I -17; Appended: Res. 403, A -19; Reducing Lead Poisoning H -60.924 1. Our AMA: (a) supports regulations and policies designed to protect young children from exposure to lead; (b) urges the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to give priority to examining the current weight of scientific evidence regarding the range of adverse health effects associated with blood lead concentrations below the current \"level of concern\" in order to provide appropriate guidance for physicians and public health policy, and encourage the identification of exposure pathways for children who have low blood lead concentrations, as well as effective and innovative strategies to r educe overall childhood lead exposure; (c) encourages physicians and public health departments to screen children based on current recommendations and guidelines and to report all children with elevated blood levels to the appropriate health department in their state or community in order to fully assess the burden of lead exposure in children. In some cases this will be done by the physician, and in other communities by the laboratories; (d) promotes community awareness of the hazard of lead- based paints; and (e) urges paint removal product manufacturers to print precautions about the removal of lead paint to be included with their products where and when sold. 2. Our AMA will call on the United States government to establish national goals to: (a) ensure t hat no child has a blood lead level >5 g/dL (>50 ppb)by 2021, and (b) eliminate lead exposures to pregnant women and children, so that by 2030, no child would have a blood lead level >1 g/dL (10 ppb). 3. Our AMA will call on the United States government in all its agencies to pursue the following strategies to achieve these goals: (a) adopt health- based standards and action levels for lead that rely on the most up-to-date scientific knowledge to prevent and reduce human exposure to lead, and assure prompt implementation of the strongest available measures to protect pregnant women and children from lead toxicity and neurodevelopmental impairment; (b) identify and remediate current and potential new sources of lead exposure (in dust, air, soil, water and cons umer products) to protect children before they are exposed; (c) continue targeted screening of children to identify those who already have elevated blood lead levels for case management, as well as educational and other services; (d) eliminate new sources of lead introduced or released into the environment, which may entail banning or phasing out all remaining uses of lead in products (aviation gas, cosmetics, wheel weights, industrial paints, batteries, lubricants, and other sources), and the export of products containing lead, and setting more protective limits on emissions from battery recyclers and other sources of lead emissions; (e) provide a dedicated funding stream to enhance the resources available to identify and eliminate sources of lead exposure, and provide educational, social and clinical services to mitigate the harms of lead toxicity, particularly to protect and improve the lives of children in communities that are disproportionately exposed to lead; and (f) establish an independent expert adv isory committee to develop a long- term national strategy, including recommendations for funding and implementation, to achieve the national goal of eliminating lead toxicity in pregnant women and children, defined as blood lead levels above 1 g/dL (10 ppb) . 4.Our AMA supports requiring an environmental assessment of dwellings, residential buildings, or child care facilities following the notification that a child occupant or frequent inhabitant has a confirmed elevated blood lead level, to determine the pot ential source of lead poisoning, including testing the water supply.

REPORT 14 OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES (A -23) Advocacy of Private Practice Options for Healthcare Operations in Larg e Corporations (Reference Committee G ) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY At the 2022 Annual Meeting of the House of Delegates , Policy D -160.912, \"Advocacy of Private Practice Options for Healthcare Operations in Large Corporations ,\" was adopted. The policy directs the American Medical Association to (1) study the best method to create pilot programs which advance the advocacy of private practice and small business medicine within the rapidly growing area of internal health care within Fortune 500 corporations in America with a report back at the 2023 Annual Meeting, (2) use proposals for the advocacy of small business medicine and private practice models in health care as a pilot project in the development of advocacy programs within major leading corporations like Amazon and Walmart which are currently entering the health care service market with internalized models of health care in the complete absence of more diverse private practice (small business) options, and (3) prioritize advocacy efforts that emphasize small private practice utilization within the investment and business efforts of Fortune 500 corporations that are curren tly seeking to enter into the health care industry (Directive to Take Action). To study po tential pilot s to advance t he advocacy of private practice within corporate health care, the AMA conducted a market landscape assessment based on publicly available news articles and studie s. Confidential informational interviews were undertaken among a small sam ple of national corporate entiti es with individuals directly responsible for each organization's strategy in care delivery. The se interviews were conducted with a series of pre- determined questions regarding their approaches and strategic thinking on care delivery and the role of private practices in the communit y. Three key themes emerged from th is market analysis : 1. Corporate entit ies are increasingly investing in opportunities in care delive ry and believe this strategy will increase value for their insured employees , their customers and shareholders. 2. Corporations believe \"value- based\" payment and delivery models will drive better patient outcomes and lower health care costs and are investing heavily in these models. 3. While acquisition of independent practices is ac celerating in certain markets, some cor porate entities, particularly among vertically integrated health insurers, have a strategy of working with independent practices in communities . These companie s express a goal of supporting integrated networks of practices , with the aim of providing more enhanced, coordin ated care for patients and preven ting practice acquisition by large r health care systems or hospitals that can lead to consolidation and attendant price increases. Newer corporate retail and technology entrants will continue experimen ting with various arrangements subject to market conditions and shareholder priorities. Based on the market assessment , the AMA identified vital opportuni ties to (1) inform corporat ions about the value of private practices in successfully implementing new \"value- based\" models; (2) identify and work with a specific corporate entity advancing these models to explore a two-year pilot with independent private practices in which the AMA will: ( a) convene practices in a community; ( b) provide educational resources and technical assistance to practices to support participation in a pi lot; and ( c) formally evaluate the pilot for outcomes ; and (3) continue advocacy that improves \"value - based\" mode ls to ensure that physicians can s ucceed in these models with adequate payment, infrastructure and data. \u00a9 2023 American Medical Association.

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES B of T Report 14 -A-23 Subject: Advocacy of Private Practice Options for Healthcare Operations in Large Corporations Presented by: Sandra Adamson Fryhofer, MD , Chair Referred to: Reference Committee G INTRODUCTION 1 2 At the 2022 Annual Meeting , the House of Delegates (HOD) adopted P olicy D -160.912, 3 \"Advocacy of Private Practice Options for Healthcare Operations in Large Corporations .\" This 4 policy directs our American Medical Association (AMA ) to: (1) study the best method to create 5 pilot programs which advance the advocacy of private practice and small business medicine within 6 the rapidly growing area of internal healthcare within Fortune 500 corporations in America wi th a 7 report back at the 2023 Annual Meeting ; (2) use proposals for the advocacy of small business 8 medicine and private practice models in healthcare as a pilot project in the development of 9 advocacy programs within major leading corporations like Amazon and Walmart which are 10 currently entering the healthcare service market with internalized models of healthcare in the 11 complete absence of more diverse private practice (small business) options, and (3) prioritize 12 advocacy efforts that emphasize small private practice utilization within the investment and 13 business efforts of Fortune 500 corporations that are currently seeking to enter into the healthcare 14 industry. 15 16 BACKGROUND: 17 18 Over the last two decades, large corporations have increasingly entered health care delivery\u2014a 19 trend that has accelerated following the onset of the COVID -19 pandemic. These entities include 20 Walmart, CVS, Walgreens and Amazon, as well as national health insurance corporations such as 21 UnitedHealth Group. Ev en unexpected corporate retailers like Dollar General are offering health 22 care delivery models. These corporations have assumed various roles within health care, such as in - 23 person and virtual health care delivery, pharmaceuticals, wellness and employer -sponsored health 24 insurance. 25 26 Following blocked mergers of Aetna -Humana and Anthem -Cigna in 2017, these large national 27 insurers, along with United Healthcare , accelerated acquisitions of other types of heal th care 28 companies.1 This represented a shift from horizontal integration (two health insurers merging) to 29 vertical integration (different parts of the health care delivery system merging). These acquisitions 30 and mergers include retail pharmacies (e.g., Aetna -CVS), pharmacy benefit managers (e.g., Cigna - 31 Express Scripts) and data/analytic companies (e.g., United- Change Healthcare). In addition, these 32 organizations are acquiring a broad spectrum of health care delivery organizations , from physician 33 practices to home health c ompanies to mental health care companies. For example , UnitedHealth 34 Group's Optum Health is now the largest employer of physicians in the count ry.2 35 B of T Rep. 14 -A-23 - Page 2 of 15 In addition to traditional health insurers, new entrants such as large retailers (e.g., Walmart) and 1 new and established technology companies (e.g., Amazon) are entering the health care delivery 2 space. These organizations are entering health care del ivery as a new revenue source to drive 3 shareholder value, create synergy with other portions of their business (e.g., pharmacy) and help 4 control employee health care costs.3,4,5,6 While these investments have not been as expansive as the 5 large national health insurers, they will likely shake up health care delivery with new models of 6 pricing, the integration of technology and alignment with their other offerings. 7 8 The consumerization of health care is one factor that has fostered opportunities for corporations not 9 traditionally involved in health care delivery to enter these spaces and offer greater convenience at 10 a lower cost.3 Occurring alongside this trend is the acquisition of independent physician practices 11 by these large corporations, as well as by hospitals and payers. According to one estimate, 12 corporate entities acquired over 30,000 additional physician practices between 2019 and 2021.7 The 13 2020 AMA Physician Pr actice Benchmark survey found that less than half of patient care 14 physicians worked in private practice, nearly five percent lower than two years prior.8 15 16 Some see this trend of corp orate entry into health care as positive, believing it will make health 17 care more sustainable and provide physicians greater access to capital, negotiating power and the 18 latest technology. However, others view it as disruptive to high -quality, coordinated care delivered 19 by a physician- led team , believing it decreas es access and competitio n.8 There is also limited 20 scrutiny of th e impact on market competition, as s ome proposed transactions involving the 21 corporate acquisition of physician practices may not com e to the attention of antitrust enforce rs if 22 the transaction is not sufficiently large enough to trigger statutory reporting obligations.9 23 24 Further, restrictive networks are commonly associated with these acquisitions. For instance, 25 patients receiving care from a physician employed by a hospital or large corporation may only 26 receive referrals to other clinicians employed by said hospital or corporation. This can lead to less 27 patient choice and arbitrary removal from networks of independent physicians. 10 As these large 28 corporations continue their entry into the health care market, this can result in more harm than good 29 if the voices of patients and community- based private practice physicians are not integrated into 30 their plans. 31 32 The Role of Large Corporations in Health C are: Recent Examples 33 34 Amazon 35 36 Amazon's en try into hea lth care predomina ntly consists of health care services, such as in -person 37 care, telehealth , and pharmaceuticals. For example, the company launched a telehealth service, 38 Amazon Care, after first piloting it to its employees.3 Designed to address high employee health 39 care costs, the app- based platform partnered with One Medical to offer members in -person and 40 virtual primary, urgent, and preventive care services, including COVID-19 and flu testing, 41 vaccinations, and treatment for illnesses and injuries.3,11 One Medical places medical offices near 42 the workplace, and its members use an app to book app ointments and track health records.12 The 43 platform reported a membership of 790,000 customers at the end of June 2022.13 In June 2022, 44 Ama zon announced its intent to purchase OneMedical for $3.9 billion.14,15 After an eight month 45 review, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) declined to challenge the acquisition and the deal 46 was finalized on February 22, 2023.12,16 47 B of T Rep. 14 -A-23 - Page 3 of 15 CVS 1 2 Perhaps the most established in health care of the mentioned corporations, CVS , is focused on 3 journeying further into primary care.4,5 The company has offered walk -in health care services since 4 the early 2000s. Today, consumers may take advantage of routine physicals, screenings, 5 vaccinations, treatment for illnesses and minor injuries, mental health counseling and services that 6 address social determinants of health , such as wellness and health education classes, tobacco 7 cessation support and sleep assessments.4 In addition to the company's 10,000 pharmacy locations, 8 CVS recently amassed a 10,000- clinician -network that makes in -person and virtual home visits 9 through its Signify Hea lth acquisition.6 10 11 A key part of its strategy to deliver on its goal, announced in 2021, to facilitate 65 billion health 12 care interactions over the next decade, is to transform the number of stores converted to the 13 HealthHUB model. With over 20 percent of the store dedicated to these HealthHUBs, this concept 14 is designed to provide patients with chronic disease management consultations and other health and 15 wellness services such as sleep apnea assessments and blood draws . Further, the concept will offer 16 an array of durable medical equipment and other medical supplies17. As the HealthH UBs are 17 currently staffed by nurse practitioners, CVS aims to hire physicians to staff the primary care sites. 18 In addition to offering convenience to customers, the company also believes these efforts will 19 reduce health care costs.5 20 21 Most recently, CVS acqui red Oak Street Health for $10.6 billion. Oak Street's centers 22 predominantly serve low - to middle -income patients aged 65 and older with Medicare Advantage 23 plans. The company operates in 169 locations throughout 21 states , and its locations are expected 24 to increase to 300 by 2026.18 25 26 Walmart 27 28 Walmart continues to disrupt the health care industry through low -cost health care services and 29 insurance.19 The company opened comprehensive health clinics in 2019 that offer affordable 30 services such as primary care, urgent care, dental care, mental health counseling , and vision and 31 hearing services.5 In addition to the 20 clinic locations that the company curr ently operates in 32 Georgia, Walmart has over 5,000 pharmacy locations and aims to expand to Florida in 2023.11,12 33 Walmart now also offers virtual care through its telehealth platform, MeMD , and recently procured 34 an agreement with UnitedHealth Group, the wor ld's largest insurer.5,6 Through this partnership, 35 Walmart and UnitedHealth Group will offer a Medicare Advantage plan. UnitedHealth Group will 36 provide data analytics and decision support tools to Walmart clinicians, and Walmart Health's 37 virtual care services will be included as part of one of UnitedHealth's commercial PPO plans.4 38 39 Walgreens 40 41 Walgreens is also focused on offering health care services, as demonstrated by its recent launch of 42 Walgreens Health. The company currently owns 70 VillageMD primary care clinics. Walgreens 43 continues to provide in- store services such as health tests, screenings and help with medications. 44 The comp any also created an online marketplace where users may schedule appointments.5 45 46 Elevance Health 47 48 Elevance Health, formerly Anthem , combines care del ivery tools and technology in its Carelon 49 Division with its health insurance companies , with aspirations of growing beyond providing he alth 50 insurance to become a \"lifetim e partner\" in the delivery of health care to its members. 20 Unique 51 B of T Rep. 14 -A-23 - Page 4 of 15 among other insura nce companie s that have purchased physic ian practices as part of their del ivery 1 network, Elevance is investing in an \"Aggrega tor Strategy .\" Through this strategy, Carelon , with 2 other thi rd-party partners, provide s infrastructure and data analytics to independent primary care 3 physician practices to enabl e them to effectively participate in value -based contracts so they can 4 remain independent in local communit ies.20,21 5 6 UnitedHealth Group 7 8 UnitedHealth Group is an example of a large vertically -integrated health care corporation that 9 comprises a health in surance company, UnitedHealthcare, a solutions service , Optum , and a 10 provider group subsidiary, Optum Health . Optum Health owns physician practices inclusive of 11 approximately 60,000 physicians who treat over 20 million patients annually. Much of this growth 12 is derived from the group's focus on value -based care. Optum's CEO, Andrew Witty, expects that 13 the company will have four million pati ents in accountable care arrangements in 2023.21 The 14 company plans to continue its expansion of value- based services\u2014 Witty in formed investors that 15 Optum Health intends to integrate further behavioral and home health offerings into its health care 16 strategy.23 17 18 Dollar General 19 20 In January 2023, Dollar General announced a partnership with DocGo, a publicly traded company 21 that offers \"last -mile care\" via mobile health care clinics with trained providers, a transportation 22 and logistics network , and an advanced data analytics network to deliver quick and easy health 23 visits outside Dollar Genera l stores. DocGo onsite care is provided by certified medical assistants, 24 emergency medical technicians, licensed practical nurses, paramedics and physicians via remote 25 technology. Services offered at Dollar General locations will include preventive visits and chronic 26 care management. Dollar General, with over 18,000 stores nationwide\u2014many in underserved rural 27 and urban areas\u2014seeks to make health care more accessible and convenient for its shoppers. 24 28 29 Others 30 31 Other companies, including National Public Radio (NPR), CHG Healthcare Services, USAA, 32 Goldman Sachs, CustomInk, Anthrex, JM Family Enterprises and Quik Trip, have begun providing 33 their employees with on -site health care services. NPR's and CHG's health clinics are available at 34 no cost to all employees regardless of their enrollment status within the companies' health plans. 35 USAA offers its employees cancer screenings, flu shots, blood pressure checks, massages and 36 physical rehabilitation. Goldman Sachs' and QuikTrip's health care benefits are available to all 37 enrolled employees and their families. Further, many physicians employed by QuikTrip work 38 exclusively for the company.25 39 40 Investments and Support of Private Practices 41 42 Also accelerating is p rivate sector investment in small- to medium -sized physician practices for the 43 purpose of providing infrastructure to transition to value -based models . There has been significant 44 growth in compani es specif ically designed to help independent prac tices succeed in value -based 45 models, including Al edade, Emergence Healthcare Group , Redesign Health and Privia . 46 Representing a shift from the 2010s, wherein founders of venture capital -backed health tech mainly 47 pursued large pay ers and employers, as well as hospitals, there has been recent interest in selling to 48 small- to medium -sized businesses which include private practices. Owners of private practices are 49 increasingly seeking to remain independent, and these opportunities prov ide the m with the agency 50 B of T Rep. 14 -A-23 - Page 5 of 15 and revenue to do so.26 Private equity firms see significant opportunit ies in investing in physician 1 practices across specialties to offer administrative support .27 2 3 AMA Market Analysis 4 5 The AMA conducted confidential informational interviews to better understand the evolving 6 market landscape and identify opportunities to create pilo t programs to advance the advocacy of 7 private practice and small business medicine within the rapidly growing area of health care 8 delivery within Fortune 500 corporations in America . 9 10 To better understand the best method to explore the creat ion of potential pilots , the AMA: ( 1) 11 conducted (1) a market landscape assessment based on publicly available news articles and studies; 12 and ( 2) qualitative informational interviews among a sample of national corporate entities. The 13 confidential informational interviews were conducted between Fall 2022 and Winter 2023 with 14 individuals directly responsible for each organization's strategy in health care delivery. The 15 interviews were conducted with a series of pre -determined questions regarding corporate entities' 16 approaches and strategic thinking on health care delivery and the role of private practices in the 17 communit y. Interviews included a selection of large national insurers vertical ly integrati ng into the 18 delivery of care through acquisitions, along with national retailers and large technology companies 19 entering the health care delivery marketplace . 20 21 Three key themes emerged from this market a nalysis : 22 23 1. Corporate entities are increasingly investing in opportunities in care delivery and believe 24 this strategy will increase value for their insured employees, their customers and 25 shareholders. 26 2. Corporations believe \"value- based\" payment and delivery models will drive better patient 27 outcomes and lower health care costs and are investing heavily in these models. 28 3. While acquisition of independent practices is accelerating in certain markets, some 29 corporate entities, particularly among vertically integrated health i nsurers, have a strategy 30 of working with independent practices in communities. These companies express a goal of 31 supporting integrated networks of practices, with the aim of providing more enhanced, 32 coordinated care for patients and preventing practice acq uisition by larger health care 33 systems or hospitals that can lead to consolidation and attendant price increases. Newer 34 corporate retail and technology entrants will continue experimenting with various 35 arrangements subject to market conditions and sharehol der priorities. 36 37 AMA POLICY 38 39 The AMA supports preserving the value of the private practice of medicine and its benefit to 40 patients. AMA will: 41 42 a. Utilize its resources to protect and support the continued existence of solo and small group 43 medical practice and to protect and support the ability of these practices to provide quality 44 care. They will also advocate in Congress to ensure adequate payment for services 45 rendered by private practicing physicians . 46 b. Work through the appropriate channels to preserve choices and opportunities, including the 47 private practice of medicine, for new physicians whose choices and opportunities may be 48 limited due to their significant medical education debt. The organization will work through 49 the appropriat e channels to ensure that medical students and residents during their training 50 are educated in all of medicine's career choices, including the private practice of medicine . 51 B of T Rep. 14 -A-23 - Page 6 of 15 c. Create, maintain and make accessible to medical students, residents and fellows, and 1 physicians resources to enhance satisfaction and practice sustainability for physicians in 2 private practice . 3 d. Create and maintain a reference document establishing principles for entering into and 4 sustaining a private practice, and encourage medical schoo ls and residency programs to 5 present physicians in training with information regarding private practice as a viable 6 option. 7 e. Issue a report in collaboration with the Private Practice Physicians Section at least every 8 two years communicating their efforts to support independent medical practices (Policy D - 9 405.988, \"The Preservation of the P rivate P ractice of Medicine\" ). 10 11 The AMA also supports the consideration of prospective payment elements in the development of 12 payment and delivery reform that are consistent with AMA principles, as well as the following 13 principles to support physicians who choose to participate in prospective payment models: 14 a. The AMA, state medical associations and national medical specialty societies should be 15 encouraged to continue to provide guidance and support infrastructure that allows 16 independent physicians to join with other physicians in clinically integrated networks, 17 independent of any hospital system. 18 b. Prospective payment model compensation should incentivize specialty and primary care 19 collegiality among independently practicing physicians. 20 c. Prospective payment models should take into consideration clinical data, where 21 appropriate, in addition to claims data. 22 d. Governance within the model must be physician- led and autonomous . 23 e. Physician practices should be encouraged to work with field advisors on patient 24 attributions and a balanced mix of payers. 25 f. Quality metrics used in the model should be clinically meaningful and developed with 26 physician input. 27 g. Administrative burdens, su ch as those related to prior authorization, should be reduced for 28 participating physicians (Policy H -385.904, \"Prospective Payment Model Best Practices 29 for Independent Private Practice\") . 30 31 The AMA will identify financially viable prospective payment models and develop educational 32 opportunities for physicians to learn and collaborate on best practices for such payment models for 33 physician practice , including but not limited to independent private practice (Policy H -385.904, 34 \"Prospective Payment Model Best Practices for Independent Private Practice\" ). 35 36 Additionally, t he AMA supports flexibility in the design and implementation of value -based 37 insurance design (VBID) programs, consistent with the following principles: 38 a. Value r eflects the clinical be nefit gained relative to the money spent. VBID explicitly considers 39 the clinical benefit of a given service or treatment when determining cost -sharing structures or 40 other benefit design elements. 41 b. Practicing physicians must be actively involved in the development of VBID programs. VBID 42 program design related to specific medical/surgical conditions must involve appropriate 43 specialists. 44 c. High -quality, evidence -based data must be used to support the development of any targeted 45 benefit design. Treatments or services for which there is insufficient or inconclusive evidence 46 about their clinical value should not be included in any targeted benefit design elements of a 47 health plan. 48 d. The methodology and criteria used to determine high- or low -value services or treatments must 49 be transparent and easily accessible to physicians and patients. 50 B of T Rep. 14 -A-23 - Page 7 of 15 e. Coverage and cost -sharing policies must be transparent and easily accessible to physicians and 1 patients. Educational materials should be made available to help patients and physic ians 2 understand the incentives and disincentives built into the plan design. 3 f. VBID should not restrict access to patient care. Designs can use incentives and disincentives to 4 target specific services or treatments but should not otherwise limit patient care choices. 5 g. Physicians retain the ultimate responsibility for directing the care of their patients. Plan designs 6 that include higher cost- sharing or other disincentives to obtaining services designated as low - 7 value must include an appeals process to enable patients to secure care recommended by their 8 physicians, without incurring cost -sharing penalties. 9 h. Plan sponsors should ensure adequate resource capabilities to ensure effective implementation 10 and ongoing evaluation of the plan designs they choose. Procedures must be in place to ensure 11 VBID coverage rules are updated in accordance with evolving evidence. 12 i. VBID programs must be consistent with AMA Pay for Performance Principles and Guidelines 13 (Policy H -450.947), and AMA policy on physician economic profiling and tiered, narrow or 14 restricted networks (Policies H -450.941 and D -285.972) (Policy H -185.939, \"Value -Based 15 Insurance Design\" ). 16 17 The AMA will also study and clarify the ethical challenges and considerations regarding physician 18 professionalism raise d by the advent and expansion of private equity ownership or management of 19 physician practices and report back on the status of any ethical dimensions inherent in these 20 arrangements, including consideration of the need for ethical guidelines as appropriate . Such a 21 study should evaluate the impact of private equity ownership, including but not limited to the effect 22 on the professional responsibilities and ethical priorities for physician practices (Policy D -140.951, 23 \"Establishing Ethical Principles for Physi cians Involved in Private Equity Owned Practices\") . 24 25 Moreover, the AMA encourages physicians who are contemplating corporate investor partnerships 26 to consider the following guidelines: 27 a. Physicians should consider how the practice's current mission, vision and long- term goals 28 align with those of the corporate investor. 29 b. Due diligence should be conducted that includes, at minimum, review of the corporate 30 investor's business model, strategic plan, leadership and governance and culture. 31 c. External legal, ac counting and/or business counsels should be obtained to advise during the 32 exploration and negotiation of corporate investor transactions. 33 d. Retaining negotiators to advocate for best interests of the practice and its employees should 34 be considered. 35 e. Physicians should consider whether and how corporate investor partnerships may require 36 physicians to cede varying degrees of control over practice decision -making and day- to- 37 day management. 38 f. Physicians should consider the potential impact of corporate investor partn erships on 39 physician and practice employee satisfaction and future physician recruitment. 40 g. Physicians should have a clear understanding of compensation agreements, mechanisms 41 for conflict resolution, processes for exiting corporate investor partnerships, and 42 application of restrictive covenants. 43 h. Physicians should consider corporate investor processes for medical staff representation on 44 the board of directors and medical staff leadership selection. 45 i. Physicians should retain responsibility for clinical governance, patient welfare and 46 outcomes, physician clinical autonomy and physician due process under corporate investor 47 partnerships. 48 j. Each individual physician should have the ultimate decision for medical judgment in 49 patient care and medical care processes, incl uding supervision of non- physician 50 practitioners. 51 B of T Rep. 14 -A-23 - Page 8 of 15 k. Physicians should retain primary and final responsibility for structured medical education 1 inclusive of undergraduate medical education including the structure of the program, 2 program curriculum, selection of faculty and trainees, as well as education and disciplinary 3 issues related to these programs (Policy H -160.891, \"Corporate Investors\") . 4 5 Further, t he AMA supports improved transparency regarding corporate investment in physician 6 practices and subsequent changes in health care prices , encourages national medical specialty 7 societies to research and develop tools and resources on the impact of corporate invest or 8 partnerships on patients and the physicians in practicing in that specialt y and supports 9 consideration of options for gathering information on the impact of private equity and corporate 10 investors on the practice of medicine (Policy H -160.891, \"Corporate Investors\"). 11 12 Additionally, AMA policy states that any individual, company, or other entity that establishes 13 and/or operates worksite health clinics should adhere to the following principles: 14 a. Worksite health clinics must hav e a well -defined scope of clinical services, consistent with 15 state scope of practice laws. 16 b. Worksite health clinics must establish a referral system with physician practices or other 17 facilities for appropriate treatment if the patient's conditions or sympto ms are beyond the 18 scope of services provided by the clinic. 19 c. Worksite health clinics that use nurse practitioners and other health professionals to deliver 20 care must establish arrangements by which their health care practitioners have direct access 21 to MD/DO s, as consistent with state laws. 22 d. Worksite health clinics must clearly inform patients in advance of the qualifications of the 23 health care practitioners who are providing care, as well as the limitation in the types of 24 illnesses that can be diagnosed and t reated. 25 e. Worksite health clinics should develop expertise in specific occupational hazards and 26 medical conditions that are likely to be more common in the particular industry where the 27 company offers products and services. 28 f. Worksite health clinics must use evidence -based practice guidelines to ensure patient 29 safety and quality of care. 30 g. Worksite health clinics must measure clinical quality provided to patients and participate in 31 quality improvement efforts in order to demonstrate improvement in their system of care. 32 h. Worksite health clinics must adopt explicit and public policies to assure the security and 33 confidentiality of patients' medical information. Such policies must bar employers from 34 unconsented access to identifiable medical information so that knowled ge of sensitive facts 35 cannot be used against individuals. 36 i. Worksite health clinics must establish protocols for ensuring continuity of care with 37 practicing physicians within the local community. Such protocols must ensure after -hours 38 access of employees and eligible family members, as well as the transmission of reports of 39 all worksite clinic visits and treatments to the physicians of patients with an identified 40 community physician. 41 j. Worksite health clinics administering immunizations must establish processes to ensure 42 communication to the patient's medical home and the state immunization registry 43 documenting what immunizations have been given. 44 k. Patient cost -sharing for treatment received outside of the clinic must be affordable and not 45 prohibit necessary access to care. 46 l. Worksite health clinics should allow the involvement of community physicians in clinic 47 operations. 48 m. Employers implementing worksite health clinics should communicate the eligibility for 49 services of employees' family members. 50 B of T Rep. 14 -A-23 - Page 9 of 15 n. Worksite health clini cs should be encouraged to use interoperable electronic health records 1 as a means of communicating patient information to and facilitating continuity of care with 2 community physicians, hospitals and other health care facilities (Policy H -160.910, 3 \"Worksite Health Clinics\") . 4 5 The AMA also acknowledges that the corporate practice of medicine: (1) has the potential to erode 6 the patient -physician relationship; and (2) may create a conflict of interest between profit and best 7 practices in residency and fellowship training (Policy H -160.887, \" Corporate Practice of 8 Medicine\" ). 9 10 Furthermore , (1) the AMA vigorously opposes any effort to pass federal legislation preempting 11 state laws prohibiting the corporate practice of medicine; (2) At the request of state medical 12 associations, the AMA will provide guidance, consultation, and model legislation regarding the 13 corporate practice of medicine, to ensure the autonomy of hospital medical staffs, employed 14 physicians in non- hospital settings and physicians contracting with corporately- owned management 15 service organizations; and (3) the AMA will continue to monitor the evolving corporate practice of 16 medicine with respect to its effect on the patient -physician relationship, financial conflicts of 17 interest, patient -centered care and other relevant issues (Policy H -215.981, \" Corporate Practice of 18 Medicine\"). 19 20 DISCUS SION 21 22 Opportunities for Corporation- Provided Health C are 23 24 Large corporations , equipped with large amounts of capital, massive active user bases, and data and 25 technology capabilities , have the potential to offer greater options for how patients receive care and 26 streamline and automate processes to potentially alleviate high costs, burnout and inefficiencies. 27 28 Additionally, large corporations, which collect and maintain significant amounts of customer data, 29 claim to utilize this data to address social determinants of health. For example, Dollar General and 30 Walmart plan to expand access to care in rural communities, and Walmart is p rioritizing diversity 31 in clinical trials, as 20 percent of drugs reportedly respond differently across ethnic groups.5,18 32 33 Further , new ven ture ca pital-backed co mpanies , of which many are physician -led, are specifically 34 designed to provide opportunitie s to improve the car e delivery and financial sustainab ility of 35 underinve sted-in smal l to medium -independent physician practice s. 36 37 Challenges for Corporation- Provided Health Care 38 39 Trust and a lack of health care background remain significant barriers to success for large 40 corporations , particularly Big Tech companies such as Apple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon. For 41 example, consumers, regulators and privacy advocates have all raised concerns about the 42 implications of Big Tech having access to patient's health records, as well as a potential 43 cybersecurity crisis. 5,12, This concern has only further intensified following the overturning of Roe 44 v. Wade , which sparked questions about the use of personal data to surveil people seeking 45 reproductive health services.12 46 47 Others have pointed to the underperformance of large corporations' investments in health care. For 48 instance, Haven, an effort by Amazon, JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway that sought to 49 reduce hea lth care costs and improve patient outcomes, failed after just two years. Additionally, 50 margins in health care are small . As large corporations are used to high margins and rapidly scaled 51 B of T Rep. 14 -A-23 - Page 10 of 1 5 businesses, some experts question their preparedness for the health care industry where profit 1 margins are typically small.28 2 3 Further , common adverse effects of mergers and acquisitions on physicians include workflow 4 disruptions, organizational changes that may increase workloads and staff burden, technological 5 transitions such as shifts in EHR implementation and even lower wages. A thenahealth's 2021 6 Physician Sentiment Index report demonstrated that physicia ns undergoing a merger or acquisition 7 expressed less willingness to remain at their organization and were more likely to experience 8 burnout. While 68 percent of physician respondents undergoing a merger or acquisition reported 9 that they would recommend the ir health care organization to friends or family, 85 percent of 10 physicians not undergoing a merger or acquisition reported that they would recommend their 11 organization to loved ones. The National Institute for Health Care ( NIHCM ) Foundation found that 12 after a hospital merger, skilled workers experienced a four percent decrease in wages, and nurses 13 and pharmacy workers saw a 6.8 percent decrease.29 14 15 Finally , value -based payment models ha ve pers istent and ongoing meth odologic and 16 implementatio n challenges for payers, large integrated health care systems and indep endent private 17 practices alike , including d esigning adequa te risk models, measu ring quality, providing access t o 18 timely and actionable data , and i mposing signi ficant administrative burdens . These fu ndamental 19 desig n and implementation challen ges must be addres sed to ensure sustainab le success for an y of 20 these inve stments .30,31. 21 22 CONCLUSION 23 24 With the conti nued growth of corporate entrants in care delivery pursuing new practice ownership 25 strategies and delivery models , particularly am ong small -to-medium -sized physi cian pract ices, this 26 report highlights opportunities for the AMA to work directly with corporate entities to advocate for 27 and support independent physician practices in communi ties. Health care cost s continue to 28 increase, and the quality of and access to care continue s to erode in many local co mmunities . Thus, 29 we support corporate entities to work with and assist independent physician practice s with the 30 capabilities to deliver h ighly coordinated care that is cri tical to improving patient outcomes and 31 competition in man y markets. 32 33 RECOMMENDATIONS 34 35 The Board of Trustees recommends that the following be adopted and the remainder of the report 36 be filed : 37 38 1. That our American Medical Association (AMA) reaffirm the following policies: 39 a. D-405.988, \" The Preservation of the Private Practice of Medicine \" 40 b. H-385.904, \" Prospective Payment Model Best Practices for Independent Private 41 Practice \" 42 c. H-185.939, \" Value -Based Insurance Design \" 43 d. D-140.951, \" Establishing Ethical Principles for Physicians Involved in Private 44 Equity Owned Practices\" 45 e. H-160.891, \"Corporate Investors\" ; (Reaffirm HOD Policy) and 46 47 2. That our AMA will: (1) inform corporate efforts about the value of private practices to 48 successfully participate in new \"value -based\" models ; (2) identify and work with a 49 corporate entit y that is advancing these models to explore a two year pilot amo ng 50 independent private practices in which the AMA will : (a) convene physic ian practices in a 51 B of T Rep. 14 -A-23 - Page 11 of 1 5 community; (b) provide educat ional resources and technical assistance to practices to 1 suppor t their participation with the corpo rate enti ty and (c) forma lly evaluate the pilot for 2 outcomes ; and (3) advocate with commercial payers and health plans and federal and state 3 payers and policymakers to support private practice through policies and models that 4 provide adequate payment, infrastructure and data to succeed in \"value- based \" models. 5 (Directive to Take Action) 6 3. That Policy D -160.912 be rescinded as having been accomplished by this report. (Rescind 7 HOD Policy) 8 Fiscal Note: $274,962 REFERENCES 1. Smith A, Wattles J.

REPORT OF THE COUNCIL ON MEDICAL SERVICE CMS Report 01- A-23 Subject: Council on Medical Service Sunset Review of 201 3 House Policies Presented by: Lynn Jeffers , MD, Chair Referred to: Reference Committee G Policy G -600.110, \"Sunset Mechanism for AMA Policy,\" calls for the decennial review of 1 American Medical Association (AMA) policies to ensure that our AMA's policy database is 2 current, coherent, and relevant. Policy G -600.110 reads as follows : 3 4 1. As the Ho use of Delegates adopts policies, a maximum ten -year time horizon shall exist. A 5 policy will typically sunset after ten years unless action is taken by the House of Delegates 6 to retain it. Any action of our AMA House that reaffirms or amends an existing policy 7 position shall reset the sunset \"clock,\" making the reaffirmed or amended policy viable for 8 another ten years. 9 10 2. In the implementation and ongoing operation of our AMA policy sunset mechanism, the 11 following procedures shall be followed: (a) Each yea r, the Speakers shall provide a list of 12 policies that are subject to review under the policy sunset mechanism; (b) Such policies 13 shall be assigned to the appropriate AMA councils for review; (c) Each AMA council that 14 has been asked to review policies shall develop and submit a report to the House of 15 Delegates identifying policies that are scheduled to sunset; (d) For each policy under 16 review, the reviewing council can recommend one of the following actions: (i) retain the 17 policy; (ii) sunset the policy; (ii i) retain part of the policy; or (iv) reconcile the policy with 18 more recent and like policy; (e) For each recommendation that it makes to retain a policy in 19 any fashion, the reviewing council shall provide a succinct, but cogent justification (f) The 20 Speak ers shall determine the best way for the House of Delegates to handle the sunset 21 reports. 22 23 3. Nothing in this policy shall prohibit a report to the HOD or resolution to sunset a policy 24 earlier than its 10 -year horizon if it is no longer relevant, has been superseded by a more 25 current policy, or has been accomplished. 26 27 4. The AMA councils and the House of Delegates should conform to the following guidelines 28 for sunset: (a) when a policy is no longer relevant or necessary; (b) when a policy or 29 directive has b een accomplished; or (c) when the policy or directive is part of an 30 established AMA practice that is transparent to the House and codified elsewhere such as 31 the AMA Bylaws or the AMA House of Delegates Reference Manual: Procedures, Policies 32 and Practices. 33 34 5. The most recent policy shall be deemed to supersede contradictory past AMA policies. 35 36 6. Sunset policies will be retained in the AMA historical archives. 37 CMS Rep. 01- A-23 -- page 2 of 82 RECOMMENDATION 1 2 The Council on Medical Service recommends that the House of Delegates policies that are 3 listed in the appendix to this report be acted upon in the manner indicated and the 4 remainder of this report be filed. 5 CMS Rep. 01-A-23 -- page 3 of 82 APPENDIX - Recommended Actions POLICY # Title Text Recommendation D-130.965 On-Call Coverage Models Our AMA will compile and make available to the physician community various examples of on- call solutions intended to avoid subjecting physicians to unrealistic and unduly burdensome on -call demands and educate AMA physician members regarding these options. Retain. Still relevant. D-160.934 Physician Participation in Multiple Medicare Accountable Care Organizations Our AMA will continue to work with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to address accountable care organization (ACO) rules that preclude physician participation in multiple Medicare ACOs. Retain. Still relevant . D-165.939 Transitional Reinsurance Fees Under the Affordable Care Act Our AMA will advocate that any proposed assessment on \"issuers of insurance \" (scheduled to commence in 2014 for a 3- year period), intended to fund a \" risk adjustment program \" to cushion insurers against any actual uncertainties surrounding the health status of the uninsured, be taken from administrative and medical management costs. Retain -in-part. All is still relevant other than \"(scheduled to commence in 2014 for a 3-year period) ,\" which should be removed. D-165.955 Status Report on Expanding Health Care Coverage to all Individuals, with an Emphasis on the Uninsured 1. Our AMA will continue to: (1) place a high priority on expanding health insurance coverage for all; (2) pursue bipartisan support for individually selected and owned health insurance through the use of adequately funded federal tax credits as a preferred long- term solution for covering all; and (3) explore and support alternative means of ensuring health care coverage for all. 2.

Superseded by Policies H-165.920 , H-165.865, D-290.979 Insurance H-165.920 Our AMA: (1) affirms its support for pluralism of health care delivery systems and financing mechanisms in obtaining universal coverage and access to health care services; (2) reco gnizes incremental levels of coverage for different groups of the uninsured, consistent with finite resources, as a necessary CMS Rep. 01- A-23 -- page 4 of 82 POLICY # Title Text Recommendation they should desire, in developing and evaluating a pilot project(s) utilizing AMA policy as a means of dealing with the impending public health crisis of displaced Medicaid enrollees and uninsured individuals as a result of the recent natural disasters in that region. interim step toward universal access; (3) actively supports the principle of the individual 's right to select his/her health insur ance plan and actively support ways in which the concept of individually selected and individually owned health insurance can be appropriately integrated, in a complementary position, into the Association 's position on achieving universal coverage and access to health care services. To do this, our AMA will: (a) Continue to support equal tax treatment for payment of health insurance coverage whether the employer provides the coverage for the employee or whether the employer provides a financial contribution to the employee to purchase individually selected and individually owned health insurance coverage, including the exemption of both employer and employee contributions toward the individually owned insurance from FICA (Social Security and Medicare) and federal and state unemployment taxes; (b) Support the concept that the tax treatment would be the same as long as the employer 's contribution toward the cost of the employee 's health insurance is at least equivalent to the same dollar amount that the employe r would pay when purchasing the employee 's insurance directly; (c) Study the viability of provisions that would allow individual employees to opt out of group plans without jeopardizing the ability of the group to continue their employer sponsored group coverage; and (d) Work toward establishment of safeguards, such as a health CMS Rep. 01- A-23 -- page 5 of 82 POLICY # Title Text Recommendation care voucher system, to ensure that to the extent that employer direct contributions made to the employee for the purchase of individually selected and individually owned health insurance coverage continue, such contributions are used only for that purpose when the employer direct contributions are less than the cost of the specified minimum level of coverage. Any excess of the direct contribution over the cost of such coverage could be used by the individual for other purposes; (4) will identify any further means through which universal coverage and access can be achieved; (5) supports individually selected and individually - owned health insurance as the preferred method for people to obtain health insurance coverage; and supports and advocates a system where individually -purchased and owned health insurance coverage is the preferred option, but employer -provided coverage is still available to the extent the market demands it; (6) supports the individual's right to select his/her health insurance plan and to receive the same tax treatment for individually purchased coverage, for contributions toward employer -provided coverage, and for completely employer provided coverage; (7) supports i mmediate tax equity for health insurance costs of self -employed and unemployed persons; (8) supports legislation to remove paragraph (4) of Section 162(l) of the US tax code, which discriminates against the self -employed by requiring them to pay federal payroll (FICA) tax on health CMS Rep. 01- A-23 -- page 6 of 82 POLICY # Title Text Recommendation insurance premium expenditures; (9) supports legislation requiring a \" maintenance of effort \" period, such as one or two years, during which employers would be required to add to the employee 's salary the cash value of any health insurance coverage they directly provide if they discontinue that coverage or if the employee opts out of the employer -provided plan; (10) encourages through all appropriate channels the development of educational programs to assist consumers in making inf ormed choices as to sources of individual health insurance coverage; (11) encourages employers, unions, and other employee groups to consider the merits of risk -adjusting the amount of the employer direct contributions toward individually purchased coverag e. Under such an approach, useful risk adjustment measures such as age, sex, and family status would be used to provide higher -risk employees with a larger contribution and lower - risk employees with a lesser one; (12) supports a replacement of the present federal income tax exclusion from employees ' taxable income of employer - provided health insurance coverage with tax credits for individuals and families, while allowing all health insurance expenditures to be exempt from federal and state payroll taxes, in cluding FICA (Social Security and Medicare) payroll tax, FUTA (federal unemployment tax act) payroll tax, and SUTA (state unemployment tax act) payroll tax; CMS Rep. 01- A-23 -- page 7 of 82 POLICY # Title Text Recommendation (13) advocates that, upon replacement, with tax credits, of the exclusion of employer - sponsored hea lth insurance from employees' federal income tax, any states and municipalities conforming to this federal tax change be required to use the resulting increase in state and local tax revenues to finance health insurance tax credits, vouchers or other cover age subsidies; and (14) believes that refundable, advanceable tax credits inversely related to income are preferred over public sector expansions as a means of providing coverage to the uninsured. (15) Our AMA reaffirms our policies committed to our patien ts and their individual responsibility and freedoms consistent with our United States Constitution. Medicaid Expansion D-290.979 Our AMA, at the invitation of state medical societies, will work with state and specialty medical societies in advocating at the state level to expand Medicaid eligibility to 133 percent (138 percent FPL including the income disregard) of the Federal Poverty Level as authorized by the ACA and will advocate for an increase in Medicaid payments to physicians and impr ovements and innovations in Medicaid that will reduce administrative burdens and deliver healthcare services more effectively, even as coverage is expanded. 2. Our AMA will: (a) continue to advocate strongly for expansion of the Medicaid program to all sta tes and reaffirm existing policies D-290.979, H 290.965 and CMS Rep. 01- A-23 -- page 8 of 82 POLICY # Title Text Recommendation H-165.823; and (b) work with interested state medical associations and national medical specialty societies to provide AMA resources on Medicaid expansion and covering the uninsured to health care professionals to inform the public of the importance of expanded health insurance coverage to all. Principles for Structuring a Health Insurance Tax Credit H-165.865 (1) AMA support for replacement of the present exclusion from employees' taxable income of employer - provided health insurance coverage with tax credits will be guided by the following principles: (a) Tax credits should be contingent on the purchase of health insurance, so that if insurance is not purchased the credit is not provide d. (b) Tax credits should be refundable. (c) The size of tax credits should be inversely related to income. (d) The size of tax credits should be large enough to ensure that health insurance is affordable for most people. (e) The size of tax credits should be capped in any given year. (f) Tax credits should be fixed- dollar amounts for a given income and family structure. (g) The size of tax credits should vary with family size to mirror the pricing structure of insurance premiums. (h) Tax credits for families should be contingent on each member of the family having health insurance. (i)Tax credits should be applicable only for the purchase of health insurance, including all components of a qualified Health Savings Account, and not for out -of-pocket health expenditures. (j) Tax credits should be advanceable for low - CMS Rep. 01- A-23 -- page 9 of 82 POLICY # Title Text Recommendation income persons who could not afford the monthly out -of- pocket premium costs. (2) It is the policy of our AMA that in order to qualify for a tax credit for the purchase of individual health insuranc e, the health insurance purchased must provide coverage for hospital care, surgical and medical care, and catastrophic coverage of medical expenses as defined by Title 26 Section 9832 of the United States Code. (3) Our AMA will support the use of tax credi ts, vouchers, premium subsidies or direct dollar subsidies, when designed in a manner consistent with AMA principles for structuring tax credits and when designed to enable individuals to purchase individually owned health insurance. Options to Maximize Coverage under the AMA Proposal for Reform H-165.823 That our AMA advocate for a pluralistic health care system, which may include a public option, that focuses on increasing equity and access, is cost-conscious, and reduces burden on physicians. 2. Our AMA will advocate that any public option to expand health insurance coverage must meet the following standards: a. The primary goals of establishing a public option are to maximize patient choice of health plan and maximize health plan marketplace competi tion. b. Eligibility for premium tax credit and cost -sharing assistance to purchase the public option is restricted to individuals without access to affordable employer -sponsored CMS Rep. 01- A-23 -- page 10 of 82 POLICY # Title Text Recommendation coverage that meets standards for minimum value of benefits. c. Physician p ayments under the public option are established through meaningful negotiations and contracts. Physician payments under the public option must be higher than prevailing Medicare rates and at rates sufficient to sustain the costs of medical practice. d. Ph ysicians have the freedom to choose whether to participate in the public option. Public option proposals should not require provider participation and/or tie physician participation in Medicare, Medicaid and/or any commercial product to participation in th e public option. e. The public option is financially self -sustaining and has uniform solvency requirements. f. The public option does not receive advantageous government subsidies in comparison to those provided to other health plans. g. The public opti on shall be made available to uninsured individuals who fall into the \"coverage gap\" in states that do not expand Medicaid - having incomes above Medicaid eligibility limits but below the federal poverty level, which is the lower limit for premium tax cred its - at no or nominal cost. 3. Our AMA supports states and/or the federal government pursuing auto- enrollment in health insurance coverage that meets the following standards: a. Individuals must provide consent to the applicable state and/or federal ent ities to share their health insurance status and tax data with the entity with the authority to make coverage determinations. CMS Rep. 01- A-23 -- page 11 of 82 POLICY # Title Text Recommendation b. Individuals should only be auto-enrolled in health insurance coverage if they are eligible for coverage options that would be of no cost to them after the application of any subsidies. Candidates for auto-enrollment would, therefore, include individuals eligible for Medicaid/Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) or zero-premium marketplace coverage. c. Individuals should ha ve the opportunity to opt out from health insurance coverage into which they are auto- enrolled. d. Individuals should not be penalized if they are auto - enrolled into coverage for which they are not eligible or remain uninsured despite believing they were enrolled in health insurance coverage via auto-enrollment. e. Individuals eligible for zero-premium marketplace coverage should be randomly assigned among the zero - premium plans with the highest actuarial values. f. Health plans should be incentivized to offer pre - deductible coverage including physician services in their bronze and silver plans, to maximize the value of zero - premium plans to plan enrollees. g. Individuals enrolled in a zero-premium bronze plan who are eligible for cost -sharing reductions should be notified of the cost -sharing advantages of enrolling in silver plans. h. There should be targeted outreach and streamlined enrollment mechanisms promoting health insurance enrollment, which could include raising awareness of the availability of premium tax credits and cost -sharing reductions, and establishing a CMS Rep. 01- A-23 -- page 12 of 82 POLICY # Title Text Recommendation special enrollment period. 4. Our AMA: (a) will advocate that any federal approach to cover uninsured individuals who fall into the \"coverage gap\" in states that do not expand Medicaid -- having incomes above Medicaid eligibility limits but below the federal poverty level, which is the lower limit for premium tax credit eligibility --make health insurance coverage available to uninsured individuals who fall into the coverage gap at no or nominal cost, with significant cost-sharing protections; (b) will advocate that any federal approach to cover uninsured individuals who fall into the coverage gap provide states that have already implemented Medicaid expansions with additional incentives to maintain their expansions; (c) supports extending eligibility to purchase Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace coverage to undocumented immigrants and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients, with the guarantee that health plans and ACA ma rketplaces will not collect and/or report data regarding enrollee immigration status; and (d) recognizes the potential for state and local initiatives to provide coverage to immigrants without regard to immigration status. Universal Health Coverage H-165.904 Our AMA: (1) seeks to ensure that federal health system reform include payment for the urgent and emergent treatment of illnesses and injuries of indigent, non- U.S. citizens in the U.S. or its territories; (2) seeks federal legislation that would requi re the federal government to provide CMS Rep. 01- A-23 -- page 13 of 82 POLICY # Title Text Recommendation financial support to any individuals, organizations, and institutions providing legally - mandated health care services to foreign nationals and other persons not covered under health system reform; and (3) continues to a ssign a high priority to the problem of the medically uninsured and underinsured and continues to work toward national consensus on providing access to adequate health care coverage for all Americans.

Rescind. Superseded by Policy H-225.950 . AMA Principles for Physician Employment H-225.950 1. Addressing Conflicts of Interest a) A physician 's paramount responsibility is to his or her patients. Additionally, given that an employed physician occupies a posi tion of significant trust, he or she owes a duty of loyalty to his or her employer. This divided loyalty can create conflicts of interest, such as financial incentives to over - or under - treat patients, which employed physicians should strive to recognize a nd address. b) Employed physicians should be free to exercise their personal and professional judgment in voting, speaking and advocating on any manner regarding patient care interests, the profession, health care in the community, and the independent exer cise of medical judgment. Employed physicians should not be deemed in breach of their employment agreements, nor be retaliated against by their employers, for asserting these CMS Rep. 01- A-23 -- page 44 of 82 POLICY # Title Text Recommendation interests. Employed physicians also should enjoy academic freedom to pursue clini cal research and other academic pursuits within the ethical principles of the medical profession and the guidelines of the organization. c) In any situation where the economic or other interests of the employer are in conflict with patient welfare, patien t welfare must take priority. d) Physicians should always make treatment and referral decisions based on the best interests of their patients. Employers and the physicians they employ must assure that agreements or understandings (explicit or implicit) restricting, discouraging, or encouraging particular treatment or referral options are disclosed to patients. (i) No physician should be required or coerced to perform or assist in any non -emergent procedure that would be contrary to his/her religious beliefs or moral convictions; and (ii) No physician should be discriminated against in employment, promotion, or the extension of staff or other privileges because he/she either performed or assisted in a lawful, non -emergent procedure, or refused to do so on the grounds that it violates his/her religious beliefs or moral convictions. e) Assuming a title or position that may remove a physician from direct patient -physician relationships --such as medical director, vice president for medical affairs, etc. --does not override professional ethic al obligations. Physicians whose actions serve to override the individual patient care decisions of other physicians are themselves engaged in the CMS Rep. 01- A-23 -- page 45 of 82 POLICY # Title Text Recommendation practice of medicine and are subject to professional ethical obligations and may be legally responsible for s uch decisions. Physicians who hold administrative leadership positions should use whatever administrative and governance mechanisms exist within the organization to foster policies that enhance the quality of patient care and the patient care experience. 2. Advocacy for Patients and the Profession a) Patient advocacy is a fundamental element of the patient- physician relationship that should not be altered by the health care system or setting in which physicians practice, or the methods by which they are c ompensated. b) Employed physicians should be free to engage in volunteer work outside of, and which does not interfere with, their duties as employees. 3. Contracting a) Physicians should be free to enter into mutually satisfactory contractual arrangemen ts, including employment, with hospitals, health care systems, medical groups, insurance plans, and other entities as permitted by law and in accordance with the ethical principles of the medical profession. b) Physicians should never be coerced into empl oyment with hospitals, health care systems, medical groups, insurance plans, or any other entities. Employment agreements between physicians and their employers should be negotiated in good faith. Both parties are urged to obtain the advice of legal counse l experienced in physician employment matters when negotiating employment contracts. CMS Rep. 01- A-23 -- page 46 of 82 POLICY # Title Text Recommendation c) When a physician 's compensation is related to the revenue he or she generates, or to similar factors, the employer should make clear to the physician the factors upon which compensation is based. d) Termination of an employment or contractual relationship between a physician and an entity employing that physician does not necessarily end the patient - physician relationship between the employed physician and persons unde r his/her care. When a physician's employment status is unilaterally terminated by an employer, the physician and his or her employer should notify the physician's patients that the physician will no longer be working with the employer and should provide them with the physician's new contact information. Patients should be given the choice to continue to be seen by the physician in his or her new practice setting or to be treated by another physician still working with the employer. Records for the physicia n's patients should be retained for as long as they are necessary for the care of the patients or for addressing legal issues faced by the physician; records should not be destroyed without notice to the former employee. Where physician possession of all m edical records of his or her patients is not already required by state law, the employment agreement should specify that the physician is entitled to copies of patient charts and records upon a specific request in writing from any patient, or when such rec ords are necessary for the physician 's defense in malpractice actions, administrative investigations, CMS Rep. 01- A-23 -- page 47 of 82 POLICY # Title Text Recommendation or other proceedings against the physician. (e) Physician employment agreements should contain provisions to protect a physician's right to due process before termination for cause. When such cause relates to quality, patient safety, or any other matter that could trigger the initiation of disciplinary action by the medical staff, the physician should be afforded full due process under the medical staff byl aws, and the agreement should not be terminated before the governing body has acted on the recommendation of the medical staff. Physician employment agreements should specify whether or not termination of employment is grounds for automatic termination of hospital medical staff membership or clinical privileges. When such cause is non-clinical or not otherwise a concern of the medical staff, the physician should be afforded whatever due process is outlined in the employer's human resources policies and procedures. (f) Physicians are encouraged to carefully consider the potential benefits and harms of entering into employment agreements containing without cause termination provisions. Employers should never terminate agreements without cause when the underly ing reason for the termination relates to quality, patient safety, or any other matter that could trigger the initiation of disciplinary action by the medical staff. (g) Physicians are discouraged from entering into agreements that restrict the physician 's right to practice medicine for a specified period of time or in a CMS Rep. 01- A-23 -- page 48 of 82 POLICY # Title Text Recommendation specified area upon termination of employment. (h) Physician employment agreements should contain dispute resolution provisions. If the parties desire an alternative to going to court, such as arbitration, the contract should specify the manner in which disputes will be resolved. 4. Hospital Medical Staff Relations a) Employed physicians should be members of the organized medical staffs of the hospitals or health systems with which they have contractual or financial arrangements, should be subject to the bylaws of those medical staffs, and should conduct their professional activities according to the bylaws, standards, rules, and regulations and policies adopted by those medical staffs. b) Regardless of the employment status of its individual members, the organized medical staff remains responsible for the provision of quality care and must work collectively to improve patient care and outcomes. c) Employed physicians who are members of t he organized medical staff should be free to exercise their personal and professional judgment in voting, speaking, and advocating on any matter regarding medical staff matters and should not be deemed in breach of their employment agreements, nor be retal iated against by their employers, for asserting these interests. d) Employers should seek the input of the medical staff prior to the initiation, renewal, or termination of exclusive employment contracts. CMS Rep. 01- A-23 -- page 49 of 82 POLICY # Title Text Recommendation 5. Peer Review and Performance Evaluations a) All physicians should promote and be subject to an effective program of peer review to monitor and evaluate the quality, appropriateness, medical necessity, and efficiency of the patient care services provided within their practice settings. b) Peer review s hould follow established procedures that are identical for all physicians practicing within a given health care organization, regardless of their employment status. c) Peer review of employed physicians should be conducted independently of and without int erference from any human resources activities of the employer. Physicians -- not lay administrators --should be ultimately responsible for all peer review of medical services provided by employed physicians. d) Employed physicians should be accorded due proc ess protections, including a fair and objective hearing, in all peer review proceedings. The fundamental aspects of a fair hearing are a listing of specific charges, adequate notice of the right to a hearing, the opportunity to be present and to rebut evidence, and the opportunity to present a defense. Due process protections should extend to any disciplinary action sought by the employer that relates to the employed physician' s independent exercise of medical judgment. e) Employers should provide employed physicians with regular performance evaluations, which should be presented in writing and accompanied by an oral discussion with the employed CMS Rep. 01- A-23 -- page 50 of 82 POLICY # Title Text Recommendation physician. Physicians should be informed before the beginning of the evaluation period of the general criteria to be considered in their performance evaluations, for example: quality of medical services provided, nature and frequency of patient complaints, employee productivity, employee contribution to the administrative/operational activities of the employer, etc. (f) Upon termination of employment with or without cause, an employed physician generally should not be required to resign his or her hospital medical staff membership or any of the clinical privileges held during the term of employment, unless an independent action of the medical staff calls for such action, and the physician has been afforded full due process under the medical staff bylaws. Automatic rescission of medical staff membership and/or clinical privileges following termination of an employment agreement is tolerable only if each of the following conditions is met: i. The agreement is for the provision of services on an exclusive basis; and ii. Prior to the termination of the exclusive contract, the medical staff holds a hearing, as defined by the medical staff and hospital, to permit interested parties to express their views on the matter, with the medical staff subsequently making a recommendation to the governing body as to whether the contract should be terminated, as outlined in AMA Policy H -225.985; and iii. The agreement explicitly states that medical staff membership and/or clinical privileges must be resigned CMS Rep. 01- A-23 -- page 51 of 82 POLICY # Title Text Recommendation upon termination of the agreement. 6. Payment Agreements a) Although they typically assign their billing privileges to their employers, employed physicians or their chosen representatives should be prospectively involved if the employer negotiates agreements for them for professional fees, capitation or global billing, or shared savings. Additionally, employed physicians should be informed about the actual payment amount allocated to the professional fee component of the total payment received by the contractual arrangement. b) Employed physicians have a respons ibility to assure that bills issued for services they provide are accurate and should therefore retain the right to review billing claims as may be necessary to verify that such bills are correct. Employers should indemnify and defend, and save harmless, employed physicians with respect to any violation of law or regulation or breach of contract in connection with the employer's billing for physician services, which violation is not the fault of the employee. H-285.931 The Critical Role of Physicians in He alth Plans and Integrated Delivery Systems Our AMA adopts the following organizational principles for physician involvement in health plans and integrated delivery systems (IDS): (1) Practicing physicians participating in a health plan/IDS must: (a) be i nvolved in the selection and removal of their leaders who are involved in governance or who serve on a council of advisors to the governing Retain.

CMS Rep. 01- A-23 -- page 52 of 82 POLICY # Title Text Recommendation body or management; (b) be involved in the development of credentialing criteria, utilization management criteria, clinical practice guidelines, medical review criteria, and continuous quality improvement, and their leaders must be involved in the approval of these processes; (c)be accountable to their peers for professional decisions based on accepted standards of care and evidence- based medicine; (d) be involved in development of criteria used by the health plan in determining medical necessity and coverage decisions; and (e) have access to a due process system. (2) Representatives of the practicing physicians in a health plan/IDS must be the decision -makers in the credentialing and recredentialing process. (3) To maximize the opportunity for clinical integration and improvement in patient care, all of the specialties participating in a clinical process must be involve d in the development of clinical practice guidelines and disease management protocols. (4) A health plan/IDS has the right to make coverage decisions, but practicing physicians participating in the health plan/IDS must be able to discuss treatment alternat ives with their patients to enable them to make informed decisions. (5) Practicing physicians and patients of a health plan/IDS should have access to a timely, expeditious internal appeals process. Physicians CMS Rep. 01- A-23 -- page 53 of 82 POLICY # Title Text Recommendation serving on an appeals panel should be practicing participants of the health plan/IDS, and they must have experience in the care under dispute. If the internal appeal is denied, a plan member should be able to appeal the medical necessity determination or coverage decision to an independent review organization. (6) The quality assessment process and peer review protections must extend to all sites of care, e.g., hospital, office, long -term care and home health care. (7) Representatives of the practicing physicians of a health plan/IDS must be involved in the design of the data collection systems and interpretation of the data so produced, to ensure that the information will be beneficial to physicians in their daily practice. All practicing physicians should receive appropriate, periodic, and comparative performance and utilization data. (8) To maximize the opportunity for improvement, practicing physicians who are involved in continuous quality improvement activities must have access to skilled resource people and information management systems that provi de information on clinical performance, patient satisfaction, and health status. There must be physician/manager teams to identify, improve and document cost/quality relationships that demonstrate value. (9) Physician representatives/leaders must communica te key policies CMS Rep. 01-A-23 -- page 54 of 82 POLICY # Title Text Recommendation and procedures to the practicing physicians who participate in the health plan/IDS. Participating physicians must have an identified process to access their physician representative. (10) Consideration should be given to compensating physic ian leaders/representatives involved in governance and management for their time away from practice. Our AMA aggressively advocates to private health care accreditation organizations the incorporation of the organizational principles for physician involvement into their standards for health plans, networks and integrated delivery systems. H-285.940 Denials of Payment for Necessary Services Because of Lack of Authorization 1. Our AMA seeks the elimination of clauses in managed care contracts that allow plans to refuse to pay for provision of covered services for the sole reason that required notification of these services was not reported in a timely manner. 2. Our AMA supports a requirement that payers provide a retro -authorization process, with reasonable timeframes for submission and consideration and with reasonable procedural standards for all te sts, procedures, treatments, medications and evaluations requiring authorization. Rescind. Superseded by Policy H-320.939 . Prior Authorization and Utilization Management Reform H -320.939 1. Our AMA will continue its widespread prior authorization (PA) advocacy and outreach, including promotion and/or adoption of the Prior Authorization and Utilization Manag ement Reform Principles, AMA model legislation, Prior Authorization Physician Survey and other PA research, and the AMA Prior Authorization Toolkit, which is aimed at reducing PA administrative burdens and improving patient access to care. 2. Our AMA will oppose health plan determinations on physician appeals based solely on medical coding and advocate for such decisions to be based on the direct review of a physician of the same CMS Rep. 01-A-23 -- page 55 of 82 POLICY # Title Text Recommendation medical specialty/subspecialty as the prescribing/ordering physician. 3. Our AMA supports efforts to track and quantify the impact of health plans' prior authorization and utilization management processes on patient access to necessary care and patient clinical outcomes, including the extent to which these processes contribute to patient harm. 4. Our AMA will advocate for health plans to minimize the burden on patients, physicians, and medical centers when updates must be made to previously approved and/or pending prior authorization requests. H-315.973 Guiding Princ iples for the Collection, Use and Warehousing of Electronic Medical Records and Claims Data 1. It is AMA policy that any payer, clearinghouse, vendor, or other entity that collects and uses electronic medical records and claims data adhere to the followin g principles: a. Electronic medical records and claims data transmitted for any given purpose to a third party must be the minimum necessary needed to accomplish the intended purpose. b. All covered entities involved in the collection and use of electroni c medical records and claims data must comply with the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules. c. The physician must be informed and provide permission for any analysis undertaken with his/her electronic medical records and claims data, including the data being studied and how the results will be used. d. Any additional work required by the physician practice to collect data beyond the average data collection for the submission of transactions (e.g., claims, Rescind. Superseded by Policy D-478.995 .

Our AMA: (A) advocates for standardization of key elements of electronic health record (EHR) and computerized physician order entry (CPOE) user interface design during the ongoing development of this technology; (B) advocates that medical facilities and health systems work toward standardized login procedures and parameters to reduce user login fatigue; and (C) CMS Rep. 01- A-23 -- page 56 of 82 POLICY # Title Text Recommendation eligibility) must be compensated by the entity request ing the data. e. Criteria developed for the analysis of physician claims or medical record data must be open for review and input by relevant outside entities. f. Methods and criteria for analyzing the electronic medical records and claims data must be pro vided to the physician or an independent third party so re -analysis of the data can be performed. g. An appeals process must be in place for a physician to appeal, prior to public release, any adverse decision derived from an analysis of his/her electronic medical records and claims data. h. Clinical data collected by a data exchange network and searchable by a record locator service must be accessible only for payment and health care operations. 2. It is AMA policy that any physician, payer, clearinghouse , vendor, or other entity that warehouses electronic medical records and claims data adhere to the following principles: a. The warehouse vendor must take the necessary steps to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic medical records and claims data while protecting against threats to the security or integrity and unauthorized uses or disclosure of the information. b. Electronic medical records data must remain accessible to authorized users for purposes of treatment, public health, patient safety, quality improvement, medical liability defense, and research. c. Physician and patient advocates for continued research and physician education on EHR and CPOE user interface design specifically concerning key design principles and features that can improve the quality, safety, and efficiency of health care; and (D) advocates for continued research on EHR, CPOE and clinical decision support systems and vendor accountability for the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of these systems. 3. Our AMA will request that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services: (A) s upport an external, independent evaluation of the effect of Electronic Medical Record (EMR) implementation on patient safety and on the productivity and financial solvency of hospitals and physicians' practices; and (B) develop, with physician input, minim um standards to be applied to outcome -based initiatives measured during this rapid implementation phase of EMRs. 4. Our AMA will (A) seek legislation or regulation to require all EHR vendors to utilize standard and interoperable software technology compone nts to enable cost efficient use of electronic health records across all health care delivery systems including institutional and community based settings of care delivery; and (B) work with CMS to incentivize hospitals and health systems to achieve interconnectivity and interoperability of electronic health records systems with independent physician practices to enable the efficient and cost effective use and sharing of electronic health records across all settings of care delivery. CMS Rep. 01-A-23 -- page 57 of 82 POLICY # Title Text Recommendation permission must be obtained for any person or entity other than the physician or patient to access and use individually identifiable clinical data , when the physician is specifically identified. d. Following the request from a physician to transfer his/her data to another data warehouse, the current vendor must transfer the electronic medical records and claims data and must delete/destroy the data from its data warehouse once the transfer has been completed and confirmed. 5. Our AMA will seek to incorporate incremental steps to achieve electronic health record (EHR) data portability as part of the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology's (ONC) certification process. 6. Our AMA will collaborate with EHR vendors and other stakeholders to enhance transparency and establish processes to achieve data portability. 7. Our AMA will directly engage the EHR vendor community to promote improvements in EHR usability. 8. Our AMA will advocate for appropriate, effective, and less burdensome documentation requirements in the use of electronic health records. 9. Our AMA will urge EHR vendors to adopt social determinants of health templates, created with input from our AMA, medical specialty societies, and other stakeholders with expertise in social determinants of health metrics and development, without adding further cost or documentation burden for physicians.

Physicians' Experiences with Retrospective Denial of Payment and Down -Coding by Managed Care Plans H- 320.948 It is the policy o f our AMA, when a health plan or utilization review organization makes a determination to retrospectively deny payment for a medical service, or down - code such a service, the physician rendering the service, as well as the patient CMS Rep. 01- A-23 -- page 58 of 82 POLICY # Title Text Recommendation who received the service, shall receive written notification in a timely manner that includes: (1) the principal reason(s) for the determination; (2) the clinical rationale used in making the determination; and (3) a statement describing the process for appeal. Medicare Review Activities H-340.898 Our AMA: (1) strongly urges CMS to provide physician organizations with the opportunity for significant comment and input on the Medicare Integrity Program; (2) continues to oppose any type of \"bounty\" system for compensation to any Medicare contractor, including those in the Medicare Integrity Program, and instead urge CMS to base compensation on the proper repayment of claims, rather than on the numbers of resulting referrals to law enforcement agencies; (3) continues to advoca te for the ongoing involvement of physician organizations and hospital and organized medical staffs in refining and implementing any Medicare review contractor's activities and the need to emphasize physician education and clinical improvements; (4) urges CMS to delete all \"incentives\" or other \"award fees\" for any Medicare review contractor; and (5) urges CMS to clarify that in any Statement of Work or contract with a Medicare review contractor that: (a) extrapolation should not occur unless it is to develop educational or compliance program interventions; and (b) referrals to the Office of Inspector General should not occur unless a hospital does not respond to intervention or CMS Rep. 01- A-23 -- page 59 of 82 POLICY # Title Text Recommendation when significant evidence of fraud exists. H-330.886 Strengthening Medicare Through Competitive Bidding 1. Our AMA supports the following principles to guide the use of competitive bidding among health insurers in the Medicare program: a. Eligible bidders should be subject to specific quality and financial requirements to ensure sufficient skill and capacity to provide services to beneficiaries. b. Bidding entities must be able to demonstrate the adequacy of their physician and provider networks. c. Bids must be based on a clearly defined set of standardized benefits that should include, at a minimum, all services provided under the traditional Medicare program and a cap on out -of-pocket expenses. d. Bids should be developed based on the cost of providing the minimum set of benefits to a standardized Medicare beneficiary within a given geographic region. e. Geographic regions should be defined to ensure adequate coverage and maximize competition for beneficiaries in a service area. f. All contracting entities should be required to offer beneficiaries a plan th at includes only the standardized benefit package. Expanded benefit options could also be offered for beneficiaries willing to pay higher premiums. g. Processes and resources must be in place to provide beneficiary education and support for choosing among alternative plans. 2. Our AMA supports using a competitive bidding Retain. Still relevant.

H-330.952 Medicare Carrier Advisory Committee The AMA will advocate to all relevant parties (e.g., CMS and Medicare carriers) that the role of the state medical associations and state specialty societies in representing the interests and views of physicians in their respective states should not in any way be diminished by the operations of the Medicare Carrier Advis ory Committee. Retain. Still relevant. H-330.958 Regionalization of Medicare Carriers The AMA will continue to: (1) encourage state medical associations and national medical specialty societies to participate proactively in the Medicare Carrier \"Notice and Comment\" program with their respective carriers; and (2) monitor the impact of present and future Medicare carrier regionalization on the consistency of carrier interpretations and efficiency of operations. Retain. Still relevant. H-335.978 Medicare Fair Hearing The AMA urges CMS to encourage Medicare carriers to utilize as Hearing Officers licensed physicians of the same specialty and in the same geographical area as that of the physician who requests the Fair Hearing and to make known to the requesting physician, prior to the Fair Hearing, the educational and medical credentials of the Hearing Officer.

H-365.997 Corporation or Employer -Sponsored Examinations The AMA encourages employers who provide or arrange for special or comprehensive medical examinations of employees to be responsible for assuring that these examinations are done by physicians competent to pe rform the type of examination required. Whenever practical, the employee should be referred to his or her personal physician for such professional services. In the many instances in which an employee does not have a personal physician, efforts should be ma de to assist him or her in obtaining one, with emphasis on continuity of care. This effort should be aided by the local medical society wherever possible. Retain. Still relevant.

Rescind. Superseded by Policies H-165.888 and H-155.960. Evaluating Health System Reform Proposals H-165.888 1. Our AMA will continue its efforts to ensure that health system reform proposals adhere to the following principles: A. Physicians maintain primary ethical responsibility to advocate for their patients ' interests and needs. B. Unfair concentration of market power of payers is detrimental to patients and physicians, if patient freedom of choice or physician ability to select mode of practice is limited or denied. Single -payer systems clearly fall within such a definition and, consequently, should continue to be opposed by the AMA. Reform proposals should balance fairly the market power between payers and physicians or be opposed. C. All health system reform proposals should include a valid estimate of implementation cost, based on all health care expenditu res to be included in the reform; and supports the concept that all health system reform proposals should identify specifically what means of funding (including employer -mandated funding, general taxation, payroll or value -added taxation) will be used to pay for the reform proposal and what the impact will be. D. All physicians participating in managed care plans and medical delivery systems must be able without threat of punitive action to comment on and present their positions on the plan's policies and CMS Rep. 01- A-23 -- page 64 of 82 POLICY # Title Text Recommendation procedures for medical review, quality assurance, grievance procedures, credentialing criteria, and other financial and administrative matters, including physician representation on the governing board and key committees of the plan. E. Any national legislation for health system reform should include sufficient and continuing financial support for inner- city and rural hospitals, community health centers, clinics, special programs for special populations and other essential public health facilities that serve underserved populations that otherwise lack the financial means to pay for their health care. F. Health system reform proposals and ultimate legislation should result in adequate resources to enable medical schools and residen cy programs to produce an adequate supply and appropriate generalist/specialist mix of physicians to deliver patient care in a reformed health care system. G. All civilian federal government employees, including Congress and the Administration, should be covered by any health care delivery system passed by Congress and signed by the President. H. True health reform is impossible without true tort reform. 2. Our AMA supports health care reform that meets the needs of all Americans including people with injur ies, congenital or acquired disabilities, and chronic conditions, and as such values function and its improvement as key outcomes to be CMS Rep. 01- A-23 -- page 65 of 82 POLICY # Title Text Recommendation specifically included in national health care reform legislation. 3. Our AMA supports health care reform that meets the needs of all Americans including people with mental illness and substance use / addiction disorders and will advocate for the inclusion of full parity for the treatment of mental illness and substance use / addiction disorders in all national health care r eform legislation. 4. Our AMA supports health system reform alternatives that are consistent with AMA principles of pluralism, freedom of choice, freedom of practice, and universal access for patients. Strategies to Address Rising Health Care Costs H -155.960 Our AMA: (1) recognizes that successful cost-containment and quality- improvement initiatives must involve physician leadership, as well as collaboration among physicians, patients, insurers, employers, unions, and government; (2) supports the following broad strategies for addressing rising health care costs: (a) reduce the burden of preventable disease; (b) make health care delivery more efficient; (c) reduce non - clinical health system costs that do not contribute value to patient care; and (d) promote \" value -based decision -making \" at all levels; (3) will continue to advocate that physicians be supported in routinely providing lifestyle counseling to patients through: adequate third -party reimbursement; inclusion of lifestyle counseling in quality measurement and pay -for- performance incentives; and CMS Rep. 01- A-23 -- page 66 of 82 POLICY # Title Text Recommendation medical education and training; (4) will continue to advocate that sources of medical research funding give priority to studies that collect both clinical and cost data; use evaluation criteria that take into account cost impacts as well as clinical outcomes; translate research findings into useable information on the relative cost -effectiveness of alternative diagnostic services and treatments; and widely disseminate cost -effectiveness information to physicians and other health care decision - makers; (5) will continue to advocate that health information systems be designed to provide physicians and other health care decision -makers with relevant, timely, actionable information, autom atically at the point of care and without imposing undue administrative burden, including: clinical guidelines and protocols; relative cost -effectiveness of alternative diagnostic services and treatments; quality measurement and pay -for- performance criteri a; patient- specific clinical and insurance information; prompts and other functionality to support lifestyle counseling, disease management, and case management; and alerts to flag and avert potential medical errors; (6) encourages the development and adoption of clinical performance and quality measures aimed at reducing overuse of clinically unwarranted services and increasing the use of recommended services known to yield cost savings; (7) encourages third- party payers to use targeted benefit design, whe reby patient cost - CMS Rep. 01- A-23 -- page 67 of 82 POLICY # Title Text Recommendation sharing requirements are determined based on the clinical value of a health care service or treatment. Consideration should be given to further tailoring cost- sharing requirements to patient income and other factors known to impact compliance; and (8) supports ongoing investigation and cost - effectiveness analysis of non - clinical health system spending, to reduce costs that do not add value to patient care. (9) Our AMA will, in all reform efforts, continue to identify appropriate cost savin gs strategies for our patients and the health care system. H-385.963 Physician Review of Accounts Sent for Collection (1) The AMA encourages all physicians and employers of physicians who treat patients to review their accounting/collection policies to ensure that no patient's account is sent to collection without the physician's knowledge. (2) The AMA urges physicians to use compassion and discretion in sending accounts of their patients to collection, especially accoun ts of patients who are terminally ill, homeless, disabled, impoverished, or have marginal access to medical care.

Our AMA will continue to advocate, as long as the three - day stay requirement remains in effect, that patient time spent in the hospital, observation care or in the emergency department count toward the three -day hospital inpatient requirement for Medicare coverage of post - hospital skilled nursing facility services. 3. Our AMA will actively work with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to eliminate any regulations requiring inpatient hospitalization as a prerequisite before a Medicare beneficiary is eligible for skilled (SNF) or long -term care (LTC) placement. H-390.962 Notification to Patients of Charge Amounts Prior to Service as Per Omn ibus Reconciliation Act of 1986 (1) The AMA opposes efforts by commercial carriers or the federal government which would require physicians to predict reimbursement for services rendered.

(3) The AMA supports repeal of those provisions of OBRA that require physicians to refund payments associated with Medicare services that are deemed medically unnecessary by CMS after the fact. (4) The AMA believes tha t increases in Medicare reimbursement need to be universal, that current reimbursement should be adjusted and that there should be no discrimination in schedules between participating and nonparticipating physicians to be contacted regarding questions about the review; and (c) the screening criteria or parameter used in denying payment for the service. Additionally, Policy H-330.892 supports physician choice of Medicare participation. Medicare Participation Status H-330.982 It is AMA policy to eliminate any restrictions, including timing, on physicians' ability to determine their Medicare participation status. H-390.992 Prospective Payment System and DRGs for Physicians The AMA (1) endorses the concept that any system of reimbursement for physicians ' services should be independent of reimbursement systems for other providers of health care; and (2) opposes expansion of p rospective pricing systems until their impact on the quality, cost and access to medical care have been adequately evaluated. Rescind. Superseded by Policy H-385.989. Payment for Physicians Services H-385.989 Our AMA: (1) supports a pluralistic approach to third party payment methodology under fee -for-service, and does not support a preference for \"usual and customary or reasonable\" (UCR) or any other specific payment methodology; (2) affirms the following four principles: (a) Physicians have the right to establish their fees at a level which they believe fairly reflects the costs of providing a service and the value of their professional judgment. (b) Physicians should continue to volunteer fee information to patients, to discuss fees in advance of service where feasible, to expand the practice of accepting any third party allowances as payment in full in cases of financial hardship, and to communicate voluntarily to their patients their willingness to make appropriate arrangements in cases of financial need. (c) Physicians should have the CMS Rep. 01-A-23 -- page 71 of 82 POLICY # Title Text Recommendation right to choose the basic mechanism of payment for their services, and specifically to choose whether or not to participate in a particular insurance plan or method of payment, and to accept or decline a third party allowance as payment in full for a service. (d) All methods of physician payment should incorporate mechanisms to foster increased cost - awareness by both providers and recipients of service; and (3) supports modifica tion of current legal restrictions, so as to allow meaningful involvement by physician groups in: (a) negotiations on behalf of those physicians who do not choose to accept third party allowances as full payment, so that the amount of such allowances can b e more equitably determined; (b) establishing additional limits on the amount or the rate of increase in charge -related payment levels when appropriate; and (c) professional fee review for the protection of the public. Additionally, Policy H-385.922 supports using the term \"payment\" instead of \"reimbursement\" as the term for compensating phys icians. Payment Terminology H-385.922 It is AMA policy to change the terminology used in compensating physicians from \"reimbursement \" to \"payment. \" H-400.984 Geographic Practice Costs 1.

Our AMA supports the use of physician office rent data, along with other practice expense data, to measure geographic variation in rent costs and to determine the proportion of overall costs that relate to rental expense. These data should be obtained through new or existing data sources that are accurate, standardized, verifiable and include per unit costs in physician offices. H-400.988 Medicare Reimbursement, Geographical Differences The AMA reaffirms its policy that geographic variations under a Medicare payment schedule should reflect only valid and demonstrable differences in physician practice costs, especially liability premiums, with other non-geographic practice cost index (GPCI) - based adjustments as needed to remedy demonstrable access problems in specific geographic areas.

REPORT OF THE COUNCIL ON MEDICAL SERVICE CMS Report 05- A-23 Subject: Prescription Drug Dispensing Policies (Resolution 237 -A-22) Presented by: Lynn Jeffers , MD, MBA, Chair Referred to: Reference Committee G At the June 2022 Annual Meeting, the House of Delegates referred Resolution 237 -A-22, 1 Prescription Drug Dispensing Policies, which was sponsored by the Ohio Delegation and asks that 2 the American Medical Association ( AMA ) work with pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) to 3 eliminate any financial incentives that may exist for patients to receive a supply of medication that 4 is greater than the physician prescribed. Resolution 237- A-22 also asks that the AMA create model 5 state legislation to restrict dispensing a pr escription drug in greater quantities than prescribed, and 6 support legislation that supports removing financial barriers that favor dispensing of quantities 7 greater than prescribed. This report provides background on the process of drug dispensing 8 quantities , reviews relevant AMA policy, and makes policy recommendations. 9 10 BACKGROUND 11 12 When physicians write prescription s and provide them to their patients , an insurance company 13 and/or PBM may influence not only the cost of the medication, but also the amount that is 14 dispensed to the patient1. In certain situations, such as when a patient is taking a maintenance 15 medication, the insurer or PBM, may be incentivized to require a 90 -day supply to be dispensed, 16 even if a 30- day supply was prescribed .2 While this may not be an issue once the patient's 17 medication and dosage are established, it can be a problem for patients and physicians when 18 initially assessing medications, dosages, or making changes to either. When physician s write 19 prescri ptions with a set number of refills, some states allow pharmacists to dispense the total 20 amount .2 For example, a prescription for a 30 -day supply of medication with two refills could 21 result in these pharmacies dispensing the total 90 -day supply at once. 22 23 PBM AND INSURER INFLUENCE ON DISPENSING QUANTITIES 24 25 To fully understand the pressures to dispense a 90- day supply it is important to understand the 26 relationship between PBMs, health insurers, and the pharmacies that end up dispensing the 27 medication. PBMs a re considered a n intermediary that works to manage prescription drug benefits 28 for secondary entities, like health insurers. PBMs have the stated goal of working to lower drug 29 prices through their work negotiating rebates and discounts off the list price of drugs. However, a 30 lack of transparency and regulation into these efforts have yielded confusion and doubt as to if this 31 goal is being met .3 Current efforts by both the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Congress are 32 being made to investigate and better understand the innerworkings of PBMs in the process.4 33 34 The process of dispensing medication has multiple intersections between PBMs, payers, and 35 pharmacies. PBMs pay pharmacies a drug dispensing fee and negotiate rate prices with the 36 manufacturer, while i nsurers pay the PBMs fees for administrative work and dispensing fees for 37 CMS Rep. 05- A-23 -- page 2 of 8 medications. For PBMs and payers, these points of intersection may be areas where requiring a 1 larger quantity of medication to be dispensed is advantageous. For example, when a large r quantity 2 of medication is being negotiated, it gives the PBM better negotiating power and can lead to lower 3 negotiated prices or larger rebates. For both PBMs and payers, dispensing greater supplies of 4 medication can lower the dispensing costs associated with the medication. Additionally, it is not 5 uncommon for PBMs and/or health insurers to own and operate automatic dispensing facilities, 6 such as mail order pharmacies, and dispensing greater quantities of a medication can lower 7 operating costs in these settings as well .5 One place of major PBM reform that is promoted by the 8 National Community Pharmacist Association, is centered around the mandatory use of these PBM 9 owned mail order pharmacies that often depersonalize the proces s. This is especially relevant to the 10 quantity of a medication dispensed as the safeguards of both physicians and pharmacists interacting 11 with the patient are removed in the automated process used with PBM -owned mail order 12 pharmacies .6 13 14 Overall, the insertion of payers and PBMs in the process of determining the quantity of a 15 prescription medication dispensed is opposed both by the AMA and community pharmacists, the 16 two entities that interact most directly with the patient. While there can be benefits to the 17 dispensing of a larger supply of medication, especially in the cost savings for the PBM and/or 18 payer, the decision is one that needs to be made on a patient level and under the supervision and 19 control of the prescribing physician. 20 21 POTENTIAL PATIENT RISKS OF A 90 -DAY SUPPLY 22 23 Among the key concerns when a patient receives a quantity of a prescription drug that is greater 24 than what was prescribed include the risk of intentional overdose. While there is not a guarantee 25 that a physician wi ll be aware of a patient's suicide risk, there is an opportunity for assessment, 26 both formal and informal, during a medical appointment. Pharmacists' interactions with patients 27 would not typically include this type of screening process and, thus, they may not be aware of a 28 potential risk. Unfortunately, even if a risk was recognized , PBM s, who are further removed from 29 direct patient engagement, may force pharmacists to fill larger quantities without the ability to 30 apply insurance coverage at lower quantities. Currently, there are strict regulations on the quantity 31 of controlled substances that can be dispensed as these medications are often seen in suicide 32 attempts or completions .7,8 However, other prescription medications are not regulated at the same 33 level and may still be used in suicide attempts or completions.8,9. 34 35 A second concern regarding patients receiving quantities of prescription medication greater than 36 prescribed is the oversupply of medications. Oversupply is a concern with regard to the potential 37 for increased cost to the patient and patient stockpiling. When a prescription is dispensed at a 38 greater quantity than prescribed, a patient may not need the full 90 days. For example, if a 39 medication is new and the physician is working with the patient to establish the correct dosage 40 there may be a change in the dosage prior to completion of the full 90 days. The oversupply of a 41 prescription drug can lead to a patient stockpiling a medication, which, eve n when unintentional, 42 can be dangerous and should be avoided.10 In addition to the potential for a medication to be 43 stockpiled, it is possible that this oversupply could place an undue financial burden on the patient. 44 For instance, should a patient be pres cribed a medication with a substantial co -pay that is only 45 covered in a 90- day supply, but that prescription is altered before completion of the 90 days, the 46 patient may be responsible for an additional, expensive co- pay. The cost of prescription 47 medicatio ns in the United States is a major barrier for many to access the care they require and 48 should be mitigated whenever possible .11 49 CMS Rep. 05-A-23 -- page 3 of 8 POTENTIAL PATIENT BENEFITS OF A 90 -DAY SUPPLY 1 2 While there are some substantial potential risks associated with dispensing lar ger supplies of 3 medication than prescribed, there are some potential benefits as well . When allowed, pharmacists 4 may be inclined or forced to dispense the larger supply due to the financial benefits and improved 5 patient adherence to the medication regimen. Each year, a lack of medication adherence directly 6 relates to approximately 10 percent of all health care spending in the United States7. Research has 7 demonstrated that a larger supply of medication has been linked with greater medication adherence, 8 which is especially true in patients who traditionally have the lowest levels of adherence. This 9 improvement in adherence is explained by reduction of barriers and improvement in convenience 10 for the patient. For example, if a patient ha s diff iculty finding transportation to and from the 11 pharmacy, reducing the number of trips may boost adherence. Additionally, patients report greater 12 satisfaction with a greater supply of medication, especially for those who have multiple 13 prescriptions. Most importantly, adherence to medications, particularly medications for chronic 14 diseases like hypertension and diabetes, significantly improves patient outcomes and reduces health 15 care costs.7 16 17 In addition to greater medication adherence, there is the added benef it of cost savings with a larger 18 quantity of medication for the pharmacy and the patient. Prescription drug cost reduction is 19 typically centered around a lower distribution cost, negotiated drug cost, and potential rebates.5 20 These potential advantages can lead to cost-savings to the pati ent, as well as a reduction in the time 21 spent obtaining their prescriptions . However, to ensure that patients are receiving lowered costs 22 when appropriate, but not an oversupply of medication, it is important that the decision regarding 23 amounts of dispensed medications remain within the context of the patient- physician relationship. 24 25 RELEVANT AMA POLICY 26 27 The AMA currently has policies that address the dispensing of prescription drugs. The most 28 directly relevant AMA policies o n the topic of medication dispensing are Policies H-120.962 and 29 H-185.942 . Each of these policies ensure that physicians can specify the appropriate quantity of a 30 prescription drug and that insurers must have a specific process in place when exceptions to the 31 typically dispensed amount needs to be altered due to a medical reason. Policy H -120.962 32 specifically addresses mail order pharmacies and outlines when a 90- day prescript ion may not be 33 appropriate; during the initialization and dose stabilization of a new medication and when changing 34 the dosage of a long -term medication. Policy H -185.942 outlines AMA support for working with 35 insurers to ensure that there is an exceptions p rocess for patients that may need a higher or lower 36 dispensed amount of a medication due to a medical necessity and supports physician ability to limit 37 quantities of a prescription drug during initialization and dose stabilization of a new medication or 38 if the medication may pose a risk to patients. 39 40 In addition to policies related to the dispensing of prescription medications, the AMA has policy 41 related to limiting the overreach of pharmacists into medical decision -making. Of specific 42 relevance, Policy D -120.934 indicates AMA's intent to prohibit pharmacy actions that are 43 unilateral medical decisions and directs the AMA to implement polices that ensure prescriptions 44 are dispensed by pharmacists as ordered by the physician or prescriber, including the quantity 45 ordered. Policies D- 35.981 and D -35.987 more generally establish AMA's opposition to the 46 inappropriate practice of medicine by pharmacists. Policy D -35.981 confronts the \"intrusion\" of 47 pharmacy into medical practice. Policy D -35.987 outlines the AMA's intent to study, oppose, and 48 educate about inappropriate scope of practice expansions that would allow pharmacists to perform 49 services that constitute the practice of medicine, including opposition to laws that would allow 50 CMS Rep. 05- A-23 -- page 4 of 8 pharmacists to prescribe medicatio ns or to dispense medication beyond the expiration date of the 1 original prescription. 2 3 In addition, Policies H -115.967 and H -95.945 both outline the AMA's actions to promote 4 education, tracking, and packaging that prevents addiction, misuse, and harm. Spec ifically, Policy 5 H-115.967 focuses on introducing packaging for controlled substances that is more functional for 6 patients, improves patient adherence, and reduces the risk for misuse and abuse. Policy H -95.945 7 supports the permanency of and funding for the National All Schedules Prescription Electronic 8 Reporting and state/jurisdiction Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs. Additionally, the policy 9 outlines support for the availability of th ese data and the education of physicians on how to reduce 10 the misus e of prescription drugs. 11 12 Policies H -120.943 and H -120.952 state the AMA's work to ensure that the dispensed quantity of a 13 prescription drug is adequate for the patient, not overregulated, and not an undue burden on the 14 physician. Policy H -120.943 outlines the requirement for a medication that is dispensed for a 15 month and three -month supply and indicates the AMA's opposition to the arbitrary prescription 16 limits of medication for patients with pain related to cancer or a terminal illness. Similarly, Policy 17 H-120.952 opposes restriction to legitimate and clinically appropriate refills and encourages the 18 implementation of a prescription refill schedule. 19 20 DISCUSSION 21 22 In weighing the potential benefits and risks of dispensing a larger supply of medication, there is no 23 one correct answer for all patients. However, it is clear that physician s and patients should be able 24 to work collaboratively to make the correct choice for each individual patient. Further complicating 25 the issue are direction from PBMs and payers requiring or financially incentivizing the use of 26 certain PBM owned mail order pharmacies that only dispense 90 -day supplies of certain 27 medications. Th ese practices can lead to not only confusion and frustration for both physicians and 28 patients, but also can be potentially dangerous and expensi ve for patients. 29 30 Although r esearch has demonstrated benefits to dispensing 90 -day supplies of medications to 31 patients, the Council believes it is essential that the decision as to the quantity of medication 32 dispensed is one that is made within the patient -physician relationship, not by insurers, pharmacies, 33 or PBMs. The C ouncil also believes that the benefits of a 90- day supply are most prevalent for 34 maintenance medications that are stable and address chronic conditions. Although t he AMA has 35 policy to ensu re that the patient is able to receive the prescribed amount of a medication , as well as 36 policy that opposes the overreach of pharmacist practice, the Council believes that the language of 37 existing policy can be strengthened to ensure that the quantity of a medication dispensed remains a 38 decision made within the patient -physician relationship. 39 40 Therefore, the Council believes that the implementation of clear guidelines for physicians to 41 indicate that a prescription should be dispensed only as written are w arranted . These guidelines 42 could follow what have been implemented in states where physicians are able to write \"dispense 43 quantity as written,\" \"no change in quantity,\" or similar language to indicate the necessity of a 44 prescription being dispensed in a specific quantity. Additionally, the Council believes that Policy 45 H-185.942 which ensur es that physicians are able to specify the qu antity of a prescr iption 46 dispensed, can be strengthened with the addition of PBMs as a regulated party. Finally, the Council 47 believes that AMA policy on both ensuring the dispensing of adequate amounts of medication 48 without undue burden on the physician or patient and restricting the influence of PBMs and payers 49 are adequate and should be reaffirmed. 50 CMS Rep. 05-A-23 -- page 5 of 8 RECOMMENDATIONS 1 2 The Council on Medical Service recommends that the following be adopted in lieu of Resolution 3 237-A-22, and that the remainder of the report be filed: 4 5 1.

REPORT 08 OF THE COUNCIL ON MEDICAL SERVICE (A- 23) Impact of Integration and Consolidation on Patients and P hysicians (Reference Committee G) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY At the 2022 Interim meeting, the Council presented CMS Report 3, which was an informational report that provided background on the issue of health system consolidation . The next report in the Council's ongoing series on this topic is presented here and examines the i mpact of horizontal and vertical integration on health care prices and spending, patient access to care, quality of care, and physician wages and labor. This report also includes an overview of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justi ce (DOJ) merger review process and how physicians can play a role in preventing anticompetitive behavior and outcomes. This report specifically addresses the impact of hospital -hospital horizontal consolidation and hospital -physician practice vertical in tegration on physicians, patients, and local markets. An important distinction to make is that private equity investment in a hospital or a physician practice is not the same as vertical or horizontal integration, but instead is an issue of a change in ownership. While this is also a prevalent issue in health care, it is not the focus of this report. Both horizontally and vertically integrated health care entities may engage in a range of anticompetitive behaviors, including raising prices, excluding rival s, raising their costs, bargaining with health plans to demand higher prices for affiliated providers, and including anticompetitive terms in their contracts. This report examines the shared jurisdiction between the FTC and the DOJ in the merger and acqui sition process. Typically, the FTC reviews mergers between providers (hospitals, physician groups, etc.), while the DOJ reviews mergers between health insurance companies. DOJ has exclusive control over criminal enforcement. When examining a potential health care merger or acquisition, the FTC focus es on four areas: price effects, clinical quality effects, patient access, and provider wages. While evidence of impacts on health care prices and spending is stronger and more consistent, data on effects on patient access, changes in quality outcomes, and physician wages and workforce are insufficient to draw meaningful conclusions at this time . The Council recommends that the American Medical Association ( AMA) continue to monitor the impact of hospital- physician practice integration and hospital -hospital consolidation on health care prices and spending, patient access to care, potential changes in patient quality outcomes, and physician wages and labor, as well as the impact of non -compete clauses on physicians. The Council also recommends that the AMA broadly support efforts to collect relevant information on mergers and acquisitions in their state and/or region and work with state attorneys general (AG) to ensure proper review of these transactions before they occur. Finally, the Council recommends that the AMA support and encourage physicians to share their own experiences with mergers and acquisitions with the FTC through their online submission process. \u00a9 2023 American Medical Association.

REPORT OF THE COUNCIL ON MEDICAL SERVICE CMS Report 08- A-23 Subject: Impact of Integration and Consolidation on Patients and Physicians Presented by: Lynn Jeffers , MD, MBA, Chair Referred to: Reference Committee G At the 2022 Interim meeting, the Council presented CMS Report 3 which was informational and 1 provided background on the broad issue of health system consolidation. Consistent with Policy 2 D-215.984, which requested regular updates, this report examines the impact of horizontal and 3 vertical integration on health care prices and spending, patient access to care, quality of care, and 4 physician wage s and labor. This report also include s an overview of the Federal Trade Commission 5 (FTC) and the Department of Justice ( DOJ) merger review process and how physicians can play a 6 role in preventing anticompetitive behavior and outcomes. 7 8 BACKGROUND 9 10 It is important to distinguish the difference between horizontal integration and vertical integration . 11 A horizontal transaction often refers to a merger, purchase, or acquisition of an entity. Horizontal 12 integration (or consolidation ) reflects arrangements between entities that \"operate in a similar 13 position along the production process,\"1 meaning that they offer the same services and compete 14 with one another. One hospital acquiring or merging with another hospital would be considered 15 horizontal consolidation. Vertical integration reflects arrangements between entities that \"operate at 16 different points along the production process ,\"2 meaning that they do not directly compete with one 17 another. An example of this could be a hospital acqui ring a physician practice. For the purposes of 18 this report, hospital -hospital mergers will be referred to as horizontal consolidation, while hospital - 19 physician practice transactions will be referred to as vertical integration , although the latter may 20 also have horizontal aspects if the hospital already owned other physician practices before the 21 transaction . We note that mergers and acquisitions are complex economic issues and recognize that 22 there are many different types of transactions - and nuances within each of those transactions - but 23 the Council has chosen to focus on these two types of transactions for this report.3 24 25 HOSPITAL -PHYSICIAN INTEGRATION AND HOSPITAL -HOSPITAL CONSOLIDATION 26 27 This report specifically addresses the impact of hospital -hospital horizontal consolidation and 28 hospital -physician vertical integration on physicians, patients, and local markets. At the onset, an 29 important distinction to make is that private equity investment in a hospital or a physician practice 30 is not the same as vertical or horizontal integration, but instead is an issue of a change in 31 ownership. Recently there has also been an uptick in the number of physicians employed by 32 corporate -owned or publicly traded practices (i.e., CVS, Amazon). While these are also prevalent 33 issues in health care, they are not the focus of this report, and we would encourage members to 34 reference CMS Report 2 -I-22, Corporate Practice of Medicine, for more information on this topic. 35 36 In the United States, 90 percent of Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) are considered 37 concentrated for hospital services, and 65 percent of MSAs are considered concentrated for 38 CMS Rep. 08- A-23 -- page 2 of 9 outpatient specialty care. Research suggests that the impact of hospital -hospital horizontal 1 consolidation includes higher pr ices for services, higher insurance premiums and consumer cost 2 sharing, lack of quality gains and decrements in the patient experience. Hospital markets are not the 3 only component of care delivery that is concentrated, with an estimated 39 percent of MSAs 4 considered concentrated for primary care physicians and 65 percent for specialty care. Rising 5 prices and reduced choice for patients are often the outcome following hospital -hospital 6 consolidation and/or hospital -physician integration.4 7 8 Vertically integr ated health care entities may engage in a range of potentially anticompetitive 9 behaviors, including raising price s, exclud ing rivals (or raising their costs ), bargaining with health 10 plans to demand higher prices for affiliated providers, and including anti competitive terms in their 11 contracts (such as restrictive covenants on employed physicians ).5 12 13 Although billions of dollars in COVID- 19 federal relief funds have been dispersed across the 14 health care industry, a majority of the funding has gone to large hospital systems . This has left 15 many independent physician practices to suffer reductions in patient visits and revenues, making 16 them vulnerable to hospital -physician practice vertical integration.6 The risks such transaction s 17 pose to patients include higher prices, increased spending, and reduced choice. The economic 18 impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on independent physician practices has accelerated pressure for 19 vertical integration between hospitals and physician practices. R emaining independent physician 20 practices are under financial strain due to the economic impact of the pandemic , and even those 21 who previously resisted acquisition face new pressure to sell to large hospital systems or private 22 equity investors for financial stability and survival.7 23 24 Data from the AMA's 2022 Physician Practice Benchmark Survey indicate s that physicians in 25 practices wholly owned by physicians have decreased from 60 percent to 47 percent from 2012 to 26 2022. Conversely, physicians in practices wholly or jointly owned by hospitals have increased from 27 23 percent to 31 percent over the same time period. In 2022, ten percent of physicians were directly 28 employed by or contracting with a hospital (up from six percent in 2012). While there are many 29 factors driving these changes, it is important to note the trends in physician practice ownership over 30 the last decade. 31 32 Impact on Health Care Prices and Costs 33 34 Evidence suggests that hospital -physician integration leads to higher hea lth care prices - including 35 higher hospital prices, percent higher physician prices, and 10- 20 percent higher total expenditures 36 per patient.8 Prices have been shown to increase in hospitals following such integration. The harms 37 of hospital -hospital consolidation also include higher prices for patients .9 38 39 There are several ways hospital -physician integration can increase health care prices. Thes e include 40 the addition of facility fees that hospitals can charge for outpatient services provided by acquired 41 physicians, increased market power when negotiating with payers, and direct referrals of captive 42 physician practices to a greater extent than ind ependent physicians not related to the hospital 43 system , which could increase referrals to higher -cost providers and services.10 44 45 Generally, prices will ascend to the level a market will pay . If a certain entit y has market power , 46 prices can rise to offset r ising expenses and declining patient volume.11 According to a paper 47 prepared for Congress by economist s Martin Gaynor, Farzad Mostashari, and Paul B. Ginsburg 48 addressing horizontal consolidation of hospitals , hospitals without local competitors are estimated 49 to have prices nearly 16 percent higher on average than hospitals with four or more competitors, 50 which is a difference of nearly $2,000 per admission .12 A large body of economic literature 51 CMS Rep. 08- A-23 -- page 3 of 9 summarized by Gaynor in 2021 found substantial increases in hospital prices as a result of hospital - 1 hospital consolidation. Increases are widely seen, but vary significantly, from three percent to 65 2 percent . A 20 19 study by Cooper et al., found an average price increase of six percent as a result of 3 hospital me rgers, and Arnold and Whaley (2020) found an average price increase of 3.9 4 percent .13,14,15,16 5 6 Impact on Patient Access to Care 7 8 Current data on the impact hospital -physician integration has on patient access to care is limited , 9 making this issue one to continue to monitor . Nonetheless, t he Council is concerned that vertical 10 integration may lead to a more difficult environment for the remaining physician- owned practices 11 in terms of competition and referral steering. To the extent that consolidation may na rrow networks 12 or make areas harder for new practices to enter, this may have the effect o f reducing patient choice. 13 Thus far, there have only been two peer reviewed studies that examined the effect of vertical 14 integration of hospitals and physician practic es on access to care.17 15 16 Increased vertical integration in health care could also potentially reduce consumer choice by 17 creating larger, exclusive networks and driving patients and health plans to pay higher prices. Data 18 does not yet indicate that t hese higher costs and reductions in choice among independent providers 19 are offset by higher quality or efficiency from improved care coordination. As vertical integration 20 continues to occur , states are increasingly searching for ways to curb the rising costs and loss of 21 choices .18 22 23 Data on the impact of hospital -hospital consolidation are also limited. Th ere have been two recent 24 studies that examine the effect of consolidation on rural hospitals specifically, but there is no 25 conclusive data on other markets. Henke et al., (2021) found that merged rural hospitals were more 26 likely than independent hospitals to eliminate maternal, neonatal, and surgical care services. There 27 was also a decrease in the number of mental health and substance use disorder -related stays. 28 However, there is an important caveat to consider: without a merger a rural hospital may be forc ed 29 to close and even limited services would be eliminated from a community entirely.19,20 Similarly, 30 O'Hanlon et al. ( 2019), found that rural hospitals that became affiliated with integrated health 31 systems experienced a significant reduction in diagnostic imaging technologies, obstetric and 32 primary service availability, and outpatient nonemergency visits.21,22 While these results could be 33 an early indication of a trend following hospital -hospital consolidation, more evidence is needed 34 before conclusions can be drawn. For more information on Rural Health Care, please see CMS 35 Report 9- A-23. 36 37 Impact on Quality of Care 38 39 Empirical studies examining the effect of vertical integration of hospitals and physician practices 40 on quality of care showed mixed effects.23 Findings from two studies suggest no effects on quality 41 of care while two other studies using data from the American Hospital Association (AHA) found 42 mixed effects. The findings of the studies using AHA data sugg est that organizations that are fully 43 clinically integrated had small positive effects on some measures of quality while arrangements 44 that were not fully clinically integrated had no effect on the quality of care.24 45 46 Studies on hospital -hospital consolida tion on quality of care are also inconclusive. Some have 47 found no change in the quality of care while others have shown a decrease in the quality of care. A 48 2020 study by Beaulieu et al ., examined 246 hospital mergers between 2007 and 2016 and found 49 that r elative to similar hospitals that did not experience a merger, hospitals acquired in a merger 50 saw no significant differential change in 30 -day readmission rate and 30- day mortality rate in the 51 CMS Rep. 08- A-23 -- page 4 of 9 Medicare population. Interestingly, patient experience measures declined. However, it is important 1 to note that the association between mergers and declines in patient experience does not necessarily 2 imply causality; other factors may be in play . Therefore, one should be cautious in the 3 interpretation of those findings. Additionally, i t is important to note that data on the impact of 4 integration and consolidation on quality is meaningless without clearly defined quality metrics.25,26 5 6 Impact on Physicians 7 8 The AMA has long supported physician- led care teams and physician supervision of non- 9 physicians . When either hospital -physician integration or hospital -hospital consolidation occur s, 10 motives may shift to focus on profit and physicians may be replaced with non- physician 11 practitioners in an effort to achieve cost savings . However, emerging data suggests that a provider 12 mix (i.e., the number of physicians vs. non- physician practitioners) shift occurs in the years 13 following a merger or acquisition, with physicians being replaced by non- physicians to lower costs 14 and increase profits. Emerging data suggest shifting more patients to non- physician practitioners 15 could ultimately increase cost and simultaneously decrease quality of care. 16 17 Available data from recent studies on the impact of vertical integration on health care wages and 18 labor supply are limited , insufficient , and ultimately, inconclusive . In terms of compensation, a 19 2021 study by Whaley, Arnold, et.al ., found that ownership of a physician 's practice by a hospital 20 or health system was associated with lower income among physicians overall .27,28 As with the data 21 on patient access to care, further evidence is needed to conclusively determine the impact of 22 hospital -physician integration on health care wages and labor market changes.29 There are even 23 fewer studies available on the effect of hospital -hospital consolidation on physician wages. There is 24 some evidence that nurses ' and pharmacists ' wages decrease following a hospital merger, but there 25 is no significant data on the impact on physician wages.30 26 27 On January 5, 2023, the FTC proposed a rule to ban future noncompete clauses and invalidate 28 existing agreements. In the proposed rule, the FTC stated that noncompete clauses depress worker 29 wages and limit competition. Typically, a noncompete clause would bar a physician from 30 practicing medicine for a certain period of time within a defined geographic area or specific mile 31 radius. FTC regulators argue that noncompete clauses stifle competition and cause price increases 32 for patients in markets that are highly concentrated, as many health care markets are in the United 33 States. Critics question whether this proposed rule is within the purview of the FTC. One of those 34 critics is the AHA, which stated in its commen ts that \" the proposed regulation errs by seeking to 35 create a one- size-fits-all rule for all employees across all industries, especially because Congress 36 has not granted the FTC the authority to act in such a sweeping manner. Even if the FTC had the 37 legal a uthority to issue this proposed rule, now is not the time to upend the health care labor 38 markets with a rule like this.\"31 The public comment period for this proposed rule was open until 39 April 19, 2023.32 At the time of writing, AMA comments were still being prepared. T he Council 40 will continue to monitor the issue and its impact on physicians. 41 42 OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT 43 44 There is shared jurisdiction between the FTC and the DOJ when reviewing mergers and 45 acquisitions. Typically, the FTC reviews merg ers between providers (hospitals, physician groups, 46 etc.), while the DOJ reviews mergers between health insurance companies. DOJ has exclusive 47 control over criminal enforcement. 48 49 The FTC, DOJ, and private parties suffering antitrust injury use the Clayton Act, the Sherman Act, 50 and in the case of the FTC, the FTC Act to enforce antitrust laws. The Sherman Act of 1890 is the 51 CMS Rep. 08-A-23 -- page 5 of 9 US antitrust law which prescribes the rule of free competition among those engaged in commerce. 1 Importantly, the Sherman Act does not prohibit every restraint of trade, only those that are 2 unreasonable. Certain acts are considered so harmful to competition that they are almost always 3 illegal under the Sherman Act. These include plain arrangements among competing individuals or 4 businesses to fix prices, divide markets or rig bids. The Clayton Act of 1914 addresses specific 5 practices that are not directly addressed by the Sherman Act, including mergers. Specifically, 6 Section 7 of the Clayton Act prohibits mergers and acquisitions where the e ffect \"may be 7 substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly.\" The Clayton Act was amended in 8 1976 by the Hart- Scott -Rodino Act, which purposely exempts small transactions (valued at less 9 than $111.4 million as of February 27, 2023 ) from pre -merger notification to not increase the 10 regulatory burden on small enterprises in addition to avoiding generating unnecessary transactions 11 for FTC staff to review. This threshold is adjusted annually and results in many health system , 12 hospital and/or physician mergers proceeding without FTC and/or DOJ review. 13 14 Another hurdle contributing to increases in consolidation in recent years is FTC constraints on its 15 ability to enforce antitrust laws in the not- for-profit health care sector. Vertical integratio n is 16 particularly challenging for the FTC to monitor because it is often the result of hospitals acquiring 17 many smaller practices and each of those transactions may fall under the $ 111.4 million threshold 18 of having to notify the FTC. Additionally, the FTC has raised concerns about its inability to 19 enforce antitrust rules on most non -profit organizations, including most non- profit hospitals. The 20 FTC can only enforce Section 5 of the FTC Act against persons, partnerships, or corporations. 21 \"Corporations\" are defined as those entities organized to carry on business for-profit. Accordingly, 22 the FTC Act does not give the FTC the ability to enforce Section 5 against most non -profit entities , 23 which constitute the vast majority of hospitals. 24 25 The Council met with representatives from the FTC to discuss the process of reviewing mergers 26 and acquisitions. When examining a potential merger or acquisition, FTC staff focus on four areas: 27 price effects, clinical quality effects, patient access, and provider wages. When a pro posed merger 28 filing comes in, FTC staff have 30 days to decide whether or not to issue a challenge. If a challenge 29 is issued, the deal is prohibited from closing until further investigations are completed. During 30 these investigations, the merging entities may negotiate further to receive the approval of the FTC, 31 or the case could go to court. Alternatively, the two merging entities may decide to abandon the 32 deal altogether. 33 34 The representatives from FTC stressed the importance of physicians as the best adv ocates for 35 patients, especially regarding mergers between health care facilities. FTC staff time is limited, 36 especially given the quick timeline in which the FTC must decide whether or not to challenge a 37 merger , so input from impacted communities is helpfu l in flagging potential concerns. Information 38 shared by physicians is used by the FTC when evaluating potential mergers and acquisitions and is 39 immensely helpful in providing a voice for physicians and patients who would be impacted most. 40 The FTC encourages physicians to share their experience via email to the following address which 41 is monitored regularly by staff: antitrust@ftc.gov . Physicians are encouraged to work with their 42 state medical associations and/or state attorneys general (AG) to report mergers or acquisitions that 43 fall below the FTC threshold for review. Alternatively, physicians (or any member of the public) 44 are welcome to report potential antitrust violations to the FTC here: 45 https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/report- antitrust -violation . 46 47 In 2020, the FTC and DOJ published, and the FTC subsequently withdrew, revised Vertical Merger 48 Guidelines. After withdrawing the guidelines because they cited \"unsound economic theories \" the 49 FTC stated that it will continue working with the DOJ Antitrust Division to update merger 50 guidance to better reflect market realities. Updated Vertical Merger Guidelines are ex pected in 51 CMS Rep. 08- A-23 -- page 6 of 9 2023. Physicians are strongly encouraged to review these guidelines when they are available and 1 provide comments during the public comment period. 2 3 State s also have a critical role in oversight because vertical integration transactions often fly under 4 the radar of federal antitrust agencies because they tend to be too small in size to be reported under 5 the Hart -Scott -Rodino Act , which has a threshold of $111.4 million in 2023. States can be 6 proactive in the merger process by data gathering using a ll-payer claims databases, pre- transaction 7 review and approval, oversight of vertically integrated entities, and controlling outpatient costs 8 (i.e., restrictions on facility fees to counteract private -equity based acquisitions ).33 States can study 9 the price, utilization, or referral effects of vertical transaction s; detect targets for enforcement; 10 provide oversight of vertically integrated entities; plan and assess the need for new and additional 11 services; quantify the amount of facility fees charged; enforce compliance with surprise out -of- 12 network billing rules; or implement global budgets. Many states already require hospitals to notify 13 state officials of proposed mergers or acquisitions; however, states could expand the requirement to 14 transactions inv olving physicians. One example of this is in Washington state, which passed a law 15 in 2019 to require notification to the state AG of health care transactions, including those involving 16 \"provider organizations,\" below the Hart -Scott -Rodino threshold. Connec ticut requires 30-day 17 notice ] to the AG and the head of the Office of Health Strategy of any proposed transaction 18 involving a physician practice of eight or more physicians . In Massachusetts, all provider 19 organizations must provide the AG, the Health Polic y Commission, and the Center for Health 20 Information Analysis with a 60- day notice of any mergers, acquisitions, or affiliations. Unlike the 21 FTC, state AGs can regulate transactions involving nonprofit entities.34 22 23 AMA POLICY 24 25 The AMA has long- standing pol icy emphasizing the importance of competition in health care 26 markets and striving to protect physician autonomy and well -being before, during, and after health 27 care mergers and acquisitions (H -215.960, H -215.969). 28 29 Policy D -215.984 states that the AMA wil l study nationwide health system and hospital 30 consolidation in order to assist policymakers and the federal government in assessing health care 31 consolidation for the benefit of patients and physicians who face an existential threat from health 32 care consolidation; and regularly review and report back on these issues to keep the House of 33 Delegates apprised on the relevant changes that may impact the practice of medicine. Furthermore, 34 Polic y D-383.980 affirms that the AMA will study the potential effects of monopolistic activity by 35 health care entities that may have a majority of market share in a region on the patient -doctor 36 relationship; and develop an action plan for legislative and regul atory advocacy to achieve a more 37 vigorous application of antitrust laws to protect physician practices which are confronted with 38 potentially monopolistic activity by health care entities. 39 40 DISCUSSION 41 42 In general, e mpirical evidence is emerging on the impact of vertical integration on patients, 43 physicians, and health care. While evidence of impacts on health care prices and spending is 44 stronger and more consistent, evidence on effects on patient access, changes in quality outcomes, 45 and physician wages and workforce are insufficient to draw meaningful conclusions at this time. 46 However, research continues to be conducted, such as on the effects of hospital -physician 47 integration on quality as well as on the potential mechanisms underlying its effects on prices and 48 spending, especially as this and other acquisitions of physician practices become more common 49 The Council will continue to stay informed of new data and resear ch and will address future policy 50 recommendations as needed. 51 CMS Rep. 08- A-23 -- page 7 of 9 As data continue to be collected and vertical integration involving physicians continues to occur 1 regularly, p hysicians should work with their state medical associations who in turn should work 2 with their state attorneys general and state legislators to address these transactions. Potential state 3 policy solutions include notification of health care transactions to public officials and pre - 4 transaction review by states for those mergers and acquisitions that fall under the FTC/DOJ review 5 threshold. Flagging these transactions will allow time to review the impacts each would have on 6 the patients and physicians within a community and broader market concentration effects in the 7 impacted areas. 8 9 When meeting with representative s from the FTC, it was repeatedly stressed that the most 10 important thing physicians can do regarding concerning mergers and acquisitions is to share 11 individual perspectives on how consolidation has impacted their practice, their patients, and their 12 communi ty. When published, physicians should review the FTC's update to the Vertical Merger 13 Guidelines and provide feedback during the public comment period. 14 15 The Council believes that changes in provider mix and wages following a merger or acquisition is 16 an iss ue that should be monitored closely but that peer -reviewed data on the topic is not yet robust 17 enough for policy recommendations at this time. Similarly, the Council believes that mergers or 18 acquisitions may impact access and quality of care and will conti nue to monitor this data as it 19 becomes available. 20 21 The recommendations presented in this report are more actionable and supersede the 22 recommendations in Policy D -215.984, Health System Consolidation. T hus, we recommend that 23 policy be rescinded with the adoption of the following recommendations . 24 25 RECOMMENDATIONS 26 27 The Council on Medical Service recommends that the following recommendations be adopted, and 28 the remainder of the report be filed: 29 30 1. That our Ameri can Medical Association ( AMA) continue to monitor the impact of 31 hospital -physician practice and hospital -hospital mergers and acquisitions on health care 32 prices and spending, patient access to care, potential changes in patient quality outcomes, 33 and physic ian wages and labor . (New HOD Policy) 34 35 2. That our AMA continue to monitor how provider mix may change following mergers and 36 acquisitions and how non- compete clause s may impact patients and physicians . (New 37 HOD Policy) 38 39 3. That our AMA broadly supp ort efforts to collect relevant information regarding hospital - 40 physician practice and hospital -hospital mergers and acquisitions in state s or region s that 41 may fall below the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) /Department of Justice review 42 threshold.

REPORT 09 OF THE COUNCIL ON MEDICAL SERVICES (A -23) Federally Qualified Heath Centers and Rural Health Care (Reference Committee G) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This report, initiated by the Council, provides information and background on Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and similar clinics serving areas of medical need. Additionally, the report discusses the importance of these centers to providing essential health care and the physician experience for those who work in these settings. The report also details relevant American Medical Association ( AMA) policy and provides recommendations to ensure that these clinics are maintained and that physicians are able to practice without undue burden. The Council understands that FQHCs and similar clinics serving areas of medical need are a key aspect of the AMA's existing advocacy to reduce health care disparities in rural communities through increasing access t o health care services. The AMA has a robust body of policy and advocacy efforts supporting general efforts to improve health care in rural communities. To fully support the health care services provided in these clinic settings, the Council discusses the importance of maintaining funding streams, reducing physician administrative burden, and ensuring that all care provided is overseen by a physician. In order to maintain the feasibility of FQHCs and similar health centers, it is important that a continued investment be made by the federal government as FQHCs receive a majority of funding through grants from the federal government. These grants allow these health services to be delivered to communities that would otherwise face significant barriers to access. In addition to ongoing funding, it is important that the regulating bodies of these health centers ensure that the certification and operating regulations do not place undue burdens on the physicians practicing in these settings. Physicians nationwide ar e faced with significant administrative work and those practicing in settings like FQHCs may face even more daunting administrative tasks . Finally, to ensure that these underserved communities receiv e high quality health care, it is important that all care be overseen by physicians . Oversight regarding physician supervision must be maintained to guarantee that all communities served by FQHCs, and similar health centers receive high -quality health care. The Council recommends adoption of two new policies, one advocat ing for clear certification requirements and other policies that reduce the administrative burden on physicians practicing in FQHCs, and a second supporting federal funding to maintain costs associated with operating these health centers. In addition to these two new policies , the Council recommends reaffi rming existing AMA policy that support s the implementation of programs to improve rural communities' health, H-465.994, advocates for the authorization of Chronic Care Management reimbursement for physicians, D -390.923, and limit s the scope of practice for nonphysician providers without supervision of a physician, H -160.947 and H -35.965.\u00a9 2023 American Medical Association.

REPORT OF THE COUNCIL ON MEDICAL SERVICE CMS Report 09- A-23 Subject: Federally Qualified Health Centers and Rural Health Care Presented by: Lynn Jeffers , MD, MBA Chair Referred to: Reference Committee G Adequately addressing the issues that contribute to poor health outcomes and significant disparities 1 for those who live in rural communities continues to be challenging . Approximately 14 percent of 2 Americans liv e in a rural area, representing approximately 46 million people .1 The health 3 disparities for rural Americans are quite stark, as these communities tend to be poorer, older, 4 sicker, and die at a 50 percent higher rate from unintentional injury .2 One contributing factor to 5 these dispari ties is the lack of accessible health care facilities and physicians. Approximately 66 6 percent of all Primary Care Health Professional Shortage Areas are in rural communities, 7 indicating a disproportionately high lack of access to care3. Additionally, thos e in rural areas are 8 geographically further from hospitals and physicians, increasing barriers to access care3. Although 9 the American Medical Association ( AMA ) has robust existing policy regarding improving the 10 health of rural America, there is limited po licy directly related to the centers that serve these 11 populations. 12 13 This report , initiated by the Council , provides information and background on Federally Qualified 14 Health Centers (FQHCs) and similar clinics serving areas of medical need. Additionally, t he report 15 discusses the importance of these centers to providing essential health care and the physician 16 experience for those who work in these settings. The report also details relevant AMA policy and 17 provides recommendations to ensure that these clinics are funded adequately and that physicians 18 are able to practice without undue burden . 19 20 BACKGROUND 21 22 Although r ural communities are o ften woefully underserved, FQHCs and Rural Health Clinics 23 (RHCs) are two types of practices working to bring additional care to these communities. While 24 FQHCs do not exclusively serve rural communities, many do serve these areas. FQHCs are health 25 centers t hat serve communities, regardless of population density, that are designated health care 26 shortage areas. These clinics are unique in that they not only provide medical care services, but 27 also wraparound and social services. RHCs are clinics that serve desi gnated health care shortage 28 areas that are also considered rural. These clinics provide health care services to their communities, 29 and may, but are not required to, provide social support services. FQHCs and RHCs are similar in 30 many ways but do have distinct differences with RHCs only serving rural communities and FQHCs 31 providing services beyond the traditional health care paradigm. Each of these centers work to 32 provide health care to communities that are in desperate need and , in turn, help to mitigate hea lth 33 care disparities. 34 CMS Rep. 09-A-23 -- page 2 of 13 Federally Qualified Health Centers 1 2 As previously noted, FQHC s are health care center s that provide health care services to rural or 3 urban shortage areas. FQHCs are often the last line of care for individuals who otherwise may go 4 without health care services. These practices are a central location for patients to receive 5 coordinated preventive care and disease management. FQHCs provide medical services and are 6 often able to support patients in accessing dental, social , and mental health services. These centers 7 are vital for the communities they serve by providing care to approximately 30 million people in 8 over 1,400 locations across the country.3 Not only are the communities served by FQHCs often 9 underserved, but they are also often underinsured. Approximately 59 percent of patients at FQHCs 10 are insured publicly and 20 percent are uninsured.3,4 These centers are vital in rural communities, 11 with nearly half (4 5 percent ) of all centers serving rural communities where they are, if not the 12 only, one of very few sources of health care services.4 13 14 These health centers were originally created in 1965 by President Lyndon B. Johnson as an element 15 of his administration 's \"War on Poverty.\" These centers were initially called community health 16 centers and operated in a semi-permanent capacity for about a decade. In 1975, these health centers 17 were officially authorized as a permanent program with their incorporation in section 330 of the 18 Public Health Services (PHS) Act. After gaining permanency , the program continued to receive 19 bipartisan support and was continually funded by Congress. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, 20 FQHCs were established as a part of Medicare and Medicaid and were given a $150 million 21 increase in funding. The following decade brought additional funding increases and reauthorization 22 for FQHCs via effort s by Congress and the A dministration. In 2009, $2 billion was invested in 23 FQHCs through the reauthorization of Children's Health Insurance Program and the American 24 Recovery and Reinvestment Act. An additional funding increase was earmarked in 2011 with the 25 passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) . However, in the same year a significant budget deficit 26 tempered the initially indicated $11 billion investment and slowed the expansion of FQHCs. Over 27 the next decade, FQHCs continued to receive funding through re authorizations and , both directly 28 and indirectly, the implementation of the ACA in 2014. More recently, FQHCs faced significant 29 challenges, as did all of health care, in battling the COVID -19 pandemic. In 2021, the American 30 Rescue Plan was enacted and FQHC s received approximately $7.6 billion through a variety of 31 different programs. 5 Notably , FQHCs provided care to 30 million Americans in 2021, indicating 32 their vital place in the landscape of American health care. 33 34 In practice, F QHCs are diverse in the services they provide to their patients, with some providing 35 expanded services like mental and behavioral health, but at the core they all meet the basic 36 definition of providing at least primary care services to rural or urban shortage areas. Within these 37 types of practices, clinics fall under one of three categories, a health center program grantee, a 38 \"look- alike \" program , or an Outpatient Triba l facility. Health center program grantees are what are 39 traditionally referred to as an FQHC. Along with meeting a host of eligibility requirements, i n 40 order to receive this designation, the center must receive a grant under section 330 of the PHS Act. 41 FQHC \"look- alike\" clinics are those that meet many of the same eligibility requirements as the 42 aforementioned health center program grantees, but do not receive grants or funding from section 43 330 of the PHS Act. Finally, Outpatient Tribal facilities are simil ar, in that they meet many of the 44 same requirements as a PHS Act granted FQHC ; however, they are operated by a tribe, tribal 45 organization, or urban Indian organization. These clinics are funded through either the Indian Self- 46 Determination Act or Title V of the Indian Health Improvement Act. In specific circumstances 47 these clinics are able to be grandfathered in and may not meet each of the eligibility requirements 48 of FQHCs or \"look- alikes\". 6 In the remainder of this report the use of the term FQHC will be 49 inclusive of each of these three types of clinics, unless specifically distinguished. Clinics that are 50 classified as FQHCs serve a wide variety of patients and can be seen across the country referred to 51 CMS Rep. 09- A-23 -- page 3 of 13 as organizations li ke, Community Health Centers, Migrant Health Centers, Health Care for the 1 Homeless Health Centers, and Public Housing Primary Care Centers.6 2 3 In order to be designated a FQHC, a center must meet a multitude of practice requirements . 4 Specifically, care mu st be provided by a physician, nurse practitioner (NP), physician assistant 5 (PA), certified nurse midwife (CNM ), clinical psychologist , clinical social worker, or a certified 6 diabetes self -management training/medical nutrition therapy provider. FQHCs must be under the 7 medical direction of a physician, but each of the previously mentioned nonphysician practitioners 8 are able to independently see patients. When seeing a patient, the visit must be deemed either 9 medically necessary or a qualified preventive heal th visit. Visits generally occur at the health center 10 but may take place in the patient's residence if the patient is home -bound.6 Traditionally, these 11 visits were required to occur in person and face- to-face, however during the COVID -19 Public 12 Health Emer gency , exceptions were made for increased telehealth visits. These exceptions have 13 been extended beyond the end of the health emergency and will allow for practitioners to continue 14 to see some patients virtually . 15 16 While FQHCs provide a diverse range of services that vary from clinic to clinic, there are a core set 17 of services that must be offered in order to receive a FQHC certification. Required services include 18 primary health services like family medicine, interna l medicine, pediatric, and obstetrics and 19 gynecology care. FQHCs are required to provide diagnostic lab ser vices, preventive health 20 services, emergency medical services, and referrals. FQHCs are also required to provide dental 21 screenings to determine if further dental care is needed and while some may have an on -site dentist, 22 full dental care is not a requirement. Additionally, FQHCs are required to provide supplemental 23 services to enable access to care, like transportation, and community education. While n ot required, 24 FQHCs may also provide care including pharmaceutical services ( e.g., pharmacies and/or drug 25 monitoring) , behavioral and mental health ser vices, environmental health services, screening and 26 control of infectious diseases, and/or injury preventi on programs .6 In short, the medical services 27 provided by an FQHC are designed to allow for a \"one stop shop\" mentality where patients are able 28 to receive care for a variety of needs. 29 30 In addition to the medically centered requirements of an FQHC, there ar e also more administrative 31 requirements that must be met. These clinics must demonstrate effective procedures for tracking, 32 compiling, and reporting operating costs and patterns of service use as well as the availability, 33 accessibility, and acceptability o f services offered. These records should be provided to the 34 governing body upon request. Additionally, the FQHC must complete and file an annual 35 independent financial audit with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. 36 Regarding payment, FQHCs must have a contracted agreement with the s tate for those who are 37 eligible for state insurance plans and encourage patients to participate in any insurance plan for 38 which they are eligible. These centers are also responsible for collecting appropr iate payment from 39 patients through an established sliding scale fee/payment plan. Finally, they must ensure that no 40 patient is turned away from receiving services due to the lack of ability to pay .6 41 42 FQHC governance board s must be comprised of a majority (51 percent +) of individuals who 43 receive care at the clinic, and must meet at least once a month. Additional ongoing quality 44 improvement processes must be continuous and include both clinical services and management 45 operati ons. Additionally, FQHCs must have established continuing referral relationships with at 46 least on e hospital and mu st demonstrate continued efforts to establish and maintain relationships 47 with other health care providers in the area .6 48 49 Any patient can be s erved at an FQHC, regardless of insurance status or ability to pay. While some 50 FQHCs have a more specified focus, for example a migrant population, there is no restriction on 51 CMS Rep. 09-A-23 -- page 4 of 13 who they are able to provide care for. To ensure that the services offered are geographically 1 accessible, clinics must regularly review the size of their catchment area and adjust if needed. 2 Whenever possible, these boundaries should conform with existing local boundaries and work to 3 eliminate any geographical barriers. FQHCs must oper ate in an area that has been designated as a 4 Medically U nderserved A rea (MUA) or with a population that has been designated a medically 5 underserved population. Should the clinic operate in an area in which a \"substantial portion\" of the 6 community are limit ed-English speakers, there are specific cultural and language requirements that 7 must be met. Clinics in these areas must ensure that services are provided in the language and 8 cultural context that is appropriate for the community. Additionally, the clinic must employ at least 9 one staff member who is fl uent in the language dominant in the community and English in order to 10 provide assistance in bridging cultural or linguistic differences.6 11 12 The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent vaccination campaign highlighte d the importance of 13 FQHCs in delivering care to those who are underserved, underrepresented, and underinsured. The 14 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation's Office of Health Policy's research 15 report investigating the barriers and faci litators in COVID -19 vaccine outreach indicated the 16 widespread success of FQHCs in delivering high rates of vaccination in the communities they 17 serve. Specifically, 62 percent of FQHCs held vaccination events or mobile clinics in their 18 communities, distrib uting 14+ million doses of the vaccine to communities. Importantly, these 19 FQHCs were not only successful in vaccinating their communities, but 66 percent of vaccinations 20 were given to people of color, supporting work to decrease health disparities.7 In a more specific 21 example, an FQHC, Proteus, serving primarily H2-A visa workers in Iowa, Nebraska, and Indiana, 22 set up an innovative program to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. In a non- COVID year the 23 FQHC provides these farm workers with preventive health care and training on topics like heat 24 stress and pesticide safety. When the pandemic arose, this model was modified to include infection 25 mitigation training for the workers and farm owners, COVID testing, providing personal protective 26 equipment, housing, virtual town halls, and contact tracing. As most of the H2- A visa workers were 27 Spanish-speaking, this work was all done in a bilingual and culturally responsive fashion. This 28 program was able to mitigate the spread of COVID while the workers were in the United States, 29 when they went to their home country, and when they returned to the United States for the 30 subsequent agricultural season .8 31 32 However, the success of FQHCs providing care to underserved communities is not limited to 33 COVID. FQHCs across the country provide care to individuals who are in underserved 34 communities, with 62 percent of patients reporting being a person of color. One specific example is 35 a FQHC, Dartmouth Geisel Migrant Health Center, that serves primarily Latino patients in the 36 Northeast United States. It was found that the work done by this FQHC, especially around care 37 coordination and interpreter services, improved the access to care for the community they served.9 38 These examples demonstrate the power of FQHCs to support communities in not only times of 39 crisis, like a pandemic, but in everyday health care needs. These centers are vital to providing 40 health care services to the communities they serve. 41 42 Rural Health Cl inics 43 44 While RHCs are similar to FQHCs in many ways, there are some key differences. Most 45 significantly, RHCs only serve rural areas and populations. Similar to FQHCs , RHCs can vary in 46 type, from indepe ndent, hospital -based, or provider- based centers. The se clinics are designed to 47 increase the accessibility of primary care in areas that are underserved due to their rural status . 10,11 48 49 As a point of clarification, although RHCs and rural hospitals may sound similar in name, they are 50 two separate types of practice. They face distinct differences in financial support, eligibility, and 51 CMS Rep. 09- A-23 -- page 5 of 13 operating requirements. To avoid confusion, rural hospitals will not be included in the current 1 report. A recent repor t from the Council (Council on Medical Service Report 9- J-21) addressed 2 rural hospitals. 3 4 RHC services are provided by a physician, NP, PA, or CNM and must be under the medical 5 direction of a physician. RHCs are required t o have a NP, PA, or CNM providing care services at 6 least half of the time the center is open. These centers are required to provide pr imary care and 7 routine diagnostic and lab services and, while not required, may provide other types of services 8 such as Transitional Care Management, General Behavioral Health Integration, Chronic Care 9 Management, Princip al Care Management, and Psychiatric Collaborative Care Management. 10 Although these clinics are able to provide behavioral and mental health serves, they cannot be 11 designated as a rehabilitatio n agency or a primarily mental disease treatment facility. Patient visits 12 follow very similar requirements as an FQHC in that they must be medically necessary or a 13 qualified preventive health visit and can take place at the center, the patient's home, a sk illed 14 nursing facility, or hospice. Visits are not able to take place in an inpatient or outpatient hospital 15 department. Similar to FQHCs, visits were historically required to be in person, but the COVID -19 16 pandemic allowed for telehealth exceptions that h ave now been extended beyond the Public Health 17 Emergency.7,8 18 19 In order to meet the administrative requirements of RHC certification, centers must file annual cost 20 reports that include payment rates, reconcile interim payments, graduate medical education 21 adjustments, bad debt, and administrative payments. Payment is primarily made through a bundled 22 All-Inclusive Rate (AIR) that is determined for all qualified primary and preventive care services. 23 Dependent upon the patient's insurance status, a co -pay may be applied to the services. For 24 example, patients with Part B Me dicare coverage would pay for 20 percent of the AIR once their 25 deductible is met. These centers must also maintain a contractual agreement with at least one 26 hospital to provide services that are not available at the R HC.7,8 27 28 Unlike FQHCs there are no spec ific requirements related to the governanc e, quality improvement, 29 nor cultur e or language of pa tients. RHCs do have specific requirements related to their service 30 areas. T hese centers must serve a community that has been designated as a Primary Care 31 Geogra phic Health Professional Shortage Area, Primary Care Population -Group H ealth 32 Professional Shortage Area, MUA, or a governor -designated and secretary -certified shortage area. 33 Additionally, these communities must be designated as non -urbanized. Each year RHC s serve 34 approximately 7 million people throughout 47 states .8 35 36 While FQHCs and RHCs are mutually exclusive, they are similar in their basic mission which is to 37 provide health care to individuals who are underserved. There are also similarities in the type s of 38 health care providers and types of services permitted. One of the defining differences between the 39 two is the source of funding. FQHCs must receive funding via Section 330 of the PHS Act, while 40 RHC funding comes from alternative federal avenues, such as appropriations from the Centers for 41 Medicare & Medicaid Services. A full comparison outlining the certification requirements for 42 FQHCs and RHCs has been appended to this report. 43 44 PHYSICIAN EXPERIENCE IN FQHCs 45 46 Physicians who work in FQHC settings may experience unique benefits and challenges. While the 47 benefits of working in an FQHC are somewhat difficult to quantify, many physicians report that 48 their work is more gratifying than other settings and that they believe they are helping communities 49 that otherwise would not have adequate access to health care. There are also more tangible benefits 50 CMS Rep. 09- A-23 -- page 6 of 13 to working in an FQHC , such as student loan repayment programs and visas for foreign- born 1 physicians. 2 3 Although t hese specific benefits and the ability to serve communities that are desperate for quality 4 health care can provide physicians with a sense of fulfillment , there are significant challenges that 5 these physicians face working in FQHCs12. For example , working in an FQHC does not relieve the 6 physician burden of administrative paperwork. Serving a patient base that has higher rates of public 7 insurance means that physicians are spending more time dealing with the rules, protocols, and 8 paperwork associated with payment . The volumino us amount of paperwork that patients are 9 required to complete to register as an FQHC patient can frequently lead to disruptions in 10 scheduling and physicians spending significant amounts of time reviewing and signing the 11 paperwork. In addition to the increa sed administrative and regulatory burdens, since physicians at 12 FQHCs are operating in underserved areas it is often difficult to find reasonable timely referrals 13 and coordinate care for patients who may need advanced or specialty care. Some physicians who 14 work in FQHCs report feeling that they are practicing medicine without the support of a medical 15 team or other physicians. For physicians in these settings, providing care to their pa tients, who are 16 often facing complex medical conditions, can be a significant undertaking . Physicians practicing in 17 FQHCs are frequently part of a limited network of providers in the area they serve, leading to 18 increased stress and working hours in order t o attempt to provide quality care on a reasonable 19 timeline to the patients they serve .9,10 20 21 Finally, physicians working in FQHCs often have additional duties related to the supervision of 22 nonphysician providers, which adds another set of tasks to already full schedule s. FQHC 23 physicians report spending considerable time on weekends and evenings reviewing cases that are 24 handle d by the non- physician practitioners in order to remain in compliance with federal 25 regulations and provide quality care. Notably, phys icians working in FQHCs report 11 percent 26 higher burnout than their colleagues working in other practice settings .13 27 28 RELEVANT AMA POLICY 29 30 The AMA has a number of existing policies related to rural health and FQHCs . Many of the current 31 AMA policies related to rural health are centered around rural hospitals. Policies H -465.979 and 32 H-465.990 focus on the economic viability of rural hospitals. Each encourages efforts and 33 legislation to support these hospitals ' efforts to stay open and serve their communities. Polic y 34 D-465.998, established with Council on Medical Service Report 9 -J-21, and Policies H-240.971, 35 H-465.978, and H -240.970, all deal with the payment challenges that are faced by many rural 36 physicians and hospitals. The policies both recognize and offer potential solutions for remedying 37 the payment differentials between rural and urban medical care. Finally, Policies H-465.984, 38 H-465.996, and H -465.999 focus on the certification and regulations of rural health care centers 39 and hospitals. 40 41 The Council believes that, in conjunction with FQHCs and RHCs, rural hospitals are another vital 42 strategy to deliver care to rural communities. Notably , the Council's recent 2021 report, 43 \"Addressing Payment and Delivery in Rur al Hospitals\" ( Council on Medical Service Report 44 9-J-21) included policy recommendations that remain informative and relevant as to the current 45 state of rural hospitals in America. As previously noted, i n order to avoid confusion, th is current 46 report has remained focus ed on health care in non- hospital settings, like FQHCs and RHCs. 47 48 The AMA also has policies related to rural health care that are not centered solely around hospital 49 centered care. Policies H -465.994 and H -465.982 are concentrated around impr oving the health of 50 rural communities through promoting access to medical care. Policy H -465.978 works to recognize 51 CMS Rep. 09- A-23 -- page 7 of 13 and advocate for fixing the payment bias that is seen between rural and non -rural providers. The 1 policy advocates specifically for payment equity in telehealth legislation. Finally, Policy 2 H-465.980 supports the development and improvement of rural health networks to be centered 3 around the needs of the communities they serve. 4 5 With respect to FQHCs, Policy D -390.923 acknowledges the need for C hronic C are M anagement 6 payment for physicians who practice in FQHCs. Additionally, the AMA has exis ting policy 7 surrounding issues of scope of practice for non- physician providers. Specifically, Polic ies D - 8 35.989, H -160.947, and H -35.965 ensure the regulation of and appropriate scope (including 9 physician supervision) of midwives/CNMs, P As, NPs, and \"related medical personnel.\" 10 11 DISCUSSION 12 13 FQHCs are , by definition, located in areas where health care is hard to access. As previously 14 discussed , FQHCs were key in meeting the needs of communities that arose during the peak of the 15 COVID -19 pandemic . FQHCs also have a long history of working to reduce health care disparities 16 and providing preventive and primary care to the underserved.8,9 Although t he AMA has 17 established policy on improving the health of rural Americans, the Council believes that 18 strengthening our support of FQHCs is warranted . 19 20 One specific method to ensure the viability of FQHCs and RHCs is by reduc ing physician burnout, 21 one of the core tenets of the AMA's Recovery Plan for America's Physicians. B urnout is reported 22 at higher levels in physicians who practice in FQHCs ,10 with significant time and resource burdens 23 related to the administrative aspects of maintaining patient care .9,10 The Council believes that this is 24 a potential point of intervention via the addition of AMA policy to ensure that administrative 25 burdens placed on physicians practicing in these settings are not undue and do not influence levels 26 of burnout. 27 28 In addition to ensuring that physicians are able to continue practicing in FQHCs the Council 29 believes that it is also essential that the AMA advocate for continued federal support for these 30 practices. Existing funding for FQHCs should be maintained and increased when feasible to 31 support the expansion of existing clinics and founding of new clinics in underserved co mmunities. 32 The Council understands the importance of FQHCs in providing health care services for 33 communities that have limited access and believes that it is essential to support these clinics and 34 the physicians who practice in them. 35 36 Finally, in order to ensure that patients cared for in FQHCs are receiving high -quality medical care 37 services, it is important to ensure that care is always performed under the supervision of a 38 physician. While regulations for both FQHCs and RHCs allow for practitione rs like P As, NPs, and 39 CNMs to provide care, they do require the supervision of a physician. The AMA does have 40 existing policies that ensure support for state and local medical societies in identifying and 41 advocating for the existing requirement of physicia n oversight. Each of these additions and 42 reaffirmations of policy will ensure that the AMA works to support essential access points of care 43 for rural communities and the physicians who provide this care. 44 45 RECOMMENDATIONS 46 47 The Council on Medical Service recommends that the following be adopted and that the remainder 48 of the report be filed: 49 CMS Rep. 09- A-23 -- page 8 of 13 1. That our American Medical Association ( AMA) support certification requirements and 1 other policies that reduce the administrative burden for physicians practicing in Federally 2 Qualified Health Center ( FQHCs ). (New HOD Policy) 3 4 2. That our AMA support sufficient federal funding to maintain the operation and costs 5 associated with establishing and operating a FQH C, FQHC \" Look- Alike\", or Outpatie nt 6 Tribal Facility. (New HOD Policy) 7 8 3. That our AMA reaffirm Policy H -465.994, which supports efforts to develop and 9 implement proposals and programs to improve the health of rural communities. (Reaffirm 10 HOD Policy) 11 12 4. That our AMA reaffirm Policy D -390.923, which advocates for the authorization of 13 Chronic Care Management reimbursement for all physicians, including those practicing in 14 FQHCs or Rural Health Clinics . (Reaffirm HOD Policy) 15 16 5. That our AMA reaffirm Policies H -160.947 and H -35.965, which both advocate for the 17 support of state and local medical societies in identifying and working to prevent laws that 18 may allow for non-physician s (e.g., nurse practitioners, physician assistants ) to operate 19 without the supervision of a physician.

CMS Rep. 09-A-23 -- page 12 of 13 Appendix B AMA Policies Recommended for Reaffirmation Policy H-465.994, \"Improving Rural Health\" 1. Our AMA (a) supports continued and intensified efforts to develop and implement proposals for improving rural health care and public health, (b) urges phys icians practicing in rural areas to be actively involved in these efforts, and (c) advocates widely publicizing AMA's policies and proposals for improving rural health care and public health to the profession, other concerned groups, and the public. 2. Our AMA will work with other entities and organizations interested in public health to: Encourage more research to identify the unique needs and models for delivering public health and health care services in rural communities. Identify and disseminate concr ete examples of administrative leadership and funding structures that support and optimize local, community- based rural public health. Develop an actionable advocacy plan to positively impact local, community- based rural public health including but not limited to the development of rural public health networks, training of current and future rural physicians and public health professionals in core public health techniques and novel funding mechanisms to support public health initiatives that are led and man aged by local public health authorities. Advocate for adequate and sustained funding for public health staffing and programs. (Sub. Res. 72, I-88; Reaffirmed: Sunset Report, I-98; Policy D-390.923, \"Chronic Care Management Payment for Patients Also on Home Health\" Our AMA will advocate for the authorization of Chronic Care Management (CCM) reimbursement for all physicians, including those practicing in Rural Health Clinics and Federally Qualified Health Centers, for patients in a home health episode. (Res. 801, I -17) Policy H-160.947, \"Physician Assistants and Nurse Practitioners\" Our AMA will develop a plan to assist the s tate and local medical societies in identifying and lobbying against laws that allow advanced practice nurses to provide medical care without the supervision of a physician. The suggested Guidelines for Physician/Physician Assistant Practice are adopted to read as follows (these guidelines shall be used in their entirety): (1) The physician is responsible for managing the health care of patients in all settings. (2) Health care services delivered by physicians and physician assistants must be within the sco pe of each practitioner 's authorized practice, as defined by state law. (3) The physician is ultimately responsible for coordinating and managing the care of patients and, with the appropriate input of the physician assistant, ensuring the quality of healt h care provided to patients. (4) The physician is responsible for the supervision of the physician assistant in all settings. (5) The role of the physician assistant in the delivery of care should be defined through mutually agreed upon guidelines that are developed by the physician and the physician assistant and based on the physician 's delegatory style. (6) The physician must be available for consultation with the physician assistant at all times, either in person or through telecommunication systems or other means. (7) The extent of the involvement by the physician assistant in the assessment and implementation of treatment will depend on the complexity and acuity of the patient's condition and the training, experience, and preparation of the physician assistant, as adjudged by the physician. CMS Rep. 09- A-23 -- page 13 of 13 (8) Patients should be made clearly aware at all times whether they are being cared for by a physician or a physician assistant. (9) The physician and physician assistant together should review all delegated patient services on a regular basis, as well as the mutually agreed upon guidelines for practice. (10) The physician is responsible for clarifying and familiarizing the physician assistant with his/her supervising methods and style of delegating patient ca re.

( Res. 233, A-17; Modified: Res. 215, I -19) AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 701 (A-23) Introduced by: Medical Student Section Subject: Reconsideration of the Birthday Rule Referred to: Reference Committee G Whereas, Self -insured coverage is either a self -administered process or a third party 1 administrator where the employer collects premiums from enrollees and assumes 2 responsibility of paying employees' and dependents' medical claims1; and 3 4 Whereas, The Health Insurance Portability And Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), 5 established protections for \"self -insured\" and \"insured\" coverage, whereby newborns, 6 adopted children, and new parents not enrolled under a health plan could enroll under a 7 period of \"special enrollment\" upon the birth, adoption, or placement for adoption of a new 8 child2; and 9 10 Whereas, Under HIPAA, as long as enrollment occurs within 30 days of birth, health 11 insurance coverage is effective as of the date of birth and cannot be subject to pre- existing 12 condition exclusion2; and 13 14 Whereas, If a health plan's benefits are provided through an insurance company or Health 15 Maintenance Organization (HMO), state laws may amend HIPAA requirements to allow for 16 additional considerations; such as extending the enrollment period2; and 17 18 Whereas, The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) is the U.S. standard - 19 setting organization governed by the chief insurance regulators from all 50 states, the District 20 of Columbia, and five U.S. territories to coordinate regulation of multistate insurers3; and 21 22 Whereas, Coordination of Benefits (COB) as defined by the NAIC is the provision to eliminate 23 over-insurance and establish a prompt and orderly claims payment system when a person is 24 covered by more than one group insurance and/or group service plan1; and 25 26 Whereas, State law permits insurers to follow a COB to determine insurers' responsibilities 27 under an insurance claim in the event the \"insured\" is covered by more than one health plan, 28 in the identification of a \"primary\" and \"secondary\" benefit payer4; and 29 30 Whereas, Newborns of parents with separate insurance policies are subjected to a COB at 31 birth2,4; and 32 33 Whereas, The birthday rule is a COB model regulation set by the NAIC in which a newborn 34 takes as primary coverage the plan of the parent whose birthday comes first in the calendar 35 year2,4; and 36 37 Whereas, The recently publicized case of the Kjelshus family resulted in a $200,000 bill for a 38 NICU stay because the parents were unaware of their coordination of benefits, specifically 39 the birthday rule, that resulted in the father's inferior policy determining their child's insurance 40 Resolution: 701 (A-23) Page 2 of 5 coverage solely due to the fact of having a birthday only 2 weeks earlier than his spouse in 1 the calendar year5; and 2 3 Whereas, The birthday rule has led to confusion and frustration of parents when a child is 4 automatically enrolled under the parent with the earlier birthday in the calendar year without 5 considering the quality of insurance coverage between both parents, showing that simple 6 awareness is not enough to address the problem5,; and 7 8 Whereas, H.R.4636l, known as the Empowering Parents' Healthcare Choices Act of 2021, 9 currently in the House Subcommittee on Health, would give parents with dual policies 60 10 days before the birthday rule would take effect from the date of an infant's birth to choose 11 which plan is primary and to notify the insurer of their choice effectively reclaiming parental 12 choice6; therefore be it 13 14 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association support evidence -based legislation that 15 support a parent, or guardian's, choice of their dependent's health insurance plan under the 16 event of multiple insurers (New HOD Policy); and be it further 17 18 RESOLVED, That our AMA amend Policy H -190.969: \"Delay in Payments Due to Disputes in 19 Coordination of Benefits\" by addition to read as follows: 20 21 Delay in Payments Due to Disputes in Coordination of 22 Benefits, H -190.969 23 Our AMA: 24 (1) urges state and federal agencies to exercise their authority 25 over health plans to ensure that beneficiaries' claims are promptly 26 paid and that state and federal legislation that guarantees the 27 timely resolution of disputes in coordination of benefits between 28 health plans is actively enforced; 29 (2) includes the \"birthday rule\" as a last resort only after 30 parents/guardians have been allowed a choice of insurer and 31 have failed to choose, and the \"employer first rule\" in any and all 32 future AMA model legislation and model medical service 33 agreements that contain coordination of benefits information 34 and/or guidance on timely payment of health insurance claims; 35 (3) urges state medical associations to advocate for the inclusion 36 of the \"employer first rule\", and \"birthday rule\" as a last resort only 37 after parents/guardians have been allowed a choice of insurer and 38 have failed to choose, in state insurance statutes as mechanisms 39 for alleviating disputes in coordination of benefits; 40 (4) includes questions on payment timeliness in its Socioeconomic 41 Monitoring System survey to collect information on the extent of 42 the problem at the national level and to track the success of state 43 legislation on payment delays; 44 (5) continues to encourage state medical associations to utilize 45 the prompt payment provisions contained in the AMA Model 46 Managed Care Medical Services Agreement and in AMA model 47 state legislation; 48 (6) through its Advocacy Resource Center, continue to coordinate 49 and implement the timely payment campaign, including the 50 Resolution: 701 (A-23) Page 3 of 5 promotion of the payment delay survey instrument, to assess and 1 communicate the scope of payment delays as well as ensure 2 prompt payment of health insurance claims and interest accrual 3 on late payments by all health plans, including those regulated by 4 ERISA; and 5 (7) urges private sector health care accreditation organizations to 6 (a) develop and utilize standards that incorporate summary 7 statistics on claims processing performance, including claim 8 payment timeliness, and (b) require accredited health plans to 9 provide this information to patients, physicians, and other 10 purchasers of health care services.

Citation: Res. 610, I -08; Reaffirmed: CMS Rep. 01, A -18; Multiple Coverage in Voluntary Health Insurance H -185.999 (1) Over -insurance can arise when an individual is insured under two or more policies of health insurance. When the reimbursement from this multiple coverage exceeds the expenses against which the individual has insured himself, a profit may result. Over -insurance thus encourages wasteful use of the public's health care dollar. (2) A solution to this problem can be accomplished by the use of contract language and the application of coordination of benefits provisions which operate to enable persons covered under two or more group programs to be fully reimbursed for their expenses of insured services without receiving more in total benefits than the amount of such expenses. (3) Therefore, the AMA encourages the health insurance companies and prepayment plans to adopt policy provisions and mechanisms based upon the preceding principles which would control the adverse effects of over -insurance.

Our AMA supports the following principles to guide in the evaluation of the adequacy of health insurance coverage options: A. Any insurance pool or similar struc ture designed to enable access to age- appropriate health insurance coverage must include a wide variety of coverage options from which to choose. B. Existing federal guidelines regarding types of health insurance coverage (e.g., Title 26 of the US Tax Code and Federal Employees Health Benefits Program [FEHBP] regulations) should be used as a reference when considering if a given plan would provide meaningful coverage. C. Provisions must be made to assist individuals with low -incomes or unusually high medical costs in obtaining health insurance coverage and meeting cost -sharing obligations. D. Mechanisms must be in place to educate patients and assist them in making informed choices, including ensuring transparency among all health plans regarding covered ser vices, cost -sharing obligations, out -of-pocket limits and lifetime benefit caps, and excluded services. 2. Our AMA advocates that the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) program be used as the model for any essential health bene fits package for children. 3. Our AMA: (a) opposes the removal of categories from the essential health benefits (EHB) package and their associated protections against annual and lifetime limits, and out -of-pocket expenses; and (b) opposes waivers of EHB re quirements that lead to the elimination of EHB categories and their associated protections against annual and lifetime limits, and out -of-pocket expenses.

Citation: CMS Rep. 2, I -20; AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 702 (A-23) Introduced by: Medical Student Section Subject: Providing Reduced Parking for Patients Referred to: Reference Committee G Whereas, In the United States, an estimated four million individuals fail to receive annual 1 medical care due to transportation barriers1; and 2 3 Whereas, Many patients with common illnesses attend multiple outpatient appointments a 4 year, such as one study which showed 47% of patients with hypertension had four or more 5 visits in 20142; and 6 7 Whereas, Parking prices at some of the country's largest medical centers can be as high as 8 $20 to $43 per day3-4; and 9 10 Whereas, The public transportation system in the United States varies greatly within the 11 country in terms of usage, location, and infrastructure, with most of the public transport 12 concentrated in the Northeast5; and 13 14 Whereas, Approximately only a third of patients are within walking distance to their nearest 15 public transportation in certain metropolitan medical centers6; and 16 17 Whereas, Public transport is not readily available in all locations, such as rural areas where 18 the scarcity of local physicians can still require patients to drive to urban areas for care7; and 19 20 Whereas, Programs such as non -emergency patient/medical transportation (NEMT) are often 21 limited to approved patients within Medicaid and can have many disadvantages, including 22 restrictions on the type and number of rides, the necessity of a social worker to coordinate 23 transportation, having to schedule days in advance, and carpooling with other patients 24 leading to longer travel and wait times8; and 25 26 Whereas, The average cost of an NEMT in 2014 was $28, and this price rises in rural and 27 suburban areas that are farther from medical centers8,9; and 28 29 Whereas, When surveying older Americans, the group that utilizes the most inpatient and 30 outpatient healthcare, rideshare services were not seen as a practical option, with 74% of 31 patients reporting no knowledge of these services and only 1.7% making use of them10; and 32 33 Whereas, In a study of patients with heart disease, individuals reported the high cost of 34 parking at healthcare facilities as a financial barrier to attending multiple specialist 35 appointments11; and 36 37 Whereas, In a study of factors influencing family burden in pediatric hematology/oncology, 38 parking was cited as one of the most disproport ionately distressing factors12; and 39 Resolution: 702 (A-23) Page 2 of 4 Whereas, Nonmedical costs, such as transportation, meals, and child care, have been 1 reported to range from $50 to $165 a day, further contributing to a family's financial stress13; 2 and 3 4 Whereas, The lower the financial burden a patient has, the less likely they are to miss 5 appointments and adhere to treatment, preventing high cost emergent situations that would 6 lead to hospitals losing money on patients who cannot pay14; and 7 8 Whereas, Reduced parking fees have been cited as an incentive for patients to travel to 9 hospitals that can offer better treatment than local counterparts15; and 10 11 Whereas, A minority of hospitals rely on nonpatient care income to offset revenue losses, 12 such that providing parking vouchers would only represent a minor loss in revenue while 13 providing a major benefit to patients16; and 14 15 Whereas, Many hospitals have already implemented programs for patient parking such as 16 reduced monthly rates and free validated parking17-19; and 17 18 Whereas, Several associations of healthcare facilities focus on developing solutions for and 19 advocating improvements in social and economic aspects of healthcare, including the 20 American Hospital Association, the Federation of American Hospitals, and the Children's 21 Hospital Assoc iation20-27; and 22 23 Whereas, The American Hospital Association is a national organization of \"5,000 hospitals, 24 health care systems, networks, [and] other providers of care\" and publishes standards and 25 guidelines on various social and economic aspects of care20,21; and 26 27 Whereas, The Federation of American Hospitals is a national organization of over 1,000 28 hospitals that are not tax -exempt, including for -profit hospitals, and advocates their 29 priorities22-24; and 30 31 Whereas, The Children's Hospital Association is a national organization of over 220 pediatric 32 hospitals and develops and shares solutions with its members on various social and 33 economic aspects of care26,27; therefore be it 34 35 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association work with relevant stakeholders to 36 recognize parking fees as a barrier to patient care and encourage mechanisms for reducing 37 parking costs for patients and trainees.

(2) Physicians should be cost conscious and should exercise discretion, consistent with good medical care, in determining the medical necessity for hospitalization and the specific treatment, tests and ancillary medical services to be provided a patient. (3) Medical staffs, in cooperation with hospital administrators, should embark now upon a concerted effort to educate physicians, including house staff officers, on all aspects of hospital charges, including specific medical tests, proc edures, and all ancillary services. (4) Medical educators should be urged to include similar education for future physicians in the required medical school curriculum. (5) All physicians and medical staffs should join with hospital administrators and hospi tal governing boards nationwide in a conjoint and across -the-board effort to voluntarily contain and control the escalation of health care costs, individually and collectively, to the greatest extent possible consistent with good medical care. (6) All phys icians, practicing solo or in groups, independently or in professional association, should review their professional charges and operating overhead with the objective of providing quality medical care at optimum reasonable patient cost through appropriateness of fees and efficient office management, thus favorably moderating the rate of escalation of health care costs. (7) The AMA should widely publicize and disseminate information on activities of the AMA and state, county and national medical specialty societies which are designed to control or reduce the costs of health care.

(2) The federal government provide sufficient funds to support needed health services for American Indians. (3) State and local governments give special attention to the health and health- related needs of nonreservation American Indians in an effort to improve their quality of life. (4) American Indian religions and cultural beliefs be recognized and respected by those responsible for planning and providing services in Indian health programs. (5) Our AMA recognize the \"medicine man\" as an integral and culturally necessary individual in delivering health care to American Indians. (6) Strong emphasis be given to mental health programs for American Indians in an effort to reduce the high incidence of alcoholism, homicide, suicide, and accidents. (7) A team approach drawing from traditional health providers supplemented by psychiatric social workers, health aides, visiting nurses, and health educators be utilized in solving these problems. (8) Our AMA continue its liaison with the Indian Health Service and the National Indian Health Board and establish a liaison with the Association of American Indian Physicians. (9) State and county medical associations establish liaisons with intertribal health councils in those states where American Indians reside. (10) Our AMA supports and encourages further development and use of innovative delivery systems and staffing configurations to meet American Indian health needs but opposes overemphasis on research for the sake of research, particularly if needed federal funds are diverted from direct services for American Indians. (11) Our AMA strongly supports those bills before Congressional committees that aim to improve the health of and health- related services provided to American Indians and further recommends that members of appropriate AMA councils and committees provide testimony in favor of effective legislation and proposed regulations.

The AMA specifically recommends: (1) Indian Population: (a) In current education pr ograms, and in the expansion of educational activities suggested below, special consideration be given to involving the American Indian and Alaska native population in training for the various health professions, in the expectation that such professionals, if provided with adequate professional resources, facilities, and income, will be more likely to serve the tribal areas permanently; (b) Exploration with American Indian leaders of the possibility of increased numbers of nonfederal American Indian health centers, under tribal sponsorship, to expand the American Indian role in its own health care; (c) Increased involvement of private practitioners and facilities in American Indian care, through such mechanisms as agreements with tribal leaders or Indian Hea lth Service contracts, as well as normal private practice relationships; and (d) Improvement in transportation to make access to existing private care easier for the American Indian population. (2) Federal Facilities : Based on the distribution of the eligi ble population, transportation facilities and roads, and the availability of alternative nonfederal resources, the AMA recommends that those Indian Health Service facilities currently necessary for American Indian care be identified and that an immediate Resolution: 703 (A-23) Page 4 of 4 construction and modernization program be initiated to bring these facilities up to current standards of practice and accreditation. (3)Manpower : (a) Compensation for Indian Health Service physicians be increased to a level competitive with other Federal agencies and nongovernmental service; (b) Consideration should be given to increased compensation for service in remote areas; (c) In conjunction with improvement of Service facilities, efforts should be made to establish closer ties with teaching centers, thus increasing both the available manpower and the level of professional expertise available for consultation; (d) Allied health professional staffing of Service facilities should be maintained at a level appropriate to the special needs of the population served; (e) Continuing education opportunities should be provided for those health professionals serving these communities, and especially those in remote areas, and, increased peer contact, both to maintain the quality of care and to avert professional isolation; and (f) Consideration should be given to a federal statement of policy supporting continuation of the Public Health Service to reduce the great uncertainty now felt by many career officers of the corps. (4)Medical Societies : In those states where Indian Health Service facilities are located, and in counties containing or adjacent to Service facilities, that the appropriate medical societies should explore the possibility of increased formal liaison with local Indian Health Service physicians. Increased support from organized medicine for improvement of health care provided under their direction, including professional consultation and involvement in society activities should be pursued. (5) Our AMA also support the removal of any requirement for competitive bidding in the Indian Health Service that compromises proper care for the American Indian population.

Reduce cognitive workload; 6. Promote data liquidity; 7. Facilitate digital and mobile patient engagement; and 8. Expedite user input into product design and post -implementation feedback. Our AMA will AMA utilize HIT principles to: 1. Work with vendors to foster the development of usable EHRs; 2. Advocate to federal and state policymakers to develop effective HIT policy; 3. Collaborate with institutions and health care systems to develop effective institutional HIT policies; 4. Partner with researchers to advance our understanding of HIT usability; 5. Educate physicians about these priorities so they can lead in the development and use of future EHRs that can improve patient care; and 6. Promote the elimination of Information Blocking. Our AMA policy is that the cost of installing, maintaining, and upgrading information technology should be specifically acknowledged and addressed in reimbursement schedules.

Abstract presented at: Hospital Medicine 2019; March 24- 27, 2019; N Insufficient Sleep in Adolescents H -60.930 1. Our AMA identifies adolescent insufficient sleep and sleepiness as a public health issue and supports education about sleep health as a standard component of care for adolescent patients. 2. Our AMA: (a) encourages school districts to aim for the start of middle schools and high schools to be no earlier than 8:30 a.m., in order to allow adolescents time for adequate sleep; (b) encourages physicians, especially those who work closely with school districts, to become actively involved in the education of parents, school administrators, teachers, and other members of the community to stress the importance of sleep and consequences of sleep deprivation among adolescents, and to encourage school districts to structure school start times to accommodate the biologic sleep needs of adolescents; and (c) encourages continued research on the impact of sleep on adolescent health and academic performance.

Supports the need for developing and implementing technol ogies to reduce glare from vehicle headlamps and roadway lighting schemes, and developing lighting technologies at home and at work that minimize circadian disruption, while maintaining visual efficiency. 2. Recognizes that exposure to excessive light at n ight, including extended use of various electronic media, can disrupt sleep or exacerbate sleep disorders, especially in children and adolescents. This effect can be minimized by using dim red lighting in the nighttime bedroom environment. 3. Supports the need for further multidisciplinary research on the risks and benefits of occupational and environmental exposure to light -at-night. 4. That work environments operating in a 24/7 hour fashion have an employee fatigue risk management plan in place. Citation: CSAPH Rep. 4, A -12; Rep. 1, A -22; Resident/Fellow Clinical and Educational Work Hours H -310.907 Our AMA adopts the following Principles of Resident/Fellow Clinical and Educational Work Hours, Patient Safety, and Qua lity of Physician Training: 1. Our AMA supports the 2017 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) standards for clinical and educational work hours (previously referred to as \"duty hours\"). 2. Our AMA will continue to monitor the enforc ement and impact of clinical and educational work hour standards, in the context of the larger issues of patient safety and the optimal learning environment for residents. 3. Our AMA encourages publication and supports dissemination of studies in peer -reviewed publications and educational sessions about all aspects of clinical and educational work hours, to include such topics as extended work shifts, handoffs, in- house call and at -home call, level of supervision by attending physicians, workload and growin g service demands, moonlighting, protected sleep periods, sleep deprivation and fatigue, patient safety, medical error, continuity of care, resident well -being and burnout, development of professionalism, resident learning outcomes, and preparation for ind ependent practice. 4. Our AMA endorses the study of innovative models of clinical and educational work hour requirements and, pending the outcomes of ongoing and future research, should consider the evolution of specialty - and rotation- specific requirement s that are evidence- based and will optimize patient safety and competency -based learning opportunities. 5. Our AMA encourages the ACGME to: a) Decrease the barriers to reporting of both clinical and educational work hour violations and resident intimidatio n. b) Ensure that readily accessible, timely and accurate information about clinical and educational work hours is not constrained by the cycle of ACGME survey visits. c) Use, where possible, recommendations from respective specialty societies and evidence- based approaches to any future revision or introduction of clinical and educational work hour rules. d) Broadly disseminate aggregate data from the annual ACGME survey on the educational environment of resident physicians, encompassing all aspects of clinical and educational work hours. 6. Our AMA recognizes the ACGME for its work in ensuring an appropriate balance between resident education and patient safety, and encourages the ACGME to continue to: a) Offer incentives to programs/institutions to ensure compliance with clinical and educational work hour standards. b) Ensure that site visits include meetings with peer -selected or randomly selected residents and that residents who are not interviewed during site visits have the opportunity to provide information directly to the site visitor. c) Collect data on at -home call from both program directors and resident/fellow physicians; release these aggregate data annually; and develop standards to ensure that appropriate education and supervision are maintained, whether the setting is in- house or at -home. d) Ensure that resident/fellow physicians receive education on sleep deprivation and fatigue. Resolution: 704 (A-23) Page 5 of 5 7. Our AMA supports the following statements related to clinical and educational work hours: a) Total clinical and e ducational work hours must not exceed 80 hours per week, averaged over a four - week period (Note: \"Total clinical and educational work hours\" includes providing direct patient care or supervised patient care that contributes to meeting educational goals; participating in formal educational activities; providing administrative and patient care services of limited or no educational value; and time needed to transfer the care of patients). b) Scheduled on- call assignments should not exceed 24 hours. Residents may remain on- duty for an additional 4 hours to complete the transfer of care, patient follow -up, and education; however, residents may not be assigned new patients, cross -coverage of other providers' patients, or continuity clinic during that time. c) Time spent in the hospital by residents on at -home call must count towards the 80- hour maximum weekly hour limit, and on- call frequency must not exceed every third night averaged over four weeks. The frequency of at -home call is not subject to the every -third-night limitation, but must satisfy the requirement for one- day-in-seven free of duty, when averaged over four weeks. d) At -home call must not be so frequent or taxing as to preclude rest or reasonable personal time for each resident. e) Residents are permi tted to return to the hospital while on at -home call to care for new or established patients. Each episode of this type of care, while it must be included in the 80- hour weekly maximum, will not initiate a new \"off -duty period.\" f) Given the different educ ation and patient care needs of the various specialties and changes in resident responsibility as training progresses, clinical and educational work hour requirements should allow for flexibility for different disciplines and different training levels to ensure appropriate resident education and patient safety; for example, allowing exceptions for certain disciplines, as appropriate, or allowing a limited increase to the total number of clinical and educational work hours when need is demonstrated. g) Resid ent physicians should be ensured a sufficient duty -free interval prior to returning to duty. h) Clinical and educational work hour limits must not adversely impact resident physician participation in organized educational activities. Formal educational act ivities must be scheduled and available within total clinical and educational work hour limits for all resident physicians. i) Scheduled time providing patient care services of limited or no educational value should be minimized. j) Accurate, honest, and c omplete reporting of clinical and educational work hours is an essential element of medical professionalism and ethics. k) The medical profession maintains the right and responsibility for self -regulation (one of the key tenets of professionalism) through the ACGME and its purview over graduate medical education, and categorically rejects involvement by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, The Joint Commission, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and any other federal or state government bodies in the monitoring and enforcement of clinical and educational work hour regulations, and opposes any regulatory or legislative proposals to limit the work hours of practicing physicians. l) Increased financial assistance for residents/fellows, such as subsidized child care, loan deferment, debt forgiveness, and tax credits, may help mitigate the need for moonlighting. At the same time, resident/fellow physicians in good standing with their programs should be afforded the opportunity for internal and external moonlighting that complies with ACGME policy. m) Program directors should establish guidelines for scheduled work outside of the residency program, such as moonlighting, and must approve and monitor that work such that it does not interfere with the ability of the resident to achieve the goals and objectives of the educational program. n) The costs of clinical and educational work hour limits should be borne by all health care payers. Individual resident compensation and benefits must not be compr omised or decreased as a result of changes in the graduate medical education system. o) The general public should be made aware of the many contributions of resident/fellow physicians to high-quality patient care and the importance of trainees' realizing t heir limits (under proper supervision) so that they will be able to competently and independently practice under real -world medical situations. 8. Our AMA is in full support of the collaborative partnership between allopathic and osteopathic professional and accrediting bodies in developing a unified system of residency/fellowship accreditation for all residents and fellows, with the overall goal of ensuring patient safety. 9. Our AMA will actively participate in ongoing efforts to monitor the impact of cli nical and educational work hour limitations to ensure that patient safety and physician well -being are not jeopardized by excessive demands on post -residency physicians, including program directors and attending physicians.

and 3 4 Whereas, Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) is currently the most widely available and 5 commonly used state- funded form of autism therapy in Canada and the United States2,3; and 6 7 Whereas, Autism treatment represents a fragmented industry that consists of a mixture of for- 8 profit and nonprofit organizations, with the top nine for -profit chains estimated to have a 9 combined revenue of $547 million and a market value close to $2 billion with future growth 10 expected4; and 11 12 Whereas, An ABA software company reports over 3 billion in claims processed annually for 13 about 1,300 practices highlighting the prevalence of ABA use as an intervention for 14 individuals with autism5; and 15 16 Whereas, Autism Speaks lists 3,194 centers across the United States who offer ABA therapy 17 as of 20226; and 18 19 Whereas, ABA was conceived in 1961 by Dr. Ole Ivar Lovaas to condition neurotypical 20 behaviors in children he viewed as \"incomplete humans\"7-10; and 21 22 Whereas, Desired behavior is often defined by the adult or behaviorist without input or 23 requirement of consent from the child and may include non- harmful stimming or coping 24 behaviors2,3,8,11,12; and 25 26 Whereas, ABA uses behavior modification techniques to eliminate behaviors deemed 27 undesirable2,8,11 -14; and 28 29 Whereas, ABA practices are historically based in abuse such as holding autistic children's 30 communication hostage through the use of their devices as leverage, and denying basic 31 rights such as food and toileting privileges2,3,8,11,14 -18; and 32 33 Whereas, Modern ABA still abides by the founding principle of making a child appear 34 \"normal\" or \"indistinguishable from one's peers\", which serves to separate the humanity of 35 the individual with autism from desired behaviors2,8,15; and 36 37 Whereas, A 2018 study found that Adults with autism who have received ABA are more 38 prone to suicide19; and 39 Resolution: 706 (A-23) Page 2 of 4 Whereas, ABA has been repeatedly linked to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), with 1 46% of 460 ABA participants meeting the diagnostic threshold for PTSD in an online 2 survey20; and 3 4 Whereas, Adults with autism have been continuously outspoken about the trauma incurred 5 by ABA practices experienced in their childhood2,14,16- 18; and 6 7 Whereas, A 2012 literature review found the evidence base for services for adults with an 8 ASD to be underdeveloped21; and 9 10 Whereas, A 2018 Cochrane review recommend further research after reporting very weak 11 evidence in support of ABA22; and 12 13 Whereas, A 2022 informal online community survey found that 71 % of adults with autism 14 responded \"disagree\" or \"strongly disagree\" to the statement \"Generally speaking, I support 15 ABA therapy for autistic children\"23; and 16 17 Whereas, A 2020 Department of Defense report demonstrated a lack of correlation between 18 improvement in symptoms and hours of direct ABA services, found that the improvements 19 recorded were due to reasons other than ABA services, and ABA services did not meet the 20 TRICARE hierarchy of evidence standard for medical and proven care24; and 21 22 Whereas, A 2021 study on conflicts of interest (COIs) in autism early intervention research 23 found COIs to be prevalent and under -reported , with 70% of studies containing a conflict of 24 interest and less than 6% declaring them as such25; and 25 26 Whereas, Current research supports alternatives to ABA such as the Developmental, 27 Individual Differences, and Relationship- based (DIRTM) program, the PLAY Project, 28 individualized Early Social Interaction (ESI) and, Social Communication, Emotional 29 Regulation, and Transactional Support (SCERTSTM)24,26- 29; and 30 31 Whereas, Current AMA policy supports the use of ABA through its advocation of coverage of 32 ABA and the evidence- based treatment for autism and fails to recognize its harms or 33 controversial nature within the community at large; therefore be it 34 35 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association support research towards the 36 evaluation and the development of interventions and programs for autistic individuals (New 37 HOD Policy) ;

AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HOUSE OF DELEGATES Resolution: 708 (A-23) Introduced by: American College of Gastroenterology Association American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Subject: Comprehensive Prior Authorization for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Procedures Referred to: Reference Committee G Whereas, As of June 1, 2023, UnitedHealthcare (UHC) requires prior authorization for all 1 diagnostic and surveillance colonoscopies, esophagogastroduodenoscopies (EGDs), and 2 capsule endoscopies; and 3 4 Whereas, This policy is contradictory to UHC's announced plans to eliminate 20% of its current 5 prior authorizations starting the summer of 2023 and introduce a \"Gold Card\" program in 2024; 6 and 7 8 Whereas, The American Medical Association 2021 Prior Authorization Physician Survey 9 revealed that 1; 10 93% of physicians report care delays as a result of your authorization. 11 82% of physicians report prior authorization can lead to treatment abandonment. 12 34% of physicians reported prior authorization has led to a serious adverse event. 13 51% of physicians report prior authorization has interfered with a patient's ability to 14 perform their job responsibilities; and 15 16 Whereas, The AMA 2021 Prior Authorization Physician Survey also reveals that physicians 17 complete an average of 45 prior authorizations a week1; and 18 19 Whereas, The AMA's current position is that prior authorization, if used at all, must be used 20 judiciously, efficiently, and in a manner that prevents cost- shifting onto patients, physicians and 21 other providers2 and discourages volume reduction solutions such as the elimination of prior 22 authorization requirements for regularly approved care, gold- carding programs, and other 23 exemption programs3; and 24 25 Whereas, The Office of Inspector General (OIG) review of Medicare Advantage Organizations 26 (MAOs) appealed preauthorization and payment denials, MAOs overturned 75 percent of their 27 own denials. The OIG also found that beneficiaries and providers appealed only 1 percent of 28 denials to the first level of appeal6; and 29 30 Whereas, A 2022 American College of Gastroenterology survey found that more than 50% of 31 members surveyed reported that prior authorization led to a serious adverse event in patients4 32 and a 2022 American Gastroenterological Association survey found that 56% of members 33 reported that prior authorization restrictions have \"significantly\" impacted patient access to 34 clinically appropriate treatments and patient clinical outcomes18; and 35 Resolution: 708 (A-23) Page 2 of 7 Whereas , It also revealed that the alternative treatments were less effec tive, more costly to 1 patients, less tolerable and/or supported by a lower level of clinical evidence4; and 2 3 Whereas, 2022 AMA data reveal 46% of respondents reported that prior authorization policies 4 led to urgent or emergency care for patients and 86% reported prior authorization led to higher 5 utilization of healthcare resources5; and 6 7 Whereas, All of the procedures flagged for prior authorization by UHC have robust multi -society 8 clinical guidelines and quality indicators that can be used with a directed utilization review 9 policy7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15; and 10 11 Whereas, This UHC policy is a blanket obstruction to the practice of diagnostic and therapeutic 12 endoscopy rather than a directed utilization review of suspected outliers. AMA Prior 13 Authorization and U tilization Principle #19 states \"Health plans should restrict utilization 14 management programs to \"outlier\" providers whose prescribing or ordering patterns differ 15 significantly from their peers after adjusting for patient mix and other relevant factors\" 16; and 16 17 Whereas, The AMA, AHA, AHIP, BCBS, MGMA and the APhA have agreed to a Consensus 18 Statement on Improving the Prior Authorization Process including an agreement to \"Encourage 19 the use of programs that selectively implement prior authorization requirements based on 20 stratification of health care providers' performance and adherence to evidence- based 21 medicine\" 7; and 22 23 Whereas, UHC has failed to provide, and denied access to, any documentation showing recent 24 evidence of overutilization or to identify speci fic CPT procedure codes of concern in spite of 25 multiple requests; and 26 27 Whereas, A coalition of over 90 patient advocacy groups, national and state medical 28 associations urged UHC not to move forward with these prior authorization rules, due to the 29 significa nt impact on access to care and to the patient -physician relationship; therefore be it 30 31 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association strongly advocate with all state and federal 32 agencies for the cancellation of UHC's 2023 blanket prior authorization pol icy directed at 33 endoscopic procedures in favor of a directed utilization review of presumed outliers (Directive to 34 Take Action) ; and be it further 35 36 RESOLVED, That our AMA redouble its efforts to promote state laws such as the AMA's 37 example \"Ensuring Transparency in Prior Authorization Act\" (Directive to Take Action) ; and be it 38 further 39 40 RESOLVED, That our AMA communicate with the various state insurance commissioners 41 concerning UHC's prior authorization policy change, which has the potential to adversely aff ect 42 access, quality, and equity of G.I. patient care.

The American Journal of 115(3):p 8/fulltext RELEVANT AMA POLICY Approaches to Increase Payer Accountability H -320.968 Our AMA supports the development of legislative initiatives to assure that payers provide their insureds with information enabling them to make informed decisions about choice of plan, and to assure that payers take responsibility when patients are harmed due to the administrative requirements of the plan. Such initiatives should provide for disclosure requirements, the conduct of review, and payer account ability. (1) Disclosure Requirements. Our AMA supports the development of model draft state and federal legislation to require disclosure in a clear and concise standard format by health benefit plans to prospective enrollees of information on (a) coverage provisions, benefits, and exclusions; (b) prior authorization or other review requirements, including claims review, which may affect the provision or coverage of services; (c) plan financial arrangements or contractual provisions that would limit the services offered, restrict referral or treatment options, or negatively affect the physician's fiduciary responsibility to his or her patient; (d) medical expense ratios; and (e) cost of health insurance policy premiums. (Ref. Cmt. G, Rec. 2, A- 96; Reaffirmation A -97) (2) Conduct of Review. Our AMA supports the development of additional draft state and federal legislation to: (a) require private review entities and payers to disclose to physicians on request the screening criteria, weighting elements and computer algorithms utilized in the review process, and how they were developed; (b) require that any physician who recommends a denial as to the medical necessity of services on behalf of a review entity be of the same specialty as the practitioner who provided the services under review; (c) Require every organization that reviews or contracts for review of the medical Resolution: 708 (A-23) Page 4 of 7 necessity of services to establish a procedure whereby a physician claimant has an opportunity to appeal a claim denied for lack of medical necessity to a medical consultant or peer review group which is independent of the organization conducting or contracting for the initial review; (d) require that any physician who makes judgments or recommendations regarding the necessity or appropriateness of services or site of service be licensed to practice medicine in the same jurisdiction as the practitioner who is proposing the service or whose services are being reviewed; (e) require that review entities respond within 48 hours to patient or physician requests for prior authorization, and that they have personnel available by telephone the same business day who are qualified to respond to other concerns or questions regarding medical necessity of services, including determinations about the certificatio n of continued length of stay; (f) require that any payer instituting prior authorization requirements as a condition for plan coverage provide enrollees subject to such requirements with consent forms for release of medical information for utilization rev iew purposes, to be executed by the enrollee at the time services requiring such prior authorization are recommended or proposed by the physician; and (g) require that payers compensate physicians for those efforts involved in complying with utilization review requirements that are more costly, complex and time consuming than the completion of standard health insurance claim forms. Compensation should be provided in situations such as obtaining preadmission certification, second opinions on elective surgery , and certification for extended length of stay. (3) Accountability. Our AMA believes that draft federal and state legislation should also be developed to impose similar liability on health benefit plans for any harm to enrollees resulting from failure to disclose prior to enrollment the information on plan provisions and operation specified under Section 1 (a) -(d) above.

(2) Reaffirms the following principles for evaluation of preadmission review programs, as adopted by the House of Delegates at the 1986 Annual Meeting: (a) Blanket preadmission review of all or the majority of hospital admissions does not improve the quality of care and should not be mandated by government, other payers, or hospitals. (b) Policies for review should be established by state or local physician review committees, and the actual review should be performed by physicians or under the close supervision of physicians. (c) Adverse decisions concerning hospital admissions should be finalized only by physician reviewers and only after the reviewing physician has discussed the case with the attending physician. (d) All preadmission review programs should provide for immediate hospitalization, without prior authorization, of any patient whose treating physician determines the admission to be of an emergency nature. (e) No preadmission review program should make a payment denial based solely on the failure to obtain preadmission review or solely on the fact that hospitalization occurred in the face of a denial for such admission. (3) Affirms as policy and advocates to all public and private payers the right of claimants to review by a physician of the same general specialty as the attending physician of any clai m or request for prior authorization denied on the basis of medical necessity.

Citation: Res. 701, A -22; Promoting Accountability in Prior Authorization D -285.960 Our AMA will: (1) advocate that peer -to-peer (P2P) prior authorization (PA) determinations must be made and actionable at the end of the P2P discussion notwithstanding mitigating circumstances, which would allow for a determination within 24 hours of the P2P discussion; (2) advocate th at the reviewing P2P physician must have the clinical expertise to treat the medical condition or disease under review and have knowledge of the current, evidence- based clinical guidelines and novel treatments; (3) advocate that P2P PA reviewers follow evi dence -based guidelines consistent with national medical specialty society guidelines where available and applicable; (4) continue to advocate for a reduction in the overall volume of health plans' PA requirements and urge temporary suspension of all PA requirements and the extension of existing approvals during a declared public health emergency; (5) advocate that health plans must undertake every effort to accommodate the physician's schedule when requiring peer -to-peer prior authorization conversations; and (6) advocate that health plans must not require prior authorization on any medically necessary surgical or other invasive procedure related or incidental to the original procedure if it is furnished during the course of an operation or procedure that wa s already approved or did not require prior authorization. Citation: CMS Rep. 4, A -21; Managed Care H -285.998 (1) Introduction The needs of patients are best served by free market competition and free choice by physicians and patients between alternative delivery and financing systems, with the growth of each system determined not by preferential regulation and subsidy, but by the number of persons who prefer that mode of delivery or financing. (2) Definition \"Managed care\" is defined as those processes or techniques used by any entity that delivers, administers, and/or assumes risk for health care services in order to control or influence the quality, accessibility, utilization, or costs and prices or outcomes of such services provided to a defined enrolle e population. (3) Techniques Managed care techniques currently employed include any or all of the following: (a) prior, concurrent, or retrospective review of the quality, medical necessity, and/or appropriateness of services or the site of services; (b) c ontrolled access to and/or coordination of services by a case manager; (c) efforts to identify treatment alternatives and to modify benefits for patients with high cost conditions; (d) provision of services through a network of contracting providers, selec ted and deselected on the basis of standards related to cost -effectiveness, quality, geographic location, specialty, and/or other criteria; (e) enrollee Resolution: 708 (A-23) Page 6 of 7 financial incentives and disincentives to use such providers, or specific service sites; and (f) accept ance by participating providers of financial risk for some or all of the contractually obligated services, or of discounted fees. (4) Case Management Health plans using the preferred provider concept should not use coverage arrangements which impair the co ntinuity of a patient's care across different treatment settings. With the increased specialization of modern health care, it is advantageous to have one individual with overall responsibility for coordinating the medical care of the patient. The physician is best suited by professional preparation to assume this leadership role. The primary goal of high- cost case management or benefits management programs should be to help to arrange for the services most appropriate to the patient's needs; cost containment is a legitimate but secondary objective. In developing an alternative treatment plan, the benefits manager should work closely with the patient, attending physician, and other relevant health professionals involved in the patient's care. Any health plan which makes available a benefits management program for individual patients should not make payment for services contingent upon a patient's participation in the program or upon adherence to treatment recommendations. (5) Utilization Review The medical protocols and review criteria used in any utilization review or utilization management program must be developed by physicians. Public and private payers should be required to disclose to physicians on request the screening and review criteria, weighting elements, and computer algorithms utilized in the review process, and how they were developed. A physician of the same specialty must be involved in any decision by a utilization management program to deny or reduce coverage for services based on questions of medical necessity. All health plans conducting utilization management or utilization review should establish an appeals process whereby physicians, other health care providers, and patients may challenge policies restricting access to specific services and decisions to deny coverage for services, and have the right to review of any coverage denial based on medical necessity by a physician independent of the health plan who is of the same specialty and has appropriate expertise and experience in the field. A physician whose services are being reviewed for medical necessity should be provided the identity of the reviewing physician on request. Any physician who makes judgments or recommendations regarding the necessity or appropriateness of services or site of services should be licensed to practice medicine and actively practicing in the same jurisdiction as the practitioner who is proposing or providing the reviewed service and should be professionally and individually accountable for his or her decisions. All health benefit plans should be required to clearly and understandably communicate to enrollees and prospective enrollees in a standard disclosure format those services which they will and will not cover and the extent of coverage for the former. The information disclosed should include the proportion of plan income devoted to utilization management, marketing, and other administrative costs, and the existence of any review requirements, financial arrangements or other restrictions that may limit services, referral or treatment options, or negatively affect the physician's fiduciary responsibility to his or her patients. It is the responsibility of the patient and his or her health benefits plan to inform the treating physician of any coverage restrictions imposed by the plan. All health plans utilizing managed care techniques should be subject to legal action for any harm incurred by the patient resulting from application of such techniques. Such plans should also be subject to legal action for any harm to enrollees resulting from failure to disclose prior to enrollment any coverage provisions; review requirements; financial arrangements; or other restrictions that may limit services, referral, or treatment options, or negatively affect the physician's fiduc iary responsibility to his or her patient. When inordinate amounts of time or effort are involved in providing case management services required by a third party payer which entail coordinating access to other health care services needed by the patient, or in complying with utilization review requirements, the physician may charge the payer or the patient for the reasonable cost incurred. \"Inordinate\" efforts are defined as those \"more costly, complex and time- consuming than the completion of standard healt h insurance claim forms, such as obtaining preadmission certification, second opinions on elective surgery, certification for extended length of stay, and other authorizations as a condition of payer coverage.\" Any health plan or utilization management fir m conducting a prior authorization program should act within two business days on any patient or physician request for prior authorization and respond within one business day to other questions regarding medical necessity of services. Any health plan requi ring prior authorization for covered services should provide enrollees subject to such requirements with consent forms for release of medical information for utilization review purposes, to be executed by the enrollee at Resolution: 708 (A-23) Page 7 of 7 the time services requiring prior a uthorization are recommended by the physicians. In the absence of consistent and scientifically established evidence that preadmission review is cost - saving or beneficial to patients, the AMA strongly opposes the use of this process.

Our AMA actively supports payment to physicians by contractors and third party payers for physician time and efforts in providing case management and supervisory services, including but not limited to coordination of care and office staff time spent to comply with third party payer protocols. 2. It is AMA policy that insurers pay physicians fair compensation for work associated with prior authorizations, including pre- certifications and prior notifications, that reflects the actual time expended by physicians to comply with insurer requirem ents and that compensates physicians fully for the legal risks inherent in such work. 3. Our AMA urges insurers to adhere to the AMA's Health Insurer Code of Conduct Principles including specifically that requirements imposed on physicians to obtain prior authorizations, including pre-certifications and prior notifications, must be minimized and streamlined and health insurers must maintain sufficient staff to respond promptly.

Our AMA strongly enc ourages vendors to increase the functionality of their practice management systems to allow physicians to send and receive electronic standard transactions directly to payers and completely automate their claims management revenue cycle and will continue t o strongly encourage payers and their vendors to work with the AMA and the Federation to streamline the prior authorization process. 2. Our AMA will continue its strong leadership role in automating, standardizing and simplifying all administrative actions required for transactions between payers and providers. 3. Our AMA will continue its strong leadership role in automating, standardizing, and simplifying the claims revenue cycle for physicians in all specialties and modes of practice with all their tradi ng partners, including, but not limited to, public and private payers, vendors, and clearinghouses. 4. Our AMA will prioritize efforts to automate, standardize and simplify the process for physicians to estimate patient and payer financial responsibility b efore the service is provided, and determine patient and payer financial responsibility at the point of care, especially for patients in high- deductible health plans. 5. Our AMA will continue to use its strong leadership role to support state and specialty society initiatives to simplify administrative functions. 6. Our AMA will continue its efforts to ensure that physicians are aware of the value of automating their claims cycle.

Resolution: 709 (A-23) Page 3 of 4 RELEVANT AMA POLICY E-1.1.1 Patient -Physician Relationships The practice of medicine, and its embodiment in the clinical encounter between a patient and a physician, is fundamentally a moral activity that arises from the imperative to care for patients and to alleviate suffering. The relationship between a patient and a physician is based on trust, which gives rise to physicians' ethical responsibility to place patients' welfare above the physician's own self -interest or obligations to others, to use sound medical judgment on patients' behalf, and to advocate for their patients' we lfare. A patient -physician relationship exists when a physician serves a patient's medical needs. Generally, the relationship is entered into by mutual consent between physician and patient (or surrogate). However, in certain circumstances a limited patient -physician relationship may be created without the patient's (or surrogate's) explicit agreement. Such circumstances include: (a) When a physician provides emergency care or provides care at the request of the patient's treating physician. In these circumstances, the patient's (or surrogate's) agreement to the relationship is implicit. (b) When a physician provides medically appropriate care for a prisoner under court order, in keeping with ethics guidance on court -initiated treatment. (c) When a physician examines a patient in the context of an independent medical examination, in keeping with ethics guidance. In such situations, a limited patient -physician relationship exists. Issued: 2016 E-1.1.3 Patient Rights The health and well -being of patients depends on a collaborative effort between patient and physician in a mutually respectful alliance. Patients contribute to this alliance when they fulfill responsibilities they have, to seek care and to be candid with their physicians, for example. Physicians can best contribute to a mutually respectful alliance with patients by serving as their patients' advocates and by respecting patients' rights. These include the right: (a) To courtesy, respect, dignity, and timely, responsive attention to his or her needs. (b) To receive information from their physicians and to have opportunity to discuss the benefits, risks, and costs of appropriate treatment alternatives, including the risks, benefits and costs of forgoing treatment. Patients should be able to expect that their physicians will provide guidance about what they consider the optimal course of action for the patient based on the physician's objective professional judgment. (c) To ask questions about their health status or recommended treatment when they do not fully understand what has been described and to have their questions answered. (d) To make decisions about the care the physician recommends and to have those decisions respected. A patient who has decision- making capacity may accept or refuse any r ecommended medical intervention. (e) To have the physician and other staff respect the patient's privacy and confidentiality. (f) To obtain copies or summaries of their medical records. (g) To obtain a second opinion. (h) To be advised of any conflicts of interest their physician may have in respect to their care. (i) To continuity of care. Patients should be able to expect that their physician will cooperate in coordinating medically indicated care with other health care professionals, and that the physici an will not discontinue treating them when further treatment is medically indicated without giving them sufficient notice and reasonable assistance in making alternative arrangements for care. Issued: 2016 Obstetrical Delivery in the Home or Outpatient Facility H -420.998 Our AMA (1) believes that obstetrical deliveries should be performed in properly licensed, accredited, equipped and staffed obstetrical units; (2) believes that obstetrical care should be provided by qualified and licensed personnel who function in an environment conducive to peer review; (3) believes that obstetrical facilities and their staff should recognize the wishes of women and their families within the bounds of sound obstetrical practice; and (4) encourages public education concerning the risks and benefits of various birth alternatives. Citation: Res. 23, A -78; Reaffirmed: CLRPD Rep. Reaffirmed: CSAPH -20; Resolution: 709 of 4 Shared Decision -Making H -373.997 Our AMA: 1. recognizes the formal shared decision- making process as having three core elements to help patients become active partners in their health care: (a) clinical information about health conditions, treatment options, and potential outcomes; (b) tools to help patients identify and articulate their values and priorities when choosing medical treatment options; and (c) structured guidance to help patients integrate clinical and values information to make an informed treatment choice; 2. supports the concept of voluntary use of shared decision- making processes and patient decision aids as a way to strengthen the patient -physician relationship and facilitate informed patient engagement in health care decisions; 3. opposes any ef forts to require the use of patient decision aids or shared decision- making processes as a condition of health insurance coverage or provider participation; 4. supports the development of demonstration and pilot projects to help increase knowledge about integrating shared decision -making tools and processes into clinical practice; 5. supports efforts to establish and promote quality standards for the development and use of patient decision aids, including standards for physician involvement in development and evaluation processes, clinical accuracy, and conflict of interest disclosures; and 6. will continue to study the concept of shared decision -making and report back to the House of Delegates regarding developments in this area.

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES B of T Report 05 -A-23 Subject: Update on Corporate Relationships Presented by: Sandra Adamson Fryhofer, MD PURPOSE 1 2 The purpose of this informational report is to update the House of Delegates (HOD) on the results 3 of the Corporate Review process from January 1 through December 31, 2022. Corporate activities 4 that associate the American Medical Association (AMA) name or logo with a company, non - 5 Federation association or foundation, or include commercial support, currently undergo review and 6 recommendations by the Corporate Review Team (CRT) (Appendix A). 7 8 BACKGROUND 9 10 At the 2002 Annual Meeting, the HOD approved revised principles to govern the American 11 Medical Association's (AMA) corporate relationships, HOD Policy G -630.040 \"Principles on 12 Corporate Relationships.\" These guidelines for American Medical Association corporate 13 relationships were incorporated into the corporate review process, are reviewed regularly, and were 14 reaffirme d at the 2012 and 2022 Annual Meeting. AMA managers are responsible for reviewing 15 AMA projects to ensure they fit within these guidelines. 16 17 YEAR 2022 RESULTS 18 19 In 2022, 92 activities were considered and approved through the Corporate Review process. Of the 20 92 projects recommended for approval, 48 were conferences or events, 1 1 were educational content 21 or grants, 27 were collaborations or affiliations, f ive were member programs, and one was an 22 American Medical Association Foundation (AMAF) program. See Appendix B for details. 23 24 CONCLUSION 25 26 The Board of Trustees (BOT) continues to evaluate the CRT review process to balance risk 27 assessment with the need for external collaborations that advance the AMA's strategic focus. 28 B of T Rep. 05 -A-23 -- page 2 of 25 Appendix A CORPORATE REVIEW PROCESS OVERVIEW The Corporate Review Team (CRT) includes senior managers from the following areas: Strategy, Finance, Health Solutions (HS), Advocacy, Office of the General Counsel, Medical Education, Publishing, Enterprise Communications (EC), Marketing and Member Experience (MMX), Center for Health Equity (CHE) , and Health, Science and Ethics . The CRT evaluates each project submitted to determine fit or conflict with AMA Corporate Guidelines, covering: Type, purpose, and duration of the activity; Audience; Company, association, foundation, or academic institution invol ved (due diligence reviewed); Source of external funding; Use of the AMA logo; Editorial control/copyright; Exclusive or non- exclusive nature of the arrangement; Status of single and multiple supporters; and Risk assessment for AMA. The CRT reviews and makes recommendations regarding the following types of activities that utilize AMA name and logo: Industry- supported web, print, or conference projects directed to physicians or patients that do not adhere to Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME) Standards and Essentials. AMA sponsorship of external events. Independent and company- sponsored foundation supported projects. AMA licensing and publishing programs. (These corporate arrangements involve licensing AMA products or information to corporate or non- profit entities in exchange for a royalty and involve the use of AMA's name, logo, and trademarks. This does not include database or Current Procedural Terminology (CPT \u00ae) licensing.) Member programs such as new affinity or insurance programs and member benefits. Third -party relationships such as joint ventures, business partnerships, or co- branding programs directed to members. Non-profit association collaborations outside the Federation. The CRT reviews all non- profit association projects (Federation or non- Federation) that involve corporate sponsorship. Collaboration with academic institutions in cases where there is corporate sponsorship. For the above specified activities, if the CRT recommends approval, the project pr oceeds. B of T Rep. 05 -A-23 -- page 3 of 25 In addition to CRT review, the Executive Committee of the Board must review and approve CRT recommendations for the following AMA activities: Any activity directed to the public with external funding. Single -sponsor activities that do not meet ACCME Standards and Essentials. Activities involving risk of substantial financial penalties for cancellation. Upon request of a dissenting member of the CRT. Any other activity upon request of the CRT. All Corporate Review recommendations are summarized annually for information to the Board of Trustees (BOT). The BOT informs the HOD of all corporate arrangements at the Annual Meeting.

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES B of T Report 06-A-23 Subject: Redefining AMA's Position on ACA and Healthcare Reform Presented by: Sandra Adamson Fryhofer , MD, Chair At the 2013 Annual Meeting of the House of Delegates (HOD), the HOD adopted Policy 1 D-165.938, \"Redefining AMA's Position on ACA and Healthcare Reform,\" which calls on our 2 American Medical Association (AMA) to \"develop a policy statement clearly outlining this 3 organization's policies\" on several specific issues related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) as well 4 as repealing the SGR and the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB). The adopted policy 5 also calls for our AMA to report back at each meeting of the HOD. Board of T rustees Report 6 6-I-13, \"Redefining AMA's Position on ACA and Healthcare Reform,\" accomplished the original 7 intent of the policy . This report serves as an update on the issues and related developments 8 occurring since the most recent meeting of the HOD. 9 10 IMPROVING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT 11 12 Our AMA continues to engage policymakers and advocate for meaningful, affordable health care 13 for all Americans to improve the health of our nation . Our AMA remains committed to the goal of 14 universal coverage, which includes protecting coverage for the 20 million Americans who acquired 15 it through the ACA. Our AMA has been working to fix the current system by advanc ing solutions 16 that make coverage more affordable and expanding the system's reach to Americans who fall 17 within its gaps . Our AMA also remains committed to improving health care access so that patients 18 receive timely, high- quality care, preventive services, medications, and other necessary treatments . 19 20 Our AMA continues to advocate for policies that would allow patients and physicians to be able to 21 choose from a range of public and private coverage options with the goal of providing coverage to 22 all Americans. Speci fically, our AMA has been working with Congress, the Administration, and 23 states to advance our plan to cover the uninsured and improve affordability as included in the 24 \"2022 and Beyond: AMA's Plan to Cover the Uninsured .\" The COVID-19 pandemic initially led 25 to many people losing their employer-bas ed health insurance . This only increased the need for 26 signi ficant improvements to the Affordable Care Act. Recent data indicate that the uninsured rate 27 has decreased during the COVID -19 pandemic, due to the temporary ACA improvements included 28 in the American Rescue Plan Act, continuous Medicaid enrollment, and state Medicaid expansions . 29 30 We also continue to examine the pros and cons of a broad array of approaches to achieve universal 31 coverage as the policy debate evolves. 32 33 Our AMA has been advocating for the following policy provisions: 34 35 Cover Uninsured Eligible for ACA's Premium Tax Credits 36 37 Our AMA advocates for increasing the generosity of premium tax credits to improve premium 38 affordability and incentivize tax credit eligible individuals to get covered. Currently, eligible 39 individuals and families with incomes between 100 and 400 percent federal poverty level 40 B of T Rep. 06-A-23 -- page 2 of 6 (FPL) (133 and 400 percent in Medicaid expansion states) are being provided with refundable 1 and advanceable premium tax credits to purchase coverage on health insurance exchanges. 2 Our AMA has been advocating for enhanced premium tax credits for young adults . In order to 3 improve insurance take-up rates among young adults and help balance the individual health 4 insurance market risk pool, young adults ages 19 to 30 who are eligible for advance premium 5 tax credits could be provided with \"enhanced\" premium tax credits \u2014such as an additional $50 6 per month \u2014while maintaining the current premium tax credit structure that is inversely related 7 to income, as well as the current 3:1 age rating ratio. 8 Our AMA is also advocating for an expan sion of the eligibility for and increasing the size of 9 cost-sharing reductions. Currently, individuals and families with incomes between 100 and 250 10 percent FPL (between 133 and 250 percent FPL in Medicaid expansion states) also qualify for 11 cost-sharing subsidies if they select a silver plan, which leads to lower deductibles, out-of- 12 pocket maximums, copayments, and other cost-sharing amounts. Extending eligibility for cost- 13 sharing reductions beyond 250 percent FPL, and increasing the size of cost-sharing reductions, 14 would lessen the cost-sharing burdens many individuals face, which impact their ability to 15 access and afford the care they need . 16 17 Cover Uninsured Eligible for Medicaid or C hildren 's Health Insurance Program 18 19 Before the COVID -19 pandemic, i n 2018, 6.7 million of the nonelderly uninsured were eligible for 20 Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP ). Reasons for this population 21 remaining uninsured include lack of awareness of eligibility or assistance in enrollment . 22 23 Our AMA has been advocating for increasing and improving Medicaid/CHIP outreach and 24 enrollment , including auto enrollment. 25 Our AMA has been oppos ing efforts to establish Medicaid work requirements . The AMA 26 believes that Medicaid work requirements would negatively affect access to care and lead to 27 significant negative consequences for individuals' health and well -being. 28 29 Make Coverage More Affordable for People Not Eligible for ACA's Premium Tax Credits 30 31 Before the COVID -19 pandemic, i n 2018, 5.7 million of the nonelderly uninsured were ineligible 32 for financial assistance under the ACA, either due to their income, or because they have an offer of 33 \"affordable\" employer -sponsored health insurance coverage. Without the assistance provided by 34 ACA's premium tax credits, this population can continue to face unaffordable premiums and 35 remain uninsured. 36 37 Our AMA advocates for eliminating the subsidy \"cliff,\" thereby expanding eligibility for 38 premium tax credits beyond 400 percent FPL. 39 Our AMA has been advocating for the establishment of a permanent federal reinsurance 40 program, and the use of Section 1332 waivers for state reinsurance programs. Reinsurance 41 plays a role in stabilizing premiums by reducing the incentive for insurers to charge higher 42 premiums across the board in anticipation of higher- risk people enrolling in coverage. Section 43 1332 waivers have also been approved to provide funding for state reinsurance programs . 44 Our AMA also is advocating for lowering the threshold that determines whether an employee 's 45 premium contribution is \"affordable,\" allowing more employees to become eligible for 46 premium tax credits to purchase marketplace coverage. 47 O ur AMA strongly advocat ed for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) proposed regulation on 48 April 7, 2022 that would fix the so- called \"family glitch\" under the ACA, whereby families of 49 workers remain ineligible for subsidized ACA marketplace coverage even though they face 50 B of T Rep. 06-A-23 -- page 3 of 6 unaffordabl e premiums for health insurance coverage offered through employers. The 1 proposed regulation would fix the family glitch by extending eligibility for ACA financial 2 assistance to only the family members of workers who are not offered affordable job -based 3 family coverage. T he Biden Administration finalize d the proposed rule on October 13, 2022. 4 5 EXPAND MEDICAID TO COVER MORE PEOPLE 6 7 Before the COVID -19 pandemic, i n 2018, 2.3 million of the nonelderly uninsured found 8 themselves in the coverage gap\u2014not eligible for Medicaid, and not eligible for tax credits because 9 they reside in states that did not expand Medicaid . Without access to Medicaid, these individuals 10 do not have a pathway to affordable coverage . 11 12 Our AMA has been encouraging all states to expand Medicaid eligibility to 133 percent FPL. 13 14 New policy adopted by the AMA H OD during the November 2021 Special Meeting seeks to assist 15 more than two million nonelderly uninsured individuals who fall into the \" coverage gap \" in states 16 that have not expa nded Medicaid\u2014 those with incomes above Medicaid eligibility limits but below 17 the FPL, which is the lower limit for premium tax credit eligibility. The new AMA policy 18 maintains that coverage should be extended to these individuals at little or no cost, and further 19 specifies that states that have already expanded Medicaid coverage should receive additional 20 incentives to maintain that status going forward. 21 22 AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN OF 2021 23 24 On March 11, 2021, President Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan (ARP A) of 2021. 25 This legislation included the following ACA -related provisions that will : 26 27 Provide a temporary (two- year) 5 percent increase in the Federal Medical Assistance 28 Percent age (FMAP) for Medicaid to states that enact the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid 29 expansion and covers the new enrollment period per requirements of the ACA. 30 Invest nearly $35 billion in premium subsidy increases for those who buy coverage on the 31 ACA marketp lace. 32 Expand the availability of ACA advanced premium tax credits (APTCs) to individuals whose 33 income is above 400 percent of the FPL for 2021 and 2022. 34 Give an option for states to provide 12- month postpartum coverage under State Medicaid and 35 CHIP. 36 37 ARPA represents the largest coverage expansion since the Affordable Care Act. Under the ACA, 38 eligible individuals, and families with incomes between 100 and 400 percent of the FPL (between 39 133 and 400 percent FPL in Medicaid expansion states) have been provided with refundable and 40 advanceable premium credits that are inversely related to income to purchase coverage on health 41 insurance exchanges. However, consistent with Policy H -165.824, \"Improving Affordability in the 42 Health Insurance Exchanges,\" ARPA eliminated ACA's subsidy \"cliff\" for 2021 and 2022. As a 43 result, individuals and families with incomes above 400 percent FPL ($51,520 for an individual 44 and $106,000 for a family of four based on 2021 federal poverty guidelines) are eligible for 45 premium ta x credit assistance. Individuals eligible for premium tax credits include individuals who 46 are offered an employer plan that does not have an actuarial value of at least 60 percent or if the 47 employee share of the premium exceeds 9.83 percent of income in 2021. 48 B of T Rep. 06-A-23 -- page 4 of 6 Consistent with Policy H -165.824, ARPA also increased the generosity of premium tax credits for 1 two years, lowering the cap on the percentage of income individuals are required to pay for 2 premiums of the benchmark ( second lowest -cost silver) plan. Pr emiums of the second lowest -cost 3 silver plan for individuals with incomes at and above 400 percent FPL are capped at 8.5 percent of 4 their income. Notably, resulting from the changes, eligible individuals and families with incomes 5 between 100 and 150 percent of the FPL (133 percent and 150 percent FPL in Medicaid expansion 6 states) now qualify for zero -premium silver plans, effective until the end of 2022. 7 8 In addition, individuals and families with incomes between 100 and 250 percent FPL (between 133 9 and 250 percent FPL in Medicaid expansion states) also qualify for cost -sharing subsidies if they 10 select a silver plan, which reduces their deductibles, out -of-pocket maximums, copayments, and 11 other cost -sharing amounts. 12 13 LEGISLATIVE EXTENSION OF ARPA PROVISION S 14 15 On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 through 16 the highly partisan budget reconciliation process, which allows both the House and Senate to pass 17 the bill with limits on procedural delays. Most significantly, reconciliation allows the Senate to 18 bypass the filibuster and pass legislation with a 50- vote threshold so long as it meets a series of 19 budgetary requirements. The Inflation Reduction Act include d provisions that extended for three 20 years to 2025 the af orementioned ACA premium subsidies authorized in ARPA. 21 22 The Inflation Reduction Act did not include provisions to close the Medicaid \"coverage gap\" in the 23 states that have not chosen to expand. 24 25 ACA ENROLLMENT 26 27 According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), 16.3 million Americans 28 have signed up for or were automatically re -enrolled in the 2023 individual market health insurance 29 coverage through the m arketplaces since the start of the 2022 Marketplace Open Enrollment Period 30 (OEP) on November 1, 202 2, through January 15, 202 3. 31 32 TEXAS VS. AZAR SUPREME COURT CASE 33 34 The Supreme Court agreed on March 2, 2020, to address the constitutionality of the ACA for the 35 third time, granting the petitions for certiorari from Democratic Attorneys General and the House 36 of Representatives. Oral arguments were presented on November 1 0, 2020, and a decision was 37 expected before June 2021. The AMA filed an amicus brief in support of the Act and the 38 petitioners in this case. 39 40 On February 10, 2021, the U.S. Department of Justice under the new Biden Administration 41 submitted a letter to the Supreme Court arguing that the ACA's individual mandate remains valid, 42 and, even if the court determines it is not, the rest of the law can remain intact. 43 44 This action reversed the Trump Administration's brief it filed with the Court asking the justices to 45 overturn the ACA in its entirety. The Trump Administration had clarified that the Court could 46 choose to leave some ACA provisions in place if they do not harm the plaintiffs, but as legal 47 experts pointed out, the entire ACA would be struck down if the Court rules that the law is 48 inseparable from the individual mandate\u2014 meaning that there would be no provisions left to 49 selectively enforce. 50 B of T Rep. 06-A-23 -- page 5 of 6 On June 17, 2021, the Supreme Court in a 7- 2 decision ruled that neither the states nor the 1 individuals challenging the law have a legal standing to sue. The Court did not touch on the larger 2 issue in the case: whether the entirety of the ACA was rendered unconstitutional when Congress 3 eliminated the penalty for failing to obtain health insurance. 4 5 With its legal status n ow affirmed by three Supreme Court decisions, and provisions such as 6 coverage for preventive services and pre -existing conditions woven into the fabric of U.S. health 7 care, the risk of future lawsuits succeeding in overturning the ACA is significantly dimi nished. 8 9 BRAIDWOOD MANAGEMENT VS. BECCERRA FEDERAL COURT CASE 10 11 A case before a federal district court judge in the Northern District of Texas, Braidwood v. Becerra 12 (formerly Kelley v. Becerra ), would eliminate the ACA requirement that most health insuran ce 13 plans cover preventive services without copayments. Those filing the case object to paying for 14 coverage that they do not want or need, particularly for those items or services that violate their 15 religious beliefs, such as contraception or PrEP drugs. If the case is ultimately successful, health 16 plan enrollees will also lose access to full coverage for dozens of preventive health services, 17 including vaccinations and screenings for breast cancer, colorectal cancer, cervical cancer, heart 18 disease, and other diseases and medical conditions. 19 20 The AMA and 61 national physician specialty organizations issued a joint s tatement on July 25, 21 2022, sounding the alarm about the millions of privately insured patients who would be affected by 22 an adverse ruling. 23 24 On September 7, 2022, Texas federal court judge Reed O'Connor ruled that part of the ACA's 25 requirement that health p lans cover preventive services without copayments was unconstitutional. 26 He further held that that one of the plaintiffs, Braidwood Management, a for -profit company, could 27 not be required to cover PrEP through its employer health plan because of Braidwood's religious 28 objections. Judge O'Conner did not immediately issue an order blocking enforcement of the 29 coverage requirements. He also did not specify whether such an order would be nationwide, for his 30 district only, for all the named plaintiffs, or only for Braidwood. These issues were held for further 31 argument before Judge O'Connor. 32 33 On November 30, 2022, the Litigation Center of the American Medical Association and State 34 Medical Societies, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American 35 Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Family Physicians, and four other national 36 associations filed an amicus brief warning against the court ordering broad, nationwide relief, 37 arguing that such a decision would imperil access to vital preven tive care that keeps patients 38 healthier and lowers overall costs for the health care system. 39 40 On March 30, 2023, after supplemental briefing from the parties and amici , the federal district 41 court issued its opinion and order addressing the remedies and final judgment. Most notably, the 42 court ordered that all actions taken by HHS to implement or enforce the preventive care coverage 43 requirements in response to an \"A\" or \"B\" recommendation by the U.S. Preventive Services Task 44 Force on or after March 23, 2010 a re vacated and enjoined going forward. The court also ordered 45 that the named plaintiffs need not comply with the PrEP mandate, based on the court's prior ruling 46 that the PrEP mandate violates the plaintiffs' rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration A ct. 47 On March 31, the federal government filed its notice of appeal, and the litigation will continue. 48 49 B of T Rep. 06-A-23 -- page 6 of 6 In a statement following the ruling, AMA President Jack Resneck, Jr., M.D., expressed alarm at the 1 ruling and urge d employers and insurers to maintain th is first dollar coverage while legislative and 2 judicial next steps are considered . 3 4 SGR REPEAL 5 6 The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA) of 2015 repealing and replacing 7 the SGR was signed into law by President Obama on April 16, 2015. 8 9 The AMA is now working on unrelated new Medicare payment reduction threats and is currently 10 advocating for a sustainable, inflation -based, automatic positive update system for physicians. 11 INDEPENDENT PAYMENT ADVISORY BOARD REPEAL 12 13 The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 signed into law by President Trump on February 9, 2018, 14 included provisions repealing IPAB. Currently , there are no t any legislative efforts in Congress to 15 replace the IPAB. 16 17 CONCL USION 18 19 Our American Medical Association will remain engaged in efforts to improve the health care 20 system through policies outlined in Policy D-165. 938 and other directives of the House of 21 Delegates . Given that most of the ACA fixes that led to calls in 2013 for this report at every HOD 22 meeting have been accomplished, our primary goal now related to health care r eform is 23 stabilization of the broken Medicare physician payment system, including the need for inflat ion- 24 based positive annual updates and reform of budget neutrality rules. 25 \u00a9 2023 American Medical Association.

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES B of T Report 0 7-A-23 Subject: AMA Performance, Activities, and Status in 2022 Presented by: Sandra Adamson Fryhofer, MD, Chair Policy G -605.050, \"Annual Reporting Responsibilities of the AMA Board of Trustees,\" calls for 1 the Board of Trustees to submit a report at the American Medical Association (AMA) Annual 2 Meeting each year summarizing AMA performance, activities, and status for the prior year. 3 4 INTRODUCTION 5 6 The AMA's mission is to promote the art and science of medicine and the betterment of public 7 health. As the physician organization whose reach and depth extend across all physicians, as well 8 as policymakers, medical schools, and health care leaders, the AMA uniquely can deliver results 9 and initiatives that enable physicians to improve the health of the nation. 10 11 Representing physicians with a unified voice 12 13 In a year that marked the organization's 175th anniversary, the AMA launched the Recovery Plan 14 for Am erica's Physicians, a five- point strategy to support and strengthen our nation's physician 15 workforce. The plan was i ntroduced at the Annual Meeting of the AMA House of Delegates in 16 June 2022. The five objectives of the plan focus on prior authorization, Medicare payment reform, 17 scope of practice creep , physician burnout and telehealth . 18 19 The AMA has been leading a multiyear effort to bring about Medicare payment models that give 20 physicians greater flexibility in care delivery, minimize administrative burdens that detract from 21 patient care, and improve the financial viability of physician practices. In 2022, we led a robust 22 advocacy campaign that was joined by more than 150 organizations representing more than 1 23 million physicians that minimiz ed the 8.5% Medic are physician payment cuts slated for 2023. In 24 addition, AMA advocacy efforts helped secure a two -year postponement of the 4% cuts from the 25 pay-as-you-go sequester tied to the American Rescue Plan Act 26 27 The AMA scored more than 40 state -level victories by working in partnership with state medical 28 associations and national medical specialty societies. Pressing the fight for patient safety, we 29 stopped bills that would have expanded the scope of practice for nurse practitioners and other 30 APRNs, he lped defeat legislation nationwide that would have allowed physician assistants to 31 practice independently without physician oversight, and turned away measures allowing 32 pharmacists to prescribe medications and optometrists to perform surgery. 33 34 The AMA con tinues to aggressively urge the Department of Veterans Affairs to reject the 35 inappropriate scope of practice expansions outlined in the Federal Supremacy Project while 36 advocating as strongly as ever in favor of physician- led teams and against improper scope 37 expansions in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. 38 39 In cases ranging from COVID -19 standards of care and firearm regulations to climate change and 40 transgender rights, the AMA continued to fight for physicians and patients in state and federal 41 B of T Rep. 0 7-A-23 -- page 2 of 4 courts in 2022. The AMA was a plaintiff in African American Tobacco Control Leadership 1 Council v. HHS, which forced the federal government to take the first steps toward banning 2 menthol cigarettes. And in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's Dobbs v. Jackson W omen's 3 Health Organization decision, the AMA joined numerous briefs outlining the need for access to 4 reproductive care and opposing third- party interference in the patient -physician relationship. 5 6 The AMA elevated the voice of physician leadership on criti cal issues of public health, securing 7 more than 175 billion media impressions representing nearly $1.6 billion in estimated ad value and 8 achieving a commanding 43 percent share of voice among healthcare entities in the media . 9 10 Removing obstacles that inte rfere with patient care 11 12 The Improving Seniors' Timely Access to Care Act, the bipartisan effort to ease prior authorization 13 burdens under the Medicare Advantage program, garnered 326 co- sponsors before it was passed by 14 the U.S. House of Representatives in September. Its provisions were developed from the consensus 15 statement on prior authorization reform that the AMA helped draft. 16 17 The AMA represented the interests of physicians in a federal regulatory task force exploring 18 methods to streamline the prior a uthorization process. The AMA also played a key role in the 19 successful adoption of prior authorization reform laws in Georgia, Iowa and Michigan, and paved 20 the way for reform efforts in 2023 in nearly a dozen more states . 21 22 The AMA authored or co -authored a record 27 peer -reviewed journal articles and research reports 23 in 2022 relating to physician burnout and improving professional satisfaction and practice 24 sustainability. T he AMA helped secure the enactment of the Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Provider 25 Protection Act, which enables a broad range of essential physician wellness resources, including 26 evidence -based programs dedicated to improving mental health and resiliency. 27 28 The AMA STEPS Forward\u00ae Program exceeded 1.6 million lifetime users with new training 29 programs that included two more playbooks, two new and 17 updated toolkits, 26 podcasts and 30 four videos. 31 32 The AMA expanded its work in promoting physician wellness through its Joy in Medicine 33 Health System Recognition Program, honoring nearly 30 health care organizations that represented 34 more than 80,000 physicians. 35 36 The AMA expanded its national Behavioral Health Collaborative with the launch of the Behavioral 37 Health Integration Immersion Prog ram, a 12 -month curriculum that provides enhanced technical 38 assistance to physician practices seeking to deliver integrated care to patients. This effort builds on 39 the success of the Overcoming Obstacles series with several new webinars on topics such as 40 assembling a behavioral health integration care team and addressing physician and patient mental 41 health. 42 43 Driving the future of medicine 44 45 The AMA played a key role in securing passage of legislation to extend Medicare telehealth 46 flexibilities through the en d of 2024. We launched model legislation that states can use to advance 47 telehealth coverage and policies. The AMA further supported telehealth expansion by expanding 48 our already- impressive library of print and online resources promoting evidence -based tel ehealth 49 services to now include strategies to advance health equity in virtual care . The launch of the 50 AMA's Telehealth Immersion Program support s practices in the implementation and optimization 51 B of T Rep. 0 7-A-23 -- page 3 of 4 of telehealth . The program expanded in 2022 with seven webin ars, five clinical case studies, two 1 virtual panel discussions and one mini bootcamp. 2 3 The industry- leading AMA Ed Hub online education portal received 6 million view s and 4 continued to expand its programs, affiliations and reach to support live broadcasts and enhance 5 multimedia capabilities . The number of external education providers grew by 10 to encompass 35 6 organizations with the addition of the American Board of Pediatrics and the American Academy of 7 Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, among others. 8 9 The AMA, led by its Center for Health Equity, streng thened its physician engagement with the 10 launch of seven new social justice education modules published on the AMA Ed Hub learning 11 platform. These modules focus on strategies to advance equity through quality and safety 12 improvements to the historical foundations of racism in medicine. In addition, the AMA's popular 13 \"Prioritizing Equity\" webinar series grew to 28 episodes, with new features on voting, health 14 equity and reproductive care as a human right. 15 16 The AMA helped launch the \"In Full Health Learning and Action Community to Advance 17 Equitable Health in Innovation\" initiative, building upon the expertise of 17 external collaborations 18 to create three AMA Ed Hub learning modules and the \"Equitable Health Innovation Solutions\" 19 toolkit. 20 21 Building on the AMA 's commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, the AMA Graduate 22 Medical Education Competency Education Program and the AMA Undergraduate Medical 23 Education Curricular Enrichment Program launched a series of health equity educational courses: 24 \"Social Dete rminants of Health,\" \"Basics of Health and three courses in the \"Racism in 25 Medicine\" series. 26 27 First published in March 2022 as part of the AMA's MedEd Innovation Series, \"Coaching in 28 Medical Education\" quickly sold out. Now in its second printing, this instructor -focused guide 29 outlines a scientific foundation for coaching competency and has ranked in the top 100 of medical 30 education and training books since its release. The AMA also published \"Protecting the Education 31 Mission During Sustained Disr uption\" in 2022, a report that explores organizational strategies to 32 support educators amid extreme stress and which formed the basis of the Educator Well -Being in 33 Academic Medicine book published in December. 34 35 The AMA released a special 175th anniversary edition of its Code of Medical Ethics, and the 36 Journal of the American Medical Association, under the direction of new Editor -in-Chief Kirsten 37 Bibbins -Domingo, MD, PhD, MAS, maintained its place among the world's preeminent medical 38 journals. All 12 special ty publications from the JAMA Network ranked among the top 10 in 39 journal Impact Factor, with eight ranking in the top three for their respective specialties. 40 41 The launch of the AMA's new Current Procedural Terminology (CPT\u00ae) Developer Program 42 helped creators of health technology and services utilize the code set for their transformative 43 innovations. The new self -service portal g ives physicians the ability to lic ense CPT code sets 44 through a simple pay model, including new codes introduced in 2022 relating to the m pox outbreak 45 and ongoing releases for specific COVID -19 vaccines . 46 47 The AMA relaunched its popular Physician Innovation Network digital platform, which now has 48 more than 18,000 collaborators and 30 industry partners, to improve user experience and more 49 effectively connect physicians with technology innovators. 50 B of T Rep. 0 7-A-23 -- page 4 of 4 Leading the charge to c onfront public health cris es 1 2 The AMA expanded its health equity investments with the launch of the Rise to Health: A National 3 Coalition for Equity in Health Care, an effort that unites individuals and organizations in shared 4 solutions for high- impact structural change, and with a $3 million multi -year investment in 5 Chicago's West Side United, a community -based collaborative that is addressing determinants of 6 health and helping restore economic vitality on the city's West Side. 7 8 The AMA developed a mpox resource page to provide physicians with updated information on 9 testing access, vaccines and therapeutics, and worked with the FDA and CDC on a webinar 10 detailing the tecovirimat (TPOXX) antiviral. And the AMA collaborated on the annual \"Get My 11 Flu Shot\" campaign, with a specific focus on reaching Black and Latinx populatio ns and kept 12 physicians and the public up to date on the latest pandemic developments, including therapeutics 13 and the importance of staying up to date with COVID -19 vaccines. 14 15 To close the gap in blood pressure management training within medical schools, th e AMA 16 launched a three -part eLearning series, supported by a one -year grant program to monitor the 17 impact of this new training. AMA policy guidance led to four states increasing access to Medicaid 18 programs for self -measured blood pressure by covering home -use devices and clinical support 19 services. Additionally, the AMA also helped train more than 100 community health workers to 20 help Chicago's West Side residents more accurately measure their blood pressure at home. 21 22 The AMA's Substance Use and Pain Care Tas k Force continues to advance evidence -based 23 recommendations for policymakers and physicians to help end the nation's drug- related overdose 24 and death epidemic . The AMA and Manatt Health 2022 State Toolkit identifies more than 400 state 25 laws, regulations, an d policy guidance to help end the nation's drug overdose epidemic. 26 27 The AMA's Enterprise Social Responsibility (ESR) program continues to deliver an organized and 28 thoughtful structure to engage AMA employees in public service work aligned with the 29 organiz ation's values and goals. The program has strategically integrated with the Center for 30 Health Equity's strategic plan to support healthy, thriving, equitable communities. Thirty percent of 31 AMA employees, representing every business unit and office location, supported nearly 80 32 organizations and donated $160,000 to community partners. 33 34 Membership 35 36 Following 11 consecutive years of membership growth, in 2022 the AMA experienced a small 37 decrease in overall membership (due to a drop in student numbers), but physician membership 38 remained steady. Overall, the organization's advocacy efforts and mission activities were supported 39 by another strong year of financial performance. 40 41 EVP Compensation 42 43 During 2022, pursuant to his employment agreement, total cash compensation paid to James L. 44 Madara, MD, as AMA Executive Vice President was $1,281,270 in salary and $1,220,904 in 45 incentive compensation, reduced by $2,632 in pre -tax deductions. Other taxable amounts per the 46 contract are as follows: $151,198 distributi on from a deferred compensation plan; $23,484 imputed 47 costs for life insurance, $24,720 imputed costs for executive life insurance, and $3,650 paid for an 48 executive physical, and $3,519 paid for parking and other. An $81,000 contribution to a deferred 49 comp ensation account was also made by the AMA. This will not be taxable until vested and paid 50 pursuant to provisions in the deferred compensation agreement.

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES B of T Report 08 -A-23 Subject: Annual Update on Activities and Progress in Tobacco Control: March 202 2 through February 202 3 Presented by: Sandra Adamson Fryhofer, MD, Chair This report summarizes trends and news on tobacco usage, policies, and tobacco control advocacy 1 activities from March 2022 through February 2023. The report is written pursuant to AMA Policy 2 D-490.983, \"Annual Tobacco Report.\" 3 4 TOBACCO USE AT A GLANCE 5 6 Tobacco control efforts are often heralded as a roadmap for advocates addressing other health 7 behaviors associated with negative health outcomes. The successes of those efforts to reduce the 8 tobacco- related harms cannot be diminished; however, tobacco remains the leading cause of 9 preventable disease, disability, and death in the United States.1 According to the Centers for 10 Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) tobacco kills more than 480,000 people annually. Based on 11 2020 data, an estimated 31 million U.S. adults smoke cigarettes, and each day 1600 youth under 18 12 years old smoke their first cigarette. More than 16 million people live with at least one disease 13 caused by smoking.2 14 15 Youth Tobacco Use Associated with Social Determinants of Health Inequities 16 17 The National Youth Tobacco Sur vey (NYTS) is a cross -sectional, voluntary, school -based, self - 18 administered survey of U.S. middle and high school students. In 2022, the survey was conducted 19 using an online survey. A total of 28,291 students from 341 schools participated, yielding an 20 overall response rate of 45.2%.3 21 22 An analysis of the 2022 NYTS estimates 3 million (4.5% of middle school students and 16.5% of 23 high school students ) currently use any tobacco product including electronic cigarettes (e - 24 cigarettes) . E-cigarettes are the most commonly used tobacco product by students . Three percent of 25 middle school students and 14% of high school students reported current use of e-cigarettes. NYTS 26 defines current tobacco use as one or more of any commercial tobacco product on 1 day during 27 the past 30 days.3 28 29 For the first time since the initial survey in 1999, estimates for Asian, American Indian or Alaska 30 Native (AI/AN), Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander (NH/OPI), and multiracial population 31 groups were provided. The report states, \"Whereas AI/AN students reported the highest prevalence 32 of current use of any tobacco product, curre nt use of any combustible tobacco product, specifically 33 cigar and hookah use, was highest among Black students. In addition, current use of any tobacco 34 product was higher among those students identifying as LGB [lesbian, gay, bisexual] or 35 transgender, thos e reporting severe psychological distress, those with low family affluence, and 36 those with low academic achievement.\"3 37 B of T Rep. 08 -A-23 -- page 2 of 5 The inequities suggest the impact of the continued aggressive marketing by tobacco companies a nd 1 e-cigarette manufacturers to specific populations. 2 3 Because of changes in methodology, including differences in survey administration and data 4 collection procedures, the ability to compare estimates from 2022 with those from previous NYTS 5 waves is limi ted. However, the cross -sectional data provided by the 2022 survey are still valid and 6 informative.3 7 8 Adult Tobacco Use 9 10 Adult tobacco use has continued to decline with an estimated 19% of U.S. adults reporting current 11 use of any commercial tobacco product according to the 2020 National Health Interview Survey 12 (NHIS) compared to 21% reported in 2019. NHIS is an annual, nationally representative household 13 survey of the noninstitutionalized U.S. civilian population. Current use is defined by NHIS as 14 having reported use of these products every day or some days at the time of survey. While e- 15 cigarettes are the most common tobacco product of youth, an estimated 80% of adults reported 16 using combustible products (cigarettes, cigars and pipes).4 17 18 The CDC report shows inequities in adults who smoke and use tobacco in the U.S. According to 19 the report groups with high rates of smoking include people with lower income and less education , 20 AI/AN adults, residents of the Midwest and South, residents of rural areas, LGB adults, and adults 21 who regularly had feelings of anxiety or depression. Adults who are uninsured or enrolled in 22 Medicaid sm oke at more than double the rates of those with private health insurance or Medicare.4 23 24 Among all tobacco products, combustible products are the predominate cause of tobacco related 25 morbidity and mortality indicating that policies directed at these products remain a high priority.5 26 These policies should focus on providing access to evidence -based treatments for tobacco 27 dependence and disincentives to smoking such as increases in taxes.4 28 29 EFFORTS TO ADDRESS TOBACCO CONTROL 30 31 ALA Releases its 2023 State of Tobacco Report 32 33 The American Lung Association (ALA) \"State of Tobacco Control\" report evaluates state and 34 federal policies on actions taken to eliminate tobacco use and recommends proven -effective 35 tobacco control laws and policies. The report provides letter grades to five interventions. At the 36 federal level grades are given for regulation of tobacco products, coverage for smoking cessation, 37 taxes, mass media campaigns and minimum sales age. At the state level the report evaluates 38 smokefree workplace laws, sales of flavored tobacco products, state program funding, tobacco 39 taxes, and access cessation services. 40 41 According to the American Lung Association's 2023 State of Tobacco Report, the Federal 42 government took major steps toward regulating tobacco products in 2022 but fel l short in coverage 43 of quit smoking treatments and increasing federal taxes. The states with the highest overall grades 44 were California, District of Columbia, and Massachusetts. The report shows how widely tobacco 45 policies vary from state to state. For exa mple, some states still allow smoking in workplaces 46 including restaurants and bars, and some states lack Medicaid coverage for tobacco cessation. 47 Alabama, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Texas were states with the most need to enact evidence- 48 based policie s. 49 B of T Rep. 08 -A-23 -- page 3 of 5 The report also highlights the need to continue funding programs like the CDC's Tips From Former 1 Smokers\u00ae (Tips\u00ae) campaign launched in 2012. The campaign profiles real people from many 2 different backgrounds living with serious long- term health effects from smoking and secondhand 3 smoke exposure. State level funding for cessation efforts also should be prioritized as well as 4 efforts to provide support for community- level engagements in addressing inequities .6 5 6 AMA Joins with Public Health Groups to Prot ect Tobacco Regulation and Funding 7 8 The CDC Office on Smoking and Health (OSH) has a proven track record in developing programs, 9 initiatives and resources that have reduced the social, medical, and economic tolls associated with 10 tobacco in the U.S. Dedicat ed and increased funding is needed by for OSH to support ongoing 11 research that contributes to the development of innovative interventions in tobacco prevention and 12 cessation. 13 14 In April 2022 the AMA signed on to a letter calling on the House of Representat ives 15 Appropriations Committee to increase funding for OSH by $68.5 million, for a total of $310 16 million. 17 18 In June 2022, when members of the House of Representative's Committee on Appropriations were 19 reviewing the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and D rug Administration, and Related 20 Agencies Appropriations bill the public health community raised concerns that the bill would 21 include language weakening FDA's authority over tobacco. The AMA was one of 70 22 organizations, including Federation members American Thoracic Society, American Academy of 23 Pediatrics and American College of Cardiology, who signed a letter to the Committee calling on 24 them to ensure that FDA has the unfettered ability to protect youth from unscrupulous marketing of 25 any and all tobacco products. 26 27 These letters were part of a comprehensive strategy to ensure that the tobacco industry and others 28 have limited influence in weakening the strides made in tobacco control while being prepared for 29 new threats to public health in the future. 30 31 Suprem e Court Upholds California Law Banning Flavored Tobacco Products 32 33 In 2020, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed Senate Bill 793 into law. This law prohibited 34 the sale of menthol cigarettes and most flavored tobacco products. The law was immediately 35 challenged and thus began a two- year legal battle by R.J. Reynolds who sued the state of California 36 and effectively delayed implementation until the law could be considered in a ballot referendum in 37 2022. In November 2022, California voters overwhelmingly supported the 2020 law with more 38 than 60% voting yes on the referendum. 39 40 R.J. Reynolds and other tobacco entities immediately appealed to the Supreme Court, requesting an 41 emergency injunction against California's law arguing that the Federal Tobacco Control Act 42 prohibited California from enacting its flavored tobacco law. The AMA joined with public health 43 groups and other medical associations in an amicus brief opposing R.J. Reynolds ' emergency 44 application. On December 12, the Supreme Court denied the suit and on December 21, California 45 became the second state to ban the sale of flavored tobacco products and menthol cigarettes. 46 Massachusetts was the first state to ban flavors and menthol in 2019. 47 B of T Rep. 08 -A-23 -- page 4 of 5 FDA Takes Steps to Remove Menthol 1 2 On April 28, 2022, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released two proposed rules on 3 characterizing flavors in tobacco products. One of the proposed rules would ban menthol and all 4 characterizing flavors such as strawberry flavor in cigarettes, an d the other proposed rule would 5 prohibit menthol in cigars. This news was treated with great support from public health groups, but 6 it came after years of inaction by the FDA. The long- overdue action follows a lawsuit filed in 2020 7 by the African American Tobacco Control Leadership Council, Action on Smoking and Health, 8 AMA, and National Medical Association. 9 10 According to a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration study, \"85% of non- 11 Hispanic Black and African American adults who smoke pref er menthol cigarettes, and menthol 12 flavoring in cigarettes and e -cigarettes make it easier for youth to initiate smoking.\"7 \"It is 13 estimated that nearly 1 million Americans \u2014and about 230,000 African Americans \u2014would quit 14 smoking within 13 to 17 months of a ban on menthol cigarettes taking effect.\"8 15 16 FDA has announced that the final rules will be released sometime in 2023. Barring any delay from 17 the anticipated lawsuits from the tobacco industry, products will have to be removed within one 18 year. 19 20 Congress Closes Loophole in FDA Authority 21 22 In March, Congress took action to expand the FDA's regulatory authority over tobacco products 23 using synthetic nicotine. FDA's authority to regulate nicotine in tobacco products was previously 24 limited to tobacco -derived ni cotine. This specificity created a loophole for manufacturers including 25 Puff Bar to reintroduce their e -cigarette with synthetic nicotine when ordered to take their flavored 26 tobacco- derived product off the market. Congress closed this loophole by allowing the FDA to 27 regulate nicotine regardless of the source. Several state and local jurisdictions have already passed 28 similar laws; however, having a federal framework in place allows for a more comprehensive 29 approach. 30 31 Despite this promising measure, the FDA has yet to take significant enforcement actions against 32 companies still selling unauthorized synthetic nicotine products. Tribal, state, local, and territorial 33 governments can and should move forward to implement their own laws where necessary and 34 ensure th at synthetic nicotine is included in their tobacco control efforts. 35 36 FDA and DoJ Take Actions Against Manufacturers 37 38 Starting in September 2020, all tobacco product manufacturers are required to submit a premarket 39 application and receive authorization from the FDA before introducing a new tobacco product into 40 the market. In accordance with its regulatory authority, the FDA issued warning letters to two 41 brands of e -cigarettes doing business as Puff Bar for \"receiving and delivering e -cigarettes\" 42 without a ma rketing authorization order. The agency also issued marketing denial orders for 32 43 premarket tobacco applications, because they \"lacked sufficient evidence demonstrating that these 44 flavored e -cigarettes would provide a benefit to adult users that would be adequate to outweigh the 45 risks to youth.\" 46 47 In October 2022 the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) , on behalf of the FDA, filed for permanent 48 injunctions against six e -cigarette manufacturers on behalf of the FDA. According to the FDA, this 49 action represents the first time that the agency has begun injunction proceedings to enforce 50 premarket review requirements under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. 51 B of T Rep. 08 -A-23 -- page 5 of 5 Each of the six defendants \u2014Lucky's Convenience & Tobacco LLC doing business as Lucky's 1 Vape & Smoke Shop in the District of Kansas; Morin Enterprises Inc. doing business as E -Cig Crib 2 in the District of Minnesota; Seditious Vapours LLC doing business as Bu tt Out in the District of 3 Arizona; Soul Vapor LLC in the Southern District of West Virginia; Super Vape'z LLC in the 4 Western District of Washington and Vapor Craft LLC in the Middle District of Georgia \u2014illegally 5 manufactured, sold and distributed their products, even after receiving warnings from the FDA. 6 7 The defendants did not submit premarket applications for their e -cigarettes and subsequently 8 received a warning from the FDA. While most of the 300 companies that received warning labels 9 removed their products from the marketplace, the six defendants continued manufacturing, 10 distributing, and selling their products. 11 1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES B of T Report 10 -A-23 Subject: American Medical Association Health Equity Annual Report Presented by: Sandra Adamson Fryhofer, MD, Chair BACKGROUND 1 2 At the 2018 Annual Meeting, the House of Delegates adopted Policy D -180.981, direct ing our AMA to 3 \"develop an organizational unit, e.g., a Center or its equivalent, to facilitate, coordinate, initiate, and track 4 AMA health equity activities\" and instruct ing the \"Board to provide an annual report to the House of 5 Delegates regarding AMA's health equity activities and achievements.\" The HOD provided additional 6 guidance via Policy H -180.944: \"Health equity, defined as optimal health for all, is a goal toward which 7 our AMA will work by advocating for health care access, research, and data collection; promoting equity 8 in care; increasing health workforce diversity; influencing determinants of health; and voicing and 9 modeling commitment to health equity.\" HOD policy was followed by creation of the AMA Center for 10 Health Equity (\"Center\") in April 2019 and the AMA's Organizational Strategic Plan to Embed Racial 11 Justice and Advance Health Equity for 2021- 2023 (\"Plan\") in May 2021. In 2022, updated Policy H - 12 65.946 specif ied that this report will also include \" updates on [the AMA's] comprehensive diversity and 13 inclusion strategy.\" 14 15 DISCUSSION 16 17 Our AMA has committed itself to advanc ing health equity, advocating for racial and social justice, and 18 embedding equity across the organization and beyond. In 2022, the Center continued to collect enterprise - 19 wide equity related work and track progress toward the five strategic approaches detailed in the AMA's 20 Plan. This report outlines the activities conducted by our AMA during calendar year 2022, divided into 21 five strategic approaches detailed in the Plan: (1) Embed Equity; (2) Build Alliances and Share Power; (3) 22 Ensure Equity in Innovation; (4) Push Upstream; and (5) Foster Truth, Reconciliation, and Racial 23 Healing . The diversity and inclusion strategy updates are included within the Embed Equity section. 24 25 Embed Equity 26 27 Ensuring a lasting commitment to health equity by our AMA involves embedding equity using anti - 28 racism, structural competency, and trauma -informed lenses as a foundation for transform ing the AMA's 29 staff and broader culture, systems, policies, and practices, including training, tools, recruitment and 30 retention, contracts, budgeting, communications, publishing, and regular assessment of organizational 31 change. The following are some of the relevant accomplishments during 2022 : 32 33 The AMA engag ed 1,000,000 users of health equity- related content on the website, a +43% 34 increase over the prior year , by produc ing 108 new health equity- related articles or other content , 35 significantly more than any other year. The most consumed content included: (1) \"GME -These 36 courses create health equity champions in your Residency Program\" (193K users ), (2) \"2022 a 37 critical year to address the worsening drug overdose crisis\" (13K users), (3) \"The AMA's 38 Strategic plan to embed racial justice and advance health equity \" (11k users). 39 B of T Rep. 10 -A-23 -- page 2 of 11 The AMA incorporated health equity into the annual Medical Student Advocacy Conference 1 (MAC) and the annual Research Challeng e, which is the largest national, multi- specialty medical 2 research conference for medical students, residents and fellows, and international medical 3 graduates to showcase and present research. Changes included incorporating customized 4 diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) statements in Research Challenge marketing, reduc ing bias 5 in the R esearch Challenge abstract review process by removing author names , incorporat ing 6 subtitles in Research Challenge and MA C training videos, and produc ing an education session at 7 MAC on redefining social determinants of health in organized medicine. 8 The AMA continued to reflect its commitment to health equity in its messaging, speeches, and 9 announcements on an ongoing basis on various f ronts including the All -Employee Meeting, 10 Frontline Communicator Training, Board of Trustees message/media training, and beyond. 11 The AMA produced six Prioritizing Equity episodes (including voting and health and 12 reproductive health care as a human right) and eight podcast ep isodes ( five Stories of Care 13 episodes on health equity and infection control, two LGBT Q-themed episodes, and one episode 14 on embedding racial and health equity in health systems ), hosted 2 webinars on social 15 determinant s of health and racial and health equity for health systems , and published a STEPS 16 Forward toolkit (Racial and Health Equity: Concrete STEPS for Health Systems ) and five health - 17 equity centered issues of the Journal of Ethic s (Inequity Along the Medical/Dental Divide, 18 Toward Abolition Medicine, Health Equity in US Latinx Communities, Inequity and Iatrogenic 19 Harm , What We Owe Workers in Health Care Who Earn Low Wages) with a combined 1 million 20 unique journal website visitors during the months of th ose issues. 21 AMA Councils produced three reports including health equity considerations adopted by the 22 House of Delegates on pandemic ethics, rural public health, and climate change and public health. 23 The Board of Trustees produced two health -equity related reports adopted by the House of 24 Delegates on a global non- discrimination policy and language related to discrimination and 25 harassment . 26 AMA staff update d over 50 years of publication illustrations of patients in procedural 27 descriptions for the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) Pro Book. The 2023 CPT PRO Book 28 will have over 20 illustrations that reflect diversity in skin tones and ethnicity , with plans for 29 more in future years. 30 31 The AMA's e mployee life cycle and internal diversity, equity, and inclusion ( DEI) framework help to 32 operationalize DEI initi atives across the enterprise. Within embedding equity, updates on the AMA's 33 diversity and inclusion strategy include : 34 35 All of the AMA's business units (BUs) created their first annual equity action plans. 36 The AMA developed the second phase of its embedding equity curriculum , for launch in 2023, to 37 help staff practically apply inclusive skills . 38 The AMA developed dashboards including demographics of existing staff and new hires, with 39 data included in the annual report to AMA senior management. 40 The AMA continued to diversify its outside counsel legal spend by working with law firms 41 owned by Black attorneys, attorneys of color and/or women, some of whom are members of the 42 National Association of Minority & Women Owned Law Firms (NAMWOLF) . 43 The AMA continued efforts toward expanding its vendor base to a more diverse group. 44 The AMA added to its suite of Employee Resources Groups with the launch of the Immigrant 45 Xchange ERG. ERGs1 are voluntary, self -coordinating employee -driven groups which are based 46 1 Immigrant Xchange joins Access, BEAN (Black Employees, Advocates and Allies Network) , InspirASIAN, Pride, Unidos, Veterans Community Resource Group, and Women Inspired Now (WIN) . B of T Rep. 10 -A-23 -- page 3 of 11 on a constituency or shared interest, and provide community, support and networking 1 opportunities. 2 The AMA continued its partnership with Urban Alliance's Alumni Internship Program (AIP), 3 which matches graduates of the High School Internship Program with paid 6- week summer 4 internships at the AMA, to help them gain valuable professional experience and earn incom e to 5 support their future . 6 The AMA committed to improving workplace accessibility including installing auto -operators on 7 doors in Chicago and DC, and reduced size of conference room tables to improve accommodation 8 for mobility devices and other factors. 9 The JAMA Network Equity Action Team (JNEAT ) led work including an anonymous pulse 10 survey of staff and bi -monthly newsletters and learning sessions for staff. W ebinars attracting 11 over 3 25 employees includ ed a dialogue with Dilla Thomas on the history of m edicine in Chicago 12 through the lens of its marginalized g roups , a learning session with Open Books Chicago on 13 literacy levels within Chicago's marginalized communities, and an interactive practice session for 14 staff to learn about updates and practice applying inclusive language and reporting guidance in 15 medical publication . 16 17 Build Alliances and Share Power 18 19 Building strategic alliances and partnerships and sharing power with historically marginalized and 20 minoritized physicians and other stakeholders is essential to advancing health equity. This work centers 21 previously excluded voices , builds advocacy coalitions, and establishes the foundation for true 22 accountability. The following are some of the relevant accomplishments during 202 2: 23 24 The AMA continued to sponsor events that engaged historically marginalized audiences, 25 including National Association of Black Journalists ( NABJ ), National Association of Hispanic 26 Journalists the Association of LGBTQ Journalists ( NLGJA) . 27 The AMA completed a community impact plan for improving blood pressure control in 28 collaboration with West Side United (WSU) . In October, working with the City Club of Chicago, 29 AMA convened business and civic leaders to highlight the collaboration and the AMA's 30 additional $3 million social impact investment , bringing the AMA's multi- year total investment 31 to $5 million, with the intention of benefit ting Chicago's 500,000 West Side residents (33% 32 Black, 39% Hispanic or Latino, 21% w hite). This investment leverages AMA's new commitment 33 as an anchor mission partner with WSU \u2014adding to a group of collaborators committed to 34 addressing structural in equities, eliminating health disparities and improving economic vitality 35 and educational opportunities in Chicago's west side communities, which have been devastated 36 by decades of neglect and disinvestment. 37 The national Release the Pressure (RTP) campaign , led by the AMA in collaboration with the 38 American Heart Association, the AMA Foundation, the Association of Black Cardiologists, the 39 Minority Health Institute , and the National Medical Assoc iation , was designed to increase 40 awareness of heart health, hear t disease and high blood pressure among Black wome n. The 41 campaign continued momentum in 2022 with over 67,000 video views and almost 31,000 42 pledges. 43 The Medical Justice in Advocacy Fellowship, a n educational initiative in collaboration with 44 Morehouse School of Medicine's Satcher Health Leadership Institute (SHLI) , showcased 45 capstone projects of the first cohort of 12 physician fellows at the AMA HOD Interim Meeting 46 and launched the second cohort of 11 physician fellows with intensive training at Morehouse 47 School of Medicine . 48 As part of the Physician Data Collaborati ve (Collaborati ve), the AAMC, ACGME and AMA 49 continue to work together to establish best practices for data sharing and collection and reporting 50 B of T Rep. 10 -A-23 -- page 4 of 11 standards for sociodemographic data, including race and ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender 1 identity and more. These efforts enable meaningful, collaborative research to better understand 2 the dynamics of the physician workforce continuum. During 2022, the Collaborati ve agreed on 3 race and ethnicity data collection standards and the addition of a Middle Eastern and North 4 African category ( establishing a pilot on the addition of this category ), and continue d to refine a 5 collaborative research agenda. 6 The AMA participated in or led four meetings with Association of American Medical Colleges 7 (AAMC ) and Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education ( ACGME ) about 8 diversifying physician workforce , three ACGME Diversity Officers Forum s, two webinars 9 (Enhancing Diversity Among Academic Physicians: Recruitment, Retention and Advancement ; 10 Removing barriers and facilitating access: Supporting trainees with disabil ities across the medical 11 education continuum) , two presentations to Academic Physicians Section (equity, diversity, and 12 belonging activities in medical education; m inoritized physician burnout and wellbeing ), and 13 three presentations on the implications of the pending Supreme Court decision on Students for 14 Fair Admissions v. Harvard / University of North Carolina. 15 The AMA provided seven speaking engagements or workshops with organizat ions that serve 16 historically margina lized communities (including one with AllianceChicago and three with 17 Arizona Alliance, both consortia of Federally Qualified Health Centers, or FQHCs ), completed 18 burnout assessments in 32 FQHCs (representing approximately 31% of all burnout assessments 19 during the year ), updated demographic questions in burnout assessments , and built a racial bias 20 assessment tool (to be validated in 2023) . The AMA piloted the stratification of all burnout 21 assessment data for each health system report for a 3 -month period to better understand how it 22 informs systems as well as the limitations of the data. 23 The AMA engaged with Illinois March of Dimes in workgroups on dismantling racism, 24 increasing care access, and engaging communities in private practices to support maternity care 25 deserts. 26 The health equity content on AMA's Ed Hub has established itself as an impetus for institutional 27 memberships and partnerships , with six additional health equity- focused external partners signed 28 and launched duri ng the year (Clinical Problem Solvers, Boston Children' s Hospital, American 29 Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, American Academy of Dermatology, Hope for 30 Justice, and Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education or ACGME) . The UNC 31 Health Syste ms recently selected the Ed Hub's \"Basics of Health Equity\" as required education 32 for their entire medical staff. During t he Mpox outbreak , the established relationships with 33 LGBTQ health organizations allow ed for swift response with accurate, effective, and 34 destigmatizing education reaching the large Ed Hub audience. 35 The AMA ChangeMedEd initiative implemented grants awarded in November to various 36 recipients, including Kaiser Permanente (Early Assurance: Community College to Medical 37 School ) and UC Davis ( Learning from Bright Spots in Equitable Grading Practices ). 38 The AMA continued its work with organizations representing historically mino ritized and 39 marginalized physicians, including Association of American Indian Physicians (AAIP), GLMA, 40 National Council of Asian Pacific Islander Physicians (NCAPIP), National Hispanic Medical 41 Association (NHMA), and National Medical Association (NMA). The AMA concluded a second 42 year of Health Equity Strategic Development (HESD) grants, an investment in these 43 organizations in support of the advancement of their individual organizational mission and 44 strategic goals, and in recognition of the collective impac t of their work on the field of medicine. 45 In addition, the Center convened the organizations quarterly, building a crosswalk of shared 46 policy priorities to identify opportunities to build on each other's advocacy in future years. The 47 LGBTQ Advisory Committ ee has a permanent position for a representative from GLMA on the 48 committee, which allowed for continued regular coordination and collaboration with GLMA. The 49 B of T Rep. 10 -A-23 -- page 5 of 11 Minority Affairs Section has permanent positions on its Governing Council for representatives 1 from AAIP, NHMA, and NMA. 2 The Medical Student Section (MSS) Assembly includes delegates from the Association of Native 3 American Medical Students (ANAMS), the Latino Medical Student Association (LMSA), and the 4 Student National Medical Association (SNMA). MSS continued collaborating with the Minority 5 Affairs Section (MAS) to enhance engagement of medical students who are underrepresented in 6 medicine (URM), sending select members of both Governing Councils as ambassadors to the 7 annual conferences of URM medical student societies including SNMA, LMSA and ANAMS. 8 This year, MAS launched its Leader -To-Leader initiative to better align the section's priorities 9 around increasing diversity, equity, inclusion, and representation in the physician workforce. 10 MAS and MSS members worked together to host receptions at the SNMA and LMSA annual 11 conferences where our URM AMA leaders could meet with their elected and appointed leaders to 12 open new lines of communication, to establish informal networks, and to learn more about 13 organizational priorities. In April, MAS supported registration and housing for approximately 10 14 elected leaders of MSS, SNMA, LMSA and ANAMS to attend the annual Leadership Summit on 15 Health Disparities, to foster network expansion, informal networking, and educational 16 opportunities among these future doctors. The MAS and MSS Governing Councils also hosted a 17 meeting in November to specifically convene URM medical student leaders who attended our 18 Interim Meeting in Honolulu. 19 The AMA formalized its col laboration with Stanford supporting research using AMA data to 20 explore the effects of the COVID pandemic on international medical graduate (IMG) physicians, 21 patterns of care provided by IMGs across the U.S., and their role in providing patient care for 22 underserved communities during COVID-19. 23 Push Upstream 24 25 Pushing upst ream requires looking beyond cultural, behavioral, or genetic reasons to understand structural 26 and social drivers of health and inequities, dismantle systems of oppression , and build health equity into 27 health care and broader society. The following are some of the relevant accomplishments during 2022: 28 29 On the international stage, the World Medical Association (WMA) General Assembly adopt ed a 30 new policy to address racism in medicine, to which the AMA contributed substantial language 31 and support, based largely on HOD policy. T he AMA has also been leading the ongoing revision 32 of a seminal WMA document, the Declaration of Helsinki Ethical Principles for Medical 33 Research Involving Human Subjects, prioritiz ing diverse perspectives and issues of equity, such 34 as ethical research in vulnerable populations . Finally, the AMA has continued centering equity in 35 other WMA policy revisions, including addressing the disproportionate impact of forced 36 sterilization on certain groups. 37 The AMA was a powerful voice on reproductive health following the Supreme Court's Dobbs 38 decision in June and continue d to be visible on this topic in the media and speeches and published 39 numerous AMA Viewpoints on topics important to health equity including LGBTQ health, pulse 40 oximeters, and Black maternal health. 41 In cases ranging from COVID -19 standards of care and firea rm regulations to climate change and 42 transgender rights, the AMA continued to fight for physicians and patients in state and federal 43 courts. The AMA was a plaintiff in African American Tobacco Control Leadership Council v. 44 HHS , which forced the federal government to take the first steps toward banning menthol 45 cigarettes. In support of the consideration of race in higher education admissions, the AMA 46 joined an AAMC-led U.S. Supreme Court amicus brief in the Students for Fair Admission v. 47 Harvard and Students for Fair Admission v. University of North Carolina cases. Together with 48 the American Academy of Pediatrics, the AMA submitted an amicus brief urging the U.S. 49 B of T Rep. 10 -A-23 -- page 6 of 11 Supreme Court to uphold the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) of 1978. And in the wake of the 1 U.S. Supreme Court's Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision, the AMA 2 joined numerous briefs promoting access to r eproductive care and opposing government 3 interference in the patient- physician relationship. 4 The AMA now looks at every advocacy issue with an eye towards its impact on historically 5 marginalized and minoritized communities. The AMA issued more than 175 adv ocacy letters to 6 policymakers, and more than 40 percent of those were directly related to our health equity work. 7 AMA advocated in many ways for policies to advance health equity including: 8 o Securing legislation extending telehealth payment and regulatory flexibilities through the 9 end of 2024, including audio-only telephone visit services. T he AMA also launched 10 model legislation that states can use to advance telehealth coverage and policies. 11 o Supporting maternal and child health. The AMA d eveloped new model state legislation 12 to support maternal and child health in partnership with leading medical societies and 13 national organizations. The model bill is part of a national campaign to support pregnant, 14 postpartum and parenting individuals, newborns, children and families affected by 15 substance use disorders. The AMA supported 27 states and DC in extending Medicaid 16 coverage to 12 months postpartum and secured a permanent option to support states in 17 the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 (CAA). 18 o Securing key provisions of the Mainstreaming Addiction Treatment (MAT) Act (such as 19 repealing the X -waiver requirement for buprenorphine prescribing) in the CAA, revisions 20 to CDC guidelines for prescribing opioids that emphasize the need to treat p atients as 21 individuals, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) policy allowing harm reduction 22 organizations to more easily obtain naloxone to prevent overdose deaths, and a Drug 23 Enforcement Administration (DEA) commitment to working for permanent availability 24 of medication assisted treatment based on telehealth visits. The AMA also helped 25 multiple states enact legislation to decriminalize fentanyl test strips and other drug testing 26 supplies and equipment, acknowledging the annual more than 100,000 deaths are 27 primarily due to illicitly manufactured fentanyl and fentanyl analogues. 28 o The AMA Substance Use and Pain Care Task Force continued to advocate to reduce 29 health care inequities, including those that disproportionately affect historically 30 minoritized and marginalized communities. Reports from the Task Force and those 31 conducted with Manatt Health make clear that reversing the nation's overdose and death 32 epidemic must directly address structural barriers and social determinants of health. The 33 Task Force cont inues to gather input from member organizations Association of 34 American Indian Physicians, National Hispanic Medical Association and National 35 Medical Association. 36 o Supporting m ultiple state efforts to enact legislation to strengthen mental health and 37 substance use disorder parity laws. These include requiring payers to demonstrate 38 compliance with parity laws and for state departments of insurance and attorneys general 39 to investigate payers' compliance. 40 o The AMA and several collaborators sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland 41 urging the Department of Justice to investigate the threats of violence against physicians, 42 hospitals and fami lies of children for providing and seeking evidence-ba sed gender- 43 affirming care . The organizations also call on technology platforms to do more to stop the 44 rhetoric that often incites threats or acts of violence and has led to harassment campaigns 45 across the country, much of it directed at children's hospitals and the physicians and s taff 46 who provide care . 47 o Highlighting inequities in Medicare Advantage including quality and administrative 48 barriers. In a letter to the United States Department of Health and Human Servic es 49 (HHS ), the AMA noted that Black, Asian, and Latino enrollees sign up for Medicare 50 Advantage (MA) at higher rates than white enrollees but tend to be in plans with lower 51 B of T Rep. 10 -A-23 -- page 7 of 11 quality ratings. Kaiser Family Foundation data show that nearly all (99 percent) of MA 1 enrollees are in plans that require prior authorization ( PA) for some services, up from 80 2 percent in 2018. Institute for Patient Access data show that patients with chronic 3 conditions who identify as Black or Latino experience insurance claim rejections at least 4 40% more often than white patients, going on to experience more emergency room visits 5 and hospitalizations. The AMA helped move a bipartisan House bill to reform prior 6 authorization for Medicare Advantage plans, H.R. 3173, the \"Improving Seniors ' Access 7 to Care Act ,\" passed via voice vote, and a companion Senate bill now with 51 co- 8 sponsors. 9 o Developing principles for Medicare physician payment reform endorsed by more than 10 120 medical societies, which incorporate concepts to advance equity and reduc e 11 disparities. 12 o Cosigning a letter in conjunction with over 60 national medical specialty, hospita l and 13 patient organizations urging the House and Senate Judiciary Committees to pass the 14 \"Conrad State 30 and Physician Access Reauthorization Act,\" which would reauthorize 15 the Conrad 30 waiver policy for an additional three years , to ensure international medical 16 graduates (IMGs) can continue to play a pivotal role in greater access to health care . 17 o Submitting a Statement for the Record to the U.S. House of Representatives Committee 18 on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship as part of the hearing 19 entitled \"Is there a Doctor in the House? The Role of Immigrant Physicians in the US 20 Healthcare System.\" Additionally, the AMA submitted a Statement for the Record to the 21 U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, and Border Safety as part of the 22 hearing entitled, \"Flatlining Care: Why Immigrants Are Crucial to Bolstering Our Health 23 Care Workforce.\" 24 o The AMA continues to support laws tha t prohibit so -called conversion therapy. We 25 successfully supported the Oklahoma State Medical Association in opposing a bill that 26 would have protected conversion therapy and worked with the AMA's Advisory 27 Committee on LGBTQ+ issues to update and disseminat e an issue brief summarizing the 28 medical literature demonstrating the harm caused by conversion therapy. 29 o Supporting a Dear Colleague letter to the FDA Commissioner urging the end of the 30 blanket three -month blood donation deferral period for men who have sex with men. The 31 Dear Colleague letter was ultimately cosigned by nearly 150 members of Congress. The 32 FDA has signaled that it will continue existing flexibilities. 33 Every bi- weekly issue of the AMA's Advocacy Update includes at least one article related to our 34 health equity work. Equity- related episodes of the AMA's Advocacy Insights webinar series, 35 such as the limited time Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program waiver, the future of 36 telemedicine, and the impact of the nation's drug overdose epid emic on children and adolescents, 37 have had significant participation (hundreds of attendees) and engagement (30+ questions) each 38 session. 39 The AMA launched a bi -monthly health equity newsletter and the Federation Equity Exchange, 40 attracting dozens of attendees each month for state and specialty societies to share promising 41 practices. 42 This is the first year covered by the AMA's annual Health Equity in Organized Medicine Survey. 43 The survey seeks to understand the specific actions that Federation organizations are taking or 44 contemplated taking to advance health equity, gather shareable successes stories, and 45 confidentially identify barriers and resource needs. 46 o Eighty organizations completed the survey: half (n=40) were specialty societies, about 1 47 in 3 (n=25) were state and District of Columbia associations, and about 1 in 5 (n=15) 48 were local associations. 49 o Most organizations (70%) indicated that health equity was a strategic priority. 50 B of T Rep. 10 -A-23 -- page 8 of 11 o Most organizations were aware of the AMA's Organizational Strategic Plan to Embed 1 Racial Justice and Advance Health Equity (85%), and the AMA and AAMC's Advancing 2 Health Equity: A Guide to Language, Narrative and Concepts (54%). Among the 3 organizations that were aware, about half referenced or used the materials. More than half 4 (n=44) indicated they provided equity training to staff and leadership. 5 o More than 1 in 3 (n=30) organizations indicated they had identified historical harms in 6 their organization's policies and practices, and 30% of organizations indicated that they 7 have taken action to address past harms caused by their organization. 8 o Note: All results are preliminary . The survey results are still being analyzed, with a full 9 summary planned for later in 2023. 10 The JAMA Network published over 632 articles on topics related to equity, diversity, and 11 inclusion, viewed in full text 4 million times. 12 AMA staff contributed to at least 10 publications in related to health equity. 13 The AMA's Ed Hub published an unprecedented volume of heath equity content (78 activities ), 14 with usage of equity- related content exceed ing the prior year ( 124,374 engagements ; 21,625 15 course completions ). One highlight included: undergraduate / graduate (U ME/GME) and 16 continuing medical education (CME) versions of the Historical Foundations of Racism modules 17 were published , as well as adapted version s accessible for UME and GME curricular 18 enhancement program ( UCEP /GCEP ) members and individual learners : Medical Mistr ust and 19 Medical Distrust ; Pain and Racism in Medicine and Health Care . In addition, the AMA led 4 20 presentations at health care meetings demonstrating education al best practices for integration of 21 equity. 22 The AMA concluded its year -long Peer Network learning collaborative , led by AMA with The 23 Joint Commission (TJC) and Brigham and Women's H ospital as key collaborators , positively 24 influencing the development of TJC equity accreditation standards for health systems . 25 o The pilot program of 49 learning sessions included more than 40 participants from eight 26 health systems, of which 3 were AMA group members , graduat ing the health systems 27 into a Quality Safety and Equity Network integrated into the Physician Innovation 28 Network . 29 o Successes of over 26 new improvement practices implemented by the health system 30 team s included embedding a bias/discrimination question into safety reporting to track 31 and take action on equity- related harm events, incorporating fundamental data collection 32 tools to stra tify data sets by race, ethnicity, and language (REAL), improving on 33 disability, sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data collection, developing 34 educational content to better equip staff on how to identify inequities, bringing together 35 multidisciplinary stakeholders across the system to identify improvements that will result 36 in better patient and staff experience and outcomes, and incorporating health equity into 37 the development and implementation of a racial equity plan. 38 o At mid -year, survey respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the quality of the Peer 39 Network was excellent (100%) and that it equipped them to advance health equity, 40 strengthened their knowledge of inequities, and empowered them to dismantle structural 41 racism (>80%). 42 o Products included creating seven Ed Hub modules with CME and a Prioritizing Equity 43 episode highlighting the work of two group member health systems, Atlantic Medical 44 Group and Ochsner Health. 45 o The Peer Network was covered in 37 articles with over 10 million views. 46 The AMA laid the groundwork for Rise to Health: A National Coalition for Equity in Health 47 Care, an effort that unites individuals and organizations in shared solutions for high- impact 48 structural change. The Coalition, co -led by the AMA and the Institute fo r Healthcare 49 Improvement ( IHI), secured other collaborators includ ing Race Forward, Groundwater Institute, 50 B of T Rep. 10 -A-23 -- page 9 of 11 the American Hospital Association (AHA), the National Association of Community Health 1 Centers (NACHC), Association of Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), the Council of Medical 2 Specialty Societies (CMSS), Policy Link, and HealthBegins , with a general audience launch 3 planned for 2023. 4 The AMA expanded its social impact investments with an additional $3 million multi -year 5 investment in West Side United (WSU) , a community -based collaborative that is addressing 6 determinants of health and helping restore economic vitality on the Chicago's west side. 7 o This new investment builds on the AMA's initial $2 million investment in 2020 and will 8 continue to support WSU's multi -pronged social impact investing approach. WSU - 9 coordinated impact investing is done in partnership with community development 10 financial institutions (CDFIs) to help provide much- needed capital to foster economic 11 opportunity, revitalize neighborhoods and support community transformation. AMA's 12 renewed commitments will lead to more investments in affordable housing, healthy food 13 options, job creation projects and educational programs. 14 o To date, WSU partners have invested a combi ned $177 million in Chicago's West Side 15 neighborhoods through local procurement, small business grants, and impact investing, 16 including the AMA's 5- year, $5 million investment. Since 2018, the collaborative's 17 funding has contributed to approximately 475 low -interest loans, including entrepreneurs, 18 small businesses, and community- based organizations. CDFIs leveraged these 19 investments for an additional $28 million to support the west side community and 20 business projects. The WSU investments also resulted in t he creation and preservation of 21 420 housing units, as well as the construction and preservation of more than 34,000 22 square feet of non -profit and commercial real estate projects. Additionally, these 23 investments have supported 432 construction jobs, preserved 64 local jobs, and created 24 126 community employment opportunities. 25 In collaboration with West Side United and West Side Health Equity Collaborative, the AMA, 26 trained more than 100 community health workers . In addition, the AMA MAP BP program was 27 imple mented and demonstrated success in improving blood pressure control at Cook County 28 Health , a large health care organization serving mostly patients from historically margin alized 29 communities . 30 31 Ensure Equity in Innovation 32 33 The AMA is committed to ensuring equitable health innovation by embedding equity in innovation, 34 centering historically marginalized and minoritized people and communities in development and 35 investment , and collaborating across sectors. The following are some of the relevant accomplishments 36 during 2022 : 37 38 The AMA launched the In Full Health Learning & Action Community to Advance Equitable 39 Health Innovation initiative which seeks to provide a framework for shared understanding and a 40 commun ity for stakeholders committed to learning and action to center equity within their health 41 innovation investment, development, and purchasing efforts by committing resources to 42 innovations created by, with, and that measurably improve health and do no harm for Black, 43 Latino , Indigenous, communities of color, women, LGBTQ+ communities, people with 44 disabilities, people with low income, rural communities, and other communities historically 45 marginalized by the health industry. The initiative established an exte rnal advisory group and 46 published Principles for Equitable Health Innovation. 47 The AMA completed a health equity assessment on Verifi Health Self -Measured Blood Pressure 48 (SMBP ), an app for remote blood pressure monitoring, and continues to build features into the 49 product that promote health equity. 50 B of T Rep. 10 -A-23 -- page 10 of 11 The AMA created a prototype Social Needs Administrative Coder (SNAC) and began a Voice- of- 1 the-Customer campaign across societies, technology vendors, state level entities, health insurers, 2 community organizations and health information exchange s to better understand the need for 3 consistent coding of health -related social needs (HRSN) screening data into nationally accepted 4 codesets like ICD -10-CM. 5 6 Foster Truth, Racial Healing, Reconciliation , and Transformation 7 8 The AMA recognizes the importance of acknowledging and rectifying past injustices in advancing health 9 equity for the health and well -being of both physicians and patients. Truth, racial healing, reconciliation, 10 and transformation is a process and an outcome , documenting past harms, amplifying and integrating 11 narratives previously made invisible , and creating collaborative spaces , pathways , and plans. The 12 following are some of the relevant accomplishments during 20 22: 13 14 The 175th anniversary workgroup included AMA archivists as key stakeholders, supporting truth 15 and reconciliation, through development of historical research for programming and educational 16 modules and networking with other medical association professionals looking to examine their 17 histories in this way. 18 The AMA began creat ing a charter and identifying potential participants for the Truth, 19 Reconciliation, Healing, and Transformation A dvisory C ommittee called for by the AMA House 20 of Delegates, so the committee can commence work in 2023. 21 AMA staff engaged in educational sessions and community events including : AMA 22 History/Transformative Narrative, Guide to Allyship, Time for P ersonal R eflection, Liberation 23 Health: Allyship, My Hood / My Block, My City Event, Color of Care Screening and Breakouts , 24 ERG Review & Recruitment, Gardeneers Event, Women Inspi red Now ( WIN ) Reproductive 25 Rights Session and D iscussion . One session was a deeper look at the history of work toward 26 reproductive justice within the AMA, findings from qualitative research with patients who have 27 received obstetric, gynecological, and rela ted care, and policy- related implications for maternal 28 health given recent federal level court and legislative actions, state politics, transitional care, 29 contraceptive access for patients, providers, and public health. A Reproductive Justice panel 30 feature d obstetrics and gynecology experts as guests, and opening remarks provided by former 31 AMA President Patrice Harris , MD, MPH . 32 Dilla Thomas was invited to speak to staff on the Black History of Medicine in Chicago. He titled 33 the event, \"Everything Dope Comes from Chicago: A Look into the History of Chicago in 34 Medicine Through the Lens of its Marginalized Groups.\" 35 36 Challenges and Opportunities 37 38 As cities and states across the nation updated social distancing guidance, staff returned to AMA offices 39 and began adjust ing to new hybrid schedules which required an additional layer of planning and 40 coordination. This required strategizing innovative ways to build connections and foster engagement in a 41 new work environment. 42 43 Commonly noted challenges to advancing health equity work include d: 1) limited staff time and capacity , 44 resource constraints , and competing priorities with tight deadlines ; 2) varying levels of understanding of 45 health equity, with persistence of some common narratives that sustain inequity ; 3) still fledgling 46 structures and processes for cross -enterprise dialogue , coordination, and reporting on initiatives and 47 measures; and 4) the capacity, infra structure, and time needed to develop external collaborations . While 48 turnover was mentioned as a challenge to sustaining the health equity work, in some cases the scarcity of 49 open positions posed challenges to increasing diversi ty in promotion. 50 B of T Rep. 10 -A-23 -- page 11 of 11 1 Prioritizing and matching workload to capacity were mentioned as essential in avoiding contributing to 2 burnout. Additional curriculum and sessions that foster conversations and self -reflection to further 3 understanding and undoing harms in a psychologically safe space require substantial time , timeliness, 4 skilled facilitators , and openness and commitment from team leaders . Additional structures and processes 5 that support transparent shar ing of goals, planning, resources, implementation, and accountability across 6 teams and with external collaborators can help bring focus to priorities and promote sustainability. 7 8 CONCLUSION 9 10 AMA staff were asked for their most prominent equity -related accomplish ments , and not everything 11 submitted could be included in this report, so the above represents a fraction of the work completed in 12 2022. The AMA increased engagement of health equity content to 1,000,000 website users , including 13 124,374 engagements driven by publication of 78 new activities on Ed Hub. The AMA engaged in at least 14 two Supreme Court amicus briefs and issued more than 70 advocacy letters to policymakers related to 15 health equity, securing wins in the Consolidated Appropriations Act. The AMA expanded its social 16 impact investments with an addi tional $3 million multi -year investment. Overall, the AMA has made 17 significant progress towards fulfilling the commitments outlined in the Plan during its second year . 18 \u00a9 2023 American Medical Association. All rights r eserved . REPORT OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES B of T Report 16 -A-23 Subject: Informal Inter -Member Mentoring Presented by: Sandra Adamson Fryhofer, MD, Chair At the November 2021 Special Meeting of the House of Delegates (HOD), Policy D -635.980, 1 \"Informal Inter -Member Mentoring,\" was adopted. As reported at the 2022 Interim Meeting (Board 2 Report 6), last year our AMA convened on an ad hoc basis a Mentorship Steering Committee 3 consi sting of representatives from each of the AMA sections. This group was charged with 4 identifying mentorship opportunities and best practices within individual sections and more broadly 5 across the organization. The Committee's key conclusion was that the AMA should create 6 informal, organic opportunities for mentors and mentees to identify one another and connect, as 7 opposed to establishing more formal programs with assigned mentors/mentees. 8 9 The Committee's discussions prompted a variety of mentorship initiat ives of this connective nature 10 within the sections in 2022, including for example: 11 12 The Women Physicians Section implemented a \"speed mentorship\" event that connected 13 members in small group discussions with facilitators versed in career -building topics. 14 15 The Young Physicians Section hosted a \"leadership boot camp\" for young physician 16 members interested in pursuing leadership opportunities beyond the YPS and throughout 17 the AMA. 18 19 The Minority Affairs Section hosted a webinar and networking reception to engage and 20 build connections among current and future MAS and AMA leaders from minoritized and 21 marginalized backgrounds . 22 23 While many individual sections have instituted informal mentorship opportunities designed 24 primarily to connect members , with others in the w orks, cross- section al and broader organizational 25 mentorship initiatives have remain ed elusive , largely due to issues of scalability . In 2023, a 26 reconstituted Mentorship Steering Committee representative of the broad swath of AMA member 27 backgrounds and expe riences will be reconvened to continue consideration of opportunities to 28 connect members for mentorship purposes outside the confines of any particular section . Your 29 Board will continue to provide updates via HOD implementation status documents as this work 30 proceeds. 31 \u00a9 2023 American Medical Association. All rights r eserved . REPORT OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES B of T Report 19 -A-23 Subject: Medical Community Voting in Federal and State Elections (Resolution 616 -A-22) Presented by: Sandra Adamson Fryhofer, MD, Chair Resolution 616 \"Medical Student, Resident/Fellow, and Physician Voting in Federal, State and 1 Local Elections ,\" was adopted at the AMA House of Delegates' 2022 Annual Meeting. Per the first 2 resolve of Resolution 616, now AMA Policy D -65.982: 3 4 Our AMA will : (1) study the rate of voter turno ut in physicians, residents, fellows and medical 5 students in federal and state elections without regard to political party affiliation or voting 6 record, as a step towards understanding political participation in the medical community. 7 8 This report complete s the request for such a study. 9 10 EXISTING RESEARCH ON PHYSICIAN VOTING TRENDS AND BEHAVIOR 11 12 The consensus conclusion o f public ly available studies and analysis addressing physician voting is 13 that physicians consistently vote at lower rates than the general public. Three such reports that help 14 uphold this conclusion are \"Trends in Physician Voting Practices in California, New York, and 15 Texas, 2006- 2018\"1 by Hussain Lalani, MD, MPH, et al., published in JAMA Internal Medicine 16 2021; \"Voting Behavior of Physicians and Healthcare Professionals\"2 by Rachel Solnick, MD, 17 MSc, et al., published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine 2020 ; and \"Do Doctors Vote?\"3 18 by David Grande, MD, MPA, et al., published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine 2007. 19 Through modeling analysis incorporating a variety of publicly available and commercially acquired 20 data, the authors of these studies found physicians voting anywhere from 9 to more than 12 percent 21 less than the general public going back to 2002. 22 23 Lalani et al. looked at the states with the highest physician populations in their study . Their finding 24 that physicians who were eligible to vote did so at rates at least 9 percent less than the general 25 population takes into account data as recent as 2018 . The authors offer their proposed reasons as to 26 why physician turnout was lower, including fear of appearing \"political\" as well as other 27 \"administrative and psychological barriers.\" However, it should be noted that Lalani et al. 28 acknowledge that th is reasoning is speculative and that the true source(s) of limited physician 29 engagement in voting is \"unclear\" as well as the possible link between physicians who register to 30 vote and those who actually turn out to vote. 31 32 In their study, Solnick et al. looked at physicians as well as other health care professionals 33 including dentists, nurses, physician assistants and pharmacists and found that they also 34 consistently voted at rates lower than the general publi c, although except for dentists somewhat 35 higher than physicians . The researchers based their findings on a biennial nationally representative 36 household survey that collects self -reported or household member -reported voting rates and 37 behavior from congressi onal and presidential elections. They estimated physicians voting at 38 approximately 12 percent below that of the public . The authors further found that 70 percent of 39 B of T Rep. 19 -A-23 -- page 2 of 2 physicians who were either not registered to vote or did not vote reported that this was due to being 1 \"Too busy, conflicting work or school.\" Physicians were 30 percent more likely to vote by mail 2 and 15 percent more likely to vote prior to election day compared to the public. Solnick et al. also 3 examined non- health care related professions as part of this study ; specifically , those requiring 4 advanced education and/or training including, postsecondary teachers, chief executives, civil 5 engineers, social workers and lawyers. Solnick et al. found that of these , postsecondary teacher 6 turnout was highest ; 14 percent above the general population. The authors suggest that further 7 research examine whether heal th care professionals voting rates can be improved by Election Day 8 flexible scheduling, health care organizat ion campaigns to emphasize the social value of voting, 9 voter registration drives, and education on mail -in voting. 10 11 Finally, Grande et al. compared adjusted physician voting rates in 1996- 2002 congressional and 12 presidential elections with those of lawyers and the general population. Like the others, they found 13 physicians voting at lower rates when compared to the public (8.7 percent lower on average ) for 14 each of these elections except in 1996 . Lawyers meanwhile had voting rates that were 13 .5 percent 15 highe r than the public during this same time span . Additionally, Grande et al. noted that these 16 trend s occurred even in the face of a renewed commitment at that time to prioritize civic 17 participation and engagement within the medical profession led by multiple medical organizations 18 including the American Medical Association that in 2001 issued its \"Declaration of Professional 19 Responsibility Medicine's Social Contract with Humanity ,\" which included a commitment to 20 \"advocate for...political changes that ameliorate suffering and contribute to human well- being.\"4 21 22 CONCLUSION 23 24 Apart from the studies referenced in this report, there would seem to be a paucity of in -depth, 25 credible analysis on the issue of physician voter turnout. For the studies examin ed as part of this 26 report however, it is notable that in each, to the extent that the authors explored possible reasons for 27 why physicians overall voted at lower rates than the general public , their conclusions were 28 speculative. It seems reasonable to conclude that physicians as a group do indeed tend to vote at 29 rates both lower than the general public and lower than that of selected professions requiring 30 advance d education and training. With so little data available and to better inform on the issue , the 31 AMA may consider including questions related to the subject of physician voting habits in future 32 polling projects if appropriate . 33 1 Hussain Lalani, et al. \"Trends in Physician Voting Practices in California, New York, and Texas, 2006- 2018,\" JAMA Internal Medicine 181, 3 (2021): internmed.2020.6887 2 Rachel Solnick, et al. \"Voting Behavior of Physicians and Healthcare Professionals,\" Journal of General Internal Medicine 36, 1 (2021): 1169- 1171. 10.1007/s11606 -020-06461- 2 3 David Grande, et al. \"Do Doctors Vote?\" Journal of General Internal Medicine 22, 5 (2007): 585- 589. 10.1007/s11606- 007-0105- 8 4 American Medical Association, Declaration of Professional Responsibility: Medicine's Social Contract with Humanity (2001).

By being prudent stewards and delivering care efficiently, teams also have the 10 potential to expand access to care for populations of patients. Such teams are defined by their 11 dedication to providing patient -centered care, protecting the integrity of the patient -physician 12 relationship, sharing mutual respect and trust, communicating effectively, sharing 13 accountability and responsibility, and upholding common ethical values as team members. 14 15 Health care teams often include members of multiple health professions, including physicians, 16 nurse practitioners, physician assistants , pharmacist s, physical therapists, and care managers 17 among others. To foster the trust essential to healing relationships between patients and 18 physicians or nonphysician practiti oners , all members of the team should be candid about their 19 professional credentials, their experience, and the role they will play in the patient's care. 20 An effective team requires the vision and direction of an effective leader. In medicine, this 21 means having a clinical leader who will ensure that the team as a whole functions effectively 22 and facilitates decision -making. Physicians are uniquely situated to serve as clinical leaders. By 23 virtue of their thorough and diverse training, experience, and knowle dge, physicians have a 24 distinctive appreciation of the breadth of health issues and treatments that enables them to 25 synthesize the diverse professional perspectives and recommendations of the team into an 26 appropriate, coherent plan of care for the patient. 27 28 As clinical leaders within health care teams, physicians individually should: 29 30 (a) Model ethical leadership by: 31 (i) Understanding the range of their own and other team members' skills and expertise and 32 roles in the patient's care 33 * Opinions of the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs will be placed on the Consent Calendar for informational reports, but may be withdrawn from the Consent Calendar on motion of any member of the House of Delegates and referred to a Reference Committee.

Because of their commitment to 11 care for the sick and injured, individual physicians have an obligation to provide urgent 12 medical care during disasters. This obligation hold s even in the face of greater than usual risks 13 to physicians' own safety, health, or life. 14 15 The duty to treat is foundational to the profession of medicine but is not absolute. The health 16 care work force is not an unlimited resource and must be preserved to ensure that care is 17 available in the future. For their part, physicians have a responsibil ity to protect themselves, as 18 well as a duty of solidarity to colleagues to share risks and burdens in a public health crisis. So 19 too, health care institutions have responsibilities to support and protect health care 20 professionals and to apportion the risks and benefits of providing care as equitably as possible. 21 22 Many physicians owe competing duties of care as medical professionals and as individuals 23 outside their professional roles. In a public health crisis, institutions should provide support to 24 enable physicians to meet compelling personal obligations without undermining the 25 fundamental obligation to patient welfare. In exceptional circumstances, when arrangements to 26 allow the physician to honor both obligations are not feasible, it may be ethically acceptable for 27 a physician to limit participating in care, prov ided that the institution has made available 28 another mechanism for meeting patients ' needs. Institutions should strive to be flexible in 29 supporting physicians in efforts to address such conflicts. The more immediately relevant a 30 physician's clinical expert ise is to the urgent needs of the moment and the less that alternative 31 care mechanisms are available, the stronger the professional obligation to provide care despite 32 competing obligations. 33 * Opinions of the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs will be placed on the Consent Calendar for informational reports, but may be withdrawn from the Consent Calendar on motion of any member of the House of Delegates and referred to a Reference Committee.

Sc hwartz, Chair , \"Research Handling of De -Identified Patient Data,\" adopted in November 2021 1 directs the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs (CEJA) to \"consider re-examining existing 2 guidance relevant to the confidentiality of patient information, striving to preserve the benef its of 3 widespread use of de-identified patient data for purposes of promoting quality improvement, 4 research, and public health while mitigating the risks of re- identification of such data.\" 5 6 This informational report summarizes CEJA's research and deliber ations to date and direction of 7 further inquiry. 8 9 DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOUR PATIENTS' DATA ARE TONIGHT? 10 11 An extraordinary variety of data are now regularly collected by multiple entities and stakeholders, 12 for multiple \u2014and potentially discrepant\u2014purposes: 13 14 The last few decades have witnessed the creation of novel ways to produce, store, and 15 analyse data, culminating in the emergence of the field of data science, which brings 16 together computational, algorithmic, statistical and mathematical techniques towards 17 extrapolating knowledge from big data. . . . The availability of vast amounts of data in 18 machine- readable formats provides an incentive to create efficient procedures to collect, 19 organise, visualise and model these data. . . . Researchers across all discipli nes see the 20 newfound ability to link and cross -reference data from diverse sources as improving the 21 accuracy and predictive power of scientific findings and helping to identify future 22 directions of inquiry, thus ultimately providing a novel starting point for empirical 23 investigation [1]. 24 25 As one scholar has noted, in this new data landscape \"it is almost impossible to perform most daily 26 activities without revealing personal information and providing fodder for data brokers and big data 27 organizations, whether they are public or private \" [2]. Data that in themselves are not traditionally 28 categorized as \"medical\" or \"health related\" can still yield information about health status \u2014for 29 example, predictive analysis of data about customers' purchases enabled Target \"to identify about 30 25 products that, when analyzed together, allowed the company t o assign each shopper a 31 \"pregnancy prediction\" score, and even to predict the shopper's due date [3]. 32 33 The ease with which data from multiple sources within and outside medicine can now be linked 34 and cross- referenced significantly exacerbates challenges of protecting patient privacy and the 35 confidentiality of health information. The council has come to recognize that it should extend its 36 analysis beyond research use of patient information to questions of what role physicians and health 37 CEJA Rep. 06-A-23 -- page 2 of 5 care institutions can and should play in protecting patients' interests in how their information is 1 shared and used more broadly. 2 3 WHY PROTECT PRIVACY/CONFIDENTIALITY? 4 5 Within the Code, Opinion 3.1.1 , \"Privacy in Health Care,\" distinguishes four aspects of privacy: 6 7 personal space (physical privacy), personal data (informational privacy), personal choices 8 including cultural and religious affiliations (decisional privacy), and personal relationships 9 with family members and other intimates (associational privacy). 10 11 The Code does not explicitly examine whether personal medical or health information are ethically 12 distinct from other kinds of personal information (e.g., financial records) or in what way. Current 13 guidance treats the importance of protecting privacy in all its forms as self -evident, holding that 14 respecting privacy in all its aspects is of fundamental importance, \"an expression of respect for 15 autonomy and a prerequisite for trust\" (Opinion 3.1.1 ). 16 17 In the context of information technology, van den Hoven identifies the following concerns with 18 respect to protecting personal data (medical or other): 19 20 Prevention of harm 21 Commodification of and asymmetry in power to control personal information 22 Informational injustice and discrimination 23 Encroachment on moral autonomy and human dignity [4] 24 25 Price and Cohen observe that violations of privacy can result in both harm\u2014 tangible n egative 26 consequences, such as discrimination in insurance or employment or identity theft \u2014and in wrongs 27 that occur from the fact of personal information being known without the subject's awareness, even 28 if the subject suffers no tangible harm: 29 30 One may be wronged by a privacy breach even if one has not been harmed. For example, 31 suppose that an organization unscrupulously or inadvertently gains access to data you store 32 on your smart phone as part of a larger data dragnet. After reviewing it, including photos 33 you have taken of an embarrassing personal ailment, the organization realizes your data is 34 valueless to them and destroys the record. You never find out this happened. Those 35 reviewing your data live abroad and will never encounter you or anyone who knows you. It 36 is hard to say you have been harmed in a consequentialist sense, but many think the loss of 37 control over your data, the invasion, is itself ethically problematic even absent harm [5] . 38 39 They further note that privacy issues can arise not only when data are known, but when data 40 mining enables others to \"generate knowledge about individuals through the process of inference 41 rather than direct observation or access\" [5]. Recall the anecdote above about Target inferring 42 customers' current health status from data of their purchases over time. 43 44 STRATEGIES FOR PROTECTING PRIVACY/CONFIDENTIALITY 45 46 In the U.S., the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) imposes constraints 47 on the sharing of \"protected health information\" contained in the medical record\u2014including in the 48 context of relationships within the limited domain of \"covered entities\" defined in the Act, such as 49 physicians, hospitals, pharmacies, and th ird-party payers. HIPAA does not cover certain other 50 CEJA Rep. 06- A-23 -- page 3 of 5 health -relevant data, especially data generated voluntarily by patients themselves, for example, 1 through the use of health- related apps on devices such as Fitbit or Apple Watch , let alone 2 identifiable d ata individuals provide to municipal authorities, utilities, or retailers. Information that 3 began in the medical record can take on a new, independent life when linked with personal 4 information widely available through datasets generated outside of health care. 5 6 The current state of data science challenges the prevailing procedural model for protecting privacy: 7 informed consent and de -identification. Yet as Barocas and Nissenbaum have observed, many 8 continue to see these \"as the best and only workable solu tions for coping with privacy hazards. 9 They do not deny the practical challenges, but their solution is to try harder \u2014to develop more 10 sophisticated mathematical and statistical techniques and new ways of furnishing notice . . .\" [6]. 11 12 That is, solutions have tended to take the form of technical solutions to enable captured data to be 13 shared, such as the creation of synthetic datasets that replace some or all sensitive or identifying 14 data in an original dataset with a statistically representative sample that preserves statistical 15 properties and relationships among variables of interest [7,8] . Alternative responses have taken the 16 form of proposals for new models of informed consent, such as \"blanket consent\" (permission to 17 use without restriction), [9] \"broad consent\" (consent for an unspecified range of future research 18 subject to content or process restrictions) , [6,10,11] and \"dynamic consent\" (the use of 19 personalized, digital interface between participants and researchers that allows participants to 20 \"tailor and manage their own consent preferences\" over time) [12,13] . 21 22 The Problem of Re -Identification 23 24 Whether de -identifying datasets truly prevents individual data subjects from being re- identified is 25 increasingly called into question. Removing the 18 identif iers specified in HIPAA can no longer 26 ensure that the data subject cannot be re- identified by triangulation with identifying information 27 from other readily available datasets [14] . The development of ever more robust statistical 28 strategies for de- identifying data in turn prompts the development of yet more robust strategies to 29 enable re- identification [15,16] . 30 31 The creation of \"synthetic\" datasets seek s to offer a technical solution that will enable research 32 with large datasets while protecting privacy by replacing some or all sensitive or identifying data in 33 an original dataset with a statistically representative sample that preserves statistical relationships 34 among variables of int erest [17,18] . Inspired by models in manufacturing and engineering, medical 35 \"digital twins\" \u2014AI technologies that simulate organs or tissues in real time and in relation to an 36 identifiable patient \u2014are proffered as tools to enable highly personalized predict ive medicine for 37 the patient whose data have been \"twinned\" [19,20] . 38 39 AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH: PRIVACY AS CONTEXTUAL INTEGRITY 40 41 Barocas and Nissenbaum contend that \"even if [prevailing forms of consent and anonymization] 42 were achievable, they would be ineffective against the novel threats to privacy posed by big data. \" 43 [6] A more effective option, Nissenbaum has argued, would understand privacy protecti on as a 44 function of \"contextual integrity,\" i.e., that in a given social domain information flows conform to 45 the context -specific informational norms of that domain. Whether a transmission of information is 46 appropriate depends on \"the type of information i n question, about whom it is, by whom and to 47 whom it is transmitted, and conditions or constraints under which this transmission takes place\" 48 [21]. 49 CEJA Rep. 06- A-23 -- page 4 of 5 Nissenbaum goes on to note that novel information flows, such as those enabled by contemporary 1 data science, should be assessed in reference to how they affect the interests of key parties and 2 whether the distribution of associated benefits, risks, and costs among parties is fair in terms of 3 who enjoys the benefits and who endures the costs. Further, appropriat e information flows serve 4 \"not merely the interests of individual information subjects, but also contextual, social ends and 5 values \u2014for example, whether information flows with health care achieve the ends and purposes of 6 health care and sustain the values associated with health care. 7 8 An evaluative framework proposed by Nissenbaum and colleagues focuses on components of 9 dataset creation and use: 10 11 Creation of the dataset \u2014sourcing, assembling, cleaning, assigning labels [1] 12 Composition \u2014properties of the datas et (content, mappings among data elements expressed 13 in different modalities) and attributes of the dataset (e.g., demographic representativeness) 14 Distribution \u2014how the dataset is made available, terms of use, disclaimers 15 Purpose \u2014what the data set is for, it s intended uses, the purposes for which it is optimized 16 [22] 17 18 Nissenbaum and colleagues identify ethical values associated with these components, including 19 privacy, autonomy, and the moral legitimacy of the purpose a dataset is created to serve, as well as 20 issues of bias, equity, and accountability, among others. 21 22 This approach has much in common with AMA analysis of conditions for trustworthy augmented 23 intelligence in medicine [23] and offers a starting point for thinking about how CEJA might 24 approach reco mmendations for ethically responsible management of patient information for 25 purposes of both clinical care and biomedical research. 26 27 MOVING FORWARD 28 29 Against this backdrop the council looks forward to continuing its deliberations and to presenting its 30 analy sis and recommendations at a future meeting of the House of Delegates. 31 CEJA Rep. 06- A-23 -- page 5 of 5 REFERENCES 1.

Schwartz , MD, Chair At its 2022 Annual Meeting, the House of Delegates referred Resolution 025- A-22 (Resolution 1 025), \"Use of Social Media for Product Promotion and Compensation ,\" which asked that the 2 American Medical Association (AMA) \"study the ethical issues of medical students, residents, 3 fellows, and physicians endorsing non- health related products through social and mainstream 4 media for personal or financial gain.\" 5 6 Over the course of its deliberations, the Council on Ethical and J udicial Affairs (CEJA) has 7 identified several relevant issues . These i nclude the volatile and dynamic nature of social media 8 and the fact social media user s are able to present themselves as a pro duct, promoting themselves 9 and/or attempting to influence others . At issue as well are the distinctive notions of professionalism 10 attached to the profession of medicine and how they impact individuals and physician integrity ; 11 and ethical differences among different promotional activities , e.g., whether the products or 12 services sold or promoted health - or no n-health related and whether they are marketed to patients 13 or the general public . 14 15 The AMA Code of Ethics has existing relevant gu idance : Opinions 9.6.4 , \"Sale of Health -Related 16 Products ,\" and 9.6.5, \" Sale of Non- Health -Related Goods ,\" as well as Opinion 2.3.2 , 17 \"Professionalism in the Use of Social Media .\" Th e Council will continue to review existing 18 guidance in contemplation of the relevant issues identified above and anticipates submitting a 19 report to the House of Delegates at a subsequent meeting . 20 \u00a9 2023 American Medical Association.

REPORT OF THE COUNCIL ON ETHICAL AND JUDICIAL AFFAIRS CEJA Report 08-A-23 Subject: Judicial Function of the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs - Annual Report Presented by: Peter A. Schwartz , MD, Chair At the 2003 Annual Meeting, the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs (CEJA) presented a 1 detailed explanation of its judicial function. This undertaking was motivated in part by the 2 considerable attention professionalism has received in many areas of medicine, including the 3 concept of professional self -regulation. 4 5 CEJA has authority under the Bylaws of the American Medical Association (AMA) to disapprove 6 a membership application or to take action against a member. The disciplinary process begins when 7 a possible violation of the Principles of Medical Ethics or illegal or other unethical conduct by an 8 applicant or member is reported to the AMA. This information most often comes from statements 9 made in the membership application form, a report of disciplinary action taken by state l icensing 10 authorities or other membership organizations, or a report of action taken by a government tribunal. 11 12 The Council rarely re -examines determinations of liability or sanctions imposed by other entities. 13 However, it also does not impose its own sanct ions without first offering a hearing to the physician. 14 CEJA can impose the following sanctions: applicants can be accepted into membership without any 15 condition, placed under monitoring, or placed on probation. They also may be accepted, but be the 16 object of an admonishment, a reprimand, or censure. In some cases, their application can be 17 rejected. Existing members similarly may be placed under monitoring or on probation, and can be 18 admonished, reprimanded or censured. Additionally, their membership may be suspended or they 19 may be expelled. Updated rules for review of membership can be found at https://www.ama - 20 assn.org/governing- rules . 21 22 Beginning with the 2003 report, the Council has provided an annual tabulation of its judicial 23 activities to the House of Delegates. In the appendix to this report, a tabulation of CEJA's activities 24 during the most recent reporting period is presented. 25 CEJA Rep. 08- A-23-- page 2 of 2 APPENDIX CEJA Judicial Function Statistics APRIL 1, 2022 - MARCH 31, 2023 Physicians Reviewed SUMMARY OF CEJA ACTIVITIES 4 Determinations of no probable cause 18 Determinations following a plenary hearing 33 Determinations after a finding of probable cause, based only on the written record, after the physician waived the plenary hearing Physicians Reviewed PROBATION/MONITORING STATUS 16 Members placed on Probation/Monitoring during reporting interval 14 Members placed on Probation without reporting to Data Bank 8 Probation/Monitoring concluded satisfactorily during reporting interval 0 Memberships suspended due to non -compliance with the terms of probation 14 Physicians on Probation/Monitoring at any time during reporting interval who paid their AMA membership dues 8 Physicians on Probation/Monitoring at any time during reporting interval who did not pay their AMA membership dues Physicians Reviewed FINAL DETERMINATIONS FOLLOWING INITIAL REVIEWS 9 No sanction or other type of action 2 Monitoring 14 Probation 1 Revocation 6 Suspension 2 Denied 1 Suspension lifted 4 Censure 12 Reprimand 4 Admonish \u00a9 2023 American Medical Association.

REPORT OF THE COUNCIL ON LONG RANGE PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT CLRPD Report 0 1-A-23 Subject: Demographic Characteristics of the House of Delegates and AMA Leadership Presented by: Edmund Cabbabe, MD, Chair This informational report is prepared in odd numbered years by the Council on Long Range 1 Planning and Development (CLRPD ), pursuant to A merican Medical Association (A MA) Policy 2 G-600.035, \"The Demographics of the House of Delegates.\" This policy states: 3 4 (1) A report on the demographics of our AMA House of Delegates will be issued annually and 5 include information regarding age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, life stage, present 6 employment, and self -designated specialty. (2) As one means of encouraging greater awareness 7 and responsiveness to diversity, our AMA will prepare and distribute a state- by-state 8 demographic analysis of the House of Delegates, with comparisons to the physician population 9 and to our AMA physician membership every other year. (3) Future reports on the 10 demographic characteristics of the House of Delegates should, whenever possible, identify and 11 include information on successful initiatives and best practices to promote diversity within 12 state and specialty society delegations. 13 14 This report will survey the current demographic makeup of AMA leadership in accordance with 15 AMA Policy G- 600.030, \"Diversity of AMA Delegations,\" which states that, \"Our AMA 16 encourages...state medical associations and national medical specialty societies to review the 17 composition of their AMA delegations with regard to enhancing diversity...\" and AMA Policy G 18 610.010, \"Nominations,\" which states in part: 19 20 Guidelines for nominations for AMA elected offices include the following... (2) the Federation 21 (in nominating or spon soring candidates for leadership positions), the House of Delegates (in 22 electing Council and Board members), and the Board, the Speakers, and the President (in 23 appointing or nominating physicians for service on AMA Councils or in other leadership 24 positions ) to consider the need to enhance and promote diversity... 25 26 Like previous reports, this document compares AMA leadership with the entire AMA membership 27 and with the overall U.S. physician population. Medical students are included in all references to 28 the total physician population, which is consistent with past practice. For the purposes of this 29 report, AMA leadership includes delegates; alternate delegates; the Board of Trustees (BOT); and 30 councils and leadership of sections and special groups (hereafter referred to as CSSG; see detailed 31 listing in Appendix A). 32 33 Additionally, this report includes information on successful initiatives and best practices to 34 promote diversity of state and specialty society delegations, pursuant to part 3 of Policy G -600.035. 35 36 DATA SOURCES 37 38 CLRPD Rep. 01- A-23 -- page 2 of 25 Lists of delegates and alternate delegates are maintained by the Office of House of Delegates 1 (HOD) Affairs and based on official rosters provided by the relevant societies. The lists used in this 2 report reflect year -end 2022 delegation rost ers. AMA council rosters as well as listings for the 3 governing bodies of each of the sections and special groups were provided by the relevant AMA 4 staff. 5 6 Data on demographic characteristics of individuals are taken from the AMA Physician Masterfile, 7 which provides comprehensive demographic, medical education, and other information on all 8 graduates of U.S. medical schools and international medical graduates (IMGs) who have 9 undertaken residency training in the United States. Data on AMA members and the total physician 10 population are taken from the year -end 2022 Masterfile after it is considered final. 11 12 Some key considerations must be kept in mind regarding the information in this report. Members 13 of the BOT, the American Medical Political Action Committee (AM PAC) and the Council on 14 Legislation who are not physicians or medical students are not included in any tables. Vacancies in 15 delegation rosters mean the total number of delegates is fewer than the number allotted at the 2022 16 Interim Meeting, and the number of alternate delegates is nearly always less than the full allotment. 17 Race and ethnicity information, which is provided directly by physicians, is missing for 18 approximately one -fifth of AMA members (20.0%) and the total U.S. physician population 19 (20.4%), l imiting the ability to draw firm conclusions. 20 21 Readers are reminded that most AMA leadership groups considered herein designate seats for 22 students and resident/fellow physicians. This affects some characteristics, particularly age, as well 23 as the makeup of age-related groups, namely the student, resident, and young physician sections. 24 To provide further clarity on this point, an additional table has been included in the appendix 25 illustrating demographic characteristics and career stage breakdowns of AMA sec tion governing 26 councils. 27 28 CHARACTERISTICS OF AMA LEADERSHIP 29 30 Table 1 displays the basic characteristics of AMA leadership, AMA members, and all physicians 31 and medical students. Raw counts for Tables 1 and 2 can be found in Appendix A. Upward- and 32 downward- pointing arrows indicate an increase or decrease of at least two percentage points 33 compared to CLRPD Report 1-A-21, \"Demographic Characteristics of the House of Delegates and 34 AMA Leadership\"; the following observations refer to changes since CLRPD Report 1 -A-21. 35 Changes are not highlighted for the BOT due to the small number of Board members. Between 36 year-end 2020 and year -end 2022, AMA membership increased by 3,061 members, a 1.1% 37 increase. 38 39 Little change was observed in the age breakdow n of AMA membership and leadership. 40 The share of delegates in the 60 -69 age group decreased by 3.9 percentage points since 41 2020, but no age group saw a significant increase. Likewise, among councils and 42 leadership of sections and special groups, two age groups (under age 40 and age 50-59) 43 saw increased representation, while two others ( 40-49 and 60- 69) saw their percentages 44 decrease, but these changes seem more attributable to fluctuation than any specific trend. 45 46 A continued increase in female representation among AMA delegates and alternate 47 delegates was observed , as females in 2022 made up 3 4.3% of delegates (up from 30.7% in 48 2020) and 43.7% of alternate delegates (38.3% in 2020). Over the past decade , the number 49 of female delegates and alternate delegates has increased steadily ; in 2012, 20.2% of 50 delegates and 21.5% of alternate delegates identified as female. 51 CLRPD Rep. 01-A-23 -- page 3 of 25 1 The percentage of white delegates and alternate delegates decreased by 3.5 percentage 2 points and 4.4 percentage points, res pectively . 3 The percentage of international medical graduate (IMG) alternate delegates increased by 4 2.7 percentage points. 5 Table 1.

Among alternate delegates, d ecreases were 3 observed among established physicians (from 49.7% in 2020 to 44.0 % in 2022) , employees 4 of the U.S. government (4.1% in 2020, 2.1% in 2022) and internal medicine specialists 5 (19.2% in 2020, 15.1% in 2022). The percentage of senior physician alternate delegates 6 increased from 19.4% to 22.5% since 2020. 7 8 Among CSSG, increases were observed among young physicians ( 9.6% in 2020, 13.2% in 9 2022), employees of non-government hospital s (4.2% in 2020, 6.6% in 2022) and internal 10 medicine specialists ( 18.7% in 2020, 22.2% in 2022). Decreases were observed among 11 senior physicians ( 28.9% in 2020, 24.6% in 2022), employees of state or local government 12 hospitals ( 10.8% in 2020, 7.2% in 2022) and 13.3% in 2020, 9.6% in 13 2022). 14 Table 2.

Add itionally, some societies reported making conscious outreach efforts to 21 medical students , including those from h istorically black colleges and universities , with the 22 goal of increasing diversity within the ir respective societies, and in the case of specialties, 23 among the specialty itself. 24 25 Initiatives and summits: societies mentioned ins tituting a variety of initiatives focused on 26 issues related to equity, diversity, and inclusion. These included convening members with 27 interest in addressing lifestyle -related chronic disease health disparities, training and 28 7 See Appendix B for a listing of specialty classifications.

In the broadest sense, a supply chain includes all activities related to manufacturing, the extraction of raw materials, processin g, warehousing, and transportation. Hence, for large multinational companies that manufacture complex products , supply chains are highly complex socioeconomic systems. To strengthen and stabilize the medical supply chain, it is important to understand the various aspects of the medical supply chain, to identify the challenges that resulted in supply chain disruptions during the pandemic, and to consider several strategies to mitigate medical supply chain disruptions for the future. Over decades, the medical supply chain has assembled substantial global networks; however, the pandemic has exposed structural weaknesses and cracks within these networks. Many medical supply distributors and health systems had adopted a \"just- in-time\" approach to supplies, by which they stocked only what they immediately needed and trusted supply chains to deliver other items quickly. At the same time, much of America's manufacturing capacity shifted abroad, where products could be made inexpensively with low labor and energy costs. While American manufacturing's share of overall output remained constant, its labor share declined as firms automated production lines and relied upon emerging technologies. That production and distribution system worked as planned until difficulties in the global supply chain disrupted those practices and created problems in supply, safety, and security. Today's problems include a wide array of medical supply and equipment shortages that can be traced to component scarcities, factory closures, backlog ged ports, and transportation glitches. The disruptions caused by the \"just -in-time\" approach have led to calls for greater domestic manufacturing capability through onshoring or reshoring (bringing production back to the United States) or nearshoring (bringing production back to friendly countries not far from the U.S., such as Canada an d Mexico). One of the key areas affected by the pandemic w as the manufacturing facilities making active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for the U.S. market 72% of the medical supplies and APIs for making drugs found in the United States have resulted fro m outsourcing to other countries. While l ocally sourced API production will likely become an increasingly important part of government policy and pharmaceutical company commercial strategy, diversifying supply chains is expensive, and the cost of reconfigu ring them will fall on consumers or governments. Factors that disrupt medical supply chains include infectious disease outbreaks, geopolitical conflict, economic conditions, and quality- related issues at production sites. These factors can impact daily he alth care, as well as the profitability of manufacturing companies. In 2021, virtually all U.S. hospitals and health care systems (99%) reported challenges in procuring needed supplies, including shortages of key items and significant price increases. Most experts agree that stakeholders must come together to develop consistent, meaningful metrics that reflect a sophisticated approach to managing and preventing shortages that pose risks to health care systems and patients. There are several automated technologies available that health care systems can use to quickly access data and projections: cloud- based, radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology allows for real- time tracking that prevents shortages while enabling health care professionals to view their inventory quickly and accurately; internet -connected medical devices and equipment enable different systems in health care organizations to speak to one another and ensure information is updated across departments, rather than being held up in siloes ; and analytics platform s, powered by artificial intelligence (AI), can be embedded in an electronic health record (EHR) to allow users to access benchmarking data so they can analyze their overall performance. In a recent McKinsey survey of U.S. health system and supply chain executives, three themes emerged as critical to a high -performing medical supply chain function: Engage front -line physicians in supply decisions, Jointly set goals across facilities and functions , and Invest in accurate, actionable data and analytics. While the pandemic caused major disruptions in health care with severe consequences, it also spurred medical and technological innovations. Telemedicine has become common, medical professionals have urged adoption of new models of care, shifting from cost- efficiency to long- term planning, and public-private partnerships have been formed to deal with current and future crises. Patient care has historically been limited to a person's ability to arrive at a hospital or care facility and restricted by the supply chain's capacity to swiftly provide the correct product for that patient's individual need. Technology has recently enhanced treatment products to allow patients to receive care outside of a traditional care fa cility. The use of 3D printing and new forms of diagnostics allow for more personalized treatment to be provided while saving manufacturing costs. Artificial Intelligence ( AI) and predictive analytics \u2014while being used nominally right now by physicians and health care organizations\u2014 can, should , and will be used to ensure the right items, from the right sources, at the right prices for the right outcomes are ordered at the right times and in the right quantities to prevent shortages and price gouging. This will help to ensure financial stability of medical practices and health care organizations while mitigating patient risk. Although technology is a crucial enabler of resilience through supply chain digitalization, using it as the tip of the spear to address weaknesses may only partially fix the issues. Comprehensive solutions that position technology as a component alongside people and processes can help make the medical supply chain more resilient. Several large health care organizations have developed partnerships with shared goals and vision between physicians and hospital administrations. What is necessary to further these efforts is an investment in evidence tools and the creation of a physician role in the supply chain, which is becomin g more common. The future of the medical supply chain entails transparent communication of supply chain issues and patient needs between suppliers and health care professionals who can work together to create methods that enhance situational awareness. The medical supply chain can gain physician trust by communicating regularly and providing insight into the inner workings of logistics . Physicians can articulate needs, and medical supply chain professionals can provide information about the prices of products and transportation, outcomes, and alternative options for their products. Addressing these issues can improve the relationship between the supply chain, physicians, and health care organizations. Effective supply chain performance directly links to pa tient outcomes and clinical safety, influencing much more than personal protective equipment ( PPE). 2 \u00a9 2023 American Medical Association.

REPORT OF THE COUNCIL ON LONG RANGE PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT CLRPD Report 02-A-23 Subject: A Primer on the Medical Supply Chain Presented by: Edmond Cabbabe, MD, Chair The critical medical shortages that resulted from COVID -19 hampered the pandemic response and 1 cascaded into defaults of other aspects of U.S. health care delivery. Th is informational report was 2 developed to provide members of the House of Delegates (HOD) with some history of medical 3 supply chain shortages, the structure of the medical supply chain, globalization of the U.S. medical 4 supply chain, causes and consequences of failures, U.S. governmental actions to mitigate issues, 5 and onshoring and nearshoring str ategies for the U.S. medical supply chain. I t also identifies 6 opportunities for physicians and health systems to improve medical supply chain resilience and 7 performance. 8 9 BRIEF HISTORY OF U.S. MEDICAL SUPPLY CHAIN SHORTAGES 10 11 Shortages of medical supplies i n the United States due to supply chain issues are not new. 12 13 During War II, the supply of quinine that was primarily sourced in the Japanese-occupied 14 East Indies, was cut off. The United States suddenly found itself facing malaria across the 15 globe without sufficient treatment, which resulted in major hospitalizations from malarial 16 infections throughout different battles and theaters.1 17 In September 2017, Hurricane Maria devastated the territory of Puerto Ricoproducer of 18 50% of America's supply of intravenous salinecatapulting hospitals nationwide into a 19 shortage.2 20 In late 2019, SARS- CoV -2 emerged from China and rapidly evolved into a pandemic, 21 resulting in disrupted production and export of medications and personal protective 22 equipment (PPE) around the world. 23 24 The critical medical shortages that resulted from COVID -19 hampered the pandemic response and 25 cascaded into defaults of other aspects of U.S. health care delivery. What differentiates COVID -19 26 from prior supply chain disruptions is the level of uncertainty and the length of the disruption, as 27 well as its simultaneous global impact. Additionally, unlike most other disruptions, COVID -19 has 28 affected not only the supply of, but also the demand for products and services. 29 30 MEDICAL SUPPLY CHAIN STRUCTURE 31 32 The medical supply chain is an extensive network of systems, components, and processes that 33 collectively work to ensure medicines and other h ealth care supplies are manufactured, distributed, 34 and provided to patients. In the broadest sense, a supply chain includes all activities related to 35 manufacturing, the extraction of raw materials, processing, warehousing, and transportation. 36 Hence, for la rge multinational companies that manufacture complex products supply chains are 37 CLRPD Rep. 02- A-23 -- page 2 of 12 highly complex socioeconomic systems. There are many players in the medical supply chain; 1 however, manufacturers and distributors are particularly prominent. 2 3 Manufacturers ar e the first link in the supply chain and make the medicines and health care 4 supplies patients and physicians rely on. Manufacturers acquire raw materials for 5 production of approved products; conduct research, develop, and process medicines and 6 products; identify what product(s) is needed and if enough supply will be available based 7 on demand; conduct safety trial testing; and package approved products for distribution. 8 Distributors are the second link in the medical supply chain. Distributors repackage, 9 relabel, and ensure special handling for unique products; obtain medicines and products 10 from manufacturing facilities and distribute to providers, health care facilities or other 11 general areas of need; and manage temperature and climate conditions for safe 12 transportation of medicines and products. Distributors purchase drugs and medical 13 products in bulk from manufacturers and maintain large stocks in strategic locations across 14 the country. Some wholesalers specialize in dealing with a particular range of prod ucts, 15 such as biologics or to specific types of customers. 16 Providers (hospitals, pharmacies, dialysis centers, urgent care, assisted living, and long- 17 term care facilities) submit orders to distributors; refill prescriptions for patients; and 18 identify short ages in inventory and potential distribution challenges. 19 Patients and communities with unique medical needs that require specific products 20 influence the demand for medicines and products. 21 22 To strengthen and stabilize the medical supply chain, it is import ant to understand the various 23 aspects of the medical supply chain, to identify the challenges that resulted in supply chain 24 disruptions during the pandemic, and to consider several strategies to mitigate medical supply 25 chain disruptions for the future. 26 27 GLOBALIZATION OF U.S. MEDICAL SUPPLY CHAIN 28 29 Over decades, the medical supply chain has assembled substantial global networks; however, the 30 COVID -19 pandemic has exposed structural weaknesses and cracks within these networks. Many 31 medical supply distributor s and health systems had adopted a \"just -in-time\" approach to supplies, 32 by which they stocked only what they immediately needed and trusted supply chains to deliver 33 other items quickly. That approach saved money because firms and hospitals did not need to build 34 extended storage facilities or keep full inventories. Rather, they kept their stocks low and refreshed 35 on an \"as needed\" basis.3 At the same time, much of America's manufacturing capacity shifted 36 abroad, where products could be made inexpensively wi th low labor and energy costs.4 Further, 37 while American manufacturing's share of overall output remained constant, its labor share declined 38 as firms automated production lines and relied upon emerging technologies.5 That production and 39 distribution syste m worked as planned until issues in the global supply chain disrupted those 40 practices, creating problems in terms of suppl y, safety, and security. 41 42 The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) reported that only 43 28% of the manufac turing facilities making active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for the U.S. 44 market were in the United States as of August 2019. This means that 72% of the medical supplies 45 and APIs for making drugs found in the United States had resulted from outsourcing to other 46 countries. A previous shortfall occurred with the anticoagulant heparin, made using pig intestines: 47 China makes 80% of the world's heparin and 60% of the U.S. supply. In 2007, an infectious 48 disease outbreak in Asia decimated pig herds, pushing heparin into short supply and doubling 49 prices. Seeking a rapid, practical solution, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 50 CLRPD Rep. 02- A-23 -- page 3 of 12 suggested using U.S. bovine heparin and asked manufacturers to submit applications that 1 demonstrated safety, efficacy, quality, a nd purity. Although the FDA cannot eliminate all possible 2 risk, it can enforce requirements, controls, and best practices to detect problems early while 3 ensuring the availability of safe and effective medications.6 4 5 As COVID -19 became a pandemic, differen t countries took steps to protect their local supplies by 6 limiting or stopping exports entirely. For example, China, which produces roughly 50% of the 7 global supply of masks at 10 million masks daily, ramped up production to 115 million daily 8 during the early phases of COVID -19, yet simultaneously terminated all mask exports, leading to a 9 gradual depletion of global stockpiles. Additionally, Germany banned the export of most of its PPE 10 supplies. In other areas where local production was not significant, essential equipment 11 procurement became vulnerable. 12 13 Virus mitigation measures continue to affect production and limit efforts to return the supply chain 14 to pre -pandemic levels. Several industry players have reduced worker levels due to fears of the 15 further spread of COVID- 19 within the workplaces. In China, port terminals temporarily closed 16 because of the country's COVID -19 zero- tolerance policy, creating lengthy shipping backlogs at 17 some of the world's largest ports. While consumer demand can increase in months, more time is 18 required to increase port capacity, build warehouses, and hire employees so that shipping can meet 19 the needs of the demand. 20 21 Problems include a wide array of medical supply and equipment shortages that can be traced to 22 component scarcities, factory closures, backlogged ports, transportation glitches, and COVID -19 23 lockdowns across the global supply chain. According to the FDA, the list of persistently scarce 24 items is long and includes latex and vinyl examination gloves, surgical gowns, laboratory reagents, 25 specimen -collection testing supplies, saline -flush syringes, and dialysis -related products.7 26 27 CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF MEDICAL SUPPLY CHAIN FAILURES 28 29 Factors that disrupt medical supply chains include infectious disease outbreaks, geopolitical 30 conflict, economic conditions, and quality- related issues at production sites. These factors can 31 impact daily health care, as well as the profitability of manufacturing companies. Once there is an 32 infectious outbreak, it may be difficult to access treatment and other health services, especially if 33 the outbreak comes with harsh control measures such as quarantines and lockdowns. Such 34 measures may generate an acute su rge in the demand for critical medical supplies and equipment, 35 which exceeds supply, leading to shortages and protocols for prioritized use. A disruptive event can 36 cause a mismatch between supply and demand in medical product supply chains in three ways: 37 38 1. Demand surge: An event drives demand for a medical product well above the normal 39 level for an extended period. For example, a major natural disaster, such as a tornado or 40 earthquake, can spike regional demand for certain medical products if these events re sult 41 in a significant number of casualties requiring medical care. As seen during COVID -19, 42 a pandemic can drive up global demand for many medical products. 43 2. Capacity reduction: One or more production or transport processes are impeded by lack 44 of assets, power, or people. For example, a natural disaster could cause a factory to lose 45 power and halt production, or regulatory barriers or manufacturing quality problems 46 could restrict the output of a supplier or producer and could even eliminate inventory 47 stock i f a product is recalled. As seen during the COVID -19 pandemic, production of 48 some products decreased because of lockdown measures, as well as acute loss of 49 workers to quarantine and illness. 50 CLRPD Rep. 02- A-23 -- page 4 of 12 3. Coordination failure: Events that prevent coordination of suppl y to meet demand can 1 cause shortages of medical products even when total supply is sufficient to meet total 2 demand. For example, geopolitical issues or communication system failures during a 3 hurricane or other natural disaster can reduce or obstruct the de livery of emergency 4 supplies into a city or region.8 5 6 The COVID- 19 pandemic led to such shortages in medical supplies as a combination of all three 7 ways, leading to gaps in medical supplies for routine health care (e.g., dialysis -related products) 8 and pandemic response (e.g., PPE, lab testing supplies and equipment, and ventilation- related 9 products) in most health care facilities around the world. 10 11 The medical supply chain may be influenced by U.S. insurance companies, hospitals, physicians, 12 employers, and regulatory agencies, with differing objectives among them. Demand for services is 13 determined by both available treatments and insurance coverage for those treatments. Decisions 14 made by one party often affect the options available to other parties, as well as the costs of these 15 options, in ways that are not well understood. Most of these complicated factors are also present, to 16 varying degrees, in industrial supply chains. 17 18 In 2021, virtually all U.S. hospitals and health care systems (99%) reported challenges in procuring 19 needed supplies, including shortages of key items and significant price increases. A Kaufman Hall 20 report noted that 80% of hospitals had significant supply shortages and had to seek new vendors for 21 supplies during the pand emic. Shortages in raw materials and components hampered the production 22 of both drugs and sophisticated medical devices. Manufacturing facilities struggled to keep up as 23 COVID -19 swept through the workplace. Labor shortages prevented medical products from being 24 transported to the places where they were needed most.9 25 26 Helium, a nonrenewable element found deep within the earth's crust, is essential for keeping 27 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines cool enough to work. With a boiling point of minus 28 452 de grees Fahrenheit, liquid helium is the coldest element on Earth. Pumped inside an MRI 29 magnet, helium lets the current travel resistance- free. However, the supply of helium is running 30 low leaving hospitals wondering how to plan with a much scarcer supply. C urrently, four of five 31 major U.S. helium suppliers are rationing the element.10 Shortages in aluminum, semiconductors, 32 wood and paper pulp, and resin are disrupting supplies of medical devices, with different business 33 sectors competing for the same raw mat erials. Those shortages have led to uneven supplies of 34 medical monitors, CT scan devices, packaging for medical supplies, and gloves. While only a 35 fraction of the world's semiconductors is in medical equipment compared with cars and consumer 36 electronics, t he components are key to a range of medical devices such as MRI machines, 37 pacemakers, glucose monitors, CT scanners, defibrillators, multiparameter monitors, and 38 ultrasound machines. As a result, hospitals are experiencing long order delays for equipment 39 because of the semiconductor shortage.11 40 41 Drugs used in the United States involve raw materials from all over the world. Many chemical 42 inputs are manufactured in India and China and then shipped to the United States. Regardless of the 43 root cause, drug short ages can lead to substitutions for available medications that are costlier and/or 44 less effective. In some instances, hospital pharmacies must compound and modify products, which 45 adds workload and potential error.12 The A merican M edical A ssociation (AMA) Council on 46 Science and Public Health (CSAPH) has issued eleven reports on drug shortages. AMA Policy H - 47 100.956, \"National Drug Shortages,\" directs the CSAPH to continue to evaluate the drug shortage 48 issue and report back at least annually to the House of De legates on progress made in addressing 49 drug shortages in the United States. CSAPH Report 01 -I-22 provides an update on continuing 50 CLRPD Rep. 02- A-23 -- page 5 of 12 trends in national drug shortages and ongoing efforts to further evaluate and address this critical 1 public health issue.13 2 3 The United States recently experienced a surge in respiratory illnesses, a potential \"tripledemic\" of 4 three viruses: respiratory syncytial virus the influenza virus, and the COVID -19 coronavirus. While 5 antibiotics like amoxicillin typically are not effective against such respiratory viruses, they can be 6 important treatments for secondary bacterial infections that may occur when respiratory tract 7 defenses and the immune system in general are battling a viral infection. Despite the best efforts to 8 address root causes of drug shortages, the United States has a dysfunctional, opaque medical 9 supply chain. There is still no easy way to scale up production to meet excess demand. Moreover, 10 there remains a limited profit motive to do better, particularly for low -cost m edications such as 11 amoxicillin . 12 13 U.S. GOVERNMENT ACTIONS TO MITIGATE MEDICAL SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES 14 15 During the COVID -19 public health emergency, the FDA took many actions to ensure that health 16 care professionals had timely and continued access to high -quality medical devices. These actions 17 included Emergency Use Authorizations) and guidance permits to expand available resources for 18 diagnostic, therapeutic, and medical devices in high demand. Fur ther, President Trump invoked the 19 Defense Production Act and released government funds to help American companies build 20 facilities and expand production capabilities for medical equipment.14 21 22 In October 2020, in response to Executive Order 1394410, the FDA published a List of Essential 23 Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs (described herein as EM). This 24 executive order sought to ensure sufficient, reliable, and long- term domestic production of these 25 products and minimize potential shortage s. The published EM list contained 227 drug and 26 biological product essential medicines and countermeasures, including analgesics, antivirals, 27 anticoagulants, antihypertensives, and antimicrobials.15 The Center for Drug Evaluation and 28 Research (CDER) Site Catalog includes approximately 1,100 locations that manufacture at least 29 one product on the EM list. There are 1,686 sites that manufacture an active pharmaceutical 30 ingredient (API), of which 354 manufacture API for EM products. Currently, 23% of API 31 manufacturing sites are in the United States; for EM, this drops to 19%. These data illustrate that 32 only a minority of drug manufacturing sites are domestic. Overall, API and finish dose form 33 manufacturing are heavily dependent on foreign manufacturing sit es. 34 35 Since early 2020, the United States has made progress in strengthening the health care supply chain 36 by addressing concerns regarding domestic manufacturing and supply chain surge capabilities. In 37 2021, President Biden issued Executive Order (EO) 14017, On America's Supply Chains . The 100- 38 Day Review under this order directed the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) 39 to identify products for which onshoring (bringing production back to the U.S.) may be advisable. 40 HHS subsequently issued a 2022 r eport that identifies successes and practical strategies to further 41 U.S. goals for America's supply chain and industrial base. Particular efforts should be directed at 42 expanding the public health industrial base by working across government agencies, acade mia, and 43 the private sector, and strengthening capabilities to monitor and manage supply chain bottlenecks.16 44 Note that Section 510(j)(3) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act , which was added by the 45 recent CARES Act, requires FDA registered sites to r eport annually the amounts of drugs 46 manufactured for U.S. commercial distribution. Combined with FDA information about the 47 location of manufacturing sites, these data should enable the FDA to perform better manufacturing 48 site surveillance.17 49 CLRPD Rep. 02- A-23 -- page 6 of 12 In 2020, the FDA reported 43 new drug shortages after a peak of 251 shortages in 2011.18 On the 1 surface, this looks like tremendous progress; however, this measurement does not consider the 2 scope, scale, or severity of the shortage. The FDA metric measures every short age the same way, 3 whether a drug is dispensed 20 times or 20,000 times a month. Moreover, not every shortage is the 4 same. In response to the public health crisis, some U.S. hospital groups, startups, and nonprofits 5 began making their own sterile injectable s and other medicines as a short -term workaround to 6 combat persistent drug shortages.19 Experts anticipate that efforts by hospitals to have more direct 7 control over their critical drug supply chains will continue to evolve as they work to find a 8 sustainab le, cost -effective, and safe model. Joint public -private sector efforts, such as the creation 9 of a Strategic Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient Reserve (SAPIR), will be instrumental in defining 10 how these products are supplied in the future.20 11 12 The 2013 Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) outlines steps to build an electronic, 13 interoperable system to track and trace prescription drugs.21 The original aim of the DSCSA was to 14 enhance the ability of the FDA to regulate drug safety and help protect patients. H owever, this 15 system could improve the management of drug product shortages as well.22 Serialization 16 (assignment of a unique serial number to each suppliable prescription product) in the drug supply 17 chain could vastly improve an organization's ability to ma nage inventory. A pilot DSCSA program 18 with the FDA showed the potential for using IBM blockchain technology to connect disparate data 19 for tracking and tracing prescription medications and vaccines in the United States.23 20 21 In 2022, the NASEM published the c ongressionally mandated report, Building Resilience into the 22 Nation's Medical Product Supply Chains . The report called for the FDA to track sourcing, quality, 23 volume, and capacity information, and to establish a public database for health systems, inclusive 24 of failure -to-supply penalties in contracts. In addition, the report recommended that the federal 25 government optimize inventory stockpiling to respond to medical product shortages.24 26 27 While the federal government can generate greater economies of scale f or the procurement of 28 health care supplies during a pandemic, local governments can identify lower socioeconomic 29 groups and minorities that are particularly vulnerable to both the health and economic aspects of a 30 pandemic. As a result, they can employ resources more efficiently for a rise or fall in cases and 31 hospitalizations. 32 33 ONSHORING AND NEARSHORING STRATEGIES 34 35 Concerns unleashed by the pandemic and dependence on foreign manufacturers combined to 36 increase risks and raise doubts regarding \"just -in-time\" practices.25 The disruptions caused by this 37 approach have led to calls for greater domestic manufacturing capability through onshoring or 38 reshoring (bringing production back to the United States) or nearshoring (bringing production back 39 to friendly countries not far from the U nited States , such as Canada and Mexico). A European 40 Parliament report found modest benefits to reshoring in the United Kingdom, United States and 41 Japan and argued that reshoring should be primarily focused on specific critical sec tors and 42 products with pronounced supply bottlenecks, rather than across -the-board. Targeted reshoring was 43 advised because host countries often do not have the production facilities and/or workforce 44 required for wholesale reshoring.26 Both onshoring and ne arshoring should consider the ownership 45 of the manufacturing: a foreign company can own domestic manufacturing facilities and still 46 monopolize production. 47 48 One of the key areas affected by the pandemic was the API market. Research by McKinsey shows 49 that supply chains in the pharmaceutical industry are more global than in other sectors, and there is 50 a tendency to source certain materials from a particular region. For instance, 86% of the 51 CLRPD Rep. 02- A-23 -- page 7 of 12 streptomycin in North America and 9 6% of the chloramphenicol in the European Union come from 1 China. Diversifying supply chain materials is an option that pharmaceutical companies could 2 pursue to reduce their exposure through onshoring. McKinsey estimates that 38% to 60% of the 3 internationa l pharmaceutical trade, worth $236 billion to $377 billion in 2018, could be considered 4 for onshoring. Locally sourced API production will likely become an increasingly important part of 5 government policy and pharmaceutical company commercial strategy. How ever, diversifying 6 supply chains is expensive, and the cost of reconfiguring them will fall on consumers or 7 governments. Further, the risk from regional domestic disasters in the vicinity of manufacturing 8 and distribution facilities must be assessed. 27 9 10 The United States once led the world in semiconductor manufacturing yet has fallen behind. Other 11 countries, especially in Asia, made deliberate investments to build powerful chipmakers in their 12 own countries. Foreign state subsidies created a ~30% cost adv antage for foreign chipmaking 13 plants, and the resulting advantage is startling: in 1990, the United States supplied 37% of the 14 world's chips, but now only 11%. This outcome has undermined U.S. technology leadership with 15 significant economic and national se curity implications: a recent White House study concluded that 16 \"our reliance on imported chips introduces new vulnerabilities into the critical semiconductor 17 supply chain.\"28 18 19 In 2019, the U.S. medical end- use market accounted for $5.6 billion in total se miconductor sales 20 roughly 11% of the global industrial semiconductor market and 1.3% of the total semiconductor 21 market. However, 47% of the chips sold worldwide are designed in the United States. Meanwhile, 22 the medical semiconductor segment is growing fas ter than the overall industrial semiconductor 23 market, which is driven by long- term trends of an aging population, the rise of telehealth, the move 24 to portable and wearable devices, and the applications of artificial intelligence.29 Despite being a 25 small pe rcentage of the overall semiconductor chip market, there is an urgent need for chips in 26 medical device manufacturing.30 27 28 Recognition of chip vulnerabilities led Congress to pass and President Biden to sign the CHIPS and 29 Science Act in August 2022. This law provides $52.7 billion in aid to the semiconductor industry 30 along with other incentives to build new semiconductor production facilities in the United States.31 31 32 OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE MEDICAL SUPPLY CHAIN PERFORMANCE 33 34 Since disruptions in medical supp ly chains have the potential to seriously impact patient care and 35 safety, health care systems need the capacity to proactively foresee, absorb, and adapt to shocks 36 and structural changes in a way that allows them to sustain required operations, resume opti mal 37 performance as quickly as possible, transform their structure and functions, and reduce their 38 vulnerability to similar shocks and structural changes in the future.32 Most experts agree that 39 stakeholders must come together to develop consistent, meanin gful metrics that reflect a 40 sophisticated approach to managing and preventing shortages that pose risks to health care systems 41 and patients. 42 43 There are several automated technologies available that health care systems can use to quickly 44 access data and pr ojections: 45 46 Cloud- based, radio- frequency identification (RFID) technology allows for real -time 47 tracking that prevents shortages while enabling health care professionals to view their 48 inventory quickly and accurately. 49 CLRPD Rep. 02- A-23 -- page 8 of 12 By tapping into the Internet of Things, internet -connected medical devices and equipment 1 enable different systems in health care organizations to speak to one another and ensure 2 information is updated across departments rather than being held up in siloes. 3 A third option are analytics platform s, powered by artificial intelligence (AI), e.g., an 4 electronic health record (EHR) embedded in an AI platform. On these platforms, 5 cataloging allows users to distribute and curate all analytics in a single web -based action. 6 Users may also have access to benchmarking data so they can analyze their overall 7 performance.33 8 9 In a recent McKinsey survey of U.S. health system and supply chain executives, nearly three - 10 quarters of survey respondents agreed that \"the supply chain stands to assume an even more 11 strategic role.\" Three themes emerged as critical to a high -performing supply chain function: 12 13 Engage front -line physician s in supply decisions. In high- performing organizations, 14 physicians play an integral role in supply chain initiatives: they provide input on supplier 15 selection and contracting strategies, including their financial impact; they support 16 compliance with contract terms (for example, by committing to give a supplier a negotiated 17 share of business); they manage the use of supplies; and they contribute to achieving 18 financial, quality, or other goals. 19 Jointly set goals across facilities and functions. Supply chain initiatives may require 20 meaningful changes in behavior by some clinicians, including shifting away from their 21 suppliers of choice to clinically similar suppliers used by their peers. To assist this change, 22 systems may consider providing incentives, which can be financial or nonfinancial and 23 may include a commitment to reinvest a percentage of savings in priorities of physicians. 24 Invest in accurate, actionable data and analytics. Analytical tools are only useful if they 25 provide relevant insight s to their users, which may require individual customization and, 26 for convenience, accessibility on multiple devices. For example, a supplies cost -per-case 27 tool, which shows the cost of all supplies for a given operating- room procedure, should 28 provide the relevant views for physicians so that they can see the supplies they use, cost 29 compared to supplies used by peers, alternative supply options, and quality outcomes.34 30 31 At the 2019 Association for Health Care Resource & Materials Management conference of the 32 American Hospital Association, speakers emphasized eight points to strengthen relationships 33 between physicians and PURE (Physicians Understanding, Respecting, and Engaging Supply 34 Chain) professionals: 35 36 Share meaningful data with physicians . Physicians ar e empiricists, motivated by data. As a 37 result, health systems should provide meaningful data at a consistent cadence to 38 physicians, perhaps quarterly. 39 Welcome partnerships in achieving the strategic goals of the organization. Hospital 40 systems that work wi th independent physicians should bring them into supply chain 41 decision -making to include clinical perspectives. 42 Use evidence- based principles to guide decision making. 43 Place some restriction on the number of vendors used. However, be mindful not to limit 44 physician preference items completely or force surgeons to use specific or substandard 45 products. 46 Provide context for supply chain decision making. Organizations should be very 47 transparent regarding what relationships drive their supply chain decision- making, to 48 include the use of group purchasing organizations (GPOs). Physicians understand 49 CLRPD Rep. 02- A-23 -- page 9 of 12 economies of scale, price sensitivity and market trends, and want to play a role in finding 1 solutions. 2 Include practicing physicians as part of the decision- making team . Many hospital 3 administrators do not have clinical backgrounds or currency, so it is important to have 4 physicians with clinical experience on supply chain leadership teams. Physicians can share 5 clinical insights to inform supply chain discussions, transla te clinical and supply chain 6 languages, and provide credibility for communication with physicians. 7 Update clinical pathways to include product categories that support evidence -based 8 medicine and minimize clinical variation. Data should be used to create a lgorithms and 9 care pathways for high -volume procedures. 10 Emphasize that supply chain sustainment needs logisticians and physicians. Collaboration 11 is essential to anticipate and fulfill supply needs with timeliness and realism.35 12 13 FUTURE OF THE MEDICAL SUPPLY CHAIN: IMPROVED TECHNOLOGY AND 14 PROCESSES, AND SITUATIONAL AWARENESS 15 16 While the pandemic caused major disruptions in health care with severe consequences, it also 17 spurred medical and technological innovations. Telemedicine has become common, medical 18 professionals have urged adoption of new models of care, shifting from cost -efficiency to long- 19 term planning, and public -private partnerships have been formed to deal with current and future 20 crises. One of the highest priorities for the medical supply chain i s expansion, which includes more 21 than the expansion of infrastructure and transportation in areas that have less accessibility. Patient 22 care has historically been limited to a person's ability to arrive at a hospital or care facility and 23 restricted by the supply chain's capacity to provide swiftly the correct product for that patient's 24 individual need. Technology has recently enhanced treatment products to allow patients to receive 25 care outside of a traditional care facility. A patient's treatment can now f ollow them outside of a 26 hospital or medical practice with the use of telehealth communication, at -home testing kits, and at - 27 home treatment that can be sent right to the patient's door. This requires the medical supply chain 28 to extend past hospitals and inc lude last -mile transportation to patients so that they do not have to 29 return to the hospital. At -home patient care also requires more treatments to become personalized. 30 The use of 3D printing and new forms of diagnostics allow for more personalized treatme nt to be 31 provided while saving manufacturing costs. 32 33 As physicians and health care organizations adapt to newer data processing capabilities, they can 34 more readily keep their information correct and consistent. Predictability is a must as we continue 35 to mo ve towards standardizing patient experience and more at -home care. The medical supply 36 chain will need to implement strategies that help it become more predictable to physicians and 37 health care organizations who need high visibility on their needed products . Currently, medical 38 supply chain management lacks a unified, well -adopted data standard. The Global Trade Item 39 Number (GTIN) standard is available, but adoption rates remain low compared to the universal 40 product code (UPC) fully adopted in other industrie s. Clinical and regulatory requirements 41 necessitate tracking of device information through the supply chain and in clinical EHR systems. 42 Supply chain intermediaries bear responsibility for efficient supply chain integration. 43 44 Data will be utilized to anticipate product demand. Clean data will also help supply chains stay 45 agile and not allow disruptions to hold up the services they are working to provide. Discontinued or 46 back -ordered products can greatly disrupt a supply chain, though when such things can be more 47 easily resolved with data analysis, the supply chain can become much more predictable. Data usage 48 is one strategy that will help supply chain predictability, and several strategies can help a supply 49 chain stay consistent and save costs. Some strategi es for resilience include expanding domestic 50 CLRPD Rep. 02- A-23 -- page 10 of 12 supply chain production, making product allocation needs -based, and increasing trust. The medical 1 supply chain will have data that, if it is fully captured and analyzed, will be essential for decision 2 making. Or ganized collection of data can greatly impact every stage of the supply chain, as each 3 segment can make predictions based on past data and optimize processes. 4 5 Data can greatly enhance a company's capacity to be proactive, and predictive analytics can 6 amplify that capability. Predictive analytics will help the supply chain with decision- making and 7 offer a clear way to see the ebb and flow of supply and demand. Companies can use predictive 8 analytics in new ways that help bring visibility to inventory and ensure the right products are being 9 ordered and priced correctly and that there are enough items to meet demand. Predictive analytics 10 can also help companies be more proactive in situations that significantly impact the medical 11 supply chain. The COVID -19 pandemic created new aspects of health care to predict, like the 12 number of COVID -19 cases, and the number of patients needing treatment. Predictive analytics can 13 help companies prepare for these unforeseen circumstances and prepare the supply chain for future 14 unknowns. 15 16 The use of artificial and augmented intelligence (AI) is growing throughout the health care 17 industry: AI is being used to clean data and promote efficient human effort. There are even more 18 ways that AI can be used to enhance health care and save costs. AI and predictive analytics \u2014while 19 being used nominally right now by physicians and health care organizations \u2014can, should and will 20 be used to ensure the right items, from the right sources, at the right prices for the right outcomes 21 are orde red at the right times and in the right quantities to prevent shortages and price gouging. 22 This will help to ensure financial stability of medical practices and health care organizations, while 23 mitigating patient risk. AI can help supply chains keep up dem and, by recommending stand- in 24 products if the preferred product is not available. AI algorithms can be used to fill the gap between 25 supply and demand while saving costs and eliminating human error. 26 27 Many health care organizations are addressing supply chain challenges with holistic solutions that 28 pair technology with other changes. For the supply chain to function efficiently, physicians need to 29 be involved in decision- making. Increasing supply chain resilience requires fostering an 30 organization- wide commi tment from leaders to staff members and by investing time and resources 31 necessary to identify and address the root causes of supply chain challenges. Although technology 32 is a crucial enabler of resilience through supply chain digitalization, using it as th e tip of the spear 33 to address weaknesses may only partially fix the issues. Comprehensive solutions that position 34 technology as a component alongside people and processes can help make the medical supply 35 chain more resilient. Several large health care organizations across the country have developed 36 partnerships with shared goals and vision between physicians and hospital administrations. What is 37 necessary to further these efforts is an investment in evidence tools and the creation of a physician 38 role in the supply chain, which is becoming more common. 39 40 Some disruptions in a patient's care can be attributed to limited situational awareness between 41 physicians and the supply chain. When physicians do not have knowledge of the products in the 42 supply chain, they cannot provide the best treatment possible. When the supply chain lacks clear 43 communication with physicians, medical practices, and health care facilities, it is difficult to know 44 the demand for products and when they should arrive. The future of the medi cal supply chain 45 entails transparent communication of supply chain issues and patient needs between suppliers and 46 health care professionals. Supply chain professionals and physicians can work together to create 47 methods that enhance situational awareness. P hysicians can articulate needs, and medical supply 48 chain professionals can provide information about the prices of products and transportation, 49 outcomes, and alternative options for their products. Addressing these issues can improve the 50 relationship betwe en the supply chain and physicians and health care organizations. The medical 51 CLRPD Rep. 02-A-23 -- page 11 of 12 supply chain can gain physician trust by communicating regularly and providing insight into the 1 inner workings of log istics . 2 3 Adaptability and efficiency are crucial in today's health care supply chain environment. If a 4 company's methods are too rigid, it will not be able to adapt quickly to unexpected changes. 5 Furthering relationships between clinicians and suppliers will help a supply chain boost its 6 robustness. Having trusting relationships between distributors and manufacturers, as well as 7 effective contracting models, will create a strong network within the health care supply chain that 8 can adapt smoothly while providing the most efficient services possible. Effective supply chain 9 performance directly links to patient outcomes and clinical safety, influencing much more than 10 PPE. Prior to the COVID epidemic, many physician leaders recognized the value of supply chain 11 excellence; that value is now apparent to all physicians. 12 References 1 Becktold H. Cruz A. Kaziny B.

REPORT 06 OF THE COUNCIL ON MEDICAL SERVICE (A- 23) Health Care Marketplace Plan Selection Informational Report EXECUTIVE SUMMARY At the 2022 Interim Meeting, the House of Delegates adopted Policy D -165.933, \"Health Care Marketplace Plan Selection.\" This policy directs the American Medical Association ( AMA) to re-evaluate and study the effectiveness of the current plan options in the health care marketplace to adequately provide choice and competition, especially in communities in close proximity to multiple states (insurance markets) and submit a report to the AMA House of Delegates at the 2023 Annual Meeting. This report, which is presented for information to the House of Delegates, provides updated information on insurer competition in health insurance exchanges, insurer concentration in exchange markets, and policies impacting the marketplace in 2023. Additionally, the report summ arizes key AMA polic ies that strongly support competition and choice in the health insurance marketplace. Insurer participation in the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) marketplace has increased for five consecutive years, enrollment has surpassed 16 million people, and the exchanges are generally functioning well. Still, the Council recognizes that insurer participation in the marketplace remains lower today than in 2015, when it was at its highest, and the share of plans offered by large insurers has been steadi ly growing in recent years. Many insurer exchange markets remain highly concentrated, as evidenced by data compiled in the AMA's most recent edition of Competition in Health Insurance: A Comprehensive Study of U.S. Markets. The Council shares the sentiment of many physicians that insufficient competition in the ACA marketplace remains concerning in many areas. Importantly, h ealth insurance markets are local ; across states, there is significant variation in the number of insurers and plans offered in ACA exc hanges and, within states, there may be differences in insurer participation in rural and urban regions. The Council finds that the concerns raised in Policy D -165.933 are addressed by P olicies H-165.825, H -165.839, H H -165.846, H -180.946, H -165.856, and H -180.947. W e identify no gaps in existing AMA policy and make no recommendations at this time. However, the Council believes network adequacy, which is key to maintaining healthy competition and choice in the marketplace, remains problematic and is worthy of additional study. The Council has begun looking at the need for stronger network adequacy standards for ACA, Medi care Advantage, and Medicaid plans and will present a report on this topic at the 2023 Interim Meeting. \u00a9 2023 American Medical Association.

REPORT OF THE COUNCIL ON MEDICAL SERVICE CMS Report 06- A-23 Subject: Health Care Marketplace Plan Selection Presented by: Lynn Jeffers, MD, Chair At the 2022 Interim Meeting, the House of Delegates adopted Policy D -165.933, \"Health Care 1 Marketplace Plan Selection.\" This policy directs the American Medical Association ( AMA) to 2 re-evaluate and study the effectiveness of the current plan options in the health care marketplace to 3 adequately provide choice and competition, especially in communities in close proximity to 4 multiple states (insurance markets) and submit a report to the AMA House of Delegates at the 2023 5 Annual Meeting. This report, which is presented for information to the House of Delegates, 6 provides updated information on insurer competition in health insurance exchanges, insurer 7 concentration in exchange markets, and policies impacting the marketplace in 2023. Additionally, 8 the report summ arizes AMA policy that strongly supports competition and choice in the health 9 insurance marketplace. 10 11 BACKGROUND 12 13 The intent of individual health insurance exchanges required under the Affordable Care Act ( ACA) 14 is to broaden coverage through a patient -friendly market and ensure healthy competition among 15 plans. Products sold in the ACA marketplace are required to be certified as qualified health plans 16 (QHPs); and as a condition of QHP certification, insurers \u2014or issuers \u2014must meet certain standards 17 and require ments designed to protect patients while encouraging health plan competition and 18 choice. Robust competition among issuers participating in the insurance exchanges is essential to 19 health plan affordability and choice, as evidenced by research showing that t he participation of 20 additional insurers on an exchange is associated with lower premiums and, conversely, regions 21 with fewer insurers have higher premiums.1 Across states, there is significant variation in the 22 number of insurers and plans offered in ACA e xchanges and, within states, there may be 23 differences in insurer participation in rural and urban areas. 24 25 INSURER PARTICIPATION IN HEALTH INSURANCE EXCHANGES 26 27 Insurer participation in the marketplace has been an ongoing concern since the ACA exchanges 28 began operating and have gone up and down in the ensuing years in response to marketplace 29 regulations and insurers entering and exiting the market. After a period of decreasing insurer 30 participation between 2016 and 2018 (participation was at its highest in 2015), 2023 marks the fifth 31 consecutive year of increases in the number of insurers offering ACA marketplace plans. In fact, 32 most people shopping for coverage on an exchange must navigate through scores of offerings 33 before choosing a health plan that best meets their needs and budget, a process that can be both 34 daunting and confusing. This year, consumers using the federal exchange through HealthCare.gov 35 will have , on average, more than 113 QHPs to choose from, up from over 60 plan options in 2021 36 and just over 25 options in 2019.2 An issue brief released by the Office of Health Policy for the 37 Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) showed that, in 2021, nearly three - 38 quarters of HealthCare.gov users had more than 60 plan options to choose from, and over a quarter 39 selected from more than 160 plans.3 Within a specific metal tier (i.e., bronze, silver, gold, or 40 CMS Rep. 06-A-23 -- page 2 of 9 platinum) , or even within a particular me tal tier and a specific issuer, consumers in many areas can 1 still have an abundance of plan options from which to choose. 2 3 In the 33 marketplaces using the HealthCare.gov platform, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid 4 Services (CMS) has announced that there is greater choice of insurers in 2023 with only one 5 percent of enrollees having access to a single QHP issuer, the lowest in marketplace history.4 The 6 Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO) has reported that, in 7 HealthCare.gov s tates, 92 percent of enrollees have three or more insurers from which to choose 8 this year compared to 89 percent of enrollees in 2022. There are 220 total insurers participating in 9 HealthCare.gov states, an increase of seven from 2022, and the average enrollee has access to 10 between six and seven issuers, and over 113 QHPs.5 A CCIIO map 11 (https://www.cms.gov/files/document/py2023-county-coverage-map.pdf ) of Plan Year 2023 12 exchange insurers, which includes federally -facilitated exchange data as well as self -reported data 13 (updated as o f October 2022) from the 18 states operating their own exchanges, shows that only 14 three percent of counties (93) have a single insurer while 25 percent (771) have two insurers and 15 remaining counties have three or more insurers on the exchange. This contras ts with 2018 when 16 over half (51.3 percent) of counties had a single carrier, a percentage that decreased to just over 35 17 percent of counties in 2019, 24 percent in 2020, nine percent in 2021, five percent in 2022, and 18 three percent in 2023 (see appendix). County level data is important to measuring competition in 19 the ACA marketplace because many insurers offer plans in some parts of a state but not others, and 20 because health plans are priced and offered locally. 21 22 A brief from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundat ion explains that although insurer participation in 23 the ACA marketplace increased significantly between 2019 and 2021, such increases were more 24 moderate in 2022 and relatively small in 2023. 6 This year, large increases in insurer participation 25 were seen in only a small number of states, including a few non- expansion states, as insurers 26 continue to focus on areas where more uninsured people live. Although Georgia had a large 27 increase in new plan offerings in 2022, the increase in that state was much smaller in 2023 when 28 Texas had the most new offerings.7 Importantly, the share of plans offered by large health insurers, 29 including Blues plans, UnitedHealthcare, Cigna, CVS/Aetna, Centene, and Moli na, increased in the 30 marketplace while the share of smaller insurers, such as regional and provider-sponsored plans, 31 decreased from 45 percent in 2022 to 40 percent in 2023.8 Furthermore, the large national insurers 32 have tended to take over where smaller companies, including Bright Health and Oscar Health, have 33 exited markets. It is also notable that the Medicaid managed care companies Centene and Molina 34 have been steadily increasing their footprints on the exchanges. 35 36 INSURER CONCENTRATION IN EXCHANGE MAR KETS 37 38 The 2022 edition of the AMA's Competition in Health Insurance: A Comprehensive Study of U.S. 39 Markets notes that there have been large changes over time in exchange market concentration and 40 some volatility in exchange insurers' market shares and ranki ngs. According to the study's 41 analysis, there were large increases in average market concentration in the exchanges between 2015 42 and 2018, annual decreases thereafter, and a notably large decrease between 2020 and 2021 that 43 was widespread across metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). The AMA study found that, at the 44 MSA level in 2021, at least one insurer had a market share of 30 percent in 98 percent of exchange 45 markets; in 73 percent of markets, one insurer had a market share of 50 percent; and in 39 perc ent 46 of markets, an insurer had a market share of 70 percent.9 Turning to the national level, Anthem had 47 the largest share of the exchange market in 2014 and 2015 but fell to sixth largest in 2021 while 48 Centene, which had a smaller share of the exchange market in earlier years, had the largest market 49 share (15 percent) in 2021.10 50 CMS Rep. 06-A-23 -- page 3 of 9 Concerns over the years regarding insufficient competition in the individual health care 1 marketplace have led some thought leaders, as well as state and federal policy makers, to p ut 2 forward a range of proposals to ensure marketplace coverage options, including the creation of a 3 public option. Concerns with public option proposals have previously been addressed at length by 4 the Council on Medical Service in Council Report 3 -A-18 and Council Report 1-Nov.-20 . Policy 5 experts have also suggested leveraging Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) 6 health plan partici pation as a solution to prevent bare counties in the marketplaces, which is 7 consistent with Policy H-165.825. In addition to discussing a public option and establishing policy 8 that supports requiring the largest two FEHBP insurers in counties that lack a m arketplace plan to 9 offer at least one silver -level marketplace plan as a condition of FEHBP participation, Policy 10 H-165.825\u2014established via Council on Medical Service Report 3-A-18 \u2014supports health plans 11 offering coverage options for individuals and small groups competing on a level playing field, 12 including providing coverage for pre-existing conditions and essential health benefits. This policy 13 also opposes the sale of health insurance plans in the individual and small group markets that do 14 not guarantee: (a) pre-existing condition protections and (b) coverage of essential health benefits 15 and their associated protections against annual and lifetime limits, and out -of-pocket expenses, 16 except in the limited circumstance of short- term limited -duration insurance offered for no more 17 than three months . 18 19 A primary purpose of regulations governing the health insurance marketplace has been to help 20 ensure that insurers are competing and operating on an even playing field in which all insurers and 21 plans must play by the same rules. The AMA advocates that exchanges need to offer choices to 22 patients to spur competition and that mechanisms to facilitate competition in health insurance 23 should ensure that critical patient protections remain in place, including the ban on pre-existing 24 condition exclusions as well as critical cost protections guaranteed in the ACA (e.g., annual cap on 25 out-of- pocket expenses). The AMA st rongly believes that an important federal role remains to 26 ensure that proposals to foster competition in health insurance also promote ACA marketplace 27 stability and a balanced risk pool and do not lead to adverse selection in the marketplace.11 28 29 NETWORK ADEQUACY 30 31 AMA policy and advocacy also underscores that a plan's provider network is an important factor in 32 maintaining healthy competition and choice and, as such, the AMA consistently advocates for 33 stronger network adequacy standards for QHPs, including those offered through federally 34 facilitated exchanges. The AMA believes that state regulators should have flexibility to regulate 35 their provider networks but also maintains that there is a critical need for a minimum federal 36 network adequacy standard that includes quantifiable standards, especially in light of inaction in 37 many states to update network adequacy requirements. The AMA has also advocated that CMS 38 implement additional qualitative standards to measure network adequacy and better evaluate access 39 to timely and appropriate care for enrollees in QHP plans. 12 40 41 In response to CMS' proposed rulemaking on benefits and payment parameters under the ACA for 42 2024, the AMA strongly supported CMS' inclusion of wait time requirements into the 43 measurement of network adequacy. The AMA believes this, and other quantitative standards are 44 critical to determining if a network can serve the needs of its enrollees. Often network physicians 45 may appear to be available but may not be accepting new patient s at all or have a lengthy wait time 46 for obtaining an appointment that makes it impossible to see them in a timely manner. Wait time 47 requirements could help address these issues. The AMA also urged CMS to consider additional 48 tools to measure compliance bey ond insurer attestation, including audits, secret shopper programs, 49 and patient surveys. 13 50 CMS Rep. 06- A-23 -- page 4 of 9 SALE OF HEALTH INSURANCE ACROSS STATE LINES 1 2 The issue of permitting the sale of health insurance across state lines has been debated by the 3 House of Delegates seve ral times over the years, with proponents arguing that this would spur 4 competition, choice, and affordability and others maintaining that any such allowances could 5 motivate insurers to incorporate in states with less insurance regulation, putting important patient 6 and provider protections at risk. Under AMA Policy H -180.946, established in 2017, the AMA 7 would support the sale of health insurance across state lines, including multistate compacts, when 8 patient and provider protection laws are consistent with and enforceable under the laws of the state 9 in which the patient resides. These protections include not weakening any state's laws or 10 regulations involving network adequacy and transparency; fair contracting and claims handling; 11 prompt payment for physicia ns; regulation of unfair health insurance market products and 12 activities; rating and underwriting rules; grievance and appeals procedures; and fraud. The 13 sentiment of AMA policy is that patients purchasing an out -of-state policy should retain the right to 14 bring a claim against an insurer in a state court in the state in which the patient resides. 15 16 Because a state's insurance regulator cannot enforce another state's laws or regulate beyond its 17 borders, consumer protections and other regulations must be clea rly defined when interstate health 18 insurance sales are permitted. It is unclear whether insurers would even be interested in selling 19 products in new markets across state lines where other carriers are already competing. When 20 interstate health insurance sal es were debated at the federal level in 2017, a handful of states had 21 laws allowing such sales; however, out -of-state issuers were not drawn to these markets, primarily 22 due to the costs and other challenges associated with developing provider networks in a nother state. 23 Some stakeholders, including the American Academy of Actuaries and the National Association of 24 Insurance Commissioners, have cautioned that interstate sales will neither increase competition nor 25 decrease premium pricing but could have unintended consequences related to consumer protections 26 and adverse selection.14 27 28 ADDITIONAL POLICIES IMPACTING THE MARKETPLACE IN 2023 29 30 Extension of Enhanced Premium Tax Credit Subsidies : The Inflation Reduction Act, signed into 31 law in August 2022, extends thro ugh 2025 the enhanced premium tax credits that were made 32 available to eligible consumers under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. T his advanceable 33 and refundable credit, which the AMA supports, reduces the premium contribution for families 34 with incomes between 100 and 150 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) to zero and provides 35 subsidies to 90 percent of consumers selecting marketplace plans. Partly as a result, enrollment in 36 marketplace plans has reached record highs, surpassing 16 million during the open enrollment 37 period that ran until mid- January 2023 for most exchanges.15 Additionally, the enhanced subsidies 38 significantly increase affordability of marketplace plans and will improve the stability of the 39 exchange market if healthier people enroll.16 40 41 Special Enrollment Opportunity (SEP) for Consumers Losing Medicaid/CHIP Coverage: The 42 Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 decoupled the Medicaid continu ous enrollment 43 requirement from the public health emergency (PHE) end date and permitted state eligibility 44 redeterminations of Medicaid/CHIP enrollees to begin as early as March 2023. Although it is not 45 yet known how many individuals will be disenrolled as states undertake these mass 46 redeterminations, major disruptions in coverage are anticipated and many people could become 47 uninsured. Importantly, CMS established a SEP for consumers losing Medicaid/CHIP coverage due 48 to the unwinding of the continuous enrollment requirement. This SEP, which allows individuals 49 and families to enroll in marketpl ace plans, if eligible, outside of the annual open enrollment 50 period, runs between March 31, 2023 and July 31, 2024 and presents a significant enrollment 51 CMS Rep. 06-A-23 -- page 5 of 9 opportunity for the exchanges.17 The Council addressed the mass redeterminations and strategies 1 for preventing coverage losses in Council Report 03-A-22 . 2 3 Fixing the \"Family Glitch:\" The AMA long supported fixing the \"family glitch\" and was 4 accomplished this year by regulations allow ing family members of workers offered affordable self- 5 only coverage to gain access to subsidized ACA marketplace coverage. Under the new rule, it was 6 anticipated that nearly one million Americans would see their coverage become more affordable.18 7 8 Requiring Standardized Plan Options : To address \"choice overload\" and increase transparency, in 9 2023, CMS began requiring issuers offering QHPs on HealthCare.gov to offer standard ized benefit 10 plans for every product, metal level, and geographic area. In comment letters to CMS, the AMA 11 has supported this change which will help highlight clear and meaningful differences between 12 plans, simplify consumer choice, and improve the plan se lection process. 19 13 14 AMA POLICY 15 16 As previously noted, Council on Medical Service Report 3-A-18 established Policy H-165.825, 17 which added to the AMA's strong body of policy on marketplace competition and health plan 18 choice. Policy H-165.839 outlines principles for the operation of health insurance exchanges, 19 including that: health insurance exchanges should maximize health plan choice for individuals and 20 families purchasing coverage; health plans participating in the exchange should provide an array of 21 choices, in terms of benefits covered, cost -sharing levels, and other features; and federal authority 22 or oversight of health insurance exchanges must respect the role of state insurance commissioners 23 with regard to ensuring protections for patients and physicians. Additionally, this policy supports 24 using the open marketplace model for any health insurance exchange to increase competition and 25 maximize patient choice of health plans. 26 27 Policy H- 165.838 supports health reform initiatives that are consistent with long-standing AMA 28 policies on pluralism, freedom of choice, freedom of practice, and universal access for patients. 29 This policy also states that insurance coverage options offered in a health insurance exchange be 30 self-supporting; have uniform solvency requirements; not receive special advantages from 31 government subsidies; include payment rates established through meaningful negotiations and 32 contracts; not require provider participation; and not restrict enrollees' access to out-of-network 33 physicians. Support for fixing the ACA's \"family glitch\" is addressed by Policy H-165.828, which 34 also supports efforts to ensure clear and meaningful differences between plans offered on health 35 insurance exchanges. 36 37 Principles to guide in the evaluation of the adequacy of health insurance coverage options are 38 outlined in Policy H- 165.846, including that: any insurance pool or similar structure designed to 39 enable access to age- appropriate health insurance coverage must include a wide variety of coverage 40 options from whic h to choose; existing federal guidelines regarding types of health insurance 41 coverage should be used as a reference when considering if a given plan would provide meaningful 42 coverage; and mechanisms must be in place to educate patients and assist them in m aking informed 43 choices. This policy also opposes waivers of essential health benefits (EHB) requirements that lead 44 to the elimination of EHB categories and their associated protections. Policy H- 165.865 states that 45 in order to qualify for a tax credit for the purchase of individual health insurance, the health 46 insurance purchased must provide coverage for hospital care, surgical and medical care, and 47 catastrophic coverage of medical expenses as defined by Title 26 Section 9832 of the U.S. Code. 48 49 Network ade quacy is addressed in Policy H -285.908, which supports state regulators as the primary 50 enforcer of network adequacy requirements. This policy supports requiring health insurers to 51 CMS Rep. 06-A-23 -- page 6 of 9 submit and make publicly available, at least quarterly, reports to state reg ulators that provide data 1 on several measures of network adequacy. Policy H- 180.946 supports the selling of insurance 2 across state lines that ensure that certain patient and provider protection laws are consistent with 3 and enforceable under the laws of the state in which the patient resides. Additionally, Policy 4 H-180.946 states that patients purchasing an out-of-state policy should retain the right to bring a 5 claim in a state court in the state in which the patient resides. 6 7 Policy H- 165.856 supports greater national uniformity of market regulation across health insurance 8 markets, geographic location, or type of health plan. Under this policy, state variation in market 9 regulation is permissible so long as states demonstrate that departures from national regulations 10 would not drive up the number of uninsured, and so long as variations do not hamper the 11 development of multi -state group purchasing alliances or create adverse selection. Under Policy 12 D-165.971, the AMA will support an association health plan t hat safeguards state and federal 13 patient protection laws, including those state regulations regarding fiscal soundness and prompt 14 payment. Policy D -180.986 encourages local, state, and federal regulatory authorities to 15 aggressively pursue action against \"s ham\" health insurers. 16 17 Policy H- 180.947 opposes consolidation in the health insurance industry that may result in 18 anticompetitive markets. Antitrust reform is an AMA priority under Policy D -383.990, which 19 directs the AMA to continue to: aggressively advocate for a level playing field for negotiations 20 between physicians and health insurers; advocate to the Federal Trade Commission and 21 Department of Justice for more flexible and fair treatment of physicians and for greater scrutiny for 22 insurers; continue to d evelop and publish objective evidence of the dominance of health insurers 23 through its study, Competition in Health Insurance; and identify consequences of the concentration 24 of market power by health plans. 25 26 DISCUSSION 27 28 Insurer participation in the ACA marketplace has increased for five consecutive years, although a 29 smaller increase was seen in 2023. Additionally, record numbers of individuals have signed up for 30 coverage in the exchanges, which seem to be functioning well . Enrollment is likely being 31 influenced this year by 1) the Inflation Reduction Act's extension of enhanced premium tax credit 32 subsidies for marketplace plans, through 2025, and 2) the disenrollment of individuals no longer 33 eligible for Medicaid/CHIP, some of whom may be eligible for subsidized ACA plans. Still, the 34 Council recognizes that insurer participation in the marketplace remains lower today than in 2015, 35 when it was at its highest, and the share of plans offered by large insurers has been steadily 36 growing in recent years . Additionally, many insurer exchange markets remain highly concentrated, 37 as evidenced by data compiled in the AMA's most recent edition of Competition in Health 38 Insurance: A Comprehensive Study of U.S. Markets . Importantly, health i nsurance markets are 39 local; across states, there is significant variation in the number of insurers and plans offered in 40 ACA exchanges and, within states, there may be differences in insurer participation in rural and 41 urban regions. The Council shares the sentiment of many physicians that insufficient competition 42 in the ACA marketplace remains concerning in many areas. 43 44 The Council also recognizes that the AMA has been a longstanding advocate for health insurance 45 coverage for all Americans, as well as pluralism, freedom of choice, freedom of practice and 46 universal access for patients. The AMA's plan to cover the uninsured , updated annually with new 47 policy and metrics on the uninsured, lays out key calls for action to not only maintain, but build 48 upon, the coverage gains that have been achieved under the ACA. This plan guides ongoing AMA 49 federal and state advocacy on health reform polic y priorities. Importantly, i ncreasing insurer 50 competition , maximizing health plan choice, and strengthening and ensuring the sustainability of 51 CMS Rep. 06-A-23 -- page 7 of 9 the ACA marketplace remain key AMA priorities. The Council has presented several reports in 1 recent years to estab lish and update AMA policy on these issues, including: 2 3 Council on Medical Service Report 4-I-17 , Health Insurance Affordability: Essential 4 Health Benefits and Subsidizing the Coverage of High- Risk Patients ; 5 Council on Medical Service Report 3-A-18 , Ensuring Marketplace Competition and Health 6 Plan Choice ; 7 Council on Medical Service Report 2-A-18 , Improving Affordability in the Health 8 Insurance Exchanges ; 9 Council on Medical Service Report 2-A-19 , Covering the Uninsured under the AMA 10 Proposal for Reform ; 11 Council on Medical Service Report 1-Nov.-20 , Options to Maximize Coverage under the 12 AMA Proposal for Reform ; and 13 Council on Medical Service Report 3-Nov.-21 , Covering the Remaining Uninsured. 14 15 Additionally, the Council highlights the following AMA policies addressing the issues raised in 16 Policy D-165.933 and exemplifying the AMA's strong support for insurer competition and health 17 plan choice: 18 19 Policy H-165.825, which offers solutions to ensuring marketplace competition and health 20 plan choice; 21 Policy H- 165.839, which supports using the open marketplace model for any health 22 insurance exchange and states that exchanges should maximize health plan choice; 23 Policy H-165.838, under which insurance coverage options offered in an exchange should 24 be self -supporting and have uniform solvency and other requirements; 25 Policy H-165.846, which outlines principles to guide in the evaluation of health insurance 26 coverage options; 27 Policy H- 180.946, which supports the selling of insurance across state lines, including 28 multistate compacts, when patient and p rovider protection laws are consistent with and 29 enforceable under the laws of the state in which the patient resides; 30 Policy H-165.856, which supports greater uniformity of market regulation across health 31 insurance markets, geographic location, or type of health plan; and 32 Policy H-180.947, which opposes consolidation in the health insurance industry that may 33 result in anticompetitive markets. 34 35 CONCLUSION 36 37 During the development of this report, the Council did not identify gaps in existing AMA policy on 38 comp etition and choice and, therefore, makes no policy recommendations at this time. However, 39 the Council believes network adequacy, which is key to maintaining healthy competition and 40 choice i n the exchanges, is an issue that remains problematic and is worthy of additional study. 41 Relatedly, the Council is concerned about the ability of patients to see certain physicians who are 42 listed by plans as in -network but for whom, in reality, access is limited. Accordingly, the Council 43 has begun looking at the need for stronger network adequacy standards for ACA, Medicare 44 Advantage, and Medicaid plans and will present a report on this topic at the 2023 Interim Meeting. 45 CMS Rep. 06-A-23 -- page 8 of 9 REFERENCES 1 Dafny L, Gruber J, Ody C.
