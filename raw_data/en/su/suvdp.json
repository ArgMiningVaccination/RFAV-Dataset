They can exist anywhere, whether it be land, sea, air, or even space or toxic or spatial environments. Animals are sentient, semi-sentient, or non-sentient, and sentient beings are more common than normal here, and are not technically classified as aliens. (Currently under revamping for an easier time finding creatures here.) Evolution[ ] Life in the AUU evolved differently from the OUU because of always interacting with each other since the beginning when the Evolution Masters of the [Gods of the Alternate UUniverses](/wiki/Gods_of_the_Alternate_UUniverses) were growing to council it with their ability to warp genetic code. Though the commonality of OUU life would form, other groups occurred. This is because of the conditions of different planets, their location in the system, and the stars themselves. Biota that was not the traditional physiology of life would often be dubbed 'xenimals', or 'xeno-animals'. The biota would be categorized based on planetary conditions. This would be classified in 4 types: Star-Type (ST), Gravity-Type (GT), Distance-Type (DT), and Atmosphere-Type (AT). Star-Type would classify what kind of star the creature can thrive in based both on spectrum and magnitude. Based around the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (Starzsprung diagram in AUU terms), the spectrum measures the type of sunlight and radiation of a star, and the magnitude measures the size of the star. Brighter stars make flora brighter while dimmer stars make plants darker. | | Spectrum: | | Magnitude: Gravity-Type would classify what kind of gravity the creature can thrive in. Creatures that live in different kinds of gravity often require stronger or weaker means of movement, and flight is differential to the kind of gravity of a planet. - T0-Type: T0-Type Organisms are biota that can live on bigger and heavier celestial objects like gas or ice giants, brown dwarfs, and even stars. These celestial objects can carry crucial building blocks for life, and could provide habitability via temperatures and pressures. - T1-Type: T1-Type Organisms are biota that can live on Tier 1 planets, which are the biggest planets and therefore have the strongest gravity and thickest atmospheres. Creatures on these planets are usually stronger with large bones and larger muscle mass, shorter to avoid the risk of falling under the strong gravity, and have legs that are usually close to the ground to lessen balance. They'll also have a more robust circulatory system. To avoid the push of gravity, they can also live predominantly underwater. Flora would be stunted by the energy cost of carrying nutrients on this type of planet. - T2-Type: T2-Type Organisms are biota that can live on Teadr 2 planets, or Super-Earths/Super-Marbons, with gravity usually multiplied. Creatures on these planets are usually in between the physiology of alien and earthly. They can also have more life underwater than on land, but more so than on an Earth/Marbon planet. Here, the effects of a Teadr 1 planet on fauna and flora are lessened, but not uncommon. - T3-Type: T3-Type Organisms are biota that can live on Tier 3 planets like Earth/Marbon. Thus animals are in the average category. - T4-Type: T4-Type Organisms are biota that can live on Tier 4 planets, which are the smallest planets and therefore have the weakest gravity and thinnest atmospheres, but could lose atmospheres and lack a magnetic field to protect against cosmic rays. Creatures on these planets are usually weaker, taller, can fly easier, and are built very fragile. This could allow life to thrive more on land than in the water. But they can also be predominantly subterranean should the magnetosphere be weaker and cosmic rays more lethal. Flora can grow taller due to higher energy intake, and the lesser gravity could make animal anatomy more diverse and alien-like from lighter weight and mass. - T5-Type: T5-Type Organisms are biota that can live outside of a planet and in the cold and unforgiving vacuum of space. This is commonly called 'astrobiota', and the lack of gravity or weight can allow for an unlimited amount of physiology and anatomy for life itself. Distance-Type would classify what distance from the star the creature can thrive in. Planets too close are too hot, while planets too far are too cold, and thus planets the most likely to house life are housed in the habitable zone. - Hot-Type: Hot-Type Organisms are biota that can live on planets too close to the stars they orbit. Cold-blooded creatures are the most likely to thrive on these planets. - Average-Type: Average-Type Organisms are biota that can live on planets within the habitable zone. - Cold-Type: Cold-Type Organisms are biota that can live on planets too far the stars they orbit. Warm-blooded animals are the most likely to thrive on these planets. Atmosphere-Type would classify what kind of atmospheric conditions the creature can thrive in. Different atmospheric conditions can alter the biological needs of the planet's biota, usually deviating from the average Earth atmosphere. These creatures breath different kinds of air, require no respiration, need more or less respiration, and so on. - Type I: Type I Organisms are biota that can live on Type I planets and require normal respiration like oxygen and carbon dioxide. This is the base type of Earth/Marbon life. - Type II: Type II Organisms are biota that can live on Type II planets and require a half-oxygen respiration, as well as an alternate kind of element. - Type III: Type III Organisms are biota that can live on Type III planets and thus oxygen is poisonous to them. They have a different kind of respiration as a result. - Type IV: Type IV Organisms are biota that can live on Type IV planets and therefore don't require atmosphere or respiration, capable of even living in a vacuum. Mammals[ ] Land Mammals[ ] Rodents[ ] Rodents in the AUU are noted for being just like our own, but their teeth are made entirely of regenerative calcium and can regenerate.

They are the Alternate version of wolves which are capable of hunting in packs of 8-40. They have stronger senses than wolves. Their domestication with the AUU humans lead them to evolving into the Rog, the alternate version of dogs. - Rog- The alternate version of dogs. Like dogs, they evolved into breeds. There are over 302 breeds of Rog known to the AUU.

They are covered in a chriselised fur that allows them to thrive best in extremely cold planets. These creatures would've suffered a serious hunting issue if the christail fur wasn't rendered useless for profit as pretty much normal water ice. They are also used as the greatest pets for those of the cold planets given their knack to hunt for salt and sometimes being able to dig up lightly more valuable reshorces in digging for salt. Their skelital structure is very flexable, allowing the canines to form chrsitailene balls like hedgehogs and either roll to safety down a hill or basicly become an inpentritable ball of cristails that, while not deadly sharp, they do then to prick painfully to sensitive areas. Alone, A Xultice will always get into a ball for defence, but in packs, Xultices can be very aggressive against predators or intruders unless you can get their trust, and given that they like salt, I wouldn't call it a daunting challnage. - Xomot- A burrowing fox-like slender wolf with a yellow coloration, an omnivorous diet, and a curious reputation. They hang out in desert habitats. - Xammoge- Predatory nocturnal jackal-like animals that hunt in packs with two sets of eyes: two large yellow ones in the front similar to the eyes of an owl which are used to see normally, and two small blue ones in the back that allow it to see in the darker regions through infrared vision, seeing the heat signatures of it's prey or anything around them. - Zaldon- A canine similar to the Short-eared dog.

Being as feral and very different to their urban descendant as a dingo to a dog, these felines have grown out of sentient activity, they will have ranged reactions to confronting them. Like the feloot, they come in different breeds, and have a similar appearance, except with different wild-oriented changes. - Felinel- A feline and a missing link to felines and mustelids as, in the AUU, the two are closer in the evolutionary chain than in the OUU. They are a vastly alternate branch of the Feloot family that, though more weasel like in appearance, still retain some (if not all) cat traits. They are as agile as the feloot's masterful skills, if not made better with their thinner structure, come in 22 species across the AUU, and are mostly found in alleys and the wild than as pets. - Feze- A semi-arboreal predatory feline that commonly eats prosimian primates, filling the niche of fossa.

It is a deadly predator native to Keyti Prime that has adapted to environments and stayed out of extinction and remained 75% stagnant in evolution since it actually came into existence 99 million years ago. If not put in an environment with large amounts of population control, it can cause damage to the environment itself and it has caused hundreds of extinctions. It cannot be tamed by even the best of animal whisperers as it is far too aggressive. It killed sentient beings and took on loads of competitive predators. - Galeyon- A large felinoid which looks like a blend between a wolf, bear, and a saber-toothed tiger, possessing a wolverine-like bulky body, a short tail, and sabre-like incisors.

They are omnivorous, and are skilled and intelligent hunters. - Zlash- A large leopard/jaguar-patterned saber-toothed cat that is bigger than the average Smilodon. They can blend into their surroundings perfectly, and deliver fatal blows with both their retractable claws and their teeth. They can intimidate easy with their alien-like eyes, and their leopard-like coloration is much more intensely-detailed. However, in Gree, the Zlashes native there once had a major reproductive problem that caused them to have more then a protortionate amount of cubs. The population in the planet was at first met with conventional hunting, but when it only made little dents and only resulted with angry Zlashes, the better alternative lead to simply having them be exposed to a gene serum that gets their reproductives to make a more normalised amount and put the population in balence. UIS[ ] A B C - Chromon- A bizarre lion-panther that has frilled manes all over it's body, lion-fish-like frills on it's head that rattle, and are known to blend well within the most complex of alien jungles.

They evolved two brains, the seecond one inside another central skull in their ribcage, which is meant for increased motor function and cognition, they evolved a semi-warm-blooded nature, they learned to evolve both feathers and fur, and they have greater intelligence since their second brains help offer more room for such. USRA[ ] - Arctossole- A very large segnosaur with claws that are long and flattened side-to-side, forming tools that they use to dig for food under the snow. When feeding, they lower their heads to the ground, its spine nearly horizontal, while their claws plow through the snow. It's long, hollow, hair-like plumage covers almost all parts of its body, including the toes. They are now in something of a decline, as their home planets' tundras have receded, as they now live only in the rather narrow steppe belt around the tundras, and their extreme specialization to this habitat makes them very sensitive to environmental change. - Ansersaur- A conservative ornithoschian commonly found on large tropical lamdmasses across the AUU. They come in 6 species of small bipedal herbivores with no trace of a palpebral bone in their eyes which give them a comical 'beady-eyed' look, and a large crest on the top of it's snout formed from the nasal cavity and the top of the snout as the roof is formed entirely by the large premaxillary bones. - Alvas- An ostrich-like dinosaur similar to Struthiomimus.

They can be found just about anywhere where there are trees, roaming far and wide in search of fresh greenery leaving a trail of dung and destruction in their wake, providing opportunities for a host of other organisms. - Boofone- A large stegosaurid with a Spinosaurus-like back crest, a durable crested head, and takes the niche of rhinos among many worlds. - Carnosaurus Rex- A long descendant of dinosaurs similar to the T-Rex. It's teeth and jaws have evolved into a look similar to the jaws of a Dunkleosteus, teeth being completely made of bone. They have also evolved bigger arms for grabbing objects. They are found in mostly jungle environments. - Cheegion- A small theropod noted for having no arms, long thin legs, deadly bites that contain pain-inflicting poisons. They hunted in family groups and could run as fast as a cheetah. - Chetui- A spotted carnotaur-like theropod which has poisonous back spines, vestigial arms, and are very fast runners capable of hunting in packs. They are usually loners, but are sometimes known to cooperate with siblings or other closely related individuals. Despite this fact, a chetui will drive away or kill an unrelated individual if it catches one trespassing in its territory. - Carchasaur- A theropod dinosaur similar to Carcharodontosaurs, but being 10% bigger. Their noted for their opposable thumbs, their spiked backs, their bizarre teeth, their incredibly-built bodies, and their feathered bodies. - Cockot- A dromaeosaur related to the Drak, and appearing very similar, minus the Cockot's feathery bodies and rooster-like faces. They are pack hunters that hunt in groups of 8-13. - Cynoraptor- A species of raptor which are the size of wolves, but are equally as terrifying.

They are social creatures that live in groups and graze on high tree top leaves. - Chromhade- A hadrosaur known for it's dull-brown body, brown back hairs and a brown neck sac, a blue facial horn and purple structures on the snout. They came in herds of 19-37, and were very tough and hard-to-tackle targets for predators. - Crozzosaur- A hadrosaur closely related to the Spintosaur, except they don't have randomly-shaped crests, they have an orange and black-streaked coloration, a blue rear for attracting potential mates, and long straight tails with yellow-and-black-streaked crests on the tip. It moves about in tight herds often only seen as a bunch of tails waving above the long grasses. When a predator attacks, the herd breaks up in a confusing flurry of flags and poles, leaving the attacker bewildered. - Crownilope- An ungulasaur that has a frill-like crest on it's nostrils and frontal face, covered with spikes. This is useful for protecting it's face from attacks to the head, as well as wrestling for mates. They come in 22 different species across the AUU. - Critesen- A large hadrosaur that has spiny back crests, and are very powerful creatures that can push down a tree to reach for it's food, males having stripes on their heads while females just have one. They come in 61 different species across the AUU. - Ceratak- A small, gracile herbivorous hadrosaur that has ridged-grinding teeth and is widely spread across the AUU. Most of these species are obligate quadrupeds, but one or two smaller species spend much of their time on their hind legs. They can be found in forest environments in many regions in two different species. - Clubbord- An ankylosaur that has roof-spined edges on their tails, spiny plated backs, club-like tails, rough skin, multiple horns on it's head, and is very aggressive, known to injure other males and even willingly kill them just to get a mate. - Crackerbeak- An arboreal hypsilophodont that evolved specialized perching feet. They use their colorful beaks for cracking seeds and fruit, and in the males, the beak has a small crest on top of it for attracting mates. - Collosisaurus- Giantic rock-covered creatures from the Citi System big enough to hold ecosystems and even primitive Citimite civilisations on their backs. They can live for a long time and have an organ system that allows them to survive without food or water for a long time, which is very helpful in their mostly rocky/desert planet. When they do need to eat, they mainly aim for rocks and other stones due to a unigte dietary system given the current environment. - Cristsaur- A theropod with colorful necks and heads, and two small head crests. - Dominox- A giant theropod that is the AUU's second-rating superpredator. It is a giant predator that stands over 25ft tall, has small traces of fur, long muscular bodies, the ability to camouflage with a limited amount of color change, can mimic the sounds of other animals and thus communicate with them, has poisonous spines on it's back, long jagged-clawed arms, a long crested tail perfect for lashing at opponents, teeth that were pure bone and jaws that weren't attached to the skull and allowed for wider opening like a shark, could run at long distances, had small traces of armor, and could choose whether or not to hunt solitarily or in groups, being efficient either way. This was a superpredator native to an unknown world that was thought to evolve closely to the C-Rex until further examination lead to it being more related to a former extinct superpredator that was a very far evolutionary cousin to the C-Rex, as the two actually shared convergent evolution, Dominox evolving the same habits and physiology of C-Rex, and became better than it in every way. Because it is a superpredator, it could cause a lot of damage to most ecosystems it is introduced in as it needs one where it's population is controlled and it doesn't cause any extinctions like it has before. - Denblexosaur- A large sabre-toothed predatory dinosaur. These teeth are used to punch a large wound in it's prey, so severe it can die within 10 seconds. These teeth are also regenerative, breaking off once a year. - Dracerior- A dilophosaurid-like dinosaur and a relative of the Turretosaur which has bioluminescent neck frills for warning, and it has the ability to use an additional lung to store hydrogen as it consumes combustable metals to breath a long stream of fire that can spread 5 feet. - Dipiniton- a furry fish-eating mountain-dwelling coelurosaur with white fur for warmth, and long beak-like jaws filled with fine-pointed teeth. - Doiilsaur- A ornithomimid dinosaur noted for dwelling in wetlands.

Their charges can deal a huge amount of damage, and they easily fill the niche of rhino-like creatures on multiple dinosaur worlds. - Doracc- An ungulasaur noted for two-pronged horns, and grayish bodies with colorful bioluminescent speckles. They are the fastest and smallest of the ungulasaurs, and are known to attain speeds acomparable to those of the fastest of antelopes. They are mixed browser-grazers, and are notoriously skittish, and outrun partially all predators. - Duosaur- A relatively rare hadrosaur with found only in the arid grasslands of outback worlds. They are noted for two diagonally-straight horns that form a capital V-shape held aloft by powerful muslces anchored to enlarged neural spines over it's shoulder-blades and are used principally as sexual symbols or defense, and are grazers that have beaks which are blunt but not squared and are capable of cropping a wide range of vegetation. They are capable of tackling the toughest and most poisonous of grasses. - Dendcer- An arboreal long-legged hadrosaur that can be found in large jungles across the AUU, coming in 6 species. They have unique crenulated pads on their feet that are superficially similar to a remora's suction-disc, allowing them to tightly grasp onto vertical surfaces. Most have a large thumb-spike that can be used for defense or for puncturing and scrapping large fruits. - Dugagong- A bipedal semi-aquatic hadrosaur that can be found on AUU dinosaur worlds floating low upon coastal ocean swells, paddling around warm lagoons, or wading through freshwater streams. Some species tend to prefer the last of these niches, inhabiting such large and famous rivers across the AUU where they eat a variety of water plants and dam streams like beavers and excavate large shallow bogs to further the growth of their favorite foods. The marine species, though not as industrious as their freshwater relatives, range in size and fill the niche of walruses, penguins, and sometimes whales. - Drurdle- A rodent-sized ankylosaur that has red-brown plated scales and a small club that is only useful for stunning and agitating larger predators so it can scurry away. It is a scavenger that consumes the recently-deceased, though snacks on insects as well. - Dinchgo- A meter-long omnivorous predatory dinosaur that evolved from ornithopods and are noted for sexual dimorphism. Males are partially quadrupeds with a sail atop its back. The rays in this sail are tipped with venomous barbs, containing poisons from consumed desert plants.

Most species are quite large, and some have an omnivorous diet. - Eletopsert- A large ceratopsian 2x bigger than an average elephant, and takes the niche of said creature. Though a herbivore, it is a truly fearsome and ferociously territorial animal, and their bellicose tempers and extremely poor eyesight makes them liable to charge at any moving object in their vicinity. It is a difficult animal to study as any vehicle such as a jeep, hovercraft, or any on-foot passionate sentient being have been destroyed, partially or completely, and trampled by enraged bulls. Though they are only aggressive because they primarily have 10x more testosterone than an elephant, which was necessary for them to get enough adrenaline to defend themselves and fight unstoppably. They are specialist-browsers that can tear down anything in order to get to their favorite meals, which are full of testosterone and sugars that give them their destructive edge. Both sexes have curving jugal horns. Females use their slightly smaller horns for uprooting small trees and clearing paths through brush, but the males' tusks are more decorative in nature. In the mating season, males will butt their tusks against each other and push, demonstrating to watching females their strength and general health. The tusks are sharp, and may be used by either sex against attackers, but in mating battles between males, they are careful to avoid injuring either himself or his opponent. During most of the year, they will kill any large animal that gets near them, but in love, they are gentle beasts. - Eevu- A raptor that has a deepish gray blue body, glowing cyan eyes, hairy backs, and tranquilizing bite venom. - Elefrill- A raptor with neck frills that look like elephant ears and drooping crests, and can spit venom. - Fluck- An ornithomimid mostly-noted for it's red head, the males' bare and brightly-colored neck skin with a red wattle adding to the effect.

During the winter, they sleep in the small caves they dig in the snow, and even hibernate for several weeks if the weather becomes too harsh. - Hargack- A predatory dromaeosaur named after their harsh croaking calls that is very common all around many bog and country worlds across the AUU. They hunt small mammals and often use their long forelimbs to dig them out from their holes. They also catch small birds and scavenge. They live in very loose packs with each individual protecting it's own territory, but when a large food resource is located, the individual that found the food will call the others to feed after it has finished eating. - Hormmon- A hadrosaur in the ungulasaur order, having toes on their frontal legs, and hooved back legs, a patterned body, and ungulate-like antlers (males' like a reindeer's, and females' much smaller). It lives in large herds, usually of around 30-50 individuals but occasionally up to 200. Old males tend to be solitary. It feeds on leaves and tender branches and sometimes digging for tubers. - Hexagisaur- A hadrosaur in the ungulasaur order, and is best noted for it's 6 straight horns, 3 on each side of the head, whereas the males have longer horns than the females.

They are commonly found in saltwater estuaries of tropical lands. During the night, they paddle into the deep ocean presumably to feed on the nutrient-rich kelp and surface feeding cnidarians. They stabilize themselves on the surface by inflating and deflating their lungs, helping them stay afloat. Towards the morning, they swim back to shore since this is the time when the oceanic predators are active. Since their armor plating old covers their dorsal regions, their undersides are quite vulnerable to attack. They are often followed by an armada of fish, some parasitic, some valuable, and still others seeking protection. - Mractor- Armless featherless raptors that, while having no eyes, can use their sonic screams as echolocation, as well as use it for hunting. - Notster- An ostritch-like ornithomimid that is a fairly widespread apex herbivore on multiple savanna and jungle worlds across the AUU. - Ninjysaur- A dromaeosaur that is found on large tropical islands all across the AUU.

The males are much bigger than the females, and have blue wings with 3 structures on the bottom, the central ones being the longest, while the females have green wings and smaller structures. The caterpillars are capable of releasing their hemotoxic venom as a projectile. They metamorphosize differently than butterflies. They go underwater and transform into a fish-like caterpillar predator that consumes small fish that contain the fatty acids that it needs to develop quickly, this phase being called a nymph, and after consuming enough food, they become an underwater stalk with the cocoon on the tip that pokes above the surface. After 7 months, they complete their growth cycle as a butterfly-like form. They retain their hemotoxin within their bite. - Angelfly- A dragonfly-like insect that has transparent wings that look like a bird's wings.

They are often hostile, and will attack anything that it sees when it deems it food. They live in deserts and are capable of spraying acid at prey. - Composomite- A spider-like eusocial insect that is famous around the AUU for being an invasive species that has a semi-sentient intelligence as the byproduct of their feeding on animal carcasses preserves a partial amount of organic material into an inedible soil-like substance that can hold a fair amount of life, as these creatures consume not the meat, but all liquids and fluids within even the cells, making the remaining organic material inedible to even decomposers, and making the carcass a decorative part of the environment, creating what is called 'orgaliths'. These insects have 10 spider-like legs, four of them with opposable crafting fingers and the other 6 being walker-like legs, 2 long spine-like tails on their rears, reproduce nearly half their lifetimes, are adaptable creatures, and despite having a lifespan of only 6 years, they can do their work almost every day. - Carxert- A cricket-like insect that harvests meat and either eats it, or stores enough for the winter. The bigger species will attack anything small enough that wanders into it's territory, killing it with it's multi-clawed forelegs and it's razor-sharp mandibles. - Cigapod- A walking stick that looks similar to a cigarette. They evolved on ecumenopolis worlds, and while the birds that ate it learned to not eat cigarettes on the ground that could easily kill them, they took advantage of that knowledge and camouflage themselves as a cigarette. They even release a smoke-smelling toxin that simulates the poisons, driving away the predator. - Cumberfly- A large four-winged horsefly that is a liquivorous hunter that flies with large golden wings, a poisonous bite filled with red venom, a proboscis tongue, and an instinct of choosing whether or not to hunt in groups or on one's self. - Carnopteran- A giant liquivorous hunting wasp that grew so big after originating from a world of high oxygen, and evolved makeshift lungs to stay in that size and take on larger prey. It is a highly-adapted predator that uses large compound eyes to detect prey in jungles and it's common urban ruin climate. When it has found suitable prey, it will use it's large translucent golden flaring wings, it's strong mantis like legs, and it's natural speed to catch birds or other giant animals while the razor sharp mandibles packing deadly paralyzing venom and poisonous stinger make short work of the meal. - Centew- A centipede that has a long back tail with a pincer of small poisonous barbs, can live in both land and sea depending upon the species, and comes in over 500 different species across the AUU. - Dingle- A eusocial dung beetle that has a jeweled beetle-like back, two rhino beetle horns, and are renowned as being able to make a grand amount of fertilizer types and have even farmed their own crops inside nests. - Drosoph- A small flea-like fruit-fly that is parasitic, and feeds off of blood. - Dracthonfly- A large griffinfly-like bug that thrives in worlds of high oxygen concentration.

They come in 51 different species across the AUU, and is commonly found in jungles and rainforests. - Gladiofly- A large hunting wasp that is as aggressive and powerful as the inferxasp, and has a similar red-and-gold coloration. But many differences include it's 4 translucent golden wings, it's middle legs that can spear anything it darts after, large toothed chelicerae that can butcher it's prey, and it's venom is worth an entire inferxasp swarm's stings combined into one and causes the worst agonizing pain in whatever it stings, as it kills the smallest of it's prey in an instant, and causes days of agonizing pain in anything bigger than itself. They are capable of eating rodents, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and even other bugs, and are often cannibalistic on each other. When competing for mates, the loser is eaten by the victor. Then after giving birth, the female eats it's mate, and creates up to 6 nests in the ground to raise a single maggot that is just as big as the smaller males, as it keeps the individuals in separate nests because the maggots are cannibalistic to even their own siblings. - Grasstone- A mantis-like creature with grasshopper-like legs, large wings, and are creatures considered of good luck in various worlds across the AUU, coming in over a thousand species. - Hextramite- A species of 6-limbed sapient insectoids which are noted for their 4 green eyes, their primate-like agility, their complex dexterity, their sticky webbing, and their poisonous bites. - Hobofly- A stonefly-like creature which is named after both it's solitary nature and their ability to go on for months without food.

Their stingers deliver venom that can cause burning pain. One individual sting is not enough to kill, but an entire swarm is capable of killing over a hundred sentient beings. - Krunxa- A small ant-like insect with 8 legs, and highly-advanced castes. They have an irrigation system, and in some species, have venom. However this venom doesn't protect them from the hungry pangaloons that prey on them. - Kleptofly- A wasp-like robberfly which is known for getting onto spider-webs and stealing prey without getting stuck itself.

They are extreme survivors that have been around for 660 million years in the AUU, and have evolved into many dangerous forms, most of them becoming extinct over time, and come in over a thousand species all over the AUU. They are extreme survivors because it was said that they possessed genetic anomalies that allowed them to adapt, but by modern times, they lost this ability, thus this loss more or less played a role in the history of genetic regression serums used to eliminate genetic anomalies in sentient beings. These insects nourishes themselves very easily and can survive for years without food as long as they have water, they can survive without a head for a month, they can regrow severed appendages, and they can survive any number of radiation, and more-impressively, harnessed such a thing during it's genetic-anomaly era, granting certain species abilities such as bioluminescence, chemical weapons, and various others. They can commonly occur red, gold, brown, and gasoline-colored across the AUU, yet other colors are apparent. - Qoqqle- A wasp-like insect that is a predatory venomous hunting wasp that has golden glittering wings, has an armosis chemical weapon that strikes with the force of a sniper bullet in bug scales, has multiple nests, has a bioluminescent fire-colored abdomen that warns larger predators that it's poisonous to consume, and it has 6 wings. - Rhzonae- A rhino-beetle-like beetle with black and dark blue coloration.

They attract mates through an inflatable pouch throat and a mating dance. They commonly eat a red spotted plum called a Lyfoul Plum, which is poisonous to sentient beings and spread it's seeds through defecation. - Lior- A relative of duck-like birds with bright-pink splayed limbs, long slender necks and bold colorations. It combines the long legs of a runner with a duck's waddling gait. Forming flocks of up to 30 birds in lowland woods and grasslands, they feed on a wide range of vegetation, and are sexually-dimorphic as the males possess more ornate head crests and bright yellow ceres, and attract mates through dance. These birds are polygamous breeders. When pursued, they simply pick up the pace of their usual \"silly walking\", all while this activity is accompanied by the birds' loud, whooping alarm call, effectively avoiding any predator or sentient being. - Marab- A flightless relative of buzzard-like birds that has blackish-gray feathers, red-and-yellow (male) and purple (female) bald heads and necks, and still retain a scavenging lifestyle.

They appear with small wings, brown-gray feathered bodies, dull-orange legs and beaks, and red heads. They come in 5 different breeds that have different diets, which they can be carnivorous, herbivorous, omnivorous, liquivorous, or insectivorous. Growing primarily on islands without predators have left them to grow tame and fearless, thus leaving them easily vulnerable to predators. Now this is a rare creature as a result of sentient being activity, either by hunting or accidentally introducing predators. Once thought to be extinct, it was discovered, breeds and otherwise, barely alive, and thus the only remnants of this species are in repopulation centers, and the only remnants of them in the wild are in reserve islands free of and/or protected by predators and poachers. - Shootsh- A flightless bird evolving from cassowary-like birds, having a blue head and neck, and gray and white bodies, dark-gray legs, a pink beak, and small wings.

Q R S T U V W X Y Z Fish[ ] Saltwater Fish[ ] Fish all over the AUU, unlike OUU fish, are capable of living in both freshwater and saltwater, because climate change being more frequent allowed them to develop salt bladders, which allow them to control their salt intake in case of climate change, as well as developing their gills to get mini epiglottises when they get stranded on land, and allow their lungs to breath traditionally, and their graphene-like skin allows them to keep in moisture. So saltwater fish in the AUU are categorized by their environmental preference, only going to freshwater to migrate or adapt. Jawless Fish/Armored Fish/Cartilaginous Fish[ ] Agnathans, placoderms, and chondrichthyens as they have mostly cartilaginous skeletons, though jawless fish have a tube-like skeleton with a spine, ribs, and a cartilaginous sac surrounding it, armored fish' skeletons were half-exoskeletal as their outer bodies had the only bones that make their armor while their internal skeleton was 50% cartilaginous, and cartilaginous fish evolved to have 100% cartilaginous skeletons that got harder the longer they lived and grow traditional bones.

Q R S T U V W X Y Z UIS[ ] A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z Cnidarians[ ] Cnidarians, like many invertebrates in the AUU, are capable of living just as numerously on land as in the sea. They did this by evolving to rely mostly upon the same food as plants, but they still require more water than plants thanks to their more-aquatic heritage. This is why they are mostly found in humid landscapes like coasts or high-weather areas, or even swamps, marshes, and other moist lands. Land Cnidarians[ ] Jellyfish[ ] Jellyfish are similar to those in the OUU, but they can evolve to live on land. However, because they are 90-95% water, they require a moist environment. They are mostly immobile, but some can be pelagic in a variety of ways. USRA[ ] A - Aerozote- A jellyfish noted for being commonly found in land reefs and various other wet environments.

It appears in dark-purple inky fog clouds of it's own excretion, and punishes sinners by consuming them, stinging them to death, and quickly digesting them in a matter of 1 second. It was used as a means to scare bad people into behaving when they go too far, but such a thing has been outdated and stopped being told since everyone became too smart to believe it. Criss-Crossers[ ] - Campion- A Crossing of a Scorpian with a Camel, where the front legs become instent pincers and a large scorpian tail waits at the rear end. These are creatures found most promdonently in Phend worlds. With both capabilities of camels and scorpians, Campions are intelligent beasts and are soical creatures, instently capable to detect danger even without seeing it first thanks to the scorpian side of it having the wing-like attactments on it's underside capable to detect water to store into it's hump or danger from the sand. Sometimes, they're used to help detect escaped enemies or prisoners of the Phends. - Buzztures- A litteral cross of a Vulture and a wasp and another predominant creature of Phend worlds. They're a hivemind that scavinge remains of a kill or a victim of the desert, where they eat some of the meat for themselves and take what they don't eat to their hive, commenly in cave complexes to feed to their larva and queen and/or impourent castes. They have multable insect wings in shape of the iconic vulture wings and process deadly venom and immunity to the bateria colonies found in the dead, and capable to tear flesh and break thick skin and armor with a four-piece manable resembling a Vulture's Beak. Phends commenly used these creatures and trackers and spies against would be threats and escaping prisoners - Sandriders- A cross between an anaconda and a mongolian death worm and another (thankfully) unigte commodity of Phends. Their forked tongues are also a miniture mouth that can grab prey trying to escape and consume whole, and even if it escaped, should the prey be bitten, it'll be invenomated and die a painful death while leaving a chemical trail for the beast to follow. The scariest thing is that these creatures are super-adaptive, even when the main Phend planet was destroyed, the sandriders evolved into a space breathing varient that loom in the planet ruins and target spare-fairing creatures or even travelers. Worse off, they start out as parasites to other creatures, which enabled these deadly creatures to be brought to other planets thanks to infected animals that were brought with them. As such, now Sandriders had appeared in planets not usually known to them, mainly in Phend colonies. Fortuntaltey, Phends, even at their time being at their absolute worse, do not wish Sandriders apawn their enemies, apart from being as a form of exicution, but only to the most absolute worse of any prisoner or insulter of the Phends. - Scawks- A cross between a hawk and a scarab. An omnivore spieces, though they do attract more to meat, Scawks have beautiful colored wings and wing cases that resemble hawk-wings, and beetle-eqsed talons designed to grab and skcewer prey, they can travel for miles at high speeds and can see for miles beyond ends. A unigte case for Phend worlds, the Scawks are commenly tamed as compians and are viewed as a heroldry animal of superiority and ahority that must be respected. Any who insults the superior, or his pet, or both, the insulter will often end up having the small parts of his body, eyes, ears, the tongue espeically, fingers and thumbs (Espeically if the middle finger jesture was used), toes, even their privates (if an act of harrassing or violating a superior's loved one or female relitive accured) and feed them to the pet Scawk as a harsh reminder of their athurity and a counter-insult to the insulter. Sometimes, the pet Scawk can even attack a would be threat of it's master and use it's hawk beak-shaped manables to do serious damage in the facial area, or even \"below the belt\" if the face were to be protected or if the threat's \"family jewels\" are deemed a more effective target. Scawks are used in the same way like the Buzztures in tracking and spying, but for a more personal level by the superior. - Clawder- A literal spider-crab cross, in that it's a spider with crab claws, a crab shell and some crab features, but their Funnel-Web-like fangs ultamately confirm their spider heratedge. Another creature of Phends, they behaive more closely to crabs then what you would assume from a crab/spider hybrid. Omnivores, they commenly wish to dine on plant matter and rottening carcusses or scraps left by Buzztures. They're generally passive and would sooner retreat in their holes then fight when a threat aroses, but when forced, they can deliver a desitating bite with their milky venom. Clawders are generally social creatures and live in herds, where they are mostly female and young, while males are often loners and either only travel by themselves or in bachular groups if they were siblings. Clawders are mainly farmed and herded by Phends for their milky venom of which Phends defelupted an ammunity to and drank in decent amounts because that in term strengthens their own venom. Don't worry, the venom is something that has to be injected for it to be deadly, ingesting has no real serious effects. It actselly tastes like normal milk (or what passes as AUU milk) and non-Phends can enjoy it themselves, that is unless your allergic to Clawder venom or at the least if it's your first time where the worse that happens is quiseiness and motion sickness, where it's worse if your allergic, but otherwise non-fatal. Clawder silk is also used to make Phend clothing materials that is strong, unbreakable and can even survive from a majority of lazer blasts, hence the creation of \"Battle Robes\" for the Phend millaterry. Clawders are RARELY eaten other then as a form of cremation where the Clawder's life is celebrated as a feast and the whole thing has to be eaten once it dies of old age or if it was killed by a predator or died of sickness (after it was throughohly cleansed alchourse). This tradition was made because dying or dead Clawders tend to attract savingers and/or predators that caught the whiff and would often threaten and endanger the living clawders over the carcuss. - Sheepines- A cross of sheep and/or goats with the abilities and features of porqupines and hedgehogs. As suppose to wool, the unigte Phend creature can grow body covering spines that can impale threats with spikes with the tip laced with toxens design to irritate predators and embulate Sandrider chemical trails so a rash will be the least of a predator's problems. The Sheepines can also curl up into balls as a defenseive manuver and roll down hills for a quick escape or even as a form of attack rolling down hills against threats with herd mentality. Both Males and Females can become extreme volitale when provoked or on the defenive. Males often own female herds up to the thoundsons with horns so grand it's amazing that it can manage to curl into a successful ball. Speaking of which, sometimes in contests, both males can curl up into balls, rev up and speed up against eachother and uncurl just in time to head-butt eachother, often making a force that can be felt even in miles away from the scene because of nearly breaking the sound barrior into skulls that evolved think enough to withstand pressure. The loudest pressure by the best male wins the prize of females and terratory. Phends often farm and herd Sheepines for their quills to make spike-covered armor design to bring great pain to enemies and to protect against assassins. In more extreme Phend Cultures, Sheepines are saciviced to weather gods in cultist rituals. - Gouse- A Goat-Mouse cross and another Phend creature which is their faverite shorce of meat. Gouse are asentually goats with mouse tails and ears and rodent-eqsed teeth. They can be stubbern as goats and usually thrive best in rocky evioments in Phend worlds. Living in harsh worlds, the Gouse has adapted to eat beyond it's herbavore range and came to consume sand and rocks with a digestive tract designed to handle this. When Gouse are not turned into meat, they can be kept as companions that use their abilities to find water pockets or oasis for their owners to use. Some Gouses are desinated as food, others are treated like having pethood and are never eaten apart from cremation alou to how Clawders are treated. Again, just buring the Gouse, runs the risk of inviting savingers and/or predators to cause trouble. - Donkesaurus- A Donkey-Eqsed Hadrosaur creature and another commodity of Phend Socity. The braying beasts are used as pack animals often by mercents and far distent travelers. They are just as hard to work with as normal donkeys, but they are great for early warning systems of predators or other dangers with their super-sensitive donkey-like ears and good vision. These creatures can process a mean, often fatal buck or kick that even Phends have to be careful not to be around the back. - Ele-Vine- Giant Mixtures between Elephants and Bovines in general, commenly to cows and bulls, and aother Phend creature. The Males can have tusks that resemble bull horns and can reach scary heights, while females have small and barely visable tusks. They came come in certain patterns, but are often grey in colors. They can be riden by Phends to ride off into war and desistate vast armies with ease because of how huge they are. We are talking close to the giant elephants from Lord of the Rings. Even the greatest tank can be simply stomped on by a Ele-Vine's foot without even too much effert. Their skin is incredability thick, even to the strongest laser as all it would do is bring their anger towords you. - Hy-Otes- Basicly, it's what would happen if Hyenas and Coyotes were to mate. Hy-Otes, another beast of the world of Phends, are pretty much coyotes with the body and abilities of hyenas. Both a predator and a savinger, Hy-Otes often come in packs and are oppatunistic killers. They can even take on a Sandrider with the right stragity. Long snouts with bone-crushing jaws that enable them to eat even bones or hard exoskelitons, and a strong immunity against even the deadlist nateral venom. Hy-Otes are capable of good memory and un-charactisticly sofisicated standerds for creatures of their caliber, allowing them to adapt in even evioments alien to them and would adjust to all nature and naterol challnages. They can learn what to take on and what to avoid, espeically with Phends. - Lizardapede- A mix between basic lizards and centapedes, these usually small desert travelers have alot of hard to count legs capable of long distence travel, can borrow quickly and depending on type, can have typical lizard defences, like frills or the horny toad's infamous blood-eyes defence, and can come in many types. The really big Lizardapedes, commenly around the size of average snakes and can rarely be the size of average crocs or komodos, live far under ground in Phend Planets. Dispite being lizards, sometimes Lizardapedes can behavie abit more like snakes due to their bodies. Phends often consider them to be vermin because they often steal their food and/or spread desert deseises and always finding nests of them hiding in Phend homes. In some Phend cultures, they can be considered a delicay. Thanks to them boarding Phend ships, Lizardapedes have spread far beyond their native planet and became just as problematic as local Vrats and other native pests. Lizardapedes are often subugated to very rough Alberta-like standerds if their populations get too much. - Turab- Turtle-Eqsed Scarab beetles that thrive in caves or anichent ruins in Phend worlds. They can range tio standerd sizes to being as big as Goliath Beetles, Turabs can travel in large swarms and often feast on whatever the beetles are best preferent to eat. If vegatarian, they target plants and sometimes are problematic to crops of Phends. If predatory, a large enough swarm can be a threat to even the biggest Ele-Vine Bull. They can crawl into victims bodies The Mummy-Sytile, then target and consume valuable organs, even the brain, to quickly kill and consume would-be prey. Turabs are at best pests, at worse, a danger for even Phends to avoid, because apart from dietary hapits, it's hard to seperate between the kinds of Turabs without a risky closer inspectation. They also have the turtle ability to regress into their shells when things get dangerious. - SandSwimmer- A spieces of bug-legged Sand Fishes native to Phendian, but had easily managed to spread beyond it and became known system wide in desert planets. As the name suggests, the creatures swim in the sands and leap out of it like it was water. In Phend culture, they're considered to be a good shorce of meat and food for themselves and lifestock, but because of becoming a successful invasive spieces cause of their hapits of being attracted to Phend ships because they liked to hide in dark places, they end up in other desert planets, even ones not extreme as Phend arabic-like deserts, and spread like wildfire. Cause of it, some desert planets the SandSwimmers came to inhapit tend to be treated in Alberta-Eqsed extermination projects because of the would-be threat of damaging native ecosystems not best suited to house native fauna and the SandSwimmers. Though SandSwimmers are rarely dangerious to sentients, they are predatory fish and eat anything small enough for engulp whole, or in some cases attack larger prey in packs alure to pharanias. Sometimes, SandSwimmers are found in places that have beaches or islands, where they can be even more problamatic to creatures not suited to deal with them, and thus have to be given a treatment simular to how Snakeheads are treated in the Everglades.

It comes in over 85 species across the AUU. - Coomber- A large treeshroom that has a patterned top cap, a thick stalk, and is commonly known to form on specific geological formations. They were originally native to Klonium, but they are now apparent on many worlds across the AUU. - Cactorate- A large cactus-like mushroom that forms the same niche as cacti on certain worlds. On a large rough stalk, and a large green cap with needles all over it, it can survive the harshest of environments. - Algarra- A table mushroom that is known for having a bed that supports algae, which it shares a symbiotic relationship with, providing it with food. - Creebey- A mushroom that is known for having 4-to-6 dangling spider-leg-like arms that it uses for defense or for feeding. They are very hostile when a creature gets too close. They come in 14 different species across the AUU. - Vobe- A mushroom that has a small stalk, and fire-colored cap, and dark-to-bright green poisonous barbs on it's top. It feeds and sucks up the juices of it's prey through these barbs, and ejects them when they get too old, as the barbs are actually it's spore that it spreads to reproduce. It comes in 54 different species across the AUU. - Giflack- A species of large mushroom that come in large bunches, are very poisonous, and it sprays anything with non-allergenic pollen when it gets too close. There are 29 different species across the AUU. - Soof- A glowing blue mushroom with no stalk, and grows on cave surfaces and slopes in numbers, spraying spores and luring prey in and from the hole within it's top. There are 791 species across the AUU. - Eycle- A soof that is too resembling of an eye, and is known to look like that to scare off predators that may feed on it. - Ameni- An anemone-like clear transparent fungi that feeds on anything that gets stuck in it. - Bubgus- A fungal stalk that looks like a stalk of bubbles that feed on anything that get stuck in it. - Famn- A spotted fan-like mushroom that feeds on sunlight and nutrients from the ground. - Feeler- A fungal berry mushroom that has poisonous structures that keep it from being eaten as the berry is actually a vital. - Fungtrap- A Venus flytrap-like mushroom that traps it's prey. - Hotte- An edible tube-like mushroom filled with hot spices. - Lampa- A bioluminescent lamp-like mushroom that comes in a million different species across the AUU. - Meniscoid- A bulbous swelling mushroom that infamously litters terrestrial parks and hampers walking. - Zongus- A spongey amphibious mushroom that can both filter feed from both the ground and when submerged underwater and thus is found in flood-plagued areas. Small Fungi[ ] - Fungworm- A worm-like infectious slime-mold fungal infection similar to ringworms that feeds off of internals upon ingestion, and is common among cattle and cattle-like beings. Responsible for the endangerment of the Curuon race, and is currently being handled by Helix Transgenics. - Buddum- A colony of hardened spongy slime mold that grows on the sides of mounds and forms a collective intelligence. They come in 5,009 different species across the AUU. - Luxopo- A slime mold that is normally found in caves and other subterranean landscapes, providing bioluminescent light to it's ecosystem. - Durmamold- A slime mold that is best known to form into a glass within time, and hold an integrity that is dense enough to hold any kind of pressure. There are over 8,000 different species across the AUU. - Peproom- A dried edible pepper-like slime mold that hangs on tigh heights and traps anything that flies in while consuming, and only becomes edible when dead, which is what counts as ripeness. Microbes[ ] Protists[ ] - Amega- An amoeba capable of greater shapeshifting than it's OUU variant, and like it, it comes in a thousand different species, many of which are highly infectious and aquatic. - Endosporoxoum- A digestive-tract-dwelling protozoan parasite that can be found in rotting meat, and is known to cause constipation and diarrhea by interfering with the digestive process by dwelling in the stomach and even hitching a ride to other hosts through defecation. It can cause symptoms such as cramps, nutrient deprivation, and weakening health and even atrophy. - Crucydiod- A worm-like parasitic protist that contains a large strand of DNA inside itself along with advanced ribosomes and RNA. These creatures originated from Planet Thexus, and they evolved from viruses that were able to replace a portion of a host's DNA with itself via looking like a DNA portion. Over time, it evolved to assimilate new and more complex hosts via it's current worm-like form, and came to control Thexus' biota. Then they took an entire millennia's worth of evolving to assimilate a new kind of host: The Crucyds, an ambitious adventurous marsupial race that ended up being corrupted permanently by this parasite. The Vocerkans, discovering this genetic parasite, wiped out all life on Thexus including the Crucyds to stop the parasite, while the remnant DNA of the Crucyds would effective always carry the genetic code to make more Crucydiods, thus cloning of the Crucyds had to be prevented at any cost, while life on Thexus was replaced with outside biota. Bacteria[ ] - Baccillium necrosi- A sentient bacteria which is commonly responsible for the Composure sickness on Planet Horvathos. This is a flesh-eating bacteria which had an unknown origin, and it commonly causes skin to rot and decompose quickly, can cause organ failure, and will kill in no less than 5 days. This bacteria is difficult to maintain because it is capable of adapting to any medicine or vaccination. - Aminorrhea phagerus- A species of infectious bacteria which causes it's sickness by feeding on amino acids and proteins from the body, causing weakening muscles and disrupted growth. There is a cure for this disease. - Meniscutimus spotticus- A bacterial infection widely known as Bubble Spots, which produce large spots full of pus that hurt when popped, and wear off in as low as 24 hours back into the skin as soon as the immune system fights it off. Symptoms include burning sensations, aside a few other painful feelings, and nausea. - Chloroxabus narcus- A bacteria which is the cause of the Green Death, a sickness which causes symptoms such as green skin, dark-green tender spots which are painful to touch, weakening of the immune system, and even death. There have been several plagues of this infection throughout known AUU history. - Xenoplast-88- A genetically-engineered parasitic virulent organism that was created during the AUU Third Cartoonian War on Planet Mox as a germ warfare weapon. Unfortunately, it spread and started an infectious invasion, molding helpless victims into drones as it thrives through a parasitic relationship with other organic lifeforms. The infection itself is a hive-mind, as all individuals are controlled by a single mind. When bonding, if not treated within the next 24 hours, the infection's mutative effects will be permanent. When the infection was set loose on Mox, a high-tech rebellion force was formed to oppose it's infectious reign, especially with the help of the corporation known as Mox International Defense Industries (MIDI). There are over a dozen variants of the infection depending on the infected individual. Drones are the most common form that is a fresh new bonding that is still very powerful and can still wield weapons of any kind, Imitators are shapeshifting white-and-black variants who pose as enemies to infiltrate their ranks, Slashers are silver-colored drones that attack without mercy with overgrown slashing claws, Grapplers that are tough black-and-red beasts that grapple using tentacle-like tendrils from their hands, Berserkers are muscular blood-red beasts with extreme strength and durability, Spikers are Berserker-like black-and-red-spotted beasts with retractable thorns on their backs, their limbs, and for their slashing claws, Giants are red-black-and-brown variants coming from those of the infected that were bigger than average, Parasites that are slags of goo that infect gradually without showing no restraint, Spawner Pods that both augment and reproduce and create more parasites, Wingers are large bat-like muscular beasts that attack from the sky with their quick flying and deadly slashing claws, Spawners are large gorilla-like red-and-black beasts and a variant of Berserkers that weave and produce Spawner Pods, and the most powerful of them being the Hiver, a large tentacles beast which has never been bested by any resistance fighter as it was an intelligent, strategic, and calculative fighter with it's sharp tentacles, it's ear-piercing roar, it's augmentation through Pods, and for many other abilities. The infection has caused entire megalopolises to be overrun by sticky cables, tentacles, and hives of ranging sizes to be created. The Hiver lives in the biggest hive, also known as the Stronghold, which has been impossible to penetrate even for the best of the best. - Cryombus- A well-known and infectious extremophile bacteria found in cold freezing water, and causes the common cold of the AUU, unlike in the OUU which is caused by a virus, and having the same symptoms. - Thermombus- A well-known and infectious extremophile bacteria found in hot boiling water, and can cause a disease called 'warm', and the opposite version of cold in the AUU, even being in the same family. The symptoms include the feeling of burning, flushed skin, uncontrollable perspiration even in air-conditioned environments, and quicker dehydration. - Vacuuphillium- An entire family of over 500 species of space-faring extremophile bacteria that, despite no need for oxygen, still feed on things such as heat, energy, solar energy, radiation, and various others, all of which are highly-available in space, in which they evolved in to get to. They, in a way, extend a sun's lifespan by feeding off of the building-up energy in it's system, and they nurture and length the lifespan of many other space entities. - Calalria- An alien amoeba often called 'Sea Fever' that evolved accidentally in an unknown Teadr 1 aquatic race's underwater societies before being claimed by Watans, and it is directly responsible for one of the Adapting Plagues that caused the extinction of the Teadr 1 Watans and nearly the Ollotheans. When a host is infected, and Watan data suggested that it killed over 143 billion creatures over the course of time since it's reawakening, and not just most of the Watan population. The sickness decimated Watan ecosystems, as much of the life on them died due to it's immuno-repressive behaviour and genetic corruption. This prompted the Watans to shoot down any ships approaching their colonies and assimilate them to ensure the disease doesn't spread, and the misinterpreted response nearly resulted in the disease spreading anyway. The disease incubates in two weeks and kills in five or six weeks, accomplishing this by shutting down immune system and causing genetic damage to the host's DNA to purify it's own genetic corruption, eventually leading to a total shutdown of the organism due to its inability to keep functioning properly, as it feeds on hemoglobin, proteins, anything that the immune system requires to work, and it even robs cells of their vitals and causes cancer. Warpeons were created by the Watans to keep the levels of the disease to a minimum, to do so they will attempt to kill infected fauna, in an effort to control the spread of the bacterium. Though this seems to have been ineffective as the disease still runs rampant to this very day on the heavily-quarantined colonies watched over by Futuredawn. It was discovered by the endling Watan that the only way to cure the sickness is with enzymes produced by a powerful apex predator called a Starsquid, which can breath in both water, air, and space, and is a wanderer around a limited number of territories across the AUU, and have been rare since the Teadr 1 Era, and the Warpeons and the Starsquid have the enzyme, called Enzyme-91, have it to fight off the disease. But since the endling died of the disease before the cure could be shared, his isolated lab remained undiscovered. - Voropox- An infamous flesh-eating bacteria that reproduces rapidly when eating a single cell, which is enough to nurture it and produce several individuals at once. Despite it's one-day lifespan, it can rapidly reproduce and nurture itself throughout the single day, and cannot live the full day without food. It can feed on both living and dead tissue, and while much species are common decomposers, others feed on the fresh meat of living creatures, coming in through open wounds, and being widely common in wastelands and unsanitary habitats. - Proteistrichrus poli- A common form of bacterial gut flora in many forms of AUU wildlife and plays a symbiotic role in breaking down food and preventing constipation and diarrhea. But some strains can cause food poisoning. This creature can reproduce asexually, and is basically the AUU version of E. coli, and is also used in biological experiments because of their protein-rich bodies that can provide many biological miracles, and has ancestors that were reportedly the seeds of the creation of Cerwan's Mutation. - Spatipox- A giant space-faring germ that can dwell without nourishment for decades, yet it only nourishes itself for one purpose: to reproduce, which it only does through a host, which can be any number of space-faring organisms. It feeds on small creatures, but it completes much of it's lifestyle by snatching a host to carry it's thousands of eggs, which until they hatch following defecation, cause major symptoms including controlling antibodies into attacking each other, causing nausea, fatigue, creates gruesome green pox, and it has even been known to cause organ failure and even death. - Psychrum- A rare brain disease caused by a mind-jacking bacteria that bonds with brain cells and effectively controls the rest of the brain itself, nourishing itself through feeding on the organelles of brain cells. Though it primarily does this to get around, and escapes through defecation, it can get prevalent enough to leave it's host permanently affected mental-wise, with effects ranging from brain and/or nerve damage, personality changes, brain tumors, mental retardation, and lowered brain power. - Symbyle- A symbiotic bacteria that has actually been known for increasing the health of it's host by consuming harmful organisms including virus, but it too can have adverse effects at times, especially when the host is at a late age when the bacteria can't compensate an imbalanced health condition. Experimented on in biological labs, and even starting out in a Teadr 1 lab and evolving for eons into different environments ever since, it can be both beneficial and harmful as a symbiotic organism. - Thermylyte- A dangerous bacteria that is noted for excreting heat when feeding. Commonly found in hot geothermal valleys and geysers, when it ends up infecting someone, it makes them so hot that they not only die, but melt the carrion in a few more days into a biological slime. - Extremeum- An extremely prevalent and powerful extremophile bacteria that flourishes in literally everything, being an omni-thriving creature that is easily known for causing harm when being hosted by a larger organism as it thrives on their vitals. - Globugenium- A genetic bacterial parasite that becomes a multicellular being by consuming and replacing genetic material within the host and slowly turning it into a drone and a changed lifeform that disintegrates into infectious bacteria that continue the life cycle. Their origin may be unknown, but they mainly evolved through harsh landscapes dominated by multicellular creatures. - Globin- A hive-minded radical sentient-like bacterium descendant of the Resolutan Globugenium that acts together and mimic multicellular beings through consuming other cells and evolving through them. They can replicate any biological features and mimic their prey. They have been responsible for the extinction of the Teadr 1 Transids. - Organolithrobus- The most common builder of organoliths. Organoliths are geological formations that form from deceased creatures. Their organic matter can be preserved by this bacteria, which evolved from fossil-feeding bacteria that produce a renewable type of fossil fuel as they feed. Organolithrobus bacteria preserve the organic matter and protect it from decomposition by using specialized organelles to copy the DNA of the dead host cells. The purpose of this is to not only provide themselves food, but also provide food for other decomposers, allowing them to cultivate a microbial symbiosis inside an organolith. - Fossolithrobus- A still-living ancestor of Organolithrobus that are noted for feeding off of fossils, and create fossil fuels as a byproduct of their decomposition. Some like the Eroxxon Corporation or others have sought use in this bacteria. Viruses[ ] USRA[ ] - Nanovirus- An artificial species of virus created by sentient beings to act as the basic form of nanomachine. These viruses can be used in healing tanks, surgery, or other medical procedures, among a variety of other uses. - Nanovirus lethus- A rogue species of Nanovirus which is known to be very lethal and can reproduce quickly. When infected, a person can start swelling for a precedent amount of time depending upon the type of nanovirus, and if not cured, could lead to a serious injury when the swelling eventually expands and explodes in massive amounts of pus. There are 7 types of Nanovirus lethae, and 4 of them have cures, but all of them have vaccinations. - Crimsovirus- A virus responsible for Crimson influenza, and exist in 5 types. The symptoms of this infection includes flushed red skin, fatigue, minor to major burning sensations, and a few weakening red blood cells. There is no cure, and the vaccination is difficult to produce. - Azumanella virus- A virus responsible for the Blue Pox, existing in 10 types. The symptoms of this infection includes deep-blue spots, nausea, dizziness, and itching. Vaccinations exist, and 2 cures exist for 2 types of this infection. - Phobovirus- A brain infecting virus which targets pain receptors and can cause the victim to experience some innate fears. There is no cure for this sickness, and the infection can last for almost 6 weeks. - Omnivirus- An elaborate genus of viruses that are commonly known by the name 'Sentience Immunodeficiency Virus' (SIV), and the infamous causer of Omni-Immune Deficiency Syndrome (OIDS), where the virus completely destroys the immune system from the inside-out to the point of complete failure as it feeds on antibodies and other immune system products, and it reproduces rather quickly, allowing for a lot of mouths to feed. They are basically the AUU version of HIV/AIDS. - Xluquenza- A virus that is common all over the AUU, and is basically the AUU version if the Influenza virus, and comes in far more variants, having over 97 species all across the AUU. - Furyvirus- The AUU version of rabies, and an infamous virus in both non-sentient, semi-sentient, and sentient animals, as any of them infected with the virus go savage and there is a cure and vaccination for the disease, but it's hard to administer it as the infected victim knows nothing but animal brutality. - Ribozomvirus- A genus of Flavivirus-like viruses found in jungle and savannah-like climates that are common for feeding on the ribosomes and proteins of cells and killing the cells themselves, resulting in rashes filled with dead cells that need to be removed during treatment to clear out the infection's territory. - Traumovirus- A sentient tragedy-experiencing brain sickness caused by a virus with a large and powerful brain case. It feeds off of adrenaline and thus manipulates the brain into inducing stress and fear, thus giving it what it needs to survive, despite side-effects being hazardous to the host's health, often determined by their age and health conditions. - Hemofernillum- A deadly viral disease known to cause uncontrollable bleeding to the point of atrophy of the circulatory system, heart failure, and later death. This is a virus that incubates in water, and hosts any form of creatures. - Iliadaptus- A viral disease that was created by a Teadr 1 mad scientist in an attempt to evolve the entire AUU under his rule until the disease got out, caused an AUU-wide plague, and later got obscured wildly to the point of being a highly-rare species. The virus is incapable of evolving because it can only do so when possessing a host, and as it infects a host, it and the host evolve into highly-dangerous and often uncontrollable forms. UIS[ ] - Stasovirus- An influenza-like virus that causes Ice-Cold Flu or Stasis Flu, a disease that causes the same effects as cryogenic freezing on a living person. It does this by producing the same chemicals as those found in cryostasis like liquid nitrogen, basically freezing a host from the inside-out, causing mild fever, congestion, nausea, blueness of the skin, frostbite, organ failure, and even death.
