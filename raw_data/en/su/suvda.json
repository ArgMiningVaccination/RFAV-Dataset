If so, you may have heard of toxic release. After your first chiropractic adjustment, you may experience slight cold or flu-like symptoms. It's not because the chiropractic practice did something wrong or the practice is unclean, but because of toxic release. Here's what you need to know. Toxic Release: What Is It? Approximately 20% of patients experience toxic release after a chiropractic adjustment. It might sound intimidating, but it should be considered a positive reaction to treatment. The toxins in the body are being released by chiropractic manipulations, which is great news! With that great news comes a slight downside in that expelling the toxins in the body comes with some unpleasant, albeit temporary, symptoms. Fortunately, you can take comfort in the fact that your body is adjusting to the removal of toxins and the pesky side effects will soon fade. Toxic Release Symptoms If you do experience toxic release (and the vast majority of chiropractic patients do not), the symptoms include fatigue, headache, night sweaters, tight muscles, and diarrhea. Feeling fatigued after an adjustment is also common because the body is adjusting to the way the nervous system responds to treatment. Before an alignment, the nervous system is usually blocked by subluxations. With the use of chiropractic treatment, the subluxations are removed and nerves function optimally, which can be tiring at first as the body has been deprived for some time. Toxic Release Truth The body is reacting to chemical signals between the spinal cord and the brain all day long. When that flow of energy is disrupted because of subluxations (also known as dysfunctions of the spine), daily action is slowed down. Clearing the blockages and interruptions allows energy flow to return to its optimal speed, but means the body needs an adjustment period, leaving it feeling tired and even sick. Imagine your nervous system is like a garden hose. When there's a kink in the hose, water gets jammed up and cannot flow. This also applies to the nervous system. If there is a subluxation present in your spine, it causes pressure to build up by blocking the flow of energy. That pressure then causes many ailments including headaches and chronic issues. Once that pressure is released with chiropractic care, the renewed flow of energy can cause some cold-like symptoms. Keep in mind that toxic release symptoms don't last long, and chiropractic will soon have you feeling great! To learn more about what to expect during your first chiropractic adjustments, just ask!
