It is of crucial importance to model an inte- grated/combined package of non-pharmaceutical (physical/social distancing) and pharmaceutical (immunization) public health controlmeasures. A modified epidemiological, compartmental SIR model was used and fit to the cumulative COVID-19 case data for the province of Ontario, Canada, from 8 September 2020 to 8 December 2020. Differentvaccine roll-out strategies were simulated until 75% of the population was vaccinated, including a no-vaccination scenario. We compete these vacci- nation strategies with relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions.Non-pharmaceutical interventions were supposed to remain enforced and began to be relaxed on 31 January, 31 March or 1 May 2021. Based on pro- jections from the data and long-term extrapolation of scenarios, relaxing the public health measures implemented by re-opening too early would cause any benefits of vaccination to be lost by increasing case numbers, increasingthe effective reproduction number above 1 and thus increasing the risk of localized outbreaks. If relaxation is, instead, delayed and 75% of the Ontar- ian population gets vaccinated by the end of the year, re-opening can occurwith very little risk. Relaxing non-pharmaceutical interventions by re-opening and vaccine deployment is a careful balancing act. Our combination of model projections from data and simulation of different strategies and scenarios, canequip local public health decision- and policy-makers with projections concern- ing the COVID-19 epidemiological trend, helping them in the decision-making process. 1. Introduction The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel,emerging coronavirus, belonging to the class of enveloped, single-stranded,positive-sense RNA viruses [1]. SARS-CoV-2 is the infectious agent responsible for the still ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This res- piratory disease is generally mild and even asymptomatic, but in a proportionof cases can worsen, becoming particularly severe and even life-threatening [2]. Owing to the lack of effective vaccines and drugs that could prevent the infection and properly treat patients, as well as given the highly contagiousnature of the virus and its quick spread, public health agencies have decided to implement non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) [3]. NPIs have become necessary also due to the unprecedented strain on the health systems \u00a9 2021 The Authors.

Two major strategies have been developed: an eradication and a mitigation strategy, based on the stringency of the measures adopted [3]. Several vaccine candidates have been designed, and, recently , some of them have entered phase III clinical trials [4]. Immunization campaigns are anticipated to be particularly challenging in that a large number of subjects needs to bevaccinated in a short span of time. Countries will have to face unprecedented logistic and organizational issues, coping with shortage of healthcare personnel staffing. It can beexpected that, before immunizing an adequate amount of indi- viduals necessary to achieve herd immunity , public health authorities will have to continue enforcing NPIs. Mathematicalmodelling can assist public health decision- and policy- makers in the decision-making process, regarding the dynami- cal modulation of the de-escalation/relaxation of the publichealth measures adopted, towards a gradual re-opening strategy. We will take Ontario, Canada, as a case study, but our model is a general-purpose one and, after being properlyparametrized and informed with locally available data, can be adapted to any country/scenario. The model presented here is one that hybridizes statistical, data-driven models and mechanistic scenario-based models. The model is able to use a modest data set of known cases to esti- mate key epidemiological parameters. The mechanistic nature ofthe model allows us to then modify the model a posteriori to account for dynamics that are notably missing in the data. In this case, we focus on modifications involving vaccination strat-egies competing with reopening strategies. We use Ontario, Canada as a case study as it is the largest province in Canada and has consistently been an area of concern within the country. 1.1. Non-pharmaceutical interventions in Ontario Canada belongs to those countries that have decided toimplement a mitigation rather than an eradication strategy.The first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported on 25 January 2020 and, since then, as of 2 January 2020, Canada has experienced a burden of 590 280 cases, with 15 715 deaths.The Federal government and the province of Ontario have enforced an integrated package of public health interventions. In particular, the Ontario province has closed schools anduniversities on 14 March, declared emergency on 17 March, restricting public events and recreational venues, and closed non-essential workplaces on 24 March. These control measu-res have been escalated and gradually become more and more stringent, significantly contributing to mitigate against COVID-19 and saving lives.1.2. Vaccine deployment in Ontario Currently , two mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines have beenauthorized by the Canadian regulatory body 'Health Canada '. On 14 December 2020, Canada started administering the first vaccine doses, according to the federal vaccine plan shown in figure 1. The Ontario Government plan consists ofthree phases: during the phase I, vaccine doses are limited and healthcare workers working in hospitals, long-term care and retirement homes, congregate care settings and otherhealth facilities as well as members of remote, under-served, either urban or rural, Indigenous communities (such as First Nation communities, M\u00e9tis and Inuit adults) are being priori-tized. During phase II, which is likely to start in Winter 2021, the list of people who can get vaccinated will be further expanded. Finally, during phase III, any person willing to beimmunized will receive their vaccine doses. Specifically con- cerning the Ontario province, more than 20 hospitals will be involved in the immunization campaign. 2. Methods 2.1. COVID-19 dynamics model We use the model and fitting techniques developed in [6]. All data and code are available on a GitHub repository [7]. Themodified SIR model is developed to forecast epidemic trajec-tories using minimal cumulative case data of an outbreak. Themodel in [6] is used to estimate and quantify the rate of under-reporting, the efficacy of preventative measures in healthcare set-tings, the basic reproduction number and the efficacy of NPIs.The model uses re-scaled time; time is measured in infectionincubation periods, ^tto further reduce the required parameters. The model is purposefully kept simple to facilitate data- fitting. The main purpose of this model, as outlined in [6], is toprovide confident estimates of parameter values from whichwe can forecast forward. In order to do this effectively withmodest datasets during an outbreak, it is necessary to maintaincontrol of the number of parameters. The compartments we are interested in are the number of mild cases, I m, the number of severe cases, Is, the cumulative known cases CKand cumulative incidence CI. Mild cases are those which present no or mild symptoms; severe cases are thosewhich present obvious symptoms or require hospitalization.We make the following assumptions in the model: \u2014The total population is constant. \u2014Acquired immunity lasts longer than the outbreak. \u2014There is no co-infection or super-infection. \u2014The testing/reporting rate in the population is relatively constant. \u2014The probability of a case being severe versus mild is constant. 2020 December Canada receives supply that will cover 3M CanadiansCanada has secured enough supply to enable all Canadians to be immunized in 20212021 March2021 Figure 1. The Federal Government vaccine roll-out plan, adapted from [5].royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsif J. R. Soc. Interface 18: 202100092\u2014All severe infections are reported, whereas a fraction of mild infections are. The model equations are then given (2:1) where Nis the total susceptible population, R pis the population reproduction number which differs from the basic reproductionnumber as we calculate this value in the middle of an outbreakfor a specific population; for a discussion on the basic reproduc-tion number and its estimate see [6], p sis the probability of severe infection, ris the average testing/reporting rate, M(^t) is a mitiga- tion function, and ^tis time scaled by the average infectious lifetime 1/ . Note that Model (2.1) accounts for, but does not assume, that severe infections are less infectious than mild or asymptomaticinfections by a factor of p. We include psince in novel or dangerous epidemics severe cases are often managed and quarantined onceknown. Figure 2 shows a compartmental diagram of Model (2.1). Model (2.1) is coupled with four initial conditions, derived from three parameters: I m(0)\u00bcIm0, Im(0)\u00bcIs0, CK(0)\u00bcCK0 and CI(0)\u00bcIm0\u00feIs0\u00feR,9 >>= >>;(2:2) where Ris the number of cases that have already recovered or died by the time we start fitting data.The function M(t) is a predetermined function that captures the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions on rates ofinfection. When fitting, we use a functional form of M(t)\u00bck\u00fe(1/C0k)e /C0mt: (2:3) This allows us to quantify both socially driven relaxation and adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions. 2.2. Vaccine deployment versus social distancing The primary aim of vaccination is to reduce the number ofsusceptible individuals in the community. This is accounted forwith the change NN(t).N(t) is defined as a function which starts at N(^s)\u00bcN, where Nis the total population and ^sis the day of vaccine deployment, and approaches N(t)\u00bc1/C0L 1\u00fee/C0d(t/C0^s)/C18/C19 N,( 2 :5) where Lis the proportion of the population we expect to be vac- cinated, ^sand dare shape parameters that determines how quickly the vaccine is deployed. 2.3. Data fitting We fit our model to the cumulative case data for the provinceof Ontario from 8 September 2020 to 8 December 2020 for the2020 COVID-19 pandemic; 8 September 2020 was chosenbecause of the observed significant increase in the number ofreported infected cases. Fits were done until 8 December 2020as at the time of the analyses this was the most current dataavailable. Of course, projections can be adjusted by taking more recent data as it is made available. To reduce the number of scenarios considered, we fit system (2.1) to cumulative case data prior to vaccine deployment.Using the fitted parameters, we can then explore differentfunctional forms of N(t) to determine the effects of different vaccination strategies on the epidemic curve. We fit the vectorof parameters: v\u00bc[I m0,Is0,Rp,N,p,r,m,k,d]( 2 :6) using least squares on the cumulative reported cases per day and the new daily reported cases G(v)\u00bcX t[tdata(CK(t;V)/C0(~CK)t)2\u00fe((C0 Figure 2. A compartmental diagram of Model (2.1). From a population N, we assume infection presents as either mild or severe with probability ps. Infection spreads at rate RpM(t). Infection clears at rate 1. All infections are added to two compartments: CI, the cumulative case load of the outbreak and CKthe known case load. All severe infections are assumed to be known and reported, and a fraction rof mild infections are known and reported. The compartment CKis highlighted as it is the compartment we use to fit to data.royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsif J. R. Soc. Interface 18: 202100093As described in [6], we bootstrap the fitting by running 1000 fits starting from randomized initial guesses and over random subsets of the data. We then average over all simulations. This process has two benefits: it allows us to perform sensitivityanalysis while simultaneously avoiding problems caused bycomplex surfaces with many local minima. 2.3.1. Outcome of different vaccine roll-out strategies Using the estimated parameters, we explore different scenariosthat could result with vaccine roll-out. We start by defining alogistic roll-out strategy N(t)\u00bc1/C0 L 1\u00fee/C0d(t/C0T)/C18/C19 N: (2:8) We choose a logistic form of N(t) as it is the simplest functional form that allows for (a) a ramping up of vaccine procurement and deployment and (b) saturation. Later on, we also considera linear vaccination strategy where daily deployment is constantuntil 75% of the population is vaccinated. Using public data about the vaccine roll-out [5,8], we set par- ameters of N(t). We use L= 0.75 based on a STATCAN survey [8]; meaning we are limited to 75% of the population of Ontariogetting vaccinated. Using the projections from [5], we set dand Tsuch that approximately 10% of the population will be vaccinated by March 2021 and all voluntary vaccination willbe completed by the end of 2021. This gives us d0.433 and T= 24.73, keeping in mind our re-scaled time from the fitting. We first study the outcome of this vaccination strategy assumingthat the non-pharmaceutical interventions are to remain in placeat the current levels of acceptance and adherence. These par-ameters are summarized in table 1 and the vaccination curve isshown in figure 3.Of course, at some point non-pharmaceutical interventions must be lifted. We can compete these two factors by modifyingM(t). If we we begin relaxation of non- pharmaceutical interventions. The parameter is a shaping parameter that controls the speed of relaxation. Relaxationfrom the current value of R pto the accepted average basic repro- duction number of 2.5 is shown in figure 4 for different values of. A Holling Type II function is the simplest function that allows for relaxation over time as well as saturation. We set to be the date relaxation begins and set accordingly so that by the end of 2021, non-pharmaceutical interventions arecompletely relaxed. We maintain that M(t) is a function of time alone so that we are can remain general about how and when these relaxations may manifest themselves. For instance, non-pharmaceutical interventions may relax through policy , fatigue,or apathy as interventions remain in place for long periods of time. 3. Results 3.1.

Assuming a 75% vaccination rate in Ontario with fixed non-pharmaceutical interventions Shown in figure 5 are the total cases (purple), known cases (green), active mild cases (red) and active severe cases (blue). We see that all active cases are resolved by September 2021, given the vaccination strategy used in the simulation. As shown in figure 6, when considering the current infection rate, with the assumption that will approach 75% vaccination of the population by September 2021, we observe that the effect ofthe vaccine will only be seen after the peak has occurred where the province will be able to ensure that the outbreak ends around July 2020 (pink line) rather than January 2022, as seen in the case of no vaccine roll-out (blue line). 3.2.2. Relaxation For the sake of comparison, we present a scenario wherebyNPIs relaxation starts on 8 December 2020 without any vac- cination plan. This scenario is presented in figure 7 as a worst case scenario stemming from the model. As expected,without any mitigation strategies we would observe a greater number of infected cases, compared to the case where a 75% vaccination rate is assumed with NPIs remaining in place atthe current levels of acceptance and adherence. The figure shows that by removing NPIs without any vac- cination, we will see an approximately 80% attack rate inOntario. This is in line with estimates provided by other models [11,12]. 3.2.3. Assuming a 75% vaccination rate in Ontario and non- pharmaceutical interventions relaxed quickly Figure 8 shows the effects of relaxing NPIs too early. For this scenario, we set T= 14.5 and = 10. We see that all active cases are still resolved by September 2021 (figure 8 a) and we see no new cases by July 2021 (figure 8 b), but the in the interim the caseload in the province increases. 3.2.4. Assuming a 75% vaccination rate in Ontario current non- pharmaceutical interventions relaxed from 31 March 2021 Figure 9 shows that phasing in relaxation starting on 31 March 2021 allows the province of Ontario to maintain con-trol of vaccination roll-out and reopening. In this case, we vary and set T= 20.4. We seen in figure 9 a,dthat if we phase-in reopening slowly then we can maintain control ofthe outbreak and allow for the realization of vaccination to be seen. Figure 9 b,e,f,cshows that increasing the speed of reopening can be detrimental to the control of the outbreakand can outpace the vaccine roll-out. 3.2.5. Assuming a 75% vaccination rate in Ontario current non- pharmaceutical interventions completely removed on 1 May 2021 Figure 10 shows the effects of removing all restrictions, immediately ( = 0) on 1 May 2021. We see that by May 2021, we are able to reopen without risk of significant increase of new cases. In figure 10 a, we see that the cumulative case- load does not change significantly , but figure 10 bshows a non-negligible increase in new cases as reopening occurs. 3.3. A linear vaccination strategy We can also look at a more hypothetical, but equally valid vaccination strategy employed by the equation N(t)\u00bc1/C0L 365(t/C0T)/C18/C19 N (3:1) which suggests a constant vaccination rate across the popu- lation. Figure 11 awe see that active cases with such a strategy are not resolved until December 2021, and in figure 11 bwe see that we continue to observe new cases until August 2021.

Interpretation We explored the effects of an integrated/combined package ofboth pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical public health control measures. We demonstrated that these two inter- ventions need to be fully harmonized in order to be able toproperly control the spread of the outbreak. In the literature, there are some models modelling the impact of COVID-19 vaccination in terms of the epidemiological trend of thepandemic.

The first strategy assessed consisted of minimizing the number of infected indi- viduals, whereas in the second scenario the minimization of vaccine dose was also taken into account. Jentsch et al. [14] devised a coupled social -epidemiologi- cal model, simulating schools and unessential workplaces closures, using an evolutionary game theory-based approachand exploiting mobility data. Some vaccination strategies were age-based, whereas others targeted social contacts, or particularly frail and vulnerable groups. Immunizationcould curb deaths by 22 -77%. Vaccine availability impacted the proportion of preventable deaths: in case of vaccines already available since January 2021, targeting seniors first would be the most optimal strategy, whereas, in case of avail-ability from July 2021 on, targeting social contacts first would result in better control of the outbreak. Similar results were obtained by Grundel et al. [15], who combined an optimization-based control approach with an age-dependent epidemiological model.

Interface 18: 202100097targeting high-risk subjects was more effective in the short-term, whereas an approach based on the reduction in social contact rates wasthe optimal choice in the long-term. In terms of vaccine doses and effectiveness, authors found that greater amounts of aless effective vaccine resulted in more relaxed NPIs with respect to less amounts of a more effective vaccine. We are able to leverage the current outbreak trajectory through data-fitting to refine scenario-based approaches that compete reopening with vaccination. Current vaccination strategies employed throughout the country are focused onhigh-risk rather than high-transmission populations. As reopen- ing is, generally , not age-dependent (except school re-openings), and the focus of vaccination is on reducing risk, not necessarilytransmission, the questions addressed herein would not benefit from an age-structured model. Moreover, an age-structured model would necessarily increase the number of parameters fitted to unreasonable numbers, given the data available.The goal is to give potential dates to consider reopening with lowest risk, and timelines of potential herd immunity(in most cases, our results estimate that we will reach minimal cases per day by the end of second quarter 2021). While an age-structured model would be beneficial for developing pol- icies in greater detail, the age-structured case data are sparse at best. In [16], age-related data are given at a weekly resol-ution and are updated infrequently. While the model and methods introduced in [6] and used here are able to fit age- structured data (even those sparsely provided) it is difficultto extend scenarios from such data at said resolution. Moreover, our study focused on the provincial level (Ontario), as a case study. At the global level or regionallevel, few predictive models exist. For instance, by incorpor- ating expert opinions and mathematical models, McDonnell et al. [17] have estimated that due to the time of manufacture and distribution of the vaccine, sufficient doses globally are likely not to be available before September 2023. While our model equips local decision- and policy-makers with projec-tions about the future epidemiological trend of the COVID-19 outbreak. It would be extremely useful to provide public health agencies across the world with a tool that is flexibleenough to explore the effect of different mitigation strategies. 5. Conclusion Reopening and vaccine deployment is a careful balancing act. Using our mathematical model, we extensively explore the effect of adopting various vaccination and relaxation strat-egies on the COVID-19 epidemiological long-term projections. Our model shows that while we need not wait for herd immunity to begin relaxation of NPIs, careful moni-toring of the situation is required. The model shows that relaxation in Ontario, Canada could be safely implemented as early as May 2021, given a strong vaccination effort. Ourlinear strategies for vaccination show that reopening would require a significant delay. Our findings are able to provide public health bodies with important insights on the effect Ontario Ontario date date106(a) 105 104 103cases 102 10 1(b) 3500 30002500 2000 1500 1000 500 casesvaccine intervention relaxation data pointscurrent trajectory current trajectorymild cases mild casessevere cases severe casescum. known cases cum. known casescum. total cases cum. total cases data pointsvaccine interventionand relaxationAug 2020 Sep 2020 Oct 2020 Nov 2020 Dec 2020 Jan 2021 Feb 2021 Mar 2021 Apr 2021 Nov 2021 Dec 2021 Jan 2022 Aug 2020 Sep 2020 Oct 2020 Nov 2020 Dec 2020 Jan 2021 Feb 2021 Mar 2021 Apr 2021 Nov 2021 Dec 2021 Jan 2022 Figure 11.
