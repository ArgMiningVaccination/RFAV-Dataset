The University, operated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church, is committed to the vision of its founders and is sustained by its close association with the church. Loma Linda University is a Seventh-day Adventist coeducational, health-sciences institution located in inland southern California. It is part of the Seventh-day Adventistsystem of higher education.

PHILOSOPHY As implied by its motto, \"TO MAKE MAN WHOLE,\" the University affirms thesetenets as central to its view of education: God is the creator and sustainer of the universe. Mankind's fullest development entails a growing understanding of the individ- ual in relation both to God and society. The quest for truth and professional expertise, in an environment permeated by religious values, benefits the individual and society and advances the min-istry of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.8 SCHOOL OF ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONSOur Mission Loma Linda University, a Seventh-day Adventist Christian health-sciences institu- tion, seeks to further the healing and teaching ministry of Jesus Christ \"to makeman whole\" by: Educating ethical and proficient Christian health professionals and scholars through instruction, example, and the pursuit of truth; Expanding knowledge through research in the biological, behavioral, physi- cal, and environmental sciences and applying this knowledge to health anddisease; Providing comprehensive, competent, and compassionate health care for the whole person through faculty, students, and alumni.

It is committed to equal education and employmentopportunities for men and women of all races and does not discriminate on the basis of handicap, gender, race, color, or national origin in its educational or admissionspolicies, financial affairs, employment programs, student life and services, or anyUniversity-administered program. Any student with a documented disability (e.g., physical, learning, or psychological) who needs to arrange reasonable accommodation must contact the dean, or designee, ofthe School of Allied Health Professions. All discussions will remain confidential. To this end, the University is in compliance with Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended, and in substantial compliance with Title IX of the EducationAmendments of 1972 (34 CFR 106 et seq.), Sections 503 and 504 of the RehabilitationDiscrimination in Employment Act of 1967, and Section 402 of the Vietnam Era VeteransAdjustment Act of 1974; and does not discriminate against any employees or applicantsfor employment on the basis of age or because they are disabled veterans or veterans ofthe Vietnam era. In addition, the University administers student programs without dis-crimination on the basis of age, except in those programs where age is a bona fide acade-mic qualification for admission in accordance with the provisions of the Age Discrimina-tion Act of 1975. The University reserves constitutional and statutory rights as a religious institution and employer to give preference to Seventh-day Adventists in admissions and employ-ment, including but not limited 42 USC Secs. 12926(d)(1); Title II, Division 4, Chapter 2, Sec. 7286.5 of the CaliforniaCode of Regulations; the First Amendment to the United States Constitution; and ArticleI, Sec. 4, of the California Constitution. The University believes that Title IX regulationsare subject to constitutional guarantees against unreasonable entanglement with orinfringements on the religious teachings and practices of the Seventh-day AdventistChurch. The University expects students and employees to uphold biblical principles ofmorality and deportment as interpreted by the Seventh-day Adventist Church. TheUniversity claims exemptions from the provisions of Title IX set forth in 34 Action The University routinely monitors its educational and employment practices regarding women, minorities, and the handicapped to ensure compliance with thelaw and University policy. The University's affirmative action policy is to provide equal access to admissions, educational programs and activities, financial aid, studentservices, and employment. In compliance with Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, a grievance procedure has been established to processstudent complaints alleging violation of these regulations or of the University's policy ofnondiscrimination based on gender or handicap. Inquiries concerning Title IX may bedirected to the affirmative action officer. Employment-related discrimination complaints, including those filed by student employees, are processed in conformity with the provi- sions outlined in existing staff personnel policies. Complaints related to discrimination in academic areas are reviewed in conformity with the procedures established by the acade-mic administration.12 SCHOOL OF ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONS Karen Rieley (administrative secretary) and Charles Dart (director)\u2014 the team for marketing and retention at LLU's School of Allied Health Professions\u2014 discuss upcoming recruitment events.

Finances and employment Loma Linda University requires accepted international applicants to pay an advance interna-tional student deposit. This deposit is refundable,less any courier/mailing fees, under the followingcircumstances: 1) during the student's last quarterof enrollment at Loma Linda University, 2) when avisa is denied by a U.S. embassy or consulate, or 3)when a student terminates his/her program. United States immigration regulations require a prospective student to document his/her financialresources for tuition, fees, and living expenses.For international students, on-campus employmentis allowed but limited by visa regulations. Forexample, for F-1 and J-1 students, employment islimited to a maximum of twenty hours per weekwhile school is in session. Scholarships, assistant-ships, and living stipends are rarely available atLoma Linda University because it is a small, pri-vate university (i.e., not supported by the U.S. orCalifornia state government but rather is churchsponsored). Employment plans require approval bya designated school official in InternationalStudent Services. VISAS F-1 student visas Loma Linda University is authorized by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to issue F-visa applications (i.e., I-20 forms). The F-1 stu-dent visa is the choice for most international stu-dents attending Loma Linda University. This visaallows some nondegree study (e.g., certificates,preceptorships, and English-as-a-second-languagestudies). Degree-earning students are subject tostudy-load requirements and are allowed limitedon-campus employment. The I-20 is issued after astudent has been accepted into a program, haspaid the advance deposit, and has documentedhis/her finacial plan for the chosen program.Contact International Student Services at (909)558-4995 for further information. J exchange-visitors visas Loma Linda University has an Exchange Visitor Program that is approved by the U.S. Department of State. This J-visa exchange pro-gram is authorized to sponsor degree-earning stu-dents, nondegree (continuing education) short-term scholars, visiting professors, and researchscholars. The J-visa form, DS-2019, is issued afteran exchange visitor has been accepted into a program, scholar position, or professor position;and has documented his/her financial plan (includ-ing health insurance for J-1 and for J-2 depen-dents) for the chosen program. Loma Linda University also hosts exchange visitors who are sponsored by other organizations(e.g., Fulbright scholars). As a hosting institution,Loma Linda University has limited authority overan exchange visitor since the authority resides inthe sponsoring organization. Under current exchange-visitor regulations, J-2 dependents are allowed to enroll part or fulltime at Loma Linda University. Also, their creditsearned can be either degree or nondegree applicable. J-1 exchange visitors are allowed to work, but employment guidelines depend on the exchangecategory. Contact International Student Services at(909) 558-4955 for further information and regula-tions governing the Exchange Visitor Program. Other visas Internationals may enter the U.S. on a wide variety of visas. However, a visa may have to bechanged before a student can commence academicstudies at this University. Please contact Inter-national Student Services at (909) 558-4955 forfurther information regarding regulations and studyoptions for specific visa types. Transfer Students International students currently attending other schools in the U.S. who have either an I-20or a DS-2019 must do a school-to-school transfer.The timing of a transfer is critical for maintainingstatus; so it is important to consult with an interna-tional adviser as soon as the acceptance letter isreceived. Study load Both the F and J student-visa regulations require the successful completion of a full studyload during each quarter of each academic year (asdefined by each program). A minimum of 12 unitsper quarter is usually considered full time for anundergraduate program and 8 units per quarter fora graduate program. A reduced study load, in anyquarter, requires the prior approval ExchangeVisitor Program of a designated school official in International Student Services.

Study load Usually an academic study load is defined in terms of credit units. A full undergraduate load isconsidered to be 12 or more units per quarter; a fullgraduate load is considered to be 8 units per quarter.Professional programs, however, require consider-able clinical experience, for which only partial acad-emic credit is given at times. Consequently, a fullstudy load often is not reflected by the number ofacademic credit units carried. To be considered a full-time student, an under- graduate student must be registered for at least 12units of course work per quarter; and a graduate student must be registered for at least 8 units. A registration of 400 clock hours per quarter is alsoconsidered to be full time for any student. This isbased on forty hours per week for a ten-week quarter. The normal course load, including all course work for which a student may be registered at thisor another institution, is 16 quarter units for anundergraduate student and 12 quarter units for agraduate student. Full-time study loads are thosespecified by the departments for each program.Students of exceptional ability may register for addi-tional course work upon recommendation of thedepartment and consent of the dean. Non-LLU courses as part of total load for financial aid Correspondence, extension, independent study, and course work taken at any other institution con-stitute part of the student's study load. Only whenthe student enrolls in such courses using theConsortium Agreement form (from the Office ofPolicies and General Regulations Students of the School of Allied Health Professions are responsible for informing themselves of and satisfactorily meeting the policies and regulations pertinent toregistration, matriculation, and graduation.34 SCHOOL OF ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONS Financial Aid) will the course(s) count on the stu- dent's total load as eligible for financial-aid and loan-deferment purposes. A person who is not enrolled in regular classes but who is occupied in research, dissertation, or the-sis, is classified as a student. By filing an AcademicLoad Validation form every quarter at registration,the academic load may be validated for loan-defer-ment and immigration purposes. The student mustbe carrying IP (in progress) units or registered for aminimum of 1 new unit of research, dissertation, orthesis for the quarter. The academic work load iscounted as follows: full load\u2014minimum of 36 clock hours/weekthree-quarter load\u2014minimum of 27 hours/week one-half load\u2014minimum of 18 clock hours/week one-quarter load\u2014minimum of 9 clock hours/week. A student may simultaneously earn more than one baccalaureate degree, provided there is a mini-mum of 20 units unique to each degree and providedall other degree requirements are met. Graduate-level courses Seniors who meet prerequisites may, with approval of the instructor and consent of the dean ofthe School of Allied Health Professions and the deanof the school offering the course, enroll for a limitednumber of graduate-level courses (500-level orabove). Only with special permission may credit beapplied to the undergraduate degree, in which casethe credit will not apply toward a graduate degree. Attendance Regular attendance at all appointments (class, clinical, laboratory, special assignment, chapel) isrequired beginning with the first day of each term.Voluntary absences from laboratory assignments are not permitted. Special examination It is expected that the student will take quizzes and examinations at the regularly scheduled time.To take an examination at a time other than when it is scheduled, the student must secure the consent ofthe instructor and the chair of the department andmust file with the instructor a permit obtained fromthe Office of the Dean. A fee is charged for a specialexamination. (See the Schedule of Charges in theFinancial Information section of this BULLETIN .) Academic residence In order to graduate from Loma Linda Univer- sity with a bachelor's degree, a student must com-plete at least 32 of the last 48 units, or a minimumof 45 total units of course work, at this University. Aminimum grade of C (2.0) or better is required forall B.S. and postbaccalaureate degrees. Leave of absence A student who requires a temporary dis- continuance of studies must request in writing aleave of absence after one quarter's absence. Themaximum term for a leave is one year. A studentwho is not registered after one quarter's absence(summer excluded in most cases) and has notrequested a leave of absence will be considered no longer in the program. In this case the student whoseeks re-entry must meet the entrance requirementsin force at the time of re-entrance and will enterunder the new BULLETIN . PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS It is important that students portray a professionalimage to those with whom they come in contact. Inappropriate dress, grooming, or conduct oftendetracts from patients' confidence in the quality oftheir care. In addition, Loma Linda University's affil-iating hospitals have standards that are reflected inthe guidelines below. For these reasons the followingstandards are provided. Students are required toadhere to these standards while enrolled in the pro-gram. A student failing to observe these dress and grooming codes may be dismissed by a faculty mem-ber from a class or building. Students will be allowedto return to the class/building when the problem iseliminated. Personal grooming Good taste indicates that haircuts, hairstyling, and personal grooming be neat, and conservativerather than ostentatious. Grooming and style shouldalso be practical, so that the student can performassigned duties without embarrassment or inconve-nience. Specifically: Men's hair must be neatly trimmed and not fall below the collar. Ponytails, spikes, and dread-locks are not acceptable. Mustaches and beards, if worn, must be neat and closely trimmed. Women's hair, if long, may be required to be tied back. Spikes and dreadlocks are notacceptable. The wearing of hats indoors is not acceptable. Words, pictures, and/or symbols displayed on clothing should be consistent with a Christianinstitution and sensitive to a diverse studentpopulation. Excessive makeup and fragrances are not appropriate. Rings, if worn, should be low profile and limited to one finger per hand. Male students are notallowed to wear ear ornaments. If worn bywomen, ear ornaments are limited to simplestuds and should not drop below the bottom ofthe earlobes. Such ornaments are limited to oneper ear. Rings or ornaments in other anatomi-cal sites are not acceptable. Fingernails should be maintained in a profes- sional manner, closely trimmed, and should notinterfere with patient safety and comfort duringtreatments. Nail polish, if worn, should be of asubdued color. General attire Modest, casual wear is appropriate on campus and in class. Shorts must be neat and at least mid-thigh in length. Bare feet, bare midriffs, low neck-lines, or skin-tight clothing are not acceptable.POLICIES AND GENERAL REGULATIONS 35 Laboratory attire For many classes, students will have to \"dress down\" for laboratories. Instructors will specifyappropriate attire, which is to be worn only for labo-ratories and is not appropriate in other classrooms,on the main floor of Nichol Hall, or in any clinicalfacility. Clinical attire Professional dress is required for all clinical assignments, chapel attendance, any class that isheld in a clinical facility, and any class wherepatients are present. Professional dress includes:skirts /dresses of modest length or long pants (dresspants are recommended\u2014no jeans), closed-toeshoes, and name tags. Laboratory coats may berequired in some clinical settings. Conduct Students are expected to conduct themselves in a professional manner during didactic and clinicaltraining. Professional conduct includes (but is notlimited to) punctuality; and respect for other people,their property, and their right to learn. It alsoincludes an appropriate respect for those in authori-ty. Students of Loma Linda University are expectedto behave in a manner that will not bring criticismupon themselves, the School, or the University.Because students may be exposed to patients' rela-tives and friends in any public place, and becausetheir conversation and their attitudes have an effecton those around them, students are asked to observethe following: Any information given to the student by a patient or contained in a medical record mustbe held in strict confidence. Therefore, the dis-cussion of a patient's diagnosis and treatmentand other clinically related topics should beextremely guarded. A patient's family and com-munity people may be listening and may incor-rectly interpret the things discussed. Carelesstalk may lead to malpractice litigation. A joking or casual attitude toward illness and medical treatment should not be displayedsince it may seem uncaring and be disturbing tothose who are ill and suffering, as well as to thefamily members. Student and staff behavior in the professional situation may be the deciding influence for oragainst Christian beliefs, values, and a health-enhancing lifestyle. SPECIAL COURSE WORK/CREDIT Correspondence course As a general rule, the student may not register for a correspondence course that duplicates a courseoffered at the University. If the student is a candi-date for graduation, the course must be completed amonth before graduation. Information and applica-tion forms for Griggs University Home StudyInternational (the Seventh-day Adventist correspon-dence school) in Washington, D.C., may be obtainedat the Office of University Records.Extension study To be acceptable for credit, an extension course must be evaluated as to its equivalence to an accept-ed course. Registration for it requires the approval ofthe department chair and the consent of the dean. Independent study Independent study may be undertaken subject to the consent of the department chair. The studentis responsible for completion of theDirected/Independent Study Title Request form inaddition to the regular registration. Credit is normal-ly limited to 2 units during the program of study.Under special circumstances, more than 2 units maybe taken. The work is to be completed in adequatetime before graduation to allow recording in theOffice of University Records. Waiver/Equivalency A requirement may sometimes be waived on the basis of prior course work, experience, or licen-sure. If certain conditions are met, credit may begiven. In either case, an examination may berequired. An examination in a given subject may be taken only once. The grade for any credit granted isrecorded as an S after the student has earned atleast 12 units of acceptable credit at this Univer-sity.Credit cannot be earned in this way to make up for acourse in which an unsatisfactory grade wasreceived. All examinations must be taken before thelast quarter of the program of study. Requests are made to the dean on the Petition to Obtain Credit by Examination form. There is afee for an examination.

Poly- somnography is used by highly skilled therapists to diagnose patients with this disorder.Students accepted into the program will be graduates of accredited A.S. degree programsin respiratory care who are licensed to practice in the state of California. Classes andclinical rotations will be taken at Loma Linda University Medical Center and Jerry L.Pettis Memorial Veterans Medical Center in Loma Linda, which have two adult sleep cen-ters and one pediatric sleep center currently operating. Students who gain further clinicalexperience will be eligible to sit for the board examination in polysomnography. For more information, please contact the Department of Cardiopulmonary Sciences.CARDIOPULMONARY SCIENCES 69 CARDIOPULMONARY SCIENCES 69 RESPIRATORY CARE Respiratory care is an allied health profession that promotes health and improve- ment in the cardiopulmonary function of people with heart and lung abnormalitiesand disease. Newborn, pediatric, adult, and elderly patients are treated for a wide range of problems\u2014infant respiratory distress syndrome; trauma; cardiopulmonary arrest;conditions brought on by shock; postoperative surgical and respiratory dis-eases such as pneumonia, asthma, cystic fibrosis, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema. The respiratory care practitioner is a member of the health care team in medical cen- ters, skilled-nursing facilities, outpatient rehabilitation programs, physician offices, and in-home care. Many are involved in research and development of new and innovative careand equipment. They are effective communicators and compassionate caregivers, possess-ing an awareness of cultural sensitivity and diversity. They have leadership roles in patienteducation, wellness intervention, and development of respiratory care plans. Respiratorycare professionals apply critical-thinking skills in cardiopulmonary diagnostics and patientassessment to optimize decision making and delivery of patient care. In a time of high tech-nology, increasing growth of the elderly population, and increasing numbers of patientswith asthma and chronic lung disease, there is a greater demand for educated and skilledrespiratory care practitioners.

The primary concern of both therapist and assistant is to stimulate those changes in behavior patterns that will increase the patient's personal independence and ability to work within his/her cultural and personal milieu. To accomplish this goal, the occupational therapist evaluates the patient; sets up treatment goals; and works together with theoccupational therapy assistant in selecting tasks from the gamut of normal daily self-careactivities, using them to assist the patient in gaining independent-living skills regardlessof disability or handicap. Essential to the role of occupational therapy is an interest in the behavioral sciences and a concern for the individual's need to find proper adjustments to life's circumstances.A desire to teach and a background or interest in medical science are beneficial. Thoseinclined to mechanical or scientific techniques are suited to helping patients developtheir capacities for employment. Others find that they can use their interests in creativearts, crafts, music, and teaching to work with disabled homemakers, children, and retiredpersons. OPPORTUNITIES Occupational therapists and occupational therapy assistants practice in generalhospitals, rehabilitation centers, pediatric or psychiatric clinics, schools, skilled-nursing facilities, home care, and outpatient community-centered programs (including hand-rehabilitation, work-evaluation, and adult day-care facilities).

Theseare: the Del E. Webb Memorial Library, includ- ing the Jorgensen Learning Resources, the Jesse Medical Library and Information Center, and the Veterans Administration Library Services. In addition to these facilities, specialized libraries are located in various medical and schooldepartments on campus. Central library The Del E. Webb Memorial Library is the cen- tral library of Loma Linda University. Its historicalroots go back to 1907, when a small library collec-tion was started in a room of the old Loma LindaSanitarium. In 1953 the growing collection wasmoved to its own building on the Loma Lindacampus. Then in 1981, a new library building wasbuilt from a grant by the Del E. Webb Foundation,giving the library a total floor space of 87,670square feet. This structure now houses the mainlibrary, while the old structure is now sharedbetween the Department of Archives and SpecialCollections and the bound retrospective journals.According to<http://www.llu.edu/llu/library/about/libstats2001-2002.htm> as of June 2002, the library has: 31 databases; and a total of 335,848 books, bound and current journals/periodicals, and media items,including: 156,041 monographic titles (print); and 6,138 journals (print and electronic). Library mission The mission of the Library is to stimulate and support the information needs of theUniversity's instructional, research, and serviceprograms. To this end the Library provides a fullrange of information-support services, including,but not limited to, reference, circulation, reserve, access to the Internet, and hundreds of onlinedatabases, e.g., full-text, automatic, selective dis-semination of center; class-integrated library-instruction programs; and services that supportdistance education and University outreach programs. Worldwide access The Library provides access to other collec- tions worldwide using Internet technologies. Italso participates in a number of national andregional networks. One of these is the NationalNetwork of the Libraries of Medicine, founded bythe National Library of Medicine. This structure isdivided into eight regional sections, one of whichis the Pacific Southwest Region. The Del E. WebbMemorial Library belongs to this region and is thedesignated medical resource library for SanBernardino and Riverside counties. Local librarycooperatives include the IEALC (Inland EmpireAcademic Library Cooperative) and SIRCULS(San Bernardino, Inyo, Riverside Counties UnitedLibrary Services). Membership in these coopera-tives gives our students, faculty, and staff accessto the collections of these libraries. Archives and special collections The Department of Archives and Special Collections is the central repository of informa-tion on the history of Loma Linda University, thehealth sciences, and major collections onAdventism. In addition to print materials thatinclude rare books, theses, and dissertations,there are microforms, sound recordings, and sev-eral thousand photographs. Searchable digitizedindexes for various document files are also avail-able via the Library's web site.
