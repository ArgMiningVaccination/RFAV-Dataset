Failure to access healthcare is an important contributor to child mortality in these settings. Barriers to access have been widely studied, however effective interventions to overcome barriers and increase access to services for children are less well documented. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of effectiveness of interventions aimed at increasing access to health services for children aged 5 years and below in LMIC. Four databases (EMBASE, Global Health, MEDLINE, and PSYCINFO) were searched in January 2016. Studies were included if they evaluated interventions that aimed to increase: health care utilisation; immunisation uptake; and compliance with medication or referral. Randomised controlled trials and non-randomised controlled study designs were included in the review. A narrative approach was used to synthesise results. Results: Fifty seven studies were included in the review. Approximately half of studies (49%) were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa. Most studies were randomised controlled trials ( n= 44; 77%) with the remaining studies employing non-randomised designs. Very few studies were judged as high quality. Studies evaluated a diverse range of interventions and various outcomes. Supply side interventions included: delivery of services at or closer to home and service level improvements (eg. integration of services). Demand side interventions included: educational programmes, text messages, and financial or other incentives. Interventions that delivered services at or closer to home and text messages were in general associated with a significant improvement in relevant outcomes. A consistent pattern was not noted for the remaining studies. Conclusions: This review fills a gap in the literature by providing evidence of the range and effectiveness of interventions that can be used to increase access for children aged 5 years in LMIC. It highlights some intervention areas that seem to show encouraging trends including text message reminders and delivery of services at or close to home. However, given the methodological limitations found in existing studies, the results of this review must be interpreted with caution.

BMC Health Services Research (2017) 17:252 DOI 10.1186/s12913-017-2180-9Background The problem, condition, or issue The substantial gap between the need for health care and the level of access in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC) is well established. In 2015, the World Health Organisation (WHO) estimated that 5.9 million deaths occurred in children under 5 years of age, with a disproportionate concentration of deaths occurring in LMICs [1]. More than half of child deaths worldwide can be prevented through ac- cess to simple and affordable interventions [2 -4]. However, coverage and access to these interventions remains low in LMIC, particularly among the poor- est groups [3]. Since the 1978 Alma Ata declaration expressed the need for action to ensure \"Health for All \"by the year 2000, many resolutions and goals have been endorsed with the ultimate objective of achieving what is now known as Universal Health Coverage (UHC) [5 -9]. UHC is defined as \"ensuring that all people have ac- cess to needed promotive, preventive, curative and re- habilitative health services, of sufficient quality to be effective, while also ensuring that people do not suffer fi- nancial hardship when paying for these services \"[10]. Despite progress made towards achieving UHC and re- markable health gains, evidence suggests that many chil- dren in LMIC are still not accessing needed health care services [3, 6]. The benefits of increasing health coverage go beyond prevention of deaths in children. Delayed or lack of ac- cess to health services for children can lead to a worsen- ing of health, which, in turn, can negatively impact their ability to attend school, social interaction and quality of life [11]. Further, the economic impact on the caregiver can be substantial, through lost days of work, and higher long term health care costs, ultimately contributing to poverty [12]. There are many contributing factors to the under- utilisation of effective health interventions in LMIC [13]. Children may experience particular barriers as they are often dependent on a parent or caregiver to access services. Barriers may arise on the demand side, through individual, household or community level factors, or the supply side, through health sys- tems characteristics [14, 15]. According to the widely recognised conceptual framework by Peters et al. (2008) healthcare access can be considered as involv- ing the following four dimensions, each with a supply and demand component, and these need to be con- sidered when devising strategies to overcome barriers to care [12, 14]: 1.Geographical accessibility: relates to the physical distance and/or travel time from the health serviceto the user. If services are concentrated in particular areas and inadequate provision is available in others (e.g. in poor, rural areas) this imposes a geographic barrier [ 15]. 2.Availability of health care: relates to the ability to access the right care at the right time. This element includes factors such as the hours of operation of a service, the availability of specialist staff, and waiting times that meet the user 's demand for services. 3.Financial accessibility : refers to affordability to access a service that depends on costs and prices of services, and user 's resources and willingness to pay. This also includes the indirect costs such as opportunity costs of time of both the patient and those accompanying them. 4.Acceptability : is dependent on the characteristics and structure of health services matching the needs and expectations of the users as well as individual user 's knowledge and attitudes. The dimensions of Peters 'framework are not mutu- ally exclusive and may interact with each other. Thus, strategies to improve health care access can either be simple, targeting just one d imension (e.g. improving local availability of health services) or complex, in- corporating multiple int eracting components [16]. For example, geographical accessibility can be im- proved by better transportation, which would then depend on financial accessibility, i.e., the ability of users to pay for the transport. Furthermore, Jacobs 'et al. (2012) extended Peters 'framework highlighting that interventions to increase health care access can target supply or demand side and can be financial or non-monetary [14]. While many studies have explored and identified a range of barriers to accessing health care, the evidence for the effectiveness of appropriate interventions to over- come these barriers and increase access to health care for children is unclear [13]. A limited number of previ- ous reviews have focussed on specific intervention types (e.g. cash transfers [17], and pay for performance [18]), however these reviews did not specifically focus on chil- dren in LMIC. Identifying strategies that aim to increase health care access for children and understanding their effectiveness is key for informing policy and the imple- mentation of appropriate evidenced based interventions for this group [17 -21]. We conducted a systematic review of interventions to increase access to health services among children aged 5 years LMIC. The specific objectives were to: /C15Identify and describe the different strategies used to increase access to health care servicesBright et al. BMC Health Services Research (2017) 17:252 Page 2 of 19/C15Evaluate the effectiveness of the strategies used to increase access to health care services The systematic review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement [22]. Methods Procotol and registration The study protocol is registered with PROSPERO Inter- national prospective register of systematic reviews (regis- tration number: CRD420160334200). Study eligibility criteria Studies with the following characteristics were included in the review: Types of participants Studies were included if children aged 5 years were the main recipients of the intervention or if the intervention was directed at carers and/or health professionals (e.g. text message reminders) but the outcome (e.g. child immunization) was aimed at children. We focussed on children 5 years and under because they form a distinct group with unique health needs. Types of interventions According to the Peters 'and Jacobs 'frameworks, we in- cluded supply- and demand- side interventions that sought to increase access to health care for children. Ac- cess to health care was defined for the purposes of this review as the receipt of health care among people who could potentially benefit from it and included health promotion, disease prevention, diagnosis, care for epi- sodic and chronic illness, and rehabilitation services [4]. Packages of interventions were included as long as at least one component aimed to increase health care ac- cess for children. Interventions promoting breastfeeding were not included. Types of outcome measures We included studies that reported on at least one of the following outcome measures for children: /C15Health care utilisation: e.g. proportion of children taken to health facility in event of illness, uptake of early infant diagnosis of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) /C15Immunisation uptake: e.g. coverage of Diphtheria, Pertussis, and Tetanus (DPT) vaccination, measles vaccination /C15Compliance with medication/referrals e.g. intermittent preventative treatment for malaria, adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART)Types of study We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for which the unit of randomisation was cluster or individ- ual, and non-randomised controlled study (NRS) in- cluding non-randomised control trials (non-RCT), controlled before and after studies, quasi RCTs, histor- ically controlled studies and interrupted-time-series studies. Study designs were defined using the Cochrane Handbook [23]. Information sources Four databases (EMBASE, Global Health, MEDLINE, and PSYCINFO) were searched in January 2016. The search strategy comprised five concepts: population; intervention-settings; interv ention-strategies; study de- sign; and country. Search terms were developed using MeSH (see Appendix 1). The search was limited to include all literature up to December 2015. No limits were placed on language. Reference lists of included studies were inspected in order to further identify relevant studies. Furthermore, studies included in any relevant systematic reviews were reviewed for rele- vance. Finally, if any study protocols were identified, a search was made to determine whether the results of the study had been published. Search The strategy used for the EMBASE database is shown in Appendix 1. This strategy was applied across all data- bases; however, it was adapted to fit the relevant subject headings for the particular database. Study selection All studies identified through the search process were exported to a bibliographic database (EndNote version X7) for removal of duplications and screening. Three re- view authors (TB, SP, and HK) independently examined the titles, abstracts, and keywords of electronic records according to the eligibility criteria. One author examined all titles and abstracts (TB), whilst the remaining records were divided between two authors (SP, HK) for double screening. Results of the initial screening were compared and full-text records obtained for all potentially relevant studies. Two review authors (TB and SP) screened the full texts using eligibility criteria for final inclusion in the systematic review. Any disagreements in the selec- tion of the full text for inclusion were resolved by dis- cussion with a third author (HK). Data extraction and analysis Data were extracted into a Microsoft Excel database de- veloped for the purposes of this review. The first author (TB) extracted all data and this was independently checked by a second author (SP).Bright et al. BMC Health Services Research (2017) 17:252 Page 3 of 19Data were extracted on the following study components: 1. Publication details: author, year and journal. 2. Methods: study design and duration. 3. Study location: including country and setting (urban/rural). 4. Participants: age, sex and sample size. 5. Interventions: details on the intervention and its comparator. 6. Outcomes: type of outcome(s), measurement instruments, and time points measured. 7. Results: including relevant measure of effect (odds ratio, risk ratio, p values). 8. Targeted barrier: the interventions were classified according to the barriers to access that they addressed using the Peters 'conceptual framework. In classifying the effectiveness of the interventions, study results were classified as \"positive \"if there was a statistically significant improvement in the outcome(s) of interest (health care utilisation, immunisation uptake and/or compliance outcomes) in the intervention group relative to the comparison group. Studies which found a statistically significant decrease in the outcome(s) rela- tive to the comparison group were classified as \"nega- tive \". If there was no statistically significant change in the outcome of interest, studies were classified as \"null \". Finally, studies measuring multiple outcomes were clas- sified as \"mixed positive \"if there was a significant im- provement in at least one outcome and no significant change in other outcomes and \"mixed negative \"if find- ings were a mix of negative and null. A narrative approach was used to synthesise results in line with the recommendations for systematic reviews of complex interventions [24]. We did not conduct a meta- analysis due to the variation in included study designs, intervention types and outcomes. Risk of bias in individual studies Two authors (TB, SP) independently assessed the meth- odological quality of the selected studies. Disagreements were resolved through discussion. For randomised con- trol trials, we used the Cochrane 'Risk of Bias 'tool [25]. For non-randomised studies, we used the Effective Pub- lic Health Practice Project (EPHPP) quality assessment tool for quantitative studies [26]. Results Study selection A total of 11,031 records were initially identified by the electronic searches, of which 1037 were duplicates and removed. A further 9,882 re cords were excluded during the initial screening yielding 164 potentially eligiblestudies for which full text reports were sought. Follow- ing the full text review, 114 studies were excluded and the full text could not be located for 2 articles [27, 28]. An additional 13 studies were identified through screening reference lists of the included publications, yielding a total of 63 publications for inclusion in the review. Five of these were duplicate publications on the same study and these were grouped together leaving a total of 57 included studies. Figure 1 shows the PRISMA flow chart. Study characteristics A summary of the study characteristics of the in- cluded studies is shown in Table 1. Studies were published between 1996 and 2015 (Fig. 2). The ma- jority of studies were published from 2010 onwards (n= 40; 70%). Study duration ranged from 3 months to 6 years. Approximately half of the studies ( n= 28, 49%) were conducted in Sub-Saharan Africa, 21 (37%) in South Asia, four (7%) in Latin America/Caribbean, three (5%) in East Asia/Pacific, and one (2%) in the Middle East/North Africa. More than half of the studies ( n= 34, 59%) were conducted in rural or semi-rural locations, 14 (25%) were carried out in urban or peri-urban centres and 9 (16%) were car- ried out in a combination of settings (eg. urban and rural). The majority of studies ( n= 44; 77%) were RCTs. The ( n= 1; 2%). Participants The sample size of 39 studies which reported outcomes for individual participants ranged from 180 to 12,326 children with a median of 1205 and combined total of 70,900. The remaining 18 studies reported on the num- ber of households, villages, health centre or births/preg- nancy outcomes. Outcome types Of the 57 included studies; 27 (47%) reported health care utilisation outcomes, 20 (35%) reported on im- munisation, 2 (4%) studies reported compliance out- comes and 8 (14%) studies reported on multiple outcomes (e.g. health service utilisation and compli- ance). Additional file 1 highlights the specific outcomes measured for each study. Risk of bias within studies A total of 44 included studies used a RCT design (either cluster RCT or RCT). The majority of studiesBright et al. BMC Health Services Research (2017) 17:252 Page 4 of 19(n= 40; 90%) were judged as having an unclear risk of bias in at least one of the six domains (sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of out- come assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting and other bias). The remaining studies, 4 (10%) were judged as having a high risk of bias. The domains most commonly contributing to high bias risk were lack of blinding of outcome assessors, in- complete outcome data and 'other 'biases such as re- call bias and use of self-reported data to ascertain vaccination status or health care utilisation (see Ap- pendix 2). Most of the 13 NRS studies were assessed to be of moderate quality (i.e. weak in one domain) (n= 8), and strong quality ( n=1 ) , a n d t h e r e m a i n i n g 4 were judged as weak using the EPHPP tool. The main sources of bias in NRS studies were studydesign, presence of confounders, and withdrawals or dropouts (Appendix 2). Description of studies Comparison group The vast majority of studies ( n= 44; 77%) compared in- terventions to standard care/usual services. Six studies (10%) applied a simplified version of the intervention to the control group [29 -31]. One study (2%) compared two different treatment methods [32]. Three studies (6%) compared two different intervention delivery modes [33 -36]. One study (2%) used historical controls [37]. In two studies, both intervention and control groups received part of an intervention (e.g. systems strengthening) and only the intervention group received the main component of the intervention (3%) [38, 39].Fig. 1 Flow chart of search resultsBright et al. BMC Health Services Research (2017) 17:252 Page 5 of 19Type of interventions The interventions identified in this review were grouped into broadly similar categories and into supply-side or demand-side and non-monetary and financial categories according to the Jacobs 'frame- work [14]: /C15Supply side: non-financial Delivery of services at or closer to home (n=7)[32,33,36,40-43]: including delivery of immunisation, medication/treatment, and referrals by health care professionals, community health workers (CHW), and immunisation campsService level improvements ( n=8 ) [30,34, 44-50]: including health worker training, scaling up services, and integration of services /C15Supply side: financial Service level improvements ( n=2 ) [51,52]: including contracting in or out of services, and pay for performance /C15Demand side: non-financial Health promotion/education programmes (n= 23) [11,31,38,39,53-72]:delivered by varying personnel including health workers, CHW, and participatory women 'sg r o u p s Text messages ( n=5 ) [37,73-76]: including text message reminders, and promotion of service /C15Demand side: financial Financial or other incentives ( n= 12) [77-90]: including cash transfers, vouchers, fee exemptions and food incentives Some studies evaluated interventions with demand- and supply-side components (combined interventions) and these were allocated to one of the above categor- ies according to their primary component for sim- plicity. With regards to Peters 'framework, 49% of studies used interventio ns that targeted more than one dimension of access ( n= 28), with the remaining targeting a single dimension. A summary description of all the interventions in the included studies is pro- v i d e di nT a b l e s2a n d3 . Effectiveness of interventions The effectiveness of the interventions is summarised by intervention type: Supply-side; non-financial Delivery of services close to home A ss h o w ni nT a b l e2 ,t h es e v e ns t u d i e si nt h i sg r o u p included interventions delivered by health profes- sionals [41, 42], CHW immunisation camp [40]. In total five (71%) of the seven studies showed a statistically significant im- provement in uptake in the outcome measures of interest (health care utilisation, immunisation and/or compliance outcomes), one ( 14%) had mixed-positive significance (i.e. significant improvement and no significant change on at least one outcome measure respectively) and one (14%) had no significant im- pact on any of the outcome measures of interest (null effect) (Fig. 3; Additional file 1). There were no clear trends in intervention effectiveness between the different delivery modes (e.g. health professional or CHWs).Table 1 Characteristics of included studies Variable Number Percent Location Urban or periurban 14 25 Rural or semi rural 34 59 Mixed 9 16 Decade of publication 1990 2 4 2000 15 26 2010 40 70 Study design RCT 44 77 Non-RCT 2 4 Controlled before-after study 8 14 Historical controlled study 2 4 Interrupted time series 1 2 Region Latin America/Caribbean 4 7 East Asia/Pacific 3 5 Sub-Saharan Africa 28 49 South Asia 21 37 Middle East/North Africa 1 2 Outcome category Immunisation 20 35 Health care utilisation 27 47 Compliance 2 4 Combination 8 14 Intervention category Delivery of services closer to or at home 7 12 Health promotion/education programme 23 40 Service level improvements 10 18 Text messages 5 9 Financial or other incentives 12 21Bright et al. BMC Health Services Research (2017) 17:252 Page 6 of 19Service level improvements There were eight studies eva luating service level im- provements which included health care worker training [30, 44, 46], scaling up of services [47] and integration of services such as HIV and immunisation services [34, 45, 48 -50]. Overall, three of these studies were classi- fied as positive (37.5%), three as mixed-positive (37.5%) a n dt w oa sn u l l2 5 % )( F i g .3 ;A d d i t i o n a lf i l e1 ) .T h e r e was some variation in effectiveness between the specific intervention approaches: the two health worker training interventions showed a significant improvement in all (n=1 ) o r i n a t l e a s t o n e ( n= 1) of the outcomes of interest (mixed-positive significance). Two of the three studies evaluating service integration were posi- tive [34, 45], and one showed null effect. One study assessed scaling up services and found no significant impact on immunization coverage [47]. Two studies within this group were evaluated inter- ventions with more than one component (combined interventions). In one such study, health worker training was conducted alongside health systems im- provements, and family and community level activ- ities and showed mixed-positive results [44]. The other study combined integration of HIV and immun- isation services, operationa l support, caregiver coun- selling and community awareness campaigns and found null effect on health care utilisation and im- munisation uptake [91]. Supply-side; financial Service level improvements Two studies were identified that evaluated financial service level improvements (Table 2). A cluster RCTstudy of pay for performance for health care workers showed a significant improvement in health care utilisa- tion and no significant impact on immunization cover- age (mixed-positive) [51]. A non-randomised trial evaluated delivery of primary health services by a con- tractor but the results were unclear [52]. Demand-side; non-financial Health promotion/education programmes Health education/promotion programmes were the most frequently evaluated intervention identified in this review ( n= 23) (Table 3). Four educational inter- ventions were delivered by health professionals (nurses or doctors) and addressed immunization and childhood infections [11, 58, 70, 71]. In 11 studies, education of families and caregivers by CHW was provided on a variety of topics including: newborn care, antenatal care and vaccinations [29, 31, 38, 54 - 57, 62, 63, 65, 68, 72]. Women 's participatory learning groups that aimed to identify maternal and neonatal problems and strategies to improve these were evalu- ated in five studies [39, 59, 61, 64, 66, 69]. In the remaining three studies, educational programmes on topics including vaccinations and newborn care were delivered by another member of the community (e.g. teacher or peer) [53, 60, 67]. Overall, 8 of the 23 (35%) educational interventions were associated with a positive effect, five (22%) were m i x e d - p o s i t i v ea n dt e n( 4 3 % )s h o w e dn u l le f f e c t (Fig. 3). Three of the health worker delivered educa- tional interventions had either a positive or mixed- positive impact and one showed null effect. Results of studies where education was delivered by CHWs,Fig. 2 Year of publication of included studiesBright et al. BMC Health Services Research (2017) 17:252 Page 7 of 19teachers, peers, or counsellors were more varied (Table 3; Additional file 1). None of the five studies evaluating women 'sg r o u p sa sas t a n d a l o n ei n t e r v e n - tion found a significant improvement in our outcomes of interest. Further, one study combined women 's groups with health systems strengthening and staff training and found no effect [39]. Of the seven studies that evaluated health education delivered by a CHW, the majority found null effect (n= 4; 57%), one (14%) was positive, and two (26%) were mixed-positive. A further three studies combinedhealth education delivered by a CHW with other components. Positive results were seen when CHW education was combined with either: health systems strengthening, or community development [54, 92]. However, when CHW education was combined with both strengthening of health systems and women 's groups, no effect was seen [65]. Text messages Five studies evaluated text messages reminders or promotion of a health care service (Table 3).

BMC Health Services Research (2017) 17:252 Page 9 of 19of these studies evaluated text reminders for attending ser- vices for early infant diagnosis of HIV [37]; HIV care [74]; and vaccination [73, 76]. Of these studies, three were posi- tive and one was mixed-positive (Fig. 3) [76]. Another intervention, which provided HIV related health promo- tion via text, was also positive [75]. Demand-side; financial Financial or other incentives Financial interventions were the second most com- mon intervention category identified in this review (n= 12) (Table 3). A range of interventions weretested: unconditional or conditional cash transfers [78, 82, 84, 86, 87, 90, 92], fee exemptions [77, 79, 80, 88, 89], and food incentive schemes [83, 85]. One third of studies in this group were positive, one third found mixed-positive results, and a third showed null effect (Fig. 3). Specifically, studies evaluating food incentive schemes all found a positive impact ( n= 2). Studies evaluating removal of user fees alone were either positive ( n= 1) or mixed positive ( n= 1). In addition, fee exemptions in combination with social mobilisation, education, and strengthening of services, a positive impact was found on health care utilisation [93].Table 3 Description of interventions of included studies, grouped according to demand-side and non-financial and financial (P = positive; MP = mixed positive; N = negative) (Continued) referral systems (including provision of free care and referrals) Home visits by CHWs, training in improved case management of sick children, women 's groups, strengthening of health systemsN[ 65] Text messages Early infant diagnosis P [ 37] HIV appointment reminders P [ 74] Vaccination P MP Text messages providing health promotion for HIVP Fig. 3 Summary results of included studies by intervention typeBright et al. BMC Health Services Research (2017) 17:252 Page 10 of 19Results from cash transfer interventions (4 null and 2 mixed) were more varied (Table 3; Additional file 1). When conditional cash transfers were combined with health services strengthening, null effect was seen [84]. When combined with health services strengthening and a community based nutrition programme, mixed positive results were seen [87]. Combined interventions A total of nine studies were considered to evaluate interventions with multiple components. These stud- ies combined demand and supply side interventions for example health education together with health systems strengthening. Although they included differ- ent interventions, most of these studies had a primary component which we used to assign to the relevant intervention groups in this review (see Tables 2 and 3). Overall, 44% of combined interventions had a pri- mary component of health education, one third had a financial or other incentive component ( n=3 ) , a n d 22% combined service level strengthening with other components ( n= 2). Of the two combined interven- tions classified as supply-side which combined service level improvements with community components such as awareness campaigns, one found null effect on the outcomes of interest and the other had mixed positive results [44, 91]. Considering the seven com- bined interventions classified on the demand side, 43% ( n= 3) were positive [54, positive ( n= 1) and remaining 43% found null effect ( n= 3) [39, 65, 84].The effectiveness of the interventions is also sum- marised by outcome type: Health care utilisation: Of studies evaluating the impact of supply side interventions on health care utilisation, 56% had a positive effect (null 22%; and mixed-positive 22%). For the demand side interventions, 42% of the studies were positive, (null: 35%; and mixed-positive results 23%) (Fig. 4). Immunisation uptake: Of studies evaluating immunisation uptake, 44% of studies targeting the supply side were positive, 44% showed no effect, and the remaining 11% found mixed-positive significance. On the demand side, results were more varied; 33% found evidence of improved immunisation uptake, 50% found null effect, and 17% found mixed-positive significance. Compliance outcomes: Of studies measuring compliance outcomes, 33% of studies targeting supply-side factors were positive, 33% found mixed-positive significance, and 33% found negative results. The study with interventions targeting the demand side was positive (100%). These results are summarised in Fig. 4. Note that some studies measured more than one of these out- comes, and hence the denominator for the percent- ages is based on the number of outcomes rather than study.

BMC Health Services Research (2017) 17:252 Page 11 of 19Discussion To the best of our knowledge, this is the first com- prehensive systematic review of interventions to in- crease access to health care with a specific focus on children in LMIC. The review was large, comprising 63 peer-reviewed articles from 57 studies. The review identified the following six broad groups of interven- tions that aim to increase access to health services f o rc h i l d r e ni nL M I C ,b o t ho nt h ed e m a n d - s i d ea n d supply-side: /C15Supply side; non-financial Delivery of services close to home Service level improvements /C15Supply side; financial Service level improvements /C15Demand side; non-financial Health promotion/education Text message reminders /C15Demand side; financial Financial or other incentives The interventions identified in this review target different dimensions of health care access, as char- acterised by the Peters 'and Jacobs 'frameworks, both on the supply and demand side. On the supply side, delivery of services at or closer to home (by nurses, CHWs, school programmes or camps) target both geographical barriers and financial barriers by reducing the travel and opportunity costs associated with attending health services. Interventions de- signed to improve health services tackle issues of acceptability and availability aiming to increase quality services that meet the needs and expectations of users. On the demand side, the most common interven- tions identified in this review were health promotion/ educational programmes via different delivery modes addressing acceptability (i.e. aiming to influence user 's knowledge and attitudes), as well as geographical ac- cessibility barriers (i.e. providing health promotion within the home or community). Text message re- minders or health promotion target the acceptability dimension of access through the improving user 's knowledge and attitudes about the service. Finally, a group of interventions target the financial accessibility of services through providing financial assistance, for example cash transfers, vou chers and fee exception, or food incentives conditional on certain health seek- ing behaviours. Evidence on the effectiveness of the interventions included in this review were mixed, even within the different intervention types. The two intervention types most consistently associated with a positiveimprovement in the uptake of health services for chil- dren were the use of text messages (demand side; non-financial) and the delivery of services closer to home (supply-side; non-financial). Supply-side; non-financial interventions Delivery of services close to home In many LMIC settings, health centres are concen- trated in urban areas making it logistically difficult and prohibitively expensive to reach for many people particularly in rural areas [3]. This review suggested that interventions aimed at addressing these geo- graphical and financial accessibility barriers by bring- ing services closer to the home may be beneficial in terms of improving health car e utilisation, immunisa- tion and medication/referr al compliance for children. For example, the use of CHW for delivery of services has been identified as one strategy to address the growing shortage of health workers in LMIC [93, 94]. CHW programmes are likely to im- prove cost-effectiveness of healthcare systems by reaching large numbers of previously underserved people with basic services at low cost. The term \"community health worker \"encompasses a range of community health assistants who are trained to work within the communities from which they come [93, 94]. Given that they are members of the community in which they work, this is thought to increase ac- ceptability of services. Their role may involve provision of preventive or curative treatment or health education programme s. Further primary stud- ies are needed to explore the long term sustainability and cost-effectiveness of these interventions. In addition, while all but one of the studies evaluating interventions that delivered services at or closer to home were RCTs, the quality was generally poor or unclear and therefore some caution in the interpret- ation is warranted. Service level improvements Non-monetary service level improvement interven- tions identified in this review included health worker training, integration of services, and scale up of services. Four studies that evaluated integration of services were identified, tho ught to target availability and acceptability of services. Findings were mixed, aligning with previous work by Briggs et al. (2006) [20]. Health worker training interventions included in this review were designed to target multiple di- mensions of access, primaril y availability, but also acceptability through community mobilisation. Over- all, these interventions were associated with an in- crease in health care utilis ation and immunisation u p t a k e .T h i sa l i g n sw i t hf i n d i n g sf r o mar e v i e wb yBright et al. BMC Health Services Research (2017) 17:252 Page 12 of 19Willey et al. (2013) that found that health worker training had a positive impact on quality of care and coverage of services [95]. Supply-side; financial interventions Service level improvements There were very few studies identified in this review that were classified as supply side financial interven- tions. Those that were identified used pay for perform- ance, tackling availability and acceptability barriers, and contracting, which potentially targets all four bar- riers of access depending on available resources [14]. Health systems strengthening is seen as a global health priority and is particularly relevant for achieving UHC. Thus, further evidence is warranted on the effective- ness of these interventions that tackle inefficiencies within the health system and their impact on access for children. Demand-side; non-financial interventions Health promotion/education Our review found that educational interventions delivered by health care workers generally had a positive impact on health care utilisation or immunization uptake. We did not find evidence of significant im- provements in health access outcomes for children associated with participatory women 's learning groups. This aligns to some extent with a meta- analysis of trials of women 's groups by Prost et al. (2013) which found a non-significant reduction in maternal and neonatal mortality across all the in- cluded trials [96]. However, in a sub-group analysis of 4 studies in which at least 30% of pregnant women participated in the groups found that the reduction in neonatal mortality was significant. Al- though such sub-group analyses were beyond the scope of this current review, this warrants further attention in the context of the impact of participa- tory women 's groups on access to health care for children. Evidence from this review suggested that educational programmes delivered by CHWs was varied. Previous reviews have suggested that this method is associated with improved immunisation uptake, and reduce childhood diarrhoea. [97, 98] The mixed impact on health care access as a result of educational programmes may reflect the broad range of delivery modes and intervention content as well as the variable quality of the studies. In addition, as health education is thought to princi- pally target acceptability barriers, the impact of health promotion on access to health care may be limited if financial and geographical barriers prevent access to health services [14].Text messages With evolving mobile phone technology and rapidly increasing numbers of mobile phone users in LMIC, there is increased interest in the use of this rela- tively low cost technology within health services [99]. The generally positive impact of text messages to remind carers about appointments or send health promotional messages in studies included in this re- view concurs with previous systematic reviews which found mobile phone reminders generally im- proved attendance at health appointments among adults [100], health care outcomes (all ages) [99], and ART adherence among adults [101]. While it is en- couraging that the majority studies of text messages in the current review were RCTs, the study quality was of some concern, echoing previous reviews [99, 100]. Further, all the studies were conducted in Sub- Saharan Africa, thus their generalisability to other set- tings is unclear. The use of text messages is poten- tially promising area for improving health care access for children in LMIC which deserves further atten- t i o n .H o w e v e r ,t h e r ei san e e df o rm o r ee v i d e n c ei n different geographical settings using well designed RCTs. Demand-side; financial interventions Financial or other incentives Financial or other incentives appear to tackle finan- cial accessibility as participants do not incur fees for service or receive food at the health appointment. Conditional cash transfers may in addition tackle geographic accessibility by making money available for transport as well as acceptability through tackling issues of cultural preferences and stigma [14]. Our findings contrast somewhat to a systematic review by Lagarde et al. (2007) of conditional cash transfers for improving uptake of health services in LMIC, which concluded that these programmes are effective in increasing the use of preventive services [17]. However, the authors confirmed the dearth of evi- dence on the topic and many of the studies included were from grey literature sources or used study de- signs that did not meet our inclusion criteria. In addition, the previous review did not have a specific focus on children. Althou g ht h e r ew e r ef e ws t u d i e s , the removal of user fees was associated with a posi- tive or mixed positive outcome. As discussed by Jacobs 'et al. (2012), user fee removal could result in reduced access if increased drug supply is not con- sidered [14]. Combined interventions We delineated the studies identified in the review into the categories above to allow clarity about whichBright et al. BMC Health Services Research (2017) 17:252 Page 13 of 19interventions could be used to tackle different dimen- sions of access. However, it is important to recognise that barriers to accessing health care are rarely con- s t r a i n e dt ot h ed e m a n do rs u p p l ys i d ea l o n e .I ti s likely that both demand and supply side barriers, as well multiple dimensions of access, need to be ad- dressed simultaneously through a 'package 'of inter- ventions in order to maximise the chances of a positive impact on access to health services [14]. Des- pite this, we identified only nine studies which in- cluded interventions with multiple components. Among the combined interventions, our review did not find a consistency positive impact on access. However, there is also evidence to suggest that the ef- fectiveness of intervention combinations depends sub- stantially on the context. [14] For instance, our review identified two similar interventions that com- bined educational interventions delivered by CHW with health systems strengthening. The first study, conducted in Bangladesh, found a positive impact on care seeking for newborn illness, whilst the second, conducted in India, found no effect on this outcome or on the uptake of BCG vaccine [54, 65]. The differ- ences in findings may be due to contextual factors that affect the interventions mechanisms, or the way in which the intervention was implemented in the different settings. The lack of sufficient data on combined interventions may reflect the challenges faced in evaluating them. Fur- ther research into the effectiveness of complex interven- tions that include multiple components is required using guidance from bodies such as the Medical Research Council (MRC) [102]. Recommendations Although the quality of evidence was generally mixed, the review does highlight two intervention areas, in particular, that seem to show encouraging trends and which deserve further attention: text message reminders and delivery of services at or close to home. This review has highlighted a need for further high quality research into the effectiveness of all interven- tion types identified in this review. These studies must be well-designed, conducted in a range of LMIC, and should consider co ntext specific barriers the intervention aims to address. In particular, re- search into combined interventions, should be priori- tised. As many of the interventions identified in the review can be considered as complex, involving sev- eral interacting components and targeting multiple dimensions of access, the use of MRC guidelines for evaluations of complex interventions may be benefi- cial [16]. For example, incl uding process evaluationscan help to understand the mechanisms of impact, both positive and negative, how the intervention was implemented, and contextual factors that shape as- pects of the intervention. This, in turn, may help policy-makers evaluate ho w evidence from a different context could be applied in their setting. Strengths and limitations We adopted a systematic approach to searching, screen- ing, appraising and extracting data checked by two re- viewers. We attempted to minimise citation bias through reviewing references of included studies and relevant systematic reviews. There were some limitations that should be taken into account when interpreting the findings of this review. Although we did not restrict our search in terms of lan- guage, we only used English search terms and few French or Spanish citations were retrieved. Therefore, relevant evidence from francophone Africa and Latin America may have been missed. While the broad nature of our review question was effective in highlighting the range of different intervention approaches it precluded a detailed analysis of each intervention type and potential mechanisms to be theorised and this deserves further attention. We included only peer-reviewed studies that employed RCT, non-RCT, controlled before after study, historically controlled study and interrupted time series designs to reduce risk of important biases. However, interven- tions addressing health care access are often complex and challenging to evaluate using a trial design. For instance, provision of an essential health package which has occurred in many low and middle income countries has not been evaluated in this way. We may therefore have missed interventions of interest evalu- ated using other study designs or published in grey literature. This review did not explore the quality of the interven- tions that were delivered, or the impact on equity and thus warrants further investigation. Finally, the vast ma- jority of studies included in this review did not assess cost-effectiveness of the interventions being studied. Further attention is needed to understand this aspect of these interventions. Conclusions This review fills a gap in the literature by identifying the range and effectiveness of interventions that can be used to increase health care access for children in LMIC. It highlights some intervention areas that seem to show encouraging trends including text message reminders and delivery of services at or close to home.Bright et al.
