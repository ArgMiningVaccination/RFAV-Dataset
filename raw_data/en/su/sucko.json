This is exactly why you'll find Yogis from across the globe starting to consume organic Haritaki powder, and today, we're going to cover three of the most powerful reasons why this unique fruit should be a part of every spiritual beings diet! Here's what you need to Pineal Gland The pineal gland is an organ in the brain that is directly associated to the energy center known as the \"third eye\" or \"ajna chakra\" - the space which Descartes called the \"Seat of the Soul\" and what Hindus view as the Cosmic web-browser center! However, due to the various unconscious societal policies, the modern man's pineal gland becomes calcified into a crystalline structure from the various toxins, pesticides, vaccines and chemicals that enter into our blood stream. Because of the third eye's energetic force, it absorbs these heavy metals and subsequently inhibits its own antenna to Divine states of Consciousness. However, when Haritaki enters into your system it immediately begins to purify the blood of these heavy metals, mercury being one of them. So as we reduce our intake of toxins and ingest small dosages of Haritaki every day, the result is a purified blood stream and cleansed pineal gland - meaning, more intuition, higher intelligence, greater awareness, and more bliss!

Haritaki Helps You Digest Life, Reduce Thoughts and Expand Awareness In the ancient Ayurvedic text, the Charaka Samhita, Haritaki is referred to as \"Sarva Roga Nivarani\", that which heals all diseases. It is an anti-aging elixir because of its impact on your physical and mental bodies. HDH Sri Nithyananda Paramashivam says, \"life is not digested in the head.. it is digested in the stomach.\" This means, whenever we feel stress or anxiety, we feel it in our stomach, in the Manipuraka chakra energy center. But if have a stomach full of unprocessed food, toxins and negative hormones, then the energy center which is supposed to support you in processing the life outside you, becomes overwhelmed and \"short circuits\", eventually leading to mental breakdowns for some. Consuming Organic Haritaki powder helps regulate the digestive system, and allow you to process the challenges of life as they arise. The result more space to be present and aware of our reactionary thought currents. 3. Haritaki Drastically Increases Your Level of Prana (Life-Force Energy) Yogis have used Haritaki for thousands of years to increase the intake of prana (life-force energy) into their body, which elevates you spiritually and energetically, which is one reason why it's said to be the favorite herb of Buddha himself. In Ayurveda, Haritaki is said to be the only substance with the power to move (assimilate) prana through all levels of the body; consuming Haritaki is \"equivalent to 2 hours of pranayama\" - HDH Sri Nithyananda Paramashivam The result of consuming Haritaki regularly, you increase your overall life-energy. You'll find you need less sleep, wake up earlier, become more active and feel an energy source within you that you've otherwise never experienced. Haritaki is infamous for its bitterness, but it follows with a sweet aftertaste, which is why most people prefer to take it in capsule form. That being said, if you can find a high quality source of organic Haritaki like ours at Ananda Ayurveda, then you'll find that the powder is less chalky, more palatable, less bitter, and with a sweeter aftertaste. This is important, because if you can - it's always best to ingest the powder over the capsule! It's important to talk to your doctor or health care practitioner, especially before using haritaki in combination with blood-sugar-lowering drugs (such as diabetes medications). Haritaki should not be used by pregnant women, nursing mothers, children, those who are malnourished/debilitated, those who have lost blood, those with medical conditions, or people who are taking medications without consulting a doctor first.
