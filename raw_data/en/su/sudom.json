I recently had mine and it was truly one of the most magical and special days of my life \u2014 a day I will never forget, and will hold close to my heart forever. The entire experience was fIlled with so much love, support and goodness that I want to share all the details with you. But first... What's the difference between a Mother's Blessing and a Baby Shower? A Mother's Blessing is very different to a traditional baby shower. A traditional baby shower is focused on the baby, and usually involves things like presents for the baby, playing games, and drinking a champagne toast to the new mother. In contrast, a Mother's Blessing focuses on honouring the mother and holding space for her as she embarks on this incredible life changing rite of passage and transitions from maiden to mother. The underlying intention is to fill her with love, strength, support and encouragement as she embarks on this special journey. Like a baby shower, a Mother's Blessing is held pre-birth, and can be organised by friends or by the mama herself. The invite list usually consists of the new mother's soul sisters and other important women in her life. The term 'Blessing Way' is often used to describe these events. A Blessing way is a sacred Navajo ceremony that is unique to their tradition, and out of respect for the Navajo people, we use the term 'Mama Blessing' or 'Mother's Blessing' instead. How To Host A Mother's Blessing Choose A Special Location We hired a house, and my besties and I spent the entire weekend there, which was so lovely (but entirely optional). You can hold your ceremony in a park, at a yoga studio, in someone's lounge room or in your backyard. Almost any space will work, though ideally choose one that has good energy, is quiet, and has loads of natural light. Set The Scene Get everyone to bring a throw and cushion to make the space cosy, or you can do what I did and hire an amazing styling company like [Moon Folk Co](https://www.themoonfolkco.com/) (who also did my [Gender Reveal](https://melissaambrosini.com/pregnancy/gender-reveal/) Celebration) who came and worked their magic to create a beautiful, sacred and special space. You can also get everyone to bring an 'offering' like a flower or a crystal to create a mandala for the centre of the circle. Use your imagination and get creative here. Flowers I LOVE nature, and I think flowers add such a beautiful touch to any event. You can get everyone to bring some flowers or gifts from their garden to create a mandala or to style the tables, or you can get an amazing company like [@myrtleandcofloraldesigns](https://www.instagram.com/myrtleandcofloraldesigns/) to do it for you. I asked them to create some table arrangements, a wall installation and a stunning flower crown, and the results were magical. I felt like a princess wearing my crown and didn't want to take it off. And it's now become a sacred memento \u2014 I will place it on my birth altar when I set it up, and then hang it in my baby girl's room. Sage & Palo Santo As we sat down to begin the ceremony, I got two of my best friends to walk around and cleanse everyone with sage and palo santo. [Here's how you do it.](https://melissaambrosini.com/health/sage-smudging/) This will help cleanse and remove any fears anyone is holding onto so that they can hold space with an open mind and heart and not bring any of their stuff into the space. This is not the time to project your fears, this is the time to hold space for the mama. Alternatively, you could do a 'washing of the feet' ceremony instead, where you have a foot bath filled with warm water, [essential oils](https://melissaambrosini.com/doterra-path-to-wellness-and-path-to-freedom), rose petals and everyone washes the mother's feet first. After that, you all wash your feet one at a time cleaning away any fears before you enter the sacred space. Essential Oils Before we began the ceremony, we passed around [Rose essential oil ](https://melissaambrosini.com/doterra-path-to-wellness-and-path-to-freedom)(which is the oil of love and the oil with the highest vibration), and got everyone to breathe it in and rub it on their heart to open up their heart chakra and fill the space with love. (Also, the smell was divine. It really helped set the scene.) Start With Meditation My bestie Nat opened the circle with a beautiful guided meditation to bring all our energy together. She got everyone to open their heart and visualise sending me and baby girl so much love. They visualized love pouring out of their heart and into mine and hers, it was so beautiful and the energy was incredible. The Crystal Ceremony After the meditation, we began the crystal ceremony. Nat read some words of wisdom about the power of women coming together and supporting each other to raise children. Then they each went around and shared these three things: - How they met me. - What they love most about me. - Their wish for me and baby girl during our birth They did this whilst threading a crystal they had each chosen specifically for me and baby girl, and sharing why they chose that crystal. It was so beautiful and there were many tears of love. Raw Chocolate After the crystal ceremony, we had organic herbal tea from [Edible Beauty](https://ediblebeautyaustralia.com/?gclid=CjwKCAiAhbeCBhBcEiwAkv2cY1BRhlyarMVVi2GYBMJioLvvW70DzwsIiAnetc8zEPG1ejp1X5VVChoCeRIQAvD_BwE) and my all-time favorite raw chocolate from [Loco Love](https://locolove.com/?gclid=CjwKCAiAhbeCBhBcEiwAkv2cY3mf7FXqhqn4JFna3usO80_az_8-bnKOCEzO7-pMz78es9E0B4TYaxoCWUgQAvD_BwE) chocolate whilst we waited for more women to arrive. Red Rope Ceremony We then sat down again and my beautiful friend [Nicole](https://www.instagram.com/nicolejoyinspire/) opened the circle with a sound bowl healing and singing (her voice is magic). After that, another one of my besties [Sally](https://www.instagram.com/sallyjanedouglas/) led the red rope ceremony, which is where a long length of red rope or twine is passed around and each person takes their turn to weave it around their left wrist while sharing a wish for the mama and baby for the birth. By the end, everyone is connected by the red rope, which feels incredibly powerful energetically. Then you cut the rope between each person, and everyone takes their ends and ties them off around their wrist. This potent visual reminder remains on your wrist until the mama goes into labor, which is when everyone cuts the ropes off and says a prayer for the mama and baby, sends them so much love, and reaffirms their intention for her and baby's arrival. To close out this beautiful ritual, Nicole again sang and did a sound bowl healing. It was incredibly moving for everyone, and there were a few tears shed around the circle again, as we all felt the magic and divine sacredness of the moment. The Food Food is such an important part of any event, and I knew I wanted to nourish the women in my life with the most delicious feast possible. The amazing [@_rawbynature_](https://www.instagram.com/_rawbynature_/) catered the food, which was perfect. It was all organic, vegan and ridiculously tasty. Alternatively, you can get everyone to bring some of the mother's favorite dishes to share. Drinks We sipped [@osunsparkling](https://www.instagram.com/osunsparkling/), which is sparkling water that's sugar free, botanically infused, positively charged and intentionally made on the full moon. These drinks are incredible, and we indulged in the Rose, Lavender and Jasmine flavours. Hair & Makeup One of my soul sisters Eva [@evahairsunshinecoast](https://www.instagram.com/evahairsunshinecoast/) is an organic hair and make up artist and she came to the house in the morning. She did mine and my besties' hair and makeup which was such a special touch. Gifts Every single person who was at my blessing means the world to me and gives me so much love and support, so I wanted to gift them with something special to take home. I gave everyone a box from [@hartroks](https://www.instagram.com/hartroks/) which was intentionally created for the day by the amazing girls at Hart Roks, and each one was infused with so much love and intention. I also gave them some intention cards and a journal from [@theintrinsicway ](https://www.instagram.com/theintrinsicway/)\u2014 another company I LOVE and adore. I want them to look at these gifts and be transported back to that day of magic. Capture The Day My beautiful friend, the super talented [@chloetarahhorder.media](https://www.instagram.com/chloetarahhorder.media/), captured both photo and video footage on the day and I will treasure these reminders forever. If you don't have a professional, make sure you delegate one person to capture the magic for you. This truly was one of the most magical days of my life, and I will treasure the memory of it forever.
