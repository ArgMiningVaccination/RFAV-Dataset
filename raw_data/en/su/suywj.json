Communicable Disease EpidemiologyServices, STD/HIV Control and TB Control have contributed tothis combined report. Reportable diseases are organized underthe heading of vaccine preventable diseases, invasive bacterialdiseases, sexually transmitted and blood borne pathogens andenteric, zoonotic and vector-borne diseases. Vaccine Preventable Diseases Seven cases of invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) disease were reported in 2002. Rates have been low since the introduction of the infant conjugate Hib vaccine program in 1993. Three of the cases occurred in children under 5 yearsof age: one in a one month old infant and two in older unimmunized infants. The rate of acute hepatitis B in British Columbia fell to 1.8 per 100,000 population in 2002. 2002 was the second year duringwhich no cases of acute hepatitis B were reported in the 12-20year age-group.Influenza: The peak of ILI activity occurred later than expected, possi- bly because of milder weather conditions. Eight ILI outbreaks in long term care facilities and 231 out-breaks in schools were reported during the season. Only oneoutbreak in a LTCF was confirmed influenza A and several ILIoutbreaks in schools were confirmed influenza B. Of 2191 respiratory specimens received up to week 29,9.8% tested positive for influenza B, 8.2% for influenza A,8.7% for RSV and 1.5% for other viruses. All viruses identified were closely related to the season'svaccine strains. A total of 5 confirmed cases of measles were reported through the enhanced surveillance program. No cases were recognizedto be associated with other Canadian cases. Six cases of mumps were reported in 2002 for a rate of 0.2 per 100,000, the lowest rate recorded in BC and one-quarter of thenational rate reported for that year. The rate of reporting of pertussis in 2002 was virtually identical to that of the year before at 15.5 per 100,000 population. Thepreviously noted pattern of excess rates in 10 - 14 year oldswas again observed in 2002, suggesting that we are still dealingwith a cohort of preadolescent children with poor protectionfrom production lots of vaccine in use during their infancy. Executive Summary 4Only two cases of rubella were reported in BC in 2002, consis- tent with trends since 1997. Congenital rubella syndrome wasreported in an infant born in 2002. There were 32 reports of invasive meningococcal disease in BC during 2002 for a rate of 0.8 per 100,000 population. Most (26)occurred in people over the age of 14. Serogrouping of the 32isolates revealed that 17 (53%) were serogroup B, 8 (25%)serogroup 6 (19%) serogroup Y and 1 (3%) serogroup W135.This represents a decline in serogroup C contribution from the45-50% range seen in 2000 and 2001. In 2002, British Columbia reported 343 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), for a rate of 8.3 per 100,000 population. The preponderance of IPD continues to be seen ininfants and children less than 5 years of age. In 2003, publichealth efforts will be directed toward the implementation of anew pneumococcal conjugate vaccine program. Blood Borne Pathogens and Sexually Transmitted Infections The rate of reporting of new cases of HIVremained the same between 2002 and 2003 at 10.7 per 100,000. The BC rate of AIDS reporting continued to decline to 0.9 per 100,000 population in 1992. The distribution of male cases hasshifted with a drop in the 30-39 age group and an increase inthe 25-29 age group. The BC rate per 100,000 population for reported chlamydia cases in 2002 was 184.2. This is a 29% increase from the rateof 143.2 in 2001. The BC rate per 100,000 population of reported gonorrhea cases in 2002 increased to 17.3 from 14.6 the previous year. The rate per 100,000 population of infectious syphilis increased from 4.3 in 2001 to 4.5 in 2002 as numbers ofcases increased from 178 to 186. Syphilis cases are concen-trated in the Vancouver and lower mainland regions. The rate of reporting of new positive tests for hepatitis C has remained stable over the last three years. Four thousand sixhundred and twenty-five new reports were received in 2002 fora rate of 112 per 100,000 population. 5 2002BC Centre for Disease ControlInvasive Bacterial Infections and Antibiotic Resistant Organisms One hundred and fifty six cases of invasive group A streptococ- cal (GAS) disease were reported in 2002, an increase of thirty- nine percent from the previous year and about twice the report-ed Canadian rate. Necrotizing fasciitis was reported in 21 (14%)of cases and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome in 12 (8%) ofcases. In 2002 there were 303 cases of reported tuberculosis for a rate of 7.3 per 100,000 in British Columbia, a 23% decrease inthe number and rate of reported cases compared to 2001. This report includes a section on laboratory based surveillance for Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Vancomycin Resistant Enterococci .Enteric, Vector-borne and Zoonotic Infections The rate of amebiasis in British Columbia has remained fairly constant for a decade. One confirmed case of botulism was reported in 2002 in an infant. Annual reporting of campylobacteriosis has continued to decline to its lowest level since 1992 to 2045 reports or a rate of 49.5cases per 100,000. This decline is likely an artifact as it coin-cides with the introduction of a provincial protocol that reducesthe number of stool tests ordered by physicians. One hundred and twenty-seven cases of cryptosporidiosis were reported during 2002 corresponding to a provincial rate of infec-tion of 3.1 cases per 100,000. No outbreaks were identified in2002 although reporting exceeded expected levels during sever-al non-consecutive weeks in the spring. Reporting of Cyclospora cayetanensis fell to 27 cases in 2002 from 39 cases in 2001. Most cases of cyclosporiasis are related to travel to regions of the world where the disease isendemic. There were 140 cases of verotoxigenic E. coli infection reported in 2002 for an annual rate of 3.4 cases per 100,000.In April and May, 10 cases with the same PFGE pattern occurredas part of a national outbreak. A common source was not confirmed. Executive Summary(cont'd) 6The annual rate of giardiasis in BC has been falling for the last ten years, from 38.4 cases per 100,000 in 1993 to 17.0 casesper 100,000 in 2002. Hepatitis A reporting remained stable from the previous year at 80 cases, or 1.9 cases per 100,000. These are the lowestrates documented in BC, and are lower than the average nation-al reporting rate. Two large outbreaks of listeriosis occurred in 2002. Both were associated with the consumption of soft, mould-ripened, pas-teurized milk cheese made by two separate producers onVancouver Island. Reporting of salmonellosis has continued a slight upward trend since 1997, and reached 711 cases in 2002, for a rate of 17.2cases per 100,000. An outbreak of Salmonella Oranienberg affected BC and other provinces in January 2002. Twenty fivecases were identified in the province. Despite a comprehensivenational investigation, a source could not be identified. BC wasalso affected by an international outbreak of Salmonella Poona in April/May 2002. The outbreak was associated with consump-tion of imported cantaloupe. The provincial rate of shigellosis reached a ten year low in 2002 with one hundred and seventy-one cases contributing to a provincial rate of 4.1 cases per 100,000 population. Two out-breaks were identified, one in the lower mainland among menwho have sex with men (MSM) and the second among individuals eating or handling locally produced spinach.Twenty-one cases of typhoid fever were reported in 2002. Rates are highest in the spring when travelers return from Christmasholidays on the Indian subcontinent and parts of Asia. Vibrio parahaemolyticus gastroenteritis reporting rose in 2002 to 26 cases. Nine cases were related to eating raw bivalveshellfish purchased in local restaurants or stores. The provincial rate of yersiniosis has been falling over the last two years, from 25.1 cases per 100,000 in 2000 to 14.5 casesper 100,000 in 2002. Rates of reporting were highest in regionsserved by laboratories performing cold enrichment on stoolspecimens. One case of Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome was reported from the Okanagan during 2002. This is the first reported case in BCsince 1996. This case was exposed to rodent droppings duringclean-up activities in a disused portion of a barn. Four cases of Lyme disease were reported in 2002. One case was associated with exposure on Vancouver Island. Malaria reporting has remained low for the past 5 years follow- ing a peak in the years 1995 through 1997. In 2002, fortycases were reported for a rate of less than one case per100,000 population. 7 2002BC Centre for Disease Control8 2002BC MapbyHealth Delivery Area (HSDA) Diseases Preventable by Vaccination 9Diseases Preventable by Vaccination Seven cases of invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) disease were reported in 2002. Rates have been low since the introduction of the infant conjugate Hib vaccine program in1993. Three of the cases were in children under 5 years of age,and the rest were in adults over 30. One infant case was amonth old, an age too young for vaccination, and died. The second infant was 10 months old and survived; this infant wasunimmunized. The third child was one year of age and was unimmunized. 10Haemophilus influenzae typeb(Hib) ), invasive by Year, 1993-2002 0.00.10.20.30.40.50.6Rate per 100,000population BC Invasive Hib Reports 12 12 9 9 434767 BC Invasive Hib Rate 0.3 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2 0.2 Canadian Hib Rate 0.4 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.11993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 20021.111Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), invasive Rates by HSDA, 2002 Haemophilus influenzae type b (invasive) Rates by Age Group and Sex, 2002 0.02.04.06.08.010.0Rate per 100,000population Invasive Hib Reports - Female 1100000000 Invasive Hib Reports - Male 10 00 000 12 1 Invasive Hib Rate - Female 5.3 1.2 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Invasive Hib Rate - Male 5.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.3 0.3 0.3 < 1 1 - 4 5 - 9 10 - 14 15 - 19 20 - 24 25 - 29 30 - 39 40 - 59 60+1.2 1.3The rate of acute hepatitis B in British Columbia continues to plummet most probably as a result of the grade 6 immunization program introduced in 1992 together with programs for theimmunization of high-risk adults. The rate has fallen from a highof 6.3 per 100,000 population in 1994 to 1.8 per 100,000 popu- lation in 2002. While there were 74 cases in BC in 2002, 2002was the second year running in BC during which no cases ofacute hepatitis B were reported in the 12-20 year age group. 12Hepatitis B Acute Hepatitis B Rates by Year, 1993-2002 0.03.06.09.012.015.0Rate per 100,000population BC Hepatitis B: Acute Reports 161 230 233 221 219 192 142 109 93 74 BC Hepatitis B: Acute Rate 4.5 6.3 6.2 5.7 5.5 4.8 3.5 2.7 2.3 1.8 Canadian He patitis B Rate 9.6 10.6 10.2 8.0 3.5 3.2 4.2 3.2 4.5 2.61993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 20022.113Acute Hepatitis B Rates by HSDA, 2002 Acute Hepatitis B Rates by Age Group and Sex, 2002 0.02.04.06.08.0Rate per 100,000population Hepatitis B: Acute Reports - Female 0010043790 Hepatitis B: Acute Reports - Male 000003 1 0 1 5 2 1 1 Hepatitis B: Acute Rate - Female 0.0 0.0 0.8 0.0 0.0 2.9 2.2 2.2 1.5 0.0 Hepatitis B: Acute Rate - Male 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 2.1 7.4 4.6 3.4 0.3 < 1 1 - 4 5 - 9 10 - 14 15 - 19 20 - 24 25 - 29 30 - 39 40 - 59 60+2.2 2.3Proportion of Patient Visits due to Influenza Like Illness (ILI) per Week Number Compared to Average Proportion of ILI Visits for the Past 13 Seasons Sentinel Physicians, 2002-2003, British Columbia 0.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.5 40 42 44 46 48 50 52 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 Week Number of the YearPercent ILI 0.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.5 2002/2003 season 1989/90 to 2001/02 seasons (Average +/- (2 Standard Units))Influenza surveillance in BC is an annual program that collects, analyses and distributes information to those who need toknow, with emphasis from October to April each year. A network of health agencies and professionals provides vital informationfor the assessment of respiratory illness activities in the com-munity in order to develop and evaluate strategies to protectpublic health. The influenza surveillance program in BC uses a combination of information sources and types. Volunteer sentinel physiciansare recruited yearly to provide reports on the proportion anddemographic characteristics of patient visits due to influenza-like illness (ILI). Sentinel physicians also collect specimens fortesting of respiratory pathogens from patients presenting withacute ILI symptoms. Outbreaks of ILI in institutions such as long-term-care-facilities (LCTF) and hospitals and absenteeism greater than 10 percentdue to ILI in schools and worksites are reported. The LaboratoryServices, BCCDC participate in enhanced surveillance and speci-fication of respiratory viruses during the influenza season.BCCDC, Epidemiology Services requests that all laboratoriesreport influenza activity when identified. The Laboratory Services and Epidemiologists at BCCDC also par- ticipate in the national influenza surveillance activities (FluWatch)providing weekly feedback regarding ILI activities in the province.The Epidemiologists research other sources of influenza activityreports and information. Common sites for influenza informationinclude FluWatch in Ottawa, CDC in Atlanta, Washington State,European Influenza Surveillance System and the World HealthOrganization (WHO). A surveillance report is produced regularly; itis circulated and also posted at the BCCDC web site. 14Influenza 3.1A total of 56 sentinel physicians in BC participated in the influen- za surveillance program during the 2002-2003 influenza seasonas compared to 48 during the 2001-2002 and 40 during the2000-2001 seasons. Forty-four sentinel physicians remainedactive during the continued surveillance activity through the sum-mer months. The proportion of physician visits due to ILI was well below the previous 13 season historical average until week 10 (March 2 to8, 2003) at which time the proportion of visits due to ILI peaked(figure 3.1). The peak of ILI activity this season occurred laterthan the expected, possibly because of milder weather condi-tions. Eight ILI outbreaks in LTCF and 231 outbreaks in schools were reported during the season (figure 3.2). Only one outbreak in aLTCF was laboratory confirmed influenza A and several ILI out-breaks in schools were confirmed influenza B. Other pathogensidentified with illnesses in schools included pertussis, respiratorysyncytial virus (RSV), and norovirus. This compares to 42 ILI out-breaks in LTCF/hospital during 2001-2002, when 90% werecaused by influenza A. Up to week 29, there were a total of 2191 specimens tested for respiratory pathogens (figure 3.3). Of these, 214 (9.8%) wereinfluenza B, 179 (8.2%) influenza A, 191 (8.7%) RSV and 32(1.5%) other viruses. All viruses identified to date were closely related to the season's vaccine strains. 15Number of ILI Outbre aks Reported, ILI Rates and Average ILI for past 13 years, per W eek Number Influenza Surveillance 2002-2003, BC 010203040506070809040414243444546474849505152123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839 Week Number ILI R ate ILI Rate3.216Virus Isol ates and Percentage Positive of All Respiratory Virus Specimens Submitted to BC Provincial Laboratory, per Week Number.

The National Microbiology Laboratory has antigenically characterised 529 influenza viruses to date; all viruses identifiedto date were closely related to the season's vaccine strains. 17Measles Measles Rates by Year, 1993-2002 0.03.06.09.012.0 BC Measles Reports 12 30 15 39 273 2 8 42 22 5 BC Measles Rate 0.3 0.8 0.4 1.0 6.9 0.1 0.2 1.0 0.5 0.1 Canadian Measles Rate 0.7 1.8 8.0 1.1 1.9 0.0 0.1 0.6 0.1 0.01993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002Rate per 100,000population A total of 5 confirmed cases of measles were reported through the enhanced surveillance program in 2002, a substantial reduc- tion from 23 cases in 2001. No cases were secondary or recog-nized to be associated with outbreaks of measles. Three caseswere reported from Fraser Health Authority but dates of onsetwere not suggestive of ongoing transmission. One case wasreported from the Interior and one from Vancouver. Only one ofthe 5 cases was a child, aged 0.9 years. This child had a classi-cal measles clinical syndrome, and had no travel history. Onecase was 17 years old and had recently traveled from Polandand the Netherlands. Three cases were young adults aged 25-29. One of these was a visitor from South Africa, and anotherwas a student from Taiwan. The third adult had no history of travel. Immunization status of the adolescent and adult caseswas unknown. All laboratory confirmations were by IgM serology.One case also demonstrated IgM reactivity to Parvovirus B19. Collection of blood for acute and convalescent serology for IgG is encouraged in Canada for diagnosis of all cases without a linkto a confirmed measles case. This is because the reliability ofIgM testing has declined due to the uncommon occurrence ofmeasles. 4.118Measles Rates by HSDA, 2002 0.01.02.03.04.05.06.0 Measles Reports - Female 000 01010 00 Measles Reports - Male 100 00020 00 Measles Rate - Female 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.8 0.0 0.7 0.0 0.0 0.0 Measles Rate - Male 5.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.5 0.0 0.0 0.0 < 1 1 - 4 5 - 9 10 - 14 15 - 19 20 - 24 25 - 29 30 - 39 40 - 59 60+Measles Rates by Age Group and Sex, 2002 Rate per 100,000population 4.2 4.3There were 32 reports of invasive meningococcal disease in BC during 2002 for a rate of 0.8 per 100,000 population. Four cases occurred in children under the age of one so thatinfants had the highest rate. However, the bulk of the cases (26)occurred in people over the age of 14. In contrast to the yearbefore, there was no significant geographic clustering.Serogrouping of the 32 isolates revealed that 17 (53%) were serogroup B, 8 (25%) Y and 1(3%) serogroup W135. This represents a decline in the contribution of serogroup C from the 45-50% range seen in2000 and 2001. In 2003, routine childhood vaccination against serogroup C disease was introduced in BC. 19Meningococcal Disease (invasive) Meningococcal Disease (invasive) Rates by Year, 1993-2002 0.00.51.01.52.02.5 Rate per 100,000population BC Meningococcal Reports 37 54 40 40 35 16 27 24 53 32 BC Meningococcal Rate 1.0 1.5 1.1 1.0 0.9 0.4 0.7 0.6 1.3 0.8 Canadian Menin gococcal Rate 1.3 1.1 1.0 0.9 0.8 0.5 0.7 0.8 1.1 0.61993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 20025.120Meningococcal Disease (invasive) Rates by HSDA, 2002 Meningococcal Disease (invasive) Rates by Age Group and Sex, 2002 0.02.04.06.08.010.012.0Rate per 100,000population Meningococcal Reports - Female 2100430224 Meningococcal Reports - Male 21002221 22 Meningococcal Rate - Female 10.5 1.2 0.0 0.0 3.0 2.2 0.0 0.6 0.3 1.0 Menin gococcal Rate - Male 10.0 1.2 0.0 0.0 1.4 1.4 1.5 0.3 0.3 0.6 < 1 1 - 4 5 - 9 10 - 14 15 - 19 20 - 24 25 - 29 30 - 39 40 - 59 60+5.2 5.3Six cases of mumps were reported in 2002 for a rate of 0.2 per 100,000, the lowest rate recorded in BC and one-quarter ofthe national rate. Four of the cases were in children under 15years, and 2 were in adults over 40 years. This disease is likelyunderreported as one-third of cases have no salivary glandswelling and mumps may not be considered in the differentialdiagnosis. However, despite an outbreak in 1997, the downward trend in the past decade in BC is in keeping with the expectedepidemiology of the disease. This has been affected by theintroduction of a second dose of mumps vaccine given asmeasles-mumps-rubella vaccine beginning in 1996 as part ofmeasles elimination efforts. 21Mumps Mumps Rates by Year, 1993-2002 0.01.02.03.04.05.0Rate per 100,000population BC Mumps Reports 52 47 35 46 139 18 19 17 26 6 BC Mumps Rate 1.5 1.3 0.9 1.2 3.5 0.5 0.5 0.4 0.6 0.2 Canadian Mum ps Rate 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.1 0.9 0.4 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.61993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 20026.122Mumps Rates by HSDA, 2002 Mumps Rates by Age Group and Sex, 2002 0.01.02.03.04.05.06.0Rate per 100,000population Mumps Reports - Female 011 0000010 Mumps Reports - Male 100 100 0010 Mumps Rate - Female 0.0 1.2 0.8 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.2 0.0 Mum ps Rate - Male 5.0 0.0 0.0 0.7 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.2 0.0 < 1 1 - 4 5 - 9 10 - 14 15 - 19 20 - 24 25 - 29 30 - 39 40 - 59 60+6.2 6.3The rate of reporting of pertussis in 2002 was virtually identical to that of the year before at 15.5 per 100,000 population. However, the previously noted pattern of excess rates in 10-14 year olds was again observed in 2002, suggest-ing that we are still dealing with a cohort of preadolescent chil-dren with poor protection from manufactured lots of vaccine in use during their infancy. As expected, infants also experience ahigh rate of pertussis. The highest regional rates of reporting in2002 came from the Fraser Valley. 23Pertussis Pertussis Rates by Year, 1993-2002 0.010.020.030.040.050.0 Rate per 100,000population BC Pertussis Reports 502 395 438 960 720 369 541 1812 643 642 BC Pertussis Rate 14.1 10.7 11.6 24.7 18.2 9.2 13.4 44.6 15.7 15.5 Canadian Pertussis Rate 25.8 35.0 33.4 18.2 14.8 29.1 20.0 16.1 8.6 7.71993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 20027.124Pertussis Rates by HSDA, 2002 Pertussis Rates by Age Group and Sex, 2002 0.020.040.060.080.0100.0120.0Rate per 100,000population Pertussis Reports - Female 13 25 46 148 34 9 7 19 31 3 Pertussis Reports - Male 21 37 50 126 31 5 3 10 22 2 Pertussis Rate - Female 68.5 30.4 38.5 115.8 25.7 6.6 5.2 5.9 5.1 0.8 Pertussis Rate - Male 104.7 43.2 39.6 93.5 22.2 3.6 2.2 3.1 3.6 0.6 < 1 1 - 4 5 - 9 10 - 14 15 - 19 20 - 24 25 - 29 30 - 39 40 - 59 60+7.2 7.325Pneumococcal Disease (invasive) Pneumococcal Disease (invasive) Rates by 0.02.04.06.08.010.0Rate per 100,000population Note: Reporting of Pneumococcal Meningitis was to Invasive Pneumococcal Disease in January 2000BC Invasive Pneumococcal Reports 541 3 46 12 5 102 186 343 BC Invasive Pneumococcal Rate 0.1 0.1 0.3 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.1 2.5 4.5 8.3 Canadian Invasive Pneumococcal Rate 0.2 0.2 0.3 0.1 0.2 0.5 1.0 6.8 4.6 3.81993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002In 2002, British Columbia reported 343 cases of invasive pneumo- coccal disease (IPD), for a rate of 8.3 per 100,000 population. This is almost double that of 2001 (4.5/100,000) and more thandouble the 2002 national rate of 3.8/100,000. In July 2000, the case definition was broadened from \"Pneumococcal Meningitis (Invasive)\" to include \"PneumococcalOther (Invasive)\". This latter category includes septicemia, sinusi-tis, and pneumonia with bacteremia. The change in case definitionis responsible for the marked increase in reporting over the pasttwo years. In 2001 and 2002 respectively, the \"PneumococcalOther (Invasive)\" reporting code accounted for 91.4% and 93% ofthe IPD reports. The preponderance of IPD continues to be seen in infants and children less than 5 years of age. The incidence of IPD in infantsis similar for males and females, with 10 and 9 cases reportedrespectively. For the 1 to 4 year age group, the incidence in malesis slightly higher than in females, with 52 and 42 cases reported,respectively.The age group of 60 years and over continues to have the next highest rate of IPD at 14.1/100,000 for both males and females. Health Service Delivery Areas reporting the highest rates of IPD were Vancouver (13.3/100,000), Northern Interior(12.6/100,000), and South Vancouver Island (11.9/100,000).Northern Interior and South Vancouver Island were two of thethree highest reporting areas in 2001 as well. In 2002, numerous initiatives were undertaken to increase immunization in high-risk groups. It is estimated that immunizationcoverage increased by 5% over the previous year. In 2003, public health efforts will be directed toward the imple- mentation of a new pneumococcal conjugate vaccine program.This program will target infants starting at 2 months of age andhigh risk and aboriginal children aged 2 years to 59 months. 8.126Pneumococcal Disease ( invasive) Rates by HSDA, 2002 Pneumococcal Disease (invasive) Rates by Age Group and Sex, 2002 0.010.020.030.040.050.060.070.0Rate per 100,000population Invasive Pneumococcal Reports - Female 94 25 1 4 0 2 14 32 56 1 Invasive Pneumococcal Reports - Male 10 52 9 4 1 1 5 12 36 47 0 Invasive Pneumococcal Reports - Female 47.4 51.1 4.2 0.8 3.0 0.0 1.5 4.3 5.2 14.1 Invasive Pneumococcal Re ports - Male 49.9 60.7 7.1 3.0 0.7 0.7 3.7 3.7 5.9 14.1 < 1 1 - 4 5 - 9 10 - 14 15 - 19 20 - 24 25 - 29 30 - 39 40 - 59 60+ Uknown8.2 8.3Only two cases of rubella were reported in BC in 2002, consistent with trends since 1997. Rates appear to have declined in relationto the introduction of the two-dose measles-mumps-rubella vaccine program in 1996. No cases were reported among womenof child-bearing age. However, their susceptibility is highlighted bythe recognition of two cases of rubella in adult males aged 30-39.Husbands or partners have been known to be the source of infection for susceptible pregnant women. Congenital rubella syndrome was reported in an infant born in 2002 with eye and cardiac anomalies consistent with the syndrome and with reactive rubella IgM. The mother had two previous live births and had a non-protective anti-rubella antibodytitre when tested shortly prior to the affected pregnancy. Although she had noted no clinically apparent illness during herpregnancy, she had traveled to India during the first trimester andit is likely that she acquired rubella there and had a subclinicalinfection. Ensuring rubella immunization of women of child-bearing age, prenatal screening for rubella immunity, and post-partum vaccina-tion of rubella susceptible women with rubella vaccine given asmeasles-mumps-rubella vaccine continues to be important in theprevention of congenital rubella syndrome. 27Rubella 0.03.06.09.012.015.0Rate per 100,000population BC Rubella Reports 22 36 26 19 5 4 3 2 2 2 BC Rubella Rate 0.6 1.0 0.7 0.5 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 Canadian Rubella Rate 3.6 0.8 1.0 1.0 13.4 0.2 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.11993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 20029.128Rubella Rates by HSDA, 2002 Rubella Rates by Age Group and Sex, 2002 0.01.02.03.04.05.06.0 Rubella Reports - Female 00000 00000 Rubella Reports - Male 00000 00200 Rubella Rate - Female 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Rubella Rate - Male 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.6 0.0 0.0 < 1 1 - 4 5 - 9 10 - 14 15 - 19 20 - 24 25 - 29 30 - 39 40 - 59 60+Rate per 100,000population 9.2 9.3Sexually Transmitted andBloodborne PathogensSexually Transmitted andBloodborne Pathogens 29 The rate per 100,000 population of persons testing newly positive for HIV remained the same for 2002 as the 2001 rateof 10.7 The age groups of 15-29 in both males and females had rates that were slightly lower than previous years.

Fifty-six percent of the cases were male. The high-est rates were in children under 5 years of age and adults oversixty. There was an increase in infants, but this represented anabsolute increase of four cases from only one last year. No sec-ondary cases were reported.

The less severe clinical presentations were cellulitisin 34%, pneumonia in 18%, and septic arthritis in 8%. Two caseswere pregnancy related with five cases occurring in the puerperalperiod. The reported risk factors included a wound in 30% andsurgery in 5%. Nineteen percent of cases had no reported risk factors. Eleven percent of reported cases were fatal. Seventy-eight percent of reported cases were confirmed by isolation ofGAS from blood, while in 19% GAS was isolated from tissue.Vancouver reported 26% of reported cases followed by SouthFraser (17%) and South Vancouver Island (10%).

The rate of tuberculosis in 2001 was the highest since 1997. However, a part of that increase was due to the recent changesin the reporting system. After adjusting for these changes, thedecline in the incidence rate compared to 2001 would be about16%. Rates for various health regions vary across the province. The Vancouver, Richmond, North Vancouver Island and Simon Fraserhealth service delivery areas have rates exceeding the provincialrate (7.3/100,000 population). The highest incidence rate wasobserved in Vancouver and Richmond (21.8 and 13.1/100,000 population respectively) while the lowest incidence rate wasobserved in Interior Health Authority (1.0/100,000 population). Compared to 2001, the rate of tuberculosis decreased in all regions except North Vancouver Island. The decrease in TB rateswas most pronounced for Thompson Cariboo Shuswap (5.6 vs0.5), South Fraser (12.1 vs 7.2), Northeast (5.9 vs 1.6) andFraser Valley (6.1 vs 2.8).

Participation in this project is broadly representative of the popu- lation of British Columbia, and includes data from laboratoriesserving both the in-patient and out-patient settings. The fifteenparticipating laboratories are listed at the end of this report.BCCAMM agreed that after collection, the data would be com-bined to prevent the identification of sites and/or patients.Following review and approval of this report by BCCAMM and allparticipants, it would be made available to EpidemiologyServices, BCCDC (Dr. David Patrick), and any use or further dissemination would acknowledge BCCAMM.Following review and approval of this report by BCCAMM and all participants, it would be made available to Epidemiology, BCCDC(Dr. David Patrick), and any use or further dissemination wouldacknowledge BCCAMM. This is the second report from this group, with cumulative data to June 30, 2003. With this report, new sites have beenrecruited to participate in the data collection. Some previouslyreported data have been adjusted to reflect new informationreceived back to the beginning of the project, as the new sitesprovided retrospective data. Interpretation of these statisticsmust be done with an understanding of its limitations as furtherdiscussed in the next section. Details are provided in theattached Tables. 52ARO Surveillance in British Columbia 21.1 MRSA reported by BCCAMM ARO Surveillance Project aSee limitation 1 bSee limitation 2 cThe range of up to 62.7% is high, representing probable repeat counting of the same patient having multiple positive specimens submitted for testing * Fourteen sites reporting, data to be amendedTime period Total new Total Approx % Approx % Approx % MRSA S. aureus MRSA is the intent that these data will be collected every six months, with extension to other surveillance information and other labo-ratories as is possible or needed. While it would be desirable tocollect additional demographic or clinical data, this would requireadditional resources. Within the limitations of the data as stated, it is interesting to note the consistency of the number of patients newly identifiedto carry MRSA and the total number of S. aureus isolates tested in each six month period. During the 18-month period of thisproject, the approximate % of MRSA/total S. aureus has remained fairly constant at around 9%. The median %MRSA/total S. aureus also approximates this number. It is recognized that under this system patients may be countedmore than once if presenting at different hospitals or communitylaboratories, and therefore the absolute numbers may over-represent the problem (see footnote \"c\" under Table 1). What is important is the trend over time, and it is fair to say that inBritish Columbia we do not have an escalating problem withMRSA, despite some small local outbreaks. With respect to VRE,it is also encouraging that this organism continues to be veryuncommonly isolated from our patients. 5321.2 VRE reported by BCCAMM ARO Surveillance Project aSee limitation 1 cSee limitation 3 *Fourteen sites reporting, data to be amendedTime period Total new Estimate of VRE as VRE patientsa% of all enterococcic Jan 1-Jun 30, '02 35 <1% 1-Dec Total 30, 5 << 1%Limitations 1.Number and VRE patients: The patient numbers sub- mitted are those identified at each participating laboratory,each patient counted only once at each site. However,patients may be counted more than once if they submittedcultures to more than one of the participating laboratories.The degree of error introduced by this is not felt to be signifi-cant. 2.Number of isolates: The number of isolates reported is gener- ated by laboratory information systems. Laboratories use avariety of approaches to count isolates, some of which arechosen according to local need and some of which are dictatedby the constraints of the laboratory information system. Forexample, some laboratories re-test every isolate on a patient(and thus re-count every isolate), while some laboratorieshave policies which require that the same isolate be re-tested(and thus re-counted) only every four or seven days, depend-ing on the source of the isolate, or the location of the patient.Thus any calculation using the number of isolates tested, e.g. #MRSA/total MRSA tested, is subject to a degree of error. 3.Number of enterococci: Denominator data for enterococci is not provided, as the degree of resistance would be largelyover-estimated. This is due to the fact that enterococci arecommon colonizers, or are present with other more virulentpathogens. They therefore are not subject to susceptibilitytesting and are not counted in laboratory information sys-tems. Or to state it another way, the search for VRE is muchmore vigilant than the testing and reporting of enterococci ingeneral. The same is not as much of a problem for S. aureus , since when S. aureus is present in a specimen it is usually considered a pathogen, subjected to susceptibility testing,and is counted. Having said this, it is still fair to estimate thatVRE represent less than 1% of all enterococci isolated in BC 4.Community versus hospital incidence: Further epidemiologic investigation is required to meaningfully separate the isolatesas arising from the community or arising in the hospital setting. Breaking the numbers down into those reported by community laboratories and those reported by in-patientsettings would not necessarily reflect acquisition in the community, but could be provided if of interest. 5.Time Period: Laboratories may differ on the periods used for counting, some counting on calendar months, and othersusing \"periods\" within a fiscal year. The data collected wererequested for the 6 calendar months or \"periods\" which bestreflect those months. This is not felt to introduce significanterror into these statistics, as it will be the trend of this datathat is most useful. 54 Please refer to the Sources section (page 100) for the author of this report and the list of participating laboratories for thi s study.ARO Surveillance in British Columbia (cont'd)Enteric, Food and Waterborne DiseasesEnteric, Food and Waterborne DiseasesEnteric, Food and Waterborne Diseases 55 Throughout the last ten years, the rate of amebiasis in British Columbia has remained fairly constant. A seasonal pattern is not obvious. During 2002, reporting was highest among malesaged 30 to 59 years of age. Vancouver experienced a higherrate (34.5 cases per 100,000 population) than other health authorities. The location of a large screening program for persons new to Canada in Vancouver partially accounts forheightened levels of reporting. 56Amebiasis Amebiasis Rates by Year, 1993-2002 0.03.06.09.012.015.0 Rate per 100,000population Note: Amebiasis was removed from national surveillance in January 2000BC Amebiasis Reports 316 308 313 372 327 302 307 280 352 364 BC Amebiasis Rate 8.9 8.4 8.3 9.6 8.3 7.6 7.6 6.9 8.6 8.8 Canadian Amebiasis Rate 6.2 5.9 5.5 5.6 6.0 5.2 4.51993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 200222.157Amebiasis Rates by HSDA, 2002 Amebiasis Rates by Age Group and Sex, 2002 0.05.010.015.020.025.030.0Rate per 100,000population Amebiasis Reports - Female 055578 1 9 22 23 12 Amebiasis Reports - Male 105381 5 1 97 9 105 20 Amebiasis Reports - Unknown 0000002001 Amebiasis Rate - Female 0.0 6.1 4.2 3.9 5.3 5.8 14.1 6.8 3.8 3.0 Amebiasis Rate - Male 5.0 0.0 4.0 2.2 5.7 10.7 14.0 24.5 17.2 6.0 < 1 1 - 4 5 - 9 10 - 14 15 - 19 20 - 24 25 - 29 30 - 39 40 - 59 60+22.2 22.32002 Amebiasis Reports Compared to Historical Numbers from 1992 to 2001 0.04.08.012.016.020.0 1234 5678 9 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 1 7 1 8 1 9 2 0 2 1 2 2 2 3 2 4 2 5 2 6 2 7 2 8 2 9 3 0 3 1 3 2 3 3 3 4 3 5 3 6 3 7 3 8 3 9 4 0 4 1 4 2 4 3 4 4 4 5 4 6 4 7 4 8 4 9 5 0 5 1 5 2 5 3 Week Number2002 Cases Median, 10th - 90th percentileNumber of Reports One confirmed case of botulism was reported in 2002 in a four month old resident of South Vancouver Island.Botulism 5822.4Annual reporting has continued to decline to its lowest level since 1992. This decline is likely an artifact as it coincides with the introduction of a provincial protocol that reduces the number ofstool tests ordered by physicians. In 2002, there were 2045reports for a rate of 49.5 cases per 100,000. Reporting washighest during the summer (weeks 22 through 37). The age distribution of cases followed an expected bimodal dis- tribution, with peak reporting rates in the less than 5 year agegroup, and the 20 to 29 year age group. The highest reportingrates were generally seen in the Lower Mainland and onVancouver Island. 59Campylobacteriosis Campylobacteriosis Rates by Year, 43.1 45.2 47.1 37.7 40.1 34.2 32.71993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 200223.160Campylobacteriosis Rates by HSDA, 2002 Campylobacteriosis Rates by Age Group and Sex, 2002 0.020.040.060.080.0100.0 Rate per 100,000population Campylobacteriosis Reports - Female 45 54 0 2 33 7 102 88 167 292 177 0 Campylobacteriosis Reports - Male 13 78 75 40 69 97 80 168 293 145 1 Campylobacteriosis Reports - Unknown 00000 100000 Campylobacteriosis 58.8 52.0 48.1 43.4 < 1 1 - 4 5 - 9 10 - 14 15 - 19 20 - 24 25 - 29 30 - 39 40 - 59 60+ Unknown23.2 23.3610.010.020.030.040.050.060.070.080.090.0100.0 123 456 78 9 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 61 7 1 81 92 0 2 12 2 2 32 42 5 2 62 72 8 2 93 03 1 3 23 3 3 43 53 6 3 73 83 9 4 04 14 2 4 34 44 5 4 64 7 4 84 95 0 5 15 25 3 Week Number2002 Campylobacteriosis Reports Compared to Historical Numbers from 1992 to 2001 Number of Reports 2002 Cases Median, 10th - 90th percentile23.4One hundred and twenty-seven cases were reported during 2002 corresponding to a provincial rate of 3.1 cases per 100,000.

No outbreaks were identified in 2002 although report-ing exceeded expected levels during several non-consecutiveweeks in the spring. Peak reporting was seen, as expected, in the under 5 age group as levels of immunity are higher in olderage groups. Males accounted for 56% of cases.

Both were associated with the consumption of soft, mould-ripened,pasteurized milk cheese made by two separate producers onVancouver Island. The first outbreak was recognized in February following the diag- nosis of meningitis due to L. monocytogenes in two adults. A total of 48 cases were identified, most with onset of illness inFebruary. The most prominent clinical syndrome was febrile gas-troenteritis. Five of the cases were confirmed invasive disease(3 meningitis and 2 bacteremia in pregnancy with miscarriage), 6had clinical illness and identification of the outbreak strain ofthe organism in the stool, and the remaining 37 cases had clini-cal illness following the putative exposure, including one caseassociated with a first trimester pregnancy loss. All confirmedcases had L. monocytogenes serotype 4b, identical by pulsefield gel electrophoresis by two enzymes, and also found in implicated cheese and several environmental specimens fromthe plant. The second outbreak occurred in September with the initial recognition of a cluster of 5 cases with a febrile gastroenteritissyndrome. Enhanced surveillance identified a total of 82 clinicalcases of febrile gastroenteritis following the consumption ofcheese from a single plant. None of the cases had confirmedinvasive disease. Two cases had illness during pregnancy butwithout known adverse outcome. L. monocytogenes serotype 4b, identical by pulse field gel electrophoresis by two enzymesbut different from the strain in the first outbreak, was identifiedin the stool of 14 of 28 cases from whom specimens werereceived for testing. The same strain was identified in thecheese produced by the plant. 76Listeriosis Listeriosis Rates by Year, 1993-2002 0.00.10.20.30.40.5Rate per 100,000population Note: Listeriosis was removed from national surveillance in January 2000.

the health authorities in British Columbia through the Public Health Information System (PHIS). 2) Population estimates and projections are taken from P.E.O.P.L.E. Projection 27 (Population Extrapolation forOrganizational Planning with Less Error). Health DataWarehouse Release Date: September 2002. 3) National rates are provided by Health Canada - Populationand Public Health Branch. All published 2001 and 2002national rates are preliminary numbers and are subject tochange. National rates for 2002 cover January to November2002. Nunavut 2002 numbers are from January to June only.Saskatchewan numbers are from January to August only. 4) Amebiasis, cryptosporidiosis and listeriosis were removed from national surveillance in January 2000. Lyme disease,HIV, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus , vancomycin resistant enterococci, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and yersiniosis are not nationally notifiable diseases. 5) Data for measles, influenza, invasive meningococcal disease and invasive group A streptococcal disease are collected through enhanced surveillance systems. 6) Data for invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) 1992-1999 had previously been limited to pneumococcal meningitis.Since July 2000, the case definition now includes all otherinvasive cases in addition to meningitis. 7) The Jenks Natural Breaks Classification method was used for defining different classifications of disease rates in themaps. This classification method identifies gaps or depres-sions within the data distribution and creates the categoriesbased on the best fit of the data (i.e., groups based on similarities).8) Health Service Delivery Area boundaries are taken from BC STATS, Ministry of Management Services. 9) Participating laboratories for the BCCAMM Surveillance Project: I.
