Introduction Initiated in 1967, the Festival has become an international model for presenting the vitality of contemporary cultural traditions. In producing Festival programs, Smithsonian curators collaborate with partner organizations and communities to conduct research and create strategies for presenting their traditions to a broad public. Through the voices of community members themselves, the Festival shows that cultural traditions are a living, dynamic part of contemporary life. The 2012 Festival resulted from collaboration with numerous partners, resulting in three Festival programs that looked at ways in which culture, creativity, and ingenuity shape communities. Creativity and Crisis presented the creative response of communities in the U.S. and worldwide to the HIV/AIDS crisis. Campus and Community celebrated the 150th anniversary of the public and land grant university system and showed the ways in which public universities and the U.S. Department of Agriculture work with communities to strengthen culture and to understand and overcome challenges. The Citified program, presented in collaboration with the Smithsonian Anacostia Community Museum, celebrated the ways in which artistic expression fosters community in an urban environment. Together, these programs showed the strength and diversity of community-based culture in the United States, fostered a shared appreciation of human creativity, created a deeper understanding of participating communities, and forged lasting connections among participants and visitors. Special evening concerts included the Ralph Rinzler Memorial Concert, concerts of Azerbaijani music and of Roma music, concerts spotlighting recent Smithsonian Folkways recordings, and two concerts co-organized with the National Museum of African American History and Culture, Bring Back the Funk and Music from Monticello, looking at the broad range of African American music. The 2012 Festival took place for two five-day weeks (June 27-July 1 and July 4-8) between Madison Drive and Jefferson Drive and between 9th Street and 14th Street, south of the National Museum of American History and the National Museum of Natural History (see site plan). It featured three programs and special events including the Rinzler Concert. The 2012 program guide included descriptions and participant lists for each program, a site plan, and daily schedules. The Festival was co-presented by the Smithsonian Institution and National Park Service and organized by the Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage. Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage Daniel Sheehy, Director; Sojin Kim, Curator and Special Assistant to the Smithsonian Folklife Festival: Stephen Kidd, Festival Director; Reshma Sinanan-Hill, Production Manager The Festival was supported by federally appropriated funds; Smithsonian trust funds; contributions from governments, businesses, foundations, and individuals; and food, recording, and craft sales. Smithsonian Channel was a Supporter of the Festival. General in-kind support was provided by WPFW, Pacifica Radio, 89.3 FM. Shared Stewardship of Collections The Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage acknowledges and respects the right of artists, performers, Folklife Festival participants, community-based scholars, and knowledge-keepers to collaboratively steward representations of themselves and their intangible cultural heritage in media produced, curated, and distributed by the Center.

Public and land-grant universities and the USDA partner with communities to put research into action in the areas of agriculture and food, health care, sustainable living, urban and rural revitalization, and education. The 2012 Festival program brought these partnerships to life through demonstrations, discussions, and hands- on activities, focused around several themes. Building on Traditions: Many programs at public and land-grant universities and the USDA build on traditional culture, using it as a bridge to the future. Connecting with community members - from preschool students to elders - enriches the learning and research of university students, faculty, and staff by tapping into traditional creative expression and scientific knowledge. From Hawaiian celestial navigation to Mexican American medicinal methods, these programs offer mutual benefits for communities and universities while helping to preserve important knowledge for the future. Reinventing Agriculture: The study of agriculture was part of the original mission of land- grant universities. Today, land-grant universities - often through USDA-supported programs - conduct cutting-edge agricultural research, which leads to important breakthroughs in seed quality, crop yield, and food security. Similarly, community-based projects of the universities and the USDA benefit the nation and the world. Projects in this area of the Festival connected the best of the past to the promise of the future. Sustainable Solutions: The future of our world depends on solutions to growing and harvesting more food, reducing waste, conserving water, and finding viable alternative energy sources. Land-grant and public universities and the USDA collaborate with farmers, foresters, fishermen, biofuel producers, and others to put sustainability research into action, making daily life \"greener\" for local, regional, and global communities. Transforming Communities: What does it take to transform a community? Public and land- grant universities and the U.S. Department of Agriculture use the power of their research and outreach capabilities to partner with community members in ways that profoundly improve many aspects of daily life, including health, education, accessibility, and connectivity. Visitors to the Campus and Community program exercised their green thumbs in our garden spaces; got advice from Executive Master Gardeners and learned how to grow their own pizza garden; attended a \"mini-university\" class on entomology, paleontology, sustainable energy, and many other topics; explored innovative ideas that communities are using to repurpose items usually considered trash; tried a wide variety of 4-H program family activities, from gardening with heirloom seeds to robotics competitions; enjoyed community-based music and dance, which helps preserve and nurture traditional knowledge and keeps students motivated; and shared stories about their personal experiences with public university and USDA programs. Betty Belanus was Curator, with a Curatorial Team consisting of Kurt Dewhurst, Sandy Rikoon, and Pat Turner; Cristina D\u00edaz-Carrera was Program Coordinator. The program was produced in partnership with the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Sponsoring universities included University of California, Davis; University of Florida; University of Hawai'i; University of Illinois; Indiana University; Iowa State University; University of Maryland; Michigan State University; Mississippi State University; University of Missouri; Montana State University; Oregon State University; University of Tennessee, Knoxville; Texas A&MSeries 2: Campus and Community: Public and Land-grant Universities and the USDA at 150Smithsonian Folklife Festival records: 2012 Smithsonian Folklife Festival CFCH.SFF.2012 Page 7 of 57University; University of Vermont; Washington State University; and West Virginia University.

Presented in collaboration with the Smithsonian's Anacostia Community Museum, it highlighted the connections among residents of urban communities as expressed through arts and creativity. The title alluded to the fact that many African American residents living east of the Anacostia River have parents or grandparents who migrated from the rural South, particularly North and South Carolina, and who continue to maintain connections with their southern (although often no longer rural) heritage. Citified also referred to the ongoing transition from cultural and performance traditions shaped primarily by rural agrarian environments to those shaped primarily by wage work in urban industrial environments. Here, in place of rural quilting bees, quilters such as the Daughters of Dorcas & Sons get together in churches and community recreation centers to pass on shared traditions. It is here, too, that the sounds of rural church choirs and musicians, as well as blues and country music traditions, transform into urban popular music and become the foundation of go-go music. The Citified program was part of a long-term Anacostia Community Museum initiative, Call and Response, which explores arts and creativity through exhibitions and installations, museum collections, and community-focused programs. The Anacostia Community Museum is dedicated to a mission centered upon contemporary urban communities, and to research, documentation, and programming that are community-focused. At the core of the museum's work is the belief that active citizen participation in the recovery and preservation of community historical assets, cultural and arts activities, and community advocacy are important and powerful instruments for creating and maintaining a sense of community and civic ownership. The Festival program celebrated the creativity and cultural expression found in schools, churches, community organizations, businesses, and other venues in East-of-the-River neighborhoods. Visitors could meet master artists and creative, inspiring residents from this part of Washington, D.C.; enjoy performances by line dancers, African dancers and drummers, church choirs, hip-hop artists, comedians, and go-go bands; listen to storytellers; watch demonstrations of tattoo art; learn how to make quilt blocks from members of a multi- generational quilting guild; and participate in craft activities. Portia James was Curator, with a Curatorial Team consisting of Olivia Cadaval, Robert Hall, and Diana N'Diaye; Sheila Reinckens was Program Coordinator. The program was produced in collaboration with the Smithsonian Anacostia Community Museum.

With the introduction of The Quilt in 1987, The NAMES Project Foundation redefined the tradition of quilt making in response to contemporary circumstances. Through hands-on panel-making activities, individuals and communities have come together to remember loved ones, grieve, find support and strength, and engage in dialogues for change. In 2012, The Quilt contained nearly 48,000 panels, and it had been viewed by more than 18 million people. It is much more than pieced-together fabric squares: it is a moving and monumental creative collaboration; it is a catalyst to remember, understand, educate, and act. The 2012 Festival program featured the remarkable artistry, inspiration, and impact of The AIDS Memorial Quilt and provided the public with an unparalleled opportunity to experience this highly charged symbol of the AIDS crisis and the largest community art project in the world. It was the first Festival program to focus exclusively on community craft and performance directly developed in response to crisis and grief. With The AIDS Memorial Quilt as the anchor and through craft demonstrations, dance and musical performances, interactive discussions, and other activities, this program commemorated the innovative and resourceful ways through which communities have endeavored to educate people and to cope with one of the most complex pandemics in modern history. The Festival brought together approximately 100 visual artists, designers, quilters, dancers, musicians, community activists, and others who shared the knowledge and creativity that shape their efforts to disseminate the message of the AIDS crisis. Quilt panel-making groups demonstrated and taught a variety of traditional quilting techniques. Volunteers and staff from The NAMES Project Foundation performed the rituals surrounding new panels and Quilt displays. The program also featured other artistic responses to the AIDS crisis from the United States and South Africa, and presented moderated conversations with project contributors, community leaders, and pioneers. Festival venues served as sites for sharing and documenting visitors' personal stories and creative expressions related to living in the age of HIV and AIDS. Visitors of all ages had the opportunity to learn quilting techniques, make panels, and share stories from their own experiences. Sections of The Quilt were displayed throughout the Festival site, incorporated into the various demonstration and performance venues, and laid out on the National Mall - reinforcing The Quilt's size, visual impact, and the scale and diversity of people impacted by HIV and AIDS. Arlene Reiniger was Curator and Anna Kaplan was Program Coordinator. The NAMES Project Foundation team included: Julie Rhoad, Jim Marks, Roddy Williams, Gert McMullin, Jada Harris, Chili Crane, Brian Holman, and Ritchie Crownfield. Creativity and Crisis: Unfolding The AIDS Memorial Quilt program at the 2012 Festival was a partnership between the Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage and The NAMES Project Foundation, with the support and participation of many others.

CFCH.SFF.2012 Page 53 of 57Series 5: Special Events Introduction: Each year the Festival presents a special evening concert to honor both its co-founder Ralph Rinzler (1934-1994) and a key person with whom he collaborated. The 2012 Ralph Rinzler Memorial Concert paid tribute to folklorist, cultural worker, and activist Worth Long, whose work spans five decades and an incredible range. A friend and colleague of Rinzler, Long founded the Mississippi Delta Blues and Heritage Festival, curated multiple Smithsonian Folklife Festivals, and documented traditional arts and culture throughout the Southern United States. His accomplishments include a GRAMMY nomination (with Ralph Rinzler and Barry Lee Pearson) for Roots of Rhythm and Blues: The Robert Johnson Era (1993), a recording with Columbia Records that grew out of a Smithsonian project of the same name, and a Peabody Award for Will the Circle Be Unbroken?, a radio history of the Civil Rights Movement in five Southern cities. He has been recognized by the National Black Arts Festival's Living Legends Award and the Smithsonian's Lifetime Achievement Award. The Rinzler Memorial concert featured performances by the Sweet Heaven Kings led by Norvus Butch Miller, the premier Washington D.C. shout band, based in the United House of Prayer in Anacostia, and the Rising Star Fife and Drum band from Northern Mississippi led by Sharde Thomas, the granddaughter of NEA National Heritage Fellow Othar Turner. The 2012 Festival also featured several other special evening concerts: On Wednesday, June 27, the National Museum of African American History and Culture presented Bring Back the Funk featuring George Clinton, Ivan Neville and Dumpstaphunk, and Meshell Ndegeocello. These legendary and accomplished artists showed how funk music has influenced hip-hop, soul, and rock. In between sets, popular radio personality Tom Joyner spoke to performers and museum experts to get their impressions on funk and the impact it has had on music. On Thursday, June 28, and Thursday, July 5, Azerbaijani Music was featured with Imamyar Hasanov played the kamancha stringed instrument known for its tender and melodic sounds, and Akhavass played percussion in this evening of traditional mugham improvisations and love songs from Azerbaijan. On Friday, June 29, Smithsonian Folkways Recordings presented Quetzal and La Sardina de Naiguat\u00e1, two Smithsonian Folkways recording artists who had just released new albums. Quetzal combines shades of East L.A.'s soundscape, traditional son jarocho of Veracruz, salsa, R&B, and more to express the political and social struggle for self-determination and self-representation. La Sardina de Naiguat\u00e1 fuses traditional Venezuelan parranda music with diverse and progressive instrumentation in a way that has revolutionized and reinvigorated the genre. On Friday, June 29, The Music of Monticello and the Blue Ridge was presented in partnership with the National Museum of African American History and Culture. The Ebony Hillbillies, banjo and guitar duo Sparky and Rhonda Rucker, and guitarist Amythyst Kiah performed the African American folk music tradition of the Virginia Piedmont. Other program highlights include calling by Herschel Tolson and square dancing by the South Side Squares. A demonstration also took place earlier in the day at the Warner Bros Theater, National Museum of American History. On Sunday, July 1, Hungarian Roma Music with K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Balogh was featured. The K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Balogh Gypsy Cimbalom Band joined the Karavan Familia to showcase the wide stylistic varieties and distinctive virtuoso sounds of Roma musical traditions from Hungary and Central Europe.Series 5: Special Events Smithsonian Folklife Festival records: 2012 Smithsonian Folklife Festival CFCH.SFF.2012 Page 54 of 57On Friday, July 6, Mariachi Los Camperos de Nati Cano of Los Angeles joined University of Texas-Pan American's Mariachi Aztl\u00e1n for a joint performance, featuring a special return of Nati Cano on violin. Bring Back the Funk and The Music of Monticello and the Blue Ridge were produced in partnership with the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. The two Azerbaijani Music concerts were produced in collaboration with the Karabakh Foundation. The Hungarian Roma Music concert was produced with the support of the Trust for Mutual Understanding, Embassy of Hungary in the United States, and the Balassi Institute - Hungarian Cultural Center, New York. Federal support for the La Sardina de Naiguat\u00e1 and Quetzal and Mariachi Los Camperos de Nati Cano concerts came from the Latino Initiatives Pool, administered by the Smithsonian Latino Center. Chevron Corporation, the Embassy of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in the United States, Venezuelan Sounds Foundation, and Centro de la Diversidad Cultural (Caracas, Venezuela) were supporters of the La Sardina de Naiguat\u00e1 concert.
