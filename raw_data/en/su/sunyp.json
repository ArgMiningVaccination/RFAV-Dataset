I've seen a significant improvement in my health since I began treatment. I start acupuncture with Zach this week and am looking forward to it! Cathleen S. Today May 15, 2019 I took my sister to see Dr Dreger for the first time because she has many health issues. Dr Dreger spent over an hour looking at her medical records and talking to us about a game plan to help my sister turn her health around. I loved him. He is so caring, knowledgeable and just simply wonderful. I'm so confident that he is where God put us to help my sister with all her health issues. You are the perfect example of what a great doctor looks like Diane K. Friendly staff and welcoming atmosphere Claire H. Zach is absolutely amazing!! He has helped me with my anxiety greatly and he has also helped me with my chronic neck pain. The whole staff is friendly and professional. I highly recommend Zach for acupuncture. He has been extremely helpful!! He is kind and gentle and makes you feel very relaxed and comfortable. I am very grateful for being able to work with him!! Rachael S.
