We are dedicated to helping you achieve optimal health and well-being in all aspects of life. What is Integrative Medicine? Integrative medicine brings together practices once thought of as \"alternative\" medicine. Combining those with the latest research and medical technology, fosters the connection between the mind, body and spirit that is often missing in conventional medicine. Integrative medicine bridges the gap between conventional medicine and complementary therapies. Integrative medicine is an approach to care that puts the patient at the center. It addresses the full range of physical, emotional, mental, social, spiritual and environmental influences that affect a person's health. The defining principles of integrative medicine are: - The patient and practitioner are partners in the healing process. - All factors that influence health, wellness and disease are taken into consideration. This includes body, mind, spirit and community. - Providers use all healing sciences to help the body's innate healing response. - Effective interventions that are natural and less invasive are used whenever possible. - Good medicine is based in good science. It is inquiry-driven and open to new paradigms. - Alongside the concept of treatment, the broader concepts of health promotion and the prevention of illness are important. - The care is personalized to best address the individual's unique conditions, needs and circumstances. Providers of integrative medicine practice its principles and commit themselves to self-exploration and self-development. At the UF Health Integrative Medicine Program, we are redefining personalized care by addressing all aspects of a patient's well-being. Establishing a partnership between patient and practitioner is essential. It helps provide a treatment plan that achieves optimal health. Who is integrative medicine for and how does it help? Integrative medicine is not a replacement for a primary care doctor. Instead, think of an integrative medicine doctor as someone who works with all your health care providers. This helps offer a more comprehensive care plan that utilizes treatments that combine conventional medicine with other therapies. These therapies may include, but are not limited to: - Acupuncture - Ayurvedic Treatments - Chinese Herbal Therapy [Integrative Medicine Consultation](/specialties/integrative-medicine/clinic-services#integrative-medicine-consultation) [Long COVID Treatment (COVID RESTORE)](https://ufhealth.org/conditions-and-treatments/long-covid-treatment) - Massage Therapy [Medical Acupuncture](/specialties/integrative-medicine/clinic-services#medical-acupuncture) - Meditation [Wellness Coaching](/specialties/integrative-medicine/clinic-services#wellness-coaching) - Yoga and Tai Chi Hear from our patients Our locations - [UF Health Integrative Medicine - Springhill](https://ufhealth.org/locations/uf-health-integrative-medicine-springhill) Phone number: [(352) 265-9355](tel:+13522659355) Address:4197 NW 86th Terrace Building 2, Third floor Gainesville, Florida 32606 - [UF Health Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation - Springhill](https://ufhealth.org/locations/uf-health-physical-medicine-and-rehabilitation-springhill) Phone number: [(352) 627-7671](tel:+13526277671) Address:4197 NW 86th Terrace Building Third FL 32606 Our experts - [Irene M Estores](https://ufhealth.org/doctors/irene-m-estores), Specialist [Paulette C Hahn](https://ufhealth.org/doctors/paulette-c-hahn), MDRheumatologist (Joints & Arthritis Specialist) Latest in Integrative Medicine [ One step at a time: Kathy's journey to wellness at UF Health Integrative Medicine ](https://ufhealth.org/stories/2020/one-step-at-a-time-kathys-journey-to-wellness-at-uf-health-integrative-medicine) When Kathy Nobel started experiencing pain from an inherited neurological disorders, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, or CMT, she knew she did not want to be on strong opioids.

[ International Integrative Health Day ](https://ufhealth.org/stories/2020/international-integrative-health-day) It's often difficult to widen your lens and focus on the big picture.
