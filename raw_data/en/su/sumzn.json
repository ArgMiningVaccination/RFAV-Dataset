Upper East Sider and aesthetician [Jillian Wright](http://www.jillianwrightclinicalskinspa.com/maskbar.htm) did, and opened an eponymous skincare bar one year ago\u2014inspired by the exact smoothie-bar scene taking over New York City. At the storefront, you'll find custom-made, DIY masks that use only 100 percent food-grade, freeze-dried ingredients (which have the most nutrients locked in) to whip complexions back in shape\u2014and keep 'em glowing all the time. \"There is a lot of freedom with the mask bar because on any given day, your skin is confronted with different internal and external stressors,\" says Wright. \"Being able to customize a finishing mask allows my staff and I to mix up something that will benefit an individual's unique skin needs in the purest form.\" So what happens when you walk into the bar? (No, it's not a joke.) You come in and an aesthetician asks you a series of questions about your skin: How would you describe it\u2014dry, oily, combination? What are you trying to achieve? Noticing any weird changes? Ones all of the intel is collected, your aesthetician gets to work. A little raw mangosteen powder for an antioxidant boost, a dash of acerola cherry powder for a megadose of vitamin C, you know, all the good stuff. After a few minutes, your organic/vegan/raw/chemical-free/non-GMO/gluten-free concoction is mixed, bottled, and ready to use as soon as you get home. But if you don't live in New York City or won't be able to visit the [Jillian Wright Clinical Skin Spa](http://www.jillianwrightclinicalskinspa.com/index.htm), don't fret!
