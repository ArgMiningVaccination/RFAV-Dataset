(SUNO) is a senior state university of higher learning. It was founded as a branch unit of Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, by Act 28 of the Extraordinary Session of the Louisiana Legislature of September 4, 1956. Over the next two years, the Louisiana Legislature appropriated $1,050,000 out of the General Fund of the State of Louisiana's Treasury for the acquisition of property, the construction of necessary buildings, and the furnishing of the new facility. On September 21, 1959, Southern University at New Orleans, under the direct supervision of the Louisiana State Board of Education, began its initial year of operation on a seventeen-acre site located on the perimeter of Pontchartrain Park, a subdivision of single family residences in eastern New Orleans. With a freshman class of 158 students, one building, and a faculty of fifteen, the University offered ten courses in four academic disciplines -- humanities, science, social science, and commerce. The first graduation took place in May, 1963, at which time baccalaureate degrees were awarded to fifteen persons. Within five short years of its establishment, Southern University at New Orleans experienced remarkable growth. During the fall semester of 1964, its student enrollment increased to 1,300 and its faculty grew to 70. Also, during that same five-year period two events which significantly affected the direction of the institution occurred. First, on November 8, 1960, the Louisiana Legislature adopted Amendment 26. This act prescribed that Southern University at New Orleans shall remain in perpetuum a branch unit, an extension of Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, thereby precluding any impending status of autonomy for SUNO. Second, in January 1964, Virginia Cox Welch, a white high school teacher filed a lawsuit in federal court against the Louisiana State Board of Education. This litigation, Civil Action No. 14217, resulted in opening the university to all individuals regardless of race or color. In 1975, by virtue of Article 8, Section 7 of the Louisiana Constitution of 1974, the management of Southern University at New Orleans was transferred from the Louisiana State of Board of Education to the newly-created Board of Supervisors of Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College. The new constitution also designated SUNO as one of three campuses of the Southern University System having parity with the other campuses. General Information 9 Southern University at New Orleans benefited from the Consent Decree in the 80s. This court order handed down by federal judges as an out-of-court settlement between the State of Louisiana and the Justice Department over the issue of segregation, allowed the University to add nine new programs and to receive enhancement funds to upgrade the physical resources. However, the consent Decree failed to end racial discrimination in higher education in Louisiana. On November 14, 1994, with Civil Action 80-3300, the United States and the state of Louisiana, Governor of the Louisiana, Louisiana Board of Regents, Boards of Supervisors for Louisiana State University and Southern University and the Board of Trustees for State Colleges and Universities agreed to a Desegregation Settlement. With this Settlement (effective through 2004), SUNO retained its open admissions status and classification as a Four Year-V University, expecting to quality as a Four Year- IV University by offering four-year undergraduate programs and graduate programs in specific areas. Prior to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita (August and September 2005), each year, approximately 450 undergraduate and 70 graduate degrees were awarded. The University offered approximately 400 different courses and serviced approximately 4,000 students each semester. A range of basic degree programs in the liberal arts and sciences, business, education, and the technologies, and graduate degree programs in Social Work, Criminal Justice, Computer Information Systems, and Urban Education were among the offerings. The University maintained a faculty of about 270, with 67% of the full-time faculty holding the earned doctorate. Once again, prior to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, SUNO's physical plant consisted of eleven (11) buildings located on sixty-one acres, at an acquisition cost of twenty-five and a half million dollars. Additions, including acquisition of the North Campus and renovations to original buildings combine to provide 388,500 square footage of floor space for instructional and support activities at a total cost of thirty-two and a half million dollars. The Multi-purpose, one of the last buildings constructed, housed a 1200-seat auditorium and increased office-space capacity on the campus. The University temporarily relocated all of its services to its North Campus in March 2006 to give room for remediation and renovation of the North Campus. The following facilities have been re-occupied at the North Campus: The Physical and Health Building (Gymnasium), the Cafeteria, and the upper floors of the Administration Building, the Multipurpose Building, the Old Science (Brown) Building, and the New Science Building. The South Campus has been re-named the Park Campus with reference to the nearby Pontchatrain Park, and the North Campus as the Lake Campus with reference to the Lake Pontchatrain at its northern border in the new Master Plan finalized in 2009. While SUNO had experienced tremendous growth and development in many areas in its short history (pre-Hurricane Katrina), the mission of Southern University at New Orleans, however, has not changed significantly. The University was established primarily, but not exclusively, for the education of African American citizens of the Greater New Orleans area and the State of Louisiana in general. While the University admits and actively recruits qualified students without regard to race, color, origin, religion, age, sex, or physical handicap, it maintains its strong commitment to serve the higher education needs of the student population within the Greater New Orleans Metropolitan area. The current mission was reformed in the late 1990s according to the Board of Regents' Master Plan for Post-Secondary Education. The mission addresses educational, administrative and support programs which assist the University in realizing its six basic objectives and twelve institutional goals. Because of its commitment to equity and opportunity, Southern University has always been driven by a need to serve students where they are (academically) when they enter the University. Having served as a beacon light of inspiration to its constituency, Southern University at New Orleans continues to make a meaningful contribution to the upward mobility of the people of the community which it serves. General Information 1 0 VISION Southern University at New Orleans envisions itself as a premier educational institution in the areas of urban transformation, civic engagement and global.

ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT Many programs, offices, centers, and resources support academic, administrative, and student affairs on the campus. Such programs include the Title III Program. This Program, funded by the U.S. Department of Education under the Higher Education Act of 1965, provides resources and support across all facets of the university through its fifteen (15) sub-programs. For example, the Center for African and African American Studies serves as a cultural, research and teaching resource and identifies, collects, develops, preserves and disseminates new and expanded information and materials about the African heritage, the African American experience, and African and African American contributions to world civilization; the Information Technology Center (ITC) oversees the planning, management, implementation and evaluation of information technology resources and services of administrative and academic needs the Student Development Center takes a holistic approach to the development of students by providing academic, personal, social and career counseling. In addition, the Community Resource Center, housed in the School of Social Work, purposes to increase the cadre of leaders who are both sensitive to human oppression and suffering and committed to improving the quality of social, economic and political life in New Orleans and the Metropolitan area. The Leonard S. Washington Memorial Library, named in honor of the first Library Director, supports the curricular and research needs of the University community through the development of pertinent collections and the provision of services designed to facilitate access to information. A well qualified staff acquires, organizes and services the collections. Books in the general collection are circulated to enrolled students in good standing, faculty, staff, active SUNO Alumni Association members and students and faculty at other universities located in the City of New Orleans as well as throughout the State of Louisiana who are CALL and LALINC courtesy card holders. The Library offers seminars, special instructions, workshops and tours to patrons on the use of the Library and its resources. The Library also participates in a cooperative agreement with other academic libraries in the city and across the state. Faculty members and graduate students affiliated with the University may request a courtesy card to obtain borrowing privileges under this arrangement. Through the Louisiana Library Network (LOUIS), the SUNO community can access other member libraries' online public catalogs. Access to computerized databases, electronic journals and other electronic resources are made available throughout the Library. The Library is an officially-designed selective depository in State and Federal Government documents. Regular library hours are posted each semester at the entrance of the building and in the lobby. Variations from regular schedules are also posted. The Library is temporarily housed on the North Campus due to Hurricane Katrina and is ninety percent (90%) virtual.

As a general use resource and of particular importance to the students, the General Computer Laboratory provides access to the latest technological advances available on the campus. It makes available to students and faculty terminals connected to the mainframe as well as stand-alone personal computers. In addition to making personal computer hardware and terminal access to the mainframe available to laboratory users, the staff offers on-site technical assistance to laboratory users as well as to other PC-users throughout the campus. Assistance is given in the use and installation of software and hardware, programming, and trouble shooting of malfunctioning hardware and software. The link between the University and former students is provided through the Office of Alumni Affairs. A major function of this office is to initiate and maintain communication between both. The office also assists in the recruitment of students and has served as an advocate for the University. The Alumni office has been able to secure some needed resources for the campus through the alumni. The Alumni Association, supported by alumni and life member's dues, supports the Office of Alumni Affairs and is designed to involve all alumni in activities that lead to the fulfillment of the goals and objectives of the University.

STEPS FOR APPLYING FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE A. Apply for admission to Southern University at New Orleans. Financial aid is contingent upon being accepted for admission as a regular student seeking a degree or certificate. Federal and State financial assistance will be considered when an applicant has completed all admission requirements and SUNO has received a valid ISIR (results from the FAFSA) within the established deadlines. B. Submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to the U. S. Department of Education for processing. Upon receipt of the completed form, the agency makes a thorough evaluation of the family's financial strength and, using a federally mandated formula, provides an estimate of the amount the family can contribute toward educational expenses. The agency then sends a three-part document called the Student Aid Report (SAR) to the student within 4-6 weeks after receiving the application. The SAR contains the information provided on the application. If you indicate on your FAFSA that SUNO is to receive the results of this application, the information will be forwarded to the Financial Aid Office electronically (under certain circumstances, we may require you to bring your SAR into our office). Remember to use our School Code (002026) when completing the FAFSA . C. If interested in a Federal Direct Loan, you must complete the Student Loan Data Form and forward it to the SUNO Financial Aid Office. This form is available in the Financial Aid Office or online at www.suno.edu/financial aid. D. Promptly provide all additional requested documentation to the SUNO Financial Aid Office. Failure to provide the requested information will prevent further processing of your application. E. Once the ISIR or SAR, the Loan Data Form (if applicable), and all requested documentation FINANCIAL AID 36 have been received, eligibility will be determined and an official award letter will be made available via the student web. F. Student Loans must be accepted or declined via student web within days of processing. Student Loans will not be disbursed until accepted by student. Deadlines: Priority consideration for financial aid will be given to students who complete the FAFSA and submit all required information to our office by April 15 th for the upcoming academic year. For more information contact the Financial Aid Office at (504) 286-5263. AWARD CONTINGENCIES Financial Aid Awards are made contingent upon your fulfillment of the following terms and conditions.

Additional Assistance Should assistance be made available to you from other sources, such as: scholarships, stipends, tuition waivers and/or outside agencies. Those awards, when combined with all other aid received, must not exceed your financial need and/or cost of attendance, depending on FINANCIAL AID 37 the type of aid received. The following calculation is used to determine your financial need: Cost of Attendance (-) Expect ed Family Contribution = Financial Need Others The University reserves the right to review, adjust, or cancel an award due to changes in the following: Enrollment status, financial status, eligibility, and others. o Default or owing a repayment of Title IV aid and failure to comply with University regulations will also constitute a reason for changing the awards. o An over-award will be deducted from the student's award; otherwise, the student must repay the amount over-awarded. BASIS FOR DENIAL OF FINANCIAL AID Financial Aid may be denied for the following reasons: 1. Defaulting on loans; 2. Owing a repayment on any Title IV aid; 3. Falsifying information which affects the determination of eligibility for aid; 4. Failing to provide necessary verification/documentation; and 5. Failing to meet the satisfactory academic progress minimum standards. Any student who has been disqualified from participating in student financial aid programs because of academic reasons may re-apply for consideration of such aid as soon as that student meets the prescribed standards for eligibility or has successful appealed his/her determination. VERIFICATION POLICY Verification is the process used to check the accuracy of the information that a student submits when applying for Federal Student Aid. Verification procedures are governed by the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, and Subpart E of 34 CFR part 688 \"Verification of Student Aid Application Information\" regulations published in the Federal Register on March 14, 1986 and August 15, 1986. Each school is required by the U. S. Department of Education to verify all applicants selected by the central processing system (CPS), up to a limit of (30) percent of its total Financial Aid Applicants for any type of Title IV student aid. The Pell Grant, Subsidized Stafford Loan, Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant, and College Work-Study are covered by verification. The data items to be verified are: 1. Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) for the base year; 2. U. S. Income Tax paid for the base year; 3. Household size; 4. Number of family members attending post-secondary educational institutions as at least half-FINANCIAL AID 38 time students; 5. Citizenship status; and 6. Certain untaxed income and benefits for the base year, such as, but not limited to: a. Social Security benefits b. Veterans Administration benefits c. Child Support d. Untaxed payments to IRA and/or Keogh plans e. Foreign income exclusion f. Earned income credit g. Unemployment Benefits h. Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC and TANF) The verification procedure is as follows: The verifier reviews documents such as, but not limited to, the U. S. Income Tax returns, (1040, 1040A, 1040EZ), the SAR or ISIR, the non-tax filer form and untaxed income and benefits statements, if applicable, to check the accuracy of information reported. Please Respond Promptly To Requests For Information. Your file will be placed on HOLD until you respond. You will not receive the scheduled federal financial aid awards nor will we certify your student loan until you have provided the requested information. Summer Assistance During the summer term, a student may receive financial assistance (Pell Grants and Federal Stafford Loans) only if the student has remaining eligibility for that academic period. The SAR on file for the previous fall and/or spring is valid for the summer. Additionally, if interested in a student loan, a separate Loan Data Form is required to apply for summer loans. Applications may be obtained from the Financial Aid Office. Loan proceeds for the summer are disbursed in two equal disbursements. Students may also be awarded funds through the Federal/University Work-study and SEOG programs, provided funds remain available. Summer only students are not eligible for financial assistance. Statement of Student's Rights and Responsibilities Students applying for financial aid at SUNO have certain rights and responsibilities that they should be aware of throughout the application and awarding process. RIGHTS The student has the right to know: 1. The financial aid programs available at SUNO. 2. The financial aid application procedure, including applicable deadlines. 3. How their financial aid eligibility was determined and how their need was met. 4. The University's refund and repayment policies. 5. The University's standard for maintaining satisfactory academic progress and the consequences if such progress is not made. FINANCIAL AID 39 All students have the right to make an appointment with their Financial Aid Counselor in the Financial Aid office during normal working hours in order to review their file. Appointments may be scheduled by calling (504) 286-5263. RESPONSIBILITIES The student has the following responsibilities as a recipient of financial aid at SUNO: 1. Complete and submit all required financial aid application materials accurately, by the established deadlines. 2.

Southern University at New Orleans Federal \"Return of Title IV Funds\" Policy All students who resign from the University must submit written notice of resignation to the SUNO Registrar's Office. If a student, who is disbursed Title IV financial Assistance, withdraws or stops attending class on or before completing 60% of the semester in which the Title IV aid was disbursed, the following Return of Title IV Funds policy will be applied. No adjustment will be made to tuition, fees, or Title IV aid for a student who withdraws after the 60% point of the semester. Southern University at New Orleans implemented the federal Return of Title IV Funds policy beginning with the Fall 2000 semester per the Higher Education Act of 1998. This policy applies to any student who receives Title IV aid: Federal Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG), Federal Direct and Stafford Loans (Subsidized and Unsubsidized) and who officially withdraws, drops out, is expelled, takes an unapproved leave of absence (unofficial withdrawal), or fails to return from an approved leave of absence (unofficial withdrawal). Refer to the \"Withdrawal/Resignation\" section of the SUNO catalog for requirements for officially withdrawing from school. The amount of Title IV Funds to be returned to the applicable federal programs will be determined, using the student's withdrawal date, by calculating the percentage of the enrollment period for which the student did not complete. Scheduled breaks of five or more consecutive days are excluded. SUNO will return the lesser of the total of unearned aid or an amount equal to institutional charges multiplied by the percentage of unearned aid. The student will be responsible for repaying any remaining portion that was disbursed to them. FINANCIAL AID 40 Failure to attend class or failure to resign properly could cause the student to receive a letter grade of \"F\" in all courses. In this case, the student would still be subject to the return of funds policy once an official withdrawal date is established. Merely discontinuing class attendance is not considered to be a formal resignation from the university. Students who were awarded financial assistance and who discontinue class attendance may be held responsible for repayment of Title IV aid, tuition and fees. Please refer to the \"Class Attendance Regulations\" section of the SUNO catalog for requirements on class attendance. If the student's portion of unearned Title IV funds is a student loan, no action by the school is necessary. Regular loan terms and conditions apply. If the student's portion of unearned Title IV funds is a federal grant, the student will be required to return no more that 50% of the amount received for the enrollment period. In the event of resignation, the SUNO institutional refund policy will be applied. After performing the Return to Title IV calculation, the student may be liable for any Title IV funds disbursed to their accounts in excess of the amount allowed by federal regulations. The school will determine which portion of any assistance the student owes. If no payment is made, holds will be placed on the student's account and the student will lose eligibility for Title IV aid unless the overpayment is paid in full or satisfactory repayment arrangements are made. Unearned funds are allocated to the Title IV programs from which the student received assistance, in the following order: 1. Unsubsidized Federal Direct Loans 2. Subsidized Federal Direct Loans 3. Federal Pell Grant 4. Academic Competitiveness Grant 5. National SMART Grant 6. Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG) Program Note: Refer to the \"Refund of Fees\" section of the SUNO catalog for more information. Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) Policy for Financial Aid Eligibility Introduction Southern University at New Orleans (SUNO) has adopted the following policy for the purpose of monitoring the academic progress of students receiving federal financial assistance. Those students receiving assistance through University or outside scholarship, stipend, and tuition waiver/exemption programs must meet the criteria established by the awarding entity. Satisfactory academic progress is defined as passing a required number of hours pursued with a required grade point average. Satisfactory academic progress is required of all financial aid recipients at SUNO, including those students who have not participated in federal aid programs in the past. Effective Fall, 2004 eligibility and thereafter, unless otherwise revised, all new, transfer, reentry, and continuing students at SUNO must abide by this policy. Students must be enrolled in an eligible curriculum and must meet the minimum standards at the end of each spring semester to maintain their financial aid eligibility, except as otherwise stated. FINANCIAL AID 41 Maximum Pursued Hours Pursued hours are all hours appearing on the transcript which may include \"W,\" \"P,\" \"S,\" \"U,\" \"NC,\" and \"I\" grades. Remedial, repeated, transfer, suspended, and scholastic amnesty hours are also counted as pursued hours. Transfer credits earned at other institutions which are not applicable to an academic program at SUNO will not be included in the assessment of SAP. Undergraduate Students Students who are enrolled in an eligible 4-year undergraduate curriculum must earn the required hours pursued/earned ratio and GPA as outlined in Tables A and A1. These students may receive financial aid for a maximum of 180 pursued hours, which include hours pursued for double majors. Students who are enrolled in an eligible associate degree curriculum must earn the required pursued/earned hours ratio and GPA as outlined in Tables A and A2. These students may receive financial aid for a maximum of 90 pursued hours. Post-baccalaureate Students Students holding a 4-year or graduate degree who are enrolled in the Associate of Arts Degree in Substance Abuse Certificate of Completion Program will be evaluated for satisfactory academic progress without regard to their undergraduate record. Students enrolled in the Program must earn 67% of the total hours pursued and maintain a cumulative GPA of 2.5. These students may receive financial aid for a maximum of 27 pursued hours. See Tables A and A3. Students holding a 4-year or graduate degree who are enrolled in the Post- Baccalaureate Program for Teacher Certification will be evaluated for satisfactory academic progress using the hours pursued/earned ratio and grade point average for post-baccalaureate hours only, without regard for their undergraduate record. Students must earn 67% of the hours attempted and maintain a cumulative GPA of 2.5. Students may receive Federal Stafford Loans and Work Study for a maximum of 36 pursued hours. See Tables A and A3. Students holding a 4-year college degree and who are pursuing a second undergraduate degree must earn 67% of the total hours pursued and maintain a cumulative GPA of 2.5. These students may receive Federal Stafford Loans and Work Study or a maximum of 60 pursued hours, which may also include hours from the degree already earned. See Tables A and A3. Students holding a 4-year college degree who are enrolled in prerequisite courses toward a graduate program at SUNO must earn 67% of the total pursued hours and maintain a cumulative GPA of 2.5. These students may receive Federal Stafford Loans for a maximum of 12 consecutive months. Graduate Students FINANCIAL AID 42 A graduate student enrolled in an eligible curriculum is required to maintain a cumulative grade point average 3.0 and earn a minimum of seventy-five percent (75%) of the semester hours pursued as outlined in Tables A and A4. A graduate student may receive Federal Stafford Loans and Work Study for a maximum of 150% of the total hours required by his/her degree program. Transfer Students All transcripts from colleges/universities previously attended must be received and evaluated by the Office of Admissions or the Office Records to determine satisfactory academic progress before financial aid is awarded. Transfer students who do not meet SUNO's satisfactory academic progress requirements must file a financial aid appeal in order to be considered for financial aid. Evaluation Period Satisfactory academic progress (SAP) will be evaluated at the end of each spring semester for all students . At the end of each fall semester, SAP will be evaluated only for students who are on financial aid probation and/or have exceeded the maximum number of attempted hours allowed. At the end of each summer session, SAP will be assessed for students enrolled in summer school who have exceeded the maximum number of attempted hours allowed. Transfer and re-admitted students are evaluated at the point of entry/re-entry and again at the end of the spring semester and summer session. Students failing to meet the required earned hours and cumulative grade point average at the time SAP is assessed will lose their financial aid eligibility for the subsequent academic year that they are enrolled at the University. Financial Aid Appeal Procedures Students who are denied financial aid based on unsatisfactory academic progress may appeal in the case of death or serious illness of an immediate family member, serious illness or injury to the student or to a dependent child, other traumatic life-altering events, or other special circumstances that the student would like the committee to consider, i.e., change of degree program, change of grades, academic amnesty, etc. To file an appeal, students must complete and submit the Financial Aid Appeal Petition Form which can be obtained in the Office of Administration and Finance. Students must also include a letter to the Financial Aid Appeals Committee stating the reason(s) that they did not achieve satisfactory academic progress, a copy of an updated transcript, and supporting documentation. The Financial Aid Appeals Committee, which is appointed by the Chancellor, will review and consider all appeals. Effort will be made to notify students of the Committee's decision within two weeks after submission. However, students should be prepared to pay tuition and fees by the payment deadline, and be reimbursed if the appeal is approved and if they meet all eligibility requirements. Students may be allowed up to a maximum of four (4) reinstatements during their undergraduate matriculation. Graduate and Post-Baccalaureate students maybe allowed a maximum of two (2) reinstatements during their matriculation. Financial aid eligibility is not reinstated by simply filing a financial aid appeal. All appeals are reviewed by the Financial Aid Appeals Committee which approves or denies reinstatement. **GENERALLY, FINANCIAL AID APPEALS COMMITTEE DECISIONS ARE FINAL FOR THE AWARD PERIOD** FINANCIAL AID 43 Financial Aid Probation Students who are approved for financial aid reinstatement for the fall semester will be approved on a probationary basis, through the end of the fall semester. To continue on financial aid probation for the following spring semester, students must: 1. Successfully complete a minimum of 70% of the total hours pursued for the probation semester, and 2. Achieve the required cumulative grade point average for the total hours pursued. Students on financial aid probation for the fall semester who fail to meet the above minimum standards will be ineligible to receive financial aid for the following spring semester. These students may appeal for reinstatement, provided a new mitigating circumstance occurred during that fall semester. Students on financial aid probation for the fall semester who meet the above criteria will be allowed to continue to receive financial aid on an extended probationary period for the following spring semester. Students who are approved for financial aid reinstatement for only the spring semester will be evaluated for overall satisfactory academic progress at the end of the spring semester. Financial Aid Appeal Deadlines Generally, deadlines for filing financial aid appeals will be five working days prior to the first day of class. However, while awaiting appeal decisions, students should be prepared to pay tuition and fees by the payment deadline, and be reimbursed if the appeal is approved and if they meet all eligibility requirements. There will be no summer appeals. However, students not eligible for financial aid may attend the summer session at their own expense . Financial aid appeals are approved for subsequent semesters only and may not be applied to any semesters retroactively. Reinstatement of Eligibility Financial aid eligibility will be reinstated after any semester or summer session in which the student meets the University's overall satisfactory academic progress standards. The student will be notified of his/her eligibility reinstatement by the Financial Aid Office and will not have to file an appeal . However, the student must have filed a current Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to be considered for federal aid. Students who have questions about their situation may contact the Office of Student Financial Aid at (504) 286-5263. Financial Aid Appeal Denials If a student's appeal is denied, he/she may appeal for future aid. Staying out of school for one semester will not reinstate a student's financial aid eligibility. He/she must appeal upon his/her return to the University. However, financial aid reinstatement may be considered for students who provide sufficient documentation to support a previously denied appeal, or demonstrate significant academic progress.

Veterans desiring to receive advance standing for military credit must submit an official transcript evaluated by AARTS. ADVANCED STANDING ADMISSION Southern University at New Orleans subscribes to the concept that individuals possessing knowledge equivalent to that attained in a specific course should be advanced to a level that affords a ADMISSION POLICIES AND PROCEDURES 65 continuous challenge. There is no requirement as to where and how such knowledge was acquired. The University offers advanced standing by credit examinations taken while students are not enrolled, APP - The Advanced Placement Program of the College Board; and CEEB - The College Board Examination Board Achievement Tests. The advanced Placement Program (APP) of the College Board gives high school students an opportunity to qualify for one or two courses in each of sixteen possible subject areas by obtaining a score of 3 or higher on APP examinations. Students who have completed these tests should have their scores sent to the Office of Admission. The Advancement Placement Program Examination (APP) is the final examination for a nationally standardized course offered in a limited number of secondary schools under the auspices of the CEEB Advanced Placement Program. The objective of APP is to allow students to begin work toward college credit while still in high school. Students should check with their high school principal or counselor as to the availability of the APP examinations in their school. The APP is offered once a year during MAY at participating high schools. The College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB) Achievement Tests are part of the CEEB Admissions Testing Program. Each year there are several national administrations of the CEEB Achievement Tests. Students should plan to take the specified tests at national testing centers during their senior year of high school, at an early testing date in order that scores may be reported to the University by June 1. Further information concerning the CEEB Achievement Tests may be obtained from the College Entrance Examination Board, Box 592, Princeton, NJ 08540.

STUDENT RESIDENCE REQUIREMENTS Adopted July 27, 1973 Revised May, 1997 Because residence classification is an important part of fee determination, admission regulations and other policies of colleges and universities, it is important that colleges and universities have fair and equitable regulations which can be administered consistently, respecting the interests of both the students and the taxpayers of Louisiana. It is the responsibility of the student to provide the colleges and universities with such evidence as deemed necessary to establish residence status. The residence status of an applicant is determined in accordance with Board regulations and is based upon evidence provided in the application for admission and related documents. Residence status is determined by the Office of Admissions after the completed application for admission has been submitted. ADMISSION POLICIES AND PROCEDURES 66 Policies and procedures governing the criteria for establishing resident status and eligibility for non- resident fee exemptions can be picked up or by writing the Office of Recruitment, Admissions and Retention.

ACADEMIC REGULATIONS 68 Academic Regulations ACADEMIC REGULATIONS 69 Academic Regulations Southern University at New Orleans, as other higher educational institutions, has established certain requirements, which must be met before a degree is granted. These requirements concern courses, majors, grade point averages, and other requirements with which the student must comply. Upon enrolling in the University, each student assumes an obligation to obey all rules and regulations made by properly constituted authorities including, but not limited to, those rules contained through this Catalog and in the Student Handbook. If the requirements are not met, the degree will be withheld until such time as they have been met. A student's advisor may not assume these responsibilities, and he/she may not substitute, waive, or exempt the student from any established requirement. The University and its colleges and school reserve the right to change rules regulating admission, registration, instruction, graduation, academic calendars and the like. It is important for each student to become acquainted with the degree requirements and to remain informed. ACADEMIC YEAR The University operates on a two-semester academic year (Fall and Spring semesters of approximately eighteen weeks each). A Summer session of approximately nine weeks affords students the opportunity to earn additional hours towards graduation. STUDENT ENROLLMENT STATUS/COURSE LOAD A student is classified in terms of the number of semester hours scheduled, including hours audited, in a given semester or Summer session. A full-time undergraduate student is a student taking at least twelve credit hours during a semester or at least four credit hours in a Summer session. Any undergraduate student taking less than twelve credit hours in a regular semester or less than four credit hours in a Summer session is a part-time student. The maximum course load is nineteen (19) credit hours. Any hours in excess of the maximum load, constitute an overload which must have the approval of the faculty advisor, departmental chairperson, college dean and the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs. STUDENT CLASSIFICATION Freshman Less than 30 semester hours credit Sophomore 30-59 semester hours credit Junior 60-89 semester hours credit Senior 90 or more COURSE PROGRESS As a general rule, most courses taught at SUNO extend for one semester or Summer term. Credit is awarded only if a student attends all sessions in a course during a semester or Summer term. ACADEMIC REGULATIONS 70 NUMBERING AND SEQUENCING OF COURSES Courses are assigned numbers based on level of difficulty and are offered to students based upon their readiness to pursue them. Students are encouraged to take courses in a sequential manner, especially those disciplines where lower level courses serve as prerequisites to higher-level courses. A student should not register for any lower-level course in a sequence after having received a passing grade in the higher-level course in the sequence. Courses taken to satisfy General Education Requirements should be taken as early as possible (freshman and sophomore years); however since they generally are not sequenced courses, they can be taken throughout matriculation, providing opportunity for students to take less demanding courses along with their major and minor courses. 001-099 Non-degree Credit Courses- Offered by the University to permit students to make up deficiencies in previous training or to improve their facility in certain basic skills; not for degree credit. 100-199 For undergraduate students, primarily freshman level; ordinarily open to all students; often the basic and/or introductory courses in academic programs. 200-299 For undergraduate students, sophomore level or above. 300-399 For advanced undergraduate students, junior- and senior-level. 400-499 For advanced undergraduate students who have completed a minimum of 60 semester hours. 500-799 For students in Graduate programs; for graduate credit only except where permission is granted to undergraduates who are making timely progress toward a degree. Sequencing of courses must be considered in scheduling major and minor courses, particularly where their pre- and co-requisites for the higher level courses exist. While freshmen should not be scheduled for upper level courses, after students have passed a level, they can still take lower level courses that are not sequenced, especially General Education and University Requirements. CREDIT Academic credit assigned to a course is expressed in semester hours. A credit hour represents one hour of class work or at least two hours of laboratory work a week, together with the necessary preparation, for a semester. The value of each course of instruction and the amount of work required for graduation is stated in terms of semester hours. Three hour courses, for example, require the student to attend class three times a week for a lecture course, and also to do out-of-class assignments and preparation, to earn three credits. A passing grade in a subject that requires three one-hour meetings a week (or the equivalent) for one semester earns credit for three semester hours. A laboratory period of two or three hours is equivalent to one class hour. Southern University at New Orleans grants credit for all courses attempted/carried or completed with the grade of A, B, C, D, F, FX, P, NC, AU, I and those listed on the student's record due to advanced placement, credit by ACADEMIC REGULATIONS 71 examination, and military experience will be posted to the student record the semester after the credit has been awarded. Credit for each course is stated in the Course Descriptions section. Credit by Examination In order to recognize competence through educational experiences other than university instruction, Southern University at New Orleans offers a program of credit by examination. The following policies and procedures have been adopted by the University regarding credit by examination. An enrolled or entering student at Southern University at New Orleans may gain credit through the College-Level Examination Program (CLEP). A fee is associated with this examination. The College-Level Examination Program (CLEP) allows students the opportunity to earn credit in the subject areas listed below. Students are graded on a pass/fail basis and must earn the minimum scores recommended for a passing grade. English Composition General Chemistry Mathematics Introductory Accounting American Government Introductory Business Administration/Management History/American & World Civilization Introductory Economics Introductory Sociology Introductory Marketing Philosophy Money and Banking Introductory/General Psychology Statistics Biology Under the College Level Examination Program (CLEP), the University will award credit for only specified examinations. A student may attempt a CLEP examination at a national CLEP testing center before enrolling and have the scores reported to the campus after the application for admission is completed. These examinations are offered monthly at national CLEP testing centers. Further information concerning the CLEP tests may be obtained from the College Level Examination Program, Box 1821, Princeton, NJ 08450. Requests for credit by examination and the exam should be taken prior to the beginning of a term. Students should not enroll in a class for which credit by examination is desired. Credits earned by examination may not be used to establish full-time or part-time status or eligibility for financial aid, athletics, scholastic honors, veterans' or social security benefits, or the like nor reduce the University's minimum residence requirements. Credits earned by examination are not considered in determining probation and suspension at the end of a semester. The course for which the examination is to be taken must be included in the current bulletin. Transfer students may not take credit examinations until all credits as transfer credits are recorded at Southern University at New Orleans. The student must have on file in the Office of Admissions and Records all official transcripts of the last high school and other colleges attended. To earn credit by examination, a student must earn the equivalent of a \"C\" or better on the examination. Only courses passed will be recorded on the student's record. Such courses are entered ACADEMIC REGULATIONS 72 with a grade of a \"P\", which is not computed in the overall grade-point average. A student may earn a maximum of thirty (30) semester hours credit through this program. A student may attempt to earn credit by examination in a particular course only once. Credit examinations, once failed, may not be repeated. Credit may not be earned in a course which a student previously failed, audited or enrolled. The maximum credit which may be obtained by examination in any one field is determined by the academic department concerned. Credit for Military Experience Honorably discharged veterans of the United States Armed Forces may be allowed credit for physical education upon presentation of a copy of the discharge (DD214) to the Registrar's Office. Credit may be granted for military schools where equivalence in terms of college courses has been recommended for college credit in the \"Guide to the Evaluation of Educational Experience in the Armed Service,\" published by the American Council on Educational (ACE). Veterans should have their military training evaluated by ACE and forwarded to the Admissions Office. For more information please contact the American council on Education Office of Registration for Adult Learning and Educational Credentials, One Dupont Circle, Washington, D.C. 20036-1193, (202) 939-9430. Independent Study Departments may offer courses by individual instruction/independent study. This is considered only in an emergency situation demanding that a student have the course immediately and only with the consent of the appropriate instructor, the department chairperson and/or dean. Request must be executed on the appropriate form according to the established procedure and approved by the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs. GRADES AND GRADING System of Grading The University uses a letter system of grading: A = excellent; B = above average; C = average; D = barely passing; F = failure; FX = failure with excessive absence; AU = audit; I = incomplete; W = withdrew; P = pass and, NC = no credit. Credit for any course in which a student has received a grade of F may be obtained only by repeating the course. Quality Points A student passing a course with a grade of A will receive four quality points for each semester credit hour for that course; with grade B, three quality points for each semester credit hour; with grade C, two quality points for each semester credit hour; with grade D, one quality point for each semester credit hour; and F carries no quality points. An I grade is not counted until it has been resolved into a final grade. For example, a ratio of 2.0 between quality points earned and semester hours attempted is interpreted as a 2.0 (C) average. ACADEMIC REGULATIONS 73 Grade Point Average (GPA) The grades of A, B, C, D, F and FX are included in the computation of the semester grade point average. Grades of AU, P, I, W, and NC are excluded. The semester grade point average is the total number of quality points (numerical values assigned to each letter grade as the final grade in a course) earned, divided by the total number of semester credit hours carried by the student. The cumulative grade point average is calculated by dividing the total number of quality points earned by the total number of hours, excluding I's, W's, P's, NC's and repeated courses. For determining eligibility for holding office or graduating with honors, a student's cumulative average is computed by dividing the total quality points earned by the total semester hours attempted, exclusive of courses with grades of AU, P, W, and NC. Pass-Fail A few courses are graded pass-fail for all students. The grade of P will be given for work of passing quality and the grade of F will be given for work below passing quality. Courses passed with the grade of P may be offered for degree credit, but the grade will not be considered in computing the grade-point average. An F in a pass-fail course will be treated as any other F, both with regard to credit earned and to grade-point average calculation. Repeating Courses A student may repeat a course in order to raise a grade, thereby earning additional quality points; however, the last grade earned stands as the official grade. Both the original grade and the repeated grade will be entered on the student's record. The original grade is disregarded for the purpose of determining the student's grade-point average, hours passed and hours earned; however, both the original and repeated course grades are computed in determining a student's eligibility for holding office and graduating with honors. In the case of repeating a course, the last grade and credits made shall be used in computing the grade point average ratio. Incomplete Grades Course work which is of passing quality but which, because of circumstances beyond the student's control, is not complete, may be marked \"I\" (incomplete). It is the responsibility of the student to initiate the excuse. If an excuse is not received, the instructor is to consider that the delinquent work is of failing quality and an \"I\" grade is not to be given. A grade of \"I\" becomes a grade of \"F\" if not removed by the end of the first six weeks of the following semester if the student is enrolled or within one year if the student is not enrolled the semester following receipt of an \"I\" grade. A student may remove the incomplete grade in absentia. The grade of \"I\" shall be neutral in the calculation of the cumulative grade-point average for retention purposes. Note: A student should not re-enroll in a course in which an incomplete grade was given/received. Graduating seniors are not permitted to receive incomplete grades. Change of Grade After a grade has been recorded in the Office of Records, it can be changed only upon certification by the instructor, department chairperson and college dean and approved by the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs. If an error was one of the transcriptions, it can be corrected by the Registrar. But ACADEMIC REGULATIONS 74 if it was made by an instructor, the Registrar must be authorized by the appropriate instructor, the department chairperson, college dean, and the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs to make the corrective change in the student's record. Grade changes from \"Incomplete\" to a letter grade must be made by the instructor within the time limit by filling the proper incomplete grade report form with the Registrar's Office. Any other change of grade must be initiated by the instructor on the required form available in the Departmental Office. Such petitions require the approval of the department chair and college dean. The Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs will give the final approval. The Registrar will make the change on the student's record and notify the student. Any grade change must be received in the Office of the Registrar within 45 calendar days immediately following the grading period (semester or summer session) in which the grade was given or omitted. Appealing a Grade Students have the right to appeal a final grade which they believe reflects an omission, a possible error, a capricious, arbitrary or prejudiced academic evaluation, or discrimination based on race, color, creed, sex, age, political affiliation, handicap, or national origin. A student's appeal of a grade must be initiated by the student within 30 days after the first day of classes in the next regular semester and in no case after a lapse of one year. The grade appealed remains in effect until the appeal process is completed or the problem resolved. The procedure for appealing a grade is as follows: 1. The student shall discuss the complaint with the faculty member involved and attempt to arrive at a solution. If the decision reached requires change in an official University record, the faculty member must comply with all University regulations and procedures necessary to accomplish the change. 2. If the matter is not resolved between the student and the faculty member, the student must prepare and sign a document which states the facts constituting the basis for the appeal within 30 calendar days from the time that the original complaint was lodged. Copies of this document shall be forwarded to the faculty member and the faculty member's departmental chairperson. If the decision reached requires change in an official University record, the faculty member must comply with all University regulations and procedures necessary to accomplish the change. 3. If the student is not satisfied with the decision reached, he or she may appeal to the dean of the college or school in which the department offering the course is located. The student's appeal must be in writing, detailing the complaint and action taken and sought. If the decision reached requires change in an official University record, the faculty member must comply with all University regulations and procedures necessary to accomplish the change. 4. If the student believes that a serious procedural error occurred or that there was an abuse of discretionary authority in reaching the decision, he or she may file a written petition with the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs. This petition must be accompanied by all documents produced in the appeal. Once a decision is reached, the ACADEMIC REGULATIONS 75 Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs will notify all parties of his/her decision. The decision of the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs will conclude the matter, subject to the right of the Chancellor to review the case. Good Standing A student who has a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 (C) or higher on all college course work attempted and on all work attempted at Southern University at New Orleans is in \"good standing.\" The University will, however, certify a student to be in \"good standing\" as long as that student is eligible to be enrolled. Evaluation of Student Progress Student progress is evaluated by a variety of methods. The measurement and evaluation of learning should be consistent with the objectives of the course and provide the opportunity for the student and the instructor to evaluate progress. Progress Reports At the mid-point of each semester a student may request from an instructor an estimate of his/her grade in the first half of the semester. This estimate is not made a part of the permanent record. At the end of a semester or summer session, the final grade for each course is recorded in the student's permanent record. Grades may be accessed via the SUNO website. Transcripts Each semester and/or summer term grade report is the basis for the student's transcript. Final grades of each semester/term are officially recorded and filed in the Registrar's Office. Students may obtain certified copies of their academic records from the Records Office upon written request. Transcripts requested for academic advisement are available without cost. Official transcripts are issued for the purpose of transferring credits to other colleges, universities, certifying agencies, etc. The first official copy is furnished without cost. A written request, along with a receipt for the payment of the $2 fee must be submitted for each additional transcript. Official transcripts cannot be released until all indebtedness to the University is paid in full. ACADEMIC HONORS Dean's List A full-time student completing twelve or more hours and who earns a 3.75 average or better in any semester in all hours pursued shall be recognized by the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs. Honor Roll A full-time student completing twelve or more hours and who earns a B (3.0) average or better in any semester in all hours pursued shall be placed on the honor roll for that semester. ACADEMIC REGULATIONS 76 PROBATION, SUSPENSION, AND READMISSION REGULATIONS Students with grade-point average deficiencies are notified on the semester grade reports and by letter from the Office of Retention that their academic performance is unsatisfactory; thus placing them on probation or suspension. Students who are placed on academic probation or suspension shall have the designation stamped on their academic records. Students who have been pre- advised/registered and are subsequently suspended shall have their registration automatically canceled. The effect of the probationary status is to serve notice that if the student's record at the end of the next semester is unsatisfactory, he or she will be placed on academic suspension and ineligible to continue the following regular semester at SUNO. Academic suspension is the status which identifies a student who has failed to meet the University's minimum standards and is ineligible to continue to the next regular semester. Students at Southern University at New Orleans are governed by the following academic standards: Probation/Suspension Policy Academic Probation In order for a student to be considered in good standing, they must maintain both a cumulative grade point average and semester grade point average of 2.0. A student will be placed on academic probation whenever his or her cumulative grade point average or semester grade point average falls below 2.00. This policy does not apply to first semester freshmen. Once placed on probation, the student will continue on probation until the cumulative grade point average of 2.00 or higher is achieved (Continued Probation). Once a student is placed on probation, the student must earn a 2.00 semester grade point average in order to continue on probation. Failure to obtain a semester grade point average of 2.00 while on probation and/or continued probation will result in suspension. Once a cumulative grade point average of 2.00 is achieved, a student will be removed from probation and be considered to be in good standing. Academic Suspension Students on academic probation will be suspended for one semester at the conclusion of any semester in which the semester grade point average is less than 2.0. After the lapse of one semester, a student who has been suspended may re-enter on probation, but must make a C average (2.0) in all hours pursued during the semester or the student will be suspended again. ACADEMIC REGULATIONS 77 Any undergraduate student whose cumulative grade point average and semester grade point average simultaneously fall below 2.0 at the conclusion of any given academic semester (fall or spring) will be suspended without the benefit of first being placed on probation. A student who has two consecutive withdrawals or two non-consecutive withdrawals will be suspended for one semester. A student suspended for scholastic deficiencies may re-enroll after the expiration of one semester each time until the fourth suspension. A student suspended at the end of the Spring semester may attend the Summer session. This policy does not apply to students who have been suspended for a fourth time. The fourth suspension will result in permanent expulsion from the University. Permanent expulsion is not subject to appeal. A student under suspension for scholastic reasons may not obtain credit at SUNO for courses pursued at another institution during the period when the student was under suspension. A student who has been suspended for scholastic reasons must complete an application for re- admission after an interval of one semester of non-attendance. NOTE: In order to receive financial aid, a student must be making satisfactory academic progress. For additional information relevant to the University's policies regarding SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS AND FINANCIAL AID refer to the Financial Aid section in the catalog. Appeal of Suspension Students with three or less suspensions may appeal to the Academic Appeals Committee for a waiver of the suspension period if documentation can be provided for extenuating circumstances. Extenuating circumstances are primarily serious illness/injury, death in the immediate family, natural disaster or a traumatic event that interrupts the student's academic progress. In the case of death of a family member, a certificate of death and an affidavit attesting to the relationship of the deceased to the student and the residence of the deceased must be provided. In the case of serious illness/injury, a physician's affidavit is required. Students who cannot document proof of extenuating circumstances cannot apply for a waiver of the suspension period. A letter of appeal and documentation must be submitted to the Academic Appeals Committee in the Office of Retention as soon as possible but no later than ten (10) days prior to the first day of class. Any student whose appeal is denied by the Academic Appeals committee has the right to appeal the suspension to the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs. The fourth suspension will result in permanent expulsion from the University. Permanent expulsion is not subject to appeal. ACADEMIC REGULATIONS 78 ACADEMIC AMNESTY Southern University at New Orleans provides students who find their previous academic record an obstacle to resuming their college work an opportunity to request ACADEMIC AMNESTY. Academic amnesty allows students, who perform unsuccessfully in the initial college experience, to apply for a fresh start at the undergraduate level. After a period of absence of at least five (5) calendar years from Southern University at New Orleans , students may upon request apply to have their previous academic record voided. Students who have been permanently expelled from the University because of a fourth suspension must request and be granted Academic Amnesty prior to completing an application for readmission. Students who otherwise experienced academic difficulties and wish to have their previous record disregarded, must apply for Academic Amnesty within the first semester of re-enrollment. In either situation, a student must provide written evidence that the conditions which caused the poor academic performance have changed to the extent that there is now a reasonable expectation that the student will perform satisfactorily if amnesty is granted. Academic amnesty may be awarded to a student only once and is applicable only to students enrolled and credits earned at Southern University at New Orleans. If a student has been granted Academic Amnesty at another institution, Southern University at New Orleans will honor the Amnesty. The student will remain subject to University policies on probation and suspension and dismissal. Under this policy, no courses previously taken, nor grades previously earned will be counted in the student's grade-point average, except for determining eligibility for holding certain offices and graduating with honors. However, the coursed and grades will remain on the student's academic record and transcript. All grades will be used for determining graduation with Latin honors. A student demonstrating competency in a given area may be allowed advanced standing (without credit) or a waiver of requirements just as any entering freshman, but the student will not be allowed credit by examination for courses lost in academic amnesty. Students are cautioned that many undergraduate professional curricula and most graduate and professional schools compute the undergraduate grade-point average on all hours attempted when considering applications for admission. Academic Amnesty may be granted to a student only once, regardless of the universities attended. Once Academic Amnesty is granted, the decision is irreversible. Academic Amnesty does not preclude federal guidelines for financial aid. Accumulated semester and award limits may include all semesters of enrollment at any college or university. STUDENT CONDUCT Administrative regulations governing the conduct of students enrolled at Southern University at New Orleans are contained in the Student Handbook. Included in this publication are rules and regulations governing student rights and responsibilities, disciplinary sanctions, penalties, violations, types of offenses and the Judicial System. A copy of the Student Handbook may be obtained from the Student Affairs Office. ACADEMIC REGULATIONS 79 REGISTRATION All continuing, transfer, and re-entry students are expected to present themselves for registration in accordance with the plans of registration established for the current year and listed in the University Calendar at the beginning of this Catalog. Students are referred to the chairs of departments and other faculty members for assistance in preparing their schedules. Each student, however, must assume the responsibility of studying his curriculum carefully and should register each semester according to its requirements. Continuing and upper-class transfer students are expected to participate in Pre-Advisement/Registration for the succeeding semester. Upper-class transfer students must have a completed application for admission on file in order to participate in Pre-Advisement/Registration. No student will be registered until he/she has paid fees as assessed by the Comptroller's Office. No student will be permitted to remain in any class unless his/her name is shown on the instructor's roster or unless the instructor has received evidence of proper registration from the Registrar's Office. Registration after the final date provided in the University calendar requires special permission from the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs. A student, with the appropriate approval, may add courses for credit, make section changes, or drop courses within the period provided in the University calendar. Changes in Registration/Student Schedule Adjustment Students may add or drop courses or change from one section of a course to another with the proper approval as indicated in the semester calendar. All such changes must be filed in the Registrar's Office according to the dates as indicated in the academic calendar. A student will be held responsible for all courses appearing on the schedule unless changes have been made in accordance with the regulations. A student may not add courses for credit after the deadline stated in the academic calendar. Forms to facilitate changes in registration and/or adjustments in the student's schedule are available in the Registrar's Office. Courses dropped by the 14th day (7th day for Summer) of instruction will not be included in the student's registration. If a course is dropped after the 14th day (7th day for Summer) of instruction, W (withdrawn) is recorded. If a student drops all courses, the student must withdraw/resign from the University, following the designated procedures. Students may not drop a course by simply staying out of a class. Students are expected to obtain the signature of the instructor, advisor, department head and the registrar. Students are strongly urged to check schedule invoices and mid-term grade reports carefully and drop request the Office of the Registrar to clear from the record courses or grades that appear in error. No student will be permitted a change in course of study or academic major after registering for that particular semester or summer session. When a student makes any change in status, classification, curriculum, division, etc., a Change of Program Form, obtainable from departmental offices, must be completed. The change will become effective the next semester or summer session in which the student is in attendance. A student is not officially dropped from a course until proper forms have been filed with the Registrar's Office. ACADEMIC REGULATIONS 80 Withdrawal/Resignation from the University When a student leaves the University at any time during a semester or a summer session without completing a withdrawal card and without clearing University accounts, the student will receive an F grade in all courses. Further, the right to a statement of honorable dismissal be forfeited, thereby jeopardizing re-entrance to the University or transfer to another accredited institution. Concurrent Registration A student registered at SUNO may not receive degree credit at SUNO for any work taken concurrently at another college or university without proper written approval from the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs. Cross Enrollment An inter-institutional program exists between SUNO and the University of New Orleans and between SUNO and Delgado Community College. This enables a student registered full-time at SUNO to enroll in courses at UNO or Delgado, provided the courses are not being offered at SUNO that semester. In addition, the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs must give written approval. Students currently enrolled may not exceed eighteen semester hours during the regular semester and nine hours during the Summer session. Summer only and transient students may not cross-enroll. Articulation Agreements Southern University at New Orleans has articulation agreements with the University of New Orleans, Delgado Community College, Nunez Community College, and River Parishes Community Colleges. The purpose of these agreements is to serve students in the region in an efficient manner. Furthermore, these agreements underscore the importance of interactions between community colleges and universities and are in keeping with each institution's mission to the State of Louisiana. CLASS ATTENDANCE REGULATIONS Class attendance is regarded as an obligation as wel l as a privilege. All students are expected to attend, regularly and punctually, all classes in which they are enrolled. Failure to do so may seriously jeopardize a student's academic standing. Implicit in these regulations is the notion that students must assume a major responsibility for informing instructors of exceptions. Each instructor will check the roll at each meeting and shall keep a permanent attendance record for each class. These records are subject to inspection by appropriate Dean, College or University officials. A student who is not present when attendance is checked in a class is considered absent. Tardiness is treated as an absence unless an excuse is obtained from the instructor at the end of the period. The initiative in obtaining an excuse rests with the student. Faculty members are required to state in writing and explain to their students, at the beginning of each term, their expectations in regard to both attendance and make-up work. ACADEMIC REGULATIONS 81 Each instructor shall report to the Student Development Center all cases of absences from class, which, in the opinion of the instructor, jeopardize the student's chances of satisfactorily completing the course. A student required to be absent from class because of illness or other unavoidable cause should promptly report the reasons to the instructor and, when required, present excuses. If the student has prior knowledge that he/she will miss certain classed, justification should be submitted to these instructors in advance of the absences. Instructors should make clear that excuses explain absences, but do not remove them. Extended absences due to illness or other circumstances beyond the student's control should be reported to the Vice Chancellor for Student Affair. Instructors will be notified of the circumstances surrounding the absence. Excuses for participation in University-sponsored activities will be initiated by the sponsoring unit and approved by the College Dean and the Office of Academic Affairs. Absences from a class which the student plans to drop carry the same penalty as any other absence. A student does not withdraw from a class by failing to attend. Students are responsible for all class work missed, regardless of the reasons for the absence. Immediately upon the student's return to class, a conference should be arranged with the instructor to determine what action, on the student's part, is necessary to compensate for time lost and the material missed due to the absence. When a student receives a total of four unexcused absences in a given class, the student may be given the grade of \"F\" at the instructor's discretion. Since it is the student's responsibility to be aware of his/her attendance at all times, failure to receive a notice of unexcused absences does not alter his/her status. Any student penalized for being absent an excessive number of times may appeal to the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs. ACADEMIC ADVISEMENT Advisor's Responsibilities All students are assigned an advisor when they are accepted for admission. Faculty advisors will make a conscientious effort to be available during the regular posted office hours and for special appointments, including allotted times during schedule-planning week. Within limited time and consent with other responsibilities, a faculty advisor will (1) help the student define and develop realistic goals, (2) identify special needs, (3) refer the student to available resources, (4) assist the student to plan a program consistent with his/her abilities and interests, (5) monitor progress toward educational/career goals, and (6) discuss linkage between academic preparation and world of work. Advisors may refer students to other University staff. The advisor is responsible for approving the student's proposed course work and maintaining a complete up-to-date file on each advisee. ACADEMIC REGULATIONS 82 Advisee's Responsibilities The responsibility for meeting all academic and graduation requirements, as stated in this catalog, rests ultimately with the student. Each advisee also has the responsibility of (1) clarifying personal values and goals, (2) gathering all relevant decision-making information, (3) becoming knowledgeable about policies, procedures, and requirements, and (4) accepting responsibility for personal decisions. Students are expected to contact their advisors at the following times: (1) pre- advisement/registration, (2) prior to any change in classes, (3) prior to declaring or changing a major, and (4) following any report of unsatisfactory performance or attendance. In case of changes in the University graduation or curriculum requirements, a full-time student who attends without interruption may choose to satisfy either the requirements as the existed at the time of entrance or the new requirements. A student who withdraws from the University for one or more semesters must apply for readmission. A readmitted student is governed in this matter by the rules for readmission. A part-time student may apply to the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs for permission to be graduated under the original requirements. THE FACULTY ADVISOR MAY NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ACTION TAKEN BY THE STUDENT CONTRARY TO THE ADVISOR'S RECOMMENDATION. GENERAL EDUCATION AND UNIVERSITY REQUIREMENTS 83 General Education and University Requirements The challenges of living in a multicultural, highly technological and information-based society are numerous. In order to prepare students for this society, Southern University at New Orleans provides a core curriculum which meets and exceeds the requirements of the Louisiana Board of Regents. The Board of Regents requires that all public colleges and universities provide students with general courses that will equip them with broad-based common educational experiences. Each student should attain the following goals: to communicate effectively in oral and written English; to read with comprehension; to reason abstractly and think critically; to understand numerical data and statistics; to understand the scientific method; to be familiar with key technological and informational applications; to learn independently; to recognize and appreciate cultural diversity; to understand the nature and value of the fine and performing arts; to develop a personal value system while retaining a tolerance for others; and to understand the American political and economic system Through the core curriculum, students at Southern University at New Orleans are introduced to the principal branches of learning, among which are English, natural sciences, humanities, social sciences, and fine arts. It also includes a foundation in computer literacy. This core is especially vital in providing students with knowledge of, and practice in, skills essential to successful academic performance. The intent of the general education requirement, therefore, is to assist in accomplishing the overall goals and objectives of the University. The content of various core components is governed by the statement of purpose for general education in undergraduate programs of the state's public colleges and universities. The University is also committed to providing fundamental knowledge and skills and a broad cultural education. The curriculum provides courses which all students must complete successfully, and which should be substantially completed during the freshman and sophomore years.

DEGREES AND GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS 87 DEGREES WITH DISTINCTION Latin Honors Baccalaureate degrees will be conferred with the following distinctions and cumulative grade point averages: CUM LAUDE 3.20 - 3.49 MAGNA CUM LAUDE 3.50 - 3.79 SUMMA CUM LAUDE3.80 or above Grades for all courses pursued/attempted, including courses repeated to raise a grade, will be used in determining eligibility for graduating with honors. Suspended grades and grades deleted by \"Academic Amnesty\" will be used in computing honors. No grade of \"F\" should appear on the transcript if the student is to receive Latin honors. Transfer students are eligible for Latin Honors provided they satisfy the following criteria: No grade of F should appear either on the transferred transcript or the Southern University at New Orleans transcript. The average is to be computed on all hours pursued just as if they were earned at Southern University at New Orleans. All work pursued at other campuses within the Southern University System will be evaluated as if pursued at Southern University at New Orleans. Other Honors A student with a cumulative GPA of 3.25 or above, regardless of grades, who is ineligible for Latin Honors, will be recognized as graduating \"WITH HONORS\" at commencement. ALL grades for all courses pursued/attempted, including courses repeated to raise a grade, and suspended grades deleted by \"Academic Amnesty\" and/or otherwise suspended, will be used in computing the cumulative grade-point average. REQUIREMENTS FOR GRADUATION Catalog The catalog that determines the curricular requirements for an undergraduate degree is the catalog in effect at the time of entry. Each candidate for a degree must fulfill the requirements of the curriculum in which the degree is expected. A minimum of a C average in courses taken in the major and minor fields must be earned. A student is permitted to graduate according to the Catalog for the year in which the major was selected, provided there has been no break in the student's matriculation. Note: Candidates in teacher education must earn a grade of C or above in each general education course. This requirement is part of the assessment for proficiency in the respective teaching area. Transferring from one university/college to another is not regarded as an interruption of enrollment; DEGREES AND GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS 88 however, the interval between withdrawal from the previous university/college, if any, and enrollment at Southern University at New Orleans, is the controlling factor. A break of one or more semesters will require the student to meet requirements in effect at latest re-entry to the University. Exception to this regulation will occur when external agencies add additional requirements that all graduates must meet, e.g. the Board of Regents, the State Legislature, etc., or BESE Board of Education certificate. Under no circumstances may a Catalog more than ten (10) years old be used. Students, whose enrollment here or elsewhere, is interrupted (either voluntarily or involuntarily) for at least two consecutive semesters, will be subject to the catalog in effect at the time of re-entry. Students who are unable to complete a degree program within ten years after entering the University are expected to follow the Catalog in effect during their eleventh year of attendance (or the Catalog in effect the year of graduation). Students who wish to pursue an additional degree and/or alternative certification on a non-degree basis after completing the first degree may follow the same Catalog if (a) no more than ten years have elapsed and (b) there has not been a break from the University of more than one semester. A student wishing to graduate under a Catalog different from that specified by University policy may submit a request (appeal) in writing to the Office of Academic Affairs. This appeal should be endorsed by the advisor and department head. Only exceptional cases with extenuating circumstances will be considered. The student is responsible for obtaining in writing from the academic advisor with approval of the department chair, college dean, and Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs, any waiver or other deviation from the approved curriculum and from requisites for the degree sought. Credit Hours and Quality Points Requirements for a degree include both quantitative (credits) and qualitative (quality points) standards. The total number of credits and quality points may vary with several curricula. The minimum for the baccalaureate degree is 120 semester hours and 220 quality points. The minimum for the associate degree is 62 semester hours and 124 quality points. A cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 must be attained. Residence Requirement A student who expects to become a candidate for a degree at Southern University at New Orleans must (1) spend at least two semesters (or four summer sessions) at the University; (2) earn at least thirty-one semester hours of credit and sixty-two quality points in the courses pursued and (3) complete the senior year and at least 25% of the total credits required for graduation in residence as a major in the academic college/program from which degree is sought. (Work completed through credit examination or military experience may not be used to satisfy these requirements). In the case of a student transferring from another college/program within the University, with the concurrence of the student's former dean/department head, the requirements for residence in the academic college/program from which a degree is sought may be waived. DEGREES AND GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS 89 Undergraduate Minors A minor is that part of a degree program consisting of a specified group of courses in a particular discipline or field. The minor consist of 18 credit hours required in an undergraduate curriculum. Please consult your departmental/academic advisor to determine whether a minor is required in your particular field and the specific courses needed to fulfill this requirement. Test Requirements All students must pass the Writing Proficiency Examination and fulfill other departmental exit examinations prior to graduation. Special examinations may be required by individual programs, and students must be notified through the prescribed curriculum in such cases. Community Service All students who were first-time freshmen at any post-secondary university/college on August 1, 1991, or any time thereafter are required to engage in a minimum of sixty clock hours of community service as a requirement for graduation. Southern University at New Orleans' community service program utilizes the local community as a laboratory for relating liberal education to social and civic life. Those students 25 years of age or older who completed high school or who earned high school equivalency seven or more years prior to admission and international students may have this requirement waived with approval of the appropriate department chair and college dean. The community service requirement may not be waived for any other reason except certifiable disabilities of such nature that community service projects would jeopardize the welfare of the parties involved. The Student Development Center (286-5375) is the current site of the Community Service Program. Multiple Majors Students who are academically gifted and who have the time are afforded the opportunity to achieve breadth as well as depth in their education experience and to better prepare themselves for a career or graduate studies by pursuing two or more distinct majors simultaneously. A student pursuing a double major will receive a diploma for each degree earned, and certification of the majors will be indicated on the student's transcript. A student pursuing multiple majors must meet the requirements for each major as set by the University. The student must have completed a minimum of 30 semester hours of credit at Southern University at New Orleans, must have a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0, and must receive favorable recommendations from the academic advisors in both areas and be approved by both chairpersons and both deans. To pursue two majors simultaneously, students must petition the department chairperson(s) and dean(s) of the college(s) of the appropriate curricula. An approved course of study must be planned in consultation with both academic advisors and shall be presented to both chairpersons and deans for approval. A copy of this approved course of study shall be transmitted to the Office of Records. Unless otherwise indicated in a particular program, a student may use the same courses to meet specified requirements for the double majors. Prior approval must be obtained from each department chair and dean. DEGREES AND GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS 90 A second (or additional) major will be indicated on the diploma and transcript only if requirements are completed prior to graduation. Requirements for a Second Baccalaureate Degree Students who have a baccalaureate degree from SUNO or any other accredited college or university may earn a second baccalaureate degree provided the following conditions are met: 1. Complete a minimum of thirty-one (31) semester hours above the requirements for the first degree. 2. Complete all subject requirements for the second degree. 3. Meet all quality point average and grade requirements applicable to the second degree. Changes in Degree Requirements The University reserves the right to add or delete course offerings in any curricula when such actions are deemed necessary to strengthen the curricula and better prepare students for the world of work or for admission to graduate and professional schools. Students must meet the curricula requirements for a degree outlined in the Southern University at New Orleans catalog. Students are responsible for knowing degree requirements. Under normal conditions a student should follow the catalog used for enrollment at the time of the initial registration at SUNO. If a student drops out of school for one year and returns, the student must follow the curriculum as indicated in the catalog current at the time of re-enrollment. Commencement Candidates for certificates or degrees are required to participate in the exercises of the commencement season. No degree will be conferred unless the student is present to receive it or has secured written permission from the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs to graduate in absentia. Commencement exercises will be held as stated in the academic calendar. Participation in commencement exercises is restricted to students who have satisfied all academic requirements for degrees and financial requirements prior to the time of commencement. In the event that a grievance, which appeals a decision on whether the student is eligible to graduate and earn a degree, filed by a candidate for graduation is in progress and the grievance cannot be resolved before commencement, individual cases will be reviewed by the Office of Academic Affairs to determine whether the student will be allowed to participate in commencement exercises. >Participation in commencement, if allowed, will not constitute the certification that is required to issue to the student an earned degree. The grievance shall continue until such time as a final decision is rendered or the grievance is withdrawn. Procedures for Obtaining a Diploma During the semester prior to the one in which graduation is anticipated, candidates must request of their department their academic records for compliance with degree requirements. (Each college establishes its own degree requirements, which are listed in that college's section of this catalog.) A formal application for a degree (available in departmental offices) must be completed with an advisor DEGREES AND GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS 91 and approved by the appropriate department chair and college dean. Each candidate must be recommended for graduation by the department. Candidates must: state their name on the application as they wish to have it appear on the diploma and in the commencement program; pay the non-refundable graduation fee and submit the application to the Office of Records for review by the deadline/date indicated in the semester calendar; clear all financial indebtedness to the University prior to commencement; complete one of the curricula as outlined in the Catalog . The University requires a minimum of 120 hours with a cumulative average of 2.0; earn at least thirty-one hours in residence and a passing score on the Writing Proficiency Examination; fulfill departmental and college exit requirements; complete the senior year in residence; be present for commencement exercises.

DEGREES AND GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS 92 The Office of E-Learning Shelia Wood, M.S., Director Office: Information Technology Center, Room 104 Lab: Information Technology Center 101, Meeting Room 1 Hours: 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m., M-F Phone: (504) 286-5182 Fax: (504) 286-516 E-LEARNING COURSES Increased access to higher education has been a defining characteristic of SUNO and an integral part of its mission. E-Learning courses are emerging as a key component of the University's academic program, providing additional flexibility in course scheduling. Two main instructional delivery formats are used: compressed video and Internet-based courses. Students access compressed video courses through cable broadcast or through non-broadcast viewing on campus or at off campus sites. The University, however, is moving toward greater use of Internet-based courses as the primary E-Learning format. This trend reflects student demand and interest. Current information regarding E- Learning courses is published in the class schedule each semester. In addition, the University is infusing the benefits of information technology in all classes through the increased use of electronic library and research resources, increased faculty-student contact through e-mail, and instructional delivery utilizing technology. Finally, the University has formed an E-Learning committee to assist in coordinating and planning E-Learning courses to ensure that the courses maintain the same academic rigor as traditional courses. The Office of E-Learning currently employs a Director of E-Learning, who reports directly to the Office of Academic Affairs. SUNO has monies appropriated to the Office of E-Learning from our general budget that reflect our commitment to electronic learning. The Office of E-Learning also employs the Blackboard Administrator, who is responsible for maintaining the Blackboard Academic Suite and the Student Services Coordinator, who serves as a liaison between the online degree seeking students and the administration.CURRICULA 93 Honors Program Wesley T.

Administered by the director of the Honors Program and the Honors Program Committee, this program offers students the opportunity to cultivate the habits of critical thinking, independent analysis and creative expression through small classes and independent study under the guidance of recognized teacher-scholars. The program also encourages learning communities and a setting in which students who share similar enthusiasm for learning are brought together in intellectual fellowship and provides public recognition for superior academic achievement. The qualifications for students desiring to enter the Honors Program are as follows: Entering Freshmen 1. Minimum ACT Composite score of 21 or SAT equivalent 2. High School cumulative average of B or better 3. Two letters of recommendation Students Currently Enrolled In the University and Transfer Students 1. Minimum overall grade point average of 3.25 in work undertaken at the university or college level. 2. Continuing freshman, sophomore standing, juniors and seniors who meet ACT and GPA criteria may apply and be admitted to the Honors Program (a transfer student who previously participated in a honors program at another university may receive credit for honors work completed). 3. Two letters of recommendation (One from an advisor and one from an instructor who has taught the student. CRITERIA FOR RETENTION IN THE PROGRAM All Honors Program students must maintain a 3.25 cumulative GPA and make progress toward fulfilling the requirements of the Honors Program and their disciplinary major. All Honors Program student grades will be audited each term. Those at risk of falling below the threshold will be notified in writing and are required to meet with their Honors' Program Academic Advisor. CURRICULA 94 PROBATION Honors Program students falling below the specified 3.25 cumulative GPA must: 1. Meet with an Honors Program Academic Advisor to discuss their academic schedule and a plan for improvement. 2. Receive a term GPA (minimum of 12 credits) above the threshold in the following term. 3. Obtain a cumulative GPA above the 3.25 threshold at the end of two terms of course work subsequent to the term in which they fell below. If the cumulative GPA remains below the threshold, the student may be removed from the Program. However, a student has the right to appeal their circumstances following the University's Appeal process. REENTRY Students may apply for readmission when their cumulative GPA is above the 3.25 threshold. SELECTED COURSES FOR THE HONORS PROGRAM Course Designators Honors sections of existing courses are offered using the departmental designator with an \"H\" suffix (e.g., ENGL 111H, MATH161H, etc). The Honors curriculum requires students to complete between 20 and 25 credits of Honors sections of current Southern University at New Orleans' courses. These will be small sections of existing Southern University at New Orleans offerings tailored to Honor Program Students. Courses will be selected to offer both horizontal (disciplinary) and vertical (100- 400 level) breadth. Parameters : 1. Enrollment will be limited to 20 students for lower-division, 15 students in the upper-division courses. 2. Courses must meet prerequisites for subsequent courses, as determined by curricular and administrative units. 3. Courses will offer not merely more of the same material as their non-Honors counterparts, but instead should show greater breadth, integration, different approaches, etc. Experimentation with new teaching techniques is encouraged. Honors courses provide enrichment opportunities to students and faculty. 4.

A wide range of issues are addressed in the study of child development and family studies; including family theory; biological, cognitive, and emotional development throughout the lifespan; the impact of the family, neighborhood, workplace, and culture on development; and the influence that developing humans have on their environment. The program leads to multidisciplinary career opportunities related to human development, education, and well- being of children and families. CDFS candidates select electives that may include courses in social work, business, criminal justice, psychology, substance abuse, sociology, government and education, with the goal of pursuing a career path that prepares them for entry level professional positions in a variety of settings, including but not limited to administration of programs for children, services for youth and the elderly, policy advocacy for children, and family and community service liaisons. The students pursuing this major are prepared to assume leadership roles in the areas related to child and family studies. Graduates of the program may be found in public and private schools; in non-profit and for profit community agencies; in media such as newspapers and broadcasting companies; and in research institutions. Some graduates of the program have opened their own day care centers within the first two years after graduation. The Child Development and Family Studies major provides an excellent basis for future careers in law, business, child and family advocacy, social work and education. It also provides a strong foundation for those candidates who wish to pursue research or graduate level study in these fields. Candidates completing the CDFS program are expected to demonstrate attributes characteristic of the College of Education's and Human Development's Conceptual Framework, \"Reflective Practitioners for Global Environments.\" Four principles support this framework: A focus on people's strengths. A celebration of human diversity. The application of multi-system practice methods to promote human well-being and fair, equitable communities. A commitment to social justice. COLLEGE OF EDUCATION AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT 248 Conceptual Framework of the College of Education and Human Development To enhance the Conceptual Framework theme and components, the CDFS program, in addition, applies the principles outlined in the Body of Knowledge Model developed by the American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences (AAFCS), which is the CDFS program's accrediting body. Students understand the synergistic, integrative nature of the family and consumer sciences profession with its focus on the interrelationships among individuals, families, consumers, and communities as taught in the human systems theory, CDFS 325 and life course development, CDFS 303. The same Model , as visually displayed below, provides a context for all of the other CDFS course offerings, field experiences, and practicum.

Of central importance is the development of these relationships in such a way as to promote social and economic justice and protect the opportunities for people to live with dignity and freedom. Professional practice focuses on the transactions between people and their environments that affect their ability to accomplish life tasks. EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY AND THEMES The Southern University School of Social Work is committed to a view of social work that is holistic and transcending in its approach.

(Prerequisite: Consent of BSW Director) SCHOOL OF SOCIAL WORK 293 SCHOOL OF GRADUATE STUDIES 294 The School of Graduate Studies GRADUATE DEGREE PROGRAMS, REQUIREMENTS, CURRICULA Wesley T. Bishop, J.D, Interim Dean Office: Administration Email: wbishop@suno.edu Deidre Hazure, Administrative Specialist/Graduate Studies Admissions Coordinator Valencia Jackson, Administrative Assistant IV As a result of the implementation of the Higher Education Desegregation Settlement Agreement, Southern University at New Orleans (SUNO) implemented four new graduate programs in addition to the Master of Social Work (MSW) program that has been fully operational for over twenty-five years. The Master of Social Work program currently has 300 students enrolled and awards more than 100 MSW degrees each year. Of the new programs, the Master of Criminal Justice program began offering classes Fall, 1996. The Master of Computer Information Systems began offering classes in the Fall, 1997 and was fully approved by the Louisiana Board of Regents to begin offering courses as of the Fall, 1999 semester along with the Master of Arts in Urban Education Program. The fifth graduate program, Museum Studies, obtained its initial approval and began offering classes in the Fall, 2002. The Master of Computer Information Systems was converted to the Master of Management Information Systems in the Fall Semester 2006. The Master of Arts in Urban Education is no longer available. The University established the School of Graduate Studies (SGS) to coordinate and support all graduate degree programs. The School of the Graduate Studies is under the general supervision of the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and is administered by the Dean of Graduate Studies. Under the direction of the Graduate Dean, this office is responsible for the creation, monitoring, and continued improvement of all graduate programs and their curricula. It also assists with the establishment of graduate level policies, keeping records, budget management, and student recruitment, processing applications to the various graduate studies programs, and providing support and professional development services for the individual graduate programs. The Graduate Dean is additionally responsible for aiding the accreditation process of all graduate programs. The School of Graduate Studies has developed the policies and procedures contained in this document as a means of standardizing and institutionalizing its daily operations and services to students. The policies are in accordance with the power vested in the SGS through the legislative authority which emanates from those policies set by the Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College System, of which SUNO is a member campus. These policies and procedures are consistent with those national standards which are set by such scholarly organizations as the National Council of Graduate Schools. Such policies are intended to guide the administration of the program, as well as all actions and decisions that result, in a fair and impartial manner. As published, the policies are to be followed by all faculty, staff and students in the SUNO School of Graduate Studies. SCHOOL OF GRADUATE STUDIES 295 GRADUATE STUDIES PROGRAMS' MISSION STATEMENT The School of Graduate Studies at SUNO expands the mission of the University to the graduate and professional level. The graduate programs which are currently available provide excellent opportunities for advanced study in contemporary and cutting edge areas. These programs have each been created to extend the higher education opportunity for students from all sectors of the community. Each of the graduate degree programs is open to recent graduates of SUNO's undergraduate programs, graduates from all other accredited colleges and universities, as well as professionals who have been working in their fields for a number of years. SUNO has a longstanding commitment to support the educational goals of non-traditional students, including working adults and those enrolled in evening and weekend programs or in non-credit courses. The SGS broadens the University's tradition of accommodating all citizens through innovative and non-traditional course offerings and scheduling. GOALS The primary focus of the School of Graduate Studies Program is to promote quality and excellence in graduate education, as well as to promote research and scholarly activities. In accordance with this perspective, the Graduate Studies Program has undertaken the following goals: 1. to offer programs that will encourage students of all races and backgrounds to enroll; 2. to prepare each student for successful completion of graduate studies; 3. to prepare all students for successful employment in their chosen professions; 4. to increase the number of graduate students involved in research and other scholarly activities; 5. to develop an effective program of enrollment management that would enable the University to maintain a student body of graduate students who are committed to high academic achievement and who represent diversified social, economic, and geographical origins; and, 6. to provide available financial resources for eligible students where possible. ORGANIZATION The Office of the School of Graduate Studies consists of a Dean, Graduate Recruiter, Administrative Specialist/Budget Unit Supervisor, and Administrative Assistant IV. The Office is responsible for enforcing minimum general standards of graduate work at Southern University at New Orleans and for the coordination of graduate degree programs in the various colleges. Central policies and standards of the SGS are established by the Graduate Council. The responsibility for the detailed day-to-day operations of graduate programs lies with the individual departments and colleges. The Office of the School of Graduate Studies processes admission to the master's degree programs. This includes the receipt and processing of all graduate admission applications, and the processing and clearing of graduation applications for all graduate students. SCHOOL OF GRADUATE STUDIES 296 THE GRADUATE COUNCIL The By-Laws and Regulations of the Board of Supervisors of the Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College System (Section 1-2.10; Part A.) commissioned the Graduate Council, as follows: \"There shall be a Graduate Council on each campus having a graduate program.\" Parts B, through E articulate the membership, duties, officers, terms of office, and the meeting regulations around which such councils should organize. The Graduate Council is the policy-making body for the SGS and, as such, has responsibility for its governance, including authority to grant exceptions in special cases to any policy it establishes. All decisions of the Graduate Council are subject to review by the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and the Chancellor of SUNO. The purpose of the Graduate Council is to provide a forum for broad participation in the formulation of academic policies which govern graduate programs. The Graduate Council functions in recognition of the need for a shared responsibility in graduate education. To a large extent, colleges are responsible for maintaining and managing graduate programs; however, the Graduate Council performs the function of review and coordination. As a representative body of faculty scholars and graduate students of the SGS, the Graduate Council is composed of ten (10) faculty members with at least one representative selected from the graduate faculty of each academic program; the Library Director; a representative from the Office of Academic Affairs as an ex-officio member; and two graduate students who are elected or appointed from the various graduate programs on a rotating basis. ADMINISTRATION The executive and administrative matters of the SGS are the responsibility of the Graduate Dean, who is charged directly with enforcement of the regulations of the SGS and with the organization of its administrative procedures. Although the colleges and individual graduate programs assume responsibility for the maintenance of program quality, the Graduate Dean has a major responsibility to provide the leadership to ensure and enhance a high quality of graduate study and research. The measure of program accountability shall be in the form of periodic external reviews and overall on-going internal programmatic assessments. The Graduate Dean exercises leadership in initiating new programs and facilitating appropriate interdisciplinary collaboration. As the chief administrative officer within the Graduate School, the Dean serves as an ex officio member of all committees formed to conduct, oversee, or make determination in matters relative to graduate education. Some of the other duties with which the Graduate Dean is charged include the financial and budget management; securing and administering external funding and research opportunities for graduate faculty and students; strategic planning processes; international programs and collaboration opportunities; utilizing effective communication and negotiation skills; and continual student recruitment. The Graduate Dean is assisted in this work by an administrative and clerical staff. ADMISSION TO THE SCHOOL OF GRADUATE STUDIES Admission to the SGS and all of its programs and operations is open to all persons regardless of race, creed, color, sex, age, marital status, disability, veterans' status, or national origin who meet the requirements and qualifications of the SUNO programs. A baccalaureate degree from an accredited college or university is required for admission to the SGS. Official undergraduate transcripts must accompany all applications. No application will be considered unless it is complete and is SCHOOL OF GRADUATE STUDIES 297 accompanied by all official transcripts that reflect all of the student's undergraduate, and graduate if any, credits earned and in process. No transcript will be accepted as official unless it is received directly from the registrar of the institution where the work was done. Official supplementary transcripts are required as soon as they are available for work completed after the submission of the application and official transcripts. There are two levels of admission to graduate programs: (1) Admission to the SGS and (2) Admission to the degree granting graduate program. Admission to the SGS is a prerequisite for admissions to a graduate degree program and is used to assure that applicants meet all of the minimum qualifications set by the University. The degree program in which the student plans to study shall determine whether or not the student is qualified to be admitted for graduate study in that particular program. Upon receipt of the completed application, the Office of the School of Graduate Studies shall determine whether the student meets the general SUNO graduate admission requirements. The office shall notify the degree program and shall request that the program evaluate the student's credentials. After having done so, the program shall communicate its decision to the SGS office so that the student can be officially admitted or advised otherwise. ADMISSIONS COMMITTEES Each graduate degree program shall have a committee, consisting of current graduate faculty and chaired by the program director/chair, whose functions include serving as the screening and admissions body for that program. This committee and other interested faculty from the colleges shall scrutinize the credentials of the applicants and make recommendations concerning admission decisions. The program level admissions decisions are then submitted to the SGS office and the appropriate actions are immediately taken. ADMISSION CRITERIA To be considered for admission to the SGS the applicant must submit to the SGS Office the following: A baccalaureate degree from a university or college approved by a recognized accrediting agency. One completed copy of an application form and a medical form which can be obtained from the SGS Office. Individual graduate degree program deadlines for applying are listed on the application and must be adhered to. One copy of an official transcript from each institution attended. Transcripts must be sent directly to the SGS Office from each college attended, even if no credit was earned and even though the work may be shown on another transcript. The request for the transcripts must be made early in order to arrive in the SGS Office in sufficient time to be considered for admission into the desired degree program. Applications will not be processed unless an official transcript has been received. Grade point averages of at least 2.5 for undergraduate work and 3.0 for all graduate and post- baccalaureate work for which a grade is given . (A-4, B-3, C-2, D-1, F-0, WF considered F) Satisfactory academic standing at the last university or college attended; that is, the applicant must be eligible to re-enter in good standing. SCHOOL OF GRADUATE STUDIES 298 Three (3) typewritten letters of recommendation addressed to the Graduate Dean. A written Philosophy Statement or other writing sample as may be required by specific programs. All applications must be accompanied by a non-refundable one-time application fee of $25 ($35 for international students) in the form of a money order or check made payable to Southern University at New Orleans ( do not send cash through the mail ). International students must pay the additional fees associated with the required third-party evaluation of foreign transcripts. Admission to the SGS does not automatically admit a student to candidacy for an advanced degree. REGULAR ADMISSION An applicant who meets all the above requirements is normally granted unconditional admission, provided the applicant is accepted by the degree program. It should be understood that admission to the SGS does not imply admission to any specific degree granting program. A student may be required to take additional coursework to meet the prerequisites of the particular degree program. Degree program admission standards may be higher than the minimum SGS requirements. Also, applicants who do not meet all the criteria for admission may be granted a conditional or provisional admission classification upon a recommendation from the appropriate program. International students are not eligible for conditional or provisional admission classification. CONDITIONAL ADMISSION Applicants who fail to meet all the admission requirements may, in rare instances, be considered for conditional admission, but only upon very strong recommendation by the degree granting program. The recommendation will be based on the grounds of other evidence of the student's ability to carry out the graduate program of study successfully. The Office of the School of Graduate Studies will consider the merits of the case and determine whether conditional admission is warranted. Conditional admission may be granted as a temporary classification for only one academic year to applicants who otherwise satisfy the criteria for admission. The applicant can be admitted only under the condition that the deficiency be removed before the end of the academic year. It will also be required that at least a B (3.0) average be maintained for all coursework attempted during the period of conditional admission. If the condition of admission is not met by the end of the period, the academic program must evaluate the student's performance and notify the Dean of the SGS and the student of the action to be taken to change the student's admission classification to either fully admitted or to being expelled from the University. SCHOOL OF GRADUATE STUDIES 299 PROVISIONAL ADMISSION Applicants who have applied to the SGS for admission, but who are unable to supply complete credentials or to complete any step in the admission process by the admission deadline, may be admitted provisionally for one semester upon a recommendation to the Graduate Dean from the program to which the student has applied. The provisional admission classification cannot be extended beyond one semester. When a student is currently enrolled in a university program, he/she may be granted provisional admission as a temporary classification provided that all other records except for the semester in progress have been submitted. In such cases, complete credentials must be received no later than thirty (30) days after the first day of classes in the fall and spring semester and no later than fifteen (15) days after the first day of classes in the summer session, or admission may be canceled. Students will not be allowed a second provisional admission. PROBATIONARY ADMISSION An applicant who does not meet the academic admission standards because his/her undergraduate grade point average is below that required by the SGS or the specific graduate program, which they seek admission, may be admitted on probation. If admitted on probation, the student must earn a 3.0 ( B) grade point average by the end of the first two (2) semesters. Failure to meet this requirement can result in expulsion. NON-DEGREE SEEKING ADMISSION Unlike a graduate degree seeking applicant who seeks formal and full admission into a degree- granting program for the purpose of completing all master degree requirements, a non-degree seeking applicant is one who does not desire to matriculate through an entire graduate degree program. Applicants who hold baccalaureate or graduate degrees and who desire to enroll in selected graduate courses at SUNO without formally entering a degree program must, however, submit an admission application, all official transcripts, and must pay the non-refundable application fee. The non-degree status provides an applicant permission to take courses and does not in any way imply or guarantee a subsequent change to regular admission classification and acceptance into a degree-granting graduate program. This classification is appropriate for students who wish to take graduate level courses for personal enrichment, professional development, certification purposes, or to later apply for the degree seeking classification. Students should carefully consider the potential problems associated with this classification: (1) some 600-level courses may not be open to non-degree students; (2) non-degree students are not eligible for federal financial aid; and, (3) the short-term benefits of avoiding admission tests should be weighed against the long-term disadvantage of not being able to apply credits earned towards a degree program until satisfactory admission test scores are earned. Where non-degree seeking students wish to change their classification to regular admission, they will be required to notify the Graduate Dean in writing and complete their admission package with letters of recommendation, appropriate GRE or GMAT scores, and all other required documents. Non-degree seeking students are only allowed to complete twelve (12) graduate credit hours under this status. Credits earned under this status will apply toward a degree if the student is later fully admitted to a SCHOOL OF GRADUATE STUDIES 300 degree-granting program; provided that the credit hours consist of graduate level courses, however. The courses must also be a part of the Plan of Study in the selected degree-granting program and an advisor in the graduate program, the graduate program director/chair, and the Graduate Dean must approve those courses. AUDITING COURSES Graduate students who wish to audit a course must obtain the approval of the instructor, the graduate program director/chair, and the Graduate Dean. The student must be enrolled or eligible to enroll in the University as a regular, visiting, or special student in order to be eligible to audit a course. A student who is allowed to audit a course must register for an audit classification and must pay the same tuition and fees as for academic credit enrollment. No student may receive academic credit for audited courses. Students who audit courses must understand that: No credit can be earned for an audited course. If examinations are taken, no credit can be awarded at a later date. No more than two courses may be audited in the same semester. Courses audited will be included in a student's course load calculation. \"AU\" will be posted as the grade for an audited course. Students who are not listed on the official class roll under an \"AUDIT\" status will not be allowed to sit in the class unofficially. RE-ENTRY Students who have interrupted their graduate program residence at SUNO, and have not registered for any regular semester, must file an application for re-entry and pay the appropriate fee. A student in attendance during the spring semester and not enrolled in the summer session, need not file for re-entry for the next fall semester. Degree students must submit supplemental transcripts if any work has been taken at another institution during the interim if they desire consideration of such work. Students who follow the University's procedures to withdraw voluntarily from a graduate program, and who are in good standing at the time of withdrawal, may re-enter no later than after one academic year and continue under the same curriculum policy which was in effect when they originally entered. The re-entry policies of the individual graduate degree programs must be adhered to by every student who returns . Students in good standing who return later than one academic year must re-apply and pay the appropriate application fee. These students are required to follow the curriculum policies in force at the time of re-entry. Students who voluntarily withdraw from SUNO while NOT in good standing, or those who have been asked to withdraw due to poor scholarship, must re-apply by submitting a full application packet. Such students are subject to the same levels of screening and admission committee reviews as are first time applicants. Students who are asked to withdraw for poor scholarship twice will not be considered for re-entry. Students who are expelled will be not be readmitted. In the case of suspensions for disciplinary actions, students who are expelled for only one semester may re-enter according to the policies of the individual degree program and must submit a new application for admission. If admitted, these students will return on probation. The terms of such SCHOOL OF GRADUATE STUDIES 301 probationary status are determined at the program level at the time of the suspension. TRANSFER STUDENTS Applicants transferring from other universities must meet all of the requirements for admission. Students with prior graduate coursework are allowed to request a transfer of credits, not to exceed twelve (12) credit hours. Courses requested for transfer must have been taken no longer than seven (7) years prior to the application for enrollment at SUNO. Only courses with an earned grade of B or better will be considered ( B- grades are not transferable). Students requesting a transfer must submit a Letter of Good Standing from their last college or university. This letter must include a statement that the student: (1) is not on probation; and, (2) has not been dismissed because of poor academic performance or other violations that are governed by a code of conduct. The SGS has no articulation agreements for courses at the graduate level with other Universities in the State of Louisiana at this time. Graduate credits may be transferred only from a regionally accredited university or college (a recognized university, if international). Acceptable transfer courses are limited to those in which a student has earned a grade of B or better. Transfer credits must not be more than seven (7) years old at the time of graduation (the date on which degree is awarded). Graduate programs are permitted to accept a limited number of graduate credit hours for transfer to satisfy the requirement for master's degrees. This must be done with the approval of the Graduate Dean and such transfers may not be used to satisfy the residency requirement. This policy applies to graduate work completed at SUNO and other accredited colleges and universities. In all instances where a transfer of credit is granted, it must be the considered judgment of the program faculty that the work is relevant and meets the same objectives as a comparable course in the SUNO program. Even though a course requested for transfer may be suitable and meet the criteria above, faculty may still reserve the right to require that the SUNO course(s) be taken. All transfers of credit from another institution require the recommendation of the degree program faculty and the approval of the graduate director and Graduate Dean. A grade of C may not be transferred for credit toward a graduate degree at SUNO. Also observe that: Graduate credits may be transferred only when they can be reconciled with the requirements of the student's chosen degree program. (1. Recommendation of Faculty, 2. Approval of Director/Chair, and 3. Approval of Dean) Only graduate level courses (500 level and above) may be transferred. Credits that were previously used toward a degree cannot be applied toward another degree. The total number of graduate credits that can be accepted for transfer can not exceed twelve (12) hours. A transfer of credit application form, official transcripts and a Plan of Study must be submitted to the School of Graduate Studies Dean for approval immediately after the initial advisement and assessment of the in-coming student's transcript. No transfer of credit request will be SCHOOL OF GRADUATE STUDIES 302 approved after the end of the first semester of a student's enrollment in a graduate degree program. Pass ( P)/Fail ( F) grades are not transferable unless it can be clearly substantiated for SUNO graduate faculty by the former institution that the P represents at least B quality work. TRANSFER OF GRADUATE CREDIT TAKEN AS A NON-DEGREE STUDENT TOWARD A GRADUATE DEGREE Graduate credit may only be transferred from a regionally accredited university or college (or a recognized institution in the case of international students) in courses in which a student has earned a grade of B or better. Those credits must not be older than seven (7) years at the time of graduation and may only be transferred when they can be reconciled with the requirements of the student's chosen graduate degree program. A maximum of twelve (12) semester hours of coursework that has been taken while the student was enrolled as a non-degree student may be transferred toward a degree at SUNO provided that they are graduate level (500 level or above) courses. Graduate credit will not be officially transferred without a fully executed application form, appropriate support documentation (official transcripts), an approved Plan of Study and the required approvals from the student's advisor and the graduate program director. The request to transfer credit must be submitted to the Dean of the School of Graduate Studies no later than the end of the first semester of enrollment in the graduate degree program. CREDIT BY EXAMINATION An examination to establish credit for work done in absentia or without formal class work may be used to remove undergraduate deficiencies, but not to earn credit towards an advanced degree. Arrangements are made by the student, the advisor and the program director through the SGS Office. The results of such examination must be certified by the professor under whom the course would have normally been taken. The examination must be given in a semester when the course is offered and the student must register for the course in order to receive credit. RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT At least two-thirds (2/3) of the hours required for a master's degree must be earned in residence at SUNO. Credits older than seven (7) years may not be used, nor may these credits be used to satisfy any part of this residency requirement. A student must be in residence in SUNO's SGS for at least two semesters in order to be recommended for a graduate degree. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS All work, including transferred credit, counted toward the master's degree must be completed during the seven (7) years immediately preceding the date on which the degree is awarded. THE SECOND MASTER'S DEGREE A student seeking a second master's degree may be allowed to apply credits from a previous degree SCHOOL OF GRADUATE STUDIES 303 program towards the requirements of a second graduate degree at SUNO with the approval of specific courses being recorded by the faculty in the second degree program. The specific stipulations are that the second degree must be different from the previous degree and that not more than twelve (12) semester hours of appropriate credit from the previous degree may be applied to the second degree. CONCURRENT REGISTRATION A graduate student registered at SUNO may not receive degree credit for any work taken concurrently at another college or university without prior approval of their academic advisor, their graduate program director/chair, and the Graduate Dean. Degree-seeking graduate students who wish to take courses at another college or university during a summer session, or during a regular semester when not enrolled at SUNO, must also obtain prior approval of their advisor, their program director/chair and the Graduate Dean. Any student interested in pursuing concurrent degrees at SUNO should discuss the proposed study with the Graduate Dean and the graduate program directors/chair prior to applying to the programs. If the request for concurrent enrollment is approved, the student must be officially admitted to both programs through regular procedures. If the student is approved to pursue two master's degree programs, no more than six (6) hours of coursework from one-degree program may be applied toward meeting the requirements for the second degree. These six (6) hours must be agreed to by the faculty in the second degree program through a petition submitted to the Graduate Dean. It is the responsibility of each graduate student pursuing continuing enrollment at SUNO to submit to the office of the Dean of the School of Graduate Studies an official transcript of work pursued elsewhere. SUNO will not grant credit for coursework taken by a student during any period of time in which the student was suspended or dismissed from any other college or university. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS Southern University at New Orleans offers a comprehensive program of financial aid to assist graduate students. The following federal and institutional programs are available through the University's Office of Financial Assistance: 1. Federal Perkins Loans 2. Federal Stafford Student Loans 3. Federal Work Study 4. Graduate Assistantships The University accepts the Free Application for Federal Student Aid for all types of Title IV financial aid. This packet is available through the Office of Student Financial Assistance. SCHOOL OF GRADUATE STUDIES 304 ASSISTANTSHIPS AND GUIDELINES The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) in its Criteria for Accreditation mandates that the GSP develop policies to govern the selection and evaluation and monitoring of graduate assistants (GAs). These policies include setting minimum academic qualifications for holding a GA appointment, creating a process for renewing an appointment, workload and stipend ranges, and procedures for the supervision of GAs within the employing graduate programs and by the office of the SGS. SUNO will offer teaching, research and service assistantships on a semester-by-semester basis as funds are available. Applications and supporting documents should be submitted to the appropriate graduate degree program in accordance with published deadlines. Only full time graduate students with regular admission status and acceptable academic records ( B average or better) will be appointed to assistantships. Students who are admitted on conditional or provisional status are not eligible to apply. International students must provide evidence of a current and valid Visa in order to be eligible, and must satisfy all other GA criteria established by the graduate degree program, the SGS and the University. Applications and information regarding the availability of assistantships can be obtained in the SGS Office and in various graduate degree program offices as funds become available. UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT IN GRADUATE PROGRAMS A SUNO undergraduate student who, in his/her final semester, is completing not more than six (6) hours toward a baccalaureate degree may be approved to take up to six (6) hours of graduate courses at the 500 level. Exceptions may apply if students are matriculating in a professional certification program. Courses at the 600 level are prohibited for any undergraduate student. This applies to undergraduate students who audit 600 level courses as well. Undergraduate students cannot be enrolled in 600 level courses even if they are not seeking graduate credit . Requirements for this include a cumulative GPA of 3.0, approval by the undergraduate faculty advisor, approval by the intended graduate program, approval of the professor(s) of the 500 level course(s) to be taken for graduate credit, and approval of the Graduate Dean. These approvals must be obtained prior to the beginning of the semester in which the undergraduate student seeks to enroll in graduate courses. If the undergraduate student earns at least a B while taking a graduate level course, the credit can be applied toward a graduate degree at SUNO if it has not already been used for undergraduate degree credit. Credit for such graduate work may also be transferred to another institution, provided the transfer of credit is approved by the graduate program selected by the student. Such transfer of credit requests must be made as soon as the student is admitted into a graduate program. It should be noted that permission to take graduate courses as an undergraduate student does not imply or in any way guarantee later admission into the graduate program. SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS FOR FINANCIAL AID/SCHOLARSHIPS POLICY This policy provides the framework for monitoring academic progress and eligibility determination for all federal, scholarship, and other aid programs. All graduate students receiving any financial aid or scholarships from SUNO must abide by this policy, as well as any specific requirements for SCHOOL OF GRADUATE STUDIES 305 scholarships or exemptions as applicable. This policy applies to all new, transfer, reentry, and continuing graduate students at SUNO, effective Fall 2001. General Guidelines - Students must be in good standing academically, and enrolled in an eligible curriculum. Students must also maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.0 and a total earned hours/pursued hours ratio in accordance with the Satisfactory Academic Progress Earned Hours/Pursued Hours Ratio Table which can be found in the front of this catalog under Financial Aid , in order to retain their financial aid eligibility. Earned/Pursued Hours Ratio and GPA Standard - Graduate students must earn at least two- thirds (2/3) of their hours pursued at SUNO and maintain an overall GPA of 3.0 in all coursework. WITHDRAWAL FROM COURSES AND THE UNIVERSITY The University publishes its yearly academic calendar which lists a period of time during which students may add or drop classes at the beginning of each semester. Students intending to add or drop courses must obtain the necessary signatures on the appropriate form found in the Registrar's office. Students may not add classes after the published deadline and will not be allowed to attend classes for which their names do not appear on the official roll. Students are only allowed to drop or add courses with the signatures of their advisors, the graduate program director and/or the college dean. If classes are dropped before the 14th day of the semester (7th day of the summer session), there will not be a listing of those courses on the student's record. When courses are dropped after the 14th day (7th day in summer), a W is recorded. In cases where a student drop all the classes they are registered for, the action is equivalent to resigning from the University and the appropriate Withdrawal Form must be executed. A student's intent to drop a course or withdraw from the University must be documented by his/her signature on the appropriate form which must be also signed by several University officials. Students who are withdrawing from the University must have their forms signed by the Dean of the School of Graduate Studies. When students simply stop attending one class or discontinue attendance in all classes, without filing a Withdrawal Form and clearing University accounts, an F will be posted to their transcripts for all classes appearing on their records that semester. Further, the right to a statement of honorable dismissal will be forfeited, thereby jeopardizing re-entrance to SUNO or transfer to another accredited institution. It is the student's responsibility to follow the required procedures and to meet the deadlines published by the University for dropping courses and withdrawing from the University. Failure to comply will usually result in a grade of F. INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS Prospective students who are citizens of countries other than the United States are particularly welcome in the SUNO School of Graduate Studies. An application for the SGS should be requested early and the request should contain information regarding the prospective student's citizenship SCHOOL OF GRADUATE STUDIES 306 status, country of birth, formal academic preparation, evidence of financial support, dependents, English language proficiency, standardized test scores and proposed area of graduate study. Transcripts from foreign institutions which are not in English must be translated and/or evaluated to determine appropriate United States bachelor's degree (or graduate) equivalencies. However, the applicant must submit both the official/original foreign transcript along with an official course-by-course transcript evaluation, preferably translated by the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers (AACRAO), One Dupont Circle NW, Suite 520, Washington, DC 20036, (202) 296-3359, oies@aacrao.org, or www.AACRO.com.

Box 745, Old Chelsea Station, New York, NY 10011, (212) 966-6395 or 800-937- 3895, info@wes.org, may also be used.] The fees for the required certified translations and evaluations must be paid by the applicant who should request that the translation and evaluation be mailed directly to: The Dean of the School of Graduate Studies, Southern University at New Orleans, 6400 Press Drive, New Orleans, LA 70126. International students will be required to have an earned bachelor's degree and the appropriate grade point average for the graduate program of choice. Fees must be submitted in U.S. currency. International students must present a minimum composite score of 500 on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), with at least 50 on the listening comprehension component. Individual programs may require higher scores. A student needing to take the TOEFL should write directly to: TOEFL, Educational Testing Service, Princeton, New Jersey 08540. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) has strict rules governing the enrollment and employment of international students. In general, the INS requires graduate students to be enrolled for a full course load as defined by the University. Applications from international students are due 90 days prior to the semester of desired initial entry. Upon notification of acceptance into the SGS, prospective students who are not already in the United States will receive a letter of admission and an immigration document (SEVIS Form I-20). In compliance with the current student reporting regulation - 8 CRF 214.2(f), 214.2(m) and 214.3, students must report to the Office of International Student Services in order to be officially entered in SEVIS once they arrive in New Orleans. The SGS considers an applicant an international student if the applicant currently holds or will hold F- 1 (student) of J-1 (exchange visitor) visa status. Students requiring a student visa may not be admitted on probation or provisionally. The U. S. Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service, the agency that governs non-immigrant F-1 students, requires international students in this category to pursue a full course of study while maintaining non-immigrant student status. Under this regulation, a graduate student must register for a minimum of six (6) semester hours of coursework in a degree program. F-1 Transfer Students All F-1 transfer students already in the United States must show proof of their visa status. A completed VISA CLEARANCE FORM signed by their current International Student Advisor must be submitted to the SGS in addition to the academic transcripts, evidence of financial support, and health records. It is the responsibility of all F-1 students to maintain their student visa status. For admission, all international students must: SCHOOL OF GRADUATE STUDIES 307 meet the minimum academic requirements for admission to the SGS (i.e., a bachelor's degree or its equivalent from an accredited institution); submit evidence of proficiency in the English language; present a statement of financial responsibility; provide three (3) letters of recommendation from administrators or professors in the college or university from which the applicant holds a bachelor's degree; and submit official scores on the standardized test (GRE, GMAT, etc.) required by the individual graduate degree program. International students who have entered the United States on an I-20 issued by another institution will not be considered for admission unless it can be shown that the student was previously enrolled at the institution issuing the I-20. FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT In accordance with the Family Education Right and Privacy Act of 1974 (P. L. 93-380), Section 513, amending the General Education Provisions Act, Section 438, students enrolled at SUNO are hereby informed of their right of access to their official records as described in the Act. If additional information is desired contact the Office of the Registrar. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act defines the term \"directory information\" to include the student's name, address, telephone listing, date and place of birth, major field of study, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, weight and height of members of athletic teams, dates of attendance, degrees and awards received, the most recent previous educational agency or institution attended by the student. The University will make public, information about each student limited to these categories in ways such as those described above. Students, who do not wish to have any or all of such \"directory information\" made public without prior consent, must notify the Office of the Registrar, SUNO of this fact in a signed and dated statement specifying items that are not to be published. This notice must be received by the Office of the Registrar by the end of the registration period of the semester or summer session of first enrollment, or after an absence and re-enrollment, and by the end of each fall registration period thereafter. The student is to notify the Dean of the SGS that such a request has been made to the Registrar by forwarding a copy of the original request. STUDENT RECORDS Final grades for each semester are officially recorded and filed in the Office of the Registrar. Grade reports are submitted to students, parents or guardians at the end of each semester. However, approximately 10 days will be required to post grades and issue transcripts for students who have completed courses and wish this work to be included on their transcripts. Graduates of the University are given their first transcripts free of charge. A written request and a fee is required for each additional transcript. Transcripts cannot be released until all debts to the University are paid in full. Student Records Regulations - Campuses comprising the Southern University System shall comply fully with regulations of Section 438, Privacy Rights of Parents and Students, of the General Education Provisions Act. This insures students' access to their educational records maintained by the University, and prohibits the release of personally identifiable information except as specified by the law. The Chancellor shall inform students of the rights accorded them by law. SCHOOL OF GRADUATE STUDIES 308 To gain access to their academic records, students must submit written requests or present themselves to the Office of the Registrar. Personally identifiable information from educational records cannot be released without the student's permission except: to University personnel who have legitimate educational interests as determined by the University; to other educational institutions in which the student seeks to enroll (the student may obtain a copy of the record that was transferred); to public agencies as specified in the General Education Provisions Act; to agencies requesting records in connection with the student's application for financial aid; to accrediting agencies; to parents of students who are dependents for income tax purposes; to courts of law in response to court orders or subpoenas. Policies governing disciplinary procedures for the University are included in the Code of Student Conduct manual, available in the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs. Requests for access to educational records by any person other than the graduate student shall be refused unless the student has submitted a written, dated, and signed waiver to allow access to the records. The waiver must specify the records to be released, the reasons for the release, and the names of persons to whom records should be released. Change of Name and/or Address - If after being admitted to the SGS, a student's name, address, or other contact information changes, he/she MUST report that change to their degree program office and the SGS. Any communication from the University bearing the name and address on file is considered to be properly delivered. GENERAL INFORMATION & POLICIES It is the responsibility of the graduate student to be informed of and to observe all regulations and procedures required by the SGS as well as the program the student is pursuing. The student must be familiar with those sections of the University Catalog that outline general policies, regulations and requirements, specific degree program and department requirements, and the requirements of the SGS. A student's lack of knowledge of a rule will not constitute a basis for waiving that rule. Any exception to the policies stated in the University Catalog requires the approval of the Graduate Dean. After admission to the SGS, but before the first registration, a student should consult the faculty advisor and/or the graduate program director/chair in the major department concerning course transfers, degree requirements, and special regulations of the department. All Plans of Study , courses, and class schedules require the approval of the director of the graduate program and the student's designated advisor. Faculty Advisors - Once an applicant has been cleared for admission into the SGS, the application is then forwarded to the degree program of the applicant's choice for admission consideration. Upon acceptance for admission to a degree program, each student is assigned a faculty advisor from the appropriate field of concentration. The faculty advisor will assist the student in planning a program and schedule; however, the student must assume responsibility for meeting all requirements. Student Responsibilities - It is the responsibility of the student to become thoroughly acquainted SCHOOL OF GRADUATE STUDIES 309 with all graduate regulations including admission and degree requirements. All graduate students should also become familiar with all departmental and programmatic policies. Students enrolling in graduate courses must possess satisfactory prerequisite experiences for each course taken. Students must consult their advisors and the course instructors prior to enrollment in any courses. Class Attendance Policy - Class attendance is regarded as an obligation as well as a privilege. All students are expected to attend, regularly and punctually, all classes, seminars, conferences, and workshops scheduled unless prevented from doing so by unforeseen circumstances. Students experiencing such circumstances should contact their course instructor immediately. Failure to do so may seriously jeopardize a student's academic standing. Each instructor will maintain a permanent attendance record for each class. These records are subject to inspection by appropriate University officials. Each instructor shall report to the Director of the Program/Chair all cases of absences which will, in the opinion of the instructor, jeopardize the student's chance of satisfactorily completing the course. Students who miss classes, seminars, conferences and/or workshops are responsible for obtaining the material covered in the lectures or other class sessions. Students will be allowed to make up missed exams or other course requirements at the instructor's discretion. Again, class attendance is regarded as an obligation as well as a privilege. Students who miss two classes are required to meet with the course instructor immediately to explain the reasons for missing class. It is the student's responsibility to set up the meeting with the instructor. In such cases, students should be aware that the instructor has the right to adjust the student's grade or not, depending on the instructor's assessment of the student's reasons for missing class. Such an action will be based on the student's academic performance as well as reasons for absences. Faculty members are required to state in writing and explain to students at the beginning of each semester and summer session, their policy in regard to tardiness, absences and missed work. Students are responsible for all missed work, regardless of the reason for the absence. If a student does not officially withdraw from a class, any absences before official withdrawal will be recorded and will become a part of the student's permanent record. Excessive Absences - Instructors are required to inform the School of Graduate Studies office of any student whose potential to successfully complete a graduate course is jeopardized by frequent and/or unexplained absences. The Dean of the Graduate Studies Program will contact these students to inform them of the above Class Attendance Policy and to urge them to immediately schedule an appointment with their instructor to discuss the absences. Student Conduct - Graduate students are subject to the same rules of behavior that govern undergraduates. Administrative regulations governing the conduct of students enrolled at SUNO are contained in the Graduate Student Handbook. Included in that publication are rules and regulations governing students' rights and responsibilities, the University Judicial System, disciplinary sanctions, penalties, violations, and types of offenses. Student Academic Grievance Procedure - When a student has a grievance that he/she feels cannot be settled in a normal out-of-class discussion, the following steps are strongly recommended: SCHOOL OF GRADUATE STUDIES 310 1. Discuss the problem with the instructor. 2. Discuss the problem with the director/chair of the degree program. 3. Discuss the problem with the college/school dean. 4. If the problem has not been satisfactorily resolved after the above three steps, the student may make written appeal to the Graduate Dean, who, if unable to resolve the matter, will refer it in writing to the Graduate Council for review and recommendation to the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs. Student academic appeals must be filed by the end of the next regular semester after the grievance occurred. The Graduate Grading System - A grade is assigned solely on the basis of the instructor's assessment and learned judgment of the student's scholarly attainment. Graduate students are assigned a grade of A, B, C, D , or F on coursework. No graduate credit toward a degree is earned for a grade less than C. The SGS adheres to the quality point system of four points per semester hour for an A, three for a B, two for a C, one for a D, and none for an F. The only passing grades for graduate work are an A or a B. A maximum of two grades below a B are acceptable for credit toward a graduate degree as long as the overall cumulative grade point average meets the B average requirement and there are no failing ( F) grades. D grades indicate unacceptable graduate work and all courses to be counted towards a graduate degree in which a D is earned must be repeated. F grades indicate FAILURE and work which is grossly unworthy of any credit and suggest that the student may not be capable of succeeding in graduate study. Another grade which may be posted on the student's transcript is the W which indicates that the student withdrew from a course on or before the date announced by the University as the last date for withdrawals without risk of penalty. A cumulative grade point average of 3.0 ( B) is required for graduation. At the discretion of a given degree program, a grade of B or better may be required for one or more particular courses or a sequence of courses. Courses with D or F grades do not earn any credit toward the master's degree. Students who earn a grade of C in more than two (2) courses with credits in excess of nine (9) hours will be suspended from the SGS for one semester and required to obtain the approval of the graduate program director/chair and the Graduate Dean in order to re-enroll on a probationary status. Incomplete ( I) Grade Policy - Graduate coursework which is of passing quality but which, because of circumstances beyond the students' control, is not complete, may be marked I (incomplete) . It is not to be given to enable a student to do additional work to bring up a deficient grade. It is the responsibility of the student to initiate the excuse by petitioning the instructor in writing and listing the unusual circumstance which necessitates the I. The petition must be presented to the instructor prior to the deadline for submitting grades to the Registrar. If a petition is not received prior to the deadline, the instructor is to consider the delinquent work as being of failing quality and an I grade is not to be given. (The instructor will calculate the grade without the missing work and post it on the grade sheet accordingly.) Upon receipt of the petition for an I, the instructor should identify, in writing, all delinquent work which must be completed, along with any special instructions, in order to change the grade later. The instructor, the student, and the graduate program director/chair must sign in acceptance of the SCHOOL OF GRADUATE STUDIES 311 petition for the I grade. The I can only be removed by the completion of the work identified in the petition and agreed to by all parties. A grade of I carries no quality points and has the effect of lowering the student's overall grade point average until it is replaced with a regular grade. The I becomes an F if it is not removed by the end of the 45th day of the following semester. NOTE: A student should not re-enroll in a course in which an incomplete grade was received. Students who have been given an I cannot be cleared for graduation until the delinquency has been satisfied. Undergraduate Courses Taken by Graduate Students - All grades earned in undergraduate courses that are taken by a graduate student are calculated in the graduate grade point average. Such courses are not generally applicable to requirements for a graduate degree, but may be taken as prerequisites to graduate level courses which are required. Where an undergraduate course is taken, either as a prerequisite or as an elective, the minimum grade acceptable grade will be a B. Academic Good Standing - A graduate student is in good standing and is considered to be making satisfactory progress if a 3.0 semester cumulative grade point average is earned in all graduate courses. No grade below C will be accepted for graduate degree credit. Where students earn F grades , even though their GPAs do not fall below 3.0, they are automatically suspended for one semester and will only be allowed to re-enroll on a probationary status. For students who earn F grades and their GPAs fall below 3.0, the determination of the students standing and continuation in the degree program will be made by the faculty in that program. Two (2) options are available to the faculty: (1) to recommend suspending the students for one semester and requiring them to repeat the course once they are allowed by the program director/chair and the Graduate Dean to re-enroll; or, (2) to recommend expelling the students without benefit of probation or suspension. All available information must be used to support the faculty's conclusion that the student who earned an F is incapable of continuing and succeeding in the graduate program. Where such conclusion is derived, a recommendation to expel the student must be submitted to the Graduate Dean. Changing Grades - A grade assigned for work in a course is not usually subject to change. Exceptions may be considered in case of a specific error that may be documented and corrected. Any change of grade must be initiated on the required form available in the Office of the Registrar by the instructor who originally assigned the grade. Grades that have been submitted to the Office of the Registrar can be changed only by submitting the official Change of Grade Form certifying that an error was made in recording the grade. Grades should not be changed after the semester (or summer session) because a student takes an examination previously missed and/or submits course requirements after the official completion of a course. An instructor's acceptance of late material constitutes extending the semester and is not allowed. A change of grade is based on some error in calculation/recordation and must be approved by the graduate program director/chair and the Dean of the Graduate Studies before the Registrar will make changes on the student's record. Any grade change must be received in the Office of the Registrar no later than 60 calendar days immediately following the beginning of classes in the semester following the one in which the grade was given or omitted. For a Summer session, the changes are due in the Office of the Registrar no later than sixty (60) calendar days immediately following the beginning of classes in the succeeding Fall semester. If a student is not enrolled the following semester, then the grade change is due sixty (60) calendar days following the beginning of classes in the next semester in which the student is enrolled. SCHOOL OF GRADUATE STUDIES 312 Course Numbers - Courses numbered 500 and above are limited to graduate students, except for those undergraduate students who, as explained in the section above entitled Undergraduate Enrollment in a Graduate Program , are allowed to take graduate courses near the completion of their undergraduate degree programs. Those courses that are numbered 600 and above are primarily designated for advanced graduate students. Undergraduate courses numbered 100-399 may not be used to satisfy the requirements of a graduate degree program at any time. Where 400 level courses are required as a prerequisite to full or conditional admission into a graduate degree program, the requirement must be written as a part of the student's approved Plan of Study; the specific course(s) must be identified by title and number and the requirement must be limited to a maximum of two undergraduate courses used for graduate credit . This catalog contains a complete list of approved graduate courses. Individual graduate degree programs reserve the right to decide when to offer each of these courses. Course Load Limits -The University operates on a semester system consisting of two sixteen-week periods and an eight-week summer session. One credit under the semester system is equal to 1.5 quarter credits. Students enrolled for six (6) hours during a regular semester are considered as having a full-time course load. The minimum for summer sessions is three (3) credit hours. The maximum course load for a full-time, non-working student registered in a master's degree program during a regular semester is twelve (12) semester hours. Students wishing to enroll for more than twelve (12) credit hours must obtain approval from their graduate faculty advisor and the director of the program. The maximum course load for students registered for graduate study during any single summer session is one semester hour for each week of the session. Plan of Study - The degree requirements for each graduate program is determined by the faculty in that program and must b approved by the Graduate Council and the curriculum committee. The graduate degree program in which the student is enrolled shall specify the program's additional requirements for each of its students. Approval for Additional Courses - Students may not receive graduate degree credit for courses that are not contained in their Plan of Study and which are not dully authorized for this purpose by the faculty of their degree program faculty and the Graduate Dean. Independent Study - Individual graduate degree programs may offer an opportunity for students to complete a course through individual instruction/independent study. This is not allowed for those courses designated as \" core\" or foundational courses and should not be considered for those courses which constitute the first twelve hours of credit in a student's program of study. An independent study must be agreed to by the instructor of record for the course and approved by the student's advisor and the director/chair of the graduate program. Maximum six (6) hours. Academic Standards - The minimum standard for graduate work leading to a graduate degree is a 3.0 grade point average in the overall program of courses pursued and in the major field with no more than two grades below a B. A C grade must be offset by an A in a course of the same number of credit hours. All work pursued, even undergraduate courses taken as requirements or electives while enrolled as a graduate student will be calculated as part of a student's graduate grade SCHOOL OF GRADUATE STUDIES 313 point average. A student whose cumulative average is below B (3.00) or whose semester average is below B will be placed on academic probation at the end of the semester in which it occurs. The probationary status must be removed by achieving a cumulative and/or semester average of B during the next enrollment session. Two consecutive unsuccessful probationary periods will result in a suspension wherein the student must remain out of school for one regular semester. However, any graduate student whose cumulative and/or semester average falls below 2.5 will be suspended from the University without a probationary period. Reinstatement after one semester must be approved by the graduate program director/chair and the Graduate Dean. If suspended twice, the student will not be eligible for readmission. A graduate student may be denied further registration in a graduate program when the student's scholastic performance or progress toward completion of the planned program has not been maintained at a B average level in all work attempted, or when the student's performance is defined by the faculty as being unsatisfactory scholarship. Disciplinary action will be taken against a student with unsatisfactory scholarship. Such actions can include probation, suspension, or exclusion. Academic Conduct - Cheating and plagiarism are not tolerated. If it can be established that a violation of this nature has occurred, the student will receive an automatic F in the course in which the offense occurred and a letter will be placed in his/her official record in the SGS Office. A second offense will result in expulsion from the degree program. All charges of this nature must, however, first be brought before the Graduate Council for review and disposition. Academic Probation - Graduate students, full-time or part-time, will be placed on probation if: the student's cumulative graduate grade point average is below 2.5 at the of time admission. If admitted on probation, a student must make a 3.0 grade point average in each semester in which the first nine hours of graduate work is completed or the student will be expelled from the SGS. the student's cumulative graduate grade point average for undergraduate or graduate work falls below a 3.0 during graduate enrollment. (Should the cumulative average be below 3.0 for two consecutive semesters, the student may be expelled from the School of Graduate Studies. For this purpose the summer session is considered a regular semester. ) the student earns more than two grades below B during enrollment. (Failure to meet specific academic performance standards established by the School of Graduate Studies and/or the individual graduate degree programs may also result in academic suspension.) Students on academic probation will not be allowed to register for courses in the final year of graduate study, receive scholarships, assistantships, or register for more than a total of six (6) graduate credit hours. Full time students admitted to a graduate program on academic probation must achieve a 3.0 cumulative GPA by the end of the first two (2) semesters in order to continue graduate study. Students placed on probation while enrolled in a graduate program must acquire a 3.0 cumulative GPA by the end of the next semester. Students who fail to meet the conditions of a probationary status will be recommended to the Dean of the School of Graduate Studies for suspension up to two times, after which expulsion is automatic.SCHOOL OF GRADUATE STUDIES 314 Suspension - A student who is placed on probation for two consecutive periods, will be suspended if a GPA of 3.0 is not achieved by the end of the second probationary period. A student who is placed on suspension must remain out of school (and will not be allowed to register) for the semester or summer session immediately following such suspension. A student who is placed on suspension will not be allowed to register after the suspension without approval from the graduate program director/chair and the Graduate Dean. Students who return after a one-semester suspension are allowed to re-enroll under a Probationary status ONLY, and are expected to meet all the terms of probation once they are re-admitted. Expulsion - A student who has been placed on suspension for two consecutive periods and has failed to meet the 3.0 GPA requirements, will not be eligible for readmission into the program from which he/she was suspended after the second suspension. A student who is expelled from a graduate program is ineligible for readmission to the program from which he/she was expelled, and will not be allowed to register or be readmitted to the program unless there are verifiable extenuating circumstances and: (a) he/she submits a written appeal to the Graduate Council; (b) that appeal is successful and the Graduate Council permits the student to be readmitted. Academic Appeals - Students may appeal an expulsion only if the expulsion is the first one and the student is able to provide relevant documentation of extenuating circumstances to off-set the expulsion. The appeal is directed to the Graduate Council and, following review and a possible hearing, the Council will make a recommendation to the Graduate Dean for final disposition. Interruptions of Enrollment - A student who, of his/her own accord, interrupts his/her enrollment for two consecutive regular semesters (Fall and Spring) will have their matriculation closed and will need to reapply for admission into the SGS when they are ready to return. Readmission - Any student who desires to be readmitted to the University after being expelled for academic reasons, exclusive of failure of the comprehensive examination or of the oral defense of the thesis, capstone or final projects, must first complete a SGS application. Students must submit a written request for readmission to the SGS Dean, and the director/chair of the graduate program in which they were formally enrolled. If the readmission is approved, reinstatement may require students to fulfill special conditions formulated by the graduate program faculty and approved by the SGS Dean, who shall then notify students of such conditions. A student who fails the comprehensive examination or the final oral examination in defense of the thesis, capstone, or final project a second time will be dropped from the SGS. When dropped for either of these reasons, the student will not be readmitted to the SGS. Student/Faculty Grievances - When a student or a faculty member has a grievance which cannot be settled in a brief after class discussion, the following steps are strongly recommended: The instructor should schedule a conference with the student at a mutually acceptable time SCHOOL OF GRADUATE STUDIES 315 within ten (10) working days of the inception of the alleged problem. If unresolved after the previous step, the matter should be brought to the attention of the graduate program director/chair, in writing, to express the faculty and student positions. If a decision cannot be reached upon the director's review of the facts, he/she should appoint a committee of program faculty and students to review and resolve the matter within ten working days. The next appeal is to the College or School Academic Dean. If no resolution is reached at this level, the matter should be brought to the Dean of the SGS with a summary of previous steps taken. The Dean will refer the matter to the Graduate Council. As a final academic review, if the matter cannot (or appropriately should not) be resolved by the Graduate Council, it will be presented to the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs with the Council's recommendation within sixty (60) days of the Council's receipt of the grievance. It is suggested that deliberate attempts be made by faculty to resolve matters without using this process. When this remedy is invoked to solve student/faculty grievances, the goal at all steps will be to arrive at a solution which is mutually acceptable and beneficial. Change of Major or Program - A graduate student who wishes to change his/her major or program must submit a formal application through the SGS after receiving the approval of the appropriate graduate program director/chair (the student's current department and desired new department). Approval must be obtained prior to making the change. Upon approval, a student may enroll in courses in the chosen new graduate degree program. However, students who change program/major should note the following: Requests for all changes (including curriculum, program, degree, etc.) must be submitted to the Graduate Dean at least one semester prior to the date of graduation. A maximum of six (6) credit hours of coursework pursued before the change of major/program may be used to satisfy the requirements for the new program, only if those hours are applicable to the new plan of study. For graduation and other purposes, students who change their majors/programs, will be evaluated using the University Catalog and SGS policies and regulations that are in force at the time of the change. Repeating a Course - Generally, a student may repeat a graduate course only once for credit. When a course is repeated at SUNO or at another college or university (if approved by SUNO's graduate faculty), hours pursued, hours earned, and quality points of previous attempts are excluded from the calculation of cumulative averages. When a student repeats a course for credit, the last grade earned is the official grade and both grades will appear on the transcript. Students repeating courses must identify such courses on their registration forms or on the Plan of Study change forms. However, courses designated with variable credit hours ( e.g. 3-9 credit hours) may be repeated for credit up to the maximum number of credit hours indicated for those respective courses. Variable credits are primarily allowed for courses such as thesis, clinical, practicum, etc. Course Substitution - Substitutions of courses in a student's approved Plan of Study may be permitted upon the written approval of the student's advisor, the graduate program director/chair, and the Dean of the School of Graduate Studies. A request for course substitutions must be SCHOOL OF GRADUATE STUDIES 316 submitted on forms designated for this purpose, and a copy must be submitted to the SGS Office. In general, when substitutions involved coursework being transferred from another program or institution, the decision of the faculty to accept a substitution MUST be made during the initial assessment of the incoming student's transcript and the recording of the student's Plan of Study . Students who wish to request course substitutions should be aware of the following: Three typed copies of the request must be fully completed. The student, the student's advisor, the graduate program director/chair must sign all copies before being submitted to the SGS Office. Undergraduate courses below the 500 level cannot be substituted for graduate courses at the 500 level or above, except in special cases where appropriate supporting documentation can be provided by the course instructor to the effect that a 400 level course involved graduate level content. This fact must be agreed upon by the graduate instructor of the course being substituted and the program director/chair. And, this provision is limited to a maximum of two courses, six (6) credit hours , to be substituted for graduate credit. The content of the substituted course must be comparable to the required course. Three copies of the course outline, catalog description, or syllabus of both the substitution course and the course being substituted must be attached to the request for course substitution. The number of credit hours for the substitution course must be equal to or greater than the number of credit hours for the course being substituted ( e.g. a two-credit hours course cannot be substituted for a three credit hours course). When the substitution involves a course which has not yet been taken, the requests for substitution must be submitted for approval prior to the substitution course being taken. It is suggested that requests be submitted no later than one month prior to the beginning of the semester in which the student intends to take the substitution course. No retroactive substitutions will be permitted. Poor planning and/or the desire to graduate in a certain semester is not an acceptable reason/excuse to violate the above or any other SGS policies and procedures. Requirements for Master's Degrees The Master of Arts degree is awarded to qualified candidates in the criminal justice, and museum studies programs. The Master of Science degree is awarded to candidates in management information systems. The Master of Social Work degree is awarded to candidates in the graduate social work program. The following regulations represent the minimum and general requirements of the SGS. Colleges and graduate programs may have additional regulations beyond those stated below. Therefore, satisfaction of the minimum requirements of the SGS, as stipulated in this catalog, does not relieve graduate students of the responsibility for satisfying any additional requirements of the degree programs in which they are enrolled. Unless otherwise indicated in the following sections concerning SCHOOL OF GRADUATE STUDIES 317 master's degrees, these general regulations apply to all master's degree programs at SUNO. Course Requirements - The Plan of Study or the course work for a master's degree is the under the direction and control of the graduate faculty in a graduate program. Each student must have his/her Plan of Study approved by the advisor and the graduate program director. No more than six (6) credits from a previous master's degree program may be applied toward a second master's degree. These credits are applied only with the written approval of the Graduate Dean and the graduate faculty and director/chair of the second (new) graduate degree program. Degree Requirements - Unless otherwise specified, for any master's degree, the student must: Successfully complete a minimum of 36 semester credit hours of graduate work, 33 hours of which must be in coursework, if the thesis, capstone, final project option is chosen. For programs not requiring a thesis, capstone, or final project, and for students selecting the non- thesis option in lieu of a thesis, capstone, final project, the minimum requirement is 36 semester credit hours of course work (excluding credit hours for special projects in some programs). Utilize a maximum of two 400-level undergraduate courses to meet the degree requirement provided these two courses meet the conditions set forth in the graduate program curriculum, and provided that the courses are approved when the student is admitted into the graduate degree program. All 400-level courses that will be used toward the student's degree must be specifically named and numbered on the student's approved Plan of Study . Take any undergraduate-level courses that are prescribed as a prerequisite to full admission into a graduate degree program within the first twelve (12) hours of enrollment. This prescription should be written on the student's Plan of Study and enforced by the advisor with oversight of the program director/chair. Earn a minimum cumulative Grade Point Average of 3.0 while enrolled in SGS. Earn no more than two grades below B while enrolled in the SGS. Various factors may make it necessary for students to take more than the minimum number of credits before they satisfactorily complete the requirements for the degree. Admission to Degree Candidacy - Admission to graduate program does not automatically make a student a formal candidate for the Master's degree. Students are admitted to candidacy when they have unconditionally completed all of the requirements for a master's degree with a B average, except the thesis, capstone, final project or comprehensive examination. Before students can be admitted to candidacy they must have: Completed an Admission to Candidacy Form which is available from the SGS Office, which must include a list of the graduate courses completed, being taken and yet to be pursued in their field. Passed all courses and have no I grades remaining on the transcript. Have received approval of a thesis, capstone or final project subject. SCHOOL OF GRADUATE STUDIES 318 Received the recommendation of the graduate program faculty for candidacy. Secure the approval of the Graduate Dean. Admission to candidacy must be achieved at the beginning of the semester in which the student plans to graduate. Candidacy for a master's degree shall be valid for no more than three (3) academic years. Any student seeking renewal of candidacy must apply to the SGS through the graduate program for readmission. The graduate program director and the student's advisor shall determine the conditions under which the student may be reinstated, subject to the approval of the SGS Dean. The responsibility for fulfilling these requirements on time is that of the student. Students should consult their program advisors if in doubt as to any additional requirements of their graduate program. Students will be required to observe carefully the specific requirements of their programs and those of SGS relative to admission/readmission to candidacy; they must regard programmatic requirements as additional to these general requirements. Other Requirements ( Thesis/Non-Thesis Option) - Master's degree programs may include both a \"thesis option\" (capstone, final project) and a \"non-thesis option\" (comprehensive examination), provided that each option has been set forth in writing, and approved by the Graduate Council and University Curriculum Committee. The overall level of achievement for a master's degree should be the same, whether the option chosen requires completion of a thesis, capstone or final project or a comprehensive examination. The thesis option is recommended for those students wishing to conduct original research and perhaps pursue a doctoral degree in the future. Under a thesis, capstone, final project option, 30 to 33 semester credits are completed in regular coursework and 3 to 6 credits are earned in the completion of the thesis, capstone, and final project process. The non-thesis option is intended for students and/or working professionals, who elect to, complete the total credit hour requirement of their degree program through actual coursework. The student who selects the non-thesis option must pass a comprehensive written examination on the major field of study. A comprehensive examination and a minimum of 36 semester credit hours of coursework are required with this option. With this option, the student must register for the comprehensive examination in the semester in which it will be taken. Listed as a course, no credit hours are associated with the comprehensive examination and either a P or an F is recorded on the student's transcript at the conclusion of the examination. If not passed, the examination can be repeated one (1) time. It is important to note that the non-thesis option is expected to be viewed as a thesis with a little less originality and depth. When the faculty in an academic unit currently offering a master's program which includes a thesis requirement wishes to add a non-thesis option, a statement should be transmitted to the Graduate Dean, for approval by the Graduate Council, describing in some detail the reason for requesting the non-thesis option, its aims and objectives, its courses and other significant requirements, and the proportion of master's students expected to enroll for each option. Conversely, when a faculty offering a non-thesis master's program wishes to offer a thesis option, similar information should be transmitted. SCHOOL OF GRADUATE STUDIES 319 Supervisory Committee - Supervisory committees for graduate degree programs act on behalf of the SGS and are utilized to guide and ensure the academic quality of the final requirements for a master's degree. These requirements generally are agreed to be the research, writing, examination, and publication of a thesis, capstone project, final problem project, or comprehensive examination. Supervisory committees are chosen by the student and the graduate program director/chair and must be approved by the Graduate Dean prior to the student's completion of the final twelve (12) hours of credit in his/her degree program. Committees must consist of a minimum of five members, with at least two possessing or being eligible for graduate faculty status. The chairperson of the committee must be from the student's graduate degree program. Generally, a chairperson also possesses expertise in the focus area to be investigated by the student. The dean of the SGS is an ex-officio member of all supervisory committees. It is strongly recommended that one member of the committee be selected from a field external to the student's degree program and or to the University, preferably a practitioner active in the field of study. The duties of the supervisory committee are to advise the student's research, to check on the student's adherence to degree requirements and deadlines, to supervise the overall preparation and content of the thesis, capstone, or final project. Each member of the committee is responsible for fully reviewing and approving both the process and the final document (i.e. the thesis or its equivalent). Final approval of the thesis or its equivalent in all aspects is the responsibility of the full committee acting on behalf of the SGS. The committee must ensure that the final research project incorporates evidence of the student's synthesis of overall program content and of the intended outcome skills. The committee must conduct the final oral examination on the student's research and attend to the overall scholarly quality of the process and the final product. The supervisory committee for a master's degree without a thesis, a comprehensive examination committee, may consist of one faculty person who will supervise the construction and scoring of the examination, and three members from the student's graduate degree program who have taught the student, and who agree to submit questions from the subject areas they taught the student and all must agree to read and score the entire examination. The duties of the comprehensive examination supervisory committee are: to check on the student's adherence to the degree requirements and deadlines; to submit examination questions which will allow the student to demonstrate mastery of course and program content; to assure that the overall examination is a comprehensive representation of the total degree program's content; to ensure that the examination's total processes will allow a student to demonstrate mastery of the skills intended by the degree program; to conduct a fair evaluation of the student's responses to the examination questions; and to attend to the overall scholarly quality of the process. The results of the examination will be submitted to the SGS Office. The Thesis, Capstone, Final Project Document - The document shall be prepared in accordance with the standards set within the graduate degree program in accordance with the conventions of the discipline, and must be produced by word processor. Every document submitted must conform to the specifications detailed in the manual published by the SGS. The Oral Defense - Every student who prepares a thesis, capstone, or final project in fulfillment of the requirements of their degree program shall be required to sit in defense of its contents before the supervisory committee and other interested faculty and students. The Comprehensive Examination - When a program offers the graduate student an option to complete a final research project (thesis, capstone, final project) or take a comprehensive SCHOOL OF GRADUATE STUDIES 320 examination, if the examination is selected, its exact format will be determined by the faculty of the student's graduate program of study. This exam must consist minimally of three (3) essay questions valued at a total of 50% and some combination of objective assessment tasks valued at 50% of the total examination weight. The process may or may not include an oral examination format; but when included, such format should not reduce the weight of the written portion of the examination. Each graduate program will establish its own format and must publish it as a part of its Graduate Student Handbook. Once established, format changes should be considered during scheduled program and curriculum reviews and then published for students. Students must pass a final comprehensive examination with a score equivalent to a B or better . The examination, held on campus with all participants present, will cover the degree program's core curriculum and the candidate's field of concentration. In no case may the comprehensive examination be scheduled earlier than the term proceeding the semester in which the degree is to be conferred to ensure that a candidate has completed the courses in all content areas which make the examination a comprehensive assessment. Students who fail the examination for the first time will be allowed to sit for a second examination provided that the second examination does not come earlier than two (2) months from the date of the previous examination. Failure to pass the examination after a second attempt will result in the student being dropped from the degree program and SGS. Change from Thesis to Non-Thesis Option - A student who wishes to change from the thesis to the non-thesis option for the master's degree mus t obtain the permission of his/her advisor and the graduate program director/chair, and supervisory committee if it is already constituted, to make such a change. This permission must be forwarded to the SGS Dean for approval at least one full semester prior to the intended date of graduation. The candidate must meet all the requirements of the non-thesis option as specified above. A maximum of three (3) credits for a thesis can be counted toward the degree requirements with a non-thesis option change. In addition, the supervising committee must certify that the work (the three credits of thesis) was productive in and of itself and warrants a grade of a B or better. The Catalog - The catalog that determines the curricular requirements for a graduate degree is the catalog in effect at the time of a student's admission into the SGS and the graduate degree program. Each candidate for a graduate degree must fulfill the requirements of the program curriculum in which the graduate degree is expected. A minimum of a B average must be earned in the student's graduate program of study. Exception to this policy will occur when external agencies add additional requirements that all graduates must meet (e.g. the Board of Regents, the Louisiana Legislature, accreditation agencies, etc.). Under no circumstances may a catalog more than seven (7) years old be used. Students, whose enrollment, at SUNO or elsewhere, is interrupted (either voluntarily or involuntarily) for at least two consecutive semesters, will be subject to the catalog in effect at the time of re-entry. Students, who are unable to complete a graduate degree program within seven years after entering the University, if allowed to continue, will be expected to follow the catalog in effect during their seven year of attendance. A student wishing to graduate under a catalog different from that specified by this policy must submit a written request (appeal) to the SGS Dean. This appeal should be endorsed by the advisor, and the graduate program director. Only exceptional cases with extenuating circumstances will be considered. SCHOOL OF GRADUATE STUDIES 321 The student is responsible for obtaining written approval from the academic advisor, the graduate program and director for any deviation from the approved curriculum and from the program requisites for the degree sought. Application for the Degree - An application for a degree must be approved in the Office of the SGS and filed in the Registrar's Office during the registration period of the semester in which degree requirements for graduation are to be completed. Prior to submission to the Graduate Dean, each application must bear the signatures of the student, the advisor, the director of the degree program, and/or the dean of the college/school in which the degree program is housed. The student must also inscribe his/her name on the application form exactly as it is desired to appear on the diploma and graduation program. Preparation for Graduation - Students must also prepare for graduation at the beginning of the final semester, within the guidelines established by the SGS. It is the student's responsibility to ensure that all requirements have been met and that every deadline is observed. The SGS, college, school, or graduate degree program sets forth all deadline dates in the University Calendar. Students should obtain copies of Thesis/Capstone/Final Project Guidelines from the SGS and/or their graduate degree program office and review them carefully prior to putting the thesis, capstone or final project into its final form. The following is a summary of critical items required for graduation: Candidates must complete and file an \"Application for Graduation\" with the Registrar during the semester in which graduation is anticipated, within the deadline established by the University. The Candidate's graduation application form must be signed by the advisor and director of the graduate program and accompanied by a completed and approved Plan of Study (and related forms). Candidate must inscribe his or her name on the application form as he or she wishes it to appear on the diploma and in the commencement program. Candidates whose applications are approved must officially \"checkout\" of the University, i.e., satisfy all financial responsibilities and obtain clearance from the appropriate offices/divisions on campus. Candidates must pay a non-refundable graduation fee. Commencement - Master's degree candidates who are eligible for graduation are required to be registered in the University during the semester they are to receive their degrees. Candidates who are eligible to receive graduate degrees are required to participate in commencement in order to personally accept the honor indicated by the appropriate hood. Students must arrange to acquire the proper academic attire to be worn at commencement. Candidates who cannot participate in commencement must obtain an official excuse from the Dean of the SGS. The request to graduate in absentia must be based on verifiable legitimate reasons and must be submitted in writing prior to commencement and approved by the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs. Candidates whose degree applications have been officially filed and approved, must officially \"check- out\" of the University, i.e., satisfy all financial responsibilities and obtain clearance from all appropriate offices on campus (even if excused from attendance at commencement). This clearance is supported by obtaining the authorized signatures in the following order: SCHOOL OF GRADUATE STUDIES 322 Department Chair (Program Director) College Dean Graduate Assessment Office Financial Aid Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Comptroller Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs A mailing fee is assessed for mailing the diploma after the commencement to students who are permitted not to participate in commencement. If a candidate pays the commencement fee but fails to graduate, he/she must re-apply for graduation during a subsequent semester. MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS (MGIS) 323 MASTER OF SCIENCE IN MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS Adnan Omar, Ph.D., Chair Office: 110 - College of Business and Public Administration Building Phone: (504) 286-5142 Email: aomar@suno.edu Professors : David G. Ph.D., and Yanjun Yu, Ph.D. The purpose of the Masters of Science Program in the Management Information Systems (MS-MGIS) is to integrate information technology and business management. The program is designed to provide students with a strong educational foundation thereby preparing them as Information System (IS) professionals. MS-MGIS consists of a specially designed curriculum, which emphasizes conceptual, analytical, technical, and interpersonal skills. It blends theory and practice into a learning experience that develops skills applicable to complex real-world problems. It is designed to give students a thorough knowledge of the field and to provide an enduring foundation for future professional growth. To be successful in the increasingly competitive global marketplace, most corporations are looking for employees that have comprehensive knowledge and training in both business management and information technology. MS-MGIS delivers exactly that. The MGIS Department, which is housed in the College of Business at Southern University at New Orleans (SUNO), has a mission that mirrors the aspirations of the business community. The MS-MGIS curriculum is designed to accommodate both individuals holding undergraduate management related degrees and other professionals who may have non-management related baccalaureate degrees. LEARNING GOALS & OBJECTIVES 1. Student is able to make an ethical decision in a business setting. Student is able to identify ethical principles Student is able to evaluate the situation and justify his or her decisions. 2. Student is able to apply effective communication skills in a professional environment. Student is able to prepare and deliver an effective presentation. Student is able to produce well written documents. 3. Student is able to understand the role of technology and the process for managing information systems in organizations. Student is able to apply methodologies to design an information system. Student is able to understand project management skills in support of organization needs. All students admitted into the program are assigned to a primary graduate program advisor. The graduate program advisor provides counseling about needed prerequisite courses, foundation courses, and core course scheduling. Students also have access to other faculty members as secondary advisors. All students with non-business related degrees are required to complete a minimum of five undergraduate business foundation courses. Prerequisites and foundation courses can be completed at SUNO or elsewhere. In order to accommodate part-time as well as full-time students, classes are held in the evening, MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS (MGIS) 324 weekends, and on-line. The MS-MGIS Program is a commuter friendly program because all classes meet only once a week. Specific Requirements Applicants must submit either the GRE or the GMAT test scores for evaluation. Students interested in pursuing post-graduate study as well as those who have a high probability of job transfers are strongly encouraged to take the GMAT as a majority of the MS-MGIS degrees in the United States require the GMAT score. For admission into the MS-MGIS Program, all applicants must provide the following: an acceptable GRE score (in some cases, a high GRE may be used to compensate for a low GPA) or an acceptable GMAT score. Students in the MS-MGIS will be expected to complete 36 hours of MGIS course work for graduation. Foundation courses are for students who do not have at least 15 credit hours of business courses in their earned undergraduate or graduate degrees. All students must take MGIS 505-Writing for Research in Management Information Systems. All classes in the MS-MGIS Program require students to have a basic understanding of business processes. For example, students enrolled in the Systems Analysis course are expected to have some knowledge of a payroll system when they are asked to perform an analysis and design an updated system. Similarly, students enrolled in the Database Management course are expected to have some knowledge of supply chain systems when they are asked to develop the logical as well as physical schema to capture the needed data. All MS-MGIS students should therefore have a working knowledge of the materials contained in the following set of business courses required for undergraduate MGIS majors: Foundation Courses Principles of Financial Accounting Principles of Management Principles of Finance Legal Environment of Business Principles of Marketing Students are recommended to first complete the foundation courses before taking core courses.

THE PROFESSION OF SOCIAL WORK The profession of social work is concerned with enhancing social functioning and improving the human condition through the promotion of social and institutional change and the provision of opportunities and resources to individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities. The fundamental concern of social work is the relationship between individuals and social institutions. Of central importance is the development of these relationships in such a way as to promote social and economic justice and protect the opportunities for people to live with dignity and freedom. Professional practice focuses on the transactions between people and their environments that affect their ability to accomplish life tasks. EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY AND THEMES The Southern University School of Social Work is committed to a view of social work that is holistic and transcending in its approach. Emphasis is placed on the strengths and growth potentials of people, individually and collectively. The BSW and MSW curricula focus on generalist and advanced social work practice, respectively which are concerned with enhancing and improving the human condition through the promotion of social and institutional change and the provision of opportunities and resources to individuals, families, groups, organizations and communities. The themes of ADVOCACY, EMPOWERMENT, AND TRANSFORMATION provide a pivotal and integrating link between the educational objectives of the program and the curriculum content. These themes embrace a view of the individual, family, group, organization, or community, as responsible actors in the self-actualization and change processes. SCHOOL OF SOCIAL WORK 346 Advocacy Refers to the act of providing support to and intervention in the interest of client systems. These efforts are directed toward the realignment of power to effect change and achieve freedom from oppression. Empowerment Focuses attention on the fact that powerlessness is pervasive and pre-eminent among oppressed people. As a profession which impacts the lives of these people, we are committed to teaching strategies which incorporate the concept of empowering individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities to take control of their own lives, and shape their destinies. Transformation To accomplish transformation, the profession of social work must assist individuals, families, groups, organizations and communities to change the structure of systems that exert a confining and oppressive hold on their opportunities for achievement. Organization and Structure of the School of Social Work The SUNO School of Social Work administers two programs: (1) a baccalaureate program (BSW) which provides social work education in preparation for beginning generalist professional practice; and (2) a graduate course of study (MSW) which provides social work education in preparation for advanced specialized professional practice. Accreditation and Program Approval The SUNO Master of Social Work program is accredited by the Council on Social Work Education and the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. The MSW program has been continuously accredited since 1985. The program's accreditation was reaffirmed 2012 for 8 years, until 2020. THE MASTER OF SOCIAL WORK PROGRAM Program Objectives The MSW program at Southern University at New Orleans has the following objectives: 1.

SCHOOL OF SOCIAL WORK 347 3. To provide students with knowledge and understanding of general systems theory and an ecological theoretical perspective as an integrating framework, and its application, with emphasis on strengths and ecological social work practice at both micro, mezzo, and macro levels. 4.
