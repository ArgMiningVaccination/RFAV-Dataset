And like Yoga, the ancient Chinese marital art has a laundry list of health benefits including strengthening your immune system, boosting energy levels, lowering blood pressure and cholesterol, and reducing anxiety. We asked [Matthew Cohen](http://acacialifestyle.com/), star of Tai Chi and Qi Gong Basics to share more about Tai Chi's \"healing powers\". Tai Chi heals the whole body from the inside out, due in large part to its positive effect on the meridian system. Traditional Chinese medicine believes we have energy pathways in the body called meridians; these meridians or energy pathways relate to all of the organ systems in the body. If these pathways become stagnated, or compromised, our health can also be affected. One of Tai Chi Chuan's great effects is to balance the body's energy by clearing blockages in these pathways. Tai Chi Chuan reduces stress by activating the body's natural parasympathetic nervous system through long, calm, deep, natural breathing. Tai Chi also teaches the student how to cultivate, store, regulate and manage one's life energy. Tai Chi is a powerful blend of mind and muscle exercise. Ease into your week with this moving meditation from [Tai Chi and Qi Gong Basics](http://acacialifestyle.com/). Target: Cloud hands as a health practice is a great way to cultivate power and energy while strengthening the legs, back and waist. It balances Yin and Yang energies in the body and develops coordination, sensitivity and awareness in the arms and hands. As a meditation in motion, it is very relaxing and calming, yet still, very invigorating. How To Do It: Stand wider than hips distance apart with feet parallel and grounded. Begin with one hand resting on the lower abdomen as the other arm reaches down, circling up the front of the body, across the horizon line (extending out from the center of the chest), and down again in an inward circle toward the body, as if raising a toast to someone. Switch arms, and follow the movement, shifting body weight gracefully from one foot to the other. Integrate the movement with a soft spine, gaze on the horizon, and both arms should be expressive and fluid. As one arm traces up the center line of the body and across, the other moves down, then up in an inward circle toward the body, trailing slowly behind. Let the movement be fluid and cyclical. To finish, slowly raise both hands up the center line of the body with bent elbows, gathering energy, and release the hands down by the hips. "}
