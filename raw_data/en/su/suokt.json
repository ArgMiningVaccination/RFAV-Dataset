Weighing in at about 3 pounds, your liver is one of your largest organs, and it is also one your most important, as it responsible for a long list of critical jobs. For example, your liver eventually processes everything you eat. In addition to storing and releasing energy from foods, your liver also acts as your body's natural filter, removing toxins, wastes and other \"gunk\" from your blood. Your liver then cleans up (i.e., detoxifies) these substances and helps facilitate their removal (in your stool and urine, for example). When you consider that 1 in 4 people has metabolic associated fatty liver (formerly known as non-alcoholic fatty liver) combined with an ever-present and growing toxic load - from the food we eat (e.g., preservatives, pesticides, heavy metals, etc.), air we breathe (e.g., environmental toxins), liquids we drink (e.g., alcohol, chemicals, artificial sweeteners, etc.), medications we take and so on - it should be crystal clear that we need to be doing everything we possibly can to support the health and function of this vital organ to help keep the body's filter clean and running smoothly. And that's exactly why we formulated VITAL LIVER: proactive daily support for healthy liver function and detoxification. Who would benefit best from using this product? VITAL LIVER is expertly formulated with a unique blend of ingredients that have long history of use and have been clinically validated to help benefit: - Anyone looking to help detox the liver and help keeping the body's filter clean - Individuals concerned about maintaining healthy liver enzyme activity and healthy liver function - Anyone looking to help maintain a healthy Fatty Liver Index (FLI)* - Men and women seeking proactive daily liver support - Young men and women who occasionally drink alcohol and want to be proactive about protecting their liver health and function - Individuals who occasionally consume alcohol and are seeking nutritional support that promotes detoxification and proper alcohol metabolism - Those seeking support for healthy digestion and bowel regularity *FLI is calculated using body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and levels of gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and triglycerides in the serum. FLI can estimate fatty liver severity and liver fat accumulation with high accuracy, and it is considered a simple, reliable and non-invasive method to monitor the progression of fatty liver. #This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any diseases, including fatty liver disease.
