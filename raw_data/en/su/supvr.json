Smith University CHARLOTTE, N.C., March 10, 2021 - As another successful mass vaccination event continues at Bank of America Stadium, in Uptown Charlotte, this week, Atrium Health is partnering with Johnson C. Smith University (JCSU), the State of North Carolina and Mecklenburg County to host a mass vaccination event on the JCSU campus this weekend with a goal of vaccinating thousands of local teachers. Vaccinations will be administered, by appointment only, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturday, March 13, and Sunday, March 14, in the Jack S. Brayboy Gymnasium. \"Getting the COVID-19 vaccine is an educated decision,\" said Dr. Gary Little, chief medical officer for the Charlotte Region at Atrium Health. \"What better place to provide this opportunity for teachers than an outstanding institution of higher learning like Johnson C. Smith University. With more than a dozen schools within a 3-mile radius of the campus, it's an ideal location for us to reach teachers and early childhood workers. As we think about a 'return to normal' in our society, having kids back in school is one of the most essential elements of that and we are proud to be able to help teachers protect their health by making the COVID-19 vaccine available at this event. It can be their 'spring break' from many of the worries they may have about the virus.\" \"Educators have a very important role in our society,\" said Clarence D. Armbrister, J.D., president of Johnson C. Smith University. \"They have had to adapt to the ever-changing conditions and expectations brought on by the pandemic as they have worked tirelessly to deliver knowledge to the next generation. We can help alleviate some of their concerns about their safety and the safety of their students when they receive their vaccinations on campus this weekend.\" Atrium Health plans to administer 6,000 doses of the vaccine at this weekend's event. All appointments have been filled. Atrium Health has worked in concert with the State of North Carolina and Mecklenburg County throughout its vaccination efforts. The county made a specific request to the state to help support this event and others taking place in the community supporting the vaccination of teachers and early childhood workers. With the recent expansion of eligibility to receive vaccination, JCSU faculty and staff are among those newly eligible to be vaccinated. Current state eligibility guidance includes anyone over the age of 65 and essential, frontline workers in industries such as education, public safety, transportation and health care, among others. While the mass vaccination event is focused on teachers, any eligible person may sign up for available appointments. Vaccination efforts are just one of the COVID-19 mitigation efforts taking place between Atrium Health and JCSU. As part of an ongoing partnership, Atrium Health is helping the university implement COVID-Safe standards for its workforce and student body. This includes health screening protocols, testing of students upon their return to campus, working with the JCSU athletic department to ensure compliance for student-athletes to be able to compete, and exposure management, in the event of a positive COVID-19 case among faculty, staff or students.
