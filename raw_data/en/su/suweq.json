At the center of the story are chiropractic's colorful founders, D. D. Palmer and his son, B. J. Palmer, of Davenport, Iowa, where in 1897 they established the Palmer College of Chiropractic. Holly Folk shows how the Palmers' system depicted chiropractic as a conduit for both material and spiritualized versions of a \"vital principle,\" reflecting popular contemporary therapies and nineteenth-century metaphysical beliefs, including the idea that the spine was home to occult forces. The creation of chiropractic, and other Progressive-era versions of alternative medicine, happened at a time when the relationship between science and religion took on an urgent, increasingly competitive tinge. Many remarkable people, including the Palmers, undertook highly personal reinterpretations of their physical and spiritual worlds. In this context, Folk reframes alternative medicine and spirituality as a type of populist intellectual culture in which ideologies about the body comprise a highly appealing form of cultural resistance.

I owe a special debt to Joseph C. Keating Jr., who was an exceptional mentor for me and many other researchers in chiropractic history. Songs of praise are due to my reviewers, Timothy Miller and Pamela Klassen, whose rigorous engagement with my work expanded the dimensions in which I thought about the project. They made many helpful suggestions, yet also offered the needed encouragement for me to take the inquiry in the directions I felt it needed to go. I am a much better scholar thanks to them. I want to thank my editor at UNC Press, Elaine Maisner, for seeing potential in this project and nurturing its development. She tempered my argument in places warranted, but tolerated its irreverent, vernacular style. Elaine was a guiding presence over a long writing process. The book was brought to what felt like a swift completion with the assistance of a large production team. I appreciate all the steps, large and small, taken by members of UNC Press who helped with this project, especially Becki Reibman, Jay Mazzocchi, and Dino Battista. I did much of the research for this book at the Davenport, Iowa, campus of Palmer Chiropractic University. I appreciate the hospitality of everyone at the school, especially Victor Strang, Fred Barge, and Alana Calendar. A heartfelt note of thanks to Glenda Wiese, Dennis Peterson, and Rosemary Riess\u2014all in Special Collections at the David D. Palmer Health Sciences Library. At Western Washington University, thanks are owed to the Liberal Studies Department, the College of Humanities and Social Sciences, and Western Libraries. xi The insights and support of many colleagues have been vital forces for this book. My thinking about new religious movements has been greatly improved by conversations with Susan Palmer, George Chryssides, Eileen Barker, Larry Foster, Ben Zeller, and Catherine Wessinger. Members of the NRM listserv generously shared ideas and pdf files of hard-to-find sources. I owe my understanding of Western Esotericism to the collective wisdom of Brad Whitsel, Jocelyn Godwin, Jean-Francois Meyer, Jeff Kripal, and Joe Nickel, and especially to the tutelage of Gordon Melton and Massimo Introvigne. Let me state my enduring gratitude to the scholars who so strongly influenced my understanding of American cultural history: Randall Balmer, Richard Bushman, Robert Orsi, Mary Jo Weaver, Wendy Gamber, Paul G utjahr, and the incomparable Steven Stein. Michael and Deborah Goldberg introduced me to the social-scientific study of American medicine years ago. Much of what I know about both ACAM and modern neuroscience can be traced back to conversations at their dinner table. Through my travails as a road cyclist, I have met healthcare providers from many fields. Special appreciation goes out to Erich Weidenbener, MD; Harvey Schwartz, DC; Joseph Wessels, ND; and Matthew Oswin, DO. I am glad for their honest assessments of the social terrain of their professions and for encouraging me to persevere in understanding them. Thanks to the friends who have reached out through space and time: Donna Meigs Jaques, Tom Lappas, Maria Manzola, Cuong Mai, Jeanne Smith, Sylvia Van Bruggen, Douglas Padgett, Sonja Spear, Glenn Zuber, Becca Harlin, Branko Curgus, David Hartenstine, Gardiner, Dean Christiansen, George Dyson, Zoe Alderton, Peter Reinke, Guy Darst, Laura Kohl, Jessica Anderson, and Johann Neem. Peter Scott gets a line of his own, for being Totally Shimano. I want to acknowledge Steven S. Power for his help with these acknowledgments. And thanks to my colleague Rob Stoops, who read drafts of the manuscript with the forbearance of Jehovah. This project consumed much of my attention for some time, and I am glad for the love of my family to see me through it: Carolyn and Melvin Schwartz, David Folk, and Emma Tyukody. Gratitude, especially, to my daughters, Canaan and Anik\u00f3, for their faith and long-sufferingness, and for endowing my life with purpose. This book is dedicated to my grandparents, whose commitment to the future helped me reach this season. xii a c k n o w l e d g m e n t s the religion of chiropractic This page intentionally left blank introduction To force people to choose a doctor they do not want is to interfere with their liberty and individual rights. When human liberty is restricted for any pretext whatever, there is danger and trouble ahead. It brings the majesty of law into disrepute, demoralizes the community in which unjust laws are enforced, and incites a rebellious spirit. \u2014D. D. Palmer The intent of this book is to treat chiropractic as a case study to explore a persistent overlap of beliefs and practices found in many American subcultures. It is neither possible or desirable to adjudicate the scientific status of something as heterogeneous as alternative medicine; regular and alternative medicine are not scientific descriptors, but socially defined categories with differing criteria for authoritative knowledge but much other content in common. \"Regular\" and \"alternative\" capture cultural attitudes toward health beliefs and practices. I hope to persuade readers of the importance of reconstructing the lineage for ideas often rendered \"eternal\" or \"perennial\" by participants in the Metaphysical movement\u2014new religions that emerged in nineteenth-century America and Europe and shared a Neoplatonic idealist orientation. (In this text, the Metaphysical traditions are distinguished from the philosophical branch of metaphysics by their different capitalization.) Today, Holism is popular around the world, and wherever literacy, technology, and global culture have spread, Western types of alternative medicine appear to have growing appeal. Alternative medicine and spirituality have rich intellectual histories behind them, though the language applied to these movements has changed over time. Thus my goals are both to relate the chiropractic narrative and put it into historical context. I will document the progression of a set of ideas through many health systems. In this way, I hope to offer an interpretive framework for alternative medicine and spirituality. 1 Chiropractic is among the best examples of a convergence of two outlooks that give consistency to alternative medicine. I carry the twin themes of \"vitalism\" and \"populism\" through this book, and I believe a great deal of alternative medicine can be apprehended through them. That vitalist ideas connect alternative religion and alternative medicine is evidenced in the ubiquitous phrase, \"Body, Mind and Spirit.\" Vitalist ideas are protean, adaptive to science, spirituality, and different theoretical nuances. This is one of the reasons they are so enduring. Often vitalist ideas are deliberately not interrogated, but rather reified and presented as \"the way things are.\" This is not accidental. Vitalism legitimates heterogeneous beliefs and practices and justifies treatments in the minds of both patrons and practitioners. The persistence of these ideas into the modern age points to an enduring uncertainty about how to demarcate the natural from the supernatural, and the sacred from the profane. Historians have shown the flow of a charged populist sentiment into many cultural ventures in the decades after the American Revolution.1 Interpretations of \"Jacksonian culture\" are not unified: both scholars and the public disagree about the meaning, significance, and implications of ideologized \"democracy.\"2 I hope my work opens up alternative medicine to a similarly broad interpretive treatment. I understand populism primarily as a cultural orientation, based on the view that the power of elites must be contained in all realms for egalitarian democracy to work. The chiropractic movement did not seek alignment with political or agrarian populists, but it traded on sentiments that had been nurtured in American health subcultures for a long time. Populists are often portrayed as anti- intellectual, but they are just as often counter-intellectual\u2014pursuing alternatives to mainstream knowledge, which they see as tainted by plutocrats and aristocrats.3 Chiropractic resonated not only with beliefs and practices that were widespread in the culture of its origin, but with the social attitudes that upheld them. It is notable that endeavors like chiropractic emerged at the precise historical moment when the relationship between science and religion was fracturing, at least in the perceptions of many people. The embrace of \"nature\" as a healing agent can be seen as a rejection of modernity and industrialization. Even more important was the cultivation of an antiauthoritarianism that I believe is characteristic of alternative medicine then and now. Early irregular medicine invoked the cultural idea of democratic individualism that was constructed in the Early Republic and Jacksonian Era, aligning patriotism with \"health liberty.\" Like its predecessors, the chiropractic 2 i n t r o d u c t i o n movement consistently makes appeals to individualism, egalitarianism, and self-determination in health issues. My work brings me to consider chiropractic theory as a type of radically independent lay scientific discourse. In the nineteenth century, writing and self-publishing became a means of resistance and self-expression. One can find no better exponents of this tendency than Daniel David (D. D.) Palmer and his son, Joshua Bartlett (B. J. Palmer), respectively the \"discoverer\" and \"developer\" of chiropractic, whose life histories are the backbone of this book. The Palmers' careers illustrate how writing and publishing offered ways for individuals to assert themselves in a society that was rapidly becoming more industrial, bureaucratic, hierarchical, and anonymous. In the early twentieth century (and into the present), chiropractic offered a way to \"be\" existentially, and to be knowledgeable and scientific in a competitive cultural environment, at a time when science was rapidly becoming something nonprofessionals could not understand or engage. It is no accident that so many chiropractors self-published refinements of chiropractic theory, ran experiments, and made discoveries. In the Progressive Era, supernaturalism was rejected in favor of science, but some people appropriated scientific frameworks to support their understandings of the supernatural. This complicates the perceived divide between science and religion. I hope my work opens discussions about some of the conceptual boundaries used in American religious history, helping fill the call issued by Courtney Bender to collapse the \"binary distinctions between popular and official, public and private, institutional and individual religion to closer analysis of the interactions between them.\"4 Chiropractic was one of many systems designed to heal by handling the vertebral column and thereby regulating the \"life force\" residing in the central nervous system. I use the phrase \"vertebral vitalism\" to describe this popular physiology. Vertebral vitalism was a tapestry of ideas, some centuries old, from domains across Western science, religion, and philosophy. It brought together the array of ideas informing medical and Metaphysical vitalism, and incorporated advances in the field of neurology. In Europe it emerged as an articulated theory in the eighteenth century. Prominent figures like Hermann Boerhaave, Albrecht von Haller, and Robert Whytt came to endorse its premises. While vertebral vitalism was first advanced by these medical elites, in America and the British Isles the paradigm trickled down to both medical reformers and lay people. By the late eighteenth century, discussions of the nervous system began to appear in magazines and the \"compendiums of useful knowledge\" that were one of the most widely purchased i n t r o d u c t i o n 3 types of books. It was in such popular literature, oriented to a general readership, that the vertebral vitalist paradigm grew to full fruition by the middle of the nineteenth century, and where it came to encompass an admixture of medical theory from several periods, folk healing practices, and both older and recent religious ideas. While its lead practices were therapeutic touch and other treatments directly applied to the back, vertebral vitalism also was invoked to explain and justify a range of healing practices including conventional medicine, diet reform, water cure, and some types of spiritual healing. It was subscribed to by large numbers of lay people, some regular doctors, and most \"medical sectarians.\" The sheer pervasiveness of these ideas should have ramifications for one's understanding of science, religion, medicine, and healing in Progressive Era America. What most Americans understand about chiropractic is mediated through their experiences with chiropractic care. When they begin visiting a chiropractor, people usually do not think of chiropractic as a treatment offering potential benefits for general health beyond back pain. They might be surprised to know chiropractors see it as useful this way and to learn how this perspective is supported through prevalent chiropractic theory, which is only partially revealed in initial office visits. Today, chiropractic is widely understood to be a theory of therapeutic spinal manipulation, most often recommended for lower back pain. Yet its creator envisioned chiropractic as more than musculoskeletal physical therapy. D. D. Palmer reinterpreted vitalist and metaphysical principles circulating in popular American health culture. He identified \"Innate Intelligence\" as the main determinant of health. \"Innate\" was one of three \"Intelligences\" or \"Forces\" in Palmer's second chiropractic system; by this he meant the spirit or personal manifestation of the cosmic power of \"Universal Intelligence.\" The third force D. D. called \"Educated Intelligence.\" This term is best understood as the conscious individual mind, an entity that held great power in many Metaphysical systems, though less in chiropractic. The interplay of these forces was responsible for all the workings of life, in that every living creature was a manifestation of an immanent divine force; human beings and the divine were therefore consubstantial. More than a theory of \"pinched nerves,\" Palmer's understanding of chiropractic indicated a deep engagement with the religious questions of the day. It posited a divine (though not anthropomorphic) Mind, and established a relationship between Consciousness or Spirit and Matter. Just as he viewed chiropractic as an improvement over magnetic healing, D. D. claimed his practice was superior to other Metaphysical traditions. For example, 4 i n t r o d u c t i o n Christian Science denied Matter and privileged Spirit; Mental Healing proclaimed Mind over Matter; but in chiropractic, Spirit worked through Matter. Only chiropractic, therefore, properly understood the cosmic laws that governed health. In this way, chiropractic was to be a comprehensive theory of health and illness. Palmer proffered his new system as effective for cancer, diphtheria, and childbed fever. He believed it would supersede orthodox medicine's germ theory of disease. Many scholars have chronicled the affinities between alternative spirituality and alternative medicine. Sydney E. Ahlstrom posited a set of related movements he called the \"Harmonial tradition,\" that have been especially important for scholarship on health and healing.5 Ahlstrom described Harmonialism as an impulse that transcended most conventional boundaries of religious affiliation, giving rise to a family of subtraditions unified by a sense of integration between the individual believer and the cosmos. Harmonialists shared an interest in spiritual composure, physical health, and, sometimes, financial well-being. Ahlstrom inspired other scholars to discuss alternative medicine and spirituality as manifestations of a common impulse, alternately referred to as Harmonial or Metaphysical traditions.6 Spiritualism, Mind Cure, New Thought, and Christian Science are prominent movements, with substantial followings even today. Yet these well-known traditions represent only a fraction of Americans' engagement with this distinct religious outlook. Most Metaphysical bodies were ephemeral and small, and only a few built large, lasting institutions. Yet the aggregate number of groups has been almost too high to count, leading religion scholar Catherine L. Albanese to argue persuasively that Metaphysical spirituality is a \"third stream\" in American religious life, one that rivals Liturgical Christianity or Evangelical Protestantism. Chiropractic both reflects and problematizes what is known about the Metaphysical movement. Its theories relate the material world to higher spiritual realities. Historically, the profession has been male in both fact and vision, so that feminized representations of healing have been downplayed. And the organizational models chiropractic has pursued\u2014as a profession and an organized commercial enterprise\u2014set the system at an odd angle to many forms of religion and spirituality, even while Chiropractic Philosophy carries nearly all of J. Stillson Judah's \"Metaphysical markers.\"7 Both scientific and spiritual, chiropractic is a pragmatic, applied philosophy that understands the divine as an impersonal force that is indwelling in human beings and connected to their physical and psychic well-being. Chiropractic healing philosophies exist along a spectrum of spiritual emphasis, but the more i n t r o d u c t i o n 5 intense manifestations are not averse to coopting doctrines from established religions, such as Buddhism and Christianity. Some key historians have influenced my understanding of the interweaving of healing, business success, and spiritual happiness in the American Metaphysical movement. Kathryn Lofton has described the New Thought Movement as a \"combinatory trope\" whose philosophical idealism first justifies spiritual healing, and then prosperity. Lofton distills these observations into an aphorism worthy of the best New Thought thinker: \"Coming into consciousness with God produces health; likewise, coming into consciousness with God produces abundance.\"8 Nonetheless, the promise of business success is usually treated humorously in popular culture\u2014one can think of motivational speaker Tony Robbins, who even parodied himself in the comedy film Shallow Hal. The elective affinity provokes anxieties about religion and profit that scholars of religion also can have difficulty bracketing. A prominent exception, though, is Donald Meyer, who put the emergence of the Metaphysical movement into historical context in The Positive Thinkers. Meyer argues that the individualism and self-confidence stressed in Metaphysical philosophies were strategies to maintain a sense of human meaning in a depersonalizing, bureaucratic, post-industrial society. I am very influenced by his interpretation of success-oriented business culture. This book describes the evolution of the chiropractic profession alongside the biographies of three generations of the Palmer family. The Palmers were not the only chiropractic dynasty. Like many new religious movements, kinship maintained the chiropractic movement and supports the subculture today.9 Family practices are handed down from father to son, and slightly less frequently to daughters, and the descendants of founders lead or remain closely connected to many chiropractic schools. But the tempestuousness of the Palmer family history set the tone for the chiropractic profession for many decades. And their notorious interpersonal hostilities are useful in understanding how such conflicts affect social movements prone to schism. Two relevant examples are Christian Science and Theosophy, which both weathered bitter fallings-out between founders and key disciples. I believe such fractures are not accidents, but proceed from the personalities of the movements' founders, whose extreme individualism was, in many cases, the cause of both their success their undoing. Metaphysical ideologies seem to attract people not given to excel at following orders or doing the kind of cooperative work that is necessary to form large and lasting institutions.10 I believe this bent toward individualism is responsible for the pattern of growth and dissemination we see in alternative spirituality more broadly: instead of being 6 i n t r o d u c t i o n vertical and directed toward Weberian rationalization, the spread is horizontal and toward fragmentation or better yet\u2014fractalization. The Palmers' biographies and the growth of the chiropractic profession illustrate this tendency magnificently. Due to its subaltern positioning, chiropractic was until quite recently ignored by historians of medicine. Thus chiropractic history has been told largely by chiropractors. This has at least two implications, both historiographic and interpretive. A good deal of chiropractic history is partisan and even hagiographic, but it is also worth noting that within the chiropractic world, writing history stands as a \"discursive practice\" through which chiropractors deepen their connections to their vocation. For \"Straight\" chiropractors who have acutely religious understandings of the practice, writing is an act through which the Divine becomes real.11 A number of historians have argued forcefully for the importance of print cultures in the making of American religious life.12 Books, newspapers, correspondence, and self-published manifestos have been especially important for liberal and alternative spiritualities, whose adherents were dispersed across the land. For groups that did not enjoy the advantages of large numbers of believers in close geographic proximity, print culture created a sense of identity through textual communities. This book is not meant to be an institutional history, which is much better told by the historian Johnny Stuart Moore and the sociologist Walter Wardwell.13 Nor is it meant to be a detailed biography of the Palmers, for I cannot augment the studies by Vern Gielow and Joseph F. Keating, biographers of D. D. and B. J. Palmer, respectively.14 My work engages most directly with that of Catherine L. Albanese and Candy Gunther Brown, who each have written on chiropractic from the perspectives of religion and cultural history.15 I build on their studies, but differ in focus and interpretation in my emphasis on the topics of vitalism and popular intellectual culture. I intend to show that it was less the uniqueness of D. D. Palmer's \"discovery\" than the strategic placement of his practice in a remarkable cultural milieu that accounts for much of the early success of the profession. I understand alternative medical theories as a form of cultural resistance to a rapidly centralizing medical establishment.16 A number of historians of science have explored the use of \"knowledge alternatives\" as vehicles for social engagement, cohesion, and even protest.17 This inquiry is separate from questions about the effectiveness of alternative and complimentary therapies. While the effectiveness of different treatments has varied widely, their cultural orientation has been remarkably consistent. Dissent has been a dominant feature of alternative medicine for the past 200 years. i n t r o d u c t i o n 7 I use perspectives from the field of religious studies, which allows me to bracket truth claims about vitalism in favor of cultural interpretation. In explaining my work to people, I have found it necessary, and also very challenging, to communicate my view that many of the ideas carried in alternative medicine are theological in nature. But philosophies that reify the life principle into an intentional, conscious presence in the body de facto shift the terrain of inquiry from science to religion. Ironically, even while I try to show the conceptual \"alchemy\" of that shift in my scholarship, I follow many of the lifestyle habits associated with alternative health movements. This book is greatly informed by two specific theoretical perspectives from religious studies. The chiropractic story shows how \"religious work\" is done in practical, mundane experiences as well as formal ritual settings. This is especially important today, in an era of declining church attendance, religious disaffiliation, and an increase in people's self-identification as \"unaffiliated\" or \"nones.\" I follow the lead of scholars of \"lived religion\" who have rightfully directed us to refocus our attention toward religious life in the \"everyday.\" A lived religion approach recognizes both beliefs and practices as important, and sees authorities and lay people as engaged in shared and equally valid projects of creating religious meaning.18 Robert Orsi and Karen Brown argue persuasively that \"healing,\" defined expansively as physical, psychic or social reconciliation, is the central activity of religion. The focus on laity, the spiritual content of daily life, and the importance of healing bring chiropractic into the religious fold. Above all, lived religion understands religious actors making choices and connections among the content they encounter. Wendy Doniger makes this point well in describing religious settings as \"pointillist,\" like the separate dots that form the shape of a modernist painting.19 Lived religion recognizes the intense subjectivity that drives doctrinal differences. This is a helpful insight when thinking about the fissiparousness of the chiropractic movement. Whereas approaches from religious studies can illuminate the chiropractic movement, chiropractic has the potential to advance scholarly understandings of religion and healing. The social repair of relationships, resolution of spiritual distress, connection with the transcendent, or helping the individual endure suffering\u2014these are foci in the scholarship of religion and healing that track well with the goals of Western holism.20 Healing is certainly the focus of chiropractic, and individual chiropractors deliver balms for the psyche, especially for long-term patients who regard them as confidants. But the treatment often is quite physically forceful; some patients find it painful. As people, chiropractors may not lack empathy, 8 i n t r o d u c t i o n yet the healthy-minded orientation and individualist economic values cultivated by the profession pull it away from the liberal healing ethos. Most important, the chiropractic subculture has cultivated an interpersonal assertiveness that can discomfit those who have experienced it. Despite being a touch-based therapy, there is much in chiropractic that is not \"touchy-feely.\" The second insight from religious studies comes from church historian Ernst Troeltsch, himself an observer of the changes I document here. Troeltsch observed that the nineteenth-century print revolution had so greatly expanded the available options for knowledge that it changed the basis for epistemology, making it normal for individuals to determine truth for themselves. Troeltsch thought the refashioning of truth in radically individualist terms united an array of intellectual and philosophical developments. He saw it specifically behind the Metaphysical spiritualities kindred to chiropractic. Troeltsch viewed spiritual religion negatively, because of its potential to undermine collective religious life. As Courtney Bender points out, this perception lingers in scholars' criticism of alternative spirituality for failing to build lasting institutions.21 Bender recommends looking for religion and spirituality in places that are not usually thought of as religious, which she sees as critical in a \"secular\" age.22 Chiropractic does build institutions, but on a platform distinct from congregational religious ventures. Structured as a profession, chiropractic argues for an expansion of the types of categories through which religion can be mediated, and in which growth or success can be detected. The chiropractic story should alert us to how spirituality penetrates into the everyday. Late in life, D. D. Palmer wrote an essay that was published posthumously, \"The Moral and Religious Duty of a Chiropractor.\"23 D. D. did not want to incorporate chiropractic as a religion; rather, he felt chiropractors should be able to use the religious conscience clauses in the medical laws of many states. \"I do not propose to change chiropractic, either in its science, art or philosophy, into a religion. . . . There is a vast difference between a theological religion and a religious duty; between the precepts and practices of religion and that of chiropractic. A person may be a conscientious devotee of any theological creed and yet be a strict, upright, exalted principled practitioner of chiropractic. . . . Chiro Religio, Chiropractic Religion, the Religion of Chiropractic and the Religious Duty of a Chiropractor are one and the same.\"24 Chiropractic Philosophy was intended as a \"parallel system\" to the confessional commitments felt by individual chiropractors. At the same time, \"Chiropractic Religion\" was something D. D. invested with great meaning. Not i n t r o d u c t i o n 9 only were chiropractors bound by sacred obligations to care for their patients, it is clear from the essay that D. D. saw chiropractic theory conforming to a metaphysical system in which the world operated scientifically but was fueled by divine power. Then and now, chiropractic's overtly religious dimension was disavowed by much of the profession, but the spiritual impulse behind D. D.'s exhortation has proved quite resilient. Insofar as it tries to reconstruct the intellectual history of a fractious movement, this book seeks narrative clarity and follows the most important veins, while admitting some issues will receive less attention. Little consideration is paid to the spirituality of chiropractic patients, for though some share chiropractors' interest in Metaphysics, Chiropractic Philosophy is much more important to practitioners. My treatment of gender focuses on the men who formed the ranks of the chiropractic movement. The creation of the chiropractic system, its establishment as a profession, and internal struggles for authority in the chiropractic movement were negotiated in almost entirely male arenas, with women conspicuously absent from ideological battles. The archetypes championed by the profession include the \"small businessman,\" the \"great man of scientific discovery,\" and the \"populist patriot\" fighting for intellectual and therapeutic equality. One might wonder whether any of these transpose well enough to women to value their equal participation, and speculate about whether this is intentional. In the pages of Chiropractic History and the publications of many chiropractic colleges and professional associations, there is substantial evidence that while gender expectations were those of small-town, white, Protestant America, women were not held in disrespect. But this does not get around the fact that into the 1990s women were a distinct minority among chiropractors. The realities of chiropractic history also reveal uneasy truths about the profession's relationship to race and ethnicity. B. J. Palmer held troublesome attitudes toward Jewish people and African-Americans, and Palmer College of Chiropractic had a racial bar in admissions until after Brown v. Board of Education. Furthermore, it is likely that B. J. was not alone among chiropractors on these points. Other schools also discriminated, and even the ones that did not do so officially maintained a passive segregation, with few attempts to integrate the profession. As a result, until recently, few African-Americans became chiropractors. Their under-representation is why this book does not directly engage the experiences of people of color in the profession. Rather, I focus on the racial subtext that has shaped understandings of \"success\" and what it means to be \"mainstream,\" and on the overlap between chiropractic and some forms of white nationalism. 10 i n t r o d u c t i o n The chiropractic story cuts sharply against the historiography of alternative medicine. In the United States, much scholarship on alternative medicine has seen it as part of a \"holistic\" paradigm associated with the 1960s counterculture, \"progressive\" lifestyles, and with the East and West Coasts geographically (i.e., \"Blue States\"). I do not contest the relationship between alternative medicine and alternative spirituality, and by extension, of the ties bonding holistic health culture to \"progressive\" lifestyles. Still, I feel this representation is too simple and by itself incomplete. Not only does the chiropractic movement resist this characterization, there is ample evidence that alternative health practices are hardy and abundant in \"Red State\" America. While chiropractic has been tremendously important in the proliferation of \"alternative\" medicine and religion, its interactions with institutional religions are more difficult to capture. For the record, I know of few studies that address religious affiliation by profession, though the Pew Research Center evaluated the beliefs of scientists by their fields. With some qualifications, the spiritual commitments of chiropractors appear to comport with the general U.S. population. Many chiropractors are Roman Catholics, or denominational or Evangelical Protestants. Mormons are also well-represented in chiropractic; it is worth noting the presence of Latter-day Saints among early chiropractic \"pioneers,\" including John Howard, who founded the National College of Chiropractic and Nephi L. C ottam, an early proponent of cranial manipulation. While Jewish Americans have recently joined the profession in greater numbers than in years past, they are not over-represented as in regular medicine. Some of these constituencies are served by faith-specific professional organizations, including the Christian Chiropractors Association, the Catholic Chiropractors Association, and the now-defunct Association of Orthodox Jewish Chiropractors. These \"para-church institutions\" provide networking and fellowship, as well as creative adaptations of chiropractic metaphysics to the theology of their respective traditions. On the East and West Coasts, especially, a great many chiropractors engage with \"New Age\" spirituality. Others distance themselves from organized expressions and prefer a more vague interpretation of being \"spiritual but not religious.\" Across these different faith commitments, however, there is a great variety of personal interpretations of Chiropractic Philosophy. These differences have a stronger impact on the profession than denominational affiliation. Chiropractic Philosophy is so embedded in the history of the profession that even chiropractors who reject it must negotiate its impact on their interpretation of the system. i n t r o d u c t i o n 11 overview of the book The Palmers' writing is an amalgam of their own work, that of contributors who willingly forewent recognition, and (at least in the case of B. J.), outright plagiarism from other sources. I have come to understand such \"pilfering\" as a feature of the entire genre of populist intellectual writing. In choosing sources by which to show the Palmers' thought, I have chosen to focus on sources that would hold up to authorial scrutiny. Chapter 1, \"The First Adjustment: A Chiropractic Story,\" relates the discovery of chiropractic by D. D. Palmer in the mid-1890s. Here I discuss the meaning of the history of their profession to chiropractors and introduce two main themes, vitalism and populism, as major forces in the emergence of alternative medicine in the nineteenth century. I started out on this project in the hope of developing a unified theory for alternative religion and medicine. Since then, my aspirations about comprehensive theories have grown more modest, but I believe these two themes remain helpful heuristics. Chapter 2, \"A Magnetic Healer in Iowa,\" considers the early life of D. D. Palmer. It explores the roots of chiropractic in magnetic healing, and discusses the changes in that practice from its eighteenth-century form as mesmerism through its nineteenth-century encounter with neurology and other modern medical sciences. Chapter 3, \"From Vital Magnetism to Vertebral Vitalism,\" presents the steps by which early chiropractic became an organized system of health care: the elaboration of chiropractic theories, the establishment of training institutes like the Palmer School of Chiropractic (PSC) in Davenport, Iowa, and the making of a collective consciousness for the profession. D. D. had considerable help from his son, B. J. Palmer, in \"developing\" chiropractic theory, though their relationship was fraught with hostility. As the number of practitioners grew, the Palmers benefited from professional collaborations and also faced bitter competition from past colleagues who became rivals. Chapters 4 and 5 continue tracing the institutional growth of chiropractic, with special attention to the role of ideas and theories in building the profession. \"On the Frontier of the New Profession\" considers the years from 1903 to 1910, when D. D. and B. J. Palmer tried unsuccessfully to share power at the Palmer School of Chiropractic. \"Chiropractors on Parade\" addresses the eclipse of D. D. by B. J. in leading both the proprietary school and the burgeoning chiropractic movement. It is in this climate of marginalization, I argue, that D. D. made his most elaborate \"religious turn,\" with the creation of the Third Chiropractic Theory. 12 i n t r o d u c t i o n Chapter 6, \"History Repeats\" turns full attention to B. J. Palmer, to show how his biography recapitulated situations faced by his father. B. J. offered himself as a cultural icon to the chiropractic profession and the American public, whether they wanted him or not. For those loyal to him, he was a cathectic symbol, a form who modeled their own experience, writ large on a big screen. Endowed with energy and creativity, B. J. was dispossessed of leadership when a rationalizing profession rejected proprietary models, especially B. J.'s autocratic claims to power. In later life he, like D. D. Palmer, made a \"spiritual turn\" that restored Metaphysical possibilities to Straight Chiropractic. When B. J. Palmer died in 1961, his son, David Daniel Palmer, was already managing most of the day-to-day operations at the PSC The death of his father allowed the younger Palmer to align the school with mainstream standards of education. With a series of decisive legal and policy victories, the profession also normalized its position in American society. The Palmers' legacy and personas endure, however, in the Straight Chiropractic movement. Chapter 7, \"The World of Chiropractic,\" focuses on the later twentieth century, and considers how the U.S. experience bears on the profession as chiropractic grows internationally in the new millennium. By the late 1990s chiropractic was viewed, for the most part, as a conventional form of health care in North America. I address the enduring role of vitalism and populism and return to the question of spirituality to show how metaphysics may bear on chiropractic as it takes root in other countries. Much more work needs to be done on international issues surrounding alternative religion and medicine. I hope this monograph helps sketch the particular American contours of the profession in a way that is helpful to its international interpretation. i n t r o d u c t i o n 13 chapter one the first adjustment Not a chiropractic seminar goes by without the phrase. It's as if there is some unspoken rule that at some point, or several in some cases, that it must be uttered. The phrase of course is, \"Tell the Story.\" \u2014Steve Tullius, DC w h at i s c h i r o p r a c t i c ? A person seeking treatment for the first time is quite likely to be suffering from back pain. Chiropractors maintain the practice can help many conditions, but spinal and musculoskeletal problems are patients' primary reasons for initial visits. A patient's first impressions draw comparisons to a new patient visit with a physician. Though as likely to be located in a shopping center as a medical office park, the chiropractor's office will resemble that of a medical doctor. After being escorted from the waiting area into the examining room, a patient is asked to complete a health-history questionnaire. The patient might be impressed by the level of detail devoted to the \"intake,\" and may also find the \"bedside manner\" of the chiropractor more caring and congenial than many medical practitioners. With the help of an assistant, the chiropractor will conduct both a general physical exam and a survey of the spinal column. Posture and patterns of mobility in activities like walking will be evaluated. Suffering from back trouble, the patient may be surprised to see so much attention given to the neck. It is quite likely a series of x-rays will be taken. The chiropractor then will present the findings to the patient: pointing out misalignments of vertebrae and explaining their effect on soft tissues, and recommending a course of treatment. There is a good possibility the chiropractor will explain that the word \"chiropractic\" means \"done by 14 hand\" or even \"hand-fixing.\" Indeed, physical touch is the basis for the system. Treatment is likely to include some form of \"spinal manipulation\" described to the patient as a \"chiropractic adjustment.\" The chiropractor will press or push on various points on the spinal column, and will pull, twist, and rotate the limbs and torso, sometimes using the entire body for leverage. Chiropractic can be a vigorous, forceful experience, with jarring thrusts and the disconcerting sound of \"popping\" vertebrae. Some chiropractors use a spring-loaded device, as small as a fountain pen, to deliver a concentrated force to a targeted region. Patients will hear this more gentle treatment described as \"Activator Technique.\" Chiropractic has many forms, from hard to soft, and with different underlying theories. The phenomenon of technique-patenting has led to an almost infinite variety of branded systems. Some of the best known include Basic, Axis-Only, Diversified, Activator, Sacro-Occipital and Gonstead (the last being most closely modeled on the techniques of D. D. Palmer). Patients in acute pain, as many are, will be sent home with advice for palliative management\u2014directions on activity, rest, ice or heat packs, and possibly a set of exercises intended to restore mobility. The chiropractor may recommend over-the-counter painkillers for pain management\u2014or may warn against these vehemently. It is almost certain the patient will be advised to return for a follow-up visit. Over the next few days, the patient may find he or she really does feel better\u2014often well enough to cancel the follow-up. Appointment reminders from office staff, and sometimes from the treating chiropractor, encourage new patients to return. The ones who do will have their progress monitored. The chiropractor will be sympathetic if the course of healing appears lengthy, and recommend a course of treatment for the ensuing weeks. If the pain has cleared up, the returning patient will be put on a schedule of \"maintenance\" and \"preventative\" chiropractic care. After the office visit, the patient may wonder about what the chiropractor said and did. Exactly what is a \"subluxation\"? What is so special about the chiropractic \"wellness paradigm\"? And why, if one's lower back is hurting, would the adjustment be on one's neck? To really understand chiropractic is to know its origins, terminology, scientific theory and therapeutic logic in the way that chiropractors themselves do. Among other things, it is to learn the story chiropractors tell about their history. But what are the true origins of chiropractic? What is the beginning of the \"chiropractic story\"? And what bearing does it have on the contemporary practice? t h e f i r s t a d j u s t m e n t 15 the birth of chiropractic The \"discovery\" of chiropractic has become a core foundation myth for the profession. Several versions circulate in chiropractic histories and original sources, but the basic story stays the same.1 It begins in Davenport, Iowa, a prosperous town on the Mississippi River, where a Canadian immigrant named Daniel David Palmer was operating a successful \"magnetic healing\" practice in a downtown office building. At some point in the fall of 1895, D. D. had a friendly conversation with the custodian, Harvey Lillard. They must have spoken loudly, because according to the story, eighteen years prior Lillard had lost nearly all his hearing at the precise moment that \"something gave way\" in his spine. Laughing over a joke, D. D. slapped Lillard heartily on the back, perhaps with the book he was carrying, after which, they maintained, Lillard's previously impaired hearing was noticed to be somewhat improved. Several days later, Palmer began treating Lillard by pressing on his upper vertebrae, where he claimed to have noticed a protrusion\u2014possibly a bone out of place. Eventually, in a moment of frustration, D. D. took an in-character swat at the bump, which \"instantly gave way\" beneath the force of the thrust. Lillard's deafness was spontaneously gone. In the story chiropractors tell about the roots of their profession, this incident prompted D. D. Palmer to begin studying the role of the spinal column in bodily health and illness, which led him to discover a healing practice that has changed the world. Those skeptical of the chiropractic profession doubt this rendition, and the miraculous quality of the \"Lillard Incident\" has led even chiropractic historians to see it as apocryphal, or at the very least, heavily embellished. For reasons that will be made clear, the Palmers were and are controversial figures in the chiropractic world. Some chiropractors prefer to downplay the Palmers' contributions or reject them outright, while others, known as \"Super Straights,\" accept the Palmers' theories in their entirety, and regard the founders with reverence. Regardless of their esteem for the Palmers, the Lillard Incident is the story chiropractors use most often to note the beginning of their profession. It is undisputed that at some point between 1895 and 1896, D. D. began to offer a drugless therapy, similar to magnetic healing, that he sought to distinguish as a new system. After D. D. cured the Rev. Samuel Henry Weed of \"sciatic rheumatism,\" the Presbyterian minister named the new treatment \"chiropractic\" to capture its essence as \"hand-fixing.\"2 Over the next several years D. D. Palmer began to form a theory explaining the effectiveness of the new treatment. He soon was joined in this endeavor by his son, B. J., who in 16 t h e f i r s t a d j u s t m e n t 1902 took over management of the fledgling Palmer School of Chiropractic, Davenport, where up until the 1970s three-quarters of American chiropractors earned their degrees.3 The Palmers were joined by allies and competitors, all eager to advance the new discovery. Chiropractic quickly became hristian the most controversial \"healing cult\" (overtaking that honor from C Science), with the Palmers' involvement being one of the main causes. Even so, these early chiropractic pioneers modeled a feistiness critical to the profession's decades-long struggle for legitimacy. Today, chiropractic is the most patronized form of alternative medicine in America. By some estimates, more than 7 percent of the U.S. population, 22 million people, visit chiropractors every year.4 It makes sense that D. D. and B. J. Palmer should become hated and hagiographic figures. Like its predecessors, the contemporary chiropractic world is both emulative and rejecting of the establishment, and several scholars have noted the ongoing ambivalence about social status.5 The story of the \"Discovery of Chiropractic\" invokes classic populist and individualist ideals, and taps into Americans' enduring fascination with a type of \"great man\": the misunderstood genius, the \"maverick,\" lone inventor who makes a great contribution to humanity despite the skepticism of established authorities. Regardless of its literal truth, the \"Chiropractic Story\" is true in a mythic sense, and that may be more important. Positioning chiropractic as having a distinct origin, theory, and practice was crucial to the success of the early profession, because when chiropractic began to spread it was a close cousin in a family of very closely related systems of healing. One of the difficulties in charting the history of chiropractic is that so much that is integral to its story happened long before D. D. Palmer struck Harvey Lillard between the shoulders. Sketching some broad historical developments will make my subsequent argument about chiropractic easier to follow. While the next few pages may seem to become a thicket of arcane medical knowledge and cranky social history, they are meant to carry the reader toward a central insight about chiropractic: that its therapeutic logic derives from ideas that were widely recognized in nineteenth-century alternative medicine, which itself had both a distinct intellectual inheritance and a specific social context of origin. There will be a lot of ground to cover to arrive at understanding why nineteenth-century American health culture was so receptive to the belief that one could cure illnesses by pressing or rubbing on the back. But I ask the reader to keep one point in mind: the healing movements of the nineteenth century were highly charged systems of belief in which science, religion, and political sentiment were fused together. t h e f i r s t a d j u s t m e n t 17 p o p u l a r p h y s i o l o g y : v i ta l i s t a n d p o p u l i s t D. D.'s amazing discovery happened in the 1890s, when Progressive Era health culture reflected the complexities of its historical moment.6 Studies on Progressive Era culture often frame it as a time of ambivalence and ambiguity: torn between optimism and cognitive dissonance, what we apprehend as \"modernity\" and something much older, certainty and a lack thereof, centripetal and centrifugal cultural forces. An array of social changes\u2014industrialism, mass production, communications media, government and corporate bureaucracy, and economic and cultural displacement\u2014converged to create a moment of heightened risk and opportunity for enterprising souls like D. D. Palmer. Medical thought, especially, was caught in the crosscurrents of new scientific knowledge rapidly supplanting many older views and a subtle but persistent receptivity to metaphysical ideas.7 The emergent professionalization of American medicine augmented doctors' standing in American society and enhanced their ability to present orthodox medical practices as normative treatments. However, the rise in physicians' status preceded most progress in the treatment of disease. In many ways, by the 1890s American medicine was starting to resemble the system we have today. Advances across the sciences had helped change medicine, mostly for the better. Structural anatomy had mapped the organs and systems of the human body, and organic chemistry delivered a better understanding of animal nutrition. Perhaps most important, in the last third of the nineteenth century, improvements to microscope lenses gave the instruments the high-definition capacity to identify cell structures and foreign bacteria. As a result, the new field of bacteriology offered better theories of contagion, which helped direct greater public attention to sanitation. Yet American health and well-being formed a patchwork of experiences that differed according to race, geographic location, culture, and social class. Between domestic migration and immigration, the population of American cities and towns had burgeoned, and these conditions spread diseases like tuberculosis, the leading cause of death.8 In the late nineteenth century, American longevity actually declined compared to earlier decades. Furthermore, while medical discoveries offered improved understandings of pathology, they conferred fewer therapeutic benefits. A skilled physician might be able offer an accurate diagnosis of diabetes or cancer, but could do little beyond palliative care for such grave conditions. Not surprisingly, Americans' embrace of new paradigms, such as the germ theory of disease or the adoption 18 t h e f i r s t a d j u s t m e n t of mass vaccination, was uneven. The discrepancy between the positioning of physicians as new cultural authorities and their real curative capabilities aggravated populist resentments and helped generate the backlash of movements which competed for the allegiance of American health consumers. This turned health culture into a form of social protest, and thereby a site for interesting ideological battles in which both sides mixed real and imagined concerns. A person falling ill had many therapeutic options. \"Regular\" or \"orthodox\" medicine was the system most patronized throughout the nineteenth century, but it was challenged by a host of \"irregular\" practices, including botanicism, \"eclectic medicine,\" homeopathy, hygienic principles, and \"hydrotherapy.\" Health reformers offered their new systems to American consumers as safer, more pleasant options, and sometimes this was true. Even in the late nineteenth century, some \"orthodox\" physicians continued to practice \"heroic\" medicine, which relied heavily on bleeding the patient and purging them with emetics.9 Moreover, the uneven quality of medical train rthodox ing meant there was often little difference between the abilities of o physicians and irregulars. D. D. Palmer made appeals to patients' dissatisfaction with regular medicine, representing his own treatments as a safer, more humane alternative to brutal surgeries. Through the 1890s, almost every edition of his self-published newspapers carried an illustrative article, entitled \"Cancers\u2014Their Cause and Cure.\" \"The generally accepted and college-taught theory is that lupus and cancer are local diseases, hence cutting, eating, or burning them out is the treatment to be used, and this is suggested to you as the only means by which your life can be saved. . . . Anyone who has ever had a lupus or cancer burned out will admit that the pain produced is beyond the power of language to describe. You have been butchered, tortured, deformed, and disfigured. And the saddest and most serious of all is the fact that even after submitting to all the butchery, deformity, etc., you will find the lupus or cancer growing again\u2014there or somewhere else.\"10 Against such injustices D. D. encouraged a popular revolt, so that in 1900 he proclaimed, \"There is an unrest among the intelligent liberty-loving people of America. A longing for something that will cure. They have become tired of drug monopoly and M. D.'s\u2014medical dictators.\"11 Like other health reformers, he capitalized on antiauthoritarian sentiments by presenting his treatment as an alternative to those of a dangerous, elite medical establishment. The social historian Logie Barrow has argued that in Britain, much \"unorthodox\" medicine was the product of a \"democratic epistemology\"\u2014the assumption t h e f i r s t a d j u s t m e n t 19 that laypeople could understand health issues and treat medical conditions.12 In America, too, alternative medicine has been linked to revolts against deferential order.13 Starting in the 1820s, health reformers' calls for independence from a repressive medical establishment strongly echoed the Jacksonian values of democracy and individualism.14 They held up the capabilities of common people against the brutal medical profession, thereby invoking populist preferences for self-reliance and disdain for formal education and the posturing of professionals. Thus, the entrepreneurial spirit of alternative medicine was often coupled with\u2014and even cloaked by\u2014a rhetoric that made strong appeals to the rugged individualism of the \"common man.\" Nineteenth-century thinkers of many orientations shared a \"style of thought\" which was both antiauthoritarian and strongly dogmatic in its own right.15 In a manner consistent with the preaching and exhorting of revivalism, nineteenth-century rhetoric used a highly moralized language, not only in the contested arena of religion, but also in many other areas of life, where many social and intellectual questions were framed as ultimate questions. The factionalism in nineteenth-century American medicine often expressed itself in a language of religious schism.16 Medical irregulars championed a radical \"intellectual protestantism\" throughout the nineteenth century, as when in 1900 a Canadian minister (denomination unspecified) wrote, \"Medical works, like those on theology, are within reach of all those who desire to read them.\"17 In the period's health discourse, the conflict was portrayed as one between \"orthodoxy\" and \"heresy.\" Orthodox medicine sometimes was presented as a protector of the social order. In this sense, the \"heresy\" it fought represented pernicious social unrest. Many health protesters aligned with other types of cultural radicalism, supporting progressive social causes like abolition, women's suffrage, and the labor movement. The religions many health reformers found attractive, like Spiritualism, Adventism, Mind Cure, and nonbelief, made them \"heretical\" in the conventional sense. The phrase \"medical sectarian\" first was meant negatively, but irregulars embraced this language of religious persecution. In this way Edward Bliss Foote praised eclectic medicine: \"Eclecticism is as much a protest in the field of medicine as was Luther's Reformation in the domain of religion. We are protestants against the old dogmas of medicine, just as the disciples of Luther were protestants against the dogmas of the Papal church. . . . Eclectism is, therefore, a protest against the old methods of practice, and is the direct outgrowth of the people, and we may say, of the common people.\"18 This sentiment was still strong decades later, when D. D. Palmer invoked a metaphor of the \"Priesthood of All Believers\" in matters of health and illness. 20 t h e f i r s t a d j u s t m e n t D. D. proclaimed, \"Every man and every woman who can cure is divinely ordained to heal, and their duty to God and humanity demands that they do it. The license of all such is a natural license, which no legislature nor bigoted board of medical monopolists may revoke.\"19 Let me point out once more the remarkable intermingling of religious and political language in these statements. They become more intelligible when one considers how health reformers like E. B. Foote or D. D. Palmer came to believe what they did: they were almost entirely self-taught. To a person interested in the pursuit of knowledge, America in the Progressive Era was a magical place. Thanks to a burgeoning print industry, there was a feast of things to read.20 Many print technologies had improved over the course of the nineteenth century. The development of a domestic paper industry made paper cheaper and more widely available. The previously laborious process of printing grew faster. Electroplating, stereotyping, and typesetting machines reduced the time it took to set type, while rotary presses increased the number of pages that could be printed per hour. Even the quality of inks improved. Other structural changes contributed to America's becoming a nation of readers. The emergence of a market economy ensured the steady growth of text-based culture. Transportation networks, first as roads, canals and waterways, and railroads soon after, brought printed materials across the growing United States. Before long, relatively cheap copies of mass-produced books were available in even the most isolated corners of the nation. In the nineteenth century, \"learning\" and \"discovery\" were watchwords of the age. As American culture developed beyond the confines of particular villages, much of its growth took place in the form of collective commitment not only to particular causes, such as temperance or antislavery, but also to general intellectual endeavors, like the study of natural history or the reading of \"quality literature.\"21 From the Early Republic into the Jacksonian Era, various stakeholders in American society saw education as the key to spiritual growth, moral \"improvement,\" political emancipation, and economic success.22 As a result, small towns nurtured popular education through local intellectual societies. Known as \"lyceums,\" these social clubs hosted weekly gatherings for lectures and discussion groups. When, in the Progressive Era, lyceum culture declined, it was replaced by \"Chautauquas,\" which hosted periodic gatherings. While the name for these events derived from a famous site in New York State, most were \"circuit chautauquas\": consortia of local meetings that used commercial bureaus to book traveling speakers and performers. Such networks flourished into t h e f i r s t a d j u s t m e n t 21 the early twentieth century, with tens of millions of individual tickets sold in a given year. The Chautauqua movement also helped create \"reading circles\": clubs that met weekly to discuss books in a set curriculum, which were heavily patronized by the American middle class. The culture of adult education was especially strong in Iowa, where chiropractic began. The first lyceum in Davenport was organized in 1839, right about the time that the territory began to be settled. In the early twentieth century, Iowa may have been the state with the largest number of independent Chautauqua groups\u2014forty-seven in 1906.23 The historian David D. Hall has described popular print culture as \"a middling social and cultural space in which many texts seem to have circulated widely.\"24 This is an appropriate place to explore his term and a synonym used a lot in this book: \"popular intellectual culture.\" Both refer to the genres of literature that were mass-produced and mass-marketed in nineteenth-century America, as well as the conversations these texts generated and the social milieus that supported them. I use \"popular intellectual culture\" to describe a set of nineteenth-century discourses: conversations of ideas one can track through bodies of connected literature, as well as philologically through the print media of greater American society. Popular intellectual culture was sustained by texts and sets of ideas, but there is a critical human element as well. Popular intellectual culture thrived \"off the page\"\u2014in study circles, lecture halls, local societies, and national associations. Such encounters always had structured programs or curricula, but they also were events where knowledge was transmitted through deeply personal interactions, giving them a \"dual function\" as sites for the formal and informal exchange of ideas.25 Through the example of chiropractic, I hope to show how popular intellectual subcultures, like any social worlds, are affected by alliances and rivalries, hierarchies and rebellions, bitter animosities and deep affective bonds. And\u2014important but sometimes overlooked\u2014in such social worlds both personal strengths and human frailties can be active historical forces. All these dynamics appeared in chiropractic, and in many other expressions of medical, spiritual, and cultural reform. Let me now build on the notion of \"popular\" toward the related idea of \"populist\" intellectual culture. Ironically, at the same moment that public education was becoming available to increasing numbers of Americans and literacy rates were soaring, a suspicion of formal education bordering on outright hostility also developed .26 The force and staying power of this sentiment is evident in a statement D. D. Palmer wrote at the turn of the century. \"Perhaps I was 22 t h e f i r s t a d j u s t m e n t unfortunate in my education. I was not educated in a college. If I had been, the probability is that I would have never got out of the fossilized ideas of the profession. I was educated to dare to think, and think for myself; not to take any man's say so when I could think and prove a problem to myself.\"27 Not only was D. D.'s lack of schooling a point of personal pride, but he also seems to have known it would register positively with his readers. Many of them were likely to be creative people with little formal education, who were interested in learning, and yet were largely self-taught. Autodidacticism had been a common approach to learning for centuries. Combined with the explosion of texts in the print revolution, self-study expanded, with dramatic consequences for how Americans engaged information and discerned what they, as individuals regarded to be \"true.\" The result was a new intellectual style, characterized by a radically individualist epistemology, whereby \"Intuition\" and personal judgment became seen as the most trustworthy bases for knowledge.28 Ernst Troeltsch was one of the first observers to connect the print revolution to changes in modern intellectual and religious life.29 Troeltsch proposed that the barrage of information suddenly available to lay people in the nineteenth century had caused a fundamental shift in how they encountered knowledge. Previously, he argued, truth was external, determined by the clergy, or by the Bible, which was commonly viewed as the single most important text in Western civilization. Popular print gave common people choices in what to read. The knowledge at the core of our worldviews became, he argued, intensely subjective. In The Social Teachings of the Christian Churches, Troeltsch identified this dynamic as a major expression of modern religious life, and he gave it the two names \"Intellectual Mysticism\" and \"Spiritual Religion.\" His use of the former term is unfortunate, for Troeltsch was not describing any of the sensory alterations usually associated with the term \"mysticism.\" Rather, Troeltsch was highlighting the radical individualism of the modern religious experience. Troeltsch found evidence of this change in a wide range of spiritual and intellectual projects, including Romantic philosophy and the development of comparative religion out of the study of theology. He also saw it behind \"the undercurrents of religious life which mostly pass unnoticed,\" such as Swedenborgianism, Spiritualism, and Theosophy.30 Writing in 1912, Troeltsch observed that the individualist dynamic was especially present in the United States and he predicted that over the twentieth century, Spiritual Religion would become dominant in American religious life. Spiritual Religion thus captures a progression of nineteenth- and twentieth-century American spiritual movements, including Transcendentalism, Christian Science, and New Thought, whose shared features have been noted by other scholars. t h e f i r s t a d j u s t m e n t 23 It also anticipates the decentralizing and disaffiliation of American religious life today, where \"none\" and \"spiritual but not religious,\" have become prominent labels for religious self-identification. Troeltsch's insight about the Modern period was that social change recast the mechanism for religious authority and put it within individual actors. Courtney Bender follows Troeltsch's line of thought to argue that individual religious experience is at the center of Metaphysical projects and modern religious encounters more broadly.31 Both the Palmers and many other chiropractic innovators corroborate her observation. But even more so, the chiropractic story reinforces the earlier half of Troeltsch's point that popular print\u2014and the democratizing discursive communities it fostered\u2014was a primary force in the rise of spiritual individualism and the making of what Matt S. Hedstrom has described as \"a priesthood of all readers.\"32 And while Troeltsch focused his discussion of the decentering of epistemological authority on the Industrial Revolution, the patterns he called attention to have become even more pronounced in the electronic age. Populist intellectual culture oriented around particular endeavors. Often, nineteenth-century Americans found creative outlets in the world of science.33 Their interest in scientific matters is evidenced by the emergence of numerous local scientific societies and publications like Popular Science Monthly. More importantly, the prevalence of the term \"scientific\" points to a sudden valuing of science in American society, and illustrates how the intellectual emancipation of the yeomanry manifested as a widespread belief in the ideal of progress. Many social movements, including spirit ommunity, ualism, Fourierism and the Bible Communism of the Oneida C proclaimed their worth as \"scientific\" endeavors. To be \"scientific\" meant organizing information systematically. D. D. held on to this understanding in his assertion decades later that \"science is knowledge reduced to law and embodied in a system.\"34 As a result, the broad use of the term came at the cost of its meaning, so that \"scientific\" became a fashionable way for status-seekers to present themselves as au courant. Thus, Americans' invocation of science sometimes looked more like a cult of manners than authentic intellectual engagement; today, their \"scientific\" outlook seems crude, like a facsimile of classical education to which few contemporary laboratory researchers would award the scientific label. Still, neither the historic overuse of the word \"scientific\" nor our doubts about the intellectual rigor of popular science in this period invalidates the importance of the scientific ideal. Rather, it shows how much conceptual and cultural boundaries were shifting in the nineteenth century. 24 t h e f i r s t a d j u s t m e n t The scientific ideal permeated many aspects of American life, such as usiness and religion, but its manifestation as an explosion of interest in b biology, health, and the body overshadowed all others. As early as 1800, traditional domestic medicine had been affected by the nascent forces of market production and distribution in the form of mass-produced health literature. The market for such information increased dramatically in the following decades. Publishers like Carey & Lea, J.B. Lippincott, P. Blakiston, and D. Appleton found American readers to be a receptive audience for domestic reprints of well-known European medical texts. The intended market for such literature was physicians, but the general public read it too. What began as a trickle became a flood by the 1870s, when readership of popular medical literature is estimated to have been around 50,000 and William Wood & Company was reprinting European medical texts at the rate of one a month to stock its Library of Standard Medical Authors.35 By 1879, the United States had the largest number of health-related periodicals in the world, with 135 published that year.36 Most of this avalanche of print resonated with a single, distinctive \"popular physiology,\" the conventional wisdom of nineteenth-century health culture.37 While the specific scientific meaning of \"physiology\" is the study of bodily functions, the term \"popular physiology\" springs from the work of period health reformers, several of whom took the term as title for their books.38 In popular health literature, it meant a description of activities of the body, as well as hypotheses as to causes of health and illness and recommendations for preserving health in light of the body's functions. Popular physiology was more than biological theory: it blended scientific ideas, religious beliefs, metaphysical concepts, and political ideology. It was different from the \"folk medicine\" of earlier periods, for it carried traditional knowledge and assumptions and incorporated modern developments, like more detailed understandings of human anatomy. Popular physiology held together conceptually because American regular and irregular medicine were based on common scientific substrates through much of the nineteenth century. In the 1820s, the theories of biology upholding Thomsonianism were broadly similar to those supporting \"Heroic\" medicine. Each system recognized \"congestion\" (and its ensuing pressure imbalances) as a major disease factor. They only differed on the appropriate remedy. For allopathic physicians, this meant bloodletting; Thomsonians preferred steam baths and \"pukeweed.\" This comity was possible because, despite rhetorical rivalries and real therapeutic differences, regulars and irregulars used many of the same sources of medical information. t h e f i r s t a d j u s t m e n t 25 Through much of the nineteenth century, irregulars and many regulars shared a medical perspective that assigned healing to the \"power of Nature,\" which animated the body. \"Nature\" here was construed as a \"vital force\" that was the secret to life itself. This paradigm had both religious and scientific origins. In fact, vitalism has a long presence in both Western medical and metaphysical thought. The term refers to any theory that sees life as a product of an autonomous, purposeful force or presence in the universe. Vitalism is not a single intellectual perspective, but is better understood as a set of concepts that has informed a series of schools of Western natural philosophy. Belief in a \"vital principle\" can be traced back to the metaphysical theories of classical Greek philosophers. For Galen, arguably the theorist most influential to western medical thought from classical times to the Middle Ages, the vital force was an ethereal fluid coursing through the body, which Galenic medicine termed \"animal spirits.\" The collective legacy of Greek scientific thought was a complex understanding of the human being, which was held to be comprised of both a rational soul and an amalgamation of other innate forces. This perspective characterized much of the Western understanding of the body and soul into the Renaissance. It continues to reverberate through much contemporary holistic medicine, in which various forces and energies are seen to animate the human being and the world. Historically, vitalists have divided on many issues. Some ascribed a form of intentionality to the vital force, understanding it as an autonomous, independent spirit.39 In these interpretations \"life\" was a power with an existence independent from individual organisms. The belief in a purposeful vital force lent itself to various spiritual conceptions. In some instances, the vital force was equated with the immortal human soul, here referring to the rational human intellect or seat of personal individuality. In others, vitality was understood as a manifestation of the divine power of God, separate and transcendent from the individual human spirit. For spiritually oriented vitalists, this force behind our reality often was viewed as \"supra-natural\" rather than supernatural. That is to say, the occult force was held to be the most fundamentally real aspect of the material existence of the natural world. Vitalist theorists stand out for their frequent endorsement of realities like \"spiritual matter,\" and hypotheses about the true \"seat of the soul\" in the body. In some conceptions, theorists specifically identified particular organs such as the heart or brain as centers for bodily vitality. The dominance of the fluidic interpretations of Galen in Western medical thought, however, directed many vitalists to focus on physical conduits for a liquid substance within the human body. They tended to focus on either the nervous or circulatory 26 t h e f i r s t a d j u s t m e n t systems as conduits for animating power. The reality of venous circulation readily accounts for its association with the life principle by both Aristotle and William Harvey. Over time, though, more thinkers appear to have subscribed to a belief in \"nervous circulation.\" Galen considered the nerves to be a minuscule system of tube-like conduits with the \"animal spirits\" constituting a liquid coursing through the body in these tiny pipes.40 These different, anatomically specific representations of the vital principle support the common idea that the material and immaterial are coextensive in human anatomy, and that particular organs, structures, or tissues mediate the physical body and metaphysical reality. These beliefs tie together many different expressions of irregular and alternative medicine. Vitalist thought illustrates how modern scientific ideas did not develop smoothly, but had both intellectual continuities and breaks with the past. In the seventeenth century, rationalists like the French physician-philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes articulated a very different theory, holding that organic processes depended on the collision and vibration of the tiny molecule-like \"corpuscles\" that were the building blocks of all matter. Cartesian dualism contributed to several \"mechanist\" theories of human biology that emerged through the eighteenth century, which understood the body as a machine with clockwork-like parts. One such system was eighteenth century \"humoral\" medicine, well-known for bleeding and purging; these therapies were believe to be effective means of relieving various kinds of physical pressures in the body. But Descartes's interest in neurology aligned him practically with vitalists studying the nervous system, like the English physician Thomas Willis.41 Most important, Cartesian philosophy probed the link between mind and body, starting a discussion that is of great importance in Metaphysical healing and spirituality. In the early nineteenth century, vitalist theories gained a following at the medical schools in Montpellier, France and Edinburgh, Scotland.42 These were the versions that most directly influenced nineteenth-century American medical thought. American practitioners turned to vitalism as a means of rejecting \"heroic therapeutics,\" the dominant medical paradigm at the time. John Harley Warner has argued persuasively for the influence of French vitalist theory on American medicine as it transitioned away from heroic treatments.43 The Montpellier school held even greater sway among the irregulars, who regularly cited them as medical authorities. The spread of the vitalist idea is a remarkable example of what David Jaffee called the \"Village E nlightenment\"\u2014the arrival of elite knowledge in popular intellectual culture.44 By mid-century, nourishing bodily vitality had t h e f i r s t a d j u s t m e n t 27 become a dominant paradigm for health and illness. Vitalism found a hospitable climate in nineteenth-century America at a time when \"realities of the unseen\" were embraced across disparate arenas of life. Scientists were developing sophisticated theories about light, gravity, and planetary orbit, which were still unknown enough to hold a mystical quality, so that they were described as \"imponderables.\" In religion, Evangelical theology placed personal feeling as the source of religious truth, while Neoplatonic idealism was endorsed by almost every expression of alternative spirituality. It is important not to overstate the scope and importance of vitalist ideas to American medical thought, or the relative importance of Continental Europe versus the British Isles as influences on America. English and S cottish physicians continued to be leading authorities through much of the nineteenth century, as is evidenced by their dominance in foreign medical literature. American medicine, however, appears to have been increasingly indebted to Continental discoveries. In addition to the sudden influx of imported and reprinted books into the American market, other forms of medical literature offer evidence of a widespread European influence. A number of periodicals like the New York Journal of Medicine and the American Journal of the Medical Sciences published excerpts from the writing of important European theorists and articles explaining the new physiology to American doctors. These periodicals extended access to Continental medical ideas beyond readers with the means to buy books. The excerpts from medical \"classics\" were printed so as to be detachable from the journals themselves. Readers then could bind these booklets into permanent additions to their personal \"medical libraries,\" something D. D. Palmer himself would do, after a fashion, with his \"Portable Library.\" Medical literature also included domestic writing, a phenomenon that increased through the nineteenth century. Here, too, the impact of European thought can be discerned. American authors appropriated the mantle of authority from European sources, quoting them liberally, though not always with attribution. Although scholarly attention to the nationalist sentiments of medical sectarians has helped create a consensus that these groups rejected European medical ideas in an effort to create a wholly \"American\" health culture, in reality, the picture is not quite so simple. My research indicates that the phenomenon of sectarians' drawing on European medical authorities was deep and widespread. European medical ideas were not ubiquitous in sectarian thought. They appeared, however, in the work of a number of prominent health reformers. Many of them had prior training as regular physicians, especially in the eclectic, botanic, and reformed systems. Widely read and 28 t h e f i r s t a d j u s t m e n t circulated, their work helped shape the core theories of their healing systems. These individuals themselves were quoted by a great number of sectarians. It thus appears that a relatively small number of American sectarians familiar with orthodox medicine were responsible for the importation of international knowledge into American alternative medicine. The use of such knowledge by sectarians took multiple forms, all reflecting their engagement in a shared discourse with medical regulars. Popular health innovators relied on mainstream medical literature for basic anatomical and physiological information, and often lifted detailed descriptions of bodily systems from orthodox literature for inclusion in their own written work. In this sense, their use was pragmatic. Sectarians' use of descriptions, diagrams and engravings from orthodox sources often was made possible by the genuine intellectual comity that existed between regulars and irregulars. This utilization was neutral, in that the information was not contested but reflected similar working assumptions in regular and irregular medicine. A third mode can be dubbed strategic. Irregular-medicine writers promoted their intellectual authority by showing their familiarity with elite medical literature. To this end, they recreated the intellectual world of regular medical discourse. Sectarians made references to the orthodox medical canon, invoked the authority of the \"great men of medicine\" like Hippocrates, Boerhaave, and Haller, and imitated the style of mainstream medical literature. Finally and most important, irregulars drew selectively on orthodox sources, embracing the ones who upheld vitalism or natural healing. They sometimes made the point of acknowledging an intellectual debt to particular theorists. Stahl and Haller enjoyed places of special reverence as great men of medicine. The American hygiene movement drew on the work of eighteenth- and early-nineteenth-century European vitalists like Simon Andr\u00e9 Tissot.45 the German scientists Johannes M\u00fcller and Justus Liebig became especially popular. Mary Gove (Nichols) learned about M\u00fcller through correspondence with Philadelphia physician David Francis Condie, and Liebig's Animal Chemistry was praised by several sectarians and even was advertised in The Illustrated Hydropathic Review. Sectarians preferred authorities who supported their own priorities, such as the rejection of heroic therapeutics and endorsement of hygienic living. Eclectics and Thomsonians popularized the condemnation of bloodletting by Johann Friedrich Daniel Lobstein, a Paris-trained physician based in New York and later in Philadelphia. Because of his exhaustive research, the physiologist Fran\u00e7ois Magendie was quoted by reformers like Mary Gove, who cited his observations on the ill effects t h e f i r s t a d j u s t m e n t 29 of alcohol. Most important, some American sectarian writers came to see Continental vitalism as the triumph of \"true\" science over dead materialist doctrines\u2014a fact that underscores the importance of the scientific ideal to these health reformers. Vitalist theories of biology flourished in Europe in the late eighteenth century but arrived in the United States later, so that ideas separated by several decades entered American discussions simultaneously and synthetically, as bricolages. Mass production brought both current and outdated medical perspectives with little distinction between them to a general public hungry for \"lighter medical literature,\" as it was advertised by Lea & Blanchard in 1843. This meant that theorists who in Europe were regarded as intellectual adversaries had their views conflated in American popular medical literature. One sees this in Americans' adaptions of the theories of F. J. V. Broussais, one of the most-quoted French medical authorities. Broussais claimed that the ganglia of the autonomic nervous system connected to the \"great sympathetic nerve\" that ran through the solar plexus directly up to the brain. This nerve (nonexistent in contemporary anatomy) was a thoracic counterpart to the spinal cord, and was responsible for all vital functions. Broussais regarded it as the source of most disease: \"The great sympathetic is not sensible in its natural state, but . . . may become so in a pathological condition, when modified by inflammation.\"46 Several kinds of irritation could inflame the great sympathetic nerve, including physical agents such as heat or cold, emotional disruption, as well as the consequences of behavior, habits, and personal vices like overwork or alcoholism. Generally, medical historians do not regard Broussais as an ideal-typical vitalist. Nonetheless, the Broussaisist model thus implied that bodily forces, maleficent or benign, circulated internally, and were regulated by an \"inward providence\" rather than automatic internal processes.47 For this reason, while Broussais is often framed as a \"mechanist,\" the cultural historian Stephen Nissenbaum credits him as the originator of the \"doctrine of vitalism,\" a theory of biology informing the operative logic of both orthodox and irregular medical systems in America.48 By mid-century, nourishing bodily vitality was a popular alternative theory endorsed both by health reformers and forward-thinking \"regular\" physicians. In American health discourse, French vitalist concepts often were conveyed with the term \"vis medicatrix naturae,\" the \"natural healing force\" within the body. This notion arrived in the United States via Montpellier, France, beginning in the 1820s, and has resonated through alternative and complimentary medicine into the present.49 30 t h e f i r s t a d j u s t m e n t Vitalism contributed to a therapeutic logic that recurred in the theories of many irregular medical systems, in which heterogeneous conceptions of illness were collapsed into a single category. Popular physiology explained the symptoms of disease as the results of depletions or disruptions of vital energy. Theorists organized numerous \"secondary causes\" of one \"single, proximate cause\" of disease, and thereby created an idiosyncratic etiology that recurred across many irregular systems. The most common factors included insufficient exercise, poor sleep, cold weather, bad air, inadequate bathing, dirty or improper clothing, unclean houses, harmful medicines, dietary problems and indigestion, and injurious mental and emotional states. From a latter-day perspective, many of these recommendations seem to be sensible guides for proper living. The functional nature of such guidelines should not be dismissed, but the logic of the original reformers was remarkably different from our own: all these agents negatively affected the function of the nervous system by impeding its capacity to conduct vital force. This operative logic stood behind many different health theories. For example, health reformer Mary Gove identified the richness of a meat-based diet as a primary cause of disease. \"Now this stimulating diet makes the vital current hurry on its course, and there is a waste of life in proportion to this excess of action. Whatever increases vascular action\u2014in other words, the circulation of the blood\u2014wears out the vital powers faster than they would otherwise wear out. The manner in which stimulating food, condiments, &c., wear out our vital powers, is very analogous to the effect of ardent spirits, only it is a more gradual work.\"50 Other health advocates attributed illness to improper channeling of sexual energies. Vitalism even was invoked in popular crusades against masturbation, as when the evangelical writer Eli Peck Miller argued that the loss of semen overtaxed the nervous system and rendered the entire body vulnerable to derangement and disease. Of \"self-abuse,\" he warned, \"It brings disaster and ruin upon every part of the system; it drains away the life-power, the vitality, the proper elements of health and strength, and destroys the ability to grow and develop, and increase in beauty and vigor; it takes away the materials that are needed to produce a noble, high-toned, healthy, and happy human being; it crushes out the image of God, and stamps in its place that of the destroyer; it withdraws such an amount of life-force from the blood that every organ and tissue of the body is left so enfeebled and debilitated as to become an easy prey to disease. Self-abuse opens the door for consumption, dyspepsia, nervous debility, apoplexy, epilepsy, paralysis, insanity, and almost every disease from which humanity suffers.\"51 t h e f i r s t a d j u s t m e n t 31 v e r t e b r a l v i ta l i s m Americans' commonsense understanding of vitality ushered in a therapeutic directive to nurture the vital principle through proper care of the body and in particular the nervous system. The medical culture of the period was marked by the assumption that bodily vitality was something humans could manipulate. Allopathy, irregular medicine, and home care had ideological and practical differences, but relied on a common goal of creating optimal conditions for transmission of the vital force, which by mid-century was widely believed to reside in the nervous system. Treatments included special diets, monitoring the patient's physical environment and level of activity, and administering or withholding drugs and substances believed to be capable of affecting the nerves. The hydropath Orson Squire Fowler asserted, \"Whether nervous disorders are primary or sympathetic, the effectual means of curing them is to restore the tone and vigor of the SYSTEM AS A WHOLE, by obeying those laws of dietetics, circulation, respiration, sleep, bathing, friction, exercise, and the like, already pointed out. True, health of nerves more effectually promotes general health than perhaps all other instrumentalities.\"52 Fowler's comments about nervous disorders reflect the \"neurocentrism\" of popular physiology.53 In American popular physiology, the nerves were the primary mediator for the vital principle. Perhaps the most famous version of this model was \"neurasthenia,\" articulated in 1869 by George M. Beard. But Beard's \"American Nervousness\" was only one manifestation of a broader nosology focusing on the nervous system. \"Nervous debility\" was a leading trope for illness in nineteenth-century America. The nerves were credited with the regulation of health and subject to the ravages of sickness so much that diseases of the nerves, like \"hysteria\" and \"nervous exhaustion,\" were a major diagnostic category. In an era of cultural preoccupation with the nervous system, it is not surprising that so many health practices should have focused on the regulation of the spinal column. Health reformers and medical sectarians were adjacent to scientific neurology, and responded creatively to their encounter with it. In this context, vertebral vitalism became a widely shared biological paradigm. Through the nineteenth century, neuroscience made great strides. The central nervous system outdistanced the sympathetic nervous system as the primary agent for bodily function. Attention shifted away from the great sympathetic nerve and was redirected onto the brain and spinal cord. Popular vitalist ideas changed accordingly, so that the central nervous system grew to be seen as the preeminent access road to influencing bodily health. This physiology depended on 32 t h e f i r s t a d j u s t m e n t two anatomical assumptions. As the source of \"mental impulse,\" or \"nerve force,\" the brain was held to be the engine of life. Orson Fowler wrote, \"The brain does something besides think and feel. . . . It generates and sends forth that 'vis anumae' or vital spirit which animates all parts of the body, infuses life and action into them, and sets and keeps the entire human machinery in motion; so that its health state is essential to that of the body, and the disease of the one also causes the disease of the other.\"54 In some conceptions, the brain was even seen as the manufacturer of \"nerve juice,\" an interpretation that revealed the longevity of fluidic conceptions of the nervous system.55 While the brain was usually seen as the wellspring of nerve force, the spinal cord was the key highway of nerve transmission between the brain and rest of the body. Brain and spine were interdependent organs, but theorists argued about which deserved greater credit for maintaining organic life. The American eclectic physician John Milton Scudder followed in the footsteps of British vitalist William Benjamin Carpenter to argue that the spine was an independent agent and more important than the brain in controlling vital processes.56 Fellow eclectic Wooster Beach looked to the eighteenth-century German physiologist A lbrecht von Haller for evidence that the \"seat of the soul\" was \"in the head, and not the spinal marrow.\"57 Despite such disagreements, what seems clear is spinal illness figured prominently in period conceptions of disease. Spinal pathology reflected the consensus of nineteenth-century popular medical thought, which collapsed diverse pathologies into simpler categories. Diagnoses could be quite vague, simply referred to as spinal \"illness,\" \"problems,\" or \"distortion.\"58 In popular physiologic discourse, spinal disease was described with a specialized language that appears archaic from a modern perspective.59 One of the most common nineteenth-century pathologies was spinal \"irritation.\" This illness was the result of improper or excessive stimulation of the nervous system, and of the spinal cord in particular.60 The pathology of \"spinal irritation\" was descended from eighteenth-century and older conceptions of nervous \"sensibility\" and \"reactivity.\" Spinal irritation was assumed to be the result of pernicious stimuli acting directly on the nervous system, a hypothesis found in the theories of physiologists as different as William Cullen and F. J. V. Broussais.61 In the 1860s, the logic of spinal irritation was updated by John Eric Erichsen as part of his famous diagnosis of \"railway spine.\"62 Erichsen maintained that the seemingly mild bumps and shocks incurred riding in trains or in railway accidents caused \"molecular derangement\" of the spinal cord. This change he likened to the demagnetization effected on a magnet subjected to repeated blows by a hammer, which stripped away magnetic power. t h e f i r s t a d j u s t m e n t 33 Nineteenth-century interpretations of spinal disease also reflected the belief that internal vitality was conserved in quantity and therefore subject to depletion.63 Spinal illness was therefore often the result of nervous \"exhaustion.\" In such a state, the spinal cord was too drained of vitality to be able to communicate between the brain and body. This was the primary assumption behind George M. Beard's concept of \"neurasthenia.\"64 Beard regarded spinal tenderness as a sign of systemic nervous exhaustion rather than an independent illness. He felt this condition was endemic in the American middle class. \"When the spine is so tender as to become an important and permanent affliction, and to overshadow other symptoms of the neurasthenic states, it is called spinal irritation; but, strictly, it is a symptom, like cerebral irritation, not properly a disease as such, although, as a matter of convenience, there can be no harm practically in describing it as a disease. In regard to this symptom of nervous exhaustion, these points are noticeably: First, its great frequency in the higher classes, especially among women. I suppose if one should go through Fifth Avenue, of New York City, and examine the spines of all the ladies between fifteen and forty-five years of age, he would find in quite a percentage of cases that, at times, there would be tenderness either of the whole length of the spine, or, more likely, at certain points, as the nape of the neck, and between the shoulder-blades, and on the middle lumbar vertebrae. Crawling, creeping, and burning sensations often accompany this tenderness. This condition would be found at times in those who do not call themselves invalids, and who are not under medical treatment. It would furthermore be found that, with some of these cases, there would be tenderness of the scapula or hip bones, of the breast bone, and, indeed, of the whole surface of the body. This general hyperaesthesia [sic], like the local hyperaesthesia of the spine, appears and disappears under any subjective or objective exciting causes, and is attended usually by a feeling of debility, and oftentimes, though not always, by backache, headache, insomnia, and mental depression.\"65 Theorists sometimes proposed that spinal weakness was caused by malnutrition of the nervous system. In turn, this condition was the result of inadequate circulation of the blood. In their starved state of \"anemia,\" the nerves were incapable of performing their function of vital nervous transmission. On the other hand, excessive blood also affected the nerves: spinal \"congestion\" was the result of excessive accumulations of blood pressing too heavily on the spinal cord and causing \"morbid innervation.\"66 This idea preserved the hydraulic paradigm of humoral medicine, continuing the belief that a physical blockage could impair the transmission of vital nervous impulse. Such 34 t h e f i r s t a d j u s t m e n t hypotheses resonated with the fluidic interpretations that still characterized much of the popular understanding of neurology. A hundred years earlier, the magnetic healer Franz Anton Mesmer had called attention to the importance of such internal stoppages. \"Is it not true that coarse, pasty, viscous moods, produced by bad digestion, are occasioned by congestions and obstructions? The absence of freedom in the flow of the universal fluid and in the activity that it should impart to the nerves, and from these to the vessels, must be attributed to these viscosities and to these obstructions.\"67 These theories reflect a blend of medical ideas from several different eras, elite and plebeian knowledge from numerous countries, and many schools of thought. Across them ran a common belief in the important connection of the spine to the rest of the body. Popular physiologists embraced the belief that disturbances in the spine triggered malfunctions in other areas. A problem in the spinal cord could be the source of heart trouble, kidney disease, or pancreatitis. Thus a writer named James Caleb Jackson argued in the Illustrated Hydropathic Review that \"brain exhaustion and spinal irritation\" were behind \"nervous dyspepsia\" by causing \"inflammation of the nerves of the stomach.\"68 Nineteenth-century physiologists concurred on the specific mechanism by which the relationship between the spine and viscera operated. They viewed the nerves exiting the spinal cord and extending through the body as a \"road map\" for transmitting vitality. Tracing the nerves between a body part and the spinal cord would find the remote spinal \"lesion\" that was the real cause of all the trouble for a patient. In Principles of Eclectic Medicine, John Scudder displayed this logic when he connected various ailments to irritation at various points on the spinal column: \"Among the most common examples of this may be named, the irritation of the lumbar spine in disease of the uterine or pelvic viscera; the irritation of the lower dorsal portion of the cord, in diseases of the kidneys and urinary apparatus; the upper dorsal portion of the cord, in diseases of the stomach and associated viscera; the irritation of the cervical portion of the cord, in diseases of the heart; of the posterior basilar expansion of the cord, in lesions of the reproductive system. Conversely, we will find that a spinal irritation of these parts will exercise a direct influence on the organs named, and if severe, will prevent a cure of the visceral diseases. So that many times it is fully as important that the spinal irritation be treated, as that remedies be given for the visceral disease.\"69 The posited relationship between the spine and viscera constituted a new, comprehensive etiology of disease. Vertebral vitalism determined that problems in the spine acted as a remote cause of disease by transmitting t h e f i r s t a d j u s t m e n t 35 dysfunction to other organs. This theory was vitalist insofar as it insisted on the superadded function of the spinal cord, which was the conduit for a force ultimately responsible for the structural well-being of every organ and tissue. At its most extreme versions, \"vertebral vitalism\" was a single-cause theory of disease; it claimed the spinal cord was the only organ in the body that could become truly diseased. One need look no further than the work of Orson Squire Fowler, who was especially confident of the truth of this theory of pathology: \"The cord gives off nerves at each spinal joint to the heart, lungs, stomach, liver, viscera, and all the other internal organs. When these organs become chronically irritated, inflamed, or diseased, their nerves become similarly affected, so that, since each of these nerves unite with the spinal cord at its own particular joint and no other, by pressing on the joint which receives the nerve of the heart, a soreness, perhaps sharp pain, will be experienced by the patient, and thus of all the other internal organs. This test of disease is INFALLIBLE, and tells at once and with certainty whether any of the vital organs are affected, and if so, which\u2014five minutes being sufficient to decide the matter without mistake.\"70 Fowler's mapping of the central nervous system bears a striking resemblance to the paradigms that are central to many forms of chiropractic today. \"Meric\" chiropractic theory aligns the central nervous system with the body by relating different sections of the spinal column with the organs and structures most proximate to the nerves exiting their foramina. Vertebral vitalism was significant both for its newness and because it was an updating of the much older belief in \"sympathy,\" the idea that organs and body parts were capable of affecting others to which they are not anatomically connected. The \"doctrine of sympathies\" posited a fundamental interdependence on the various parts of the body. Traditionally, sympathies could be either beneficial or malign. In the healthy person sympathy represented complete internal harmony\u2014an idea that, coincidentally, has become a mainstay of alternative health philosophy. Sympathies also accounted for the fact that when one body part was diseased or injured, it could transmit a condition of illness or injury to others. Vertebral vitalism superimposed these relationships onto the central nervous system. The doctrine of sympathies also stood behind popular appropriations of scientific discoveries about reflex arcs in the central nervous system. In popular physiology, the transmission of impulses was called in as evidence for the interdependence of bodily organs. By the late nineteenth century, neurologists had systematized the pathways for most of the major reflexes in the human body.71 In popular discourse, however, \"reflex theory\" explained far more than the blinking of 36 t h e f i r s t a d j u s t m e n t an eye or the jerking of a knee. Lay understandings of reflex theory allowed that malfunctions in internal organs affected the brain via the central nerves. For example, \"reflex theory\" frequently was invoked to explain mental illness in women whose brains had been affected by \"irritation\" of their reproductive organs, and Edward Shorter has noted this theory inspired doctors and patients to consent to many unnecessary gynecological surgeries.72 These rehabilitations of the doctrine of sympathies bring up an interesting point about nineteenth-century theories of bodily energies. They reflected the tacit belief that, just as nerves could conduct vitality, disruptions in nervous transmission \"transmitted\" states of injury from the central nervous system to bodily extremities. In this physiology, \"dysfunction\" practically functioned as a type of \"vital antimatter,\" the circulation of which imparted injury or illness in near-humoral fashion. From early on, vertebral vitalists read symptoms of osteopathology as signs of systemic bodily illness. The physical condition of the vertebrae became tangible evidence of the function of the nervous system, and by extension of complete bodily health. Poor posture, spinal deformities, and malformations of bones were perspicuous indications of \"spinal infirmity,\" which in turn was understood to reflect general physical debility. To be sure, many of these associations were reflective of health realities. Spinal deformations were more common in an age of corsets and endemic tuberculosis. Yet along with the tangible sequela of nineteenth-century public health issues, dominant medical ideologies contributed to popular interpretations of spinal disease. Popular physiologists understood spinal deformation as the result of various internal, environmental, and psychological stimuli, and they were quick to blame spinal problems on the bad habits and vices they sought to control. Among other factors, improper diet, poor hygiene, and the abuse of alcohol or tobacco led to internal \"morbidity.\" A colorful example is to be found in the rather common belief that masturbation led to curvature of the spine.73 In a paper originally published in 1835 in the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal, Samuel Bayard Woodward noted that \"self-abuse\" was recognizable by the victim's \"lolling or recumbent posture; and if at labor or at his games, [he] takes every opportunity to lie down or set in a bent or curved position.\"74 Over the next several decades, the campaign against \"solitary vice\" often published warnings like the following by William Earl: \"It is a remarkable fact, that the miserable victims of sexual excess, more especially those addicted to self-pollution (where the loss is greater and more frequent than in the natural act), are especially prone to Insanity; or if Reason maintain her tottering throne, it is only tha [sic] of decrepitude and premature loss of manly power. t h e f i r s t a d j u s t m e n t 37 'Excess of venery and the solitary vice of Onanism, excite MADNESS; they both effect the nervous system remarkably; they both stimulate the heart excessively; they both tend to gorge the brain and spinal cord; and they tend to render the individual MAD.' \"75 The solutions proposed for the correction of spinal problems reflected the \"neurocentric\" worldview of nineteenth-century medicine. John Scudder's prescribed treatments incorporated the range of eclectic therapeutics, including diuretic potash salts, sedatives, wet and dry cupping, botanic and mineral drugs, liniments, frictions, and both \"strengthening\" and \"irritating\" plasters applied directly to the spine.76 Health reformers often collapsed spinal therapeutics back into the general recommendations of hygienic living.77 In writing about spinal deformities among children, Wooster Beach revealed both the broad approach to treating spinal disease and the influence of health reform on pediatric care: \"Children at school, in consequence of sitting long in a bent position, are very liable to a curvature or bending of the spine. The remedy consists in avoiding the causes\u2014sitting in an erect position, exercising much in the open air, living on a light and principally vegetable diet, as bread and milk; bathing daily with cold water, keeping the bowels regular, and wearing a stimulating plaster on the spine, and avoid [sic] the use of mercury.\"78 Correct stimulation was a major element in popular treatments of spinal disease. Vertebral vitalists of many types claimed to repair the spine by removing unwanted pressures and other sources of irritation, or by providing needed stimulation in the form of \"counter-irritation.\" For example, neurasthenic authority George Beard cited \"counter-irritation\" as the mechanism by which hydropathy was effective, and he recommended water-cure treatments focus on the spine and back of the neck.79 Throughout the nineteenth century, touch-based therapies were regarded as a primary means of stimulating the spinal cord. American vertebral vitalists developed several modalities focusing on the transfer of vital healing energy from healer to patient. An explanation of massage by George Herbert Taylor provides an excellent example: \"The hands of the operator, or Masseur, are the instruments which transmit the mechanical energy emanating from his organism, and taking form in his muscles. This energy may be considered as producing the same or at least similar effects in the person receiving it, as would be experienced if it proceeded from his own muscles. The operator expends power; the patient receives it, to the same degree and in the same form. Energy is never lost; it is only transferred, and in the case it is also largely transformed; it merges into, and becomes an integral part of, processes occurring within the invalid's own organism.\"80 38 t h e f i r s t a d j u s t m e n t Like other remedies, however, manipulation of the vertebral column had a twofold effect. Spinal maintenance addressed problems originating in the back. Because the central nervous system was implicated in a series of comprehensive theories of disease, treatments also were assumed to affect the entirety of the central nervous system, and through it the whole human body. In those physiologies that assigned the spinal cord a sympathetic role in other illnesses, the spine became the nexus for healing. More accurately, the human spinal column had multiple healing epicenters, with different locations corresponding to various organs. To this end, popular physiologists even created treatment charts for common diseases. Sixty years before the discovery of chiropractic, proprietary healer Henry Hall Sherwood introduced a practice he, too, called \"nerve tracing.\"81 This consisted in following pain or pathology back to its root source of pressure on the foramen of the vertebrae. Sherwood published detailed diagrams of the central nervous system indicating the specific regions of the spine most in need of treatment. His schema was popularized by Wooster Beach, who reprinted both Sherwood's chart and several pages of his writing in Beach's 1847 Treatise on Anatomy.82 Spinal \"charting\" was found quite often in electrotherapeutics, a colorful facet of popular health culture that had a healthy patronage in Iowa at the turn of the century.83 In Dubuque, a physician name Nicolas Bray advertised his services as \"Master of Electro-Therapeutics,\" with his credentials reading, \"M.D., M.E.\"84 In 1912, in Cedar Rapids, a \"Mr. and Mrs. H. E. Hayden\" advertised \"The Hayden Method of Mechano-Spinology and Psycho-Therapy\" as a remedy for many common conditions, as well as \"any (so-called) Incurable Diseases.\"85 A year later in the same city, Dr. Berry S. Henderson promised both health and happiness through electrotherapeutics: \"If your body, which is really an electrical storage battery, does not properly perform its functions, nourish it, build it up with electricity, renewing that vital resistance which is the body's chief defense against disease\u2014and do it now when a little vitality destroyed means just little to be replaced.\"86 As late as 1923, Dr. H. Muller offered electrotherapeutic treatments in an office in the Davenport Savings Bank Building.87 Electrotherapeutics hit their stride in the late nineteenth century, when they were mainstays of both eclectic medicine and water cure. No less famous an irregular than John Scudder offered advice on the placement of electrodes on the spine.88 As electricity became a more popular curative, an explosion of electrical and galvanic devices occurred, with sumptuous offerings for patients to consume. One could drink E. E. Brewster's Medicated Electricity tonic, repose in a vibrating chair, wear an electromagnetic belt, or improve t h e f i r s t a d j u s t m e n t 39 a coiffure with an electromagnetic hairbrush.89 In contemporary popular culture, these gadgets are remembered as examples of the outlandishness of late-nineteenth-century popular health culture. In light of humorous depictions, it is important to note that electric treatments were taken quite seriously by many respected health reformers, most often for their \"nervauric\" potential. As late as 1911, massage proponent Louisa Despard accorded electrotherapeutics a legitimate place in her profession, noting \"Central galvanisation is the stimulation of the whole cerebro-spinal system, and is useful in cases of neurasthenia, insomnia, dyspepsia, etc.\"90 To be sure, practitioners applied electricity to other parts of the body, but the spine was among the most common sites for electrical treatment. Like other touch-based spinal treatments, the goal was to stimulate vitality in the spinal cord. t h e s p i r i t u a l i z at i o n o f s e c ta r i a n m e d i c i n e Chiropractic inherited a long tradition of beliefs and practices oriented to the spine. As a social movement, the emerging profession also recapitulated the logic and attitudes of its nineteenth-century predecessors. But perhaps most interesting, the chiropractic story captures another element of the history of alternative medicine: its consistent hospitability to a distinct spiritual outlook. In the last third of the nineteenth century, developments in the fields of bacteriology, embryology, and neuroscience caused a set of paradigm shifts away from knowledge that had been authoritative only a few decades earlier. The ascendance of germ theory after 1870 set orthodox and unorthodox healing on divergent paths, at the loss of a functioning lingua franca. For regular physicians, vitalism was a permissible casualty of advancements in science. Irregulars saw their preferred theorists fall by the wayside of the regular canon, and their systems became increasingly viewed as marginal modalities.91 In this changing cultural terrain, the medical alternatives that prospered tended to be framed as religions rather than medical treatments. In the late nineteenth century, spiritually oriented healing movements proliferated, including Holiness faith healing, Seventh-day Adventism, and many Metaphysical religions. It is not a coincidence that the decline of irregular medical systems such as eclecticism and homeopathy happened alongside a surge in alternative spiritualities. American spiritual healing owed much to preceding forms of irregular medicine. Healers in both Christian and Metaphysical healing movements embraced the \"conserved vital principle\" that was the foundation of health reform, and they often invested the life principle with divine cosmic power. 40 t h e f i r s t a d j u s t m e n t The process by which popular healing became more religiously oriented has been described by historian Rennie Schoepflin as a \"radical spiritualization.\" His banner example is Christian Science, where Mary Baker Eddy \"chose religion\" by making the conscious decision to adopt a religious model rather than that of an alternative medical system. Schoepflin found structural advantages for turn-of-the-century practitioners to act as spiritual healers so as to avoid prosecution in a more hostile climate of medical regulation.92 I would add that major conceptual shifts accompanied the structural changes Schoepflin has so perceptively identified. The shift in regard for vitalism also was an epistemological shift: a change in the paradigms for authoritative health knowledge and the social frameworks mediating it. It is counterintuitive to see the rise of spiritual healing as the \"religionization\" of knowledge previously in the domain of science, for \"secularization\" theories usually encourage the view that religious beliefs cede terrain to scientific facts. In alternative medicine, much seems to run in the opposite direction. As irregular medicine became overtly metaphysical, the vital principle was described more clearly as an occult or even divine power. Thus the Theosophist William Juvenal Colville cautioned his readers against base \"manipulative therapeutics\" which discounted the true nature of healing. He wrote, \"In our opinion it is not the act of manipulation, but a spiritual force going with it that accomplishes the cure.\"93 This change found its greatest expression in spiritual movements like Mental Healing, Christian Science, Mind Cure, and New Thought. As was the case with many vitalists historically, Progressive Era Metaphysicians envisioned matter and spirit as overlapping categories. They saw in this imbrication the possibility of accessing intangible realities for personal well-being. American Metaphysics established the body as a site for the realization of this cosmogony. One of its core characteristics was an emphasis on physical healing, which was seen as evidence of communion with the divine. Their healing logic relied on popular physiological ideas such as occult bodily forces and the status of the nervous system as a link between the mind and the body. These beliefs were deeply embedded in popular physiology. The Metaphysical systems shared a distinct vocabulary of \"body, mind, and spirit\" that reflected a common impulse aimed at reconfiguring the border between the material and immaterial. This language aimed to address the age-old philosophical problem of soul-body dualism, a central topic of Western metaphysics for millennia, which the American Metaphysics reconciled by presenting matter and spirit as both discrete and interchangeable entities. As early as the 1840s, some medical innovators argued for the cosmic significance of the vital principle. One such thinker was Joseph Rodes t h e f i r s t a d j u s t m e n t 41 Buchanan, an eclectic who understood vital force as the imminent manifestation of the \"Over-Soul\" of the universe. Buchanan believed that the \"soul of life\" was connected to the body via the central nervous system. \"When we understand clearly that life is located in the brain and its subordinate spinal and ganglionic structures, we may enquire whether it originates there, or comes by influx and is replenished from the limitless ocean of unembodied life which is invisible\u2014whether the Over-Soul of the universe does by any intelligible species of influx sustain and develop the life of individuals, which seems to be a fragment of the Divine nature\u2014will, wisdom and love.\"94 Buchanan transformed vitalist metaphysics into applied sciences, aimed at accessing the \"nervaura\" that linked all living creatures. A highly original philosophical idealist, he developed several systems, including \"Pneumatology,\" \"Psychometry,\" and \"Therapeutic Sarcognomy.\" Across these systems resonated the premise that physical touch could direct or transmit \"nervauric\" force. In the second half of the nineteenth century, spiritually creative A merican thinkers continued to invest the central nervous system with special religious significance. New Thought leader Warren Felt Evans wrote, \"The brain is extended through the whole body, by means of myriads of white cords or rays proceeding from the cerebro-spinal center, and interfused through all the living textures. So the soul-principle is co-extensive with it, and is everywhere in the organic structure.\"95 Evans made explicit recommendations about the importance of the spinal column: \"Nearly 300 muscles are directly or indirectly connected with the motions of which the small of the back is the pivotal centre. Persons who are strong, and whose muscular system is vigorous and well balanced, never complain of weakness here, while invalids will almost always be found to suffer from pain and weakness in this part of the body. The magnetism of the hand applied here is the efficient remedy in nature, especially when accompanied by the kneading and upward pressure of the abdomen. A large portion of chronic diseases are immediately relieved and ultimately cured by this simple treatment.\"96 Popular Metaphysicians like Evans affirmed the world was a transcendent manifestation of God. From this idea, it was not a great step to arrive at the belief that the human body was a corporeal expression of the divine. Evans articulated this point in language typical of American Metaphysical writing. \"But man is a microcosm, a world in himself, and his body sustains the same relation to the soul that the outward universe does to God. The body without the spirit is dead. Consequently it has no life of its own and in itself. Its vital force is derived from the all-pervading spirit. It is an effect of which the soul is the cause.\"97 42 t h e f i r s t a d j u s t m e n t In reading Progressive Era spiritual writers, it can be startling to find how strongly they drew on medically informed popular physiology. It is difficult to establish precisely the relationship between vitalist medical thought and Metaphysical philosophy. In many cases, what was preserved from medical vitalism was a broad perspective, newly spiritualized. In this sense, medical vitalism both contributed to and was indentured by the Metaphysical tradition, whose proponents applied a spiritual framework to medical etiology and therapeutics. American Metaphysicians held that the vital force was the physical expression of the power of God, which Warren Felt Evans described as, \"A hidden semi-spiritual principle that operates within the body of nature, which is the cause of all its visible phenomena. What we call causation is always unseen, at least it cannot be cognized by our senses only so far as it is ultimate in effects. The visible world is the region of effects; the unseen world is the realm of causes. The subtle essence to which we refer, is everywhere present and pervades all things, as the soul the body, and is the life of nature. It is the animus Mundo, the soul of the universe.\"98 Disease was caused by the excess, disruption, or deficiency of vital divine power, which Metaphysical thought saw in terms of the proper balance of the human soul.99 Ralph Waldo Trine's assertion that \"the real healing process must be performed by the operation of the life forces within\" was more than figurative.100 Often, innovators posited various types of \"spiritual matter.\"101 These imagined, rarified substances were thought to be part of the natural world, and were seen to follow fixed laws like those structuring the physical sciences.102 As was the case in popular physiology, American Metaphysics privileged the nervous system as an important conduit for life-giving forces. Harmonialism held that people were composites of three entities: body, mind, and spirit. The human mind was located in the brain, had a material core, and reflected the most fundamental aspects of an individual. At the same time, the mind was synonymous with a transcendent divine power, which alternately was identified as the human soul or the mind of God. The theory of mind thus reflected the intersection of spirituality with biology, as well as psychology and philosophy. Metaphysical thinkers were aware their healing philosophies partook of both science and religion. These discourses were blended in William Juvenal Colville's assertion, \"We place spirituality and morality in the foreground and teach a theology rather than materia medica. By a theology we mean a spiritual science, just as truly a science as geology is a science.' \"103 One can find direct evidence of vitalist medical theory in the writings of some Metaphysical healers. Andrew Jackson Davis, Warren Felt Evans, and other leaders cited many orthodox and irregular medical authorities. Davis, t h e f i r s t a d j u s t m e n t 43 a trained physician, was an especially strong advocate of sectarian medical reform. \"We glory in the development of 'Eclecticism.' It implies a vast scientific independence; a breaking up of the old mineral consolidations in medicine. It says: 'Investigate the laws of matter in man, rise above the historical horizon of physiological knowledge, think for yourself, yet read the works of Hahnemann, Dixon, Thompson, Bell, Muller, Hall, Hunter, Marshall, Bischoff, &c.; for in the fullness of human research and conclusions ye find the golden mean of common sense and medical prosperity.' \"104 The persistence of vitalist medical ideas in spiritual healing systems raises interesting questions about the interplay of science and religion. It suggests that in the Progressive Era the boundary between religion and science was by no means fixed, but rather was movable, permeable, and transgressed in both directions. In this time of scientific discovery, many Americans were still uncertain about how to demarcate the natural from the supernatural, and the sacred from the mundane. This was no less the case in previous eras, however. Historically, vitalism has proved hospitable terrain for both religious and scientific inquiries. The late-nineteenth-century \"spiritualization\" of vitalism was in some ways a restoration of metaphysical elements that had been downplayed in the European theories of the Enlightenment era. Prior to that, vitalist beliefs had enjoyed greater proximity to religious conceptions, especially Christian (both Protestant and Catholic) interpretations of the soul. Not only in the Victorian period, but more broadly, vitalist theories of biology are best understood as protean, aligning with either scientific or spiritual conceptions, with different historical moments encompassing processes of spiritualization or despiritualization. It is tempting to think of alternative medicine moving away from spirituality to become more \"scientific.\" This perspective comports with conventional expectations about scientific progress\u2014that is, the belief that knowledge habitually becomes more scientific and abandons religious belief as \"superstition.\" That the breakdown of the vitalist paradigm in regular medicine directed health reformers toward spiritual justifications upends all easy assumptions about \"secularization\" in modern life. Late-nineteenth-century vitalists were more than holdouts. In 1882 a surgeon named Elliot Coues gave an address at the Philosophical Society of Washington, D.C., in which he equated the vital force with the human soul. His speech is worth quoting at length: My view defines soul as the quantity of \"spirit\" which any living being may or does possess at any time. But this requires a definition of \"spirit,\" some quantity of which is to make a soul, just as some amount of matter 44 t h e f i r s t a d j u s t m e n t makes a body. I can attach no idea to the term \"spirit,\" from which all conceptions of matter are not absolutely excluded. Spirit is nothing if not immaterial. Force is likewise immaterial; but I think nearly all persons recognize a distinction between spirit and any mechanical force, such as gravitation. My mind affords no definition of spirit, if I may not call it self-conscious force. Self-conscious force being illimitable in time and space, and its sum being, in a word, infinite, I am unable to draw any distinction between spirit in its t otality and that Universal Mind, or Supreme Intelligence, which we mean when we speak or think of God. To my mind, \"mind in nature\" is a self-evident proposition\u2014a logical necessity. The simple fact that we can think a God, necessitates the conclusion most men have reached, of the existence in nature of other than what are called \"natural forces\"; of the reality of the existence of spirit as self-conscious force; though I do not see why it is not as \"natural\" a force as gravitation. It is certainly not unnatural; and to call it \"supernatural\" only exposes our ignorance of Nature\u2014Nature being, on any theistic hypothesis, simply the sum of the manifestations of the will of God.105 Deeply involved with Theosophy, Coues was one of several trained scientists who became involved with popular spiritual movements.106 His address was typical of a development in scientifically oriented popular philosophy: proposals reconciling scientific and religious concerns through redefinition of the categories of matter and spirit.107 Since touch was an essential element in spiritual healing, late-nineteenthcentury alternative healing harbored a real irony. The idealism of these traditions was communicated through bodily contact. The \"clairvoyant healer\" Andrew Jackson Davis exemplified this. The \"Poughkeepsie Seer\" blended psychical and spiritual therapeutics \"Movement Cure\" exercises and \"magnetic liniments.\"108 The spine figured centrally in his schema, and it was among the sites on the human body most amenable to magnetic treatments. Davis's treatments were strikingly physical and included forceful handling of patients' bodies, seen in his discussion of \"Sciatica Neuralgia\": \"The nerve-pain is principally owing to a sort of strangulation of the nerve itself. The life-principles of health and vigor cannot freely circulate through their appropriate conductors. Sciatic pain, or rheumatic neuralgia, is a common effect from such conditions. There is no quicker or shorter road to take to reach health conditions, than that of hand-friction and magnetization. The parts need to be rubbed vigorously, t h e f i r s t a d j u s t m e n t 45 and then manipulated, every day.\"109 As a \"Remedy for Weakness and Pain,\" Davis advised, \"This unbalanced condition between the sensory nerves and the nerves of motion, may be overcome by establishing an equal circulation of the magnetic energies between the brain and extremities. This equilibrium can be accomplished only by and through a persistent course of magnetic treatment. You should be pounded, rubbed, manipulated, and lastly, oiled from head to feet, at least once a day for many weeks.\"110 Therapeutic touch remained a mainstay of spiritual healing throughout the nineteenth century. Several decades later, a healer named Oliver Corwin Sabin reported on his treatment of a young woman. One day a young lady came to me to get me to treat a patient that she had charge of as a nurse, or caretaker, and wanted to know what hour they could come to see me, etc. After I had arranged the matter, I looked at her and I saw that she was pale and that her face was drawn with lines that indicated great pain and suffering. Said I, \"You look as though you need some help yourself.\" She said \"Yes,\" and added that she had been suffering ever since she was eleven years old from a severe pain in the lower part of her back and for years had not known one moment that she was free from pain. I told her that, if she would stand up, I would give her a treatment. She stood up and I took both of my hands and rubbed them from the base of the brain to the end of the spinal column, perhaps three minutes, stroking down, using the tips of my fingers. The pain stopped, the woman was healed, and never had another pain of that character, and in three months she grew rosy-cheeked, fleshy and healthy, and she has been so ever since, so far as I know.111 Sabin was a proponent of \"reformed Christian Science.\" While not affiliated with Mary Baker Eddy, he explained his ability to cure in acutely religious terms. The only gift I have that I ever noticed a difference in, between myself and my students, possibly is this gift of healing by the laying on of hands, and the only difference I see in this, is because the power manifested through me has been stronger than that of any student who has ever manifested it. But there are a number of them now that can heal through laying on of hands. A person suffering from what is termed pain is readily cured. I do not think I ever saw a pain that could not be destroyed that way very quickly. 46 t h e f i r s t a d j u s t m e n t This power of healing comes from God; it is of God; it belongs to man, but it is God working through man. Some people call it e lectricity, others will tell you that it is magnetism, but they do not know.112 Like many of his contemporaries, Sabin invoked the Christian notion of \"laying on of hands\" as a description of his treatment. This was a common trope among American Metaphysicians, and it was not confined to those who identified with Christianity per se. There is an obvious reason for the use of this biblical metaphor. The \"laying on of hands\" was an accessible image for read hristian ers. But this did not mean Metaphysical healers were preserving C beliefs. They often tilted with dominant religious institutions by exposing the aridness of their doctrines. Like some modern chiropractors, they reworked traditional Christian ideas into a distinct metaphysics that was in many respects actually hostile to formal Christianity. Sabin developed a theory he called \"Christology.\" It attributed healing to \"celestial harmony through Divinity's etheric vibrations.\"113 His \"vibratory treatment\" was representative of many healing philosophies at the turn of the century. \"Christology\" maintained a proximity to other forms of Metaphysical vitalism, but equated the vital principle with the power of God. Sabin is especially relevant to chiropractic history, for D. D. Palmer endorsed his ideas in a 1904 edition of his newspaper, The Chiropractor.114 Chiropractic resonated\u2014intentionally\u2014with beliefs and practices that were widespread in the culture of its origin. Now that I have sketched the remarkable cultural milieu from which chiropractic emerged, the following chapters will explore how chiropractic \"pioneers\" preserved and adapted nineteenth-century beliefs and values in a quickly changing world. the beginning of chiropractic philosophy Told through the life of its founders, the history of the chiropractic movement sheds light on the culture of alternative medicine and spirituality. The Palmers exemplified a type of self-promoter who amalgamated spiritual ideas with personal ambitions. Their story summons the interpersonal tensions and conflicts that stand in the background of so many biographies. The Palmers were creative, independent thinkers who saw themselves as greatly at odds with their society. Chiropractic would not have succeeded without them, but the individualism that rendered the Palmers so effective as popular medical innovators made them ill-equipped for collaboration. Both D. D. Palmer and B. J. Palmer lost positions of influence in the chiropractic movement, and when this happened, they each built ever more elaborate chiropractic t h e f i r s t a d j u s t m e n t 47 theories, which closed the gaps between the physical and spiritual worlds, mind and body, science and religion, and the human and divine. In this sense, the Palmers' intellectual biographies correspond to the \"radical spiritualization\" seen more broadly in American alternative medicine. The Palmers came to believe they had discovered a completely new way of understanding biology: relating physiological processes to the forces of the cosmos. The cosmic and therapeutic came together in their understanding of \"Chiropractic Philosophy,\" a comprehensive theory about the nature of reality. Chiropractic Philosophy entailed a tripartite understanding of the universe. At the top was a \"Universal Intelligence,\" which D. D. Palmer equated with God. Universal Intelligence was manifested individually, so that Innate Intelligence was a \"personified portion of The All Wise\u2014the sum total of which is God.\"115 Innate Intelligence exercised dominion over the body, and thus presided over Educated Intelligence (the conscious mind), as well as multiple vital forces. This philosophy linked the physical practice of chiropractic to a greater spiritual worldview. In 1899 D. D. Palmer wrote, \"We are living in an age of wonders. Every day we are surprised at some new invention.\"116 His observation must have resonated with his countrymen, for whom, in many ways, the Progressive Era was a \"wonderful\" time. In many dimensions of American life, outlines of the twentieth-century experience were being drawn. Railroads shortened distances, so that cross-country travel took only days. Telephones, indoor plumbing, gas and electric lights, and urban rapid transit systems connected the lived experience of the Progressive Era world to the present day. For the Americans encountering them, though, these changes were felt to be altering the fabric of American society in ways that ushered in a pervasive \"psychic turbulence.\"117 For this reason the Progressive Era often has been characterized as a time of both \"optimism\" and \"anxiety.\"118 It was the period of the rise of corporate capitalism, modern financial markets, mass production of goods, and the development of a large-scale consumer culture. In truth, there was a great deal to be anxious about: economic uncertainty, racial and ethnic tension, labor unrest, political factionalism, and religious schism. Dramatic cycles of growth and depression left many Americans painfully aware of the capriciousness of the new economic order. Many people felt as if the deck were stacked against them, for a person's own economy could boom and bust, sometimes repeatedly over the course of a lifetime\u2014as was the case with D. D. Palmer. Furthermore, in the Progressive Era the exchange of ideas became both more and less free. On the one hand, mechanization made printing cheaper. Very few self-published writers got rich, but small-scale fame was within 48 t h e f i r s t a d j u s t m e n t reach. Because print culture became the preeminent vehicle for radicalism, however, it became the primary target for social control. Under the 1874 Comstock Laws that suppressed \"obscene\" literature sent through the U.S. Mail, hundreds of Americans went to prison for publishing their views on sexuality and religion. If the Progressive Era was a time of high costs and rather low rewards for writing, one wonders why so many Americans almost doggedly persisted. I think it points to something characteristic about the period: people really believed that ideas could change the world. More than simple optimism, populist writers saw their projects as ways to bring forth great and dramatic change for humanity. This sentiment stands behind the Palmers' project, too, and helps account for their awe-inspiring transformation of chiropractic into a template for ultimate reality. In the second half of the nineteenth century, the conflict between science and religion took on new urgency. Certain aspects of the growing divide, such as the fights over Darwinism and Biblical inerrancy, are well known in American cultural history. Beyond these prominent issues, however, stood a highly variegated terrain where remarkable numbers of people brought science and religion together in personal reinterpretations of the world. The Palmers' creation of chiropractic puts this impulse into sharp relief. Their theories went through several renditions, but nearly all of them maintained that the key to health was the proper flow of a cosmically endowed bodily force expressed in the brain and spinal column (the \"Innate Intelligence\"). In the Palmers' cosmology, Innate was the link between both body and mind, and the human being to the divine. Innate is a part of the Creator. Innate is the Creator of man before as well as after birth. Mother Innate builds before birth\u2014the individualized, personified Innate after birth. Innate is a part of The All Wise. Innate (Spirit) is a part of Universal Intelligence, individualized and personified. Innate desires to assist the Chiropractor in m aking a correct diagnosis. The Universal Intelligence, collectively or individualized, desires to express itself in the best manner possible. It has been struggling for countless ages to improve upon itself\u2014to express itself intellectually and physically higher in the scale of evolution. Man's aspirations should be to advance to a superior level, to make himself better, physically, mentally, and spiritually. This marvelous existence of many systems, harmoniously associated and controlled by the I AM, constitutes the duality of man. The spirit was a living intelligence before it was united with the body. It will continue a living, intelligent entity after it is separated from it.119 t h e f i r s t a d j u s t m e n t 49 Passages like this one, which appear often in the writings of both men, are telling signs of the Palmers' participation in the tradition of alternative spirituality. While interpretations may differ, there is a rough consensus among historians on certain points about the Metaphysical worldview. \"Harmonials\" interpreted God differently than \"orthodox\" Christians. The personal \"God\" of Western monotheism was transmuted into renditions reflecting many spiritual subcultures: the \"Cosmic Consciousness,\" or \"the presuppositions about the nature of reality also undergirded Metaphysical thought. The material world was illusory\u2014a superficial manifestation of the more \"real\" spiritual realm. Metaphysical thought drew from many sets of ideas from both Western and Eastern philosophy, but Swedenborgian influences were especially strong. The material was seen as standing in unique relation to the spiritual; they were corresponding. American metaphysicians imposed the same model on their understanding of the relationship between human beings and the divine: consciousness was coextensive with the mind of God. The strains of American Metaphysics were \"applied theologies\"\u2014spiritual suppositions whose effects were intended to be felt in lived experience. Physical healing was a primary focus of Metaphysical spirituality, as were financial success, emotional well-being, and social empowerment. Interpreting individual human consciousness as a microcosmic expression of Divine Mind created certain possibilities for believers. The human mind became a powerful instrument through which one could connect to greater powers. Correct thinking, whether in the form of mental practices or ideas to embrace, offered techniques for aligning an individual human mind with the higher divine power. Because Metaphysically oriented Americans believed in a world that was \"charged with the grandeur of God,\" they questioned dominant conceptions of natural and supernatural, subjective and objective, and human and divine. Metaphysical movements typically proposed redefining the contours of the natural world to accommodate the \"supra-natural\" instead of the \"supernatural.\" The distinction they hoped to capture was that the phenomena were part of the natural world, but were beyond the mundane capacities of human apprehension. Popular Metaphysics thus reverberated with the impulse to expand the boundaries of reality even while preserving the integrity of scientific laws. Overall, American Metaphysics was positive toward modern science. It was common for writers to assert that science and religion need not be at odds, but could support one another. They roundly rejected the supernatural, as conventionally described in folklore and dismissed by modern thinkers as 50 t h e f i r s t a d j u s t m e n t superstition. At the same time, Harmonials were flexible about the boundaries of the science they championed. They insisted that reality encompassed more than what one could perceive with normal sensory experience. Spirit phenomena, vital forces, the \"ether\" energy that animated the universe\u2014all were part of the supra-natural. By this the users of the term stressed the reality-as-fact nature of the occult forces and phenomena underlying the universe. The use of scientific paradigms points to how the Metaphysical orientation strongly engaged the intellect. Resonant of Troeltsch's assessment of Spiritual Religion, Harmonial thinkers upheld knowledge as the appropriate, modern way to interact with the divine. Thus the Transcendentalist writer Theodore Parker was able to write, In most various ways men may enlarge the power to communicate with God; complete and normal life is the universal instrument thereof. Here is a geologist chipping the stones, or studying the earthquake-waves; here is a metaphysician chipping the human mind, studying its curious laws,\u2014 psychology, logic, ontology; here is a merchant, a mechanic, a poet, each diligently using his intellectual gift; and as they acquire the power to think, by so much more do they hold intellectual communion with the thought of God,\u2014their finite mind communing with the Infinite. My active power of understanding, imagination, reason, is the measure of my intellectual communion with him.120 For Parker, in lieu of prayer, doctrine, ritual, or any other conventional religious approach, \"Investigation\" held the key to authentic religious encounter. In this light, the Palmers' \"discovery\" of chiropractic takes on additional meaning. The Metaphysical tradition\u2014and we can include chiropractic in that greater stream\u2014was the site where all the themes of popular intellectualism converged most dramatically: individuals studied so as to ascertain knowledge about ultimate truths, on which they could base independent theories of reality. It is not too early in this text to point out how often D. D. and B. J. Palmer each proclaimed to have discovered \"the secret to Life itself!\" The degree to which the Palmers incorporated Metaphysical spirituality into chiropractic theory is a little-known fact. How and why they did this, and the degree to which the spiritual impulse was contained by others in the emerging chiropractic profession, poses an interesting set of questions and highlights the relevance of the chiropractic story to a broader understanding of American religion and culture. Max Weber only briefly discussed the \"self-taught intelligentsia of the disprivileged classes,\" whom he saw as tending to be unusually receptive to new religious and moral views.121 It is not difficult to imagine the people t h e f i r s t a d j u s t m e n t 51 he had in mind: intelligent, ambitious figures who, due to socioeconomic circumstances, are somehow outside the rationalized channels for personal self-realization and advancement. Weber believed that circumscribed opportunities in the \"world\" afforded the advantage of intense spiritual creativity: \"Since these groups are not bound by the social conventions, they are capable of an original attitude toward the meaning of the cosmos; and since they are not impeded by any material considerations, they are capable of intense ethical and religious emotion.\"122 Many health reformers, including botanic medical developer Samuel Thomson, dietary reformer Sylvester Graham, and osteopath Andrew Taylor Still, had humble origins and were largely selftaught. Their biographies form narratives of seemingly single-handed rises to great heights. More importantly, their ideas all encompassed, to varying degrees, both health systems and entire cosmologies, suggesting that each saw himself as the recipient of a world-changing revelation. The Palmers' biographies show an elective affinity between a certain personality and a particular set of ideas persistent in Spiritual Religion. The chiropractic story shows just how detached Spiritual Religion can be from institutional Christianity. In some respects, however, chiropractic shows continuities with a long tradition of religious dissent. Straight chiropractic might even be understood as a distant relation of radical Protestantism's \"priesthood of all believers.\" The Palmers' use of Metaphysical ideas is one of several reasons I, as a religionist, take up the \"Religion of Chiropractic.\" For a small but vocal contingent within the profession, chiropractic continues to be not only a health practice but a full, systematic theology. \"Super Straight\" chiropractors, a faction in the contemporary profession, adhere to the Palmers' most spiritual interpretations, arguing, in effect, that the practice affects the circulation of divine power\u2014\"God force\"\u2014in the human body. While the Metaphysical dimensions of chiropractic are represented by a minority of contemporary chiropractors, additional insights from religious studies help in understanding chiropractic. Even mainstream chiropractic often is \"sectarian\" in its ideas and social organization. Its theories are highly controversial, with both proponents and detractors assuming positions of \"true believers.\" As a religionist, I am interested in applying the perspective of \"structured empathy\" to the interpretation of competing truth claims. I have aspired to portray the Palmers humanely, but not hagiographically, for I believe it is important not to erase their very human frailties. As the rest of this \"chiropractic story\" will make clear, there is no way to hide the Palmers' strangeness and remain intellectually honest. 52 t h e f i r s t a d j u s t m e n t chapter two a m a g n e t i c h e a l e r i n i o wa One finds, in vital magnetism, the key of the scientific magic of the future, which reveals all secrets of the creative spirit. \u2014Paschal Beverly Randolph, Sexual Magic \" f o x y g r a n d pa\" \"Foxy Grandpa\" was a self-given nickname D. D. Palmer used in later life. It was an appropriate sobriquet. D. D. was a shrewd man who seldom missed an opportunity for personal profit. His erratic behavior prompted those around him to question his sanity. Even so, one is led to wonder whether D. D. wasn't \"crazy like a fox.\" Daniel David Palmer was of humble origins, born in Ontario in 1845, the oldest of six children.1 His father held a variety of jobs, including shoemaker, grocer, and postmaster of Port Perry. D. D. appears to have attended school for only four years and began working at the age of eleven. Despite his own limited education, one of D. D.'s first jobs was as a teacher. In 1865, D. D. and his brother Thomas Palmer immigrated to the United States. Thomas went to Oklahoma, and D. D. settled in New Boston, Illinois, a small town on the Mississippi River. From 1866 to 1871, D. D. taught grade school in Illinois and Iowa.2 This was not a prestigious occupation. At the time, village schoolteachers earned considerably less than hired farmhands.3 We know D. D. aspired to greater things, however, from his journal, which he started in New Boston and kept sporadically for more than 20 years. While much of this \"diary\" is blank, the opening pages express some of the personal traits that would direct his future. D. D.'s list of \"Mottoes\" not only presage his later use of aphorisms, the sayings recorded here convey values and perspectives that came to full fruition in his later life.4 For example, several of D. D.'s \"Mottoes\" encouraged industriousness in all endeavors: \"I will try. I am [sic] idle. Dare to do right\"; 53 \"Excelsio[r] higher and higher; but only step by step\"; \"Study first, play afterwards. Truth always\"; and \"Study hours. Find a way or make a way.\" These statements point to D. D.'s commitment to \"improving\" himself through study and self-discipline. In nineteenth-century Middle America, learning was highly valued. As the American economic system went through several stages of economic development, from the emergence of a market economy through the swell of changes associated with the Industrial Revolution, one continuity was the psychic response of some men and women, for whom personal industry and knowledge promised financial security in an aleatory world. Learning also was the key to social enfranchisement. Education could make a person \"respectable,\" a quality that connoted moral fitness and social standing.5 Education was also a form of entertainment, a means of satisfying one's curiosity about the world, and a vehicle for self-actualization. People like D. D. needed little external prompting to read and learn. They approached their self-study projects with a spirit of intellectual independence. From other sources, we know D. D. Palmer to have been a \"Freethinker\" who disdained institutional Christianity in favor of religious alternatives. In the \"Mottoes,\" one sees the beginnings of a layered complexity regarding religion. In keeping with his generally \"Deist\" outlook, several aphorisms carried images from nature: \"Good nature attracts honey from every herb; ill nature sucks poison from the sweetest flowers\"; \"Use a book as a bee does a flower\"; and \"Little deeds are like little seeds\u2014they grow to flowers and weeds.\" Yet other passages resonate with Judeo-Christian monotheism: \"He who obeys God's laws finds him a father; He who disobeys finds him a judge.\" While the Journal may be a poor indicator of D. D.'s precise beliefs about religion, it says more about his views on moral conduct, which were decidedly realistic: \"The mill cannot grind with the water that is past.\" Considering what one knows about D. D.'s irascible temperament, he may have been too self-forgiving when he wrote, \"He who does the best he can, does well: acts nobly: angels could not do more.\" He seems, however, to have applied this realism to his dealings with others. Several notes about teaching school reflect his rough practicality: Let pupils criticize each other in classes. Use persuasion to get large boys to quit using tobacco. Whip giving time between the strokes. Never tell a child what he or she can discover for itself. Do not sit large boys and girls near each other. Stepping back from the list of \"Mottoes,\" one gets an early portrait of the man. D. D. was a populist intellectual\u2014knowledgeable but somewhat 54 a m a g n e t i c h e a l e r i n i o w a Daniel David (D. D.) Palmer, ca. 1905. Archives, David D. Palmer Health Sciences Library/Palmer College of Chiropractic. uncultured, ambitious but without a clear direction for the future. He was common, both in social position and philosophical perspective. He was \"common\" in a third sense, too, in that his type was a regular feature on the American cultural landscape. D. D. was a traveler, on roadways and in relationships. Over the course of his life, he married five times, first in January 1871 to a woman named Abba Lord. Later that year, the couple bought two plots of land near New Boston. It is likely the marriage ended in divorce, because Abba Palmer sold her share of the farm in 1873. D. D. and his first wife reportedly had two children, but their daughter died in infancy, and it is not clear Abba was the mother of D. D.'s son, Frank Palmer, who died before reaching adulthood.6 D. D. remarried a year later, to Louvenia Landers, who may have been Frank Palmer's mother. Into the 1880s, D. D. mostly made his living as a small businessman, at various points cultivating raspberry plants and bees, operating a grocery store, and selling patent medicines.7 One of his early business ventures was peddling goldfish out of a wheelbarrow he pushed through the streets of a m a g n e t i c h e a l e r i n i o w a 55 town\u2014an act which contributed to his reputation as a local oddity. A creative, eclectic spirit drove D. D.'s intellectual interests as well. Like many Americans, he was drawn to spiritualism, to which he maintained a lifelong commitment. By 1880, he was using his raspberry catalogs to proclaim his belief in spiritualism, already showing a propensity to mingle commerce and religion.8 Long before becoming a healer, D. D. seems to have distrusted medical authorities. In the journal, he noted that, \"The best physicians are Dr. Diet, Dr. Quiet, and Dr. Merryman.\" In 1881, after selling the New Boston farm, D. D. and Louvenia Palmer moved to What Cheer, Iowa, where D. D.'s brother Thomas Palmer was living. Louvenia died in 1884, leaving D. D. with three more children: daughters May and Jessie and his son Joshua Bartlett (born in 1882 and known to all as \"B. J.\").9 The following year, D. D. wed a third time, to Martha A. Henning.10 This marriage coincided with a new career. In 1885 or 1886, he opened a magnetic healing practice in Burlington, 30 miles northeast of New Boston.11 Burlington's status as a port made it one of the largest towns in Iowa. With a population of more than 20,000 people, the town promised economic opportunities. All the same, one might wonder how D. D. expected to make a go of it in his new \"profession.\" The risks and potentials he courted are made evident by considering the broader experience of magnetic healers, historically and in D. D.'s own time period. tracing magnetic healing If you were to seek out a \"magnetic cure\" in the late nineteenth century, it is likely you would not be treated with magnets, but rather would receive a type of body work\u2014what people in the present day would describe as a \"touchbased therapy.\" It would be justified by a therapeutic logic both patient and healer would recognize. Going back centuries, \"magnetic healing\" has meant many things and encompassed several types of folk healing practices. \"Magnetism\" originally referred to the European and early American folk practice of applying magnets to the skin. The capacity of magnets to \"draw\" metal inspired generations of lay healers to use them to remove illness, because disease often was understood as blockages or disruptions within the body that one might physically pull away. Over time, practitioners came to see magnetic power as separate from magnets themselves. Some of the famous magnetists used instruments made of metal or even wood to rechannel bodily forces.12 In Europe in the late eighteenth century, magnetic healing was systematized and refined by a controversial Viennese doctor named Franz Anton 56 a m a g n e t i c h e a l e r i n i o w a Mesmer, who is regarded as the preeminent developer of nineteenth-century magnetism.13 Mesmer believed the \"magnetic fluid\" of the human body was actually an indwelling manifestation of cosmic, \"etherial [sic] matter.\" Mesmer is remembered for his idea of transferral of power from the magnet to the magnetizer, or mesmerist. He named this force \"animal magnetism,\" and convoluted it with the electrical activity of the nervous system. Mesmer developed a system whereby, first with magnets then without, a healer could direct the flow of vital \"magnetic fluid\" in order to effect a cure. His system maintained that any blockage to the flow of this fluid was detrimental to health. To a great degree, Mesmer's ideas did not depart from conventional scientific wisdom, but reinforced it. Like Enlightenment-era vitalist medical theorists, Mesmer posited that a special \"force\" animated the body; health depended on the unobstructed flow or activity of this principle, and illness resulted when it was blocked or depleted. His philosophy was embedded, however, in the folkloric practice of physically handling human patients. Mesmer gave the following directions for properly \"magnetizing\" someone sick. First of all, one must place oneself opposite the patient, back to the north, bringing one's feet against the invalid's then lay one's two thumbs lightly on the nerve plexes which are located at the pit of the stomach, and the fingers on the hypochondria [the region beneath the ribs]. From time to time it is good to run one's fingers over the ribs, principally towards the spleen, and to change the position of the thumbs. After having continued this exercise for about a quarter of an hour, one performs in a different manner, corresponding to the condition of the patient. For example, if it is a disorder of the eyes, one lays the left hand on the right temple. One then opens the eyes of the patient and brings one's thumbs very close to them. Then the thumbs are run from the root of the nose (bridge) all around the socket. If one has to deal with a violent headache, the tip of one thumb is brought to the forehead, the other behind the head opposite to it. The same thing applies to all pains which are experienced in other parts of the body. It is always necessary that one hand is on one side, and the other hand is on the opposite side. If the sickness is general, the hands\u2014made into a pyramid with the fingers\u2014are passed over the whole body, starting at the head and then descending along the two shoulders down to the feet. After this one returns to the head: from the front and from the rear, then over the abdomen and over the back.14 a m a g n e t i c h e a l e r i n i o w a 57 The proximity of mesmerism to folk healing was one reason the practice was controversial. Another was the widespread concern that Mesmer himself was an opportunistic charlatan. Anton Mesmer grew famous tendering his services to members of the upper class, first in Vienna and then Paris, and he gained notoriety for staging public demonstrations of his \"baquet,\" a wooden bathtub with paddles that was designed to heal many patients at once. John Grieve, a British physician, observed the practice in 1784: In the middle of the room is placed a vessel of about a foot and a half high which is called here a \"baquet.\" It is so large that twenty people can easily sit round it; near the edge of the lid which covers it, there are holes pierced corresponding to the number of persons who are to surround it; into these holes are introduced iron rods, bent at right angles outwards, and of different heights, so as to answer to the part of the body to which they are to be applied. Besides these rods, there is a rope which communicates between the baquet and one of the patients, and from him is carried to another, and so on the whole round. The most sensible effects are produced on the approach of Mesmer, who is said to convey the fluid by certain motions of his hands or eyes, without touching the person. I have talked with several who have witnessed these effects, who have convulsions occasioned and removed by a movement of the hand.15 The same year Dr. Grieve recorded his observations, the French Royal Academy of Sciences investigated Mesmer's claims. The commission, whose participants included Benjamin Franklin, rejected his discoveries.16 Discredited in Paris, Mesmer returned to Vienna. In the following decades his departure was replicated by many magnetists who often were marginal, flyby-night figures. Mesmeric practitioners always seemed to operate on the fringes of propriety, respectability, and legality. Yet their suspect identities could not dispel their popularity. While the report by the Royal Academy discredited Mesmer personally in Europe, its wide circulation in the United States sparked an American interest in Mesmerism that endured through much of the nineteenth century.17 Mesmerism entered American culture in ways consistent with popular intellectualism. Reports on \"animal magnetism\" soon became a steady feature in vernacular print culture. Patrons became acquainted with the practice through demonstrations at lyceums, forums that served both as serious 58 a m a g n e t i c h e a l e r i n i o w a educational venues and opportunities for public amusement. Mesmerists self-published their lectures and advertised their services in newspapers and magazines of every stripe. In this way, magnetic healing entered the broader discourse of popular physiology, and it soon was promoted by health reformers like Orson Squire Fowler, a prominent phrenologist and \"watercure\" physician. Support for magnetism was especially strong among eclectic physicians, who took the lead in promulgating French vitalism as well.18 There was a symbiotic relationship between magnetic healers and the greater health reform world. Magnetic healers drew on popular physiology to justify their practice, while greater health reformers saw in magnetic healing a full expression of the vitalist therapeutic directive. Even as magnetism aligned with nineteenth-century health reform, it never shook its fly-by-night element. Regular physicians and other skeptics wrote warnings to the general public against the fraudulence of magnetic healers. Despite, and perhaps because of such criticism from the \"establishment,\" however, magnetism appealed to populist intellectuals, many of whom were seeking relief from what they regarded as oppressive medical authorities. The harangues of regular doctors seemed to generate interest in the practice as well as quell it. For much of the general public, magnetism lost its cachet by the late nineteenth century. Changing scientific paradigms led many Americans to regard the practice as an effete parlor game. More so than in earlier decades, magnetism was seen as socially and scientifically deviant. Practitioners were criticized in much of the press as \"rubbers\" of the basest type, but magnetic healing continued to be a feature on public lecture circuits, and it retained a smaller but entrenched presence on the terrain of American health culture. Across America it was not unusual for small towns to harbor several such practitioners, who were patronized into the first decades of the twentieth century. To understand magnetists' enduring appeal, one might consider the subjective experience of the patients who made up their clientele. The story of one Iowa woman is revealing on this point. Emily Hawley Gillespie was already an invalid, suffering from a \"growing paralysis,\" when in April 1887 she received several treatments from \"Dr. Munson of Maquoketa.\" She hoped he would help her walk again, and in her diary wrote that she thought the treatments were doing some good. \"What can I say? take[n] all together I think I am improving. [C]an use my feet to r[o]ck my chair\u2014which I believe I could not do since last summer. Dr M.\u2014\u2014says I will be healthier and stronger than I ever was, like a girl of sixteen. I can hardly comprehend that it is so, for all my a m a g n e t i c h e a l e r i n i o w a 59 life has been so frail. [I]t seems too that my hair is not as white. [I]t is like bringing the dead back to earthly life.\"19 For patients like Gillespie, who already had patronized regular physicians with few positive results, magnetism promised a healing experience that mainstream medicine had not delivered. Proponents of magnetic healing had, historically, emulated and also tilted with mainstream science and medicine. As the biomedical sciences changed with the rise of laboratory-based biology, the discovery of germ theory, new knowledge in neurology, and a shift away from vitalism, it is perhaps not surprising that magnetic healing adjusted so as to both incorporate and challenge new discoveries. In the Progressive Era, Mesmer was still praised as a misunderstood pioneer.20 But writers often presented magnetic healing as a system that had changed and developed, becoming more scientifically sophisticated. Few magnetic healers held to the belief that the nerves were \"tiny tubes\" conveying an ethereal magnetic fluid, as Mesmer and many other eighteenth century physiologists had proposed. Rather, they endorsed the later concept of \"nerve force\" in a style similar to other physiological thinkers, and they distinguished their practice by the refined name, \"Vital Magnetism.\" This term seems to have first appeared in British sources in the 1840s.21 Thirty years later, vital magnetism had become a known entity for the American lay health subculture. The emergence of vital-magnetic discourse points to two related but different phenomena. On the one hand, vital magnetism was a \"repackaging\" of mesmerism, updated to incorporate popular health ideas about vitalism, the nervous system, the spine, and touch. At the same time, the treatment was popularized by both medical sectarians and spiritual reformers, who saw in magnetism the realization of their own beliefs about the body, mind and spirit. The directions taken by late-nineteenth-century magnetic theorists show the paradox seen more broadly in alternative health culture. Their engagement with sophisticated scientific and metaphysical spiritual ideas both were heightened. While little documentation exists of D. D. Palmer's life before chiropractic, one useful resource speaks to both the meaning of \"vital magnetism\" in American popular health culture and D. D.'s particular understanding of magnetic healing. The \"Portable Library\" (or \"Traveling Library\") is an odd collection of books and pamphlets known to be in D. D.'s possession for much of his life. D. D.'s notes among the pages date at least part of the collection to his time in New Boston and What Cheer. At some point, he had the 15 texts bound into a single volume, which he carried with him even when he traveled, as he did considerably in his later years. 60 a m a g n e t i c h e a l e r i n i o w a Several of the texts identify D. D. as a supporter of the Freethought movement. Two were by the scientist William Denton, whose family published the Freethought newspaper The Vanguard. In addition, the Portable Library contained multiple books on human sexuality, a subject associated with Freethinkers. These included a copy of the extremely controversial Cupid's Yokes by Ezra H. Heywood, which triggered a famous obscenity trial of its authors under the Comstock Laws. Six items in the collection were on magnetic healing, and the five authors of these sources use similar terminology, cite common authorities, and reference one another. In D. D.'s vital-magnetic sources, as in popular health literature more generally, the nervous system often was convoluted with natural phenomena, like electricity. The magnetic writers referenced new technologies in creating vivid metaphors, such as those seen in a description of nerve functioning from Full and Comprehensive Instructions\u2014How to Mesmerize, by J. W. Cadwell: \"The brain is the telephone office though which we give and receive impressions. The ear is the instrument and the auditory nerves are the wires that bear the spoken messages to the master of this tenement of clay. If the dispatch that is sent over those wires, or nerves, is sufficiently impressive, the recipient will experience the same sensation as though a real violin was being played within hearing, and the spirit will act, or cause the body to act in harmony with that sensation.\"22 Despite their metaphorical appropriations of new technologies, modern science presented problems for magnetists, who were pressed to justify their practice against discoveries in neurology and medicine. E. D. Babbitt's book, Vital Magnetism, the Life Fountain, illustrates the challenges popular vitalists faced in preserving their paradigm.23 Babbitt's work, which also was included in the Portable Library, was a retort against the theories of Charles-\u00c9douard Brown-S\u00e9quard, the neurologist who had isolated the nerves' transmission of different types of information through opposing sides of the spinal cord. Brown-S\u00e9quard's new physiological models undermined the older ideas of nerve-force on which magnetic healing was based. Along with newly sophisticated neurology, magnetic healers were challenged by other medical developments, of which germ theory was perhaps the most major. Vital magnetism, like other vitalist systems of this period, attributed disease to disruptions in the life principle. For example, the excessive accumulation of a magnetic aura could cause inflammation and sickness.24 Becoming aware of theories of contagion, vital magnetists sometimes posited that the magnetic principle could be a vector for contagious disease. Thus Juliet H. Severance endorsed magnetism but cautioned against its power to transmit morbid influences.25 a m a g n e t i c h e a l e r i n i o w a 61 Three of Severance's books are in the Portable Library, and together they show the range of her interests. Dubbed the \"Woodhall of Wisconsin\" by her fans, Juliet Severance was active in several reform movements, including temperance, women's rights, and labor, but it is her spiritual ideas that are most relevant here.26 On the lecture circuit, Severance advocated not only magnetic healing, but also spiritualism and a \"theory of correspondences\" that was Swedenborgian in orientation.27 Her engagement with Metaphysical culture raises an important point about magnetic healing: it had a strong spiritual edge that became sharper in the late nineteenth century. Other Portable Library writers also convoluted spiritual and magnetic forces, and presented the vital magnetic force as a manifestation of ultimate reality. E. D. Babbitt captured this spiritualization when he wrote, \"Every human being combines both vital magnetism and vital electricity, which constitute the life-aura. This is the connecting link between soul and body, the medium through which the mind thinks in connection with the brain, and the v ivifying principle of both adwell portrayed the voluntary and involuntary forces.\"28 Similarly, J. W. C the nervous system as the communicator of the external world to the human soul.29 Such understandings of the vital magnetic principle reflected the metaphysical orientation of popular science and health. In the nineteenth century, both professional scientists and lay thinkers gravitated to the notion that the world was held together by a substance too fine to detect by mundane means, but real nonetheless. The idea of \"spiritual matter\"\u2014physical but lighter and more subtle than air\u2014stood behind the many \"ether theories\" found in nineteenth-century metaphysics. Because magnetism fit into popular understandings of science, the practice often was incorporated into other cultural fads, like spiritualism, phrenology, hypnosis, and psychic science.30 Like these movements, vital magnetic healing proposed the existence of invisible energies circulating through the universe, responsible for both seen and unseen phenomena. This perspective is seen most dramatically in Psychometry and Thought-Transference, with Practical Hints for Experiments, perhaps the most unusual text in the Portable Library.31 The writer, N. C., is known only by his initials, but in the introduction by Henry Steele Olcott he is identified as a \"Medical Theosophist.\" Along with several other Portable Library writers, N. C. cited the theories of the prominent eclectic physician Joseph Rodes Buchanan and the esoteric German vitalist, Baron von Reichenbach. In presenting the magnetic force as a manifestation of ultimate reality, these thinkers saw in vital magnetism a full \"cosmogony.\"32 62 a m a g n e t i c h e a l e r i n i o w a In Psychometry and Thought-Transference, N. C. promoted \"ether theory,\" presented as the idea of a rarified medium through which telepathic and magnetic vibrations could travel. \"The fundamental basis of all occult science is that there is but one essence, and that all things\u2014concrete matter in its various manifestations, force, thought, and what is called spirit\u2014are but different forms of this cosmic matter, the difference consisting in the distance separating the molecules and in their arrangement.\"33 N. C. drew on the occult energy theories of a French esotericist, Eliphas Levi (Alphonse Louis Constant), who held that the world was charged with something he called \"Akaz\" energy. To this idea, N. C. added the notion that the universe resonated with an \"Astral Fluid\" that could be detected by the human nervous system. His definition of \"Astral Fluid\" is worth reprinting in full, for it shows the churn of ideas in vital magnetism and American Metaphysics: It is not akaz, but a different form of cosmic ether. Its existence is based upon the fact that certain phenomena can only be explained upon the assumption of such a substance. It is an object of direct perception to persons possessing a highly trained psychic sense. It is that entity in the manifested solar system which corresponds with what has been called \"the fourth principle\" in man. Though it exists uniformly throughout space in the solar system, it is yet more dense around certain objects by reason of their molecular action. This is especially the case around the brain and spinal cord of human beings, where it forms what is called the \"aura.\" Where it still more closely surrounds the nerve-cells and nerve-tubes it is called the \"nerve-aura,\" which is not the nerve-fluid, but the aura of the nerve-fluid. This astral fluid only comes into existence when differentiation takes place in the original Mula Prakriti, or undifferentiated cosmic matter, the one essence in its pralayic condition. If the scientists recognize a distinction between bound ether and free ether it amounts to the same kind of distinction as that between astral fluid and akaz. As, according to the hypothesis of the scientists, ether can be thrown into vibration, and in that form transmit the energies of light, heat, and electricity, so in like manner is the astral fluid capable of receiving, transmitting, and retaining impressions of manifold kinds.34 With such speculations about the energies of the universe, the writers anthologized in the Portable Library entice us far away from magnetic healing in the American Midwest. Vital magnetism endured, in part, because it resonated with ideas in American Metaphysical culture. a m a g n e t i c h e a l e r i n i o w a 63 Despite conceptual modifications, the physical practice did not change very much. Historian Norman Gevitz has shown that American magnetic healing remained very tactile.35 In fact, the techniques practiced in the late nineteenth century closely resembled those of a hundred years before. E. D. Babbitt advised, \"When Liver, Stomach and general Visceral system are torpid, knead them thoroughly, without causing too much pain, but especially make a large circle over them, moving up on the right side over the ascending colon, across the liver, stomach, and spleen, and down on the left side over the descending colon. This is admirable for Costiveness, and should be practised several minutes each night and morning. For Diarrhea, move in just the opposite direction.\"36 Magnetic healing was distinct from other irregular medical systems, though, in that it seems to have been almost entirely conducted by single operators. It strongly resisted the institutionalization that characterized eclecticism and homeopathy, professions that organized to challenge regular medicine. Magnetic healers did not have a national association protecting their collective interests. Most individuals became magnetic healers by taking a correspondence course, reading about magnetism, studying under an established practitioner, or simply hanging out a shingle in imitation of one's neighbor. The proprietary orientation seems to have amplified a sense of individualism in magnetic healing, in comparison to other alternative systems. With practices often located on the outskirts of town, their marginal status even had a spatial component. Furthermore, many healers seem to have been itinerants who made their living on the lecture circuit of smalltown civic groups and intellectual societies. Magnetic healers usually faced financial struggles, competition from other magnetists, and criticism from orthodox physicians. In this, however, magnetic healing reflected patterns common even to orthodox medicine in rural America. In the 1890s, requirements for practicing medicine were still quite lax, with proprietary institutions dispensing the majority of medical degrees. The majority of orthodox physicians were hardly more educated than their sectarian rivals. Competition was a fact of life. All kinds of healers were challenged within their own towns: paper wars show hostilities between orthodox physicians and medical sectarians, and among members of individual groups. Furthermore, despite their questionable social position, magnetic healers were patronized by enough Americans to make a few quite rich. Possibly the best known of these was Sidney Abram Weltmer, whose \"Weltmer Institute\" in Nevada, Missouri was a prosperous institution in the 1890s, and remained open until 1930.37 At the turn of the century, Weltmer and more than a dozen 64 a m a g n e t i c h e a l e r i n i o w a associate magnetic healers treated as many as 400 patients a day, and housed many of them in a seventeen-bed hospital. Nationally known, the Weltmer Institute received 150,000 mail inquiries a year, and scores of typists and stenographers were hired to respond to the correspondence. Years later, Nevada residents attested to having seen Weltmer's employees carrying deposits of cash to the local bank quite literally, \"in bushels.\" The Weltmers' success attests to the great economic possibilities in magnetic healing, but there is no evidence D. D. knew of the Weltmer family. He seems to have been more familiar with a practitioner named Paul Caster,38 who operated a magnetic clinic and hospital in Ottumwa, Iowa.39 A farmer until suffering an accident while moving a log, Caster embarked on a career as a \"public healer\" in 1866. Three years later, he moved to Ottumwa, where he opened a magnetic practice in 1871. That year, Caster began construction on an infirmary reported to have had 100 patient rooms and a bed capacity of at least 150.40 Later, these buildings would serve as the first facilities of Ottumwa Hospital.41 \" w h at c a n b e d o n e i n d av e n p o r t e v e n b y a q u a c k \" It is unclear that D. D. Palmer and Paul Caster ever were personally acquainted. While many histories of chiropractic assume the two had a relationship, Caster's death in 1881 preceded D. D.'s embarking on a magnetic career. Yet their stories show common points, beginning with the derogatory description of Caster by one Ottumwa doctor, who might as well have been speaking of D. D. Palmer, as well: \"corpulent, coarse and uncouth in his physique, without education or knowledge of the world gained by travel, and with a defective articulation but with a fair share of natural sense and shrewdness.\"42 Caster's success provoked considerable resentment among regular physicians. Like D. D. Palmer, Paul Caster was remembered as self-educated and self-interested, as well as socially suspect. Given his local celebrity, it is very likely D. D. knew about Caster's operation. D. D. seems to have copied Caster's business model of an inpatient magnetic hospital. His attempts to do this in Burlington, however, were frustrated by the impact of the Caster \"brand.\" Paul Caster's son Jacob Caster opened a magnetic practice in Burlington, Iowa in 1888 or 1889. Assuming the dates are accurate, D. D. Palmer was already offering magnetic treatments in that town before the younger Caster's therapeutic debut. Jacob, however, took advantage of his family name by claiming his father recognized him as possessing the same occult healing power, and he seems to have continued his magnetic practice as late as 1914.43 Nor did his being a magnetist hamper his a m a g n e t i c h e a l e r i n i o w a 65 public standing; he was elected mayor of Burlington in 1904. Jacob Caster's great professional advantage in Burlington may have inspired D. D. to seek more hospitable territory. In the late 1880s, D. D. moved to Davenport. With a population of 22,000 and bright prospects as both a transportation and manufacturing center, the town was set to become one of Iowa's most prosperous cities, with a vibrant intellectual life, Davenport had an opera house and a natural history museum, and was a regular stop for the Chautauqua circuit.44 The diversity of health options was just as rich, reflecting the national pattern of therapeutic pluralism. A few years earlier, a survey of 23 Iowa counties had determined that 70 percent of health practitioners were orthodox physicians, with the rest dispersed across eclecticism, homeopathy, and other healing systems, including \"spiritualists,\" \"oculists,\" and \"electricians.\"45 Christian Science had an especially strong presence in the state as well, and some of these healers may have been listed in the 1876 survey as \"nondescripts.\" In Scott County, where Davenport is located, in 1876 there were 39 \"regulars,\" 10 homeopaths, 4 eclectics, and 11 \"irregular practitioners, traveling and advertising quacks.\"46 Almost certainly, some in this last category were magnetists, for Davenport's growth had invited several magnetic healers to hang out shingles. Their advertisements give a sense of their practices\u2014and the promises, assumptions, and conditions under which they operated. In 1876, a \"Dr. Broadbent\" opened a short-term practice at the Burtis House. He claimed to have more than 30 years of experience as a healer. For lung problems, Broadbent sold a patent medicine called \"Medicated Inhaling Balm Vapor,\" but for other conditions, his ad promised, \"Many of the diseases the Doctor cures without medicine, by LAYING ON OF HANDS, by human electricity. It is really marvelous to see how quick he can cure pain, and remove diseases of the nervous system instantly, by the magic touch of his hands.\"47 Three years later, \"Dr. J. Munson\" maintained an office above the Mason & Smith's City Drug Store, where he charged $1.50 a treatment, and fifty cents more for a house call.48 Munson promoted the efficacy of his treatment in a front-page advertisement in the Daily Davenport Gazette: \"The Doctor heals by imparting to his patients Human Electricity or Animal Magnetism, thus arousing the dormant energies of the system to expel disease in accordance with the law governing the human system. His treatment elevates and sustains the vital forces, and thereby assists Nature in her great work of healing diseases and restoring health.\" Munson faced competition from another magnetist, however, who practiced a few doors down on Brady Street. \"Dr. J. H. Thatcher's\" ad 66 a m a g n e t i c h e a l e r i n i o w a ran directly below Munson's in the same 1879 issue of the Gazette; he specialized in \"Vital Magnetism Vapor Baths.\" Even the briefest review of Davenport publications shows magnetic healing was a fierce business environment. D. D. Palmer's marriage to Martha Henning did not last, although, as with D. D.'s first marriage, the formal outcome is not known. His daybook from 1886-1887, however, carries a note that conveys D. D.'s sentiments on the relationship: \"Be not deceived by women, 3 times have they been a curse morally, physically and financially.\"49 By 1888, he had taken his fourth wife, Villa Thomas. This was said to be a stormy relationship; chiropractic detractors have played up Thomas's supposed addiction to morphine. Even so, the pair stayed together until her death in 1905. D. D. Palmer seems to have had better luck in business than with women, for his magnetic practice flourished. In 1888 he began to publish a series of newsletters to generate patronage of his magnetic practice. The first paper was called The Educator, but no issues survive. Since the oldest extant paper, The Magnetic Cure, dates to 1896, one cannot describe the early editions. The consistency of content and style in later editions, however, suggests that much of the content in D. D.'s \"advertorials\" varied little across many years of publication. This makes it possible to use the earliest surviving issues to evaluate how D. D.'s magnetic practice had grown. The advertorials detailed his fee schedule for prospective patients. \"Consultation free. Treatments, $10 for the first week and $5 for each week afterwards, except lupus, cancers, tumors and special cases, which are twice the above prices. Treatment and rooms to be paid for one week in advance.\"50 D. D. offered both residential and outpatient treatments. His advertising materials indicate that he had a well-appointed suite of rooms in the Ryan Block in Davenport, which he used as a magnetic healing \"hospital\": \"I have furnished rooms and board for patients from a distance. The rooms are heated by steam-arm night and day. Beds, $3 per week; board, 15 cents per meal. . . . Advised patients that these rates did not include private attendants: If patients need a nurse they must bring such. . . . Our parlors, office, and infirmary are the finest in the city. . . . My forty-two rooms are well furnished. The halls and rooms are lighted by electric lights and heated by steam. They are all on the fourth floor of the Ryan Block and reached by an elevator. They are away from the dust and noise of the streets. Being the top floor, we have an abundance of light and air; centrally located, two blocks from the ferry.\"51 By the middle of the 1890s, his average annual income was more than $3,000.52 D. D.'s endeavor provoked resentment among Davenport physicians. In a letter reprinted in the city newspaper, one doctor complained, \"A crank on a m a g n e t i c h e a l e r i n i o w a 67 magnetism, has a crazy notion that he can cure the sick and crippled by his magnetic hands. His victims are the weak-minded, ignorant and superstitious, those foolish people who have been sick for years and have become tired of the regular physician and want health by a short-cut method. While many of our educated medical profession are idle the above knave has all he can do. . . . He exerts a wonderful magnetic power over his patients, making many of them believe they are well. His increase in business shows what can be done in Davenport even by a quack.\"53 Through the envious bitterness of the doctor's letter we find corroboration of D. D.'s success. The size of D. D.'s practice grew, alongside an income that matched or surpassed that of many physicians. It raises the question, \"What was D. D. doing, exactly, as a magnetic healer?\" The notes on magnetic healing in D. D. Palmer's journal show his earliest physiological understandings combined older and more recent medical ideas. His diary enumerates various \"causes\" of disease in a manner consistent with other popular health literature: Constipation, from congestion or held up secretions in liver, spleen, pancreas, stomach & kidneys. Curvature of Spine in young or old, from Kidneys. Throbbing in stomach is it caused by spleen[?] Female Weakness caused by indigestion, lack of assimilation Diptheria, Croup; Tonsilitis, Bronchitis, Laryngitis, Quinsy, are from a stomach. Shaking Palsy, Running sores, Ulceration of ears, absesses of teeth [sic], Bladder disease, from Kidneys. Facial Paralysis from Spleen. Hemiphlegia from organ of hope & that from the stomach. Paraplegia from spine injury. Sciatica (so called) from injury in some joint of Spine. Lumbago from Spine. Rheumatism from congestion of Kidneys, Stomach, or liver.54 These points, listed but not explained in D. D.'s writing, make sense when placed in the context of nineteenth-century popular health culture, which had a distinct vocabulary that cut across competing theories and disclosed a collective debt to older medical doctrines. Through the eighteenth century, European and American medical thought was predicated on a humoral understanding of the body. Most illnesses were ascribed to either \"congestion\" or \"inflammation,\" which in turn were the 68 a m a g n e t i c h e a l e r i n i o w a result of systemic or local fluidic excesses or depletions. Essentially, humoral medicine was a \"hydraulic\" theory of anatomy and physiology. Humoral therapeutics were intended to remove blockages, drain off excess fluids, and redirect improper flows.55 In the nineteenth century, humoral theories dropped from view, but the conditions they caused\u2014inflammation and congestion\u2014were retained as factors in disease pathology. Fever, seen as one of the most pernicious illnesses, was explained as a type of general \"inflammation,\" here understood as the buildup or unnatural location of fluids in the body. D. D., too, identified fevers as caused \"from congestion somewhere,\" and he was confident that neuralgia always resulted \"from congestion of the spleen\u2014no matter where located.\"56 The logic that allowed D. D. to identify a \"diseased stomach\" as the cause of tonsillitis and laryngitis, and the kidneys as the trouble behind ear ulcerations and tooth abscesses, resonated with popular health ideas. In an age with a still-impoverished cellular theory, medical thinkers tended to see the body holistically. Tissues and organs were understood as simple structures rather than complex entities. Internal processes were described as the proper or improper \"functioning\" of organs, whose relations accounted for states of health and sickness. The result was a tendency to treat bodily parts like the components of a clock or other mechanical device. One of the chief manifestations of bodily failure, therefore, was a condition of \"derangement,\" the imagined distortion of an organ, which not only resulted in its own dysfunction but had the potential to injure tissues and organs around it. D. D. would use this term a lot over the next several years. Derangements worked their nefarious magic \"sympathetically.\" A bit of background is helpful here. The \"doctrine of sympathies\" was a popular belief in Western medical thought, dating at least to the Renaissance and likely even earlier. \"Sympathy\" maintained that bodily parts communicated in ways that transmitted illness to each other. An accepted tenet in European medicine at the end of the eighteenth century, ideas about \"sympathies\" were carried into the new empirical schools by vitalist theorists like Xavier Bichat and Joseph Barthez. The latter commented, \"A Sympathy is a responsiveness between organs not necessarily contiguous, so that mechanical impingement of one organ on the other, or oscillation from its movement, could not be its cause. For example, an infection in one organ echoes in another\u2014sometimes in its counterpart (as when one ear or eye affects the other), sometimes in entirely different organs (as when the uterus and breasts affect each other). Sympathies exist also between an organ and the system it participates in, between an organ and the entire body, and through a m a g n e t i c h e a l e r i n i o w a 69 an affection of the sensorium commune.\"57 Why would anyone believe this? Better yet, why did this perspective become such an established medical precept? Something to consider is the way \"sympathies\" were used. A common example in period literature for the doctrine of sympathies was tetanus pathology. Theorists were aware that a wound to the foot could bring on the fatal condition of lockjaw. It was considerably more difficult, in the absence of histology and germ theory, to explain why an infected heel could affect the neck and throat. Sympathetic theories emerged, then, at an important historical moment\u2014when anatomy and physiology were on the threshold between premodern and modern formulation. It appears a similar liminality animated D. D.'s own medical understandings. B. J. Palmer claimed that, while a magnetic healer, his father also sold items of folk medicine: \"charms\" to cure \"ague\" and toothaches.58 There's no proof for that, but clearly D. D. had become broadly familiar with the proliferation of health ideas that circulated in American popular health discourse. That his beliefs were a mixture from several periods of medical discovery speaks to the creative assembly D. D. brought to his application of knowledge. Most importantly, D. D.'s healing theories were works in progress that he often revised. Despite his early identification of spinal injuries as the cause of paraplegia, sciatica, and lumbago, in the 1880s and 1890s his interest was on the organs in general, rather than the spinal column with which chiropractic is most often associated. That kidneys\u2014an important site in D. D.'s etiology\u2014were linked to spinal curvature suggests he believed visceral problems could cause vertebral trouble, a perspective which was the mirror image of later chiropractic theory. By the 1880s, D. D. also appears to have embraced many ideas about healing from the Metaphysical movement. Another note in his journal asserts a relation between the mind and body and their interdependence in matters of health and illness, both ideas that circulated widely: Commence your treatment by allaying the fear of disease or drugs. Silently measure the patient. The fear removed the patient is healed. Matter cannot take cold, fear opens the door for cold. Grief causes suffering and disease. Mentally exhibit to the wrong doer the suffering his vice or belief causes, that there is no pleasure in those beliefs. No genuine pleasure in sin. Vehemently and forcibly if necessary awaken your patient from his dream of suffering. 70 a m a g n e t i c h e a l e r i n i o w a Patients suffer only as the insane suffer, from mere belief. Disease, disarrangement, is disturbed harmony. Mind produces all action, conscious or unconscious. Moving thots [sic] produce disease\u2014malice, revenge, remorse, grief, worry, spite, etc. Allow none to give drugs but must rely wholly upon you. The healer puts disease at ease. Give yourself a treatment first\u2014be sure that you are O.K. In infantile disorders treat the mothers & friends as well as the child. Don't ask what is deranged but\u2014why? The tailor addresses your clothes, the Medicine Dr. the body, The mental cure the mind, The Metaphysician the soul or spirit. The mind must be cured as well as body, as the mind so is the body. Disease is only the manifestation of error or wrong doing, wrong thots [sic]. Thots are real substance and modify all they touch, wherever we send them. Kind thots purify, unkind thots makes disease, disharmony. Enquire what state of mind at time of taking of disease or accident then deny the cause.59 The premises D. D. recorded were central to a set of healing spiritualities, which were known under several names, including \"Mental Healing,\" \"Mind Cure,\" and \"Science of Mind.\" Christian Science drew on this therapeutic logic as well. All these modalities assumed that bodily health proceeds from the mind. Because thoughts (or \"thots\"\u2014D. D. was one of many popular intellectuals fond of \"reformed spelling\") generated reality, sickness was the result of \"negative thinking,\" and recovery and well-being the reward of the \"positive.\" This passage provides important evidence of D. D.'s early familiarity with Metaphysical healing concepts, though a process of transformation would be required for them to become part of chiropractic theory. More than his journal, D. D.'s self-published newsletters provide detailed information about his healing beliefs and practices. They also illuminate D. D.'s greater worldview and put his thought in context by conveying the social environment in which he lived. In the 1890s D. D. Palmer's advertorials had a distinct format: each newsletter consisted of one full sheet of newsprint, folded to constitute a four-page broadside. These pages were divided into as many as seven columns; as a result, the typeface was extremely small. The content of the advertorials followed a set pattern, too. The upper left-hand a m a g n e t i c h e a l e r i n i o w a 71 corner of the front page usually carried the following explanatory message: \"This paper aims to answer all questions. Please look it over and save writing. See page 1, 2, 3, 4, marked, for answer to your questions. I mean what I say in print, as much so as if I had written it.\" The bluntness of D. D.'s opening statement was continued through the rest of the newspaper, which reverberated with the coarse wit of popular intellectual culture. The advertorials included jokes and numerous poems showing the difference between allopathic medicine and chiropractic. \"The Chiropractic's Song,\" which appeared in 1899, exemplified the humorous quality of Palmer's publications. No drugs or poisons deadly, With their disastrous medley, Into your stomachs should be poured; But by manipulation deft, Not an ache or pain is left, And your former vigor is restored.60 Certain stock items were reprinted in almost every edition. D. D. introduced himself, promoted his hospital, and announced his rates for treatment. The broadsides also carried other information, including prices for the goldfish D. D. seems to have continued to sell for many years. D. D. used the advertorials to align himself with populist rejections of professional medicine. The full title of The Magnetic Cure included the subtitle \"How to Get Well and Keep Well without Using Poisonous Drugs.\" He railed against regulatory medical legislation and the compulsory vaccination of either people or livestock. One sees populist responses to science in his writings, too, as in his skepticism about bacterial theory. In the advertorials, D. D. argued that bacteria were scavengers that proliferated in a human body due to aggravating causes, and were not themselves the cause of disease. Throughout every stage of his life, D. D. Palmer drew from a wide range of nineteenth-century ideas. As a result, his theories were bricolages of fragments spanning several decades. Palmer's writing harbored a scientific worldview substantially unlike our own. Like other Progressive Era popular intellectuals, D. D.'s inquiries were defined by a body of knowledge that had yet to incorporate cell theory. Consequently, like many lay people he resisted the new scientific medicine. Germ theory, vaccination, and the notion of specific agents modeled on diphtheria antitoxin sounded preposterous to some modestly educated but culturally engaged Americans. D. D. indulged the skepticism of his readers by writing, \"If we were to receive instructions from the would be learned physicians, we would believe that every breath of air, 72 a m a g n e t i c h e a l e r i n i o w a every drop of water, every bite of food was filled with some form of microscopic life, so very small that only costly microscopes could reveal them, owned only by the profession; that everything our Creator has made and given us to support life is filled with death.\"61 His scorn for these ideas echoed suspicions reverberating through popular health literature. It is testimony of his ambitions that D. D. should appropriate the mantle of scientific progress, asserting that medical orthodoxy had come under the sway of \"superstition.\" Most of all, the \"advertorials\" contained letters from satisfied patients. These comprised the bulk of many issues of the serials. D. D. seems to have encouraged patients to write such testimonies, though he himself probably bestowed their catchy titles: \"A Cancer Removed Without a Knife or Plaster,\" \"Cures a Klondiker,\" \"He Thinks the Quack Doctor is OK.\" The true authorship of these letters, however, is unclear. The testimonials are formulaic to the point of throwing doubt on their authenticity. At least some were submitted by known associates of the Palmers, and their genuineness does not appear to be in doubt. Yet D. D. seems to have edited several letters that appear in slightly different versions through successive issues of his publication. In light of this artistic license, it is possible that Palmer wrote some of the letters, but this cannot be proven. Palmer's broadsides were consistent with a larger genre of popular-medical print media. It was common for proprietary medical practitioners, both orthodox and sectarian, to advertise through such self-published \"newspapers.\" Health newsletters were designed to prove the superiority of proposed treatments and to warn potential patient customers of the danger in trusting other modalities. To this end, the publications developed a stock appearance. They often included charged criticism of other medical systems and personal attacks on local rivals. The entrepreneurial style of D. D.'s publications reflected the competitive nature of nineteenth-century American health culture. Conflict between sectarianism and orthodoxy was a major challenge for irregular healers, as was a series of internal disputes that troubled both regular and irregular medicine. Individual competition for patients, however, often overshadowed these better-known forms of social tension, as aspiring physicians of all stripes aggressively pursued greater \"market share.\" It is even possible that some of D. D.'s patient endorsements had been copied from other journals put out by rival healers, who themselves typically reprinted material without proper attribution. Liberties taken with copyright characterized the whole genre of nineteenth-century popular health literature. This points to the geographic and conceptual proximity of healers to each other. Aspiring health entrepreneurs like D. D. faced dual challenges. a m a g n e t i c h e a l e r i n i o w a 73 They needed to fit their message to the American health vernacular, for by meeting cultural expectations they were more likely to attract patients. They also had to present their own practices as superior to their competitors, and for this reason the pursuit of ideological \"distinctiveness\" was a priority across irregular medicine. As magnetic healers went, D. D. Palmer seems to have been making quite a bit of money. His annual income and the inpatient hospital in the Brady Building appears to have provoked the ire of orthodox physicians. In 1895, the year of chiropractic's birth, D. D. faced what seems to have been the first of several investigations, this one by a local society of medical doctors.62 He retaliated by suing for the right to practice medicine without a license, claiming to cure by the laying on of hands\u2014a statement rich with Christian overtones and presaging the \"drugless healing\" orientation of much of the chiropractic profession.63 Even so, D. D.'s commitment to \"drugless healing\" should not be taken at face value. A note in his journal from this period lists the correct dosages for several popular medicines: laudanum; camphor; rhubarb; peppermint; capsicum; and \"aquamonia\" (ammonia), which, interestingly, was a period home remedy for rheumatism.64 As with so many things, D. D.'s behavior here was consistent with his culture. As a grocer, he would have become familiar with the sale of these medicines. His was a \"layered\" entrepreneurialism: rather than abandon old business endeavors, D. D. usually added in new ones; hence the fact that he still was selling goldfish, at the price of \"Two for 25 cents; Eight for $1.00.\"65 The lawsuits may have been what prompted D. D. Palmer to go public with the \"discovery\" of chiropractic soon afterward. As previously mentioned, there are reasons to doubt the validity of the Lillard Incident. In the 1950s an organization chartered to advance the cause of chiropractic commissioned a study on the history of the profession. The lead investigator, Cyrus Lerner, who was largely positive toward chiropractic though hostile to the Palmer family, concluded that the Lillard Incident could not be established as true.66 At the very least, there is confusion among primary sources as to the exact date the adjustment is to have taken place. The January 1897, edition of The Chiropractic contains a testimony allegedly authored by Harvey Lillard. Lillard reported that he had received two treatments between January and April of the previous year. In a 1904 advertorial, The Chiropractor, D. D. Palmer set the adjustment in September 1895.67 My own sense is that D. D. Palmer's encounter with Harvey Lillard was built over time into a myth of great discovery. Later versions of the story frame the Lillard Incident not as an accident, but as a process of experimentation, 74 a m a g n e t i c h e a l e r i n i o w a or \"investigation.\" By 1910, when D. D. published his most famous book (colloquially known as The Chiropractor's Adjuster), he described the event in the following way: Harvey Lillard, a janitor, in the Ryan Block, where I had my office, had been so deaf for 17 years that he could not hear the racket of a wagon on the street or the ticking of a watch. I made inquiry as to the cause of his deafness and was informed that when he was exerting himself in a cramped, stooping position, he felt something give way in his back and immediately became deaf. An examination showed a vertebra racked from its normal position. I reasoned that if that vertebra was replaced, the man's hearing should be restored. With this object in view, a half-hour's talk persuaded Mr. Lillard to allow me to replace it. I racked it into position by using the spinous process as a lever and soon the man could hear as before. There was nothing \"accidental\" about this, as it was accomplished with an object in view, and the result expected was obtained. There was nothing \"crude\" about this adjustment; it was specific, so much so that no Chiropractor has equaled it.68 Why did D. D. proclaim the practice of chiropractic? On the one hand it appears to have been a strategy for \"branding,\" a way to create a distinctive practice, separate from other forms of touch-based treatment that were widely available. Ironically, in his attempt to be \"different,\" D. D.'s endeavor once more placed him in the rank and file, for in the late nineteenth century, there was a proliferation of treatments with idiosyncratic names, such as Alathiasis, Viavi Hygiene, Pneumato-therapy, the Electro-chemic system, Vitapathy, and Electrolibration. Most names on a list like this one would be proprietary variations on more widespread practices. It is important to take seriously D. D.'s claims of medical breakthrough. His life's trajectory after 1895 suggests he really did believe he had discovered an important \"law of cure.\" Here too, his sincere belief is in keeping with a curious aspect of nineteenth-century popular physiology\u2014that so many individuals thought they had achieved some unique knowledge about healing. Their \"discoveries\" speak to the individualism of popular intellectuals, as well as to their faith that they, as individuals, were making important contributions to human knowledge. D. D. described the effect the Lillard Incident had on him. \"Thus the science (knowledge) and art (adjusting) of chiropractic were formed at that time. I then began a systematic investigation for the cause of all diseases and have been amply rewarded.\" His word choice is quite meaningful. A a m a g n e t i c h e a l e r i n i o w a 75 philology of \"investigation\" pulls one back to an era of lay scientific discovery. From the Enlightenment to the professionalization of science in the nineteenth century, intelligent nonspecialists could and did make solid contributions to the \"advancement of knowledge.\" The word summons the homemade researches of Ben Franklin, flying a kite in the rain, but \"investigation\" also speaks to many of the activities associated with nineteenth-century alternative religions. Spirits, thought force, ethereal matter, signature trails of magnetism or vibration, the flatness or hollowness of the world\u2014all these were regarded as potentially real entities that one could detect. The word and the acts of self-discovery it implied were used to support the truth claims of many religions. American Metaphysicians also described spiritual activities with terms of \"research,\" \"experiments,\" \"investigations,\" and \"findings.\" In fact, Spiritualists, Theosophists, and Christian Scientists each saw themselves as superior because their beliefs could be scientifically studied. This integration of content from the realms of science and religion developed amid their conflict, in the context of the Fundamentalist-Modernist Controversy. Like Liberal Christians, spiritual \"investigators\" hoped to determine religious truths that accorded with modernity. Because \"supra-natural\" phenomena were thought to be real parts of the world order, they were distinguished linguistically and conceptually from the \"supernatural,\" which Metaphysicians rejected as false and backwards \"superstition.\" Yet if their embrace of science appears to have been a strategy for modernity, it also represented an attempt to transcend the limits imposed by science through an expansive understanding of base reality. D. D. announced in his advertorials that chiropractic would \"bear investigation.\"69 This statement reflected his confidence, but also called for readers to explore and make discoveries of their own. It was an invitation into a more enchanted world. Progressive Americans believed in the efficacy of ideas: that one could determine truth for oneself, that this truth could be disseminated to others, and that doing so would have repercussions for humanity. As the literal frontier \"closed\" with westward expansion, many people looked to the frontier of new ideas, and reimagined their worlds. Donald Meyer has argued that Metaphysical spirituality gained traction in the late nineteenth century, as a modern post-industrial society came into being. This happened, he writes, because \"positive thinking\" offered Americans strategies of \"adjustment\" by which they could express individuality in a society that tended to render people anonymous \"cogs in a machine.\"70 In the nineteenth century, many 76 a m a g n e t i c h e a l e r i n i o w a Harvey Lillard, the first Chiropractic patient. Archives, David D. Palmer Health Sciences Library/Palmer College of Chiropractic. writers advanced the idea that \"thoughts are things,\" which in Metaphysical culture was a reference to how the human mind connected the person to both the material and spiritual worlds. But in another sense, \"thoughts are things\" described American thought, and the assumptions that shaped its contours. Thus D. D.'s claims to discovery cannot be read simply as charlatanry, nor as the crazy beliefs of a \"crank on magnetism.\" The discovery of chiropractic offered a deep existential purpose, a path to greatness. Before moving on from the Lillard Incident, I want to call attention to a detail that is highlighted in most versions of the story and to explain its importance. Harvey Lillard was of mixed race, and he was one of only a handful of African Americans with a prominent role in early chiropractic history. From photographs, Lillard appears to have been a dapper man, with a large handlebar mustache. Some accounts identify him not simply as the janitor for the Brady Building, but the owner or manager of the company that handled building maintenance. It is likely, however, that his ethnicity set him apart from the predominately white Davenport population. a m a g n e t i c h e a l e r i n i o w a 77 Moreover, Lillard is practically the only African American mentioned in early chiropractic history. In its early days and into the present, chiropractic has been an almost entirely white venture. But the topic of race is never absent from the chiropractic story. Regionally and demographically, its source culture overlapped with that of movements tinged with white supremacy, such as nativism, agrarian populism, and Fundamentalist Christianity.71 The intentional whiteness of early-twentieth-century Midwestern culture still informs present-day chiropractic, for despite its alignment with \"progressive\" alternative medicine, the profession's strongholds continue to be in the conservative American Heartland. Despite D. D.'s claim to have discovered a new system, the ties between chiropractic and magnetism remained strong for several years. D. D. Palmer continued to list himself in city directories as a \"Vital Healer,\" and when he opened a propriety institute in the late 1890s, it was called the Palmer Institute (or Palmer School) of Magnetic Cure. His earliest writing affirmed the magnetic theories found in the Portable Library. Their influence is readily apparent in one of Palmer's earliest surviving broadsides. The Magnetic Cure was printed in 1896, a year after the Lillard incident that marked the beginning of chiropractic. The broadside thus dates from the chiropractic era, yet its title reflects the fact that for the first two years of chiropractic D. D. Palmer continued to describe his treatment as a form of magnetism. In the 1890s, D. D. Palmer's unifying principle was that internal obstructions within organs acted as morbid causes for illness.72 This theory of disease pathology was quite similar to the one promoted in vital magnetism, but it also connected to a broad array of popular medical ideas. D. D. Palmer resembled many early-nineteenth-century physiologists when he conflated the conditions of \"inflammation,\" \"congestion,\" and unspecified bodily \"obstruction.\" Allegedly, these related ailments caused the buildup of toxic substances, with diffuse effects throughout the body. In this vein, D. D. wrote, \"A tumor is so much refuse matter piled up.\" Similarly, he believed lupus was the result of a blockage of the spleen. The accumulated splenic secretions acted as an \"internal toxin\" that caused the facial lesions associated with the disease. With internal blockages framed as the single cause of disease, D. D. presented magnetism as an effective, countervailing force. His confidence in the plenary potential of magnetic healing can be seen in his proclamation that \"This Vital Magnetic Power of curing disease is sufficient to heal any disease when we know how.\" In a dizzying list, the advertorials enumerated all the conditions he could treat successfully: \"Rheumatism of any kind, neuralgia, the various kinds of stomach ailments, diseases of the liver, kidneys, 78 a m a g n e t i c h e a l e r i n i o w a bowels, bladder, spleen, heart, throat, and head, male and female diseases, periodical headaches, fever, lung fever, bronchitis, nervous diseases, shaking palsy, quinsy, running sores, abscesses of the lungs, liver or stomach, catarrh, pleurisy, sprains, lameness caused by injuries, asthma, malaria, dyspepsia, female weakness, diabetes, chronic diarrhoea, constipation, loss of strength and vitality, eczema, indigestion, erysipelas, dropsy, diphtheria, some diseases of the eye and ear, painful menstruation, piles, incontinence of urine or bed-wetting, consumption, lupus, cancers and tumors when not too far gone, and some cases of paralysis.\"73 D. D. claimed his technique restored the proper balance of vital energies, so as to reduce inflammation, obstruction, or congestion, and restore equilibrium within the body. The true nature of disease was an internal disharmony, which magnetists were uniquely endowed to correct: \" ' Vital Magnetic Healers' Have in all ages been able to heal the sick by the laying on of hands. . . . Magnetism is of man, the highest of creation, and is healing and life-giving, imparting vital and nerve force. . . . Magnetism emphasizes the life forces, giving life, strength and rest, bringing both harmony and health. . . . Magnetism is life, and when applied to the human body where the cause of disease is, a wonderful change is often produced in one treatment. It electrifies the whole system, kindling the nerve-ethers and the blood, thus awakening a new life power which is able to eject impurities and prevent the stagnation that causes so much disease. The converts of magnetism are they who have witnessed its power, felt its force, and rejoice in health.\"74 In 1896, D. D. Palmer looked throughout the human body for the sources of disease. Any organ could become inflamed or obstructed, but D. D. seemed to see the viscera as particularly vulnerable to such blockages. The abdominal cavity was the site of a large portion of the treatments he performed at this time. In fact, far from being central, the nervous system was ancillary to other bodily organs in Palmer's earliest theory. Palmer went so far as to suggest that nervous complaints actually were rooted in other ailments. This view underscored D. D.'s thoughts on rheumatism. He maintained, \"Rheumatism is always caused by a cold, which causes a congestion in one of the vital organs. The congestion causes a tension of the nerves and muscles which reach out to the different parts of the human body. The cold does not settle in the parts or places affected, as is usually supposed, but is located and congests a part or the whole of the stomach, or kidneys, or liver. These organs are supplied with nerves which reach out through the whole body. A portion of the stomach or other organ is congested and causes a tension of the nerves running to a part or parts of the body, and produces a disease there called Rheumatism.\"75 a m a g n e t i c h e a l e r i n i o w a 79 While chiropractic is now best known as a treatment applied to the vertebral column, D. D. did not accord the spine much importance early on. Relatively few letters in the 1890s broadsides suggest D. D. focused on the vertebrae at the time. Still, as far back as 1896, he was receptive to the idea that a problem in the spine could act as a morbid cause of systemic illness. The article, \"A Lame Back,\" reported that D. D. correctly attributed a case of rheumatism to a spinal injury. D. D. Palmer was aware of the proximity of magnetic healing to other forms of bodywork, and he sought to distinguish his practice from similar modalities: I am often asked what difference, if any, there is between massage and animal magnetism when applied to the healing of diseases. Magnetic treatment, or rather vital magnetic treatment, consists in vitalizing any diseased organ or diseased part of the human body, giving life, action, a natural condition to the diseased part, by the healer giving a part of his life direct to the diseased part. If the kidneys, stomach, liver, spleen, or any other organ is congested or inactive, the magnetic [sic] sends a life force from his hands, which most patients can feel, into that dormant organ, arousing it to action, thereby assisting it to throw off the unnatural condition. Massage treatment consists in rousing to action and throwing off disease by manipulating the whole body by slapping, pinching, kneading, rubbing, etc. No matter what organ or part of the body is the cause, they treat the whole body because they don't know or care to know where the cause of disease is. Many so-called magnetic are massage healers. While the masseur is rubbing or slapping all over the body he is unconsciously throwing into his patient his vital force, with the disadvantage of a great waste of vitality because it is scattered over the whole body instead of into the organ or part diseased.76 This kind of proclamation, which reverberated in D. D.'s early (and later) writing, only makes sense after considering the prevalence of touch-based therapies in American health culture. Rubbing the body has been a traditional component of healing, done by doctors, folk healers, and lay people. Long before the discovery of chiropractic, liniments, ointments, and salves were part of the therapeutic canon of nineteenth-century American domestic medicine. In The Family Nurse; or Companion of the Frugal Housewife, Lydia Marie Child advised rubbing the limbs of children suffering from rickets, and she prescribed camphor soap liniment as a 80 a m a g n e t i c h e a l e r i n i o w a treatment for rheumatism.77 Thomas C. Clarke saw even greater benefits in such treatments, advising readers of The American Pocket Library of Useful Knowledge that, \"Friction of the body is one of the most gentle and salutary kinds of exercise, cleaning the skin, dispersing stagnating humors, promoting perspiration, strengthening the fibres, and increasing the warmth and energy of the whole body.\"78 Such recommendations also were made by regular physicians, including high-ranking medical authorities like Edinburgh physician Andrew Combe and German physiologist Johannes M\u00fcller, the latter of whom declared, \"Mechanical influence by frictions acts under certain circumstances as a vivifying stimulus; it has this effect, probably, by inducing slight chemical changes in the tissues, as a consequence of which their affinity for the general vital stimuli already in the organism is increased.\"79 The array of emollients prescribed in the nineteenth century points to the centrality of bodily manipulation in popular health culture, but it should be noted that health practitioners were often ambivalent about how to \"handle\" their patients. Some historians have speculated that the spread of syphilis made physicians reluctant to touch the sick, and they have called attention to the risks associated with too roughly treating tubercular patients whose skeletal systems tended to be ravaged by the illness.80 The realities of these two endemic diseases may have contributed to the relatively late development of medical orthopedics, especially in the United States, where the specialty did not advance until the 1870s.81 It therefore seems likely that magnetic healers and other touch-based therapists were filling a void in regular medical practice. In the late nineteenth century as in prior years, much of the treatment of musculoskeletal problems remained in the hands of folk practitioners known as \"bonesetters.\"82 Despite their name, the setting of broken bones was seldom the primary task of these practitioners. Bonesetters were called in more often to restore dislocated joints or treat general musculoskeletal ailments. Few scholars have studied these healers, but American bone setting appears to have resembled the practice as it was done in western Europe, where bone setting historically had been a family trade. Bone setting followed family lines in part because of the popular belief that it was dependent on a spiritual power passed down as a hereditary gift. This idea was captured in the term \"natural bonesetters,\" a descriptor permeating the historical literature. This occult capability was one reason orthodox physicians tended to be quite hostile to bonesetters who, moreover, often were from the lower classes.83 a m a g n e t i c h e a l e r i n i o w a 81 It is likely that bone setting was imported to the United States from Europe, especially from England and France. The best-known American bonesetters were the Sweet family of southern New England, who plied their trade into the early twentieth century, but fragments of information across many sources suggest that other lay practitioners were scattered across the American therapeutic landscape.84 The historian Norman Gevitz has found a complaint made in 1884 by an American physician that bonesetters were found in every American city.85 In spite of condemnations of bone setting by regular physicians and some health reformers, opinions regarding bodily manipulations were often quite similar across therapeutic systems.86 The most ecumenical form of therapeutic touch was massage, which was revived in the nineteenth century after being ignored by medical practitioners for several decades. The rebirth of massage is often credited to a Swedish gymnastic instructor named Per Erik Ling, who in 1813 established the Royal Central Gymnastic Institute in Stockholm.87 Movements\" group movements, isometrics, and stretching, as well as the manipulation by trained attendants of a limb or other body part of a patient. It is likely that Ling's \"Swedish Movements\" may have been a systematized version of preexisting movement treatments, making his actual role in popularizing massage unclear, though he is widely regarded as a founding figure in massage therapy. Around 1850, English and American writers began extolling the benefits of \"Swedish Movements\" to an Anglophone audience under the modified name, \"Movement Cure.\"88 Early touch therapies often were known simply as \"rubbing,\" a common term in eighteenth-century domestic medical literature. Over time, a specialized vocabulary emerged, which still is used by the massage profession. To \"rubbing\" were added the closely related notions of \"friction\" and \"compression\"\u2014rubbing in light circles, and circular rubbing combined with light pressure.89 \"Manipulation\" was the term that appeared in the broadest array of therapeutic literature. Other techniques included \"stroking\" or \"effleurage\"; \"kneading\" or \"petrissage\"; \"percussion\" or \"tapotement\" (light pounding, often on the soles of the feet); and \"vibration,\" which described the shaking of a limb or other large portion of bodily tissue.90 The common language of \"manipulative therapeutics\" shows how tactile bodily management was a component across diverse modalities.91 But instead of acting as exponents of this common bodywork language, irregular healers often positioned themselves against it. Touch therapies were more than \"skin deep\" in nineteenth-century popular health culture. \"Manipulation\" was assumed to be effective on the internal 82 a m a g n e t i c h e a l e r i n i o w a processes of the body, and was seen as a valid way to cure disease. Often, the efficacy of touch was explained in neurocentric terms. Many systems prescribed touch as one of several means of stimulating the vital principle that resided in the nervous system. \"Rubbings\" were standard offerings at sanitariums and water-cure facilities, and one of the earliest introductions of Swedish Movements to the United States was in Russell Thatcher Trall's serial, The Illustrated Hydropathic Review.91 Later, the Philadelphia neurologist Silas Weir Mitchell included massage in his rest-cure, which was known for its deliberate fattening of patients.93 The popularity of touch-based therapies created challenges for rival practitioners. J. V. Wilson, whose book is included in D. D.'s Portable Library, sought to draw a boundary between vital magnetism and other forms of manipulative therapeutics: There is also another class of deniers, who, while they employ the Animal Magnetic force in the treatment of disease, ascribe the valuable results accruing therefrom entirely to the method of application, namely, Manipulation. They claim that the benefits derived from this therapeutic means are solely due to the mechanical effects of the treatment, and scout the idea of the action of a vital element. While manipulation is, of itself, undoubtedly beneficial, yet, by this means alone, we cannot account for the very marked effects so often produced by this treatment; and where mechanical force alone is employed as a remedial agent, as in the movement cure, where machinery takes the place of the hands, though the action is much more profound and thorough, I have yet to learn that it has accomplished such valuable results as have been obtained by the hands. But aside from all this, there is ample proof to show that to manipulation alone [sic] is not due all of the beneficial effects of this treatment. I have myself treated many cases of an inflammatory character, including acute rheumatism, where ordinary manipulation was first impossible, owing to extreme sensitiveness; but where, by holding the hands lightly over the inflamed part, the sensitiveness has been gradually diminished until full manipulatory action could be carried on with but little or no suffering, and, I am happy to add, in nearly every such case, so far as my memory serves me, the relief has been prompt and permanent.94 Similarly, from the beginning D. D. Palmer held a particular hostility to massage therapy. In the January 1896 advertorial, he included an article entitled, a m a g n e t i c h e a l e r i n i o w a 83 \"Massage and Magnetism,\" where he set out the main difference between these systems, and also commented on their respective positions in American health culture: Why do physicians recommend massage and object to animal magnetism? Because massage healers don't know anything of disease; they are willing to let the physician know it all. Magnetic [sic] study diseases (not medicine) and try to know the cause of each disease. Because massage healers are willing to act \"as an auxiliary to medicine\" and give the attending physician the credit of any benefit or cures he may make, magnetic object to being a cat's-paw for any physician, to the use of any medicine by his patients during his treatment because it is often more difficult to cure the poisonous effects of drugs than the disease. Magnetic also object to being an \"auxiliary to medicine\" and giving the credit of our cures to any physician. Because massage healers think it \"essential that patrons obtain the advice and consent of their physician.\" Magnetic healers don't cater to any physician, but take the responsibility of the case and act independently.95 Interestingly, the rationalization of massage runs parallel to the development of chiropractic, which may account for D. D.'s special animosity. Through much of the nineteenth century, massage and therapeutic touch were important treatments in many medical systems. Around 1900, massage came to be understood as a healing system unto itself, as a paramedical profession distinct from other modalities. Possibly the most famous advocate of massage was John Harvey Kellogg, who operated the Battle Creek Sanitarium.96 Between 1895 and 1930, Kellogg's The Art of Massage went through five editions for a total printing of 29,000 copies.97 By 1920, massage had become a distinct system and also had contributed to the development of physical therapy. D. D. was thus pressured to rebut a rising rival profession while building his own. In contrast to massage, D. D. highlighted his own special power of touch. He eagerly reprinted letters such as the one from Dr. A. Livezey of Yardley, Pennsylvania. It read, \"We went to Davenport, Iowa, to visit Dr. Palmer's celebrated 'Magnetic Cure and Infirmary.' He heals the sick, the halt, the lame, and those paralyzed, through the medium of his potent fingers placed upon the organ or organs diseased, and not by rubbing or stroking as other 'magnetic curers' do.\"98 Here, and across the early periodicals, one can detect the need D. D. must have felt to distinguish his own practice from that of his rivals. It was soon after printing this advertorial that D. D. began promoting chiropractic as an independent system. 84 a m a g n e t i c h e a l e r i n i o w a chapter three f r o m v i ta l m a g n e t i s m t o v e r t e b r a l v i ta l i s m Old Dad lacks soft soap and policy, but is aggressive. The latter quality\u2014not the former\u2014made Chiropractic. \u2014D. D. Palmer t h e m a g n e t i c m a n i p u l at o r By January 1897, D. D. had begun to charge for the monthly advertorials, setting a yearly subscription at twenty-five cents. He also had retitled his newspaper The Chiropractic, explaining that the new name was meant to introduce chiropractic as a practice \"done by hand.\" The name was bestowed by Rev. Samuel Weed, who was won over after D. D. healed first his daughter and then Weed himself. The minister's translation from the Greek was imperfect, but the name served as an important \"branding\" tool\u2014a means to identify a new and entirely different system of healing. D. D. had started to claim that chiropractic treatment was superior to magnetic passes, because while the latter used vital force to cool inflammation, the direct physical contact of his own system eliminated the friction between body parts that was its cause. In the late 1890s, chiropractic was very much a system in transition. During this time, D. D. Palmer shaped chiropractic theory into the practice as it is known today. It is challenging to precisely document this progression from magnetic healing, though, as few sources survive. The six issues of D. D.'s advertorials from 1896 to 1902 archived at Palmer College of Chiropractic form the basis of my discussion of early chiropractic theory. Many articles are reprinted across several issues, and these consistencies allow one to speculate about the content of the lost issues. Patterns show that between 1896 85 and 1902, D. D. distanced his system from magnetic healing and developed a select terminology for chiropractic therapeutics. His ideas about chiropractic from this time are known as D. D.'s \"First Chiropractic Theory.\" As late as 1897 D. D. understood chiropractic as a touch-based manipulative treatment oriented at removing various obstructions within the body. But a shift had taken place in Palmer's understanding of obstructions: rather than finding congestion in the organs of the thoracic cavity, D. D. looked to tissues that extended throughout the body. Obstructions now were most commonly associated with the circulatory and nervous systems, and with musculoskeletal structures. He saw these tissues as fundamentally interconnected, writing, \"The human body is a bundle of fine sensitive nerves, passing over, and under, and between the 200 bones and the many muscles and ligaments. These nerves are liable to be pinched, strained, stretched, or pulled out of place by the displacement of any one of the bones, muscles, or ligaments, causing any one of the nerve diseases.\"1 At times, D. D. presented internal obstructions as the result of the \"misplacement\" of organs. He professed a unique capability of finding such conditions. An anonymous patient letter, possibly written by D. D., promoted this skill: \"When Dr. Palmer examines you he knows just what is wrong. He will tell you just where the displacement or obstruction is and whether he can put such in order. He can tell you just what he expects to accomplish by each move, the nerve, artery or vein he wishes to free, or the bone, ligament, or muscle he wishes to replace.\"2 In identifying both the nerves and blood vessels as sites of potential bodily trouble, D. D. was connecting chiropractic to two perspectives in vitalism. Throughout the modern period, different theorists regarded either the nervous or circulatory systems as the conduit for life force. D. D. claimed obstructions in both systems could cause cancer as well as many other conditions.3 He expounded: \"Acute diseases are caused by an abnormal condition of the nerves, and obstructions in the circulation. Those nerves being inflamed, cause the fever, and the refuse of the system is retarded. With proper manipulation the nerves are put at ease in one, or at most, a few treatments and the refuse is cast out of the proper channels. . . . Rheumatism, and many diseases, of which they know no cause, are said to be blood diseases. Rheumatism is readily cured by relieving the tension of the nerves\u2014the nerves are pinched and unduly stretched.\"4 The 1897 publications showed an increased attention on the spine as a cause of disease. For example, Palmer cited spinal injuries as a cause of \"derangement\" of the kidneys. This word choice is important. \"Derangement\" reverberated with older medical understandings. It was part of the 86 f r o m v i ta l m a g n e t i s m t o v e r t e b r a l v i ta l i s m conceptual framework supporting nineteenth-century interpretations of the Doctrine of the Sympathies. A letter from Lillie Toher of Davenport reported that D. D. blamed her eczema on a spinal injury.5 Another Davenport resident, Walter McDonald, wrote that D. D. cured his bout with typhoid by successfully treating two injuries to his spine; he also relieved McDonald's headache \"by touch.\"6 D. D.'s growing preference for neurocentrism was drawing him to a health practice that would prove significant for the chiropractic profession. \"Nerve tracing\" was the charting of a nerve from the spine to an affected bodily part. Samuel Weed, who is credited with naming chiropractic, reported that D. D. cured him by treating the spine at the exit point of the sciatic nerve.7 Similarly, J. W. Ward of Rochelle, Illinois, wrote that his neuralgia disappeared after D. D. \"followed that nerve which gave me so much pain to where it was injured.\"8 This diagnostic approach would be popularized by D. D.'s son B. J. as the \"Meric system,\" and it would become a signature of the chiropractic profession in the twentieth century. From the perspective of present-day chiropractic, this was a significant development. In adopting \"nerve tracing,\" D. D. was not innovating, but picking up ideas that had circulated in popular physiology for several decades. The earliest example of \"nerve tracing\" I have found is in the work of an \"electric physician\" named Henry Hall Sherwood, whose book, Electro-Galvanic Symptoms, and Electro-Magnetic Remedies was in its third edition in 1837.9 Sherwood maintained that the nerves carried \"Galvanic forces\" to the organs of the body and recommended the use of \"spinal plasters\" on the different vertebrae, so as to increase \"galvanic flow\" to affected organs. A pioneer in \"electro-therapeutics,\" he treated patients with an induction-coil battery, which he advertised as a \"vibratory magnetic machine.\" He also sold \"Sherwood's Magnetic Remedies\"\u2014pills laced with small amounts of gold that were intended to induce internal electro-chemical reactions. By 1841 Sherwood had mapped the organs to the pairs of nerves exiting the foramen of the vertebrae. An expansion of his theories, The Motive Power of the Human System, contained several illustrations of the brain and nervous system, including a revision of his \"spinal chart\" with a striking similarity to ones used by chiropractors.10 Sherwood was accused of quackery by no less a scientist than Joseph Henry, the first Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. Yet The Motive Power of the Human System was reprinted sixteen times by 1850. Moreover, the eclectic physician Wooster Beach reprinted Sherwood's spinal charts in his own book, A Treatise on Anatomy, as did Joseph Rodes Buchanan in Therapeutic Sarcognomy.11 The popularization of Sherwood's f r o m v i ta l m a g n e t i s m t o v e r t e b r a l v i ta l i s m 87 H. H. Sherwood began producing \"spinal charts\" like this one in the 1830s. Western Michigan University Libraries. ideas in the mid-nineteenth century is dramatic evidence that the ideas on which chiropractic drew were long established. By adopting nerve-tracing, D. D. was shaping chiropractic in the direction of spinal-manipulative therapeutics, but as late as 1897 he still referred to himself as \"the magnetic manipulator.\"12 D. D.'s word choice shows that he continued to align with magnetic healing even while introducing chiropractic as a distinct new treatment. \"Not that we have ceased to believe in magnetic treatment, but that we have so much improved our method that magnetic does not fully cover our work. Under the chiropractic we can cure many cases which the magnetic would not reach.\"13 D. D.'s use of the term \"manipulation\" also was significant: in later years he would vehemently reject any comparison of chiropractic to \"manipulative therapeutics.\" His later hostility was 88 f r o m v i ta l m a g n e t i s m t o v e r t e b r a l v i ta l i s m foreshadowed in the 1896 and 1897 publications, where he showed a hearty disdain for massage techniques. In contrast to \"manipulative therapeutics,\" D. D. proclaimed the precision of chiropractic technique as one of its unique advantages. He wrote, \"A chiropractic does not slap, rub, pull, or work over a person in a promiscuous manner. Every movement is made with a distinct purpose in view. He knows where an abnormal condition exists, and experience has taught him how to return that to its natural condition.\"14 Years later, D. D. denied ever having considered the body mechanically, yet the 1897 Chiropractic issues contain several passages where D. D. compared human beings to machines.15 Organs and tissues were understood as component parts, similar to the machinery of an engine or within a watch. Palmer held that the body's parts were at risk of damage from \"friction,\" which chiropractic was meant to alleviate. For the most part, \"friction\" was a term associated with the outside of the human body; it referred to the \"rubbing\" performed in touch therapies like massage. \"Internal friction,\" though, appears to have meant the idea that internal obstructions caused \"inertia\" of the life principle. D. D. promised, \"When all parts of the human machine are made to work without friction and all obstructions are removed, then nature will bring strength and health.\"16 Here, D. D. seems to draw on \"mechanist\" anatomy and physiology, which as a body of knowledge was even older than vitalism.17 According to humoral and heroic medicine, internal bodily blockages made people sick. Often described as \"congestions,\" such obstructions created buildups of fluids that then needed to be removed from the body's \"hydraulic\" systems, so as to restore proper pressure balances, hence the need for bleeding and emetics. \"Obstructions\" also were seen as a problem in vitalism, because they prevented proper circulation or distribution of the life principle, fluid, or \"force.\" At least one eclectic physician used the \"friction\" motif in this way, putting mechanical anatomy into the vitalist camp.18 In the end, all one can say definitively is that D. D.'s ideas were an amalgam of popular theories, and his use of scientific knowledge was far from systematic. He appears to have been searching for an explanatory model that would justify chiropractic treatment; questions of intellectual consistency do not seem to have troubled him. In fact, it is hard to tell the commitment he had to any particular view. Is this a problem? It is unsettling if one prefers consistent thinking. D. D. was capable of holding conflicting ideas at the same time, in a way that demonstrates the capricious eclecticism of Troeltsch's Spiritual Religion. D. D.'s nod to the \"machinery\" of the human body could have been just another way to connect with his readers. Both in style and substance, the f r o m v i ta l m a g n e t i s m t o v e r t e b r a l v i ta l i s m 89 advertorials were intended to reach as many people as possible. The front page in 1897 bore the instructions, \"If you don't need this paper, please hand it to your friend who does. If you have no friends, give it to your enemy who is cross, hateful and mean because he is not well, and if he comes here and goes home well, he will be your friend as long as he lives.\"19 The humor in this statement reflects the general tone of D. D.'s writing. The advertorials were meant to be a dialogue, a forum in which D. D. sought to create relationships (at least imagined ones) with his readers. This point, too, was made humorously: Kind reader, please excuse my haste. I have many letters to read and write; Therefore I have no time to waste, Although I wish to be polite. My study is to please my patrons, May they be Misses, Gents, or Matrons.20 The advertorials were salted\u2014and peppered\u2014with quips, jokes, and poems. Many were directed at the medical profession, like \"The Medic's Song,\" which commanded regular doctors: \"Thou shalt not cure while we have power to kill; For if your wondrous work goes on who will our graveyards fill?\"21 Some, though, simply carried forth the earthy humor of turn-of-the-century Americana. For example, D. D. reprinted a poem (author unknown) against spring house-cleaning in the January 1897 Chiropractic: Father, dear father, come home with me now, For ma has some carpets to beat. She's got all the furniture out in the road, From the front porch clear down to the street. The stove must come down and be put in the shed, And the yard must be cleared of dry grass. For it's time to clean house and the devil's to pay, And the front window needs a new glass. Father, dear father, come home with me now, And bring some bologna and cheese. It's most twelve o'clock and there's nothing to eat, I'm so hungry I'm weak in my knees. And the dinner we'll have will be scraps and such, And we'll have to eat standing up, too, for the table and chairs are out in the yard; Oh, I wish the spring house-cleaning was through! 90 f r o m v i ta l m a g n e t i s m t o v e r t e b r a l v i ta l i s m Father dear father, come home with me now, For ma is as mad as a Turk; She says you're a lazy old thing. And that she proposes to put you to work. There's pa\u2014\u2014 g to do, and paper to hang, And windows and casings to scrub; For it's house-cleaning time and you've got to come home And revel in suds and cold grub.22 Items like this poem reveal the dry playfulness of a man who had little patience with \"respectable,\" middle-class values. D. D. was sincerely a \"down-to-earth\" man, yet the jokes and poems are more significant than their surface meaning. As historian Kenneth Cmiel argues, Progressive Era populists used a \"plain,\" \"democratic\" rhetoric as a means to challenge social and economic elites. \"Down-home\" humor was antiauthoritarian, a protest against the \"refined\" communications of the establishment. D. D. intended the folksiness of his writing\u2014and especially his humor\u2014to resonate with the \"calculated bluntness\" of the \"popular vernacular style.\"23 His writing strategies cast both his persona and the chiropractic system as part of the broader cultural dissent of American populism, of which health culture was one of the most vigorous expressions. With this point in mind, D. D.'s mockery of the medical establishment takes on new meaning. The advertorials contained many articles that were skeptical of developments in regular medicine. For example, an article against diphtheria vaccination was accompanied by a picture of a skull and crossbones.24 Another passage, entitled \"Bacteria,\" is worth reprinting at length: Bacteria is a very small organism to be seen only by the microscope. In the medical fraternity it has become a craze. Bacteria, either animal or vegetable, exists in different forms in different tissues of the body, and in many of the diseases thought to be contagious. In their office bacteria must be classed as scavengers. The buzzard, the hyena, the jackal, the intestinal worms, and the bacteria are all scavengers. Scavengers exist upon decaying animal and vegetable matter. . . . In diphtheria a microscopic life is often found, because the unclean decaying matter is favorable to their growth. They did not cause the disease, but the disease made favorable food for them. Then what relation does bacteria bear to disease? Is disease a result of bacteria, or vice versa? Bacteria draw their sustenance or food f r o m v i ta l m a g n e t i s m t o v e r t e b r a l v i ta l i s m 91 from dead matter. They cannot live upon healthy, normal tissue. . . . The bodies or tissue must first be weakened, the life force below par, and decay begun before any bacteria or scavengers can gain a foot-hold; hence in healthy tissue and healthy bodies they are powerless to exist. But on diseased tissue bacteria find suitable food and multiply. The learned profession wrongly book the disease to their credit. The bacteria is a secondary result.25 The theory D. D. was proposing was rather common in popular physiology. The concept of \"friendly\" scavenger bacteria, which lived on the body's decaying waste products but were not themselves causes of disease, fit the hygienic worldview in which \"autointoxication\" often was seen as a leading cause of illness. Over a century later, it is easy to lose sight of how controversial the new medicine was among American health consumers. Germ theory, vaccination, and other innovations that now are widely accepted took several decades for the general public to embrace. D. D. was airing sentiments held by his readers, and he validated their concerns, proclaiming, \"Dissatisfaction in the use of poisons for diseases is becoming more apparent every day. Thinking men and women are seeking other methods and leaving the medical path that has been so blindly followed for years. They are beginning to study man more and medicine less.\"26 Part of D. D.'s \"pitch,\" therefore, was a challenge of the medical establishment, for he knew that would play well with prospective patients. He made a direct appeal to the cultural dissent of the health movement when he wrote, \"People have been led to believe that all medical laws were made for the 'protection of the public against quacks.' But the facts are, that these laws are usually framed by professional quacks for their own protection. These laws decide what school of doctors you shall employ. A diploma from one of these favored schools will protect any opium or whisky soaked quack of that profession to poison and butcher unmolested.\"27 D. D. was only one of many health entrepreneurs to trade on popular resistance to regular medicine; even in Davenport, he was not the only option local citizens had in the way of \"drugless healing.\" D. D. had to set boundaries against potential rivals, yet it was also advantageous to call attention to the similarities between chiropractic and other healing systems. He used the advertorials both to align his treatment with and distinguish it from other practices. It appears that D. D. was not fully hostile to regular medicine until a local association of regular physicians targeted him. Although this position changed, in 1896 D. D. stated, \"Medicines and medical doctors are necessary; we cannot get along without them. But they cannot cure everybody. Neither can I.\"28 92 f r o m v i ta l m a g n e t i s m t o v e r t e b r a l v i ta l i s m D. D. made even stronger overtures to Christian Science. In The Magnetic Cure, he expressed his sympathy for Christian Scientists who were unjustly prosecuted.29 In a piece that was reprinted in several issues, \"Died Without Medical Aid,\" D. D. left open the possibility that Christian Science, mind cure, magnetism, and osteopathy were capable of cures that regular medicine could not accomplish.30 Yet the article argued for the superiority of chiropractic, undercutting D. D.'s ostensible receptivity to other systems. This stance is evident in \"Healing the Sick,\" which positioned chiropractic against both spiritual healing and touch-based therapies: \"Thousands are cured by faith cures, Christian science, mind cures, magnetic, mesmerism, massage, etc. etc. But by what means none can give an explanation that would be received by the thinking masses. We know there is a cause, for every effect has its cause. To-day we have a comprehensible explanation of the fundamental principles upon which all these cures are made.\"31 Notwithstanding these partial attempts at mutual respect, D. D.'s accommodation of other healing practices would prove short lived. Later he would argue for the total uniqueness of his own system. Even in the broadsides from 1896 and 1897, he expressed a hope that chiropractic would supersede all other therapies. One passage makes his intended direction perfectly clear: This is the only system of treatment ever devised for the cure of diseases that is founded upon a practical application of nature's laws of human anatomy and physiology. Many methods of dealing with man's infirmities have arisen only to live a short time and then be abandoned and cast aside as worse than useless. These systems have had for their foundation everything that man could dream of except a practical, natural knowledge of how to fix and right that which was wrong. They have used the signs of the zodiac, charms, necromancy, prayer, light, heat, water, air, hypnotism, magnetism, electricity, poisonous vegetable and mineral drugs even the microscopical bacteria and microbes; in fact everything but an understanding of the being they wished to control. Is it any wonder that failures has [sic] marked the pathway of all these systems.32 D. D. made chiropractic a great therapeutic wonder, but throughout his entire life, he was possessive of chiropractic knowledge. Proclaiming himself its sole discoverer, for the first few years, he maintained an aura of secrecy about the treatment. D. D. seems to have had a change of heart and mind, however, in 1897. That year, he seems to have been in a railway accident, which he later claimed made him fear for his life and for the future of his f r o m v i ta l m a g n e t i s m t o v e r t e b r a l v i ta l i s m 93 system. D. D. maintained the accident inspired him to share the chiropractic secret with the world, and thus he opened the Palmer School of Magnetic Cure, offering to teach magnetic healing, \"to anyone who has the qualifications,\" for a monthly fee of $100. He may have been seeking ways to prop up a declining income, for Vern Gielow's tally of D. D.'s annual profits shows a drop in revenue between 1896 and 1897 of more than $750.33 An economic explanation is especially persuasive considering that D. D. had taken on at least on chiropractic student, C. H. Collier, by December 1896. This sets his plans for a chiropractic school well before the accident that supposedly brought him to his evangelizing stance.34 D. D. hoped \"Dr. Palmer's Chiropractic School & Cure\" would help put chiropractic on a scientific platform. At least, that was how he promoted the venture in his advertorials, where he wrote, \"We are establishing a school where we can explain intelligently why certain manipulations produce certain results, the direct causes of disease, and how to cure those diseases by natural methods.\"35 But by modern standards D. D.'s school hardly deserves the name. The \"education\" consisted mostly of lectures by D. D., and students were seldom, if ever, exposed to laboratory sciences, cadaver dissection, or the other elements of a conventional healthcare curriculum. The Palmer School was quite typical of the health-training institutes of its day. Most were proprietary businesses or joint-stock companies. At such institutions, the centerpiece of one's course of study was signing the enrollment contract; actual training might include attendance at lectures, but often could be done through correspondence alone. In the early 1900s a researcher named Abraham Flexner was commissioned by the Carnegie Foundation to report on the condition of American medical education. The \"Flexner Report,\" issued in 1910, damned most instruction as \"hopeless.\" Many institutions lacked clinical facilities, libraries or laboratories; in others, these rooms were distinguished from others only by the signs they had painted on their doors. Few schools practiced dissection on more than guinea pigs; human cadavers, though rare, were \"hacked\" and \"putrid.\" Admission standards were shockingly lax: one \"Professor\" from Pennsylvania defended his student body with the remark, \"The most I would claim is that nobody who is absolutely worthless gets in!\"36 After the Flexner Report, greater scrutiny of medical education led to the closing of many colleges, but this change was several years away when D. D. opened the Palmer Institute. With tuition for a course in chiropractic set at $500, D. D.'s income increased rapidly, rising to $9,000 by 1898.37 At this 94 f r o m v i ta l m a g n e t i s m t o v e r t e b r a l v i ta l i s m time, along with operating his own school, D. D. may have earned additional money by teaching magnetic healing at an irregular medical school in Chicago. Between 1897 and 1898, a \"Dr. D. Palmer, Magnetic Healing\" was listed on the faculty of the Independent Medical College. On this point as with so many details of D. D.'s life, no more is known.38 Whether D. D. was teaching students in both Davenport and Chicago, or only in the Quad Cities, it is important to acknowledge the impact of the creation of the Palmer School on D. D.'s venture. While it brought him needed income, it also paved the way for additional competition, this time from his own students. At the turn of the century, chiropractic was still D. D.'s personal enterprise, but was about to grow into a larger cohort of vitalist therapists. Some early graduates would become colleagues to D. D.; others portended to be rivals\u2014often within weeks or even days of getting their diplomas. Three issues of The Chiropractic survive from the period between 1899 and 1902. From these copies it appears that D. D. reprinted much, and likely most, of his material in successive editions. The redundancy of the serials notwithstanding, D. D. introduced new ideas as well. Fresh articles and revisions to older ones both show the steps by which D. D. moved chiropractic toward the specific paradigm of spinal adjustment. Between 1896 and 1899 D. D. had shifted attention away from the viscera and toward systemic bodily issues. In the next three years, he put more focus on both the nervous and musculoskeletal systems. As the century closed out, D. D. still linked illness to problems in the circulatory system. Increasingly, he identified trapped nerves as a first cause in the disease process. We see this in a frequently reprinted piece, \"Cancers\u2014 Their Cause and Cure.\" D. D. still maintained that cancer was the result of both obstructed blood circulation and injured nerves, but in 1899 he wrote, \"A Cancer is the expression, the output, the effect of an injured nerve.\"39 D. D. was making use of common neurocentric beliefs, linking health to a somewhat occult force within the nervous system. \"The proper nerve supply being restored, the normal functions are quickly established.\"40 His understanding of obstruction also had changed. Less mention was made of the viscera as a site of blockage or treatment. In contrast, both obstruction and therapeutics were now more often focused on the skeleton and musculature. D. D. wrote, The bones are liable to be misplaced, partly or fully dislocated, be that ever so little they press upon ligaments, muscles, nerves and blood vessels, thereby deranging not only the local part, but often disturb the natural workings of the various organs by lessening the supply of nerve f r o m v i ta l m a g n e t i s m t o v e r t e b r a l v i ta l i s m 95 and blood fluids. Nature demands that the circulation of the fluids of the body be free and uninterrupted. A lack of circulation means strangulation. Strangulation causes many diseases, such as dropsy, running sores, tumors, and the various skin diseases. Nature's method is to free the circulation and permit the refuse to be thrown out of the body through the natural channels. A pressure upon any one of the nerves causes such diseases as paralysis, rheumatism, neuralgia, asthma, female diseases and the numerous diseases of the stomach, liver, and kidneys. All motor and sensory powers are derived through the nerves. How necessary then is it that they should be perfectly free to act. Strange but true, all the nerves of the body may be reached and acted upon by the hands.41 In 1899 D. D. Palmer had not yet given the spinal cord primacy in the chiropractic system. He still adjusted other parts of the body. This is reported in the article, \"Cures a Klondiker.\" Davenport resident W. H. Hicks thanked D. D. for healing the nerve \"caught\" in his numb left foot by working on his lower leg.42 Similarly, Edith Fitzpatrick of Rock Island attested that D. D. removed her corn by \"adjusting\" the second toe on her left foot.43 The 1899 advertorial recorded some instances, however, where Palmer accorded substantial attention to the vertebrae. One example can be found in the letter by \"Ed. W. Burch\" of Donahue, Iowa. His daughter Essie avoided surgery by seeking treatment from D. D. Palmer for an \"enlarged spleen.\" The father wrote, \"Dr. Palmer came and found a displacement in the lower part of her spine, which he said caused an obstruction of the fluids of the body and a pressure on the nerves of the left leg, causing that limb to be much shorter than the right.\"44 Despite his enduring commitment to vitalism, D. D. Palmer now sought to increase the distance between chiropractic and magnetic healing. He rejected the idea that he used \"animal electricity or magnetic power\" and referred to himself as \"the chiropractic manipulator\" rather than a \"magnetic healer.\" D. D. explained that magnetism worked by adding vital force to the body, so as to relieve the imbalances created by obstructions. In contrast to magnetism, chiropractic eliminated obstructions and promised a result of restoration of natural equilibrium. D. D. invoked an interesting metaphor to make this point: \"How do Magnetic and Chiropractic treatments differ? If a journal heats we pour on water to cool it; in the human machine we pour on magnetism to relieve inflammation. With the chiropractic treatment we adjust the journal and box so that they will not heat; in the human machine we adjust each part to its proper place so that 96 f r o m v i ta l m a g n e t i s m t o v e r t e b r a l v i ta l i s m all works in harmony without friction.\"45 For the curious, a journal is the part of a rotating machine, like an axle or line shaft, that touches the bearings\u2014literally the site with the potential for maximum friction. Conceptually and metaphorically, D. D. was entertaining ideas more typically seen in \"mechanist\" physiology. One is left to wonder if there was any reason to D. D.'s combinative rhyme. His thought demonstrated an exceptional philosophical parallelism: D. D. held many ideas to be potentially true, and activated different ones depending on mood and context. D. D.'s preferred terminology changed over time. Later on, he would come to reject any words associated with orthodox medicine, such as \"diagnose,\" \"cure,\" or \"treat disease.\" The 1899 advertorial shows this tendency well under way, with repeated references to chiropractic treatments as \"adjustments.\" This shift is one example of D. D.'s fastidiousness in the vocabulary he used to communicate chiropractic ideas. In light of his attention to language and desire to set chiropractic apart from other modalities, it is interesting that D. D. played up the similarity of his practice to lay bonesetting. He included in the 1899 advertorial a letter entitled \"A Bone Setter,\" whose author wrote, \"Dr. Palmer is often called a bone-setter, and such is a part of his work. He replaces bones, tendons, muscles, and nerves.\"46 Curiously, the author of this piece was anonymous, although most items in the broadside bore the names of their writers. It is possible that D. D. himself wrote the letter, but there is no way to verify this. By 1899, chiropractic was \"on the move.\" In addition to patient testimonials, the broadside reprinted endorsements from graduates of Palmer Institute who had gone into practice in distant cities like Boston, Buffalo, and Minneapolis. Other details also indicate some of D. D.'s innovative marketing. D. D. had promoted chiropractic as a form of \"bloodless surgery\" for some time, but this issue carried many more testimonials repeating the promise that patients could avoid operations. Many of these letters related graphic case histories. More than one described the excruciating \"scraping\" of bone abscesses. On a less serious note, D. D. invited the general public to come view the \"Largest Collection of Mounted Animal Heads, Antlers, and Horns in America.\"47 n e u r o c e n t r i c r i va l s D. D. devoted a lot of print space in the 1899 broadside to criticizing osteopathy, a rival healing system. In previous years, D. D. had drawn on the \"brandname\" recognition of osteopathy, by claiming the two modalities shared a philosophy of healing. That tactic continued somewhat, for the advertorial carried a testimonial comparing the two systems, in which the writer maintained, \"The underlying philosophy of Chiropractic is the same as that of f r o m v i ta l m a g n e t i s m t o v e r t e b r a l v i ta l i s m 97 Osteopathy with a wider range of possibilities for both operator and patient.\"48 In 1899 however, Palmer himself set the systems apart as quite different: \"The Osteopath and the Chiropractic both aim to put in place that which is out of place, to right that which is wrong; but the movements are entirely different. The Chiro is ten times more direct in the treatment and its efficiency, making cures in one-tenth of the time that an Osteo usually does.\"49 By 1906 D. D. accused osteopathy of being derivative of other systems.50 D. D. understandably denied any connections between chiropractic and osteopathy. The systems were quite similar in their origins and early formulations, but the creation of osteopathy preceded that of chiropractic by at least a decade. Osteopathy was developed by a Missouri practitioner named Andrew Taylor Still. Still started out as an orthodox physician\u2014of sorts\u2014having studied under his father, a country doctor. After serving as an army surgeon for the Union in the Civil War and later seeing several of his children stricken with spinal meningitis, he grew dissatisfied with regular medicine.51 Like many laypeople and most health reformers, Still became convinced that mainstream medical treatments were often dangerous, and at best ineffective. Like D. D. Palmer, Still was drawn to innovative spiritual and scientific ideas. In the 1870s and 1880s, he became interested in spiritualism, phrenology, and magnetic healing.52 These endeavors contributed to his vitalist orientation. Still came to understand obstructions in the vital fluids, especially the blood, as the major cause of disease. In time he went on to identify the soft tissues in bodily joints as the sites most prone to such blockages, singling out the vertebral column as especially important. This idea became the basis of osteopathic theory: the treatment was aimed at restoring proper vital circulation across the articulations of the body. Therapeutically, osteopathy resembled other forms of popular manipulative therapeutics. Like \"Swedish Movements\" and bone setting, it aimed at restoring mobility and vigor to skeletal joints.53 In 1892 Still opened the American School of Osteopathy in Kirksville, Missouri.54 By the turn of the century, osteopathy had grown to be one of the most visible challenges to medical orthodoxy. Conventional wisdom holds that osteopathy was primarily concerned with the circulatory system; in the system, blood had a vital nutritive function. Still, however, believed health depended on the harmonious circulation of both blood and \"nerve supply,\" which he understood to be an indeterminate substance created in the brain and carried through the nerves.55 Still suggested it might correspond to cerebrospinal fluid, which he called, \"One of the, if not the most highly refined elements in animal bodies. Its fineness would indicate that it is a substance that must be delivered in full supply continually 98 f r o m v i ta l m a g n e t i s m t o v e r t e b r a l v i ta l i s m to keep health normal.\"56 In some of Still's writing, he even portrayed blood as subordinate to the nervous system, as when he stated, \"The blood supply comes under the motor system of nerves, and delivers at proper places for the convenience of the nerves of nutrition.\"57 Osteopathy attributed disease to obstructions of vital circulation caused by disarticulations between bones. Not simply neurocentric, Still privileged the spinal column as a major factor in health: \"Every joint of the neck and spine has much to do with a healthy heart and lung, because all vital fluids from crown to sacrum do or have passed through heart and lungs, and any slip of bone, strain or bruise will affect to some degree the usefulness of that fluid in its vitality, when appropriated in the place or organ it should sustain in a good healthy state. To the Osteopath, his first and last duty is to look well to a healthy blood and nerve supply. He should let his eye camp day and night on the spinal column; to know if the bones articulate truly in all facets and other bearings, and never rest day or night until he knows the spine is true and in line from atlas to sacrum, with all ribs known to be in perfect union with processes of spine.\"58 Still also seems to have incorporated the idea of nerve tracing into his physiology. This was evident in his explanation of osteopathy: \"I contend that the curing comes direct from the liberation of the interspinous and costal nerves, freed from bone-pressure on the nerves of motion, sensation, and nutrition.\"59 There is a longstanding disagreement between osteopaths and chiropractors as to which of their founders stole theories from the other. Many fragments of evidence have surfaced as proof of a personal relationship between D. D. Palmer and A. T. Still. Osteopaths have asserted Palmer sought treatment from A. T. Still in Kirksville and signed his name to Still's guest book.60 Others allege A. T. Still's son, Charles, knew D. D. Palmer as a student of an osteopath named Obie Stothers.61 Some chiropractic historians believe the two healers met, possibly at a Spiritualist camp meeting in Clinton, Iowa.62 None of these rumors has been confirmed, though the last one would be an intriguing corroboration of their shared Metaphysical interests. There is too much evidence to dismiss the argument that many osteopathic theories resemble points taken up by Palmer only a few years later, but it is difficult to find a \"smoking gun\" that would prove either Still or Palmer as the originator. D. D. himself invited foes to this search. \"Please do not twit me of learning this from Osteopathy. . . until you find the person who taught me.\"63 Yet his dismissive response of the charges is belied by the time and effort he invested in protesting them. The best evidence f r o m v i ta l m a g n e t i s m t o v e r t e b r a l v i ta l i s m 99 of some relation between D. D. Palmer and A. T. Still is in their respective writing. D. D. quoted Still quite liberally, demonstrating a familiarity with the Kirksville practitioner's work. Still does not seem to have read his chiropractic rival, even in his later writings. While at least some of D. D.'s knowledge of popular vitalism, physiology, and philosophy is likely to have come through osteopathy, this is not to say that Palmer \"stole\" chiropractic theory. Rather, it is likely D. D. was at least partly convinced of the truth of the core ideas expounded in Still's writings before he even read them. Both osteopathy and chiropractic were derivative of theories and practices very much in the public domain. The work of an early-twentieth-century Iowa historian shows just how close the network of vertebral vitalist healers could be. Harrison Waterman claimed A. T. Still was a patient of the renowned Iowa magnetist Paul Caster and was directed by Caster to magnetic healing.64 If this assertion is true, it would place D. D. Palmer and A. T. Still in the same intellectual-spiritual lineage. The controversy between Still and Palmer reflected the disputes that bedeviled vertebral vitalist healers. Their shared character gave rise to a vacillation of animosity and affinity among practitioners and theorists. Despite fierce competition, the boundary between these systems was softened by the many practitioners who pursued both osteopathic and chiropractic training. D. D. Palmer fought bitterly with former colleagues who became receptive to osteopathy, but many of his students, as well as those at other early chiropractic colleges, also sought training as DOs.65 Over time, D. D.'s efforts to separate chiropractic from osteopathy succeeded. Alexander Wilder, a noted historian of health reform, dismissed osteopathy as entirely derivative of Swedish Movements, but he also acknowledged the specificity of movements as a differentiating feature between Still's treatment and chiropractic.66 For D. D., and soon for the emerging chiropractic profession, the challenge from osteopathy was a major battle in a long campaign with other fights, large and small. A case from central Illinois illustrates this point: In May 1899, married couple Joseph and Nannie Gordon opened a magnetic healing practice in Rockford. Soon after, they announced the opening of the \"Gordon School of Magnetic Healing\" in broadside advertisements that closely resembled those of D. D. Palmer.67 Interestingly, the Gordons outdid D. D. in their commitment to vertebral vitalism in an advertorial with the promotional title Magnetic Healing Is a Mine of Wealth. Joseph Gordon held that deviations of the vertebrae affected different sections of the nervous system and thus were the remote cause of disease. Rheumatism and various \"spinal problems\" were among 100 f r o m v i ta l m a g n e t i s m t o v e r t e b r a l v i ta l i s m the most popular ailments reportedly cured by Gordon's treatment. A single such report of \"Spinal Curvature Cured\" captured several recurrent themes. \"A well known lady of this city had [stomach] trouble for years and had tried all the best physicians and failed to get relief. She consulted Dr. Gordon, who upon examination discovered a curvature of the spine which pressed against a nerve of the stomach that caused all the trouble. Dr. Gordon's treatments straightened the spine, removing the cause of the trouble and the lady is now in the best of health.\"68 Gordon's newsletter carried several illuminating photographs relating to both the cause and cure of disease. The centerpiece of the first page bore the photograph of a human skeleton presented dorsally. Beneath the illustration appears the following text: \"WHAT IS MAGNETIC HEALING?\"\u2014It's the science of regulating the impaired machinery of the human body to its normal condition by the movement of muscles in certain directions. This stimulates nerves that have become inactive and, upon resuming their regular office, they restore the affected parts to their normal condition. The magnetic healer is merely nature's agent in giving Nature\u2014the great healer\u2014the opportunity of effecting a desired cure. The attention of the reader is directed to the above chart which illustrates deviations in the spine and the number of these cases that are now under treatment by Dr. Gordon is surprisingly large. The deviation of the fourth dorsal vertebrae (which obstructs the great splanchnic nerve) would cause, for instance, stomach trouble, which is a matter of wonder to most readers of this paper. You must see how useless and harmful the taking of drugs would be in the treatment of such a case. No amount of medicine could remove the cause and, if naturally follows, no cure could be effected until the real cause is removed. Dr. Gordon's locates this cause and then rationally removes it by natural methods and a permanent cure follows.69 Most importantly, the Gordons' advertorial included several photographs of patients being treated \"magnetically\" that would provoke a sense of familiarity in chiropractors today. The scenes strongly resemble chiropractic adjustments, photos of which have long been a staple of chiropractic promotional literature. These photos speak to the relationship between chiropractic and other vertebral vitalist therapies in the Midwest at the turn of the century, testifying to a deeply ingrained folk medical culture that treated disease biomechanically, through spinal manipulation. f r o m v i ta l m a g n e t i s m t o v e r t e b r a l v i ta l i s m 101 The advertorials of both D. D. Palmer and the Gordons belong to the same genre of popular medical advertising. Boundaries were crossed in every direction, so that the line separating chiropractic from magnetic healing was blurred, as was the border between chiropractic and osteopathy. It was precisely because vertebral vitalist healers shared ideas, treatments, and business models that they all claimed to be true originals. Such healers were in complicated straits, between patronage and patenting. They needed to find ways to reflect enough of the vertebral vitalist perspective so as to be familiar, and thereby recognizable to health consumers, but they also had to distinguish their treatments from rivals who were in close proximity, intellectually and often geographically. In addition, this \"tacking\" did not occur in a vacuum. Real-world issues often intruded, in the form of scrutiny from medical and legal authorities. o b s t r u c t i o n s i n d av e n p o r t In September 1899 Dr. Heinrich (Henry) Matthey, a prominent member of the Scott County Medical Society, began a public campaign against \"drugless healing.\" Matthey's main goal was to introduce scientific health textbooks into the public school system to educate people away from unorthodox medicine, but the article he wrote for the Davenport Republican excoriated irregular practitioners, who he felt were both unscientific and fraudulent: Call them what you will\u2014Christian Scientists, magnetic conjurors of spiritualists, doctors, Osteopaths\u2014they are all the basest swindlers, and cannot be distinguished from the patent medicine manufacturers, and all those advertising quacks and institutes, by whose literature some have been driven to self-destruction, while others are confined in insane asylums. The experience of every physician with such unfortunates, whose minds have become diseased by this influence, tells him of the great danger, and should encourage him to wage a war of extermination against such conditions in our civilized country. . . . Another specimen is the magnetic healer or Cheiropath [sic]. Please remember, this monstrosity claims to have a diploma in heaven, which, he affirms invests him with supernatural powers. That such nonsense could be accepted seems hardly possible, yet such seems to be the case. I pity the poor patients who seek relief in his valley of death. . . . Disease itself is frequently terrible enough without voluntarily adding the fearful stench of the impostor's disgraceful crimes.70 102 f r o m v i ta l m a g n e t i s m t o v e r t e b r a l v i ta l i s m Given that Matthey and D. D. both had offices in the Ryan building, it is probable the two men knew each other. D. D. took the article as a personal attack. Rather than submit a response in the Republican, he printed and distributed his rebuttal in The Chiropractic. His \"reply\" to Matthey, whom he compared to a \"mad bull in a china store,\" was characteristic of the style in which D. D. addressed his opponents. \"Dr. M.'s whole article shows that either he had a nightmare, was bilious, or wanted to relieve himself of the public odium of not being able to tell chicken-pox from small-pox. The thousands of mistakes covered over in the cemetery does not worry him, but all this raving and distraction is caused by him knowing what the people know and think of him. . . . Slander is the chief weapon used in this coward's article. . . Dr. M. gives a prescription of urine mixed with faeces.\"71 D. D. concluded his retort by pointing out the error in Matthey's chiropractic nomenclature: \"Now, Dr. Matthey, before you write another four-column article look into an American dictionary, come to your normal senses and do not soar so far into sciences of which you know nothing, not even able to spell or apply them correctly.\" Despite the spiciness of \"Dr. Palmer Replies to Dr. Matthey,\" there is little else of historiographic interest in the 1900 advertorial. Nearly all the articles are reprints from previous issues, one important exception being an extended analogy entitled \"A Line Shaft.\" In this fictional account, a sick woman is compared to a malfunctioning factory engine. Just as the line shaft was seized, the woman suffers from a \"luxated vertebra.\"72 This story may have been Palmer's first use of the term \"luxation,\" a variant on the essential chiropractic concept of \"subluxations,\" which contemporary chiropractors see as a primary cause of pain and sickness. It seems that Palmer had begun to identify spinal luxations as a dominant pathology. He repeated the term in his revised version of \"Child-Bed Fever,\" which also ran in the 1900 issue. Here, he revised his previous assertion that an unspecified birth injury caused the illness. Now, he wrote, \"Child-bed fever is always caused by a lumbar luxation during child-birth.\"72 Clearly, in D. D.'s thinking, the spine was taking precedence over the organs, circulatory system, and connective tissues, but he still seems to have been receptive to the idea that other bodily parts could be implicated in pathology. Chiropractic historian Joseph Keating found evidence for D. D. teaching the \"first chiropractic theory,\" which was organ-based, as late as 1901.74 Around the time that D. D. and Matthey waged their paper war, a lawsuit opened against D. D. Palmer, mounted by a former student named H. H. Reiring.75 Reiring had enrolled as a student at D. D.'s school in March 1900, but he soon decided that chiropractic was little more than quack medicine. It is unclear he ever believed otherwise, for both his enrollment in the Palmer f r o m v i ta l m a g n e t i s m t o v e r t e b r a l v i ta l i s m 103 School and accusations against D. D. appear to have been encouraged by his association with Matthey. It is noteworthy that both were German immigrants, for the German population in Davenport was known to be tightly cohesive and politically active. D. D. Palmer seems to have overheard a conversation between Reiring and a German-American lawyer named Schmidt, who also had offices in the Ryan building. Reiring may have been announcing plans to incite other students at Palmer School. This triggered an argument between D. D. and Reiring, wherein the student demanded a refund of his money. D. D. ordered him to leave; when he refused, D. D. summoned the police and had him arrested. After Reiring was processed at the city jail, D. D. declined to file a written complaint. This decision left him open to a lawsuit for false arrest, to which a second charge of fraud was added later. According to Vern Gielow, the case was dismissed in January 1901, but Cyrus Lerner marked Reiring as a persistent gadfly and cites him as a factor in D. D.'s decision to leave Davenport in 1902. Before this happened, though, D. D. went on the offensive. In February 1901, he attended a Davenport school board meeting to argue against compulsory smallpox vaccination.76 It was a sign of chiropractic's increasing popularity that D. D. was confronted with opposition. Newspapers from across the country demonstrate how quickly chiropractic was spreading. As far away as Oregon, two chiropractors, D. A. McIntyre in Yamhill and H. O. Brown in Portland, were treating patients by spring, 1901.77 Often, chiropractors' services were bundled as part of a larger package of manipulative therapeutics. R. H. Honicker performed both chiropractic and osteopathy in Minneapolis, as did A. W. Berch in Wausau, Wisconsin.78 Not to be outdone, in Syracuse, New York, H. F. Simmons offered osteopathy, chiropractic and Swedish Movements.79 Practitioners in other states were proof of the success of the chiropractic model. In Iowa, their increase had mixed implications for D. D.'s venture. Some chiropractors, like W. Ambrose Seeley of Cedar Rapids, printed endorsements from D. D. in their own newspaper advertisements, suggesting they had his blessing to set up their own practices. Other figures represented an imminent threat, as they marketed their own versions of chiropractic as an improvement over what D. D. himself was promoting. This was especially true in the case of Solon Langworthy. chiropr actic theory and intellectual property A former shoe salesman, Solon Massey Langworthy held a degree from the American College of Manual Therapeutics in Kansas City, Missouri.80 In the 104 f r o m v i ta l m a g n e t i s m t o v e r t e b r a l v i ta l i s m summer of 1901, Langworthy enrolled at the Palmer Institute; he seems to have taken a diploma three months later. The timing of his graduation is significant: by the second week of September he had opened a health home and proprietary training program in Cedar Rapids, Iowa called the Langworthy School of Chiropractic. It appears Langworthy's efforts to establish himself on an equal professional footing with D. D. may have started within three or four days of finishing the Palmer course. On 20 September 1901, Langworthy ran an ad in the Cedar Rapids Evening Gazette that may\u2014or may not\u2014have been taken as especially ominous, for it carried an intellectual certainty often missing from D. D.'s writing: \"Chiropractic removes the pressure from impinged nerves and cures disease.\"81 Outside the chiropractic world, this statement is inconsequential, but chiropractors and chiropractic historians feel much is at stake in properly establishing the true discoverers of chiropractic theories. Setting D. D. Palmer up as the progenitor of the idea of \"impinged nerves\" delivers a legitimacy to the side of the profession that his legacy represents; similarly, undermining his role in creating chiropractic strikes against the Palmer name. There is no real way to tell whether Langworthy was publicizing ideas that D. D. had taught him and had yet to write out, or whether D. D. eventually adapted to the theories of his former student. Langworthy seems, however, to have preceded the Palmers in using certain spine-oriented terminology, which they later took credit for and which continues to be used by chiropractors today. Palmer's spinal emphasis reached full flower when he recognized spinal displacement as the main type of obstruction affecting the nervous system. In the 1902 advertorial, displaced vertebrae were identified as the preeminent cause of disease in some patient testimonials. The wife of a Davenport ticket agent named C. C. Gardiner was cured of abdominal pain after D. D. corrected her lumbar luxation.82 S. D. Moore from Argo, Iowa wrote that his left ankle had been injured four years previously when he was kicked by a cow. He was able to throw away his crutches after D. D. addressed the real source of his trouble, which the chiropractor had correctly found was in his spine.83 \"Chiro Triumphs\" related the tale of Nettie Kroger. Regular physicians told the Davenport woman she had syphilis. Bereft, Kroger sought out D. D., who concluded she suffered from eczema, caused by a spinal luxation.84 A focus on the spine warranted the discounting of symptoms in other regions of the body. A \"slight luxation\" in his vertebrae caused Davenport resident B. F. Dunham's bladder and prostate trouble.85 In an even more serious case, f r o m v i ta l m a g n e t i s m t o v e r t e b r a l v i ta l i s m 105 a letter from Mrs. Adolph Klinkradt of Davenport reported that D. D. told the woman her stomach condition, previously diagnosed by medical doctors as cancer, was really due to a \"luxation of the spine.\"86 Testimonials like these suggest that Palmer now understood displaced vertebrae as the sole cause of disease, for which chiropractic offered a comprehensive remedy. Ironically, the 1902 issue also contains contradicting evidence in the form of continued references to the freeing of \"pressures\" on nerves and blood vessels, reprinted in the old article, \"Cancers\u2014Their Cause and Cure.\" This likely reflects D. D.'s \"pack-rat\" approach to writing. He was reluctant to abandon text or ideas that had some utility left in them. As a result, his published work was \"cumulative\" at the expense of intellectual consistency. One can appreciate why D. D. had misgivings about sharing his chiropractic \"secrets.\" Doing so had brought him success and publicity, but also competition and scrutiny. It was probably little consolation that he was not the only vertebral vitalist caught in such a bind. In 1901 Joseph P. Gordon was prosecuted for practicing medicine without a license. Remarkably, he won at both the district and appellate levels. Gordon's mistake was to admit that he healed through the use of \"manipulation\" to relieve the \"contraction of nerves.\" In the lower courts, both judge and jury were willing to frame these treatments as a type of mental science or spiritual healing, both of which were exempt therapies under Illinois law. The Illinois Supreme Court, however, found that Gordon's cures were physical in nature, in that they worked on the nerves, a bodily structure, which disqualified them as mental or spiritual therapies. Gordon's conviction in February 1902 was highly publicized\u2014not only in Iowa newspapers, but also in the Journal of the American Medical Association and even the New York Times.87 That some newspapers ran the story with the title, \"A Test Case Decided,\" attests to both the popularity of vertebral vitalist treatments, and the determination of medical and legal authorities to limit this activity by any means necessary. Given the publicity, D. D. probably knew about the outcome of the Gordon case. The conviction may have been an impetus for D. D.'s sudden flight from Davenport in May 1902, for he himself may have been facing indictment in Iowa. But it is not entirely clear why D. D. moved suddenly to California that spring. D. D.'s own explanation was that he needed to rush to the aid of an old friend named Thomas Storey, who was experiencing an unspecified personal emergency.88 Regardless of the motive, D. D.'s abrupt departure was an erratic and disturbingly self-interested act. In the fractious world of chiropractic, D. D.'s opponents maintain he departed like a thief in the night, taking all the 106 f r o m v i ta l m a g n e t i s m t o v e r t e b r a l v i ta l i s m furniture and supplies from the school and clinic with him. Staff arrived at work the next morning to find the patients huddled on the floor; D. D. had stolen their bedding! D. D. Palmer may have intended to return to Davenport. Shortly before he left for California, he assigned ownership of the Palmer School to his twenty-year-old son Joshua Bartlett Palmer (B. J.). This transfer of property seems to have been effected to protect D. D.'s business stake in the school. But D. D. stayed away from Iowa for more than a year; his whereabouts during this period are not entirely clear. Sources place him in Pasadena, California in the summer of 1902, where he attempted to open a chiropractic practice.89 That September, one of D. D.'s patients, George T. Hayes, died following c hiropractic treatment for tuberculosis. D. D. was arrested and indicted for practicing medicine without a license, but the charges were dismissed in October. This run-in with the law may have sent D. D. to Portland, Oregon, late in 1902. Some histories associate him with a short-lived proprietary institution there called the Pacific (or Portland) College of Chiropractic.90 More likely, D. D. went from Pasadena to Santa Barbara, where between 1903 and 1904 he was listed in the City Directory as a \"chiropractice.\"91 Santa Barbara was the site of what may have been an especially significant development in chiropractic history. On 1 July 1903, D. D. Palmer held a clinic attended by several chiropractic students. At the clinic, D. D. is reported to have over-adjusted the left dorsal vertebra of patient A. R. Renwick, causing the opposite side of his body to heat excessively. This phenomenon caused D. D. to identify the nerves, rather than the circulatory system, as the controlling force for bodily temperature.92 With this discovery, D. D. rejected the circulatory system in favor of a therapeutic rationale that was entirely nervebased, setting chiropractic on a path that has been followed, for the most part, without deviation, into the present day. From the time it first was announced in D. D.'s 1904 advertorial, the \"Santa Barbara Incident\" has been regarded by some chiropractors as a signature moment in the development of their profession. Yet, like the Lillard Incident that launched the profession, the \"Santa Barbara Incident\" may be apocryphal, or at least embellished after the fact to give it greater weight. By 1904 D. D. had ample motive to produce evidence that he had adopted a nervebased chiropractic theory a year earlier. This part of the story returns us to Iowa, as D. D. himself chose to do in late 1903 after being charged (and possibly briefly imprisoned) for practicing medicine without a license.93 For the moment, it is enough to understand that for the chiropractic factions who f r o m v i ta l m a g n e t i s m t o v e r t e b r a l v i ta l i s m 107 support the Palmers, the events in Santa Barbara represent a triumphant achievement. It may have been with an expectation of victory that D. D. went back to Davenport a few months later. Then again, his return could have been a product of his whimsy. Just as we do not know why he left Iowa, we cannot tell why he chose to go back, or even the exact month of his homecoming (December 1903 or January 1904). Amid all this uncertainty, on one point the historic record is definite: D. D. was very surprised when he got off the train. 108 f r o m v i ta l m a g n e t i s m t o v e r t e b r a l v i ta l i s m chapter four on the frontier of the new profession Some seek greatness, some acquire it, and some have greatness thrust upon them. \u2014Elbert Hubbard At the time of his departure for California, D. D. may have intended the handoff of the Palmer enterprise to B. J. only as a legal measure to protect the property in which he maintained an interest. Yet D. D. was an abrupt man, inclined to cut his losses through the failures of several marriages and commercial ventures. It is just as likely that D. D. had put his Davenport operation behind him when he left for California. While he was there, he does not seem to have thought much about the Palmer School. On returning to Davenport, he faced the unintended consequence of having to share the venture with his offspring. D. D.'s greatest surprise must have been that the school and clinic had continued to function in his absence. He did not hold high expectations for the son who had followed him through several marriages. A close reading of B. J.'s biography indicates that his descriptions of abuse at the hands of his stepmothers, though possibly embellished, appear to be rooted in truth. D. D. Palmer also was quite cruel to his son. B. J. remembered his childhood as one of pitiful rejection. He maintained that his father made him sleep outside the house in an unheated packing-box. Such charges point to lifelong resentment between the two men. Legend has it that B. J. was removed from school for bringing mice to class to scare the girls. Put out to work at the age of thirteen, B. J. tried jobs as a delivery boy and a church organist. His longest employment was on the vaudeville circuit, as a \"professional subject\" for a hypnotist named \"Dr. Flint.\"1 B. J. then returned home to assist his father and study at the elder Palmer's proprietary 109 B. J. Palmer. Archives, David D. Palmer Health Sciences Library/Palmer College of Chiropractic. institute. He was one of four students to graduate from the Palmer School of Magnetic Cure in January 1902.2 Although the Palmers' relationship was deeply troubled, B. J. always aligned with his father's image. Deferring to D. D. as the \"Founder\" or \"Discover\" of chiropractic, he reserved for himself the role of \"Developer.\" Yet even detractors must acknowledge that, beyond his self-promotion and controversial status in the chiropractic world, B. J.'s management skills were considerable. When financial crises foretold the closing of the institute, B. J. arranged a loan from a man named L. Howard Nutting. Nutting was a close relative of a Palmer School graduate named Willard Carver, who would become a rival to both of the Palmers a few years later.3 In 1902, however, Nutting's support helped B. J. forestall creditors. B. J. advertised the Palmer Institute and Infirmary in regular newspapers. His efforts were rewarded in the matriculation of nine tuition-paying students.4 Early enrollments were tiny, but over time B. J.'s relentless promotion of the college succeeded to an extent that may have surprised even him. The Palmer 110 o n t h e f r o n t i e r o f t h e n e w p r o f e s s i o n School had only twenty-four students in 1906. By 1923, its enrollment exceeded 3,000, placing it among the largest vocational schools in the United States. B. J. showed early potential in navigating opposition from medical authorities. In 1903, he was indicted in Scott County, Iowa for practicing medicine without a license. It is unclear whether, following his indictment, B. J. practiced chiropractic or taught the system at Palmer School.5 The case was delayed through several continuances without a final action, seemingly lost in a backlog; after this incident, B. J. hired a regular physician to oversee the Palmer clinic.6 This helped put the school on a somewhat more solid legal footing. But D. D. did not appreciate these accomplishments. Rather, he viewed B. J.'s actions as presumptuous interference. On arrival in Davenport, he demanded the Palmer School be returned. This tempestuous reconciliation marked the beginning of a forty-month period in which father and son attempted to collaborate in running the Davenport enterprise. In his 1953 report to the profession, Cyrus Lerner used theatrical metaphors to interpret B. J.'s character. Lerner felt that B. J. \"acted\" every one of his major social roles, and that his ability to don various persona was both pathological and the key to his great success. To this end, Lerner portrayed B. J.'s assuming control of the school as an example of his imitating his father. He even parodied B. J.'s takeover of the Palmer School in D. D.'s absence as a stage-play, entitled The Forgotten Year. Between 1903 and 1913, relations between the Palmers constituted \"high drama,\" for which the \"set\" was a critical component. The backdrop of chiropractic was moving, expanding beyond either Palmer's control. In the spring of 1904, B. J. married Mabel Heath at the Methodist Episcopal Church in Davenport. Straight chiropractors remember her as the \"First Lady\" of their profession and for being a tempering force upon her husband. Mabel grew up in Milan, Illinois and had worked in the village post office before moving to Davenport, where she held jobs with the telephone company and as a bookkeeper for a local insurance business.7 After their marriage Mabel enrolled in Palmer School and began to assist B. J. in its operation, both as an administrator and as a caregiver for the infirmary inpatients. On earning her DC (Doctor of Chiropractic), Mabel apparently studied for a time at Rush Medical College in Chicago, though this cannot be confirmed. Years later, B. J.'s description of his wife's medical training damned her with the praise that \"twelve years ago Mrs. Palmer spent a year in Chicago, alternating between 10 and 12 of the best medical universities and dissecting rooms.\"8 With or without a medical degree, Mabel Heath Palmer became the lead anatomy teacher at Palmer School. o n t h e f r o n t i e r o f t h e n e w p r o f e s s i o n 111 Mabel Heath Palmer. Archives, David D. Palmer Health Sciences Library/Palmer College of Chiropractic. Mabel's moderating influence was not sufficient to keep the Palmers' familial difficulties from becoming apparent. D. D.'s grandson David Palmer noted that within a few months of D. D.'s return to Davenport, he moved a considerable distance away to Letts, Iowa.9 How long he stayed there is unclear, for during most of 1904 and 1905 both Palmers spent much of their time in the Quad-Cities area. Father and son copublished a new periodical named The Chiropractor in 1905. The Palmers seemed never to have fully agreed, however, on which one was in authority at the chiropractic school. Their rivalry was manifest in the fact that the Davenport Democrat and Leader referred to both D. D. and B. J. as president of the chiropractic school\u2014within the same article.10 fa c t i o n a l i s m a n d t h e s e c o n d c h i r o p r a c t i c t h e o r y Between 1902 and 1906, a number of former students of the Palmers began to establish themselves as independent chiropractic leaders. Present-day chiropractors remember these figures as \"pioneers,\" using that metaphor quite 112 o n t h e f r o n t i e r o f t h e n e w p r o f e s s i o n often but perhaps forgetting how conflict-ridden a frontier environment can be. By necessity, building the social infrastructure for a new profession is a collaborative process, but contests for authority in the chiropractic movement meant it was spun by both centrifugal and centripetal forces. While early chiropractors were often locked in battles for proper credit that may appear petty to us now, they understood that the true \"discoverer\" of chiropractic and theorists who presented chiropractic theories most accurately (i.e., \"scientifically\") would be recognized as leaders in the profession. Willard Carver, himself one such contender, made the acute observation that, \"the founder of each school imagined that he must be the author or inventor, or at least he must claim to be, of a new set of ideas explaining the cause of disease and its correction, and a new series of 'moves' by which to accomplish correction.\"11 Credit for chiropractic ideas became a means to social power. The struggle between the Davenport-based Palmers and Solon Langworthy and the other American School chiropractors in Cedar Rapids was especially important. Both the Palmers and American School chiropractors held self-serving conceptions of chiropractic theory as proprietary knowledge from which they felt entitled to reap rich rewards. Langworthy and his associates alternately understood chiropractic as intellectual property to which they claimed ownership or as \"scientific knowledge\" to be impartially shared with the world. While D. D. still was on the West Coast, Solon Langworthy started to build his practice in Cedar Rapids. In 1904 Langworthy reorganized his proprietary medical college and renamed it the \"American School of Chiropractic and Nature Cure.\" Langworthy was joined in this endeavor by two other former students of D. D. Palmer: Oakley G. Smith and Minora Paxson. All three were committed to incorporating other treatment modalities; this conviction shaped not only the training institute they founded, but the entire chiropractic profession.12 Langworthy and his associates sought to advance the scientific standing of chiropractic. The full name of the American School of Chiropractic and Nature Cure reflected its openness to the health reform movement. \"Nature Cure\" was a synonym for naturopathy, an up-and-coming system created around 1895 by a German immigrant named Benedict Lust who had at one time trained as an osteopath.13 While resembling chiropractic in its use of vertebral vitalism, naturopathy incorporated most nineteenth century healing alternatives into its therapeutic repertoire, including dietary reform, \"hygienic\" living, botanic medicine, and Mental and Metaphysical healing. All these treatments were believed to assist the \"healing power of nature.\" From the time of Langworthy's o n t h e f r o n t i e r o f t h e n e w p r o f e s s i o n 113 reorganization of the American School into the 1930s, cooperation between naturopaths and chiropractors was very common. D. D. Palmer is reported to have derided Langworthy's attempt to align chiropractic with nature cure as \"mixing\" in a letter to B. J.14 This raises an important topic in chiropractic history\u2014the origins of what the profession calls the \"Straight-Mixer Debate.\"15 Even in the early 1900s, chiropractors had various opinions on how to understand and interact with other health systems. The cooperation between chiropractors and other practitioners, their exchange of ideas, and the incorporation of therapies from other systems became hallmarks of the \"Mixer\" faction in chiropractic. In contrast, those chiropractors whose sole focus was spinal adjustment became known as \"Straights.\" At stake were questions about doctrinal purity and the social boundaries of the profession. As with so many issues in chiropractic, this debate looms large inside the profession while going unnoticed outside the chiropractic world. Today, the majority of practitioners deploy other treatments, with vitamin therapy being probably the most common adjunct modality. Few Mixer chiropractors use the term anymore. Today, one is more likely to hear this side described as \"holistic,\" \"wellness-oriented,\" or \"integrative\" practitioners. On the other hand, Straight chiropractic has proven a hardy survivor as a minority faction of chiropractic purists with a highly spiritualized understanding of the practice. The formation of the American School was the first of several bold moves by Langworthy and his Cedar Rapids associates. In 1903, they started a journal entitled Backbone, which they sold on subscription, and individually for 5 cents a copy.16 Backbone tells as much about its authors' worldview as D. D.'s advertorials do about his. Furthermore, the content of the journal is critical to understanding the conflict between the Palmers and the American School chiropractors, a distant, rocky terrain that is difficult to chart. Langworthy's presentation of chiropractic minimized D. D.'s contribution. In the very first issue of Backbone, the practice was described as \"an original Iowa idea,\" without any specific reference to D. D.17 Langworthy argued that D. D. Palmer had not created chiropractic but had stolen it from osteopathy, magnetic healing, and other systems. He and his associates would go on to create a new origin story for chiropractic to counteract the Palmers' mythologized \"Lillard Incident.\" In \"How Old is Chiropractic,\" a graduate of the American School named Carroll Whitney Burtch explained that spinal adjustment was a piece of practical health wisdom with several centuries of folk practice behind it that had evolved, seemingly organically, in several locations starting in the mid-nineteenth century. The article contained 114 o n t h e f r o n t i e r o f t h e n e w p r o f e s s i o n a detailed lineage that selectively gave credit for important contributions to the emergence of c hiropractic. The subsection \"Forty Years Ago\" presented the tale of \"Mr. Bradford,\" who claimed to have been cured of kidney disease through spinal manipulation in the early 1860s in New York. This account challenged the Lillard Incident's status as the first chiropractic adjustment.18 Like many of Backbone's writers, Burtch maintained that chiropractic adjustments most closely resembled an Eastern-European practice of bodily manipulation. The American School chiropractors named their antecedent \"Napravit\" or \"Napravivani,\" and maintained it had been introduced to the Iowa towns on the Mississippi by a Bohemian immigrant doctor named Frank Dvorsky.19 This origin story was picked up by other chiropractors, and even reprinted in some medical journals, but Napravit does not seem to have been a developed treatment system. In Czech, the word \"napravit\" means \"repair\" or \"fixing,\" and Slavic immigrants from Eastern Europe may have used this term to describe lay bodywork practices. Regardless, Burtch's assertion reduced D. D.'s role to giving the chiropractic profession its name and opening the first training institute. The text then made veiled reference to the Palmer School's suspended operations, so as to reinforce the uniqueness of the American School. From D. D.'s perspective, this depiction would seem greatly unfair. Like so much early chiropractic writing, Burtch's account is a partisan blend of misrepresentation and truth. Disentangling these threads is difficult, but necessary for weaving a historical record. For example, Burtch's evaluation of the Palmer School is a rare corroboration of a claim made by investigator Cyrus Lerner: that after B. J. was arrested for practicing medicine without a license, he had stopped both treating patients and teaching chiropractors. Lerner insisted that until D. D. returned from California, the Davenport venture had largely shut down, calling the period from 1903 to 1904 \"The Forgotten Year.\"20 The possibility that Palmer School suspended operations has bearing on the Palmer-Langworthy rivalry, but I can neither verify nor disprove Lerner's charge. But by July 1904, Langworthy was calling the American School \"the first organized school of Chiropractic.\"21 There were reasons beyond financial self-interest for the American School chiropractors to distance themselves from figures like D. D. Palmer. Backbone reflected their ambitious attempt to redefine chiropractic for a more \"modern\" world. It is no coincidence that one of the advertisements in Backbone made a direct appeal to \"Progressive Men and Women.\" Langworthy and his associates offered a developed chiropractic theory, predicated on a single idea: \"The fundamental principle of Chiropractic is that 'the nerves are the o n t h e f r o n t i e r o f t h e n e w p r o f e s s i o n 115 life,' and that disease is the result of pinched nerves.\"22 In Backbone, Langworthy aligned chiropractic fully with the vertebral-vitalist paradigm, but with a new twist. The concept of the spinal column as a life-giving conduit for the whole body was preserved, but described using then-current medical terminology: From the spinal cord, branch nerves supply all parts and organs of the body, passing between the vertebrae, through clean-cut little openings called 'intervertebral foramina,' or windows. Chiropractic investigation has shown that right here is found the cause for nearly all the ills with which man is afflicted; sub-luxations of the vertebrae are found wherever a condition of disease exists. It is a notable fact that these spinal irregularities are always where they contract the intervertebral openings and bring an unnatural pressure upon the nerves which supply the parts or the organ where the symptoms of disease manifest themselves. The skilled Chiropractitioner, knowing every articulation, and prominence, familiar with the many and complicated inter-relations among the ligaments, tissues, fibres, and tendons by which the spinal column is held together, knows just what to do, and when, where and why to do it. He reduces the luxation, releases the nerve from the strangling pressure which has been preventing it from doing its duty, it resumes business, the disease is ousted and health returns.23 American School chiropractic theory reflected a subordination of modern medical knowledge to the logic of nineteenth-century popular physiology. It grafted scientific ideas onto the vertebral vitalist paradigm, but the roots of the original tree stayed strong. For example, the brain was not only a critical organ, it was the source of \"brain and nerve substance,\" identified as the true agent of bodily vitality.24 Modern anatomy also gave Langworthy a new source for the \"obstructions\" that nineteenth-century vitalists held were the internal causes of disease. \"Sub-luxations\" were partial, often quite subtle, dislocations of the vertebrae, which were thought to press upon the spinal cord and affect the circulation of \"nerve substance.\" Happily for patients not versed in medical terminology, Langworthy was able to reduce this theory to laymen's terms that will strike many readers as familiar: \"The nerves are the life. If the nerves are interfered with, life is disturbed. Most of the troubles of life, mental and physical, are caused by pinched nerves, and with almost never an exception the pinch comes from sub-luxated vertebrae.\"25 The theory could simplify one step more, however, so as to satisfy the strongest nature-trusting heretic: \"Chiropractic removes the cause of disease and nature effects the cure.\"26 116 o n t h e f r o n t i e r o f t h e n e w p r o f e s s i o n Something important is going on here. Many chiropractors regard subluxations as the primary source of \"bodily dysfunction,\" which cause or contribute to the exacerbation of most illnesses and medical conditions. Chiropractic adjustments are seen as effective because they restore subluxated vertebrae to their natural positions. In this light, the \"discovery\" of subluxation represents a massive contribution to chiropractic theory. Many popular understandings depict D. D. Palmer as the first one to implicate spinal \"subluxations\" in disease processes, but Langworthy's earlier printed use of the term complicates that assumption. Who, exactly \"discovered\" the subluxation? Today, most chiropractic historians credit Langworthy with translating vitalist ideas about spinal diseases and treatments into the idiom of contemporary anatomy, and with introducing the \"subluxation\" to the chiropractic profession. Langworthy himself, however, acknowledged that the investigations of other healers had come before his own. At least one osteopath preceded Langworthy in publishing a subluxation-based theory of health. Carl Philip McConnell was an early student of A. T. Still. In the 1890s, McConnell taught at the flagship American School of Osteopathy in Kirksville, Missouri; later, he was affiliated with the A. T. Still Research Institute in Chicago. Through his several books and a research focus on the origins and pathways of disease-causing \"bony lesions,\" McConnell became one of the leading authorities on osteopathy in the early twentieth century. The term \"subluxation\" appears several times in McConnell's 1899 book, The Practice of Osteopathy.27 McConnell used \"subluxation\" interchangeably with several other terms: \"dislocation,\" \"derangement,\" and \"lesion.\" He saw \"subluxation\" as a condition that could affect several bodily joints, like the pelvis and, despite the stationary nature of its components, the rib cage. At the same time, believing that \"derangements of the vertebrae cause much, if not most, pathology,\" he accorded special importance to the spinal column.28 Because they interfered with the circulation of \"nerve force\" through the body, spinal injuries were implicated in a host of diseases and conditions, including colds, tuberculosis, diabetes, tonsillitis, appendicitis, heart trouble, kidney failure, emphysema, headache, and polio. McConnell specifically cited \"vertebral subluxations\" as the cause of many illnesses, including dysentery: \"Invariably a lesion of the spinal column is found at the third and fourth lumbar or near by. It is generally a subluxation of a lateral nature between these vertebrae; rarely is the lesion above or below this point. The treatment should be applied immediately and directly to this o n t h e f r o n t i e r o f t h e n e w p r o f e s s i o n 117 region. . . . In many cases to get an anatomically correct spine is an impossibility from the fact that the displacements may be of long standing and naturally the luxated and subluxated vertebrae have conformed themselves to some extent to their unnatural position. In other words, what has been lost in shape and size of a vertebra may have been gained by reducing the effect of the lesion to a minimum. A lesion of this nature at the third lumbar impairs the innervation to the colon and consequently produces a stasis of blood in the mesenteric circulation, followed by inflammation, bloody discharges, cramps, etc.\"29 Vertebral \"subluxations\" also led to bronchitis, pneumonia, neuralgia, chorea, and migraines. Thus the overall paradigm of McConnell's theory oriented to spinal therapeutics: \"In the various diseases of the spinal cord careful and thorough treatment should always be given with a view of correcting abnormal deviations of the vertebrae and ribs, and to separate each vertebra and relax the muscles thoroughly, to relieve impingements of nerve centers and nerves and to influence the circulation of the cord.\"30 The Practice of Osteopathy even \"mapped\" the relation of various organs to the central nervous system, in a table that reaffirmed the nineteenth-century practice of \"spinal charting.\"31 We know D. D. Palmer was familiar with McConnell's work, because he wrote a response to an essay by the osteopath called \"Is Chiropractic a Part of Osteopathy?\"32 Langworthy, however, had even stronger osteopathic connections. Along with attending the Palmer School, he studied at the American College of Manual Therapeutics in Kansas City, Missouri.33 The circle at the American School included several healers with dual training in chiropractic and osteopathy, but Langworthy and his associates felt it was important to keep the systems separate. In Backbone, they called attention to the different principles, treatment methods, and results of each profession. Sometimes their efforts at distancing were more derogatory. An unnamed reviewer of the autobiography of A. T. Still found that \"the book, like the author, is full of original peculiarities and eccentricities. In style its uniqueness falls into a somewhat undesirable class all by itself, strongly marked by irregular English, doubtful grammar and a generally distressing diction. . . . The wit is often clumsy, and the jokes related are apt to smack of brutality. The osteopathic theories are interesting and are ably exploited. While the science of Chiropractic is not more akin to osteopathy than osteopathy is to massage, the writer recognizes the good that is in it as far as it goes, and commends the autobiography of its founder to the attention of those interested in the subject.\"34 118 o n t h e f r o n t i e r o f t h e n e w p r o f e s s i o n Both the Palmers and the American School chiropractors sought to distance chiropractic from osteopathy, but despite all their protests, Still's system does appear to have been a strong source for chiropractic knowledge. The greater point, though, is that virtually every vertebral vitalist concept, term, and treatment technique was shared by practitioners of competing systems, who all proclaimed their uniqueness and disparaged their competition. Publication of chiropractic theory in Backbone provoked a proprietary war over the discovery of chiropractic ideas between the American School and the Palmers. In December 1903, Langworthy introduced readers to another wondrous capacity of the nervous system in an article that included the statement \"The Nerves Maintain Animal Heat.\" As with the introduction of subluxation theory, the timing of this publication is very important: Although D. D. had not written anything about the Santa Barbara Incident, it is said to have occurred six months earlier. Oakley Smith and Minora Paxson were present at the event, and it is plausible to surmise they relayed D. D.'s discovery about the nerves to their new colleague.35 Was Langworthy's observation about the \"calorific\" properties of the nerves a bold attempt to steal D. D.'s thunder? It may have been the innocent expansion of a point D. D. himself had not considered important; his reports about the Santa Barbara Incident were not published for over a year. Furthermore, while Langworthy may have been drawing inappropriately on D. D.'s ideas about the \"calorific\" properties of nerves, evidence tilts in the opposite direction on other questions of originality. One might think of the development of chiropractic theory as a reflexive exchange between the Palmers and the American School chiropractors, to which each group brought ideas and influences from many aspects of popular intellectual culture. For example, the understanding of \"science\" at the American School was sometimes at odds with the views of the professional scientific mainstream. A statement in the April 1904 Backbone indicates the Cedar Rapids chiropractors questioned the germ theory of disease: \"False fears and emotions, not microbes, are the chief causes of epidemics. Fear is a much more contagious disease than small pox.\"36 Langworthy filed patents for several medical devices and used Backbone to promote his weight-loss program, called \"Dr. S. M. Langworthy's Reduction Rules.\" These endeavors place Langworthy in the ranks of Progressive Era health entrepreneurs, but another marks him as having especially grand aspirations. By 1904 Langworthy promised that the adjustment of subluxations could cure the \"disease\" of old age.37 While the American School chiropractors were \"modern\" in their embrace of science, proprietary and populist valences from dissenting o n t h e f r o n t i e r o f t h e n e w p r o f e s s i o n 119 health culture complicated their engagement with modernity, which tends to prefer an open exchange of ideas. This tension was expressed in the material elements of the journal, which was arranged as a booklet. While the cover went through several design changes, it always featured a strikingly positioned image of a skeletal spine. The aesthetics of the journal reveal an important insight about early chiropractic: the presentation was consistently in the Arts and Crafts style. The full title (Backbone: How to Feel Right and Be Well; A Book about Body and Brain Building) appeared in a \"Gutenberg\" typeface like the ones popularized by William Morris in England and the Roycrofters in East Aurora, New York. Covers bore woodcut-style engravings, with ornate, concentric borders and dense foliage of ivy or grapes. For some issues, sprigs of oak twirled across the covers; in others cross-hatching represented the grain of inlaid wood. The design of Langworthy's journal reflects a broader orientation to the Arts and Crafts movement among early chiropractors and many other populist intellectuals. Partly, this was because so many of their projects literally were \"homemade,\" on presses like the one at the Palmer Printery. Even when printing was outsourced, alternative health and spiritual texts carried Arts and Crafts design elements, evident in paper quality, typefaces, and the craftsmanship of manual printing. This was because the style was associated with individualism, authenticity, and resistance against the mass-produced products\u2014and ideas\u2014delivered by the Industrial Revolution. This is especially pronounced in the publications of both D. D. Palmer and B. J., for whom the Arts and Crafts movement took on special meaning, as I discuss in Chapter Five. In many ways, Backbone resembled D. D.'s advertorials, beyond their shared genre of promotional health literature. In addition to explaining chiropractic theory, they both included many testimonials of patient healings. Across the Backbone letters, one detects a \"plain folk\" vernacular, employed to communicate a high moral drama. The accounts of progression from illness to health reverberated with the dramatic pitch of narratives of religious redemption. Their conversion to the \"truth\" of chiropractic brought restoration of the physical body, which was implicitly compared to the experience of spiritual rebirth. This theme is dramatically illustrated in the short letter, \"Given Up to Die From Gall Stones.\" F. M. Goldsberry of Marion, Iowa wrote: My restored good health remains unimpaired and my faith in Chiropractic is increased beyond what it was at first, if such were possible. My mother, now seventy-seven years of age, is spared to us 120 o n t h e f r o n t i e r o f t h e n e w p r o f e s s i o n because of Chiropractic and its scientific, successful employment by Dr. Langworthy. Chiropractic saved her, after she had been given up by several of the very best doctors in this country. It was last April. She was suffering from gall stones and each subsequent attack was worse than those which had preceded it, the suffering and agony when it seemed nothing could give relief, and death itself might be a blessing, we called Dr. Langworthy, and within ten minutes the pain was gone, and those about the bedside stood in wondering amazement. The services of Dr. Langworthy were continued for seven weeks and the result was a perfect restoration to health. My mother has never had a return of her trouble and our testimony, as here given, but poorly tells what we feel.38 Unlike the Palmers' publications, Backbone carried advertisements from both commercial businesses and practitioners of other alternative health systems. The very first issue printed announcements for books on etiopathy, naturopathy, and a magazine on mental healing. Before long it ran advertisements for many different health options: wonder-working grape juice, electrotherapeutic devices, macerated wheat. In contrast, D. D. carried virtually no outside advertising, though he continued to list prices for goldfish and supplies through many years of advertorials. Their different uses of advertising points to a major separation in outlook between the Davenport and Cedar Rapids chiropractors. The Palmers maintained a proprietary stance toward chiropractic knowledge, and they sought to keep the profession pure from the influences of other health systems. In contrast, the American School wanted to establish comity with both scientific and alternative medicine, believing cooperation would yield greater advantages than defensive, private ownership. Later issues of Backbone added promotions for the Stone School of Scientific Physical Culture, the Schaefer System of Healing, Professor L. A. Vaught's Successful Self-Confidence Guide, and an advertisement for a home-study course in \"Duttonism\"\u2014a form of occult telepathy. With the third issue, Langworthy announced a subscription agreement with the producers of many popular magazines and the comity with rival health systems rose to a new level. Subscribers could attain discounts and special offers by ordering Backbone in conjunction with mainstream publications like Harper's Magazine, Scientific American or Ladies Home Journal. Subscribers also could order Backbone with Metaphysically-oriented periodicals, including Suggestion, Nautilus, and the Self-Instructor in Phrenology. o n t h e f r o n t i e r o f t h e n e w p r o f e s s i o n 121 More important than the advertisements, Backbone contained many articles on Metaphysical spirituality. A figure named \"Arba Josef\" contributed a vindication of the New Thought movement to the very first issue.39 Throughout its run, Langworthy's journal maintained an active engagement with Harmonial therapeutics. Following the common practice of reprinting essays by other writers, Backbone introduced readers to the ideas of Christian Science healer Francis Edgar Mason, who asserted that \"thought vibrations\" had the potential to affect reality: \"Man is the vitalizer of all the cosmic principles, and by correspondence of thought he has the power of deciding just what shall be in his own environment. The kingdom of heaven is within, and it is externalized by mentally dwelling upon the heavenly or harmonious conditions until they become actual verities in our life.\"40 Some pieces appear to have been specifically written for Backbone, like the contribution by popular writer Nancy McKay Gordon. Among other points confirmed in \"Eternal Unity\" was the core Metaphysical tenet that human beings were manifestations of the divine. \"As this truth dawns upon us the soul realizes its own intimate relationship to the Universe; its divine comradeship with everything in the Universe; thus a spiritual energy takes hold of things and GOODNESS leaps forth into a diviner expression of Life. The ultimate relation out of which grows a supernal consciousness of GOODNESS is this: that not only is Man eternally divine, but that God is eternally human!\"41 Backbone's editors created a community of discourse that drew a direct connection between chiropractic and alternative spirituality. They went so far as to compare the therapeutic responsibilities of chiropractors to the pastoral duties of clergy. One contributor recommended that \"the man or woman who feels fitted to sustain such relations; who is actuated by the highest, noblest impulses to help his fellow man, Should Study Chiropractic.\"42 It is uncertain whether Metaphysical healing was actually taught at the American School, but the spiritual discourse clearly rubbed off on Langworthy's understanding of chiropractic. In an article that appeared in January 1904, he affirmed the idea that the vital principle was a separate force from the conscious mind. He went further by investing the vital principle, or \"life force,\" with an intentional power and singling out the nervous system as the conduit for vitality: Every act of every individual is ordered by one of two distinct and separate intellects, the innate and the educated. These two thinking forces are closely associated and influence each other to a degree determined only by the individual differences of the persons in whom they exist. They are the vital forces\u2014the twin agents of life. 122 o n t h e f r o n t i e r o f t h e n e w p r o f e s s i o n The educated intellect is wholly acquired. It is learned by experience, for the child when born has no educated intellect. The innate intellect is not acquired. It is born within us; it is inherent; it does not require years of observation to learn to run the human body; it is just as intellectual and capable of running all the functions of the body the day we are born as in our adult life. . . . \"Nature,\" \"instinct\" and \"intuition\" are terms often used to convey this idea of innate intellect, but they do not fully convey or express the thought. . . . This innate intellect never sleeps; it runs all the vital functions of our bodies, every minute of our lives, night and day, by and through nerves, which if free to act in a natural manner, would calmly do their work and we would not know an ache or pain or any of the symptoms of disease. The life power or life force would be unobstructed and normal. This innate intellect is the body builder, before and after birth; the educated intellect directs the thoughts that are above and outside the material body. . . . If you would comprehend diseased conditions of the vital organs, study innate nerves. The old 'blood' delusion or the present fad of microbes and bacteria, cannot explain intelligently they unpleasant sensations of nerves. . . . Innate intellect does not study the laws of physical mechanics and does not set displaced or fractured bones, but after Chiropractics replace them innate nerves will absorb and remove useless exostoses or other temporary protections which are no longer needed, and put to natural use those nerves which before were useless, or worse than useless.43 In retrospect, these are momentous propositions: the concepts of \"Innate\" and \"Educated Intelligence\" are of crucial importance to the logic of chiropractic healing, which the profession calls \"Chiropractic Philosophy.\" In Straight chiropractic thought, \"Educated Intelligence\" refers to the conscious human mind. It is distinct and usually subordinate to the \"Innate Intelligence\" of the body, which is the Straight chiropractic interpretation of the vital principle. Chiropractors almost unanimously attribute these concepts to the Palmers. In January 1904, however, Langworthy was using the terms with some sophistication and much in the manner of present-day chiropractors. They had not yet appeared in the Palmers' published writings, but they would by the end of the year. o n t h e f r o n t i e r o f t h e n e w p r o f e s s i o n 123 \"Innate\" is an uncommon phrasing for the vital principle. The concept is central to chiropractic, and I'd like to propose some possible origins for the word choice. In Europe between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries, many biologists took language from Isaac Newton's Law of Inertia, the \"innate force of matter,\" to posit a new force in the body\u2014\"Vis Insita\"\u2014that could account for any of several organic phenomena. A second possibility gives credit to Albrecht von Haller, for whom the \"Vis Insita\" was the contractility of muscle fibers, as opposed to the \"Vis Nervosa\" of the nervous system. Though Haller objected to conflating \"Vis Insita\" with vital force, that does not appear to have stopped others from making the association and seeing Haller its source. Over the same stretch of time, philosophers like Ren\u00e9 Descartes and John Locke associated \"innate ideas\" with those aspects of cognition that were \"naturally indwelling.\" By the late nineteenth century, the \"Vis Insita\" was associated with \"vitality,\" both in popular and professional scientific discourse.44 The term maintained its multivocality: simultaneously understood as the principle organizing the material world and the one directing the behavior of living organisms, \"Innate Force\" was invoked to bridge the physical and natural sciences in a way that seems to be replicated in chiropractic logic. More than these distant antecedents, D. D.'s notion of \"Innate Intelligence\" resonated with overtones of Theosophy. Theosophist Helena Blavatsky referred to certain animating forces in the universe as \"Insitas\" (innates). In the 1920s, Gottfried de Purucker reached for the same terminology, writing that \"Theosophy says that everything is radioactive, that is, has at its core or heart an innate force which is its character, that is a force of a particular kind or quality; and it is the pourings forth of these forces, each of its own particular kind or quality, which produce the various phenomena of Nature that we see around us.\"45 There is a prevalent belief among chiropractic historians that D. D. Palmer studied Theosophy independently, like many nineteenth-century American autodidacts. At the same time, the virtual saturation of Backbone with Metaphysical discourse suggests that Langworthy was equally likely to have developed the Innate Intelligence theory. Attending to a Theosophical connection thus does little to clarify the source for chiropractic. Far more than I would like, my observations here remain speculative. In present-day chiropractic there is no single meaning for Innate Intelligence; rather, its definition and qualities are debated. The typical focus of study in Chiropractic Philosophy are questions such as: whether Innate is a mechanical force like gravity or a sentient guiding presence; best likened to a spiritual or nonspiritual force; if spiritual in nature, one that should be 124 o n t h e f r o n t i e r o f t h e n e w p r o f e s s i o n compared to the human soul, to the Holy Spirit, or to another supra-natural reality. Another prominent area of discussion is how and why Innate Intelligence interacts with the \"matter\" of the physical world. This conversation strikingly evokes nineteenth-century discussions about science and religion, especially those in which the concept of a \"Vis Insita\" appear. This is both intentional, as when present day writers make appeals to older authorities, and the result of certain ideas being considered to their logical conclusions, such as the \"purposefulness\" of the life-force. While we may not be able to identify the all of the specific influences on chiropractic theory, we can still discern its general heritage. Innate and Educated\u2014D .D. first printed the signature vocabulary of Chiropractic Philosophy in a new advertorial printed almost a year later, entitled The Chiropractor: A Monthly Journal Devoted to the Interests of Chiropractic.46 The December 1904 issue of The Chiropractor seems to have been the first publication of D. D.'s ideas since he left Davenport in 1902. The Chiropractor was part of D. D. and B. J's attempt to collaborate. Some of the articles were told in the third person, with the elder Palmer as the subject.47 B. J.'s influence was registered in the included announcement that he owned copyright to the publication. His involvement changed the design aesthetics: this new serial was printed in booklet form rather than as a broadside. It held more than a dozen chapters, many of which included short patient testimonials. The Chiropractor also carried advertisements for other companies' products: tooth and baking powders, typewriters, and sectional bookcases.48 Another important change was the reprinting of long quotations from allopathic and osteopathic sources, in a manner consistent with the genre of popular physiology. But the 1904 advertorial's difference from its predecessors went beyond aesthetics. It asserted a revised chiropractic theory, which closely resembled the \"impinged nerve\" theory outlined in Backbone: Ninety-five per cent of all deranged nerves are made by sub-luxations of vertebrae which pinch nerves in some one of the 51 joint articulations of the spinal column. Therefore, to relieve the pressure upon these nerves means to restore normal action\u2014hence, normal functions, perfect health. Chiropractic finds the cause in pinched nerve [sic] of the person ailing, and releases that pressure by adjusting some of the 52 articulations of the vertebral column. In doing this there is no rubbing, slapping, knife, drugs, artificial heat, electricity, magnetism, hypnotism, stretching, or mental treatment, in fact nothing but the adjustment of o n t h e f r o n t i e r o f t h e n e w p r o f e s s i o n 125 the displaced vertebra. This is not done with any surgical appliances nor any apparatus whatever, but simply by the use of the hands. The adjustment is almost instantaneous. The movements are unique and Chiropractic in every respect; no other system has anything similar. Chiropractic is the only system that exactly locates the cause of disease and cures by hand adjusting. A large share of diseases are caused by nerves being impinged in the foramina, which is occluded by the displacement of the vertebra. These vertebrae are replaced by the hands; using the processes as handles.49 Like the American School chiropractors, D. D. and B. J. Palmer focused on the nervous system as a channel for the vital force, and held that the spinal column was the leading site for disease-causing obstructions, here identified as \"sub-luxations.\" The similarities between the Palmers' and Langworthy's theories were too close for coincidence. D. D. insisted that the ideas originated with him alone. The Palmers used The Chiropractor to consolidate their version of key chiropractic doctrines, in hope of reasserting their dominance in their fledgling profession. They were on the defensive in this periodical, and their insistence on being the \"Fountain Head\" of chiropractic wisdom needs to be seen in that light: Chiropractic Defined. HISTORICAL Chiropractic was discovered by D. D. Palmer, of Davenport, Iowa, in September 1895. From that time he has developed it into a well defined science that has no resemblance what ever to any therapeutical method. The cures are made by adjustments that are unique and unlike any movements used by any other school. Chiropractic as defined by the discoverer and developer: All acts or movements of any or all parts of the body (including the circulation of the fluids) whether normal, in excess, or a lack of, are but the functions of nerves. There is not an ache or pain, but that are the sensations of deranged nerves. Every act and thought is controlled by Innate and educated nerves; they are the life of the body. The body is heat by calorific nerves, whether the heat is furnished in normal quantity as in health, or in abnormal amounts as in so-called fevers, which is but excessive heat, whether in a part or the whole of the body. 126 o n t h e f r o n t i e r o f t h e n e w p r o f e s s i o n We are in health when the innate and educated nerves are free to act natural. Disease is a condition caused by nerves being excited or depressed, deranging their functions. Innate nerves run all the vital functions of innervation, assimilation, circulation and respiration when we are asleep or awake. Dreams, whether remembered or not, are sensations of the innate nerves. All diseases are but the result of deranged nerves. Ninety-five per cent of these are caused by vertebral luxations which impinge nerves. These displacements may be caused by accidents while we are awake or asleep, or by poisons from decaying animal or vegetable matter, whether taken in by inhalation, food, drink, or by the outrageous practice of the physician who inserts vaccine poison in a healthy body. Chiropractors use the long bones and processes as handles to adjust these displacements; by so doing, we release pinched nerves.50 Seeking to distinguish their enterprise from the American School, the Palmers promoted their unique ability to impart legitimate training, advising prospective chiropractic students to \"remember this fact, when you learn Chiropractic from anyone else outside of the discoverer and developer, you get it at least second-handed, and perhaps third, fourth, fifth, or possibly not at all, as some have learned in their sorrow.\"51 Their attacks on Langworthy even took the form of direct insults, perhaps intended to register as humorous with readers: \"Bro. L., . . such a bungling throat punch that an Osteopath would be ashamed to use it.\"52 The 1904 advertorial preserved some items from previous incarnations. These bear the marks of substantial revisions and show how a focus on nerves was read back into D. D. Palmer's earliest practice. In \"Cancers\u2014Their Cause and Cure,\" D. D. now omitted all mention of trapped blood vessels. Instead, the article explained that \"cancers are but the symptoms of impinged nerves. . . . Cancers are the result of nerves being impinged in the foramen.\"53 The report on the Lillard Incident also was revised, to highlight the intentionality and systematic analysis with which D. D. approached the case.54 In contrast, some earlier versions presented the Lillard adjustment as serendipitous, with the \"First Adjustment\" being a jocular swat on the back using a book. In comparison to Langworthy, D. D. relied more heavily on the idioms of nineteenth-century popular physiology. One example is his continued deployment of \"derangement\" as a cause of illness: \"deranged nerves performing functions in excess, or a deficiency.\"55 Nineteenth-century medical o n t h e f r o n t i e r o f t h e n e w p r o f e s s i o n 127 D. D. Palmer\u2014the \"Chiropractic Fountain-Head.\" In 1904, the back cover of The Chiropractor showed the Palmers seeking to establish their family authority in a competitive arena of proprietary healers. Like many of their rivals, they adopted Arts and Crafts print styles, signaling their populist affinities. Archives, David D. Palmer Health Sciences Library/Palmer College of Chiropractic. discourse also stands behind D. D.'s understanding, here, of \"Innate\" and \"Educated.\" In their early work, both the Palmers and Solon Langworthy understood Innate as a specific set of nerves in the body and also as the life principle carried in those nerves. In the 1904 Chiropractor, D. D. did not discuss Innate and Educated \"Intelligences,\" although those ideas would figure strongly in the Palmers' subsequent writings. Rather, he described \"Innate\" as one of several sets of nerves in the body. \"Innate\" corresponded to the autonomic, or \"sympathetic,\" nervous system, which had long held a place of special importance in American popular physiology. In the middle of the nineteenth century, health reformers embraced the ideas of F. J. V. Broussais who, in expanding the potential of the autonomic nervous system had assigned to the \"great sympathetic nerve\" the supreme power over bodily processes. Like Broussais, D. D. noted that the Innate nerves \"run all the vital functions of innervation, assimilation, circulation and respiration when we are asleep or awake.\"56 D. D. also claimed in several articles that the Innate and Educated nerves were joined by third category, known as \"calorific\" or \"thermogenic\" nerves, whose specific tasks were to heat the body and regulate temperature. This point had been raised in Backbone, too, but as with the concept of subluxation, the idea of \"calorific nerves\" had a genealogy before its appearance in early chiropractic. The debate over whether the body was \"heated by nerves\" reverberated with beliefs from popular physiology. Into the nineteenth century, medical thinkers remained unsure how to explain the thermodynamics of the human body. Often temperature was attributed to the circulation of a heat-bearing fluid, which in the 1780s had been given the name \"caloric\" by the French physiologist, Antoine Lavoisier. The discovery of vasodilator nerves by Claude Bernard in 1851 generated a new wave of interest in thermal regulation.57 While it is unclear whether Bernard himself endorsed the idea, in America both mainstream physicians and health reformers interpreted vasodilation to be evidence of a specific set of heat-generating \"calorific\" nerves. In fact, Carl McConnell argued this in The Practice of Osteopathy, making thermogenic neurology one of the beliefs connecting his system with chiropractic.58 The Palmers used The Chiropractor to respond to osteopathy, but they did not engage their rival profession on the point of \"calorific nerves.\" A different target was in their sights when they printed a full account of the Santa Barbara Incident in an article titled, \"Who Discovered that the Body is Heated by Nerves?\": It will be of interest to \"The Chiropractor\" reader to learn how Dr. D. D. Palmer discovered that the body is heated by nerves, and not by blood. o n t h e f r o n t i e r o f t h e n e w p r o f e s s i o n 129 In the afternoon of July 1, 1903, in suite 15 of the Aiken block, Santa Barbara, Cal., D. D. Palmer was holding a clinic. The patient was Roy Renwick of that city. There were present as students, H. D. Reynard, Ira H. Lucas, O. G. Smith, Minora C. Paxson, A. B. Wightman and M. A. Collier, in all told, eight witnesses. The patient, A. R. Renwick, had the left hand, arm, shoulder and on up to the spine, intensely hot. Dr. Palmer drew the attention of the class to the excessive heat condition of the portion named; the balance being normal in temperature. He then gave an adjustment in the dorsal region which relieved the pinched nerve on the left side, also the excessive heat of the left upper limb; but he had thrown the vertebra too far, which had the effect of pinching the nerves on the right side, and immediately causing the upper limb to be excessively hot. He asked the class, \"Is the body heat by blood or by nerves?\" He then left them for two or three minutes. He returned and asked them, \"Is the body heat by blood or by nerves?\" The class unanimously answered \"Nerves.\" Thus was this new thought originated. The above circumstance is substantiated by a letter written that evening to the doctor's son, B. J. Palmer, D.C., also several following letters which further explained that the caloric of the body, whether normal or in excess, was furnished by calorific nerves. These letters were placed with other original writings in one of the ten bound volumes in order to prove the autobiography of Chiropractic from its birth. Here are the original writings which show beyond the shadow of a doubt who originated the principle of Chiropractic. The doctor's son anticipated that some sneak thief would try to appropriate the credit of originality, and would desire to rob his father of the honor justly due him, thus, his reason for compiling his original writings.59 B. J. was swinging for the fences, but there was an ironic twist to his ardent defense of D. D.'s \"honor\"; it was a closely worded rejoinder to a statement by Langworthy from Backbone. In \"Chiropractic Facts,\" Langworthy had asserted that, \"A porch climber is a thief who goes in the front way, and often does so boldly, in the daytime. A plagiarist is a person who publishes in any form the ideas and compositions of another and claims them as his own. He is as bad a sneak thief or worse than the porch climbing sneak thief.\"60 Sneak thief! The language evokes kids fighting in a sandbox, but in the proprietary war for chiropractic preeminence, print culture was the main 130 o n t h e f r o n t i e r o f t h e n e w p r o f e s s i o n theater\u2014as it had been historically for irregular medical rivalries. One can contextualize the Palmer-Langworthy feud with cases like the botanic healers of Columbus, Ohio in the early 1830s. In 1832 Horton Howard, a disaffected Thomsonian sales agent, joined up with eclectic physician Harvey D. Little to publish The Eclectic and Medical Botanist, which gave air to Howard's side of the dispute.61 This prompted Jarvis Pike, a loyalist to Samuel Thomson, to print an opposing newspaper, The Thomsonian Recorder.62 A substantial amount of each paper consisted of attacks and rebuttals against the other. In other respects, the content was quite similar. Botanic medical culture, like chiropractic nearly 100 years later, was intimate and emotionally charged. Despite the intellectual basis and textual expression of their arguments, a personal dimension was behind them. From the Palmer-Langworthy proprietary debates, one sees that early chiropractic theory developed through processes of exchange, refinement, and transmission. The idea that nerves impinged by subluxations cause illness has become known as D. D. Palmer's \"Second Chiropractic Theory.\" It is held as a special point of pride by the Straight chiropractors with strong loyalties to the Palmer brand. Asking whether and how the Palmers developed these ideas is not intended to reduce their reputations as chiropractic pioneers, though that may be an unfortunate effect. Comparison of statements in the Chiropractor and Backbone, suggests there was \"claim-jumping\" on both sides. If we assign points for specific contributions, the score is close: D. D. Palmer scores for the premise of vitalism, the practice of adjustment, and the idea of nerve-driven metabolism. Langworthy earns points for reinterpreting neurocentric vitalism with stronger medical paradigms, and\u2014more importantly\u2014for establishing the subluxation as the source of bodily dysfunction. It is more difficult to referee the chiropractic Intelligences. Both the Palmers wrote at great length about them, but Langworthy\u2014or another figure at the American School\u2014may deserve some measure of credit for developing the vocabulary. fa c t i o n a l i s m i n t h e g r o w t h o f t h e p r o f e s s i o n With the publication of The Chiropractor, D. D. and B. J. began a pushback against the American School that went beyond print. In the spring of 1905, B. J. and Mabel Palmer bought a property on Brady Street, and announced a \"New Home for the Palmer School.\" In late June, they held the first graduation exercises in the new location.63 Yet even while the Palmers' Davenport enterprise was growing stronger, they faced new challenges from their Cedar Rapids rival. o n t h e f r o n t i e r o f t h e n e w p r o f e s s i o n 131 In 1905 Solon Langworthy partnered with a chiropractor named Daniel W. Reisland to found the American Chiropractic Organization.64 It quickly outpaced the Universal Chiropractors Association started by B. J. Palmer, which, although possibly chartered earlier, had yet to build a presence beyond its documents of incorporation. Were either venture to succeed, it would earn the status of national leader in the profession. Langworthy and Reisland then took another bold step in supporting a bill to legalize the practice of chiropractic in Minnesota. Under the proposed legislation, chiropractors who had completed an adequate \"course of study\" would be licensed. For the American School of Chiropractic, this would have been a boon: while the Palmer School still was not equipped to provide the kind of education that would have passed muster, the curriculum at Cedar Rapids had developed into a two-year program aimed at teaching chiropractic from a scientific perspective. Students there were learning Histology, Organic Chemistry, and Anatomy with Dissection.65 In an effort to close off competition from his key rivals, D. D. personally intervened by writing to the Minnesota governor, who used a veto to block the legislation.66 D. D. succeeded by appealing to the issue of \"medical devices\": Langworthy had endorsed a \"traction-table\" that went beyond the scope of the \"hand-fixing\" that was at the heart of chiropractic into the dangerous realm of mechanical equipment. D. D. argued that chiropractic was a form of \"drugless healing,\" and that \"devices\" like Langworthy's \"traction-table\" were an inappropriate addition. D. D. Palmer's undermining of chiropractic licensure can place the \"Discoverer\" in a rather unflattering light, but he accomplished his goal of checking the aspirations of his former student. The veto of the Minnesota bill in 1905 coincided with the closure of Backbone; Langworthy may have overreached in trying to publish a monthly serial and support a legislative initiative in another state. If by the end of 1904 Langworthy appeared ready to run the table, fortune seemed to smile more brightly on the Palmers in 1905; they now held title to the only chiropractic periodical. Fortune, however, is a great deceiver. By fall of 1905, the Palmers found chiropractic facing increasing legal scrutiny, as the profession incurred a series of highly publicized patient deaths. In Los Angeles, D. D.'s friend Thomas Storey was accused of injuring a disabled carpenter who died after treatment.67 Back in Davenport an eighteen-year-old tuberculosis patient named Lucretia Lewis died after spending two days in the Palmer Infirmary.68 It seems D. D. did not cause her death, but the fact that he\u2014an unlicensed practitioner in the eyes of the State Board of Health\u2014filled out the death 132 o n t h e f r o n t i e r o f t h e n e w p r o f e s s i o n certificate prompted an inquest, to which he was subpoenaed. On the stand, D. D. was confrontational, flourishing the cantankerousness esteemed in vernacular culture. To the court's request that he declare his testimony with the words, \"So help me God,\" D. D. quipped, \"I don't want any help from God.\" The courtroom broke into laughter when, asked by the Coroner to explain chiropractic, D. D. replied, \"Now Dr. Lambach, you are seeking to learn something from a 60 cent witness, for which my students pay me $500.00.\" With such remarks, D. D. cultivated the sympathy of a public that was ambivalent about the social hierarchies prevalent in medicine and law. His courtroom behavior was an extreme expression of the cultural dissent of Progressive Era populist resistance. Under oath, Lydia Lewis, the mother of Lucretia, recounted her daughter's long battle with tuberculosis. Rather than blame D. D. Palmer for the death, she stressed that several regular physicians had told her a cure was impossible. That the jury exonerated him probably owed more to her testimony than his own. D. D.'s sarcasm during the inquest helped trigger several additional investigations into his activities, including one from the local coroner accusing him of practicing medicine without a license in the Lewis case. D. D. was indicted on 7 October 1905, and was released on a $500 bail.69 The case would not come up until spring of the following year. In the meantime, D. D. faced another round of public disapprobation. With the medical practice charge still pending, D. D. was once again called before a grand jury in November, when his fourth wife, Avila Palmer, died of morphine poisoning, apparently a suicide.70 These events helped guarantee that D. D.'s trial in spring 1906 would surpass in gravity all his previous encounters with the law. The January 1905, edition of The Chiropractor figured strongly in his conviction, for in it the Palmers claimed that chiropractic could \"cure\" disease.71 Losing, publicly, for perhaps the first time in his life, D. D. refused to pay the fine that would avoid a 105-day sentence. D. D. was determined to be a gadfly to medical professionals, even if it became a source of embarrassment to his family, or detrimental to the chiropractic profession. He cast himself as a prisoner of conscience, granting an interview to the local paper that resulted in a portrait of his life behind bars.72 D. D. was cheerful about his prison experience, presenting it to readers as an opportunity for self-improvement. In fact, he is reported to have been angry when his fifth wife paid the fine a few weeks later.73 D. D.'s release from jail coincided with a major adjustment in his relations with B. J. Both men seemed to have recognized that all of the Palmer School's o n t h e f r o n t i e r o f t h e n e w p r o f e s s i o n 133 present and future assets were at risk. In order to protect these assets from impending litigation, the entire college was transferred to B. J.'s wife, Mabel Heath Palmer, while D. D. was in prison.74 The elder Palmer had agreed to the transfer, but it had unexpected consequences upon his release when B. J. invoked his new right to act as owner by having his father banned from the premises.75 Hoping to salvage what he could from the enterprise, D. D. agreed to a modest buyout by his son. This amounted to a little less than $2,200, plus twelve books from the library, two complete spines from the osteological collection, and some extra vertebrae.76 D. D. seems to have remarried soon after Avila's death. In May 1906 he left Davenport with his fifth wife, the former Mary Hudler, affectionately known as \"Molly.\"77 To be close to D. D.'s brother Thomas, the couple moved to Medford, Oklahoma, where, for a short time, the brothers ran a grocery store.78 D. D.'s departure may have caused B. J. to breathe a sigh of relief, but it was likely short. As the drama of D. D.'s incarceration unfolded, Langworthy, Smith, and Paxson were at work preparing a chiropractic textbook they hoped would become the standard for the profession. Modernized Chiropractic was an ambitious project, whose clinical scope showed how much the profession had changed since the Lillard Incident of 1895.79 The authors offered a sophisticated presentation of their practice, which they defined as \"a system of manual adjustment recognizing the cause of disease to be structural impairment and displacement, and proclaiming the irrefutable truth that the unique movement known as the Chiropractic Thrust is by far the best agency known for producing Spontaneity in impaired tissues which is the most essential factor in making replacement permanent and thus securing normal position, normal tonicity, and normal tension.\"80 This definition is best explained by breaking down its components. The authors of Modernized Chiropractic put forth a distinct understanding of displacement that was musculoskeletal in focus.81 Health and pathology were dependent on the proper pivot points of joints. Subtle disarticulations here too were described as \"subluxations.\" Such subluxations affected surrounding soft tissues in the body, especially the ligaments. Thus the bones could transmit dysfunctional conditions and \"structural impairment\" to other parts of the body. The American School authors explained the efficacy of chiropractic in the return of bones to their proper place and restoring normal tension of ligaments through \"stretching\" and manipulative treatment. They maintained 134 o n t h e f r o n t i e r o f t h e n e w p r o f e s s i o n these acts achieved the free exercise of vital bodily processes. In Modernized Chiropractic the element that set chiropractic apart from all other forms of manipulative therapeutics was the \"Chiropractic Thrust.\" The distinctive chiropractic technique gave the profession a unique therapeutic capability, resting on \"the removal of the cause of disease by the replacement of displaced structures, especially the reduction of subluxations.\"82 Smith, Langworthy, and Paxson maintained a stated commitment to vitalism, identifying \"vital energy\" as \"the connecting link between things living and things dead.\"83 Like some Enlightenment-era vitalists, they seem to have understood the vital force as limited in power and therefore subject to human therapeutic intervention. They wrote, \"Nature's forces may be guided in the right direction or the wrong direction. . . . Mechanical adjustment. . . can forces.\"84 In addition, like many nineteenth-century vitalists they understood the body to contain a finite supply of \"vital energy.\"85 Nonetheless, the American School's theory of healing differed markedly from the therapeutic logic of earlier vitalists. The American School writers sought to incorporate new knowledge of cellular physiology into chiropractic theory. Smith, Langworthy, and Paxson showed their interest in the modern microscopic medical sciences in their understanding of the nervous system.86 They held that the disruption of nervous transmission affected the body at the cellular level. In the face of this knowledge, they insisted, \"The integrity of the nervous system is so necessary to health and an injury to it is so far reaching, that it can be truthfully said, a healthy nervous system means a healthy body.\"87 The primary element of their physiology was a phenomenon they called \"Spontaneity.\" They claimed that the cells in every bodily tissue \"have an inherent power within themselves, often becoming dormant and it is a demonstrable fact that the Chiropractic Thrust is the ideal means of awakening these cells to their individual consciousness by the production of Spontaneity.\"88 \"Spontaneity\" did not refer to a quantifiable \"vital power,\" but rather to a catalyst for an internal bodily reaction. The metaphor that comes to mind most vividly is jump-starting a car. The authors argued the \"Chiropractic Thrust\" was uniquely capable of instigating spontaneous cellular activity, which sometimes was called \"spontaneous regeneration.\" They saw the phenomenon of Spontaneity as specific to joints, but believed its reach went throughout the body. While subluxations generated local and remote pathology, Spontaneity both ameliorated local-joint problems and set in motion processes responsible for healing. By instigating Spontaneity, chiropractic accomplished \"molecular and cellular adjustment.\"89 The American o n t h e f r o n t i e r o f t h e n e w p r o f e s s i o n 135 School chiropractors were seeking new scientific knowledge, and adapting vitalist ideas to what they found. With Modernized Chiropractic, Langworthy and his associates hoped to deliver to the chiropractic profession \"a correct philosophy,\" a \"well developed technique,\" a \"dependable system of diagnosis,\" and a \"reliable and extensive system of correction.\" The book answered all these calls, addressing pathology throughout the body and providing elaborate protocols for treating various ailments. The ambitions of the American School writers were balanced by an ecumenism toward other forms of drugless healing and manipulative therapeutics; this put them on the \"Mixer\" side of the divide in chiropractic. But they were less charitable to the Palmers, giving them almost no credit. This snub was all the more disturbing for the fact that much of Modernized Chiropractic closely resembled ideas also found in D. D.'s writing. Despite the striking similarities, the American School chiropractors disavowed any influences, including that of the Palmers. The preface of Modernized Chiropractic carried a statement testifying to its plenary originality, claiming the ideas in the book had never before been uttered: We realize that nine-tenths of the terms employed and which are necessary in perfectly expressing the new ideas herein advanced are new as combined and applied to Chiropractic and consequently unfamiliar to those now in the profession, with the exception of those who have been our students. Ideas, like children, are named when born, and as this work teems with new names it is unnecessary to emphasize that with the exception of the Bohemian movement the ideas advanced and facts reported are in the overwhelming majority of instances the result of our own research. When the ideas herein presented are recognized by the profession at large Chiropractors will have received as a result of this work a veritable language for the interchange of Chiropractic ideas and if this one feature were all this work contained its value would be sufficient to command the attention of the profession.90 The assertiveness of this text shows the readiness of the American School chiropractors to challenge the Palmers' domination. Beyond words, however, the actual power of Langworthy and his associates was very much on the wane. In fact, by the time Modernized Chiropractic was published, the leadership of the American School was disbanded. Early chiropractic was fragile, but the profession had a deep bench for active players aspiring to leadership. Other Palmer graduates were making the transition from students to competitors. 136 o n t h e f r o n t i e r o f t h e n e w p r o f e s s i o n Though now located in Lombard, Illinois, the National College of hiropractic began in Davenport in 1905, when a middle-aged man from Utah C enrolled in the Palmer School. A Latter-day Saint, John F. A. Howard had been a missionary to Germany and a salesman for the Latter-day Saints' emporium, the Zion's Cooperative Mercantile Institute. After graduating from Palmer in 1906, he was invited to stay on as an instructor but soon left, seemingly due to disagreements with B. J. He may have been calling for the introduction of cadaver dissection, which B. J. opposed. A past president of the National College claimed it was because a patient in the infirmary requested that Howard treat her instead of B. J.91 From its inception, National sought the integration of chiropractic with other treatments, just as the American School had. The National School of Chiropractic was based in Davenport through the end of 1907, when Howard moved it to Chicago, where it became known for its correspondence courses and recognition of both regular and alternative medicine. In the battles that separated chiropractic factions on therapeutic lines, the National College of Chiropractic became the stronghold of the \"Mixers.\" John Howard was not the only close associate to leave the Palmers' domain in 1906. Willard Carver had served as D. D. Palmer's attorney, even defending him in the Lucretia Lewis case.92 In 1905 Carver attempted to introduce \"suggestive therapeutics\" into the Palmer curriculum, so as to align chiropractic with \"mental therapeutics\" and psychosomatic medicine. The Palmers' hostility to this proposal led Carver to study chiropractic under Charles Ray Parker, yet another recent Palmer graduate.93 Carver took his degree from the Parker School of Chiropractic in Ottumwa, Iowa in 1906.94 Later that year, he opened the Carver-Denny Chiropractic College in Oklahoma. While Howard sought to align chiropractic with other health professions, Carver saw the emerging field of mental health as an opportunity for collaboration. He may have been inspired by transitions under way at the Weltmer Institute, where magnetic healing was being merged with hypnosis and psychotherapy. Carver's development of applied psychology was one of the earliest adaptions of chiropractic theory to the mind-body theories common in holism. Like the Palmers, Carver was open to Metaphysical chiropractic theories, but he believed the practice had evolved since its creation, and therefore downplayed the influence of D. D.'s discovery: I desire to say that in 1895 the first steps in this direction were taken and the first adjusting by specific intention was performed. Other adjustings followed upon the first, and a system of adjusting has been improvised. That system has been added to, developed and expanded until it is no longer a simple system of adjusting, but that system of o n t h e f r o n t i e r o f t h e n e w p r o f e s s i o n 137 adjusting is incident to a science so comprehensive as to substantially include all others. The name Chiropractic has been given to this Science and System of Adjusting. The Science of Chiropractic includes all of the principles of suggestion; it teaches the adjustment of the physical into harmonious relationship with the Soul, and is therefore, the link of union between the unseen force and the seen material, the Soul and the Body. This has never been accomplished before and, therefore, Chiropractic stands today the peerless leader.95 Carver's relations with D. D. remained cordial enough for him to hire his mentor as an instructor after D. D. left the Palmer School. D. D. did not stay long before leaving to collaborate with Alva Gregory, whom Carver had trained. But while on faculty at Carver-Denny, D. D. taught Tullius F. Ratledge, who graduated Carver-Denny in 1907 and opened a school in Oklahoma in 1908. Three years and several failed proprietary institutes later, Ratledge opened a chiropractic school in Los Angeles that would grow into the Los Angeles College of Chiropractic.96 The pattern of leadership in chiropractic education was starting to resemble the dance steps of the Virginia reel, with partnerships changing and figures moving up in rank before being cast aside. Such relocations and realignments suggest the young profession was a complex interpersonal world, but these rivalries helped chiropractic to spread beyond the Midwest into other parts of the United States. The Palmer-Gregory collaboration withered quickly on the vine, but it repeated a pattern of D. D.'s associates becoming his competitors. Within a few years, Alva Gregory had teamed up with a popular and controversial neurologist named Albert Abrams, who in 1910 began marketing a treatment he called Spondylotherapy.97 Four years later, Gregory published a short book called Spondylotherapy Simplified.98 For both Abrams and Gregory, spinal adjustment was best performed using a small hammer to \"tap\" vertebrae into place. Yet their partnership, too, was short-lived. By 1916, Abrams had moved on to new ideas, arguing the human body radiated vibratory energy at the molecular level. He was soon selling a machine called the Dynamizer to read and regulate this force.99 This was followed by another product\u2014the \"Oscilloclast.\" By the time he died in 1924, Abrams had become a national symbol of fraudulent health devices\u2014no one for chiropractors to claim as a kindred spirit. Even so, many chiropractors who use \"Activator\" percussion methods regard Spondylotherapy as a precursor to their practice. 138 o n t h e f r o n t i e r o f t h e n e w p r o f e s s i o n the science of chiropractic It is not clear whether the Palmers foresaw the collapse of the American School in 1906, but after the publication of Modernized Chiropractic, B. J. felt great pressure to produce a comparably authoritative book on chiropractic. He scrambled to collate his father's writings, and within weeks published them as The Science of Chiropractic. D. D. reportedly was infuriated by the unauthorized use of his work, but still acknowledged the ideas as his own. Although the Palmers did not collaborate in the production of the book, we can think of its contents as the joint product of father and son\u2014though one might wonder why either would want to take credit. The Science of Chiropractic was a haphazard compilation of articles, some really in draft form, exceeding 400 pages. Alongside newer case studies and patient testimonials, the volume reproduced stock pieces from the advertorials, such as \"Cancers\u2014Their Cause and Cure.\"100 In addition to the 400 pages of text, the book included over a hundred illustrations, many of which were photographs of D. D. or B. J. administering chiropractic adjustments. It is painful to admit that the Palmers' first book lacked the sophistication of the American School textbook. Nonetheless, The Science of Chiropractic exemplifies the populist intellectual culture of the period. Both D. D. and B. J. embraced \"simplified spelling\" and the text included words like \"thot\" and \"thru.\" Structurally, they interspersed presentations of chiropractic theory with aphorisms, jokes, and occasional bits of verse. It was common in the nineteenth century for writers to include supporting materials such as personal correspondence and quotations from other sources, and such materials also found their way into the Palmers' book. The Palmers' engagement with popular physiology was reflected in the authorities cited. A surprising portion of the supporting medical literature was quite old. D. D. most frequently cited Robley Dunglison, who was among the most widely-read medical writers in nineteenth century America.101 Following the precedent set by irregular medical literature, The Science of Chiropractic referenced and quoted eighteenth- and nineteenth-century stalwarts like Jean-Louis Petit, Charles Bell, and Astley Cooper.102 The Palmers might not deserve full credit for compiling all these excerpts. Some, like a New York Journal of Medicine article from 1852, almost certainly were chosen by D. D.103 And B. J. probably was responsible for the information on bone setting, including a letter addressed to him from medical historian Alexander Wilder about the Sweet family of \"Natural Bone Setters.\"104 Other medically oriented content, however, may have been the contribution of o n t h e f r o n t i e r o f t h e n e w p r o f e s s i o n 139 an associate. A chiropractor named G. H. Patchen is believed to have collated the anatomy sections of D. D.'s later book, The Chiropractor's Adjuster, published in 1910. The Palmers probably received similar help in creating The Science of Chiropractic. Therefore, it is important not to overestimate the medical knowledge of either Palmer on the basis of these documents, though B. J.'s decision to print them and D. D.'s acceptance of ownership as author strongly suggest they agreed with the views outlined in the quoted texts. Both Palmers were highly ambivalent about mainstream science. They aspired to be counted as equals, as evidenced by their citing regular medical sources. Their opposition to professional medicine seems also to have directed them to offer opposing scientific theories on some of the leading questions of the day. In writing attributable to them, the Palmers were hostile to the germ theory of disease. They argued that germs were \"natural scavengers\" which fed off bodily wastes.105 The buildup of internal toxins from subluxations led to blooms in their numbers. Microbiologists thus erred in thinking of these scavengers as causal. Rather, one of the Palmers complained, \"Bacteriologists are examining effects.\"106 D. D. also believed chiropractic was superior to hypnosis and mental healing. He wrote, \"The mind has an influence over the body, and so have various remedies; but when adjusting vertebrae, or other joints, we do not need to use either.\"107 The issue was raised most strongly in D. D. Palmer's dealings with colleague-turned-rival Willard Carver, whose flirtation with suggestive therapeutics D. D. considered apostasy.108 \"Suggestion,\" D. D. Palmer concluded, \"has never had any existence except as a mental delusion.\"109 The Palmers' known hostility to anyone whose project too closely resembled chiropractic makes their reaction to one rival stand out. The Science of Chiropractic reprinted multiple excerpts from the Journal of Scientific Adjustment, published by E. Ellsworth Schwartz of Coldwater, Michigan, who probably studied with the Palmers in Davenport.110 D. D. corrected Schwartz on many small points. Overall, however, the Palmers agreed with the Michigan chiropractor enough to use his text to represent their own ideas. In The Science of Chiropractic, the Palmers argued that the chiropractic replacement of bones removed material barriers to the free exercise of the vital principle within the human body. This idea was not a simple \"starvation\" theory. The obstructions to nerves caused by subluxations could either deprive or over-stimulate parts of the body\u2014the latter by the buildup of vital forces, which induced inflammation or other morbid conditions. Most significantly, the equation of Innate and Educated Intelligence with sets of nerves changed. D. D. Palmer now saw Innate Intelligence as the key 140 o n t h e f r o n t i e r o f t h e n e w p r o f e s s i o n to human life, a force that moved through the nervous system so as to communicate with the whole body and \"regulate its functions.\" This perspective assigned all healing power to Innate. Innate was autonomous and distinct from the conscious mind, which D. D. gave the contrasting name of \"Educated Intelligence.\" D. D. invoked the same paradigm Langworthy had outlined in January 1904 when he wrote, \"Each individual has two distinct and separate intellects, the Innate and the Educated. These thinking forces existing in the same body are very closely associated and influence each other. The Educated intelligence is wholly acquired\u2014learning by experience. The Innate is not acquired. It is born within and with us, and is just as capable of running all functions of the body at birth as in adult life. It is not obtained by experience, but is inherent.\"111 The preceding excerpt contains passages that are nearly verbatim reproductions of text from Backbone. For any number of reasons, D. D.'s full views on Innate Intelligence may simply not have been printed in The Chiropractor. It would be in character for D. D. to be secretive, but one wonders why, if Innate and Educated were important, D. D. did not respond to Langworthy's appropriation of them, as he did to the issue of \"heat by nerves.\" D. D. clearly embraced a Metaphysical vertebral vitalism before the American School writers published their erudite rendition of the same ideas, but I think we must seriously entertain the possibility that D. D. appropriated Langworthy's wording. Even so, Langworthy did not maintain an allegiance to the ideas of Innate and Educated. By 1906, the Intelligences no longer played a role in his theories, which had turned to the phenomenon of Spontaneity. In contrast, the concepts became massively important for the Palmers, who used them to formulate an entire worldview, in which Innate connected structural anatomy to Harmonial spirituality. In The Science of Chiropractic, D. D. explained, \"Chiropractors have learned that all sensations are of nerves, even the circulating fluids are under their control, that Innate Intelligence reaches all parts of the body thru the functions of nerves. This reasoning mind, called nature, instinct, subconscious mind, intuition, soul or spirit, so far as we know, has always existed, and will continue to exist throughout eternity. It is transmitted from the mother to her offspring. Educated Intelligence is created during life. It ceases to exist as an entity at death, but Innate carries with it all the knowledge impressed upon it by education.\"112 Throughout his turbulent life, D. D. scorned institutions and clergy, but he clearly thought a great deal about religious questions. This thinking would come to full fruition in the book he published in 1910, The Chiropractor's Adjuster, but even in 1906 he observed, \"Man is a dual entity. He is composed of the mortal, and o n t h e f r o n t i e r o f t h e n e w p r o f e s s i o n 141 immortal\u2014the everlasting\u2014that which always existed, and always will.\"113 In seeing Innate Intelligence as the \"soul or spirit,\" D. D. followed a longstanding tendency in vitalist thought, but his attention to the physical components of the central nervous system and the psychological dimensions of consciousness both position him in the early twentieth century: Innate is not the mind, the thinking quality with which we are familiar. The functions of the brain, upon which the mind depends for outward expressions, are like other functions, under the control of Innate. IT is behind thot and expresses itself by that means. It can set aside for consideration, the sensations, emotions, passions, desires, or any other mental phenomena, or physiological functions, and thereby receive educational impressions thru it. Innate is self-existent, remains unchanged, is not a part of mental or physical manifestation; but instead controls these, when not hindered by diseased conditions, caused by displacements of the skeletal frame. The brain does not create the mind any more than the rose does its color and odor. The attributes of the mind are under Innate's control. Its quality and characteristic attainments are not a part of it. It is the director of intelligence, is not its slave, but its master. The brain is a medium thru which Innate manifests itself. This intelligence pervades the universe. Each being is a branch\u2014you may call this universal intelligence God, if you choose.114 The lowercase use of the words \"universal intelligence\" here was significant. Over time, the Palmers' understanding of the \"Intelligences\" proceeded into a tripartite system of Innate, Educated, and Universal Intelligence. In his later work, D. D. Palmer settled on the term \"Universal Intelligence\" to represent the divine power of the cosmos, which was microcosmically reflected in the Innate Intelligence of the human being. Together, these three Intelligences would form the basis of D. D.'s final Chiropractic Philosophy, and express a distinct relationship between God and humanity. In The Science of Chiropractic, however, Universal Intelligence is scarcely mentioned, notwithstanding the previous passage. This is but one example of how his theories and terminology were still in formation. D. D. was aware of the metaphysical trajectory of his ideas, but he was not always certain whether and how to integrate them into chiropractic theory. He cautioned readers, \"When I explain the cause of disease I use bones to show material joints which impinge nerves, that are thereby materially 142 o n t h e f r o n t i e r o f t h e n e w p r o f e s s i o n injured and their functions deranged; the results we name disease. When I go into the realms of etherial and spiritual, which cannot be demonstrated, but must be accepted on belief, then I am not in the field of Chiropractic.\"115 At the same time, he did use explicitly religious language to make his point that Innate Intelligence was an indwelling power, divinely bestowed: Do you believe in a supreme being? Do you believe in a perfect supreme being? Do you believe that this perfect supreme being could do an imperfect thing? Could you suggest one thing that He does that could be improved? Could you suggest an improvement that could be added to a new born babe? Does man make a single article, tool, instrument, etc., perfect, or does he add one improvement after another? Innate is perfect, makes perfect bodies, trees, bushes, animals, in fact, all that which has life in the handiwork of Him. These objects are perfect, complete, at time of birth, if anything were added it would be a drag; if organ, tissue or muscle were taken from, just so much would the general metabolism be interfered with as that organ carried its share of work. Believing that innate is perfect, then if man removes any organ he is just that much denying the ability of Him to do things as they ought to be done. Just so much does he lack of being a true Christian. If a man be a true Christian he must believe in the all wisdom of the Creator, nor must he criticize to the extent of destroying any of His works.116 Passages like this show how D. D. Palmer used traditional Christian religious ideas for rhetorical purposes. Such texts have contributed to the view that D. D. Palmer's use of religion was entirely functional, but a better assessment might regard him as a \"seeker\" who gave full range to his spiritual inquiries through writing. Through 1904 the Palmers and Langworthy had quite similar theories, but these diverged in Modernized Chiropractic and The Science of Chiropractic. The proximity may have been too close for comfort. Proprietary healers often used distinctive terminology and interpretations of shared or overlapping ideas to set themselves apart from their competition. At the same time, the progression of their thought should not be reduced to a marketing technique. All evidence suggests that both the Palmers and the American School chiropractors were genuinely involved in projects of inquiry. Each set of o n t h e f r o n t i e r o f t h e n e w p r o f e s s i o n 143 chiropractic \"investigators\" was learning and changing. They were motivated, I think, by the belief that they were on the cutting edge of a world-changing discovery. Participating in a new science, especially one that promised to be life-giving, must have been a very attractive concept. p o p u l a r i n t e l l e c t u a l i s m a n d s e l f - r e a l i z at i o n The development of chiropractic theory was an intensely creative act with psychic benefits to the actors. The early chiropractors reflected the ethos of the Progressive Era, when an impressive number of people proclaimed an extraordinary discovery from which they seemed to derive an almost existential confirmation. The Progressive Era is commonly understood as a period of conflict between religion and science. Antagonism did erupt in many areas of American culture, but this prompted a large number of people to develop\u2014and disseminate\u2014individual theories of reality that promised to bridge the gap between science and religion. Amid the thicket of cultural ambivalence on questions of science and religion, the impulse to reimagine the world occurred across the spectrum of religious belief. Most often, it was expressed through Metaphysical spirituality or sectarian medicine. The Palmers read and quoted kindred spirits from nineteenth-century dissenting culture. Freethinkers, spiritualists, anarchists, and positive-thinking entrepreneurs only start the list\u2014there isn't room here to describe them all. However, in studying the figures who caught the Palmers' attention, I have found that they seemed to share a mentality that transcended the sharp differences in their ideas: nineteenth-century populist intellectuals were consistently optimistic, antiauthoritarian, and combinative in their treatment of knowledge and truth claims. The image of the Progressive Era that comes to mind is an intellectual frontier, where there was room to challenge established knowledge in a way that contrasts with the current historical moment. Coinciding with what the historian Frederick Jackson Turner in 1893 described as the \"closing\" of the American frontier was an expansion of what Americans understood as possible in their inner lives. In the Progressive Era, a remarkable number of individuals proposed radical revisions to virtually every aspect of human existence: politics and economics, human relationships, physical health, and cosmology. Autodidacts of humble origins, such as D. D. Palmer, had a radically democratic epistemology. This is a central component of what Ernst Troeltsch understood as Spiritual Religion. He used that term, and its counterpart 144 o n t h e f r o n t i e r o f t h e n e w p r o f e s s i o n \"Intellectual Mysticism,\" to describe a religious perspective that engaged spiritual and philosophical questions while giving preeminent authority to the individual. As a church historian, Troeltsch wanted to capture the outlooks and religious styles associated with different periods of Christianity. Troeltsch saw the Reformation as the historical moment when Spiritual Religion became a significant force.117 In the early modern period, print culture created a self-educated cohort, extending what had previously been elite intellectual projects\u2014such as philosophy, politics, science, and religious inquiry\u2014to a greater number of participants. The act of reading changed not only the content of people's knowledge, but affected how they approached the experience of learning. Their discourse led to the individual speculation that broke the control of religious institutions over the laity. The trend accelerated in the nineteenth century, when universalism eclipsed the particulars of normative Christian doctrines. Troeltsch observed that Spiritual Religion was not defined by any specific theological beliefs, but was characterized by \"an individualism which freely combines Christian ideas with all kinds of other elements.\"118 The freedom enjoyed by the individual led to \"indifference\" to religious institutions. In comparison to the routinized authority of the church, or the fellowship of the sect, Troeltsch noted that the social bonds of Spiritual Religion were strikingly weak. It could inspire the formation of social groups, but these existed for the sake of discourse, with participants remaining isolated in their particular beliefs and practices. He suggested that Spiritual Religion sometimes was a practice engaged in solely on paper.119 Writing in the early 1900s, Troeltsch predicted that in the future religious life in industrialized countries like the United States would be increasingly characterized by this individualism, expressed as entrepreneurial spiritual projects, print culture, and voluntary associations. Troeltsch was a committed Lutheran, who decried the secularization that attended Intellectual Mysticism. He saw his own world as determined by the forces of \"modern bourgeois capitalist society\" and \"bureaucratic militaristic states,\" both of which stripped the church of its ability to influence politics and culture. While his predictions proved accurate, Troeltsch felt the rise of Spiritual Religion was actually a dramatic social decline. Autodidacts like D. D. Palmer appear to have felt differently. In The Science of Chiropractic, he championed individual freedom of thought with the admonition, \"If you would be a man, not a flunkey, do not put on the degrading livery of mental slavery which organizations keep for their members. The man o n t h e f r o n t i e r o f t h e n e w p r o f e s s i o n 145 who is true, who has merit, must have his own opinions, must speak his own mind, and live his own life. People know this, and judge accordingly.\" One can detect hints of the transgressive in D. D.'s proclamation. The eclecticism of Spiritual Religion meant that many of its expressions crossed boundaries: those between commerce and religion; cultures and religious traditions; and science and other fields of knowledge. D. D. himself recognized this, and acted accordingly. Many of the social changes of the Progressive Era can be encompassed by the phenomenon of \"mass society,\" a result of industrialization and the emergence of the bureaucratic state. In The Positive Thinkers, historian Donald Meyer interprets the rise of the Metaphysical movement as both a rebellion against the subjective anonymity of the modern age, and a means of accommodating to it.120 Like his fellow Americans who found in Metaphysics a way to reassert their individuality, D. D. found his purpose in the development of chiropractic theory. While many Americans resolved their feelings of alienation through practices of Spiritual Religion, few addressed social realities like the one D. D. faced: finding himself removed from the profession he had created. 146 o n t h e f r o n t i e r o f t h e n e w p r o f e s s i o n chapter five c h i r o p r a c t o r s o n pa r a d e A mind possesses KNOWLEDGE when it refuses to accept as facts and truth the opinions of another until it has weighed all ideas, for and against, and then decides a plan of action justified by his conscience and progressive interests to humanity. \u2014B. J. Palmer, Education\u2014Knowledge\u2014Wisdom, 17. The early twentieth century was a time of rapid growth and development for chiropractic. The basic logic of vitalism meant healing systems could be defined in both religious and scientific terms. Curiously, in the case of early chiropractic, these different presentations unfolded simultaneously. Chiropractors set up practices in scores of locations. The signs outside their offices and advertisements in newspapers made the profession a visible part of the American social landscape. As chiropractic spread like a hardy new plant, in towns across the United States physicians responded as if the practice were an invasive species. Much of the general public was skeptical as well, but some were curious and even receptive. By 1906, the year D. D. left Iowa, the chiropractic world was a vivid tableau, intricate in detail. The Palmers retained their places in the forefront, though their images were balanced by others, some nearly as large in stature. One can envision D. D. and B. J. as figures far apart on the canvas and positioned confrontationally toward each other. Fond of railroads and by temperament a rover, in the last years of his life D. D. traveled widely across the West and Midwest. Amid these excursions, he changed his primary residence several times. Between 1906 and 1908, D. D. and Molly lived in Oklahoma, first in Medford and then Oklahoma City. They moved to Portland, Oregon in November 1908 and stayed there through 1910. In 1911 they went to Los Angeles, where D. D. taught at the newly formed Ratledge School of Chiropractic. While D. D. continued to travel, he was based in California until his death in 1913. 147 D. D. Palmer's unfixed geography presents a striking analogy to the ambiguity of his place in American society and the chiropractic profession. His relocations and travels allowed him to cultivate support throughout the country. D. D. still commanded a following within chiropractic with whom he stayed connected through personal correspondence. He continued to publish advertorials, in which letters of support often were reprinted. These papers tell us he often visited other chiropractic colleges as a guest lecturer. From one perspective, D. D.'s travels moved him to the margins of the chiropractic profession. As chiropractors grew in number they established several strong new colleges, fought pivotal legal battles, and launched organizations for the purpose of collective action. D. D. was an observer rather than a key participant in many of these developments. In both Oklahoma and Oregon, his attempts to open new chiropractic colleges were short-lived: in 1907, while living in Medford and running a grocery store, D. D. was offered a position by Willard Carver to teach at Carver-Denny Chiropractic College. Instead, he decided to partner with Alva Gregory in opening the Palmer-Gregory Chiropractic College in Oklahoma City, but this enterprise lasted no more than 13 weeks. By spring of 1908, D. D. was managing another proprietary institute, the Fountain Head School. After its failure, he may have asked Willard Carver for a job, but never worked at Carver's school. D. D. did somewhat better in his Oregon endeavors. In Portland he first taught at the Gorby-Hinkley School; then, with a few private backers and a more public business partner, he opened the D. D. Palmer College in November 1908. This enterprise lasted more than a year, but in 1910 relations with his business associates appear to have deteriorated. D. D.'s move away from Oregon in 1910 left the college bearing his name in disarray. Its reorganization by John E. LaValley as the Oregon Peerless College of Chiropractic & Neuropathy was the first of several mergers and acquisitions, but against strong odds, the Portland school remained in operation throughout the twentieth century, and today is known as University of Western States. D. D.'s failed proprietary ventures occurred simultaneously with the founding of other chiropractic colleges that rose to national prominence. For aspiring leaders in the profession, a successful venture brought income, prestige, and a cadre of graduates prepared to support one's positions. Not having a stable institution beneath his feet thus cost D. D. some social capital. In contrast, with his father gone, B. J. showed an intense creativity and new confidence as owner of the school in Davenport. He changed its official name: in 1907 the Palmer School of Magnetic Cure was reincorporated as the Palmer School and Infirmary of Chiropractic. From then on it often used the acronym, P.S.I.C., later shortened to PSC 148 c h i r o p r a c t o r s o n p a r a d e Palmer School of Chiropractic, Davenport, Iowa, ca. 1912. Archives, David D. Palmer Health Sciences Library/Palmer College of Chiropractic. In contrast to D. D.'s role as \"discoverer,\" B. J. thought of himself as the \"developer\" of chiropractic science, art, and philosophy. The younger Palmer had great plans for the practice, which he believed would make mainstream medicine obsolete. He invested both money and energy into the proprietary institute, the survival of which owed much to his decision-making. B. J. faced challenges from medical doctors, politicians, and other chiropractors, and over his life he gained a reputation as a merciless opponent, driven by naked self-interest. The same opportunism, however, allowed B. J. to be flexible when advantageous. Early on, B. J. was suspicious of chiropractic licensure by state governments. While it might have carried certain legal protections, it also invited regulation and would bring a loss of control. His opinions changed in 1907, when an alarm was sounded for the Palmer chiropractic empire. It came in the form of a pivotal court case in LaCrosse, Wisconsin.1 \"g o to ja i l f o r c h i r o p r ac t i c \" As an immigrant from Japan, Shegataro Morikubo was received as a novelty when he enrolled at the Palmer School in the spring of 1906.2 B. J. referred to him as \"The Jap,\" and featured many such captioned photos of Morikubo receiving adjustments in The Science of Chiropractic. Morikubo found even c h i r o p r a c t o r s o n p a r a d e 149 greater prejudice in Wisconsin, where he went to practice after graduation. He was arrested in the late summer of 1907, soon after he moved to LaCrosse. Morikubo was charged with illegally practicing both medicine and osteopathy. In fact, local osteopaths, not physicians, may have instigated the investigation, Or it may have been instigated by chiropractors who wished to test the law. The defendant's Asian identity made the trial sensational news. Seeing that nativist sentiments fueled the prosecution and anticipating the attention the case would receive, B. J. Palmer hired an ambitious Wisconsin lawyer named Tom Morris to defend Morikubo. Morris's skillful work changed the prospects of chiropractic in Wisconsin and many surrounding states. Morris pursued a two-stage strategy. First, he succeeded in getting the charge of illegally practicing medicine dropped, on the grounds that Morikubo had not used any drugs. At the time, prescribing medications was the basis for conventional and legal understandings of medical practice. The task at hand thus became proving Morikubo innocent of practicing osteopathy. The second part of Morris's strategy was to argue that chiropractic was distinct from osteopathy because chiropractic acted on the nervous system, while the latter was primarily concerned with the blood. Morris built his argument using the American School's Modernized Chiropractic rather than the writings or testimony of either Palmer. Morris was pragmatic; well-structured and professionally presented, Modernized Chiropractic provided stronger evidence that cutting-edge theories of anatomy and physiology stood behind the methods of chiropractic. The defense was a landmark for chiropractic theory; its successful use in the definition of chiropractic against osteopathy made nerve theory central and normative to the profession. Though probably not evident at the time, the trial was a key moment in the formation of chiropractic identity. Morikubo's acquittal gave chiropractic legal standing as a system distinct from both osteopathy and medicine. This victory encouraged chiropractors to aggressively fight charges of illicit medicine. The Morikubo case also was a personal triumph for the defense counsel; Tom Morris rode the crest of public opinion to be elected lieutenant governor of Wisconsin. Morikubo moved to Minnesota and practiced for two decades, dying in 1933.3 Yet the Morikubo win was conflictual for B. J. Palmer because it conferred legitimacy upon his rivals. It appears to have invigorated his efforts to dominate the chiropractic profession. Among other things, he increased his support of an organization he had chartered in 1905 called the Universal Chiropractors' Association.4 With B. J. as president, the UCA became the exponent of a controversial legal strategy: a policy requiring all members accused 150 c h i r o p r a c t o r s o n p a r a d e of practicing medicine illegally to demand jury trials. The UCA won support from its members by promising to send legal representation and other assistance, but chiropractors who were convicted were expected to refuse to pay fines and serve sentences in prison instead.5 The \"Go to Jail for Chiropractic\" campaign struck many chords with the American public. Not only did it draw on the spirit of populist dissent then circulating in both American politics and culture, it rallied support for the cause of chiropractic with all the entertainment of a nineteenth-century traveling show. Although D. D.'s behavior in the 1905 Lucretia Lewis case embarrassed the entire Palmer family, it may have taught B. J. the value of trying a case in the court of public opinion. During the period in question, most conflicts between health factions still were distinctly local. As physicians organized politically, their efforts to root out small-town \"quackery\" offered in-group cohesion. Local medical societies often encouraged district attorneys to investigate and prosecute unlicensed practitioners. In such an environment, both partisan politics and individual personalities were critical factors in the launching of cases against alternative healers and in their outcomes in court. Furthermore, this environment made winning civic debates a major task for both regulars and irregulars. With \"Go to Jail for Chiropractic,\" chiropractors declared they were willing to fight out the local skirmishes of a much longer campaign. Through \"Go to Jail for Chiropractic,\" chiropractors presented a case based on \"conscience\" and independence of thought. The campaign succeeded in portraying chiropractors as dedicated healthcare providers who were unfairly persecuted for doing an effective but misunderstood healing practice. Photos of chiropractors behind bars ran in local newspapers across the country and affected the sentiments of the American public, who came to view chiropractors as performers of civil disobedience, unfairly punished for their contributions to the public good. Debate about the profession shifted to a platform of civil liberties. \"s h e e p 's c lot h i n g w i l l n ot c h a n g e t h e n at u r e o f t h e w o l f \" Despite rapid organization, the chiropractic profession did not have deep foundations. Chiropractic was vulnerable economically, socially, and scientifically, and its long-term survival depended on establishing legitimacy in the public eye, which would secure legal protections and generate clientele. B. J. spread the chiropractic message through free clinics and public lectures, c h i r o p r a c t o r s o n p a r a d e 151 and a blizzard of newsprint. The Chiropractor became the advocacy paper of the UCA and later the Chiropractic Health Bureau, another organization B. J. had backed. A patient \"infirmary\" had been part of the Palmers' Davenport operation from the beginning; B. J.'s expansion of the PSC clinic established the school as a site offering chiropractic care. The patients, some of whom came from great distances, gave Palmer students \"hands-on\" practice in developing chiropractic skills. No less important, aggregation of their case histories allowed Palmer faculty to begin conducting research studies, which could offer scientific justifications for the system. B. J. also sought to redefine the terms on which battles with mainstream science and medicine might be fought. Late in 1907, he began to write vigorously on \"Chiropractic Philosophy,\" in which he saw an entirely new \"philosophy of biology.\" B. J. now defined chiropractic as a \"philosophy of biology, theology, health, disease, death, the cause of disease and the art of adjusting the relations between them to harmonious quantities, by hand, thus correcting all subluxations of the three hundred articulations of the human skeletal frame, more especially of the spinal column, for the purpose of reestablishing the normal current through the impinged nerves, as they emanate through intervertebral foramina, restoring normal function, which were f ormally excessive or lacking, named disease.\"6 Passages like this one are typical of B. J.'s writing: boosterish, with grand promises and mystifying technical jargon. Given B. J.'s penchant for self-promotion, one might be led to agree etaphysics as with Cyrus Lerner, who dismissed B. J.'s engagement with M an attempt to take back chiropractic theory from Langworthy and his companions.7 While the timing of B. J.'s announcement suggests it was partly a reaction to the American School, his lifelong interest in spirituality undercuts such a facile explanation. B. J., now in his late twenties, was coming into his own. In the process, he was embracing and expanding all aspects of his father's life work, including a receptivity to religious inquiry. How D. D. felt about his son's activities is a different matter, and it is essential to understanding the elder Palmer's activities at this time. D. D. saw himself as \"dispossessed.\" Yet he seems to have had no trouble making a living, even if he never achieved significant wealth. His fee scale in Portland bespeaks a canny pragmatism and skill for self-promotion that appeared to pay off: \"Prices vary all the way from nothing and up. The founder of Chiropractic has $15 per week in his office and $25 per week at residence in the city. He is not cutting under the boys' prices. 'The Chiropractor' should do good work and expect the best pay. The man who underrates his services and charges accordingly is signing his own social and professional death-warrant.\"8 D. D. and 152 c h i r o p r a c t o r s o n p a r a d e Molly lived comfortably on the West Coast. His fifth marriage was noticeably happy, which comes perhaps as a pleasant irony. Some of the Palmer family's writings claim that D. D. and Molly knew each other as youths. The \"childhood sweethearts\" rejoiced in being reunited, after each had been widowed. D. D. used the phrase \"The Palmer Kids\" to describe himself and Molly. They took several steamship vacations into Oregon and Washington. D. D.'s reports on these \"outings\" communicate a pleasure in their relationship that contrasts with depictions of his marriages in nearly all of his earlier writing. While not settled in space, D. D. appears to have found his place in time. In his seventh decade he was comfortable being an elderly man, albeit a capable, spirited one. One of D. D.'s greatest strengths was his ability to adjust to change. At this point, his own aspirations seem to have been modest, though there is ample evidence that he did command some allegiance in the profession. Throughout his later years, D. D. tried to work independently, but also sought alliances and support from those whom he regarded as his chiropractic progeny. He enjoyed warm friendships with some of his former students, while toward others he expressed rage and disappointment. His greatest weaknesses were volatility and difficulty staying with a relationship or work endeavor. Between 1908 and 1910, D. D. Palmer published a bi-monthly serial, The Chiropractor Adjustor. While only a handful of issues came out, the publication is a window onto D. D.'s enduring character and changing fortunes, and the best record of the last years of his life. The Chiropractor Adjustor was folksy and informal. Poems were the first item in most issues. Many of these were written by \"Elizabeth Helfrich,\" a chiropractic enthusiast. The booklets carried columns of \"corny\" riddles, which often had medical doctors as their target. One array of jokes read: What is the greatest surgical operation on record? Lansing, Mich. Why are ladies thought to be wicked? Because they bone their stays, steel their petticoats, crib their babies and hook each others dresses. Why is a blush an exhibition of nerve? Because the woman who blushes is admired for her cheek. Why should not professionals take castor oil? Because it is only intended for working people. Which travels faster, heat or cold? Heat, of course, because any one can catch a cold. Why is a pig fast under a gate like a man taking a(n) [chiropractic] adjustment? Because they both have impingements and want the pressure removed. c h i r o p r a c t o r s o n p a r a d e 153 When are people like pianos? When they are square, upright and in tune. Why is a back-biter like a(n) [chiropractic] adjustor? Because they both give it in the back. Why are relapses like adjustments? Because they have their backsets. Why is a cook's apron like a dose of medicine? Because it goes against her stomach.9 But like all of D. D.'s previous publications, The Chiropractor Adjustor also delivered swipes at professional rivals. Clearly, the peace he obtained in his domestic life with Molly did not alleviate the bitterness D. D. felt about his alienation from the profession. D. D. decried the ignorance of other chiropractors and their failure to accord him the respect he deserved. He regarded his role in the chiropractic world as \"The Adjuster\"\u2014one charged and entitled to determine true chiropractic theory, and promised that the magazine would live up to its title, and \"adjust all abnormalities found in Chiropractic literature, that right is inherent.\"10 In the pages of the serial that attested to this name (the former with an atypical spelling to distinguish the publication from the man), he criticized prominent rivals, while also printing accolades from them. If D. D.'s engagement with specific chiropractors was ambiguous, his rage against \"thieves\" and \"imitators\" was not. D. D. reminded prospective matriculates that, \"Students under D. D. Palmer receive instruction first handed, direct from the Fountain Head; not one of them can ever step in his boots, or wear his hat. Sheep's clothing will not change the nature of the wolf, neither will second hand goods become first handed because of their being placed in a fountain. Water will not wash out the deception, fraud and chicanery. Such trickery will not satisfy the public or the avariciousness of one who is 'waiting just like a hungry wolf for a dinner.\"11 The conflict between D. D. and B. J. cut through the chiropractic world. D. D. printed a letter to D. D.'s partner, L. M. Gordon, from his father, A. N. Gordon of Elkhart, Indiana. A. N. Gordon advised his son that he and D. D. be restrained in their dealings with B. J.: \"I don't believe you and D. D. will make anything by attacking B. J. in your journal. Go right along; tend strictly to business and pay not attention to what he says. B. J. cannot hurt your business, but he can hurt ordon may have B. J. by trying to down his father.\"12 Chiropractors like L. M. G felt it important that the Palmers transcend their acrimony for the good of the profession, but both D. D. and B. J. saw compromise as retreat. 154 c h i r o p r a c t o r s o n p a r a d e I have often imagined the Palmers as figures caught in a nineteenth-century parlor drama. In such a \"tableau,\" I envision a fountain between them, a symbol of their competition. Images and metaphors of fountains appear often in nineteenth-century popular intellectual culture, where they represented sources of wisdom and authoritative knowledge. For the Palmers, the term \"Fountain Head\" meant acknowledged authorship of chiropractic theory\u2014 and thereby leadership in the profession. D. D. had begun comparing his discovery of chiropractic to a fountain early on. His self-identification as the \"Chiropractic Fountain Head\" made him feel justified in taking the term and the social power it implied with him on leaving Davenport. For the short duration of its life, D. D.'s Oklahoma City college was known as the \"Fountain Head School.\"13 About the same time, however, B. J. began using the phrase \"Chiropractic Fountain-Head\" to describe the college in Davenport, and by extension his own leadership. B. J. sought to maintain the public connection to his father's legacy, and used D. D.'s image on promotional materials, but the text of B. J.'s publications identified the \"Fountain\" with the school. In 1912, B. J. began a second periodical, the Fountain Head News. The graphics of the masthead communicated B. J.'s growing ambitions; the title was presented like a theater marquee. In the center of the text was a fountain, comprised of the head of a lion-like beast, from whose mouth gushed a stream running into an urn beneath. What is more, B. J. had done away with the Gregorian calendar. Setting the Lillard Incident in 1895, he marked that year as the beginning of the \"A.C.\"\u2014\"After Chiropractic\" era. The question of whether \"Fountain Head\" referred to D. D. or the institution generated hot debates in both Palmers' publications. D. D. believed B. J. had taken and corrupted his life's work\u2014which, by some measures, was true. Starting in 1904 with The Chiropractor and continuing with The Science of Chiropractic in 1906, B. J. obtained copyright for much of D. D.'s writing. At the time, this was probably done to prevent other spinal therapists from stealing the Palmers' ideas, but after their partnership disintegrated, D. D. found himself in the nearly untenable position of being unable to reprint his own materials. The only way he could do so was to quote himself (with full citations) from articles published in The Chiropractor. This would be a maddening situation for any author, and it almost certainly spurred on D. D.'s decision to write new material. While there is much evidence that D. D. Palmer was sincere in his beliefs, revising his theories held certain personal advantages. Most obviously, developing what became known as his \"Third Theory of Chiropractic\" let c h i r o p r a c t o r s o n p a r a d e 155 D. D. circumvent limitations put in place by B. J. D. D.'s ongoing research and writing also gave him the means to engage discursively with the chiropractic profession. In The Chiropractor Adjustor, D. D. printed letters of support from allies, and more than once he took a rival to the literary woodshed. Far greater than these \"social goods,\" though, were the intellectual benefits afforded by D. D.'s chiropractic studies. Chiropractic let him invest his creativity and imagination, perhaps limiting the effect of these traits in other areas of his life. D. D. wrote, \"No other profession offers such a golden opportunity to think, reason, investigate and discover new and valuable truths as Chiropractic.\"14 His continued search for discovery may not have created a \"fixed\" worldview, but set its trajectory. Above all, it seems to have been \"psychically organizing\"\u2014a venture in which he found existential confirmation. the third chiropractic theory D. D. sincerely wanted to attune chiropractic to the best of what he knew about human biology. In the years after he left Davenport, he tried to reach a new d\u00e9tente with the ideas, if not the people, of regular medicine. While his dreams did not come to fruition, he announced that the curriculum at D. D. Palmer College in Portland would include courses in obstetrics, surgery, and dissection. And despite his hostility toward physicians, D. D. began reprinting passages from medical texts in his own publications. It is very likely, though, that these were contributions from one of his associates, a homeopath named G. H. Patchen. Years later, when B. J. reprinted D. D.'s \"textbook,\" which like the Portland advertorials was entitled The Chiropractor's Adjuster, he included a thirty-page letter by Patchen, attesting to his role in compiling of the medical materials. While D. D. may not have been the author of the medical content, he clearly approved of it enough to claim it as his own assemblage.15 The modification in D. D.'s stance toward medical knowledge came alongside many other changes in his ideas: he made a full break with the fluidic model of the nervous system. In what became the \"Third Chiropractic Theory,\" nerve impulses were held to be transmitted by \"tone\" and \"vibration.\"16 D. D.'s interest in vibration theory went back decades, as one sees from the sources in his Portable Library and his mention of Oliver Sabin in The Chiropractor in 1904. But his latest theory was more conceptually and anatomically sophisticated than anything he had posited before. In 1910 D. D. Palmer introduced the idea that normal nerves vibrated at a frequency of 200 times per minute.17 By the end of the year, he unfurled a vitalist theory that 156 c h i r o p r a c t o r s o n p a r a d e envisioned the nerves as tiny strings or wires, whose vibrations transmitted nervous impulse, asserting that \"nerves have no channels; their carrying capacity depends upon their ability to vibrate.\"18 The Third Theory built on D. D.'s earlier belief that the nervous system regulated temperature. D. D. now claimed that the excessive \"molecular vibration\" of irritated nerves created internal heat. Such a change was seen as causing fevers and inflammation, now identified as the primary manifestations of disease.19 The Third Theory also reworked the \"vital principle\" concept. D. D. took pains to point out that vital energy did not make a circuitous path in the body. Rather, vital energy was \"expressed\" at the end point of a nervous impulse. \"Energy is not a fluid, it does not flow as a current thru the nerves. It is physiologically, the potential, latent power; the action, vigor or force expended in the performance of functions. Vital force is not cyclic, it does not move in circles. Vital energy is expended in the performance of functions at the terminal endings of nerves; it does not return in a circle or otherwise. Vital force or energy can not be transmitted in a circle.\"20 D. D. seems to have regarded this distinction as an important change. It tied in with his revised understanding of the effects of subluxations. D. D. now held that subluxations affected the \"momentum\" of nervous impulses. \"A subluxation does not restrain or liberate vital energy. Vital energy is expressed in functional activity. A subluxation may impinge against nerves the transmitting channel may increase or decrease the momentum of impulses, not energy. Vital energy is not transmitted thru the nervous system or any other; it is expressed in functional acts. Nerve tension determines the velocity of the impulses transmitted. Vital energy is expressed at the peripheral nerve endings. The momentum, the quantity of motion received thru vibration (the amount of vibration is determined by tension), determines the amount of energy. A subluxation does not restrain. Vital energy is not transmitted over, thru or by the nervous system.\"21 With this focus on vibration, D. D. Palmer now regarded the nerves as strings like those of an instrument. This metaphor informed his concept of \"Tone,\" upon which he now claimed to base the science of chiropractic. \"Tonicity\" pertained to the transmission of nerve impulses.22 The following passage contains many ideas central to the new theory: Tone is a term used to denote a normal degree of vigor, tension, activity, strength and excitability of nerves and muscles, as observed in a state of health\u2014the effect of tonicity. Tonicity determines the tone. Excessive tonicity causes an augmentation of vital phenomena; c h i r o p r a c t o r s o n p a r a d e 157 a deficiency of tonicity a want of tone, a loss or diminution of muscular or vital strength. The quality of irritability gives tone. Tone or tonicity is that normal tension which belongs to the involuntary nerves and muscles, the insensible irritation and contractility of the nervous and muscular systems manifested in the vital operations of circulation, transudation, secretion, nutrition and absorption. Inordinate excitement of the moral and malevolent emotions unduly irritates the nervous system, both the voluntary and involuntary. By nerve and muscle tone, I mean a continuous shortening or contraction, which under normal conditions is slight, varying from time to time. This condition is dependent upon the connection of the muscles with the nerve centers, which are continually sending nerve impulses into the muscles, the result is, the muscles have a continuous contraction known as tone. This normal tension plays an important part in controlling and furnishing the heat of the body. By a disturbance of this tone\u2014normal tension\u2014we have a condition known as inflammation. The intensity of tone depends upon the amount of vibrations of the transmitting medium\u2014nerves. It is well known that a gradually weaker and weaker sounding string exhibits a corresponding smaller amount of vibration.23 D. D. posited that nerves responded to irritating stimuli by contracting. \"Tone\" thus referred to the level and quality of the tension of nerves. The measure of such nervous contraction was called \"tonicity.\" Tonicity affected the vibration of nerves; vibratory disturbances disrupted the ability of the nerves to transmit impulses, which led to secondary causes of disease like inflammation and fever, and affected many internal processes, like digestion: \"Tone is the elasticity and renitency of tissue which responds to compression. The elastic force of nerves furnishes the momentum of impulses. This innate quality of springing back, recovering its normal size, shape and position is known as tone. Hence, we have nerve tone, muscle tone, arterial tone, etc., meaning the ability of those tissues to assume, return to their normal position, size and shape after being acted upon by pressure. It is a self-evident fact that any change in tissue other than that of normal tension, produces disease, tone being the product of elasticity and renitency.\"24 When and how the shift in D. D.'s thinking unfolded is important. D. D.'s ideas about nerve vibration made their debut in the September 1909 Chiropractor Adjustor. That issue also carried an article entitled, \"Joy M. Loben.\" D. D. had misspelled the name of Joy Loban, a Palmer graduate teaching at 158 c h i r o p r a c t o r s o n p a r a d e the Portland school. An essay by Loban, entitled \"The Completeness of Chiropractic Philosophy,\" had run in the August 1908 issue of The Chiropractor, still being published in Davenport by B. J.25 Loban's piece and D. D.'s response raise another round of questions about the authorship of early chiropractic ideas. These articles, and the discourse in which they were embedded, are critical to interpreting D. D.'s \"Third Chiropractic Theory.\" Among other things, they show the younger chiropractor was publishing about vibration almost a year before D. D. did so. Loban introduced what appeared to be a new claim about chiropractic: that the nerves transmitted impulses by \"vibration.\" Nervous vibration, however, was only part of a larger theory presented in \"The Completeness of Chiropractic Philosophy.\" Most of the essay addressed the Metaphysical paradigm of Innate, Educated, and Universal Intelligences. For Loban, Chiropractic Philosophy was meant to connect every layer of being\u2014from the atom to the universe. Loban even explained how chiropractic could be effective at the microcosmic level: \"Every cell has its nerve fibrillae, which end in the cell of the protoplasmic fluid which fills the cell and which carry impulses, which in their expression each induce a separate character of protoplasmic action.\"26 Loban's philosophy resonated with Metaphysical ideas, and for that reason he is included as one of the Metaphysicians in Catherine L. Albanese's book, Nature Religion in America.27 Yet as Albanese points out, Loban's essay was distinctive for its scientific orientation. He was especially forward-thinking in his knowledge of physics: \"Now we know that with every atom of matter there is a force-unit co-existing; and since matter is theoretically infinitely divisible, there must exist correspondingly infinite divisibility of force. Energy in itself is immaterial, and therefore, capable of occupying the same space at the same time as the material.\"28 Loban defined Chiropractic Philosophy as the \"Philosophy of Cause,\" and made the bold claim that Chiropractic Philosophy revealed ultimate truths about the universe: the knowledge it revealed went \"back\u2014far out beyond the limits of either Theology or Materialism\u2014to the first and Absolute Cause.\" Loban expounded: The Universal Intelligence which stands as the primal Creator of all other things existent, and which is, in itself, self-existent; from which emanate or issue, Matter, Energy, Time and Space, is the first consideration. MATTER, ENERGY, TIME, and SPACE are co-ordinate and co-existent and eternal. Intelligence occupies and pervades all space, all time, all energy and all matter; without Intelligence there could be c h i r o p r a c t o r s o n p a r a d e 159 no time, no space, no matter, no energy. The primal condition, then, is Intelligence; matter, energy, time and space being the four secondary conditions included in the first. The Universal Intelligence has seen fit to gather together matter in definite forms, to make it amenable to certain laws of energy, and to assign to it a definite position in space; this accumulation we call the Universe because to us it is all that exists; anything further would be beyond our comprehension. The Creator has seen fit further to place upon that aggregation of matter called the Earth, organic life, or the expression of Individualized Intelligence through matter arranged in definite, composite form. In my further elucidation of principles, let it be understood that I invariably allude to them as being the fulfillment of the purposes of the Ruling Intelligence.29 Loban's understanding of Chiropractic Philosophy was, in certain ways, very distinct from other Metaphysical systems. Loban conceived of the material world as an expression of divine Mind. This conception resonated with the idealism that runs strongly through Harmonial philosophy. At the same time, Loban's Chiropractic Philosophy revised the \"mind over matter' claim popular in Christian Science and New Thought, and advanced a more reciprocal understanding of these categories. \"Just as matter is dependent upon the Mind for its existence in organized form, so is the Mind dependent upon Matter for its development.\" Instead of viewing the world as a base projection of the Mind, Mind was seen to be most fully expressed through the material world\u2014\"mind through matter.\" By presenting ideas associated with D. D.'s later chiropractic positions before D. D. himself published on them, Loban's essay makes it ever more difficult to trace the origins of chiropractic theory: its \"discoverers\" and \"developers,\" and their influences. I am inclined to believe that at least some of the statements about vibration that D. D. published in the September 1909 issue were written before D. D. read Loban's work. It is more likely that Loban's theory reflected a synthesis of ideas circulating at Palmer, burnished by his own erudite interpretation. He may even may have read some of D. D.'s writings, apparently still housed at Palmer. Throughout his life, B. J. claimed to have rescued chiropractic from his father, and he often added the detail of retrieving D. D.'s discarded writing from the trash can. Notwithstanding the theatrics of the tale, it indicates that B. J. and his associates had access to large quantities of D. D.'s published and unpublished work. By 1910 at the latest, as B. J.'s lecture notes attest, vibration theory was taught as part of the Palmer curriculum.30 160 c h i r o p r a c t o r s o n p a r a d e D. D. faced the persistent problem of being \"scooped.\" While at Davenport and then out West, he most likely proposed vibration theory in a rough form, and then ignored it like a toy whose value he only saw later on. It is hard to trust the chronology and authorial pedigree of any specific text, but some passages were probably quickly written responses to Loban's theory. D. D.'s thoughts on vibration seem to still have been in the planning stages in 1908. One illustrative statement was a set of four propositions, formatted much in the way of his musings from the 1880s: Age makes a difference in the texture of nerve tissue. The texture of nerves differ in individuals, which accounts for the difference in their makeup. The number of nerve vibrations depends upon their solidity. The amount of vibrations determines the degree of heat.31 D. D.'s rebuttal in The Chiropractor Adjustor corrected Loban on several technical points, as he did other chiropractors: \"Dr. Loben has attempted to make use of the molecular vibration theory lately put forth by the Founder of the Science. He has not fully grasped the transference of impulses by molecular vibration.\"32 He also took Loban to task for misrepresenting the origins of the term \"chiropractic,\" insisting here that Rev. Weed had only translated D. D.'s concept into Greek, rather than conferring a name to the profession. Yet D. D. was forced to acknowledge Loban's promise, with prose that c onveys a sense of knighting: \"I am pleased to see that he has embraced molecular vibration as the kinetic energy, as the means used by Innate to transmit its impulses, vital functions, the energy of life. It will take some thinking for Dr. Loben or anyone else to fully comprehend and apply molecular vibration to the transmitting of impulses. If I rightly judge the doctor, he is of the right makeup to do the thinking.\"33 All told, D. D.'s rebuke was less an excoriation than a disciplinary intervention and a reassertion of doctrinal authority. Most importantly, D. D.'s monitoring of Loban's work did not extend to its formulation of Chiropractic Philosophy. D. D. found little to disagree with in the article's general argument. Because Loban presented chiropractic theory as established truths and not something he personally could take credit for, D. D. did not accuse him of stealing the \"chiropractic idea,\" which points to an interesting change unfolding in chiropractic discourse. Chiropractic Philosophy was rationalizing as a system of ideas, and already was handling certain premises as truths to be shared, rather than proprietary information. Loban cited B. J. as the source of his ideas, to the point of making a mock apology for borrowing so much material: \"In conclusion, candor compels me to state that c h i r o p r a c t o r s o n p a r a d e 161 I have quoted freely from the utterances of B. J. Palmer. I find it impossible to elucidate Chiropractic Philosophy without repeating at times the wording of the originator of that philosophy. For this bold plagiarism I offer no apology, but simply plead necessity.\"34 The Palmers' expectations of deference stand in bold, unflattering colors that have not faded with time. Loban may have chafed under the yoke of this demand, but he sent D. D. an apology for having misspoken about the origins of the term \"chiropractic\" and Weed's role.35 Loban does not seem to have acceded to D. D.'s claim as the originator of \"nerve vibration\"; at least, D. D. did not print such a response. D. D. published several paragraphs of Loban's acknowledgment that the elder Palmer had chosen the profession's name. He surely meant to be magnanimous in his acceptance of Loban's apology, but his published statement was both affable and ominous, in other words displaying all the complexities of D. D.'s character: \"Right you are, J. M. No one should question the right of the discoverer and developer to name the science of which he is the founder. The time will come when the world will respect and honor the man who had the ability to discover and develop the greatest science of the age.\"36 D. D. corrected Loban once more in the February 1910 Chiropractor Adjustor. The topic of Loban's article\u2014an evaluation of the quality of some spinal specimens owned by Willard Carver\u2014is hardly significant. The social meaning of D. D.'s tirade is much more important. He chastised Loban for referring to Carver, whom D. D. called Loban's \"senior professionally,\" by the disrespectful nickname, \"Bill.\"37 Dynastic claims were reinforced and power relations were reasserted in D. D.'s dwelling on a fine point of diction and etiquette. It was a petty swipe, but it carried all the intimacies and tensions of the chiropractic world. Not all of D. D.'s relationships were fractious. Out on the West Coast, at some point between 1908 and 1910 he met a writer named William Juvenal Colville. Their friendship may hold the key to the revisions D. D. made to chiropractic theory. W. J. Colville is seldom mentioned in chiropractic historiography. I learned about him tracking D. D.'s biography, but I have come to regard him as a multicarat gem, buried and unnoticed. Like D. D., Colville's early life was not one of privilege.38 He was born in England in 1859 to a French mother and an Italian father who died when he was eight. Poverty made his formal education episodic, as did his poor health. Although not a good student, Colville was recognized as an intellectually precocious authority on Spiritualism while still in his teens. His career began when he was discovered as a medium by 162 c h i r o p r a c t o r s o n p a r a d e Cora Richmond, a popular British spiritualist. Soon the pair was appearing together on the London stage. Colville arrived in the United States in 1878 or 1879. This visit gathered him some minor headlines in Shaker and Oneida newsletters: Colville had predicted, with apocalyptic overtones, that by 1881 or 1882 Anglophone countries would experience world-changing events. The passing of the dates had little impact on Colville's career as a public lecturer, which lasted 35 years. He authored more than twenty books, and was one of the most consistent contributors to The Metaphysical Magazine. Colville was intellectually gifted enough to have been able to lead a spiritual movement in his own right, had he been so inclined. Even so, it is curious that he is not better known. It may be that much of his writing is very derivative\u2014 summaries of ideas developed by prominent Theosophists, New Thought leaders, and health reformers. Colville's explanations were often more cogent than the originals on which they were based. Newspaper accounts depicted Colville as congenial, a \"people-pleaser\" who understood and could deliver exactly what his audiences wanted to hear. His opportunism, however, was quite consistent with the self-promoting, entrepreneurial spirit that popular intellectuals needed to survive. I would venture that this trait was one of the reasons D. D. Palmer saw in him a kindred spirit. Colville made several extended visits to the West. Details of the first meeting between him and D. D. are unknown, but their relationship seems to have been genuinely cordial, based on a shared interest in Metaphysical philosophy, world religions, and spiritualism. D. D.'s writing provides direct evidence of their friendship and their exchange of ideas. Colville wrote extensively on auras and other paranormal phenomena known to be of interest to D. D., whose chiropractic textbook published in 1910 carried a poem, \"Ode to Chiropractic,\" by the English medium. Furthermore, in The Chiropractor's Adjuster D. D. cited Colville's book, The Spiritual Science of Health and Healing, as the source of several new insights about chiropractic, such as its ties to ancient Egyptian medicine.39 Colville may have contributed to D. D. Palmer's theorization of chiropractic \"vibration.\" Like many Theosophists, Colville believed in a \"vibratory\" universe, similar to the one depicted by Helena Blavatsky in The Secret Doctrine. Theosophical vibration theories borrowed from the physical sciences and reinterpreted them through the lens of populist spirituality. Theosophists asserted that atoms and molecules resonated at a standard frequency. This quality connected matter, force, and spirit\u2014thus holding together the fabric of the universe. There were many variants of the theory, but usually the vibratory property was extended, so as to apply also to \"etherial matter,\" c h i r o p r a c t o r s o n p a r a d e 163 the rarefied substance that served as the physical substratum of the spiritual world in many Metaphysical theories. \"Nervous Vibration\" legitimated alternative health practices when their earlier therapeutic logic fell out of step with orthodox medicine. As advances in understanding of the nervous system made tubular theories impossible, hypotheses about the resonating of the nerve fibers became popular. Vibration theory derived from the alternative physics of American Metaphysics. These premises can be found in a curious book called Occult Chemistry, which was not about chemistry at all, but rather was a revision of atomic physics. The authors, Theosophical writers Annie Besant and Charles Leadbeater, asserted that the \"vibratory\" state of the universe connected the material and \"etherial\" worlds. Colville endorsed their research in his book, A History of Theosophy.40 Colville also was a staunch defender of the controversial inventor John Worrell Keely, founder of the Keely Motor Company. In 1872, Keely proclaimed he could access and control \"vibratory force\" through the use of tuning forks and similar devices. From then on, he unveiled ever more elaborate inventions intended to harness etheric power. After Keely died in 1898, Colville delivered his funeral address. Shortly thereafter, Keely's business partners discovered his machine was an elaborate theatrical prop, but Colville remained a loyal promoter.41 Cosmic Vibration is a major theme in Rosicrucianism, and a main explanatory mechanism for Metaphysical healing.42 Harvey Spencer Lewis believed the Essenes had a healing sect, the \"Therapeuti,\" who performed vibrational healing: \"It is the 'vibratory energy' that is referred to in our earliest monographs under various names, and which constitutes the real key to the healing processes in the Rosicrucian system.\"43 D. D. Palmer never formally endorsed Rosicrucianism or Theosophy, though his silence on this point is consistent with his ambivalence toward other systems. Even so, the Theosophical connections merit further study, for by 1909 D. D. linked human anatomy to vibratory physics: Ether fills the space of the universe. Through the vibration of its atoms, the light from the sun, moon, and stars is made visible. Ether pervades all space; it penetrates the intercies [sic] between the smallest particles of ponderable matter. It is the medium of light and heat. Agitation of ether atoms transmits heat through space and bodies. . . . Every molecule consists of atoms. Ponderable atoms do not cohere, they are separated by spaces. Interposed ether prevents immediate contact of atoms. Solid bodies have fixed forms; their molecules are arranged in 164 c h i r o p r a c t o r s o n p a r a d e a permanent figure, an unchangeable relation to each other. Fluid bodies have a variability of shape, its molecules are constantly undergoing change. . . . Heat is the result of atomical action. There are three forms, or degrees of heat: animal, light and fire. These owe their different degrees to the number of vibrations in a given time. Vibrations are of a tremulous character. Deviations of heat have each their variation. Pathological changes are due to the modification of animal heat.44 D. D.'s Third Theory was very much at odds with most chiropractors' ideas, but in concordance with Theosophists' refiguring of the hard sciences. A solid line of connection cannot be drawn, but D. D.'s friendship with Colville may have encouraged his spiritual investigations. This would certainly explain other developments in D. D.'s thought. In the third issue of the 1909 Chiropractor Adjustor, D. D. Palmer made an enigmatic statement about \"communicating\" nerves that linked the spinal nerves to the \"ganglionic cord\" or \"ganglionic chain.\"45 In actuality, influences on D. D.'s ideas about nerve ganglia could date back to Xavier Bichat, one of the earliest sources. But I believe it is most likely that D. D. came to Bichat's theories through works by and about Paschal Beverly Randolph, a founding figure in American Rosicrucianism. Other ambiguities in D. D.'s writing become less confusing when viewed through the lens of esotericism. Among other things, D. D.'s claim, late in his life, that he learned chiropractic from the spirit of a physician named Jim Atkinson becomes instantly meaningful. William Walker Atkinson is best known for being one of the formulators of the Law of Attraction; but he also was an important source for Rosicrucian teachings. While Colville's true ties to the movement cannot be determined, he is known to have been in contact with Rosicrucian writers, and he drew on their ideas in his own writing.46 The blooming Palmer-Colville friendship coincided with D. D.'s more pronounced interest in esotericism, and Colville is likely to have been an important conduit for D. D.'s knowledge of the occult. In that light, mention of the ghost of Jim Atkinson in The Chiropractor's Adjuster is an esoteric Easter egg. Though he does not acknowledge the similarity, D. D.'s conception of nervous tissue in the Third Theory very closely resembles ideas associated with the eighteenth-century physiologist and philosopher David Hartley.47 Hartley believed sensory data were carried as vibrations through a subtle medium of \"ether,\" which extended into the human body through the nervous system. The brain and nerves had units called \"vibratiuncles\" to transmit and process etheric vibration. c h i r o p r a c t o r s o n p a r a d e 165 Was D. D. going backward as well as forward, embracing modern anatomy and reviving ever older theories of bodily function? D. D. did not have to read Hartley to encounter his ideas. Hartley's \"Doctrines of Vibrations\" was widely syndicated by popular physiologists. Reading his work expansively, they saw it establishing a firm link between mind and body. Among other things, vibration is the basis of the Law of Attraction popularized by William Walker Atkinson.48 Though he did not directly credit any prominent New Thought thinker, D. D. Palmer agreed strongly with Atkinson's theories. Using \"reformed spelling,\" he asserted that \"Thots are real, verifiable things; they travel thru space by ethereal vibration.\"49 D. D. Palmer intended the The Chiropractor's Adjuster to be a textbook (and subtitled as such), promising readers, \"In this volume I am endeavoring scientifically to replace belief with facts, nescience with science, error with truth. Heretofore, medical science has been swimming as a superficial film on the sea of infinite unknowableness. The sciences of geology, astronomy, psychology, biology, chemistry and last, but not least, Chiropractic, are shedding their rays of light on the heretofore unknowable.\"50 His magnum opus at almost a thousand pages long, it is a treasure trove of A mericana, with poems, jokes, and a variety of texts reprinted from other sources. D. D. railed against all his old rivals and many new ones, and even his insults communicate a great deal about the chiropractic world. For example, we get a vivid list of the medical devices advertised by an unnamed school, which were marketed as \"Twentieth Century Appliances.\" These included: \"the Solar Therapeutic Lamp and the Electric Light Bath Cabinet . . . the Arc Lamp, Centrifugal Douche, Home Douche, Dynometer, Hand Sinusoidal Apparatus, Thermophore and Vibratory Chair,\" as well as \" the Ampliathrill, the greatest auxiliary for use in Spinal Treatment of the Twentieth Century.\"51 His complaint about another chiropractor reveals this \"Mixer\" to be practicing, \"physiological and Vibro-Therapy.\"52 a m e ta p h y s i c a l t u r n f o r d . d . pa l m e r The turn to vibration was part of a more intense Metaphysical presentation of chiropractic as well as a hearty embrace of the supernatural. D. D. included his musings on paranormal phenomena like \"human auras\" and the physical powers and properties of thought. His conception of the 166 c h i r o p r a c t o r s o n p a r a d e relationship of the individual human being to the cosmos was evolving. The March 1909 Chiropractor Adjustor contains a passage worth quoting at length: Man is a physical and spiritual epitome of the universe. The spiritual is the cause of action. Action is life. The physical is that through which we see effects, changes. The spiritual always did exist, always will. It is eternal, it is changeless. The physical is transient, undergoing constant changes. The Spiritual is positive, the physical negative. The spiritual acts upon and through the physical. Man in his physical nature embodies the elements of the material universe. The spiritual controls the individualized portion we designate as an individual. The spirit manifests itself through the physical as a conscious intelligence. In the physical, man is of the earth, earthy. The spiritual is an individualized portion of Universal Intelligence\u2014 God\u2014just as the material man is a portion of the material universe. Through the five or more senses we take cognizance of and become acquainted with the physical world, its facts, laws and forces. Through the spiritual, by communication, we may receive intelligence from other spirits in or out of bodies. This linking together of the spiritual and physical, makes it our duty to keep the corporal frame in proper alignment, that the spirit may manifest itself in a natural manner. It is not only our inalienable right, but our moral duty to become acquainted with the osseous and nervous makeup, that we may intelligently adjust any displaced portion of the skeletal frame, so that Innate (that portion of Universal Intelligence usually known as spirit) may manifest itself through and take in a correct knowledge of the material world as the spiritual does of the physical.53 Before long an elaborate metaphysics undergirded D. D.'s understanding of science and the natural world. D. D. related cosmic forces to the structural anatomy of the spinal column, stressing the reality of the physical rather than its \"immaterial\" nature: Spirit, soul, mind and body\u2014four different entities. The first three are imponderable; the last ponderable. The first three cannot be weighed on scales, the latter can be. Spirit is God, the Eternal, the All Wise, the Universal Intelligence. Soul is life directed by an intelligence. The intelligence is the mind directed by Innate or Spirit. c h i r o p r a c t o r s o n p a r a d e 167 Vital functions constitute life. They create vegetative functions. Vital functions are an expression of the soul. The soul owes its existence to the spirit. The spirit can exist without the soul or body. The soul is dependent upon both spirit and body. Mind is dual in its nature; it is intelligence expressed by individualized spirit. Spirit furnishes mental force to run the vital and intellectual functions. The vital functions cause vegetative growth. The accumulated intelligence is acquired by the intellectual functions. The body is a physical structure of fixed shape. It is supported by a bony frame-work, having within it an assemblage of related organs, which in health, work in harmony. A body has a vascular, nervous, lymphatic, alimentary, dermoid, glandular, muscular and kinesodic system whether dead or alive.54 D. D. was foregrounding the spiritual dimensions of chiropractic, arguing that it justified a massive reorganization of scientific and philosophical truth. Chiropractic science included a systematic metaphysics that henceforth would be called \"Chiropractic Religio.\" Under this paradigm, the ultimate truths revealed by chiropractic were to be stated more explicitly, and the profession would be recognized as a form of spiritual healing. The development of these ideas was reflected most completely in an article entitled, \"The Moral and Religious Duty of a Chiropractor.\" It is very likely D. D. Palmer circulated copies of the essay; later it was included in the posthumous book compiled by his wife Molly. In the piece, D. D. made his case that chiropractic is a sacred healing art, that its practitioners are duty-bound by conscience, and that its science and philosophy hold unprecedented insights about the nature of reality. These elements, he argued, justified framing the practice as \"Chiropractic Religio,\" or the \"Religion of Chiropractic.\" D. D. wrote, \"Chiropractic has pulled aside the curtain of ignorance which obscured the cause of disease; in time it will lift the veil of superstition which has obstructed our vision of the great beyond. In time, spiritual existence will be as well known and comprehended as that of the physical world.\"55 The grandiosity of these announcements astounds. Tasked with interpreting D. D.'s mental world, I only can answer that his constant innovations to chiropractic theory indicate a deep existential longing. D. D. Palmer hoped to create an entirely new theory of human biology. He seems to have found a great sense of fulfillment in being a \"discoverer\" and bringing new knowledge to the world. D. D. gave Chiropractic Philosophy the status of revelation\u2014a connection D. D. stressed through his deliberate 168 c h i r o p r a c t o r s o n p a r a d e adoption of religious language: \"The New Theology enunciated by me more than ten years ago as the basis of Chiropractic, is the identification of God with Life-Force. The Intelligent Life-Force of Creation is God. It is individualized in each of us. It desires to express itself in the best manner possible. In every phase of life, vitality and action, man's highest aspiration should be to advance himself to a higher level, to make himself better mentally and physically. God\u2014The Universal Intelligence\u2014The Life-Force of Creation\u2014 has been struggling for countless ages to improve upon itself\u2014to express itself intellectually and physically higher in the scale of evolution.\"56 D. D. stressed the eternal spiritual dimensions of chiropractic theory, and explained that he had needed to reveal these truths gradually, in a way that the \"world\" would be ready to accept: \"In the early years of Chiropractic I used the terms Innate (Spirit), Innate Intelligence (Spiritual Intellect), Universal Intelligence (God), because they were comprehensive, and the world was not prepared to receive the latter terms just mentioned in parentheses. It may be, even now, premature to use them.\"57 D. D.'s attempt to construct a systematic theology of chiropractic generated several catechism-like documents. One, called \"The Triad,\" provides an especially rich example of this rhetorical style: Innate\u2014Soul\u2014Body. Innate\u2014Intelligent Life\u2014Body. Immaterial\u2014Vital\u2014Material. The life directed by intelligence is the soul (the life) of the body. The Soul (the life) is the symphysis which unites Spirit and Body. Without the connecting link, the Spiritual and Physical are separate and distinct from each other. Man is a part of Creation. Innate is a part of the Creator. Innate is the Creator of man before as well as after birth. Mother Innate builds before birth\u2014the individualized, personified Innate after birth. Innate is a part of The All Wise. Innate (Spirit) is a part of Universal Intelligence, individualized and personified. Innate desires to assist the Chiropractor in making a correct diagnosis. The Universal Intelligence, collectively or individualized, desires to express itself in the best manner possible. It has been struggling for c h i r o p r a c t o r s o n p a r a d e 169 countless ages to improve upon itself to express itself intellectually and physically higher in the scale of evolution. Man's aspirations should be to advance to a superior level, to make himself better, physically, mentally and spiritually. This marvelous existence of many systems, harmoniously associated and controlled by the I AM, constitutes the duality of man. The spirit was a living intelligence before it was united with the body. It will continue a living, intelligent entity after it is separated from it.58 These passages reflect the striking similarities between D. D. Palmer's Chiropractic Philosophy and the broader arc of American Metaphysics which posits a divine force connecting all reality. It is interesting to note similarities of language between D. D. and the Theosophist Elliot Coues, who wrote, \"I am bound to infer, and I do infer, that in my own case at least, life subsists in the union of soul and body; that life consists in the animation of matter by spirit; that life is God made consciously manifest.\"59 Similarly, Oliver Sabin, who identified himself as \"Bishop of the Evangelical Christian Science Church,\" affirmed, \"The life that runs in man, in the animal, in the plant, in the worlds, is God. It is God manifest everywhere. In all the conditions of life, in all the conditions of existence; everywhere that life is, that life is God.\"60 Physical healing had long been a leading expression of communion with the divine in the Harmonial traditions. Metaphysicians recast the boundaries separating the material world from spirit and consciousness by asserting that \"Thoughts are Things.\" Andrew Jackson Davis believed that \"matter and mind, which are two principles, move onward as essentially One substance.\"61 This premise opened the door to the possibility of changing material reality through thought. In particular, it established the body as a site for the realization of a distinct cosmogony. One's physical condition reflected one's \"state of mind.\" Warren Felt Evans explained, \"To think and to exist are one and the same. . . . Every disease is the translation into a bodily expression of a fixed idea of the mind and a morbid way of thinking. If by any therapeutic device you remove the morbid idea, which is the spiritual image after the likeness of which the body is formed, you cure the malady.\"62 D. D.'s worldview resonated with the Neoplatonic idealism characteristic of Metaphysical thought. Like other thinkers, he saw material reality as a manifestation of the spiritual: \"The universe is composed of matter and intelligence; the former is acted upon by the latter. All impulses of the planetary system and the animals which inhabit it, are directed by this universal 170 c h i r o p r a c t o r s o n p a r a d e intelligence which is individualized according to their needs.\"63 At the same time, D. D. held a commonsense understanding of \"matter\" as an established reality. He thought of bone, especially, as an unchanging material. This proposition upheld the superiority of the physical techniques of chiropractic over spiritual and mental healing, but it also was a distinct, personal response to Harmonial idealism. Since D. D.'s time, the position of \"Mind Through Matter\" has been strong in the thought of many Straight chiropractic \"greats,\" and it sets the profession against the consensus of American Metaphysicians. Straight chiropractors use the categories of matter and spirit \"antagonistically,\" so as to promote the treatment as a practical alternative to the abstract systems of mental healing in which matter and spirit are interchangeable.64 Chiropractic materiality allows for a commonsense understanding of the physical world. Treating matter as a hard fact, literally, means there is less of a breach to close between the imagined world of spirituality and the world of the physical senses. It involves the handling of physical bodies, and the conceptual prioritization of the most endurable parts of those bodies\u2014imperishable bone. And, incidentally, the reality of matter resolves an important question in Chiropractic theodicy. Why can't Innate Intelligence heal a subluxation? If the human body can recover from illness naturally, as chiropractors say, arguably there should be no need for their mediation. The \"immutability\" of bone, however, means chiropractors are important and effective \"assistants\" to the Healing Power of Nature. D. D. had the lifelong habit of incorporating any new idea that struck his fancy into his writing, the overall effect being that of a textual collage. As his vitalism became more spiritual, he dabbled in interpretations that were demonstrably Christian. In a passage on fetal development, he drew on the idea of a \"tripartite soul\" that, while originating in Aristotle, was given a much longer life as part of Catholic doctrine. The Aristotelian soul was a braided entity, with \"vegetative,\" \"animal,\" and \"rational\" principles working together to sustain the mind and body of a human being. This perspective distinguished involuntary bodily functioning from animal appetites, as D. D. did when he wrote, The Innate of the Mother runs all the functions of the embryo and fetus until delivery. The breath of life is evidence of the union existing between soul and body, the intelligent life, known in the Good Book as the soul, the symphasis [sic] which makes a triune of spirit, soul, and body. The vegetative function, guided by intelligence, constitutes life\u2014the soul. The cumulative function is forming an aggregation of c h i r o p r a c t o r s o n p a r a d e 171 likes and dislikes: angelic or fiendish; humane or brutal; polished or rude; sensitive or unfeeling; conscientious or cruel, which may continue through life and in a great measure determine thon's [sic] mental characteristics. The vegetative function is forming a body, that may be regular or deformed; comely or monstrous; attractive or hideous, depending upon the vital function for the energy which directs the vegetative, the builder of mind and body.\"65 Like many others, this passage raises questions about how D. D. viewed the human soul\u2014an important entity in both religious spheres and medical vitalism. It seems he drew on beliefs about \"body, mind and spirit,\" and more traditional Christian assumptions about the human soul. This combinatorial tendency led to inconsistencies in D. D.'s views on the animating spiritual forces within a person. The ambiguities in his correlations of chiropractic Intelligences to other religious idioms illustrates how \"Chiropractic Religio\" was still a work-in-progress at the time of D. D.'s death. It is very important not to overplay the religious dimensions of D. D.'s changing project. I believe he was at his most sincere when he offered the advice, \"Worship truth and justice\u2014you need no other God.\"66 D. D. Palmer was quite critical of organized religion, which he saw as the source of substantial human suffering.67 Furthermore, he could be hostile to rival spiritual healers. D. D. told readers of The Chiropractor Adjustor, \"The editor of this journal took a course in metaphysics, a systematic exposition of disease due to mental aberrations, mental phenomena which I could not grasp, therefore I could not make use of it.\"68 While curious about other systems and feeling a partial solidarity with them, he was suspicious of potential business competitors. Thus he praised John Alexander Dowie, a controversial faith healer, in the same breath that he called the leader of the Zion City, Illinois community a \"fanatic.\"69 It is not entirely clear why D. D. \"went public\" with a strongly Metaphysical interpretation of chiropractic. He may have refigured chiropractic as a religion in order to safeguard the practice from government regulation. D. D. also might have hoped to imitate the dramatic success of Christian Science and New Thought. A story circulates around the Palmer College of Chiropractic that D. D. Palmer once saw such strong similarities between his practice and Christian Science, that he wrote to Mary Baker Eddy and suggested they collaborate. Obviously, the legendary attempt to affiliate with Christian Science came to naught. Let me point out an interesting parallel between D. D. Palmer and A. T. Still, founder of osteopathy. Like chiropractic, osteopathy underwent a \"StraightMixer\" debate between traditional vitalists and a faction that embraced the 172 c h i r o p r a c t o r s o n p a r a d e new medical sciences. In osteopathy, the latter group won leadership of the profession, leading to a progressive accommodation with regular medicine. A. T. Still, as a Metaphysically oriented vitalist healer, found himself on the losing side of the debate. As he grew estranged from the profession he had created, Still became more vocally spiritual, presenting osteopathy as a \"philosophy\" that reconciled theology and biology. Life was a \"vivifying\" force, whose ultimate source was God. God, in turn was equal to the \"Mind of the universe.\"70 Like many Metaphysicians, Still believed in a \"Triune\" human nature, wherein each person was a tripartite self of \"body, mind, and spirit.\" He wrote, \"First, there is the material body; second, the spiritual being; third, a being of mind which is far superior to all vital motions and material forms, whose duty is to wisely manage this great engine of life.\"71 There are mysteries in Still's writing: ideas and terms with unclear origins. Chief among these was his notion of \"Biogen.\"72 This did not refer to any simple organic vital principle, but was Still's term for God-given, indwelling power. With it, he linked the material world to the spiritual, and enlarged osteopathy from a therapy to a cosmogony: All material bodies have life terrestrial and all space has life, ethereal or spiritual life. The two, when united, form man. Life terrestrial has motion and power; the celestial bodies have knowledge or wisdom. Biogen is the lives of the two in united action, that give motion and growth to all things. . . . A man, biogenic force, means both lives in united action to construct all bodies in form, with wisdom to govern their actions. Thus endowed, two beings or worlds, when in contact, give wisdom and force to work out greater problems than either could accomplish alone. As both have been formed by terrestrial forces aided by celestial wisdom, then greater results can be hoped for, and in friendly unison in action such results will appear as the effects of that harmonious union of two great causes. Thus biogen or material life of the two obeys the wisdom of the celestial mind or life. The result is faultless perfection, because the earth-life shows in material forms the wisdom of the God of the Celestial. Thus we say biogen or dual life, that life means eternal reciprocity that permeates all nature. The celestial worlds of space or ether-life gives forms wisely constructed in exchange for the use of the material substances. Reciprocity through the governments of the celestial and terrestrial worlds is ever the same, and human life, in form and motion, is the result of conception by the terrestrial mother from the celestial father. Thus we have a union of mind, matter, and life, or man.73 c h i r o p r a c t o r s o n p a r a d e 173 I think Still may have taken the term \"Biogen\" from the work of Elliott Coues, who broke away from Helena Blavatsky. Coues offered this definition in 1884: \"Biogen itself, of course, is alive; it is life; and biogen may be defined as spirit in combination with the minimum of matter necessary to its manifestation. Biogen is simply soul-stuff, as contradistinguished from ordinary matter; it is the substance which composes that thing which a well-known and very frequently quoted writer calls the 'spiritual body.' \"74 Though it is impossible to establish that Still was influenced by Coues's work, there are striking similarities in their language and ideas. At the very least, this should inspire more research on the therapeutic dimensions of Theosophy, which have not received much scholarly attention.75 A. T. Still and D. D. Palmer were each writing from a vantage point of \"displacement.\" Viewed synoptically, their life stories suggest that the radical spiritualization of irregular medicine was accomplished both through the formulation of healing systems and in individual lives. The trajectory of their ideas show this transition at a deeply human level. In the 1950s, Cyrus Lerner maintained that \"Chiropractic Philosophy\" was invented to put chiropractic on a religious footing, for the sole purpose of evading medical regulation.76 Lerner dismissed Innate Intelligence as D. D. Palmer's \"plank for erecting a religion.\" Since then, the thesis that the Palmers' Metaphysical chiropractic was largely strategic has remained attractive. It comports with other historians' findings about alternative healing, especially those of Rennie Schoepflin, who has shown how Mary Baker Eddy developed the church-like elements of Christian Science after she and her trainees encountered too many difficulties operating as proprietary \"spiritual healing practitioners.\"77 \"Chiropractic Religio\" was invoked as a defense in at least one court case. Heinrich Dueringer, a Palmer graduate practicing in Manhattan was arrested in 1911 in a \"sting\" conducted by the New York County Medical Society. During the trial the following September, the defense showed D. D.'s article \"The Moral and Religious Duty of a Chiropractor\" as evidence for the \"church of Chiropractic.\"78 The court, however, was skeptical, as was the author of the New York Times story about Dueringer's trial. The unnamed journalist raised an important point: most Americans were uncomfortable with the idea that one could do spiritual \"work\" on a \"for-hire\" basis. This may be one of the reasons \"Chiropractic Religio\" never took off. In addition, it may speak to a \"natural cap\" on the growth of systems like Christian Science or Mind Cure, in which healing services are proprietary. 174 c h i r o p r a c t o r s o n p a r a d e p r o g r e s s at t h e p s c Max Weber observed that as organizational systems develop, their beliefs proliferate and grow more elaborate. Since the time of the Palmers, chiropractors have divided the fundamentals of their profession into the categories of art, science, and philosophy. In Davenport, B. J. and his associates were hard at work building all three spheres of knowledge. For the pioneers, chiropractic research became a type of lay-scientific discovery. At the Palmer Infirmary, they embarked on an ambitious program of clinical research, which delivered what they saw as remarkable breakthroughs. Subluxations, the bone displacements that pressed on or otherwise affected the nerves in the spinal column, were identified as the real cause of devastating illnesses like cancer, leprosy, tetanus, and rabies.79 One chiropractor's studies on \"nerve tracing\" found spinal displacements could predispose certain bodily sites to injury, \"causing\" wounds and trauma.80 Chiropractic also was found to have therapeutic benefits for common, irritating ailments like the common cold, arthritis, kidney stones, and constipation.81 One important innovation dating to this time was B. J.'s discovery of the \"Direct Mental Impulse.\" Around 1908, he reinterpreted the pathways of the cranial nerves, asserting that they joined the spine before arriving at the brain stem. All the nerves of the body were therefore subordinated to the spinal cord, which \"directly\" communicated with the brain. This was an important step in creating a comprehensive chiropractic theory of disease, and it provoked an enormous reaction from D. D. He challenged B. J.'s science, himself insisting that cranial nerves were connected to the spinal cord by \"Communicating Nerves.\"82 The Palmers' theories tilted with mainstream scientific knowledge, and present-day anatomists would regard each of them as incorrect. Both Palmers were reconfiguring structural biology so as to redraw the contours of the human form itself. \"Direct Mental Impulse\" was the focus of many of D. D.'s invectives against B. J. in his chiropractic textbook, but their divergent scientific views were not the only source of tension.83 Proprietary issues were also at stake. D. D. accused B. J. of changing his words in the texts to which B. J. held copyright, making it appear that D. D. also supported Direct Mental Impulse. And indeed, later editions of The Science of Chiropractic and The Chiropractor's Adjuster prove his charge. B. J. revised much of his father's writing in later editions of The Science of Chiropractic; and when the Palmer School of Chiropractic reprinted D. D.'s Chiropractor Adjuster in 1921, B. J. deleted much of the material on tone and vibration.84 Meanwhile, B. J. vaunted his adherence to the Second Theory as evidence that he had stayed true to chiropractic even as his father had abandoned it. The dispute stands out as an c h i r o p r a c t o r s o n p a r a d e 175 example of alterations B. J. made to his father's writing and unveils an important facet of B. J.'s character: the frequent discrepancies between his statements and the reality they concealed. Between 1909 and 1912, chiropractors at Palmer developed the \"Meric\" system as a framework for the comprehensive treatment of disease.85 B. J. and co-creator J. C. Wishart drew on an idea that had been popular through much of the nineteenth century, as \"spinal charts\" in popular health literature attest. Meric theory asserted that different \"zones\" of the spine were connected to particular organs or tissues.86 It followed the vertebral vitalist paradigm of associating different illnesses and conditions with specific vertebrae and their respective spinal nerves. Meric was one of the earliest versions of \"Meridian theory,\" which is a staple of the profession today. The logic underpinning Meric chiropractic, like its vitalist predecessors, differed from that governing modern science. B. J.'s conception of relevant information was also different, as is seen in his description of Meric symptomatology: \"Under the meric system, it is immaterial to know what extent, degree or in particular manner a place may be affected. The location of where a trouble is serves as a guide to tell the expert where the cause of the trouble is; proving the location of the effect will prove the location of the cause.\"87 B. J. had distinct interpretations and standards for principles such as causality, relationship, and evidence. Meric thus sounded another Klaxon, then still distant. B. J. was toying with an alternative epistemology that could challenge the scientific method\u2014 as he did in a 1915 publication called Induction vs. Deduction.88 Like D. D., B. J. used carefully selected language to reinforce differences between chiropractic and regular medicine. In the Progressive Era, the base of charges filed against drugless healers for practicing medicine illegally often turned on whether they had described their services as the \"diagnosis,\" \"treatment,\" or \"cure\" of illnesses. In truth, D. D. did make such statements in his early advertorials, though he later denied this vehemently. In B. J.'s time, the expansion of chiropractic involved the strategic use of terms such as \"adjust,\" \"analyze,\" and \"removal of the cause\" of disease.89 These word choices, however, were more than rhetorical strategies. They show how chiropractors\u2014and not only B. J.\u2014 believed their practice was fundamentally different from regular medicine. On this point, even B. J.'s rivals agreed with him, as did a Mixer who proclaimed, \"The basis of Chiropractic in the care of disease processes is so different from all other systems of healing, that this science has no relation to present-day medicine, and is destined to bring about a tremendous reform in the art of healing.\"90 B. J. and his associates also revised chiropractic therapeutics. The \"Palmer Toggle-Recoil\" adjustment became a signature technique for B. J.'s brand. It was 176 c h i r o p r a c t o r s o n p a r a d e 1918 Meric spinal chart. Mabel Palmer's anatomical research supported the theories of her husband, B. J. Palmer. This diagram, from her Anatomy textbook, affirms Meric theory by showing routes from the spinal nerves to other parts of the body. Archives, David D. Palmer Health Sciences Library/Palmer College of Chiropractic. important to establish Palmer chiropractic as unique, for across the country chiropractors and chiropractic colleges were springing up like mushrooms. From 1909 to 1915 alone, at least 40 schools were in operation. Most of these schools were ephemeral, but a few survived to become some of the most prestigious training centers for chiropractic and alternative medicine in the United States today. Nearly all were proprietary institutions, but otherwise they reflected the diversity of the growing chiropractic world. Straight and Mixer factions had distinct understandings of how chiropractic should be related to other forms of healing. Most chiropractic leaders prioritized spinal adjustment, but many felt the practice should be added to the array of vitalist therapies associated with nineteenth-century health reform, like diet and water therapy. It is revealing that during the time, chiropractic was taught at the American College of Mechano-Therapy in Chicago, Hewitt Academy of Healing Science in St. Paul, Minnesota, and the Blumer College of Natureopathy in Hartford, Connecticut. Following a path set by the American School, rivals of the Palmers sought to build their own professional infrastructure. They printed advertorials and weekly papers. Some wrote \"textbooks\"\u2014a few of these, like Carver's Chiropractic Analysis, were published even before D. D. completed the Chiropractor's Adjuster.91 Professional growth made for an burgeoning market in chiropractic products, too. Chiropractors supplemented their income by selling patient literature, spinal charts, and other equipment. The Chiropractic Supply Company, based in Davenport, promoted its office lamp with the premium of a \"Conveniently Grouped Arrangement of over 1000 Questions Very Successfully Used in Preparing for Chiropractic State Board Examinations.\" Special tables, for adjusting or \"spinal traction\" became more popular, as companies pushed the sale of options like \"The Stretcher.\"92 Ominously for D. D. and B. J., not all chiropractors regarded the Palmers as authoritative\u2014or even as the rightful creators of chiropractic. The Text-Book of Chiropractic by William Charles Schulze repeated the assertions of the American School that chiropractic derived from Napravit, and did not mention the Palmers at all.93 Moreover, a number of health innovators regarded the chiropractic discovery as a predecessor to their own systems. As the twentieth century began its second decade, a new crop of vertebral vitalisms emerged, with colorful names like \"Cosmotherapy,\" \"Neuropathy,\" \"Spinology,\" \"Spinaltherapy,\" and the \"Cooley Way.\"94 Increasing business competition prompted B. J. to respond defensively and act preemptively, when possible. Although he resisted the adoption of the traction devices associated with Mixers like Solon Langworthy, B. J. began to market the \"Hylo Adjusting Table\" in 1910.95 A year later, the success of the 178 c h i r o p r a c t o r s o n p a r a d e home-study courses offered by National School of Chiropractic led him to start the Palmer School of Correspondence. At Palmer, the Meric system soon was followed by further modifications of chiropractic theory and technique.96 B. J. and his colleagues focused their attention on ever fewer vertebrae, seeing the effects of subluxations in certain bones as more pernicious than others. \"Majors and Minors\" theory identified particular vertebrae in each Meric zone, or \"vertemere,\" as optimal sites for adjustment.97 It prioritized the cervical vertebrae, especially the atlas. By the 1920s, B. J. advocated upper-cervical adjustment for almost every condition. l o c a l r i va l r i e s , n at i o n a l c o m p e t i t i o n Joy Loban was one of the main contributors to these new technical concepts, and he is credited, especially, with the development of \"Palmer Specific Upper Cervical\" adjustment. Beyond the official acknowledgments in histories of chiropractic, however, the progression of ideas and the names associated with these advancements may offer a clue to his bitter break with B. J. in 1910. Loban's ideas about the \"Spino-Organic Connection,\" published in his 1912 book the Technic and Practice of Chiropractic, closely resembled\u2014and appear to have preceded\u2014 the \"Majors and Minors\" paradigm that B. J. announced a few years later.98 Given the long history of chiropractors' competition for the ownership of knowledge, it is possible such a dispute ended Loban's association with B. J. But other reasons for Loban's break with B. J. have also been proposed. Years later, a chiropractor who taught at Palmer when the split occurred attributed it to disagreements about the curriculum, specifically on the teaching of \"Diagnosis,\" \"Symptomatology,\" and \"Pathology.\"99 It is likely that the introduction of the x-ray played a part. B. J.'s passion for all things mechanical sparked his interest in x-ray machines, which he introduced at Palmer in 1910.100 Today, the x-ray is part of the standard chiropractic repertoire, although its use remains controversial. Chiropractors were divided over the introduction of a modern, distinctly medical piece of equipment. Some also feared B. J.'s plan to incorporate x-rays into chiropractic was ominously similar to the contracts that health entrepreneurs used to lease questionable medical devices in order to maximize their profit from a straight sale of the equipment. We do not know whether Joy Loban opposed x-rays, but in the spring of 1910 he abruptly resigned from the Palmer School, to open one of his own, the Universal Chiropractic College\u2014also on Brady Street. Soon after, in a c h i r o p r a c t o r s o n p a r a d e 179 coordinated secession, fifty students marched out of one of B. J.'s lectures and down the hill to Loban's institution. The physical locations of the two colleges\u2014virtually across the street from each other\u2014is highly symbolic. For the next few years, UCC would be the primary rival to Palmer College. In 1912 faculty at UCC started the International Chiropractic Association, an organization meant to rival B. J.'s Universal Chiropractic Association. Let it never be said that kinship does not generate a confusion of names. The Universal College of Chiropractic stayed in Davenport through 1918. After UCC left Davenport, the \"Chiropractic College\" building on Brady Street had a second chiropractic tenant, the \"Davenport School of Chiropractic.\" This institute, run by R. Truman Smith, appears to have lasted only a year. Fallings-out like the ones between the Palmers and their former students are frequent in the chiropractic subculture. Such schisms characterize many alternative religions, especially Harmonial traditions. Leaders in \"Spiritual Religion\" were and continue to be autocratic. While innovative in their business practices and creative in their syntheses of scientific and philosophical information, many such figures prove unable to collaborate intellectually or socially. Thus the histories of alternative spiritual and health movements are racked by recurring fragmentation, much of it due to conflict between autocratic leaders and \"seconds\" or deputies who demonstrate similar personality traits. After the walkout, Loban found an ally in D. D. Palmer, who opposed x-rays on the grounds that their heat damaged body tissues and caused \"cellular degeneration.\"101 Nonetheless, Loban's disengagement from Chiropractic Philosophy cautions against overestimating his role in its development. Published in 1912, Loban's book, Technic and Practice of Chiropractic, shows the trajectory of his ideas. He was emphatic in affirming the basic vitalist premise: \"Chiropractic maintains that all the chemical and physical activities of the human organism are controlled, directly or indirectly, by a third form of energy transmitted through the nervous system. That while all three forms of energy are interdependent and closely related in their ultimate expression, one of the three is the primary and most essential form and especially indicative of life. We may call this third form Vital Energy.\"102 Chiropractic Philosophy, however, was conspicuously absent. Loban may have omitted it as a means of distancing his own project from B. J.'s. Rather than promote an elaborate metaphysics, Loban's new goal was to place chiropractic on a firm scientific footing, evident in the technical flavor of his prose: \"Chiropractic has accepted as a convenient working hypothesis the proposition that all disease in the human body is primarily made possible by injury to, stimulation or inhibition of some part of the nervous mechanism. . . . 180 c h i r o p r a c t o r s o n p a r a d e The fact, not known to Science in general and asserted by Chiropractic is simply that the subluxation is the factor which determined susceptibility [to disease].\"103 Loban was using modern medical ideas to recast vertebral vitalism, with many continuities. In fact, some of the diagrams in Technic and Practice were strikingly similar to nineteenth-century spinal charts. Nonetheless, Loban and other chiropractic pioneers believed they were on the cutting edge of scientific discovery. This outlook persists today among some chiropractors, who engage with science on their own terms. b o o s t i n g c h i r o p r a c t i c : b . j . pa l m e r a n d p o p u l a r i n t e l l e c t u a l c u lt u r e Even with Universal Chiropractic College competing for enrollment close by, the Palmer School had 687 students in 1911.104 The tuition enabled B. J. and Mabel to pay $25,000 for a twenty-two-room house in Davenport.105 The three-story Victorian already was impressive at the time of purchase. Over the next ten years the Palmers greatly expanded the residence, adding a greenhouse and a garden courtyard. The \"Palmer Mansion\" grew famous for its decor. The downstairs was filled with Asian art. The varnished trunk of a large oak tree was a central feature of the living room, its branches making natural rafters to the ceiling. Later, after his favorite dog died, B. J. had the Saint Bernard stuffed and placed beneath the grand piano. Guests were unnerved when they learned that \"Big Ben\" was, in fact, dead. The full impact of these custom modifications was a few years away, but some preferences were already set, including the furniture, distinctive in the Arts and Crafts style. I already have mentioned the fondness of popular intellectuals for the Arts and Crafts movement. The style had an added personal significance for B. J.: he associated it not only with the creative populism of its industrial arts, but specifically with the Roycroft Community and its leader Elbert Hubbard, whom he regarded as a mentor. Elbert Hubbard was the producer of two magazines, The Philistine and The Fra, as well as founder of the Arts and Crafts cooperative, the Roycroft Community.106 Hubbard gave a public lecture in Davenport in 1906. It is not clear whether he and B. J. met then, but their friendship developed very quickly after 1908. Hubbard's ideas were eclectic, but consistent with the populism characteristic of the Progressive Era. Hubbard was staunchly pro-business and his faith in meritocracy approached Social Darwinism. His support of both free enterprise and personal creativity led him to invite aspiring artisans and creators to set up shop on his property in upstate New York, and thus the Roycroft c h i r o p r a c t o r s o n p a r a d e 181 B. J. salvaged a tree trunk from Palmer campus for the support beams in the living room of Palmer Mansion. Archives, David D. Palmer Health Sciences Library/Palmer College of Chiropractic. Community was born. As a result, he has been considered both a socialist and a libertarian, but neither label is accurate. Above all, Hubbard was an intentional contrarian. Even by the gentle standards of the early twentieth century, his appearance was somewhat strange. His blouse-like shirts, floppy hats and bow ties resembled those worn by the comic strip character, \"Buster Brown.\" He also favored buckskin jackets like those worn by \"Buffalo Bill,\" and like the Western celebrity, he wore his hair long. His clothing and grooming choices celebrated the individualism he felt was central to the American spirit.107 Although the son of a physician, Elbert Hubbard was a strong critic of organized medicine, and on this he found a natural ally in B. J. When Hubbard gave B. J. his first black tie, he probably did not know he was also bequeathing the whole of his sartorial legacy, including the hairstyle.108 Hubbard represented the father figure B. J. longed for and felt he never had. Hubbard died on the Lusitania in 1915, but B. J. copied the older man's distinctive style for many years. 182 c h i r o p r a c t o r s o n p a r a d e B. J. also emulated Elbert Hubbard when he bought several printing presses and typesetting machines. B. J. used the Palmer Printery to generate large quantities of chiropractic literature. The 1906 Science of Chiropractic soon was followed by many other volumes authored by B. J. and instructors at the Palmer School. Numbering almost forty volumes, they became known first as the \"Science of Chiropractic\" series, and later as the \"Green Books.\" B. J. hoped the collection would become the basis of a canon of chiropractic literature. Today, some Super Straight chiropractors regard the Green Books as authoritative texts, comparable to religious scripture. In 1912 the Palmer Printery began publishing the Fountain Head News, which for decades was the most sonorous trumpet of B. J.'s message. The dynamic use of capitalization and typefaces made his texts interesting to look at, even while it caused doubts about the order of his mind. Because publicity was the main goal, the paper was first offered free, and then at the low price of 25 cents an issue. This was one reason the Palmer Printery seldom turned a profit, and often lost money.109 To focus on its commercial failings, though, is to miss the real significance of the Printery. It was an outlet of creative expression for B. J. and the other chiropractors whose work it published. B. J.'s work with the Printery was what the anthropologist Clifford Geertz would call a \"meaning-making\" activity.110 The print revolution of the nineteenth century culminated in the consolidation of the publishing industry into large, corporate powerhouses. Ironically, while print culture boomed, printers and independent publishers were hit very hard by changes in the market. Typesetting machines like the Linograph were a dramatic efficiency that also cost thousands of typesetters their jobs. Independent printers might be hired for handbills and sign production, but were increasingly pushed out of book publishing. Several historians have interpreted artisanal printing, or the \"private press\" movement, as a protest against the anonymity of industrialism and bureaucracy.111 Not only did the content of the independent press incubate cultural dissent, but the forms of artisanal printing also were intended as material challenges to the standardization of mass-production. \"Natural\" paper, antique typefaces, and old-fashioned printing presses were popular among private-press operators. Dissenting radicals had similar preferences. The social meaning of these devices was driven home for me several years ago, when I salvaged dozens of copies of The Philistine from a trash bin at Union Theological Seminary. I had never seen anything like these little booklets printed on heavy cardstock, small and nearly square. Some of the text was in a medieval-style typeface, the heavy black text accented with details in bright red. The covers were c h i r o p r a c t o r s o n p a r a d e 183 decorated with the floral designs and scrollwork that Roycroft printers helped make famous. Epigrams were printed on the front and back, and others appeared throughout the booklets themselves. I learned that many of these were by the writer Stephen Crane. The Philistine's content was diverse, making it hard to detect an editorial slant. Much of the prose was in \"reformed spelling,\" which increased the mystery. Though they had disintegrated with age and bore an off-putting title, the booklets were captivatingly beautiful. The chiropractic literature produced at Palmer was intentionally modeled on the Roycroft style, with cardstock covers, antique bindings, Gutenberg fonts, and the decorations and border ornaments printers call \"dingbats.\" In the same spirit, B. J. attempted to transform the manufacturing process as well. B. J. considered the Palmer Printery to be \"the prettiest printing plant in America.\" By all accounts, the press was a legitimate contender for that honor. The physical plant was humanized with ferns, birds in cages, and statues of great men like Socrates, Shakespeare, and Mark Twain. The equipment, however, was top-line: by the 1940s, there would be a Miehle Cylinder Press, one of the most popular commercial book presses, as well as \"three small automatic feeder presses; one small off-set and one large off-set automatic feeder and stacker press; four small Kelly and two large Kelly presses, all automatic feeders and stackers.\"112 Still, the Palmer Printery would prove limited in its capacity. As B. J.'s writing projects grew more ambitious, he began to outsource their production. In fact, B. J.'s two travel books and many volumes in the Green Books series were printed by the large corporate subsidy publisher, R. R. Donnelley. The greatest outlet for B. J.'s creativity was Chiropractic Philosophy. Much of B. J.'s self-promotion hinged on his insistence that he was the true guardian of his father's ideas. This is an important claim to monitor when sorting out their relationship. Despite their personal conflict and differences on certain theoretical points, D. D. and B. J. largely agreed on the principles of Chiropractic Philosophy. B. J. did create his own vocabulary, filled with colorful metaphors, for the concepts of Chiropractic Philosophy, but the trinity of \"Intelligences\" remained constant across D. D. and B. J.'s writing. One can see similar continuities and progressions in their respective systems of thought. Like D. D., B. J. now ascribed divine qualities to Universal Intelligence, noting that \"God, or Universal Intelligence, are equivalent.\"113 Like D. D., B. J. seems to have evaluated changing the epistemological orientation of chiropractic from science to religion. B. J. described his understanding of the religious dimensions of chiropractic in a public address scheduled for late October 1908. In the piece, he stated that during the previous year he had sought to convert the profession. B. J. was aware of the 184 c h i r o p r a c t o r s o n p a r a d e The Palmer Printery in the 1930s. B. J. Palmer chose to outsource the printing of many of his major books, but the Palmer Printery issued the Fountain Head News until 1961. Archives, David D. Palmer Health Sciences Library/Palmer College of Chiropractic. protections obtained by Christian Science under the First Amendment. Equally as important, he saw chiropractic as the evolutionary reinterpretation of religion through science (or B. J.'s notion of science): Last fall, a year ago, I was very much determined to convert Chiropractic to a religion. Do not misunderstand the statement! It was not hasty; there was a well thought out plan. First and foremost was the good of the p hilosopher in this form: The aim of all religions today is to teach men that an Almighty Being is above all. This is taught by one man going to a college and other professors telling him in scientific form and logic her [sic] great a Fellow is above us, and this man is ordained as a minister; goes into the field and begins a ministry of the gospel; of goodness of the Supreme Being. We look over the world of religions in every form and they preach the goodness of this Fellow, but when we come to study religion, it has no scientific ending; c h i r o p r a c t o r s o n p a r a d e 185 no further deductions other than to try to impress upon your mind (from other man's mind) what a fine Creator we have . . . Now, here comes along a little philosophy which says, \"We hold the key that turns the lock that has kept the soul away from the physical\u2014by turning the key which unlocks the door between the two, they unite and clasp hands inseparably. Now in this union we have accomplished all that religion has been trying to do for centuries; therefore if religion can be measured by the work delivered; by the accomplished objects; by the results [demonstrated], then certainly Chiropractic is all that any religion is. . . . We have had men in all ages who have advocated philosophies for all time to come, but how have never demonstrated any science or art to go with it, and with this thought in view, I still maintain that if a religion must be judged by results, then we should take an important place in the world of arts, science, or philosophies of today. . . . There is only ONE religion; only one philosophy; only one art; in other words, this is singled down to one basic principl[e]. A religion of the universality of an Intellectual Creative Power; a religion of doing good to fellow man; the only science, or philosophy that man can give to another that does him good is to assist him to reach the aim just spoken of\u2014your art is but the form in which you assist this man to reach higher planes in his search for power, therefore the various differences that exist are but the various ways of trying to get at the same thing\u2014there is only one religion.114 B. J.'s interest in religion provoked D. D. less than other aspects of his involvement in chiropractic. This owed much to D. D.'s belief that reframing chiropractic in religious terms would restore his rightful leadership of the profession. He declared this hope to P. W. Johnson when, evaluating the success of the UCA campaign to \"Go to Jail for Chiropractic,\" he wrote, We will have to build a boat similar to Christian Science and hoist a religious flag. I have received chiropractic from the other world, similar as did Mrs. Eddy. No other one has laid claim to that, NOT EVEN B. J. Exemption clauses instead of chiro laws by all means, and LET THAT EXEMPTION BE THE RIGHT TO PRACTICE OUR RELIGION. But we must have a religious head, one who is the founder, as did Christ, Mohamed, Jo. Smith, Mrs. Eddy, Martin Luther and others who have founded religions. I am the fountain head. I am the founder of chiropractic in its science, in its art, in its philosophy and in its religious phase. Now, if chiropractors desire to claim me as their head, their 186 c h i r o p r a c t o r s o n p a r a d e leader, the way is clear. My writings have been gradually steering in that direction until now it is time to assume that we have the same right to as has Christian Scientists. Oregon is free to Chiropractors. California gives Chiropractors only one chance, that of practicing our religion. The protective policy of the UCA is O.K., but that of religion is far better. The latter can only be assumed by having a leader, a head, a person who has received chiropractic as a science, as an art, as a philosophy and as a religion. Do you catch on? The policy of the UCA is the best that B. J. can be at the head of, BUT THE RELIGIOUS MOVE IS FAR BETTER, but we must incorporate under the man who received the principles of chiropractic from the other world.115 Despite the messianic overtones of his self-promotion, D. D. was well aware of the gap between hope and reality in millenarianism. In the same letter, he complained about the reception of his message thus far: \"I occupy in chiropractic a similar position as did Mrs. Eddy in Christian Science. . . . It is STRANGE TO ME WHY EVERY CHIROPRACTOR DOES NOT WANT A COPY OF MY BOOK.\" going home D. D. and Molly moved to Los Angeles in the spring of 1911. In April they bought a house on West Vernon Avenue and lived there some of the time.116 While D. D. was teaching at the Ratledge School of Chiropractic, however, they stayed in an apartment closer to the school.117 D. D.'s arrival in the Bunker Hill neighborhood was memorable to Frank Elliott, a young chiropractor hoping to build a practice in Los Angeles. Elliott was discomfited when his new neighbor on Grand Avenue opened a chiropractic office next door, but they managed to develop a cordial professional friendship. \"It was not long till we were in daily conversations. When he found out I was from the PSC, he began to 'educate' me on the 'facts' about his 'raw deal' from his son B. J. On the occasion, in his apartment in the presence of his wife, he was berating B. J. and telling me his angle of the reasons for his leaving Davenport. He became almost wild and highly excited and made statements which I knew were untrue. So I had heard enough and I let him have the facts as I knew them to be true. His wife Molly agreed with me and that made him more bitter than ever toward B. J. He made many very derogatory statements about his son and did not seem rational.\"118 c h i r o p r a c t o r s o n p a r a d e 187 The animosity ruffled Elliott, who was both a Palmer graduate and a cousin to B. J.'s wife Mabel. It is to his credit that he and D. D. maintained their friendship. When B. J. and Mabel visited Los Angeles in June, they stayed with him, right next door to D. D. and Molly. Apparently out of concern for D. D.'s resentment of B. J., Elliott prevented a face-to-face meeting, but he reported that, in a possible gesture of care taking, D. D. swept the sidewalk below the window of the guest room each morning until B. J. and Mabel returned to Iowa.119 On his own side of the wall, though, D. D. loved his Grand Avenue apartment, which was full of gadgets and modern conveniences. It elicited a domestic sensibility one would not think to associate with his cantankerous nature. \"We have a flat built on the California style. . . . It is the handiest house we ever lived in. . . . We did keep 50 hens, but, Mrs. Palmer was always fussing about my being dirty, so we cut the chickens out. . . . . This is our second winter here. Have not seen a flake of snow. Can see snow on the mountains. I have seen all the cold weather, slush and snow I care to see.\"120 Although based in Los Angeles, D. D. continued to travel quite a bit. He sometimes even returned to Davenport, where he gave guest lectures at Universal Chiropractic College.121 This was one example of D. D.'s tendency to strike back at B. J. by supporting rival chiropractors and their respective colleges. The older Palmer believed chiropractic had been stolen from him. This reality hung as a cloud over a homecoming event at the Palmer School in August 1913. B. J. invested a great deal in the first annual \"Lyceum.\" Lectures, entertainments, and a chiropractic parade were scheduled for Palmer students and graduates. The name of the event referenced the social clubs devoted to public education that were popular through much of the nineteenth century, but this homecoming was actually a swirl of showy popular culture, \"edutainment,\" and earnest academic achievement. Daniel Boorstin draws a useful connection, highlighting irregular practitioners' propensity for self-promotion.122 Boorstin presents eclectic physician Daniel Drake, founder of the Ohio Medical College, as the epitome of \"boosterism,\" a theme that resonates in the Palmers' biographies as well. Like the Palmers, Drake had no conceptual distinction between his own and the social good. And like Boorstin's \"boosters,\" the Palmers were prone to hyperbole and tall tales.123 Clues in B. J.'s notes from several years before speak to the colorful structure of the \"Lyceum\" programming, and to the significance the event had for him. In 1908 B. J. had been invited to speak at the First Annual Convention of the National Association of Suggestive Therapeutics, held at the Weltmer Institute in Nevada, Missouri.124 Mabel, Joy Loban, and a recording secretary referred 188 c h i r o p r a c t o r s o n p a r a d e to as \"Miss Mead\" accompanied him. Along with lectures by h ypnotists and other \"suggestive therapeutists,\" the \"Convention\" included dramatic presentations, music, and other nineteenth-century amusements. \"Miss Mead\" observed that the highlight was a talk by the cartoonist Richard Felton Outcault, known for The Yellow Kid and Buster Brown. B. J. was open in his admiration for the Weltmer establishment. Mead related, \"Dr. Palmer promises a better institution in five years for Chiropractic.\" Five years later, B. J.'s celebration was intended to signal the arrival of the chiropractic profession and his own role in that accomplishment. In fact, the \"Lyceum\" would mark a different kind of occasion: the final collapse of the relationship between father and son in a series of dramatic events.125 B. J. did not want his father to attend the August homecoming, but D. D. arrived in the Quad Cities a few days before the festivities. He may have intended to disrupt the Lyceum. Regardless, it would have been awkward to withhold an invitation with D. D. so close by. In Rock Island, D. D. was visited by Frank Elliott and a family friend who hoped to broker a peace agreement. D. D. agreed to stay in the Palmer Mansion as B. J.'s guest. Elliott commented, \"He promised to be good and not start any arguments and we assured him that B. J. would be a kind and courteous host.\" For what may have been little more than one summer afternoon, they settled into the traditional roles of parent and child. They were able to sit together for a family photograph with B. J.'s young son, Dave. The peace was short-lived. It is unclear how things unfolded at the Lyceum opening ceremonies, but an argument broke out at the parade when D. D. insisted on walking at the head of the procession. What had for years been a symbolic battle for leadership became literal. B. J. was driving one of the front cars. Some accounts of the incident report that B. J. asked his father to ride alongside him; other versions say that a special car was assigned just to D. D. so that he need not walk. These may be rehabilitating details, added after the fact. Words were exchanged as the regiment of chiropractors marched down Brady Street, when D. D. suddenly fell or was knocked to the curb. Although the evidence suggests that he actually stumbled, witnesses later accused B. J. of running his father down in a deliberate attack. D. D. was well enough to leave Davenport by train shortly afterward. On October 20, he died at home in Los Angeles at the age of 68 years. The official cause of death was reported as typhus, but within days news of the auto accident began to circulate. Even the Los Angeles Times ran a story blaming the August incident for ruining D. D.'s health.126 Chiropractors close to D. D. believed the fall caused a spinal subluxation, which was the true cause of the typhus that allegedly killed him. c h i r o p r a c t o r s o n p a r a d e 189 While this explanation seems implausible, it was very consistent with early-twentieth-century chiropractic theory. Spinal disruptions were implicated in contagious disease either by weakening resistance and allowing pathogenic infection to take hold, or by directly causing the illness; in this second understanding bacteria were believed to be harmless and naturally occurring in the body. Though chiropractors did not use the terms by which they are known, centuries-old medical ideas, like the doctrine of sympathies, and nervous \"irritation,\" are foundational to this logic. Such beliefs were still part of some Americans' lay health understandings, and were one of the reasons it took decades for germ theory to become the dominant health paradigm.127 Events surrounding D. D.'s death reflect the deterioration of the Palmers' relationship as well as the incipient resentment of B. J.'s leadership in some chiropractic factions. D. D. may have left instructions to sue B. J. for wrongful death, and to bar him from D. D.'s funeral in California. A memorial service was held on the same day at the Palmer School. Although B. J. ordered the flags to be flown at half-mast, a closer index of his reaction might be found in the first lines of his report on the service, which ran in the Fountain Head News: \"The troubles are now buried; they exist only in memory. The things good come to the front. His flesh no more is animated by spirit; but, long live the spirit. He gave birth to Chiropractic. It did not die with him. He gave it to you and I to carry on.\"128 B. J. spoke too soon. Joy Loban was named executor of D. D.'s will. In keeping with D. D.'s wishes, he and other UCC administrators sought the indictment of the younger Palmer, arguing not only that the collision brought on the fatal illness, but the collision itself was no accident. Nor, they alleged, was this simply an act of manslaughter\u2014it was a premeditated crime. And so, in 1914, a grand jury was convened three times in Davenport. Acting on behalf of D. D.'s estate, plaintiffs sought damages of $50,000. In one round of inquiry, the Scott County prosecutor attempted to add a charge of first-degree murder. The case never went to trial. The plaintiffs dropped their charges that December, though rumors circulated for years.129 B. J. went on to defend himself in a book entitled, With Malice Aforethought. Even without his manifesto, however, the profession was eager to make the conflict part of the past. In 1915 B. J. was largely vindicated at the Universal Chiropractors Association convention in Chicago, when Sol Long, the attorney who worked with Joy Loban in the lawsuit, publicly apologized. Long proclaimed B. J. the leader of the chiropractic profession and presented him with several of D. D. Palmer's belongings. These included a badge once worn by D. D., which Long pinned on B. J. in a gesture resembling a coronation.130 It was B. J.'s turn to lead the procession. 190 c h i r o p r a c t o r s o n p a r a d e chapter six h i s t o r y r e p e at s You could go on making analysis after analysis of his many activities and of the numerous roles he assumed during his lifetime. You will find a paradox in his behavior. You will find an inconsistency. You will find that there is a baffling aspect to everything he undertook to do. Sometimes you feel you are seeing the real B. J.\u2014then you look at what he has said or done\u2014and you are mystified. It is not him at all. \u2014Cyrus Lerner, \"Report on the History of Chiropractic,\" 295 o n to p o f t h e wo r l d The last the world would hear for years about D. D. Palmer's version of chiropractic was in a book posthumously published by D. D.'s wife, Mary, in 1914. Many of the articles in The Chiropractor addressed human biology from the perspective of D. D.'s \"tonal\" theory. The collection also included \"The Moral and Religious Duty of a Chiropractor,\" which D. D. had circulated, but most of the pieces were previously unpublished.1 Some chiropractors have doubts about its reliability, because D. D. did not edit or authorize the volume. The work is granted less authority than D. D.'s other writings in the chiropractic world. The articles reinforced D. D.'s Third Theory, based on tone and vibration, which never gained a large following. The overwhelming majority of chiropractors stuck to the Second Theory, with the nerves viewed as channels rather than strings. Vibratory chiropractic is a small stream in the modern profession, but it has endured. This may be because vibration theory sounds chords throughout Western alternative spirituality. If D. D.'s day was past, B. J. Palmer was hitting his stride as a chiropractic leader. He was, if not the \"last man standing\" among early chiropractic leaders, one who had weathered the stormy early years the best. B. J.'s life contrasted with the changes in fortune that befell Solon Langworthy. Despite the success of Modernized Chiropractic, the American School 191 collaboration proved to be as short-lived as those essayed by D. D. Palmer. As early as 1905, both Oakley Smith and Minora Paxson had moved to Chicago. Though she is remembered as the first woman to earn a chiropractic license, Paxson's later activities are unknown. Smith went on to abandon chiropractic entirely, to start a new practice which he called \"Naprapathy,\" or the \"connective tissue doctrine.\"2 Smith identified the \"ligatight\"\u2014an unnatural tightening of injured ligaments surrounding the vertebrae\u2014as a likely disruption of spinal functioning, and thereby the single cause of disease. With the loss of his associates and the discontinuation of Backbone, Langworthy lost momentum as a chiropractic innovator. He ceased writing, and it is uncertain whether he continued practicing as a chiropractor. His personal life seems to have taken a great toll on his professional productivity. One of Langworthy's daughters died in 1916. Her death provoked a crisis in what seems to have been an unhappy marriage. Langworthy's surviving daughter and his wife moved to the West coast, where they lived in California and Washington state. Ora May Langworthy filed for divorce in 1919, citing a long pattern of \"cruel and inhuman treatment and adultery.\" Solon Langworthy did remarry, a woman 26 years his junior, but in 1920 he suffered a medical event (possibly a stroke) that left him paralyzed. He died two years later, at the age of 54, and was buried in an unmarked grave in accordance with the strong wishes of his family.3 B. J. also benefited from the sidelining of Joy Loban. For a few years after its founding, Universal Chiropractic College threatened to become a major rival, but it was bedeviled by financial problems. The UCC was backed by stockholders who demanded returns on their investments. The situation came to a crisis in 1918, when the school merged with the Pittsburgh College of Chiropractic. Joseph Keating uncovered private communications to Tom Morris in the Palmer archives that reveal B. J.'s delight: \"The Universal School has closed their doors. Bankrupt. Goods are moved out. Gone! Dead! Buried, by gad, buried. I have said 'taps' over their remains. This is the end of a ten year fight. It has actually happened and come to pass.\"4 The fight proved unusually bitter, and continued even after Loban left for Pennsylvania to serve as a dean. In 1921 B. J. even published a fake obituary in the Fountain Head News. His altering of Loban's middle name (really \"Maxwell\") reveals a distasteful side to B. J.'s own character: OBITUARY During the week of Feb. 21st, there passed from the Chiropractic world Joy Manlove Loban 192 h i s t o r y r e p e at s President of the UCC The end came after a severe attack of talking sickness superimposed by an inflated ego.5 I bring this up this incident to demonstrate the extent of B. J.'s anger, and to raise a point that needs to be said at least once: however entertaining he was, B. J. could be a really mean guy. People who knew him remember B. J. for his temper, impulsiveness, and cruelty. Dave Palmer recalls his father viciously attacking trusted aides, and going upstairs to nap right after as if nothing had happened. In old age his behavior was sometimes quite bizarre, but even in the prime of life, B. J. flung his emotions and judgments around with enormous abandon. This needs to be borne in mind, for it illumines the steep arc of B. J.'s leadership and his precipitous fall from grace only a few years later. Loban did not actually die until 1936. A notice circulated in chiropractic periodicals citing an accident as the primary cause, and noting Loban's injuries were exacerbated by a vigorous chiropractic adjustment.6 His rout to Pittsburgh and the closure of UCC ended his challenge to B. J.'s leadership. While B. J. faced other rivals at the national level, such as John Howard at National School in Illinois, and Willard Carver at the Oklahoma school bearing his name, no new major rivals emerged in the state of Iowa. Freed from the pressure of his father and the ostentatious local affronts, B. J. set to work developing the PSC into a chiropractic \"empire.\" Whether B. J.'s governance was \"totalitarian\" is a matter of personal opinion, but it can certainly be described as \"totalistic\": until the mid-1920s, many operations critical to the profession\u2014education, associational and legal services, public relations, and the printing of chiropractic literature\u2014were based at the Palmer School. B. J.'s persona extended into every aspect of his environment. Scores of signs printed with his \"aphorisms\" lined the halls, reminding students that \"A winner never quits. A quitter never wins,\" and to \"Keep Smiling!\" He had an unshakable confidence that chiropractic was the superlative solution to a host of problems besetting humanity. Chiropractic truth promised to revolutionize health care, but B. J. also claimed it would solve the crises of religious alienation and spiritual ennui.7 A strong believer in modern advertising, B. J. developed a lecture called \"Salesmanship\" and presented it to business clubs across the country.8 He wrote a book for chiropractors, entitled Selling Yourself, which stressed the importance of self-promotion in a competitive business culture.9 B. J.'s detractors labeled him a fraud\u2014picking up on his idiosyncrasies and using them to tarnish the entire chiropractic profession. If it feels that B. J. took self-confidence to the level of \"confidence man,\" h i s t o r y r e p e at s 193 at least some of his bluster was in the spirit of the age. The sense of control this mindset offered made it attractive in the churning economy of the early twentieth century. B. J.'s promotional strategies affirmed the individuality of Americans beset by mass culture. His slogans celebrated the qualities of \"Distinctividuality,\" and \"Spizzerinctum\"; the latter term seems to correspond to old-fashioned \"spunk.\" What could be more individualist than creating a new, personal language and teaching it to others? There was a connection among B. J.'s views on chiropractic, success, and spirituality. Although health and healing were the preeminent expressions of spiritual \"advancement,\" financial prosperity was a consistent promise of the American Metaphysical tradition. Distinct from the \"Prosperity Gospel\" of American Christianity, Harmonial \"wealth theology\" was predicated on the belief that a person's thoughts are \"causative\" and can affect external reality. Today, millions of Americans are familiar with this idea through The Secret, in which author Rhonda Byrne draws upon William Atkinson's Thought Vibration and the Law of Attraction. Atkinson's work, however, was part of a larger genre of \"prosperity literature\" based on New Thought premises.10 This worldview saw changing one's self-perception as the first step to success in any venture, and changing the impressions of others as the second. \"Selling yourself\" became an essential component of the \"philosophy of achievement.\"11 B. J. contributed to this movement with his writings, motivational speeches, and chains of relationships. B. J. eagerly sought new technologies to help him promote chiropractic, starting with his use of \"lantern slides\"\u2014an early form of projection\u2014in his public talks. He also employed an \"electrical skeleton\" that lit up to explain how the \"human system is an electric dynamo.\"12 When voice recording became popular, the PSC added a \"phonographic department\" to record chiropractic lectures. B. J. even wrote a chiropractic play.13 Harking back to his days in vaudeville, he introduced \"Palmer Grams\": certificates that bearers could redeem for chiropractic treatment in towns across the nation. These were given to performers on the vaudeville circuit in the hope of inducing them to talk about chiropractic in their acts.14 \"I will sell Chiropractic, serve Chiropractic, and save Chiropractic if it will take me twenty lifetimes to do it. I will promote it within the law, without the law, in keeping with the law or against the law in order to get sick people well and keep the well from getting sick.\"15 In all things, B. J.'s public outreach was unencumbered by obeisance to propriety. The Palmer School even marketed a cigar named \"The Chiropractor.\" The picture on the box depicted B. J. in a loincloth, with a halo and herculean musculature\u2014standing on top of the 194 h i s t o r y r e p e at s \"Progress/Power over Death,\" ca. 1912. When B. J. Palmer marketed a \"chiropractic cigar\" to promote the new profession, he iconized himself on the cigar box cover. Archives, David D. Palmer Health Sciences Library/ Palmer College of Chiropractic. world, like a Titan or Greek hero. One wants to forgive B. J. for the excessiveness of the image. He knew many Americans still considered chiropractic a fringe practice, and was painfully aware that he lacked the kind of intellectual pedigree that made one \"respectable\" in the Progressive Era Midwest. B. J. Palmer's belief in \"supermen\" was a bulwark against anxieties about his social status. He believed that human history was substantially determined by \"great\" individuals, and that deliberate nonconformity was necessary to attain the independence of mind essential to human greatness.16 A religious freethinker, he aligned with skeptics he felt had made great but unappreciated contributions to humanity, citing Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Edison, Charles Darwin and Robert Ingersoll as examples.17 B. J. placed his father alongside them, by writing, \"D. D. Palmer was an uninhibited individualist. He lived a life that was an extreme in that respect. It takes an extremist to produce radical thots.\"18 h i s t o r y r e p e at s 195 B. J. presented his self-education as a valuable asset, deriding the \"college man\" stereotype and describing himself as a graduate of the school of \"hard knocks.\"19 He defended his own autodidacticism as a better route to knowledge. \"I have had but little schooling and if I had an opportunity to do it over again, give me the same road. By having no school finished viewpoints, I have been enabled to view broader than I would have done.\"20 He constructed a life story whose central narrative was his personal triumph over the abuse of others. By invoking the archetypes of the \"maverick,\" \"genius\" and \"Renaissance man,\" B. J. connected his biography to an ethos deeply ingrained in American culture. The behavioral model undergirding his flamboyance was advantageous to the chiropractic cause. Following B. J.'s lead, chiropractors learned to use a matrix of nineteenth-century cultural artifacts: earthy humor, populist anti-elitism, and Jacksonian individualism, to build a case for acceptance of the new profession. More importantly, B. J. made chiropractic protest fun. His greatest acts of leadership were in turning chiropractic's conflict with regular medicine into a spectator sport that Americans were moved to watch. As a result, into the 1950s B. J. Palmer was the best-known representative of chiropractic to small town America. a fragile empire In 1914, the Palmer School enrolled nearly 600 students. That year, B. J. also gained a strong ally in his efforts to organize chiropractors. Tom Morris began working full-time for the UCA, having failed to win the Wisconsin governorship in an election in which his Catholic faith was a handicap.21As chief legal counsel for the UCA, Morris won acquittals in most chiropractic prosecutions, and public sympathy in the few he lost.22 Consistent with the \"Go to Jail for Chiropractic\" strategies, patient demonstrations were held outside jails where chiropractors served their sentences.23 Voices across the profession praised the virtues of the \"martyrs\" to the \"cause\" of chiropractic. Meanwhile, the UCA learned to provide structural support for compliance with the no-fine policy by adding financial assistance to the families of chiropractors serving jail sentences as a service to its members. This caused membership in the UCA to increase substantially. At its peak, it held 5,000 members, onefourth of all registered chiropractors at the time.24 The scope of the \"Go to Jail for Chiropractic\" campaign is one index of the opposition faced by the profession. As early as 1908, the \"Department of Investigation\" of the American Medical Association began to monitor chiropractic as part of its larger effort to combat what it deemed \"quackery.\" 196 h i s t o r y r e p e at s In 1915, the Journal of the American Medical Association published an expose on the three schools then operating in Davenport: Palmer, UCC and the Davenport College of Chiropractic. Conducted in the spirit of Morris Fishbein's investigation of medical schools, \"Where Chiropractors are Made\" presented a woeful picture of the physical conditions in the institutions, and by implication the instruction therein.25 Even the Palmer School suffered sorely from a lack of equipment and resources: the flagship institution had four classrooms, few laboratory facilities, and no library. Human cadaver dissection, already the gold-standard for physicians' education, was beyond the reach of any of the Davenport colleges, though both the Palmer School and the UCC made an effort to provide a substitute in dissections of dogs. Self-serving as it could be, B. J.'s hoopla was a tonic to chiropractors' morale in this hostile social climate. The Palmer \"Lyceum\" grew to be a major annual event for Davenport and chiropractic America. For a week each August, several thousand chiropractors and their families crowded circus tents to hear presentations of chiropractic research. B. J. always took center stage, but the mood of the Chautauqua was recreated with public addresses by government officials, businessmen, and health reformers. Chiropractic \"martyrs\" gave testimonies about their imprisonment in a style that drew intentionally from Evangelicalism. The message resonated; between 1916 and 1921, ticket sales increased from 3,000 to 8,000.26 In 1916 enrollment at Palmer crashed, as World War I funneled many prospective chiropractors into the armed forces.27 For the next few years, the school made special efforts to recruit women by offering incentives for married couples to train together. The Palmer School attracted enough tuition-paying students to stay in operation through the war, after which soldiers matriculated in great numbers and the proportion of female students dropped off. The recruitment of women during this period points to the complicated position of women in chiropractic. In the early years of the Palmer Institute of Magnetic Cure, women made up a high percentage of students, as they had done at irregular medical schools throughout the nineteenth century. Palmer and other schools may have opened their doors to women less out of commitment to equality, however, than the bare need to fill classrooms. For several decades, the presence and status of women was not secure at the PSC or other chiropractic colleges. This was not due to deliberate exclusion; chiropractic magazines and college literature encouraged women to consider chiropractic as a career choice. Yet beyond essays championing \"Chiropractic for Women\" far greater attention was given over to male h i s t o r y r e p e at s 197 Lyceum Parade, ca. 1921. The Palmer Homecoming Lyceums became an annual event in Davenport. The sign for B. J. Palmer's radio station WOC can be seen across the street. Archives, David D. Palmer Health Sciences Library/Palmer College of Chiropractic. recruitment, especially in the postwar years, when veterans' tuition benefits for education and job training made male students a greater priority. In the 1920s, women were encouraged to study as \"chiropractic assistants,\" with the expectation that they would be the professional helpmeets of their husbands. After World War II, returning soldiers equipped with G.I. Bill tuition drove down the numbers of female students once more. Over time, the view that women were subordinate resulted in their dramatic under-representation in the profession. But women have not been invisible in chiropractic.28 They are very often remembered for their family roles, as \"matriarchs\" of chiropractic dynasties. Through most of the twentieth century, women chiropractors have carried a group voice in the profession with associations like the National Council of Women Chiropractors, an auxiliary of the NCA.29 In the pages of Chiropractic History and the publications of many chiropractic colleges and professional associations, there is substantial evidence that while gender expectations were those of small-town, white Protestant America, women were not held in disrespect. This does not get around the fact that women have remained a distinct minority in the profession. 198 h i s t o r y r e p e at s In the early 2000s, only one in five chiropractors practicing in the United States were women.30 chiropractic and dissenting science Despite the unequal participation of women in the chiropractic movement, there have been many important women leaders in the profession, starting with B. J.'s wife, Mabel Heath Palmer, who stands tall for her theoretical contributions. Most chiropractic historians regard Mabel as one of the individuals at the Palmer School best versed in orthodox medicine. She is said to have attended a regular medical school in Chicago, though this is unconfirmed.31 Mabel wrote an anatomy textbook for chiropractors that made arguments for a distinctly chiropractic understanding of human biology. After describing the pathways of the spinal nerves as understood in mainstream neurology, she wrote, \"Acceptance by most anatomists does not, by any means, prevent the Chiropractor from modifying the arrangement to conform to facts which may be proved by his nerve tracing and clinical observation.\"32 Mabel's research led her to posit several alternative theories to those of mainstream medicine, like her assertion that the optic nerves extended from the spinal cord.33 Such a configuration supported \"Direct Mental Impulse,\" the identification of the brain as the source of Innate, conveyed through the central nervous system. Her investigations were invaluable to B. J.'s project of reinterpreting human biology. Many of B. J.'s ideas were unusual and challenged accepted scientific knowledge. For example, B. J. explained that germs were harmless scavengers that fed on bodily wastes. Their proliferation in times of illness was the result of an increased food supply, in the form of internal toxins that resulted from subluxations.34 B. J. saw chiropractic as part of the longstanding vitalist tradition, in which levels, circulation, and quality of bodily vitality were the primary factors determining health. He compared Innate to other historical versions of the vital principle. \" 'Innate Intelligence' referred to above is a name Chiropractors give to the equivalent of what many know as Nature, vis medicatrix naturae, Universal Law, Universal Intelligence. As such, it lives in, flows through, and expresses itself in man.\"35 B. J. went so far as to seek to overturn the scientific method itself. In the pamphlet Induction vs. Deduction, he explained, chiropractic should be a \"deductive science,\" based on the recognition of first principles like the existence of Universal Intelligence. B. J. believed laboratory medicine had been corrupted by excessive observation-based empiricism; the \"deductive h i s t o r y r e p e at s 199 science\" he offered as a remedy used rationalist arguments to promote classic vitalism. \"Chiropractic, then, is based on deduction: if the body is sick, if there is a minus or excess quantity of function, permit life, Innate, to flow\u2014working from cause to effect.\"36 By this logic, B. J. attacked pathogenic theories of disease in favor of the idea that germs were scavengers. \"Did the microbe cause the dirt? . . . I reasoned, he was there for a good purpose and the more there the better off mankind was. The inductive reasoner says he causes the disease; the deductive reasoner says he keeps the alleyways of the lungs open by cleaning up the refuse, a janitor to the diseased organ.\"37 More important to the long-term future of chiropractic, deductive rationalism let B. J. connect Metaphysical forces to physical reality, explaining links between mind and body. \"In analyzing man, we found that he was mental and physical, spiritual and corporeal, immaterial plus material, and we could not deny that the two were together.\"38 This anti-scientific epistemology was prevalent in chiropractic.39 Chiropractors who disagreed with B. J. on many points still reinterpreted the natural sciences to find evidence of chiropractic truth.40 For example, the call for making chiropractic a \"deductive science\" was embraced by rivals like John Monroe, an instructor at the National School. Admittedly, Monroe sought to use the terms of B. J.'s argument against him; he rejected the Meric system as a reckless venture into an \"Empiricism\" that he felt was really the twisting of facts to support bad theory.41 His maneuver to control the terms of debate with B. J. resonates with chiropractors' attempts to redefine the rules of engagement with regular medicine. Chiropractic was qualitatively different and therefore needed to be understood by its own standards; the Metaphysical emphasis allowed certain medical questions to be bypassed entirely. Chiropractors' reconfigurations of science were significant beyond their functional utility. The individualist epistemology that was central to B. J.'s character and the chiropractic profession coursed like a vital current through American culture. Chiropractors' promotions of a rationalist, metaphysically based science were appealing in a climate of uncertainty about the meaning of science and religion.42 The distinct understanding of science affected both the curriculum and pedagogy at the Palmer School. The introduction of laboratory sciences was slowed not only by their cost, but also by skepticism about their necessity. The Palmer School did amass one of the largest bone collections in the nation; in \"Where Chiropractors are Made\" and other evaluations of its resources, critics noted the osteology collection as one area of strength amid otherwise impoverished teaching facilities. Students were educated mostly through 200 h i s t o r y r e p e at s lectures and the memorization of B. J.'s ideas. Starting as early as 1909, students at Palmer were first encouraged and then expected to write a senior thesis as a requirement for graduation. Individual topics varied, but the papers were consistent in content and style. To a startling degree, the essays relate the same points, in the same sequence, and often with nearly identical wording. More than a few included passages praising the chiropractic \"developer.\" Thus could Lotta Bertram end her essay with the accolade, \"Should not this science, which is tried and true, have a leading place in saving the lives of men? And should not its developer, B. J. Palmer, a man of sterling worth and undaunted energy, have a place in the hearts of all men, and be heralded as one of the great benefactors of the age?\"43 the roaring twenties The years after World War I witnessed several key changes in the Palmer empire. In 1916 B. J. introduced a new chiropractic theory, known as \"Majors and Minors,\" which divided bodily symptoms into primary and secondary ailments.44 A person could only suffer from one major condition, which was caused by a \"major subluxation,\" but also could have multiple \"minor subluxations\" that caused multiple other conditions. B. J. presented Majors and Minors as a refinement of Meric theory, but this \"improvement\" implied the incorrectness and imminent obsolescence of most chiropractors. Over his long career B. J. used this tactic several times against the rest of his profession. The revision became deeply divisive. Willard Carver, an erstwhile ally of the Palmers, published an open disagreement in the form of a pamphlet called Major Work a Fallacy. Carver not only took issue with the science of the Majors and Minors system, but asserted the right to criticize B. J., who he felt had abused his chiropractic authority. Other protests were at this point mostly held in check, but reactions again foreshadowed future disagreements. By 1919, enrollment at the Palmer School had more than recovered, surpassing 1,200 students that year and climbing to 1,538 in 1920. In 1921, the Palmer School and Infirmary of Chiropractic was renamed the Palmer School of Chiropractic. That year, discharged soldiers increased the student body to 2,776, a number that lends support to B. J.'s claim to be running the largest vocational program in America at the time.45 Prospects for the Palmer School had never seemed so bright. The chiropractic historian A. E. Dye describes the period between 1910 and 1920 as one of relative peace in the chiropractic world, with few internal controversies.46 Things unraveled in the early 1920s, suggesting that the previous h i s t o r y r e p e at s 201 decade was actually a time of muted cooperation between Straights and Mixers in achieving the goal of legal recognition. Kansas and Michigan passed chiropractic laws in 1913. These states were followed two years later by North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, and Wisconsin. By 1927, thirty-five states legally recognized the practice.47 The details of specific legislation often led to disagreement among chiropractors. Virtually all chiropractors at least passively supported the basic legality of chiropractic, as manifest in their right to practice free from harassment. In the increasingly litigious climate of the early twentieth century, some chiropractors sought this right, but licensure entailed accepting external regulations of quality control, and it restricted practice to the credentialed. B. J. always wanted chiropractic to be legal, but he preferred a free-market approach and resisted the certifying that risked preferring a particular version of chiropractic.48 B. J. foresaw the costs of abstaining from debates about the legal future of the profession, which was likely to become widely legalized throughout the United States. He came around to supporting licensure but in a way that augmented the influence of Straight chiropractic in the debate about legislation. An important component of this effort was a purging of Mixers in 1919 from the United Chiropractors' Association. Mixer chiropractors would no longer be allowed membership in the UCA, nor would the organization represent them at trial. Furthermore, the UCA would no longer work with state chiropractic organizations that admitted Mixers to their ranks. B. J. described the new policies as \"cleaning the house.\"49 He hoped they would discourage chiropractors from taking the Mixer route. Instead, the policies prompted the founding of a rival association. The American Chiropractic Association was chartered in 1922, to circumvent the requirements of the UCA. The alignment of the ACA with the National School of Chiropractic made it, too, a partisan organization. The \"golden age\" of harmony was over. The fallout from this schism took a few years to manifest. Until then, revenues from increased tuition gave unprecedented rein to B. J.'s creativity. In 1923, he found a cutting-edge means of promoting chiropractic when he began operating an AM radio station, WOC. B. J.'s teenage son Dave was interested in ham radio. He inspired B. J. to buy a 100-watt set, which was installed in a building on campus.50 The call letters for the new station were assigned by the radio commission, but B. J. alternately claimed they stood for \"World of Chiropractic\" or \"Wonders of Chiropractic.\" When WOC went on the air in March 1921, the Federal Radio Commission prohibited commercial advertising. The regulation presented no obstacle, however, to B. J.'s broadcasting of 202 h i s t o r y r e p e at s \"educational lectures\" on chiropractic.51 Radio gave B. J. Palmer the chance to send the chiropractic message across unprecedented distances. In 1924 he invested more than fifty thousand dollars to upgrade the station to 50,000 watts. WOC was one of the first thirty stations broadcasting news and entertainment; at the time, the uncluttered AM bandwidth allowed its signal to be picked up across impressive distances, from California to Maine, and from Alaska down to the Panama Canal. The WOC signal is even said to have been detected in Hawaii, Samoa, and the Philippines. B. J.'s familiarity with vaudeville was an asset to WOC. The station's programming was folksy and entertaining, with a variety of music styles. Its \"Americana\" format was a major reason for the station's success. B. J. spoke personally to his audience, in a manner not unlike the \"Fireside Chats\" of F. D. R. Through radio, he embedded chiropractic into an imagined A merican authenticity that was highly attractive in a society increasingly dependent on technology\u2014including the one that brought his messages into American homes. B. J. sometimes attended the Second Methodist Church in Rock Island, Illinois, but Christianity was not an intellectual priority for him. Hardly evangelical, he nevertheless was an avid evangelist, using the media in ways similar to Fundamentalist radio pioneers.52 But while B. J. saw his empire advance through mass communication, a vital part of the Palmer enterprise already was in retreat. Enrollment at the Palmer School began to fall once more, as gains from the war's end tapered off. In 1922, the same year B. J. bought WOC, 1,509 students registered. What first may have seemed a \"return to normalcy\" in the form of smaller class size soon portended the start of an alarming trend. In 1923 enrollment had fallen further, to 1,000 students.53 The Palmer School could no longer assume it would be students' first choice for chiropractic training. Rather, in the early 1920s the school found itself in ever fiercer competition with other chiropractic colleges. B. J. regarded chiropractic as a family trade secret that entitled him to a good portion of its profits. Furthermore, the Palmers' lifestyle demanded increasing amounts of money to pay for travel, cars, and art collections. These personal exigencies may have caused B. J. to misuse funds from the UCA, though this cannot be proven.54 In 1922 or 1923, he suffered a nervous breakdown and spent a number of months in a sanitarium in Pass Christian, Mississippi.55 The incident was suppressed in the 1920s; even B. J.'s enemies do not seem to have publicly discussed it. In later years, B. J. credited his recovery to collecting rocks on the banks of the Wolf River. He brought his collection with him when he returned to Davenport in 1923, seemingly h i s t o r y r e p e at s 203 Little Bit O'Heaven. B. J.

The stones gathered in his despair became the literal foundation of one of his most creative projects, the elaborate garden of the Palmer Mansion. B. J. began to build the Palmer Mansion garden into a local tourist attraction that opened in 1924. The petrified wood, geodes, and shell-encrusted benches made for interesting landscaping, but most visitors to \"Little Bit O'Heaven\" were probably more taken by the giant tortoise roaming the courtyard. B. J.'s spiritual eclecticism was manifest in the array of religious objects in the garden: Alaskan totem poles stood yards away from eight grimacing Southeast Asian idols, several statues of the Buddha, and a small Christian chapel, only eight feet square. No one should be surprised so many of the attractions were religious in nature. Little Bit O'Heaven was full of curiosities\u2014physical signs of a Metaphysical world in which \"all things are possible.\" B. J. did not just seek to 204 h i s t o r y r e p e at s represent opulent material success, but an abundance of ideas. Yet his \"abundance\" was a material expression of the chaos of his thoughts, as well as his optimism and creativity.56 Perhaps the most Barnum-like touch in B. J.'s garden was the grotto of live alligators. Anecdotes often exaggerate with time, but this legend is rooted in truth. B. J. bought several dozen baby alligators from Florida. How many survived is unknown, but quite a few grew to a respectable size of at least six feet long. As they did, their upkeep became unmanageable, especially when they were brought into the basement of Palmer Mansion for the winter. B. J.'s son Dave was expected to feed and care for all the family pets. Later in life, in a remarkably understated account, he told how it became impossible to clean the concrete holding bin.57 In fact, Dave resorted to throwing meat into the pit and quickly retreating upstairs, but the smell followed him. When it drifted through the rest of the house and ruined a dinner party, Mabel Palmer demanded the alligators' removal. B. J. searched unsuccessfully for a zoo to take them. Eventually they went to the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago, on the condition that B. J. underwrite the construction of a new reptile house. B. J. charged admission to Little Bit O'Heaven, but this did not bring in enough money to cover the garden's embellishments or pay for B. J.'s other eccentric interests. The prospect of personal financial gain clearly influenced B. J.'s introduction of an invention that he predicted would revolutionize the chiropractic profession. the neurocalometer Through the twentieth century, chiropractors were some of the leading proponents of healing gadgets that detractors would identify as \"device quackery.\"58 The \"instruments\" of physicians and the \"devices\" of alternative practitioners served the same purpose, making tangible connections to abstract scientific ideas even professionals understood poorly and approached, one could say, on nearly supernatural terms. People wanted physical objects that could mediate ideas about \"imponderable\" forces. Leveraging popular conceptions about what it meant to be \"scientific,\" the \"Neurocalometer\" served as a sophisticated technology for chiropractors trained in its operation. In this way it was both mystifying and mediating\u2014and it increased the distance between patient and practitioner. The Neurocalometer was invented by Dossa Dixon Evins, a Palmer graduate with an engineering background.59 The device was premised on the belief that subluxations\u2014the misalignments of vertebrae that caused disruptions of h i s t o r y r e p e at s 205 the nervous system\u2014could be identified by differences in temperature. Sites of injury or illness were said to be slightly warmer than surrounding tissues. The Neurocalometer allegedly identified these sites with more accuracy than human examination.60 The Neurocalometer was the material expression of several suppositions animating the chiropractic world. The invention contributed to chiropractors' emulation of scientific medicine by offering empirical proof of subluxations and thereby confirming vertebral-vitalist chiropractic theory. The Neurocalometer also materially rendered chiropractic as science, and fed popular demands for healing technologies. B. J. appears to have initially scorned Evins when the younger chiropractor showed him the device. Given B. J.'s love of inventions, it is not clear why he was hostile. His reaction may have been based in a wariness of \"medical devices,\" which he associated with Mixers. Medical devices also often provoked investigations of medical fraud, making them risky investments despite their lucrative potential. Frank Elliott encouraged B. J. to give the prototype a second look. He knew the Palmer School already had begun marketing one piece of chiropractic equipment: the \"Hi-Lo\" adjusting table.61 Elliott helped draw up an agreement for the manufacture and marketing of the Neurocalometer that would give most of the profits to B. J. B. J. unveiled the Neurocalometer in 1923 and promoted it heavily at the 1924 Homecoming Lyceum. In a plenary speech entitled \"The Hour Has Struck,\" he made acceptance of the device a test of allegiance for the profession. The audience quickly perceived that much about the invention was controversial. The Neurocalometer was only available on a rental basis. The contract system resembled those used to market other questionable health gadgets; it bore a particular similarity to the \"Oscilloclast\" marketed by the notorious quack Albert Abrams, creator of \"Radionics.\" In \"The Hour Has Struck,\" B. J. excoriated the profession for its ingratitude and defended his right to profit from chiropractic. He raised the rental fee from $750 to $2,200 for a ten-year contract, and promised to increase it again after the Lyceum, to $3,000. This price increase alarmed many in the audience, for the new amount was commensurate with the cost of an average house in the 1920s.62 In the short term, B. J.'s heavy-handed tactic was successful. The desire to avoid the upcoming escalation led nearly 1,000 chiropractors to sign contracts at the Lyceum. Many colleagues, however, both nationally and at Palmer College, had concerns that the main purpose of the invention was to make B. J. rich. No one knows exactly how much money B. J. took in that first year, but it was very plausibly more than $1.5 million.63 B. J. made the Neurocalometer a 206 h i s t o r y r e p e at s Promoted by B. J. Palmer in the early 1920s, the Neurocalometer caused divisions in the chiropractic world because of its cost and resemblance to other patented medical devices. Archives, David D.

J. hoped through the contracts to finally conquer the profession, they had the opposite effect. As the machine drained money and morale from the struggling profession, frustrations translated into a massive loss of confidence in B. J.'s leadership. The Neurocalometer affected Palmer College, too. In 1925, four key instructors announced their resignations: James Firth, Harry Edwin Vedder, Steven J. Burich, and Arthur G. Hendricks. Already frustrated with the doctrinal orthodoxy surrounding the diagnostic system of Majors and Minors, their collective disillusionment regarding the Neurocalometer precipitated their departure. The following year, the \"Big Four\" chartered Lincoln College of Chiropractic in Indianapolis. Lincoln College operated for several decades in Indiana and later merged with the National College of Chiropractic.65 The schism evoked Loban's break of over a decade earlier, but with greater consequences to professional unity, as the sympathies of chiropractors around the country went to Indiana with Firth, Hendricks, Burich, and Vedder. The most devastating consequence of the Neurocalometer was the loss of the personal and professional support of one of B. J.'s most valued colleagues. At the 1925 annual meeting of the UCA, Tom Morris resigned from his post as legal counsel.66 B. J. promptly tendered his own resignation as secretary, at which point Morris accepted reinstatement. It was the first time B. J. backed down in this kind of power struggle. After quitting the UCA, B. J. attempted to create a viable alternative to the organization by joining New York chiropractor William Werner in the creation of the Chiropractic Health Bureau (CHB). Newly freed from B. J.'s domination, the UCA was still wounded. Chiropractors were shifting their allegiances to the American Chiropractic Association. The ACA absorbed the UCA in 1930, and from then on was the dominant professional organization. The merger also brought a name change, to the National Chiropractic Association. In 1963, another reorganization restored the name American Chiropractic Association, by which it still is known. Today the ACA continues as the larger of two prominent national chiropractic associations. The other one is the International Chiropractors Association, which formed out of the Chiropractic Health Bureau in 1942.67 Twentieth-century chiropractic would expand beyond the Palmer dynasty, though B. J. and the Palmer School remained central. In the 1920s chiropractic history diverged into two separate but related narratives, partly characterized by the Straight-Mixer divide, but equally defined by the tension between B. J.'s activities as a dominant, vocal chiropractic proponent and the rank and 208 h i s t o r y r e p e at s file of the profession. As long as the system was controlled by the Palmers, the profession could be, and was, understood in the \"long shadow of the man.\" Being cut off from the profession he'd worked so hard to build wounded B. J. He sought rejuvenation in a steamship voyage to Asia with Mabel and Dave. B. J. kept in touch with his American fans through reports he sent to Frank Elliott in Davenport, which were read on the air and later compiled into a book, 'Round the World with B.J., published in 1926. The Palmers returned late in 1925 with stories, statues, and artifacts. B. J. had started to grow his many strange collections, including the bladed weapons and \"phallic art\" that were among the largest in the world. The collections were sold off after his death, but in his life they added to a notoriety that he welcomed: Wherever we have gone, we have tried to seek, see, and study any and all such, because we wanted to know their viewpoint. We have purchased photos, carvings, idols, in any and all forms, we have an historical, architectural collection well worth seeing and studying. Some day we propose putting it within reach, that others may study, who want to grow and understand more than that which closely surrounds them, who want to push their horizons farther beyond the borders of their own family, home, or village. It consists of pieces from Tibet, China, Japan, Hawaii, France, Egypt, Rome, Alaska, India, Pompeii, Fiji, etc. After all, is there anything wrong in the worship of that which is natural in nature, from which we all spring and have our being? What is wrong in its study or putting its religious symbols on exhibition, that others may study it also? Some day we shall arrange our collection that it may be seen. We anticipate that we shall be criticized, for we know it is hard for an average circumscribed occidental mind to understand the philosophies, religions, and customs of other nations and races, past and present.68 Though his interest in pornography crossed the lines of respectability, B. J. saw himself as making a serious effort to uncover and preserve world religion. The venture would have the concurrent effect of establishing B. J. as a connoisseur. \"We have, amongst our phallic pieces, a carved ivory snuff box which was dug out of the ruins of ancient Pompeii. That makes this symbol approximately 2,000 years old. It is much like a bi-valve double-shell oyster shell, convex on the outside, concave inside. Between the two outside shells, inside, is a straight partition of ivory that divides the two halves. On one side of one shell are the carved figures of the male; the other is the h i s t o r y r e p e at s 209 female. To say the least, from the carving point of new, they are masters of art. The partition piece of ivory represents a male and female in coitus carved in a bas-relief effect. This piece was more than likely carried by some prominent business man or in the toga of some rich or wealthy Roman to carry his snuff or whatever else he used in those days.\"69 Based upon his description, it is improbable that B. J.'s snuffbox was \"authentic,\" but the passage is revealing of his character. Class status held deep meaning for B. J., and he read his own class assumptions into world history, imagining the Roman Empire in terms of the commercial economy and middle-class society he understood. His assigning \"Pompeii\" as the origin of the object is meaningful too, because in popular literature about \"sex worship,\" Priapus was identified as the patron god of Pompeii, making that doomed city a dedicated site for Phallicism.70 This raises an uncomfortable point: much of B. J.'s writing on these topics is pilfered from other sources. The essay containing the above passages, published in 1949 in The Bigness of the Fellow Within but likely drafted years earlier, is mostly taken from two older pieces that B. J. did not credit: Eliza Burt Gamble's 1897 book, The God-Idea of the Ancients, and an essay by Lee Alexander Stone, a physician from Chicago, that ran in 1920 in The Urologic and Cutaneous Review.71 The authorial liberties B. J. took in his essay on phallic worship characterize much of his writing. If this diminishes his character, it also makes his motives deeper and more complicated by presenting a brutal reminder of the opportunism running through all his projects. In his defense, B. J. had not done much out of the ordinary; copying and reprinting sources under one's own name was so common as to be constitutive of populist intellectual writing. From one perspective, B. J. was really only culpable of omitting the names of authors he genuinely admired. On the other hand, it was also common for people to reprint entire books by other writers and represent them as their own, in clear cases of commercial theft. I do not believe B. J. intended to profit in the same way that the \"physician\" J. Henry Warner appears to have done when he reprinted Dr. William Earl's \"health guide\" The Illustrated Silent Friend as a book he entitled The Magic Monitor and Medical Intelligencer.72 Remarkably self-serving in his perceptions, B. J.'s thinking shows such strong departures from conventional reality that he seems to exemplify the traits of the \"fantasy-prone personality\" described by psychologists Sheryl Wilson and Theodore Barber.73 I am able to believe he \"lied with complete sincerity\"\u2014eliding the issue of authorship, even while fiercely protecting his own ideas and writing when they were appropriated by other writers. 210 h i s t o r y r e p e at s Comprehending B. J.'s plagiarism may help solve the riddle posed in Lars B. Lindholm's observation that \"occultists of all times have been notorious for unscrupulously pilfering from each other with no regards to copyright.\"74 The conflicts over authorship in Spiritualism, Theosophy, Christian Science, and Rosicrucianism lead one to suspect there may be something intrinsic to the Metaphysical tradition that fosters this propensity. Why do Metaphysicians plagiarize each other so regularly? What in this strand of spirituality leads its proponents to succumb to what Andrew Potter has called a \"vice of authenticity\"?75 I believe at least part of the answer lies in the way autodidacticism put few constraints on writers, and the prominence of this intellectual style in Metaphysical religion. c o m b at i n g m e d i c a l t y r a n n y With B. J. no longer their default authority, chiropractors felt new confidence to express their voice, and there was need and opportunity for them to do so. Much of this story concerns the evolution of a social infrastructure: organizations and associations that would represent chiropractic interests. The victories won by chiropractic would involve many stakeholders with different strategies and priorities. B. J. retained a core of loyal supporters, and had the resources to be a vocal presence within and beyond the profession. His work ethic and possession of an in-house printing press made possible B. J.'s continuation as a chiropractic gadfly. As a leader in the Straight movement, he modeled dual stances of cooperation with Mixers and separatism. The emergence of two chiropractic factions happened at an inopportune moment. Social movements are less often regarded as threatening when very small. Rather, hostilities seem to increase as small groups grow, and often announce hopes for social inclusion. Similarly for chiropractic, expansion drew negative attention. Exposes of \"quackery\" already were favored topics of muckraking journalists like George Creel, who in 1915 penned a series for Harper's Weekly on three chiropractic colleges in Chicago.76 In 1923 a popular New York theater critic named Nellie Revell included her visit to a chiropractor in Right off the Chest, her account of a series of failed treatments for a back problem. While Revell held no resentment against the chiropractor who treated her, she accused him of crushing three of her vertebrae, leaving readers with the strong impression he had made her an invalid for life.77 The intensification in the 1920s of the American Medical Association's campaign against chiropractic shows how chiropractors' battle for legitimacy was not only legal, but also cultural. At the head of this charge was h i s t o r y r e p e at s 211 Morris Fishbein, the editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association. In 1925 Fishbein published a damning excoriation of popular healing, The Medical Follies: An Analysis of the Foibles of Some Healing Cults, Including Osteopathy, Homeopathy, Chiropractic, and the Electronic Reactions of Abrams.78 The book brought the stance of organized medicine to the general public. Chiropractors watched the campaign against them grow more orchestrated and forceful. As essential as they were for legal protection, courts and ballots alone could not deliver social legitimacy or financial success, which depended strongly on chiropractors' standing in American culture. The historian Robert Laurence Moore identified a pattern among religious subcultures relevant to the chiropractic movement.79 Comparing American Catholics, evangelical Protestants, and Latter-day Saints, Moore acknowledged the simultaneous reality of both their discrimination as cultural minorities, and their use of a cultivated sense of persecution for group solidarity. Furthermore, Moore's case studies all adapted the \"establishment\" model: appropriating the rhetoric, symbols, behavior, and cultural forms associated with American nationalism, so as to become \"model Americans.\" Into the present, however, each group has both confronted and maintained some ambiguity with mainstream culture, complicating their understanding of what it means to be \"American.\" Health movements are amenable to this interpretive frame as well; despite its association with the American counterculture, there is a historical tie between alternative medicine and American nationalism. The intersection of health protest with populist nationalism has been noticed by many historians, including Ronald Numbers and Nathan Hatch.80 From the time of Andrew Jackson, health reformers have framed therapeutic choice as a matter of civil liberty. N. C. Ross, a chiropractor from Fort Wayne, Indiana, took up the call: \"The practitioners of the different systems should have entire freedom of opportunity to present their work and ideals, BUT IT SHOULD BE LEFT TO THE PEOPLE TO DECIDE UPON THEIR MERITS. This means also that no method of practice must have the influence or power, either by legislative or other means, to deny the sick the inalienable right to select the physician of their choice.\"81 Chiropractors grew skilled at taking the message of \"medical freedom\" directly to the American people. Restraints on chiropractic, such as chiropractors' inability to get admitting privileges at hospitals or the AMA's policy forbidding member physicians from making referrals to chiropractors, were reconfigured as injustices against patients. A passionate example can be found in a pamphlet supporting the inclusion of 212 h i s t o r y r e p e at s chiropractic in military veterans' healthcare benefits. Leo L. Spears, a member of the \"Disabled Veterans of the World War,\" railed against medical \"tyranny\": Our country is the greatest in the world because of the freedom it offers to individuals in matters of religion and politics; because of its guarantee to one and all of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; life as one chooses to live it so long as he does not infringe upon the rights of others; liberty of choice in all things; and open road to happiness. Our statute books are filled with laws prohibiting combines or other methods of restrictions to individuals. And yet there is no greater combine in the world today than that of the medical profession, which is being protected by its strong and forceful denial, annulment and exclusion of the rights of the very boys who so valiantly sacrificed their all to retain to this country the very privileges of FREEDOM OF CHOICE which are being denied them. Thousands upon thousands of us are suffering and dying because our government, in giving the medical combine exclusive authority in all things medical, is aiding it in its autocratic rule and its cold refusal to grant us, at government expense, the liberty of choosing our own methods of healing. We do not all believe in medicine any more than we are all of one religion or one political party. Yet, political medicine would force us to imbibe it whether we like it or not and whether it cures or kills us. And it is the deplorable fact that every man in this country who sustained wounds or contracted disease while defending our liberties, is being forced to take medicine or nothing if he would have treatment at the expense of our government.82 Spears spoke not only to the recent carnage of WWI, but the bloody sacrifices of the American Revolution. Like other medical sectarians and American populists more generally, chiropractors cultivated a \"Jacksonian\" understanding of democracy that was strongly antiauthoritarian. The American Revolution is particularly attractive to populists, for whom it symbolizes both the establishment and destruction of the social order. Like other populist movements, chiropractors learned to engage in a distinct type of \"edgework,\" creating self-understandings and public representations that transgressed the boundary between establishment and mainstream. Chiropractors learned to navigate sets of opposing tensions that were acutely felt in American culture. h i s t o r y r e p e at s 213 chiropractic on main street Nationalizing chiropractic meant taking control of its representation. The foremost task was presenting the system to an American populace still largely unfamiliar with it. It also entailed demonstrating the practice to be based in modern understandings of human biology, reconfiguring popular perceptions of chiropractors, and convincing Americans that spinal problems were a health concern. Chiropractic organizations, including both the ACA and the Chiropractic Health Bureau, constructed an identity for the profession that drew on two opposing philosophical orientations. Chiropractic was understood as rational and scientific, and yet romantic and harmoniously \"in tune\" with nature. In close proximity to regular medicine, but qualitatively separate from it, chiropractic was a modern holistic alternative. Maintaining scientific plausibility demanded a consistency of message from both factions. It was helpful that Straights and Mixers agreed about the big picture. Neurocentric physiology supported both forms of chiropractic theory. Beneath a shower of technical vocabulary, the vertebral vitalist paradigm was preserved and upheld. This can be hard to detect, as an example from the 1950s shows: \"Chiropractic is founded on the theory that one or several segments of the spinal column may become slightly displaced, or subluxated, as a result of abnormal contractions of the muscular and tendinous structures, which bind and hold the segments of the column together (these abnormal contractions being produced by trauma or reflex irritation from the visceral or somatic regions of the body) and that this slight displacement, or subluxation, tends to narrow the lumen of the intervertebral foramen, causing encroachment upon the structures (nerves, blood vessels and lymphatics) within, and a consequent disturbance of their function. This disturbance impairs the blood and lymph supply to the nerve, thereby depriving it of nutriment, and disturbing to a more or less extent, the conduction of the impulses or messages along its fibers.\"83 Chiropractors brought distinctly modern terminology to the nineteenth-century conception of \"nutritive\" vertebral vitalism. Disease came to be described in terms of \"functional illness,\" held to be a result of \"neurological complications.\" Nerve \"energy\" or \"force\" was understood as an element that \"fed\" the rest of the body, both at the cellular level and by affecting the \"function\" of organs. By \"impinging\" nerves, spinal subluxations blocked the free flow of this energy. This caused local pain, as well as \"innervation\" that starved transmitting nerves and deprived organs of the factor critical to healthy physiology. In this way, many types of 214 h i s t o r y r e p e at s illness were reframed as \"neurological complications\" for which chiropractic treatment could be helpful. Chiropractors' projects of cultural redefinition were animated by paradox. Their dual invocation of elite and populist identity can be detected in their patient literature, in which the language alternates between obscure medical terminology and straightforward \"layman's terms.\" Most likely it was B. J. who first compared a spinal subluxation to a blocked water hose, but cartoons of fire hydrants and garden hoses grew pervasive. Many pamphlets only made vague appeals to the \"natural healing force\" in the body, assured general \"wellness,\" or promised the ability to cultivate \"resistance\" to disease. And while chiropractors viewed their practice as a comprehensive treatment system, they traded on popular conceptions of chiropractors as \"spine specialists.\" The profession encouraged members to perform community outreach by screening for scoliosis and other back problems in public schools. They highlighted the role of spinal conditions in full body health. Advertising campaigns and patient literature disseminated information about back pain, scoliosis, and other spinal conditions. A brochure from 1942 offers a good example in its warning about the pernicious consequences of bad posture: \"The mechanically abnormal or distorted body. . . is characterized by poor posture. . . . The patient invariably has poor health. It does matter what name you give his or her ailment, whether it be chronic headache, liver trouble, stomach trouble, bronchitis, arthritis, piles, fallen arches, varicose veins, appendicitis, heart trouble, or any other ailment you may think of. This postural and mechanical distortion is the cause.\"84 While chiropractic was rent by internal divisions, Straights and Mixers did not publicly air their disagreements about chiropractic theory. One could take a no-holds-barred approach within the chiropractic world, and chiropractic publications and internal documents both show this. Literature meant for the outside, like patient information, however, shows a very different approach, and was usually cheerfully bland. There were significant absences in Straight publications. Even much of the patient literature B. J. himself wrote was vague about Chiropractic Philosophy. Chiropractors hoped to create a positive public image by invoking conceptions of healing practitioners that medical doctors themselves had created. Through patient literature, advertising, and public relations outreach, the \"family doctor\" was represented as wise, powerful, and benevolent\u2014 qualities that in American culture are frequently associated with God. At the same time, the imagined placement of his small office on an idealized \"Main h i s t o r y r e p e at s 215 Street\" conferred an accessibility that was deeply human. This archetype triggered sentiments that resonated strongly in American culture even after the First World War. The divinely bestowed \"gift of healing,\" balanced alongside an advanced scientific judgment, made this figure a symbol for the soothing of turmoil over science and religion. The American Medical Association worked hard to convince Americans that individual physicians resembled this archetype, and just as energetically to disassociate chiropractors from the ideal. The chiropractic profession responded by creating for its practitioners an idealized \"family chiropractor.\" In the competition for control over this symbology, chiropractors held an advantage in their appeals to agrarian nostalgia and \"small-town\" America. The perception that chiropractic was less scientific made its practitioners seem more like \"regular\" people. Even so, chiropractors went to elaborate lengths to emulate the cultural forms of regular medicine. While many people might connect \"veterinary chiropractic\" to jokes on late night television, in fact it was developed as one of many subspecialties. Chiropractic approaches to mental health, pediatrics, and obstetrics and gynecology were taught at many schools and marketed to the public, but only in Oregon did chiropractors obtain the right as care providers to deliver babies. Framing the practice as a \"natural\" health option helped guide chiropractors through important structural decisions, such as developing a position on the use of prescription medication, which Straights and Mixers both agreed to shun. This was an intelligent, preemptive retreat from a battle the profession was likely to have lost. Physicians had spread the fear of public harm from dangerous drugs falling into the hands of incompetent quacks. Going \"drugless\" quelled those anxieties, and eliminated one major argument against legalization. Because pharmaceuticals were a matter of social power, however, some chiropractors hoped to obtain the right to prescribe medications. This is one example of how public commonality masked internal division. The sentiment grew over time, with as much as one-third of the profession supporting prescription rights by the early 1960s.85 c u lt u r a l o u t s i d e r s Highlighting or downplaying the medical and holistic dimensions of the practice allowed chiropractors to present the system as either an elective companion to medicine or a legitimate challenger to it. By offering images and positions that reconciled opposing categories and soothed Americans' cultural anxieties, chiropractors truly did offer a means to cure \"dis-ease.\" 216 h i s t o r y r e p e at s Their edgework earned the profession grudging acknowledgment, first culturally and ultimately legally. But chiropractic victories must be read with some critical riding clauses. The first is that licensure did not obtain security for the profession. Through the 1920s, chiropractors grew in number and gained legal recognition in most states, but they found a new obstacle quickly put in place.86 Whether out of concern for vulnerable patients or a desire to maintain good \"market share\" in the field of healthcare, medical doctors encouraged state licensing boards to require chiropractors to pass the same basic science examinations as regular physicians. Physicians' groups launched state initiatives for \"basic science\" laws, which established boards of examiners to test graduates of all health-related professional programs in the core subjects of biomedicine.87 Their argument was that practitioners of all \"healing arts\" (regular and eclectic medicine, homeopathy, naturopathy, chiropractic, and osteopathy) should demonstrate \"competent\" understanding of the \"basic\" health sciences through day-long written examinations. The first such law was passed in Wisconsin in 1925, the Morikubo victory evidently long forgotten. Their success in restricting alternative practitioners made the laws popular, spreading to half the states before being repealed in the 1970s. The content of the tests varied by state, but they usually featured anatomy, physiology, and pathology, and often bacteriology, biochemistry, and public health. The independence of the state boards was meant to keep them free from pressure by the professions they regulated, but basic-science laws were extremely effective in limiting nonphysicians from practicing. The laws drove nails into the coffin of the eclectic movement, and in a compilation survey of the exams from seven states, nearly three-quarters of the chiropractors tested did not pass.88 In 1935 the National Chiropractic Association created a Committee on Educational Standards, with the goal of converting the profession away from proprietary training. The committee pushed for the closing or merger of struggling chiropractic schools, upgrading the curricula of the surviving colleges, and adaptation to basic-science requirements. Its expectation was that schools would adopt not-for-profit status and governance by independent boards. This led to B. J. naming John Nugent, leader of the educational standards committee, \"Chiropractic's Anti-Christ.\"89 But Nugent showed prescience in anticipating future challenges from naturopathy, only a minor rival at the time. Naturopathy and chiropractic grew apart in the 1930s and 1940s, as the American Chiropractic Association took steps to put distance between the professions.90 In 1954 Nugent persuaded the ACA to refuse certification of any chiropractic schools offering naturopathic degrees.91 h i s t o r y r e p e at s 217 Chiropractic colleges faced great pressure to adjust their curricula. By the 1940s, many schools taught human anatomy with cadaver dissection. Chiropractic colleges also were increasingly chartered or reorganized as nonprofit institutions, expected to be more open with their finances, and governed by boards of trustees. Cleveland Chiropractic College and Lincoln College of Chiropractic were among the first schools to adopt the nonprofit model, in 1924 and 1926, respectively. The other major schools followed suit over the next two decades, and today, nonprofit status is required for certification by the main accrediting body, the Council on Chiropractic Education (CCE).92 The chiropractic profession adapted, but the more rigorous standards forced the closing of many chiropractic colleges that could not meet the new requirements.93 After 1945, however, many chiropractic colleges benefited from the tuition provided to discharged soldiers through the G.I. Bill. In fact, this revenue may have saved the profession. The surviving schools were disproportionately Mixer in orientation. Chiropractors' adoption of new institutional models was an adaptive response. This points, though, to another proviso about the evolution of chiropractic. The chiropractic population hit a high mark in the early 1930s, when there were possibly 30,000 active chiropractors. It then fell for the next several decades.94 This fact should nuance how one thinks about the technical victories associated with the maturation of the profession. Through the mid-twentieth century, chiropractic became known in American culture as a social reality. Despite proclamations across the chiropractic spectrum, however, it is difficult to say the profession fully convinced Americans that the practice was a public \"good.\" Chiropractors knew their social position was by no means secure, which perpetuated the cycle of ambiguous placement like those described in R. L. Moore's Religious Outsiders. Their ambivalence raises an important issue that deserves more attention in chiropractic history. More than a few chiropractors were led to participate in other groups with complicated stances toward majority culture. Chiropractors have often shown an elective affinity for rank dissent that appears to be more than the activities of aberrant individuals. The best-known of such chiropractic affiliations are with other medical protests. Through much of the twentieth century, chiropractors spearheaded opposition to compulsory vaccination and joined campaigns against the fluoridation of water.95 Less documented is their participation in other reactionary social movements, whose distinct cultural belligerence seems to have appealed to a segment of the chiropractic profession. 218 h i s t o r y r e p e at s the dark side of populism Chiropractic engaged interwar populism on an uneven and ambiguous terrain. In the 1920s many chiropractors were receptive to the message of the Ku Klux Klan. It should not surprise readers that chiropractors placed advertisements in Klan newspapers and sometimes joined local chapters. Geographically, the original strongholds for chiropractic overlapped with nativism and Christian Fundamentalism, and while the movement did not make identity politics a priority, chiropractors' aspirations to respectability presupposed whiteness, masculinity, and freedom from ethnic ties.96 It is difficult to document chiropractic participation in the Ku Klux Klan, because membership rosters were kept secret, but there are clues to support the assertion by David A. Horowitz that the Klan intentionally sought chiropractors as members.97 Opponents of the Klan in Buffalo, NY published an expose in 1924, naming members and listing their occupations; four chiropractors were identified.98 Kenneth T. Jackson found a report on the occupational distribution of professions in Winchester, Illinois, in which chiropractors accounted for 3 of 180 KKK members, and 3 out of 46 professionals.99 And in California, chiropractor James Kem Glenn served as a Nighthawk in the Los Angeles Klan No. 1, at least until his participation was revealed in an acrimonious divorce suit.100 Because the KKK also worked at the boundary of majoritarian and oppositional social stances, it is unclear whether chiropractors' involvement was motivated by civic engagement, cultural dissent, or personal bigotries. The years immediately following World War I saw an attempt by the KKK to redefine itself as a mainstream American fraternal order. It cloaked its racist, anti-Catholic, and anti-immigrant agendas in a campaign of civic virtue and community activism. The KKK tried to create a perception of social good, but it was widely rejected by much of the public as a subversive organization. Members were sometimes publicly censured when their affiliation became known. Such was the case for R. E. Ellsworth, who resigned his presidency of the Oregon Board of Chiropractic Examiners after the governor asked all state officers and board members involved with the Klan to leave their government positions.101 Despite the dual attraction of popular protest and respectability, there were risks and rewards to chiropractors in joining the Klan movement. With boycotts of member businesses a constant threat, the KKK encouraged its ranks to patronize each other's establishments. Yet chiropractic was and is controversial in far-right groups, and many Klansmen were opposed to its practitioners. In later life, Herbert Ross Reaver, an early supporter of chiropractic h i s t o r y r e p e at s 219 integration, remembered being intimidated by Klansmen in Florida for treating African Americans.102 In Illinois three Klansmen beat a chiropractor for mismanaging the treatment of a teenage girl.103 Nativism was not an incentive for chiropractors, who had little enthusiasm for the anti-Catholicism that grew Klan membership in the 1920s. But racially driven sentiments affected admissions policies at many chiropractic colleges. \"Negroes not accepted\" became an official Palmer statement in the 1920s, and the racial ban stayed in place until the Brown v. Board of Education ruling in 1954.104 Furthermore, B. J. was known for his anti-Semitism and had been accused of being a Nazi sympathizer.105 He stuck to these views even after World War II, and in 1950 advised his readers to \"recall Napoleon, Hitler, Mussolini, and Stalin. Recall, also, Lincoln, Jefferson, Wilson, Hoover, and Coolidge. Recall damage AND good each of these groups served.\"106 But the PSC was not the only chiropractic college to refuse admission to black students, which indicates the pervasiveness of racist attitudes. Nearly all maintained at least a passive racial ban, with few attempts to enroll black students. Chiropractic's uncomfortable racial history did not end with the Brown decision, either in chronology or scope. A small number of African Americans did obtain chiropractic training during the Jim Crow era, through correspondence courses or at schools without racial bans. Some of these, like Ross College of Chiropractic in Fort Wayne, Indiana, were operated by white chiropractors. Others were established by African Americans such as Fred H. H. Rubel, a National School graduate, who opened the Rubel College of Chiropractic in Chicago in the early 1920s.107 These options meant that by the 1920s a small number of African American chiropractors could be found in cities like St. Louis and Washington, D.C. Advertisements for their practices and reports of their civic involvement are preserved in the black press. No historically black chiropractic colleges have survived, however, and African Americans still represent only a sliver of the chiropractic population.108 Some chiropractic historians, especially Glenda C. Wiese, have begun to chronicle the history of the historically black chiropractic colleges and to document current conditions in the profession regarding race.109 the fruits of chiropractic philosophy B. J.'s steadfast commitment at the PSC to the proprietary model stood in direct contrast with many chiropractic colleges of its size and aspirations. Eschewing the nonprofit model allowed the PSC to cultivate its sectarian elements more deeply. The clearest advantage went to B. J., who was spared 220 h i s t o r y r e p e at s having to answer to a board of trustees. It also meant that the school could offer a degree program that was shorter and cheaper than other chiropractic schools. Despite often operating on the slimmest of margins, the PSC remained open while rival schools merged or closed entirely. In fact, into the 1970s Palmer granted three-quarters of all chiropractic degrees.110 The capstone of B. J. Palmer's industries, and what shielded him from marginalization in chiropractic, was his media holdings. Here, his flamboyant personality worked to his advantage. As early as 1925, WOC had one million listeners a day.111 The radio station made B. J. a familiar figure to Americans and made possible another venture beyond the chiropractic world. 'Round the World with B. J., the book that anthologized transcripts of B. J.'s travel reports from his trips around the Pacific, was well-received and commercially profitable. The book also spoke to B. J.'s genuine skills as a raconteur. In 1927 the federal government changed its regulations on radio broadcasters, who from then on were allowed to accept commercial advertising. After that, B. J.'s radio business provided a steady stream of income\u2014enough for the Palmer family to live comfortably and to indulge B. J.'s interests and hobbies. In 1930 B. J. acquired a second radio station, WHO in Des Moines. At 50,000 watts, the broadcast power of WHO was much larger than WOC. In 1949 the broadcast holdings of the Palmers later increased to include WOC-TV, the first NBC television affiliate in Iowa. The income from the broadcast communications helped subsidize B. J.'s chiropractic interests in times of need. Radio and television directly affected Chiropractic Philosophy, for B. J.'s investigations into \"Direct Mental Impulse\" led him to regard the brain as an electrical transmission receiver and converter. B. J. used revisions to Chiropractic Philosophy as a means of maintaining his relevance to the field of chiropractic. Well before 1920, B. J. was vigorously promoting the idea that Innate Intelligence was an immanent manifestation of God in human beings: \"Knowledge says God is health, is religion, is law. I find God everywhere and more especially in living things and all things live. The nearer we reach the unhindered flow of God in human beings the closer are we in communion.\"112 B. J. posited this immanent power as the organizing principle of the entire natural world, which was the \"progress of dual evolution of thot and matter.\"113 B. J. was echoing something D. D. also had asserted: that Universal Intelligence (\"thot\") expressed itself through \"matter.\" For both Palmers, all life was a manifestation of this single, ultimate reality. B. J. maintained that chiropractic stood out among healthcare options for its ability to harness the \"Inner Power\" of life. h i s t o r y r e p e at s 221 Catherine Albanese has called attention to how strongly the worldview of Harmonials could be opposed to the idea of \"matter.\" American Metaphysicians hoped to transcend the material world, in order to commune with the spiritual reality that was its true essence. In contrast, Chiropractic Philosophy reaffirmed the reality of matter independent of spirit. Something Fred Barge, a Straight chiropractic thinker, once said to me highlights the key difference: \"Chiropractic has always accepted the immutability of Matter.\" From a practical point of view, the system deals with the hard substance of bone, a body tissue that is difficult to physically change. But the chiropractic view of matter also shows an independence from prevalent Metaphysical understandings. Chiropractic Philosophy presented a material cathexis not easily available to Metaphysical interpretations that stressed the interchangeability of matter and spirit. For Metaphysical traditions to assert that physical reality had no fundamental base was to ask believers to suppress the constant stream of evidence from their sense perceptions. One of the criticisms the philosopher William James threw against the Metaphysical movement was the emotional toll exacted by this mental gymnastic.114 Chiropractic thus directed itself to an investment in the material rather than a denial of it. A good snapshot for where things had gone in the wake of the Neurocalometer is one of the Green Books, first published in 1927. B. J. was not the author of the Chiropractic Textbook.115 That honor went to Ralph W. Stephenson, who was an instructor at the Palmer School. The Chiropractic Textbook illustrated B. J.'s capacity for collaboration, despite his reputation for autocracy. While the wording was the product of Stephenson's efforts, most of the ideas came from B. J., who gave it a ringing endorsement. Stephenson's work was intended as a comprehensive study of chiropractic theory and practice. Chiropractic Philosophy was not, therefore, its sole focus. Stephenson echoed B. J.'s assertive stance on inductive science. He affirmed \"Direct Mental Impulse,\" which had grown to include the idea of the brain as the transformer for Universal and Innate Intelligence. Stephenson also detailed the circuitry for the transmission of Innate from the brain to bodily parts through the \"Safety Pin Cycle.\" The detailed discussions of these ideas made the Chiropractic Textbook the most complete codification of Straight theory. Many of its propositions endure in contemporary chiropractic. The Chiropractic Textbook included a list of thirty-three fundamental \"Chiropractic Principles,\" which established a metaphysical theory as a core 222 h i s t o r y r e p e at s doctrine for Straight chiropractic.116 The first three principles explained the true nature of the world: 1. The Major Premise: A Universal Intelligence is in all matter and continually gives to it all its properties and actions, thus maintaining it in existence. 2. The Chiropractic Meaning of Life: The expression of this intelligence through matter is the chiropractic meaning of life. 3. The Union of Intelligence and Matter: Life is necessarily the union of intelligence and matter.117 The first principle and most important asserted that the world is knit together by a \"cosmic consciousness.\" For Stephenson and B. J., this was self-evident, a rare \"empirical truth\" one could allow into the deductive science of chiropractic. Reading like a chiropractic Articles of Faith, the assertive spiritualization was unequivocally a response to Mixers who hoped to reduce theological speculation in the profession. But the thirty-three Principles also positioned Chiropractic Philosophy in the larger culture of spiritual healing. Though engaged with many of its ideas, B. J., Stephenson, and other Straight chiropractors also departed from the conventional wisdom of American alternative spirituality. Their understanding of matter illustrated how B. J. Palmer and his associates took issue with some assumptions popular in American Metaphysical thought. Harmonials usually connected the physical world to a higher spiritual reality. At its base level of being, \"matter\" was either interchangeable with the spiritual, or was dependent on and subordinate to it, so as to be something one hoped to transcend. It is hard to think of a Metaphysical system more \"matter positive\" than chiropractic. In the thirty-three Principles, matter and spirit were recognized as two distinct entities, seen in the second and third Principles. Farther down, the t wenty-fourth Principle affirmed the immutability of matter: \"Innate Intelligence adapts forces and matter for the body as long as it can do so without breaking a universal law, i.e., Innate Intelligence is limited by the limitations of matter.\" Since it was first articulated, this point has been important in Straight chiropractors' explanations of the efficacy of their practice. It is invoked to explain the morbid effects of vertebral subluxation; the hard structures of the human vertebrae can block proper vital activity. The immutability of matter also has been used to explain both why human beings cannot simply \"think themselves well\" by accessing cosmic consciousness. Furthermore, it long has been invoked as a reason why even chiropractic is sometimes not effective. h i s t o r y r e p e at s 223 An even more dramatic example can be found in the eleventh Principle, which asserts that Universal Intelligence is an impersonal force that is not invested in the outcome of individual human beings: \"The Character of Universal Forces: The forces of Universal Intelligence are manifested by physical laws, are unswerving and unadapted, and have no solicitude for the structures in which they work.\"118 Taken to its logical conclusion, the deity presented in the thirty-three Principles is a \"disinterested god.\" I want to point out the potential implications of this idea, and what it says about chiropractic thought. Different Metaphysical subtraditions have had highly nuanced understandings of the relationship between the human being and the divine. Some groups, like the Emmanuel Movement, retain a relational model in which the god force is personal.119 Many New Age practitioners, however, interpret the divine as a \"force\" or \"spiritual energy,\" which lacks the human qualities associated with anthropomorphic monotheism. Farther over on the spectrum one might place Theosophy, where the universe is seen as running on karma\u2014an impersonal, universal \"law.\"120 The thirty-three Chiropractic Principles followed a similar orientation. If the understanding of God aligned chiropractic with esotericism, it set great distance between chiropractic thought and how most Americans responded, intellectually and emotionally, to religious questions. For the majority of Christians in the United States, the deity is understood as personal, holding the potential to partner in spiritual relationships and often having human qualities. Similarly, most forms of alternative spirituality have conceived of the force animating the universe as benign to human concerns: if not anthropomorphic, then at least \"providential.\" In contrast, the Chiropractic Principles argued for the detachment of Universal Intelligence from human experience. The assertion that Universal Intelligence had no \"personal solicitude for the individual\" implied that the most powerful force in the universe was not aligned with the needs and wants of humanity, at least in ways that humans could easily appreciate. Even set among the array of alternative American spiritualities, this was a radical position. For B. J., Innate Intelligence might be immanent, but Universal Intelligence was transcendent to the point of being \"wholly other,\" with divine priorities quite different from our own, earthly ones. Consistency never concerned him, and so B. J. also wrote extensively on the essential goodness of the universe. The fundamental disconnect between the purposes of God and Man made it a \"libertarian theology\"\u2014a creed for self-reliance\u2014even compared to other Metaphysical systems. B. J.'s theology portrayed the ideal human as a lone figure who is misunderstood and opposed by the universe. The context for the 224 h i s t o r y r e p e at s articulation of this ideal is important, for in the 1920s he and many others in the chiropractic profession felt underpaid and under attack. The \"disinterested god\" of Super Straight theory never caught on in the profession. Deeply at odds with the personalized monotheism of Christianity, which stressed humanity's need for relationship with God, it became a source of conflict in the chiropractic sub-culture. Contemporary chiropractic discourse shows that chiropractors with strong religious commitments experience tension between Straight philosophy and beliefs undergirding their faith. There is reason to believe the issue caused similar questioning in the 1920s, but individuals seem to have been tasked with finding answers privately. Nor did the pedagogy at chiropractic colleges encourage much dissent. This was especially true at Palmer School, where from introductory class questions to their final senior theses, students were expected to absorb and recapitulate the Palmer version of the science of chiropractic with catechism-like precision. The compatibility of chiropractic principles with personal monotheism was likely to have been addressed in the chapter of the InterVarsity Christian Fellowship organized at Palmer in the early 1950s, which formally incorporated as the Christian Chiropractors Association in 1963. Then and now, the primary purpose of the CCA is to support chiropractic missionary work, which includes both evangelism and chiropractic care. A secondary project, however, and one that features strongly in CCA publications, is the reconciliation of Evangelical Christian theology with Chiropractic Philosophy. Contributors to The Christian Chiropractor are engaged in the reinterpretation of the chiropractic intelligences, so as to make the distinction between \"theistic\" vitalism (the correct view) and \"metaphysical\" or \"naive\" vitalist theories.121 Instead of understanding Innate as a coextensive microcosm of an impersonal \"Higher Power,\" Innate is thought to be an indwelling force bestowed by a benevolent creator. Glenn M. Hultgren, a leader and past president in the CCA, makes this point quite clearly: \"As Christians, we would reject the teachings about universal intelligence being a pantheistic god. . . . The problem for the Christian is the personification of innate and the assignment to innate the properties of universal intelligence when universal intelligence is given god-like qualities. However we would have no problem if universal intelligence is an attribute of our supreme personal God, and innate is the life principle which god placed into all living things.\"122 It should come as no surprise to see chiropractic ideas prompt this type of religious inquiry. h i s t o r y r e p e at s 225 fa m i ly b u s i n e s s It was a happy accident that B. J.'s fondness for technology encouraged his early entry into the radio business. His fortunes in chiropractic were not so untrammeled. In 1929, a bank which held many assets of both the Palmer family and the PSC failed following the stock market crash.123 It was in the midst of the ensuing crisis that B. J.'s son Dave joined the family business, which survived mainly because of his acumen. The loyalty of Dave Palmer to the family brand may have been unexpected, in light of the conflict that stood between him and his father. B. J. Palmer viewed his relationship with Dave through the lens of his own harsh childhood. D. D. is said to have withdrawn B. J. from school in eighth grade as punishment for a prank that involved bringing a box of mice into the classroom. Suspicious of higher education, B. J. opposed Dave's acceptance to the University of Pennsylvania. This apparently triggered a conflict between him and Mabel. On the encouragement of both his mother and some faculty at the PSC, Dave enrolled to study business at the Wharton School. The depths of B. J.'s anger were manifest in his refusal to acknowledge Dave when he returned home for winter break during his freshman year. Dave Palmer resembled his parents in different ways. Like B. J., Dave inverted his birth name (Daniel David Palmer). His career at school may have been no more successful than that of his father. Dave did not graduate from Penn, and there is reason to think he might have left the school, after nearly four years of study, under fraught circumstances.124 He seems to have inherited his temperament from his mother, a peacemaker with Midwestern \"grit.\" His commitments to dialogue and collaboration were manifest in both his professional and personal relationships. Religiously, Dave was Episcopalian, with a strong commitment to interfaith dialogue. He participated in the International Conference of Christians and Jews, and was named a B'nai B'rith \"Man of the Year\" in 1967. Upon Dave's return to Davenport, some of the faculty persuaded B. J. to allow Dave to begin managing the business operations. Dave may have raised eyebrows when he fired Frank Elliott, who had been the business manager for close to 20 years. But Dave proved to be an asset to the Palmer enterprises, adopting creative strategies to help the Palmer School survive its lean years. Eager to provide tuition assistance to impoverished students, he arranged for a local business to hire Palmer students to wash windows. The carpentry shop was converted into a mop company; the auditorium became a roller 226 h i s t o r y r e p e at s David Daniel Palmer, who moved Palmer College of Chiropractic away from its proprietary model toward being a nonprofit educational institution. Archives, David D. Palmer Health Sciences Library/ Palmer College of Chiropractic. skating rink. Dave also opened a gas station and \"root beer\" stand on campus grounds\u2014the latter may have been a speakeasy.125 Dave Palmer's receptivity to new business ventures represented a continuation of his family's approach to making money, and a determination to keep the family business alive. Dave grew skillful at managing his father, smoothing over conflicts B. J. had created. At WOC radio, he hired back a young sportscaster named Ronald Reagan after B. J. had fired him (for forgetting to mention on-air the mortuary sponsoring a music program).126 Dave and B. J. are remembered to have fought bitterly and often, but B. J. was known to back down in the face of united opposition. Reagan and Dave Palmer remained cordial for many years, evidenced in a signed photo Reagan gave Dave decades later. Although Dave and B. J. were willing to do anything on the right side of the law to help the Palmer School survive, its future was uncertain through much of the Depression. From a one-time high of nearly 3,000, enrollment dropped to about 200 students.127 The fact that the PSC ran as a proprietary enterprise h i s t o r y r e p e at s 227 may have helped it remain open. A regular medical college might not have set students to work making mops to offset operating expenses. By 1935 the school was on stable enough footing to withstand the $1 million cost of opening the B. J. Palmer Chiropractic Clinic.128 Conflating the therapeutic and theatric, B. J. would have patients who had made the pilgrimage to Davenport be met by a white ambulance at the train station. In the clinic itself, emulation of the allopathic medical experience was manifest. Patients were evaluated on steel adjusting tables, hygienically draped with white cotton, and then subjected to a dazzling technological experience, as their conditions were evaluated by x-ray machines, spinographs, electrocardiographs, fluoroscopies, \"protractorscopes,\" and \"conturagraphometers.\" The research conducted by the B. J. Palmer Clinic helped legitimate the distinct version of chiropractic theory B. J. was still refining. B. J. came to insist that virtually all spinal problems, and in fact all health problems, were caused by the misalignment or subluxation of the first cervical vertebra. In 1934 he began calling his system of atlas adjustment \"Hole-In-One,\" borrowing the term from golf.129 Remarkably, a \"strong\" HIO perspective would pay minimal attention to the back, even for a back problem. This discovery set B. J. apart from many Straights, as well as Mixers. Today, Hole-in-One is less popular than decades past, but it stands as the reason some chiropractors adjust necks. B. J.'s assertion of doctrinal power coincided with a major change in his personal life. In the late 1930s, Mabel moved to Arizona, ostensibly for her health. Sources close to her attribute her departure for a sunnier climate to strains in her marriage.130 The separation could be read as an indictment of B. J.'s behavior. Mabel is remembered as a gracious woman, the \"Sweetheart of the PSC.\" It is unlikely she was the cause of most of the friction with B. J. Mabel's role at the PSC attests to the strength of her character. She had become more than a \"helpmeet\" to B. J.; she was a senior instructor of anatomy at the college, and held administrative duties as treasurer and secretary. Mabel's departure summons tropes of the \"fed-up wife,\" but it also was the ending of a collaborative professional relationship, evocative of the breaks with Loban, Langworthy, Morris, and the \"Big Four.\" B. J. Palmer appears to have coped with the separation from Mabel by devoting himself to chiropractic. Their estrangement corresponded with a burst of spiritual writing that lasted nearly fifteen years. Yet B. J. could not ignore the real-life forces moving around him. Though the PSC was both Straight and proprietary, in 1940 it joined the Allied Chiropractic Educational Institutions, then the largest accrediting organization.131 Determined 228 h i s t o r y r e p e at s to keep its autonomy, the Palmer School was able to retain control over its curriculum after admission to the Mixer-backed organization, but soon it was prompted to rethink its stance. The shift at Palmer School to \"upper cervical\" had affected both students' education and prospects for survival in a chiropractic world. By the 1940s, Palmer graduates showed real difficulties passing state licensure exams. The school did not teach full-spine adjusting, which figured prominently on the tests. The policy at Palmer was changed in 1950.132 Necessity had extracted a painful concession from B. J., who from then on watched students at the school he had led for nearly 50 years learn an opposing chiropractic theory. Mabel Palmer died in 1949. After her death, the depth of the rift between B. J. and her was made manifest, for Mabel's will left all her stock in the Palmer School, as well as her interests in the radio business, to her three granddaughters. The greatest shock to B. J. was that Mabel also left them the Palmer Mansion, which had been signed over to her years before. B. J. was granted the right to live there until he died, but he no longer officially owned the house he lived in.133 The terms of the will were a blow. Though the arrangement was imposed by his (now deceased) wife, the functional result was B. J.'s loss of property to his progeny, evocative of D. D.'s dispossession several decades earlier. the glory of going on B. J. began to divide his time between Davenport and his vacation home in Sarasota, Florida. The icy winters on the Mississippi River drove him south, but he chose Sarasota to be by the Ringling Brothers winter headquarters. B. J. always loved the circus. Rising very early in order to write at a continuous-roll typewriter, he hammered out the Fountain Head News until 1960, and only stopped when his health failed him months before his death. In the last years of his life, B. J. spent considerable time chronicling his life's work. Pamphlets and documents important to the early chiropractic movement were compiled and issued in a book called History Repeats.134 In 1953 he released a second book of travel stories, based on his journeys in the 1920s, Upside Down and Right Side Up with B. J.135 B. J. devoted the greatest attention to spiritual investigations. This period witnessed the full fruition of his specialized spiritual vocabulary. For example, B. J. described the power of God immanent in human beings as the \"Big Fellow Within.\" In similar terms, cosmic consciousness was the \"Giant\" brain that dwarfed the \"Pygmy\" consciousness of the human mind.136 In close h i s t o r y r e p e at s 229 connection with this last idea, B. J. sometimes claimed that people had, essentially, \"two brains\"\u2014that Innate and Educated resided in and directed distinct organs, which modern anatomy had yet to fully separate.137 While B. J. often used such highly personalized terminology, many of his ideas were in keeping with those of the Metaphysical tradition, like his receptivity to the Neoplatonic worldview: \" 'Nature' is Innate Intelligence; Innate Intelligence is Universal Intelligence; and Universal Intelligence is God. God is infinitude, and consequently all attributes that we conceive we give to God. God is but a name we educationally give to ruling power of matter. We do not comprehend it, except in part. All truth is it. God is neither he nor she\u2014it is thon. Being a spirituality it is sexless, formless, and only assumes form or sex, shape or color according to object in which it personifies itself, be it tree, animal or man.\"138 B. J. understood Universal Intelligence as generally \"good.\" He assured readers in a frequently syndicated promise, \"The master maker of the human body did not create you and then run off and leave you masterless. He stayed on the job as innate, as the fellow within, as nerve transmission controlling every function of life, as spirit from above-down, inside-out, expressing, creating, exploring, directing you in every field and phase of experience so that your home is truly the world and the world is your home.\"139 B. J. thought human communication with Universal Intelligence was possible through \"following Innate,\" which he credited as the source of his own power and inspiration. Ever an optimist, B. J. made this sound easy to do\u2014As Simple as That! became the title of another of his books. Yet he wrote long meditations that suggest things were more complicated. Did humans \"reach up\" to Cosmic Consciousness, or did it \"extend down\"? If the latter, it was not certain whether human beings have any ability to draw its power at all. To communicate this point, B. J. reconfigured the statement, \"All roads that are good lead to God,\" popularly attributed to Marcus Bach, to his own proposition that \"All roads that lead from God to Man, from Above-Down, Inside-Out, are good.\"140 Similarly, he drew on the phraseology of Ralph Waldo Trine, whom he often quoted.141 The language of Trine's recommendation to be \"in tune with the Infinite\" stood in the background of B. J.'s own descriptions of the relationship of human beings to the divine. Lying, usually buried, in us is an Innate Intelligence. If we could open those flood gates and let Innate flow, we would be as good and as great as it, itself. Lying in all of us is our Innate selves. 230 h i s t o r y r e p e at s Innate is God in human beings is good in human beings is life in human beings is health in human beings is sane in human beings. Let Innate flow in and through us and we can accomplish the great wonders.142 B. J. maintained cordial relations with many New Thought figures, including Marcus Bach and Napoleon Hill. Yet even while emulating New Thought teachers and incorporating their ideas into his own work, B. J. endeavored to distinguish himself from them. His personal vocabulary had the functional result of keeping Chiropractic Philosophy separate from other forms of popular Metaphysics. He took issue with the belief that humans could access and harness the power of God for practical purposes. Instead, he insisted that God contacted human beings. B. J. characterized this dynamic as \"Above-Down, Inside-Out.\" \"Every living person, everywhere, can look into the mirror and see and understand there IS a LIVING 'GOD' WITHIN HIM that flows from ABOVE-DOWN, INSIDE-OUT, which will make him well if sick, make him a better person in his relationship to IT.\"143 In 1949, B. J. Palmer published his religious magnum opus, The Bigness of the Fellow Within. In structure and function, B. J.'s book bore striking similarities to The Chiropractor's Adjuster. Each was a compilation of articles, with many written by other sources. Meant to engage both science and religion, both books included medical texts, especially excerpts about the nervous system. The works came out at a similar life stage for the two Palmers, when spiritual reflection was becoming ever more important to each. Like his father, B. J. asserted a Metaphysical philosophy. And as with D. D., B. J.'s publication gave occasion for him to air grievances against rivals and opponents. Not fully in D. D.'s shadow, B. J. built on his father's vocabulary but developed metaphors of his own. The \"Big Fellow\" was Innate Intelligence, understood as the indwelling manifestation of Universal Intelligence and the source of all healing: \"You and I are two individuals, two personalities, two people, living in the same house. The big fellow within. The little fellow outside. When you and I can learn to respect and look up to the Innate within, in the same understanding way and with the same admirable respect we think of the of God of the universe, we will get somewhere in understanding ourselves.\"144 Like the passage above, much of the book affirmed the idea that cosmic consciousness was greater than individual personality, and that understanding the link h i s t o r y r e p e at s 231 between the two was the key to unlocking human potential. \"When you and I reach that stage of understanding of the immensity of the gigantic value of the Innate within us, and learn to respect its superior knowledge of how to direct and run this body of ours\u2014we will have reached the stage of development to humble ourselves also at the Wisdom of the greatness of \"The Kingdom of God that is within us.\"145 Yet like D. D., B. J. Palmer had little esteem for organized religion: There is nothing wrong with the Christ or the principles of Christianity or one who tries to live the spirit thereof, but there certainly is much to be desired and corrected in too much churchianity being forced on people in and under the guise of being Christianity. . . . Religions set up the necessity for at least one intermediary between man and God\u2014a third personality to think and act for one\u2014to have God contact man and see that his appeals for help and prayers are answered. It appears that only this third personality can \"save\" him. . . . If \"God\" is everywhere (and who is to say to the contrary), and if \"The Kingdom of God Is Within You,\" then no third or fourth person is necessary. . . . The preacher, regardless of what he believes and preaches, interprets The Book as he believes, and then passes it on to his listeners. Why hasn't any other person the same right? Does his having gone to a seminary or college give him the exclusive right to interpret printed words for all to read; or does that give him exclusive right to think his way the only right way?146 Christian imagery was a means through which B. J. could connect with his readers. More importantly, it reflected B. J.'s own sense of being a participant in a cosmic historical drama. B. J. took to heart Jesus' statement, \"The Kingdom of God is within you,\" which he often quoted. B. J. nonetheless opposed framing chiropractic as a religious institution. Echoing D. D.'s disclaimers in \"The Moral and Religious Duty of a Chiropractor,\" B. J. wrote, \"Chiropractic is not a religion in the ordinary, accepted, and usual understanding of that term as religions exist now and have existed for centuries and are established in the minds of human conduct. . . . The principles and practices of Chiropractic cannot be made into a religion. . . . Religions have saviors, apostles, and a Koran or Bible, establishing an intermediary between man according to the particular kind of God in which that religion believes. They create abstract language which is to be taken as texts, repeated and interpreted by preachers who preach and cannot practice what they preach because nothing they preach is subject to proof because they are based on what they 'believe' and 232 h i s t o r y r e p e at s 'have faith' in.\"147 Times had changed for the chiropractic system, and styling it as a religion was less attractive than decades before. But the passage above underscores the anti-institutionalism that permeated B. J.'s spirituality. By this point in his life, B. J. seems to have entertained the notion that the world was vibratory, the base of D. D.'s Third Theory.148 This shift did not dramatically change his chiropractic ideas, but it is one of a number of clues attesting to B. J.'s esotericist bent.149 He cited Rosicrucian author Hargrave Jennings in his chapter on \"Phallic Worship\" and recommended to his readers the work of W. Scott-Elliott and Rudolph Steiner as authorities on the lost continents of Atlantis, Mu, and Lemuria. An entire chapter of The Bigness of the Fellow Within was devoted to \"The Baconian Controversy,\" in which B. J. referenced Ignatius Donnelly, whom he clearly had read. It is a black eye on B. J. that he also plagiarized passages from H. Crouch Batchelor's book Francis Bacon Wrote Shakespeare.150 Google Books and Boolean search technology make evident something B. J.'s readers may have suspected but could not prove: B. J. took liberally from other sources. B. J.'s writing carried other extended metaphors in addition to ones from Christianity. In keeping with his own involvement in telecommunications, B. J. compared God to a radio station transmitting benevolent power, which he gave the call letters, \"G-O-D.\" \"God is broadcasting harmony, good, bright, cheerful, constructive, growing, healthful, legal thoughts and actions to all the world all the time. . . . Your mind is a receiving station: you may tune in on any wave length you wish, whether it be kindness, high and steadfast thots, beauty, helpfulness, or the lower ones of evil. And remember, when you tune in on one, you are tuning out all others.\"151 In laying out the theory of human brains as radio receivers for God's energy, B. J. made a revealing statement about science and religion: \"The trouble with science is it hasn't enough religion. The trouble with religion is it hasn't enough science. . . . Get your Christianity scientifically. Get your sciences Christianized. Get more God in your sciences and more science in your God.\"152 The radio analogy explained both B. J.'s metaphysics and understanding of biology: \"Brain is seat or originating place of all power, force or energy. Spinal cord is great cable transmitter, nerves branching there from the smaller segmental distributors of life force. Its place of origin being mind, its product must be in keeping mental impulses. Origin being in brain, its place of expression, the organ, then life in all human being is in brain but is expressed at periphery\u2014tissue cell. Life, physiologically considered, has a beginning at brain cell but has personification at tissue cell.\"153 The odd syntax of this passage reflects the unfinished quality of much of B. J.'s writing. Composed at an ever more frenetic pace, h i s t o r y r e p e at s 233 many texts appear to have been subject to little, if any, revision or proofreading. Excerpts like the preceding one may well have been \"brainstorms,\" jotted down in passing, and later preserved for posterity in the Green Books series. Such fragments of text speak volumes about B. J.'s character and mental world. To say that \"B. J. never threw anything away\" is to echo the words of many chiropractic historians. B. J. gathered objects and facts. He amassed collections of bladed weapons and phallic sexual art that were among the most extensive of their day. Collecting everything he could find on all things chiropractic, his personal papers were saved in hundreds of file cabinets, which he stored in the elevator shaft of Palmer Mansion. They were discovered decades later in a renovation to the building. There is possibly no more tangible evidence of B. J.'s eclecticism slipping into chaos than this solid block\u2014hundreds of cubic feet\u2014of chiropractic lore. By the 1950s B. J.'s involvement in the administration of the Palmer School was diminished. B. J. was well into his seventies, and he began spending ever greater amounts of time in Florida.154 Old age made him accept what must have felt like a tremendous indignity. Although a lifelong opponent of regular physicians, B. J. was forced to seek medical treatment for several serious health problems.155 B. J. began suffering from duodenal ulcers, and reluctantly consented to an operation. He experienced bladder and prostrate trouble, as well as intestinal blockages for which he also had surgery. A new round of symptoms appeared in 1960. They first pointed to a recurrence of peptic ulcers, but tests soon confirmed B. J. had colon cancer. Doctors declared his case terminal, but operated with the intent of making him more comfortable. B. J. Palmer died in late May 1961. His memorial service was held at the Masonic Temple in Davenport. The officiant was his friend Marcus Bach, whose work, The Chiropractic Story, had promoted chiropractic to thousands of Americans.156 Perhaps no writer has captured the Palmer character better than Frank Elliott. Although writing about D. D., his observations equally apply to B. J.: \"He was so argumentative that he irritated everyone whom he contacted. At times he was most affable but one had only to express an opinion and the war was on so far as he was concerned. He was a brilliant self-educated man in many respects and on Chiropractic a logical and clear thinker, but on most other subjects he was erratic and belligerent. With all his faults, God rest his soul, he left for us a splendid heritage which we must preserve and develop for the benefit of posterity.\"157 With alliterative style, Elliott captured the paradoxes of the Palmer character: \"affable\" but \"argumentative,\" \"brilliant\" and \"belligerent.\" The Palmers were intensely creative, but had difficulty seeing 234 h i s t o r y r e p e at s others' points of view. This trait created in them a real confusion of interests, their own and those of the chiropractic profession. American originals they might be, but B. J. and D. D. were both selfish, dishonest, and unnecessarily provocative in their dealings with people. Evaluating their biographies, it is hard to decide which of the two of them was worse. When annoyed by the hymn-singing of a group of Salvation Army \"Hallelujah Lasses\" beneath his Brady Street office, D. D. dispersed the women by throwing buckets of water through the window. While D. D.'s temper was marked by reactive volatility, B. J. could hold a grudge for a long time. Dave Palmer was appalled by the vindictiveness B. J. carried against Davenport business and civic leaders whom he felt had snubbed him. B. J. staged a banquet, inviting 800 people to \"bury the hatchet\" about old disagreements, but his after-dinner speech was a full excoriation of Davenport society\u2014a \"hatchet-job\" instead. The play on words was intentional, for each guest was sent home with a commemoration of the dressing down, in the form of a miniature hatchet party-favor.158 B. J.'s relentless belief in himself highlights the role of personality in social history. He became a cartoon character\u2014literally, when in 1947 the International Chiropractors Association issued a story-poster of his life. B. J. was represented as a serious pioneer into new knowledge, reflective of other popular twentieth-century heroic depictions. In real life, however, B. J. was very difficult to comprehend as a person. Cyrus Lerner found strong exaggerations in several of the claims that B. J. made about himself; these undermined confidence in his persona. Despite his blustery \"passion\" for deep-sea fishing, B. J. seems to have only ventured out in a boat once or twice; he may actually have been afraid of the water. Other hobbies also do not stand up to scrutiny: most of the Asian art in the Palmer Mansion, on which B. J. based his reputation as a connoisseur, was actually bought en masse from the Mission Inn in Riverside, California.159 Lerner felt the discrepancies between fact and fiction in B. J.'s biography were a central problem in interpreting his character. I understand his frustration, after having spent so much time with B. J. myself. Looking past his showmanship, many aspects of B. J.'s life were kept intensely private, and he seems to have worked quite hard to make his vulnerabilities impenetrable. B. J.'s struggles with authenticity pervaded even his most personally presented spiritual writing. The Bigness of the Fellow Within relates a \"conversion experience\" B. J. said happened when he was a teenager, which had long-term consequences for his success in life. It is a dramatic parallel construction to the ideal-typical narratives from Evangelical Protestantism, starting with the h i s t o r y r e p e at s 235 \"Builders of America.\" In 1947 the International Chiropractors Association printed this testimonial to B. J. Palmer as a poster. Archives, David D. Palmer Health Sciences Library/Palmer College of Chiropractic. opening scene of having hit the depths of religious despair. The story literally begins in a jail cell, where B. J. experiences a dream in which he encounters an ultimate reality that renews his sense of purpose. His salvation comes, not in knowing Jesus as a personal savior, but as intuitive comprehension of Metaphysical philosophy: I saw myself start, my eyes opened, and I dreamed that I saw. \"What awakened me?\" I asked in my dream. \"You awakened yourself,\" answered a voice nearby. I turned about, but no one was near. \"Who are you?\" I asked. \"I am 'That Something,' \" came the reply. \"But where are you?\" \"I am hidden in your soul.\" For some moments I thought over what was said. Then I stammered, \"How\u2014how did you get there?\" \"I was born there.\" \"Why have I not known you were there before?\" \"No man knows it,\" answered the voice, \"until he \"Are you men's \"There is 'That Something' in every man's soul, which can move the mountains or dry the seas.\" \"Then you must be Faith!\" \"Yes,\" came the answer, \"I am Faith, but I am more\u2014I am that which makes men face the fires of hell, and win.\" \"Then you must be Confidence, as well.\" \"Yes, I am more than Confidence\u2014I am that which makes the babbling brooks lift worlds upon their wavelets.\" \"You are Power,\" I cried. \"Yes, I am more than Power,\" answered the voice. \"I am that which makes the wretched failure lift up himself and rule the world.\" \"You are Ambition\u2014I know you now.\" \"Yes, I am all you say\u2014Faith, Confidence, Power, Ambition, and more. For greater than all is 'That Something.' I am that which every man must find in his soul or else he will be but a clutterer of the earth on which he lives.\" \"But how can man find you?\" \"Even as you are finding me now. First you must awaken, then seek, and when you have found you must learn to control . . .\" \"Control . . . borrow it from your soul and baptize your life with it. Anoint your eyes, that you may see; anoint your ears, that you may hear; anoint your heart, that you may be!\" \"But tell me,\" I cried frantically, for the voice was trailing off to almost nothing, \"how can I do this? How? How?\" \"This is the secret,\" came the voice to me as the whisper of a gentle breeze, \"these words\u2014'I will.' \"160 h i s t o r y r e p e at s 237 \"The Story of That Something\" is the first chapter of The Bigness of the Fellow Within, and presumably he meant the essay to be recognized as important. What is harder to know is whether he thought his readers would notice the discrepancy in authorship, and that the chapter was an abridgement of a short book actually entitled That Something, by William Witherspoon Woodbridge, which was first published in 1915. B. J. adapted the text by embedding himself in the narrative, and embellishing it with details about his own childhood in eastern Iowa. It is striking that in a work most intended to express his inner life, B. J. Palmer chose to confabulate his own story with others, concealing their identities and also hiding his own. He seems driven not by what he thought, but by what he wanted others to believe of him. As he channeled the Metaphysical ideas of other people, it is as if the terrain of his own character was eroded by the flood of outside sources. I believe B. J. wanted everything he presented to be accepted as true, though his wry sense of humor suggests he anticipated others' skepticism. I also think his stories became affectively true for him. Asking whether B. J. was a calculating knave or a foolish madman is a variant to a question that bedevils philosophers: whether humans do bad things out of malice or ignorance. I used to think of these as opposing qualities, and have come to see them as mutually reinforcing; self-deception facilitates the manipulation of others.161 The psychologists who have given it the most attention seem to regard fantasy-oriented thinking as a naturally-occurring trait, seemingly hardwired into people's temperaments.162 Perhaps what is most unique about B. J. is his extreme interweaving of originality and imitation. I think one of B. J.'s chief defenses was his self-understanding as an \"outsider.\" Consider how he describes himself in the biographical preface to The Bigness of the Fellow Within: \"He began to know what it was to face a hostile, belligerent, prejudiced home town folk. They considered him a fake, fraud, mountebank, a grafter on sick people. He was socially, commercially, professionally, and financially ignored by everybody. . . . The struggle to be recognized as a man amongst men, as a business man amongst business men; to be accepted as a financial pillar bringing millions of foreign dollars into his home town every year; to be accepted socially in society; to be looked up to as worthy and well qualified in secret organizations\u2014all this was denied him and constituted a bitter struggle of thirty years he had to go through.\"163 B. J.'s personal anxiety captured the class resentment of his profession\u2014perhaps cartoonish to outsiders, but iconic for the people whose sentiments it echoed. Were I granted access to B. J.'s inner life, or D. D.'s for that matter, I think I would find each Palmer's sense of self was formed through opposition to 238 h i s t o r y r e p e at s conventional wisdom and the norms of polite society. Clearly, B. J. and D. D. were immune to many social protocols. Their oddness was both natural and cultivated, reflecting both a canny understanding of human relations and a lack of empathy. The Palmers found \"meaning\" and psychic confirmation not with community but in imagined opposition to it. Their acts of antagonism show this. So too does their writing; \"individualism\" is a quality they both accorded the highest value. Spiritual autodidacts with vibrant curiosities and no systematic training, D. D. and B. J. Palmer were poorly equipped to accept the intellectual checks and balances that come with collaborative work, or the compromises required in the building of lasting institutions. The force of the Palmers' beliefs reveal them to be dogmatic anti-dogmatists. Their experiences suggest that the extreme freedom available to religious innovators can ultimately limit charismatic authority, by impeding attempts at necessary cooperation. Their obstinate independence of thought makes it tempting to discount the Palmers as cranks, but that would be to misunderstand something important about American religious life: the astonishing prevalence of such ventures. As a result, it may be useful for scholars to consider the presence of other \"dogmatic anti-dogmatists\" on the American religious landscape. When he led the school, B. J. spread his intellectual persona around the Palmer campus by having most of the walls painted with epigrams. The back stairway of the B. J. Palmer Clinic building, for example, carried the quotes \"Life Is the Great Adventure,\" and \"Every Day Brings Some New Interesting Experience.\"164 Other walls bore statements like \"It takes 72 Muscles to Frown and Only 14 to Smile. Why Not Smile?\" Today, many of these aphorisms are painted over, though some, like the \"smile\" epigram, remain. The walls proffer a visual coherence perhaps absent in B. J.'s lifetime, but comparison with photos of the campus from forty years ago also provokes a sense of loss. A few coats of paint cannot eradicate the actuality of B. J.'s lasting influence. The outgrowth of his religious thought coincided with the matriculation at Palmer of several students who later became leaders in the Straight chiropractic movement, including Fred H. Barge, James W. Parker, Thom Gelardi, Reggie Gold, and Sid E. Williams. Into the present day, such individuals have vigorously promoted ideas that remain fairly close to B. J.'s version of Chiropractic Philosophy. Interestingly, it is not simply the content of their work that resembles that of their teacher. They often seek to recreate B. J.'s literary style, through the use of epigrams and long quotations from the Palmers and other chiropractic authorities. Furthermore, like B. J., Straight chiropractors seem to understand themselves as participants in a project of cosmic h i s t o r y r e p e at s 239 proportions\u2014that of communicating fundamental knowledge about the nature of reality. A comment from Sid Williams, founder of Life Chiropractic University in Marietta, Georgia, reflects the unbound confidence of Straight chiropractic, as well as the ethic of dissent that persists in this branch of the profession: \"Those of us who sat at the feet of Dr. B. J. Palmer and became willing to spread the uncompromising truth of chiropractic were frequently castigated for our recognition and emphasis of cause, and of Universal Intelligence, which was often branded as a religious concept. . . . Chiropractic has joined the ranks of the truly great sciences with its recognition of that which gives vivication to all creation.\"165 shall chiropractic survive? One of the last books B. J. wrote was called Shall Chiropractic Survive? At the time, the question worried many in the chiropractic profession. Though legalized, its numbers were falling, largely as a result of basic-science barriers. From a high of about 30,000 chiropractors in the early 1930s, the profession had lost at least a third of its membership by the time of B. J.'s death.166 Through the middle decades of the twentieth century, the AMA continued its public relations campaign against chiropractic, questioning the safety and scientific legitimacy of the practice. Physicians who belonged to the AMA were barred from cooperating professionally with chiropractors and could not make referrals for chiropractic treatment, nor could they take any steps toward granting chiropractors hospital privileges. In a quest for survival, chiropractors advertised, and used sales promotions most physicians would disdain. Away from the public, however, chiropractors took to self-reflection, and the confidence building that could fortify them for the self-promotion critical to success. The simultaneous promises of stronger external presentation and inner power are characteristic of positive thinking business philosophy. The early 1950s saw the emergence of a venture that would distinguish the profession, with mixed consequences.167 \"Practice-building seminars\" describe workshops, symposia, and conferences held by and for chiropractors. They are an important aspect of the chiropractic movement, offering chances for chiropractors to learn new strategies for office management and increasing income. At the same time, the seminars reinforced public impressions of chiropractic as a business and not a healing modality, and further strained relations with the medical profession. James Parker is credited with launching the first practice-building seminars in the early 1950s, but the overlap between chiropractic and prosperity 240 h i s t o r y r e p e at s philosophies starts in many ways with B. J.'s own ventures. B. J. was a regular speaker at Rotary, Kiwanis, and other social clubs, where succeeding in business was one of his main topics. B. J. was the ideal-typical Positive Thinker, stressing distinctiveness and individuality. He clearly felt it was more important to be noticed than taken fully seriously, though he wanted the latter, too. The Palmer Homecoming Lyceums presage the conferences and training seminars now prominent in both chiropractic and New Age culture. A populist booster with work experience on the vaudeville circuit, B. J. deliberately modeled his \"Lyceums\" on the Chautauqua programs of the Progressive Era. The \"Homecoming\" reunions held on an annual basis made Davenport a pilgrimage site, but more importantly they established a ritual format in the profession for public lectures. An important connection illustrates the social networks that have sustained ties between chiropractic and motivational success philosophy. Napoleon Hill was one of the best-known motivational speakers of the twentieth century; his book Think and Grow Rich has sold tens of millions of copies. But Hill was years away from his later celebrity when he agreed to speak at the 1921 Lyceum in Davenport. The visit gave Hill, then a man in his early twenties, the chance to spend time with B. J. So began a lifelong friendship. B. J. became Hill's personal chiropractor, and the Palmer School advertised in Hill's Golden Rule magazine, in which Hill credited B. J. as an influential mentor. In Selling Yourself, B. J. presented Hill as exemplary of the correct attitude in business. Hill had eschewed the speaker's fee for participating in the 1921 Lyceum, and was rewarded when many (perhaps most) of the chiropractors in attendance chose to purchase subscriptions to his magazine. But other reports of this friendship-based transaction also exist, and point to a symbiosis not fully based in altruism. The Journal of the American Medical Association reported that Hill had begun advertising his intent to make a film entitled Intolerance about the martyrdom of California chiropractors who \"went to jail for chiro.\" In the Golden Rule, Hill promised to allocate $1 of every $3 subscription to the movie fund. He recommended chiropractors subscribe and also advertise the serial to their patients.168 When the Parker seminars launched, B. J. was in the process of winding down. Mostly retired from public life, he had in fact moved from Davenport to Sarasota, Florida. James W. Parker had graduated from Palmer in 1946. He then moved to Texas and became a pioneer in the chiropractic franchise model. By 1950 Parker had seventeen clinics in operation in and around Dallas, Waco, and Meridian. h i s t o r y r e p e at s 241 James Parker authored the Textbook of Office Procedure and Practice Building for the Chiropractic Profession in 1951. Like D. D. Palmer decades earlier, Parker believed a vibratory principle mediated events in the universe. He communicated this philosophy through a set of \"Laws of the Universe.\" And Parker's list of Affirming Principles were expressed in a popular vernacular worthy of the Palmers' own admiration: \"1. Image plus Action equals Feeling. . . 2. You attract to your life your feelings. . . 6. Nature will give you what you act like you already got. . . 7. To become, act as if. . . 9. Success is pre-determined by your Faith, Confidence and Belief.\"169 The Textbook of Office Procedure and Practice Building for the Chiropractic Profession went through many editions, expanding the practical advice offered, but carrying a consistent message tying Straight chiropractic to American Metaphysical philosophy. At the same time, the book contained a great deal of practical advice. It instructed chiropractors to establish empathy with their patients, described as \"CREATING DESIRE by using PATHIE.\" The book also included detachable forms one could duplicate for use in one's own practice, including templates for a health evaluation questionnaire, a confidential patient case history, lists of intake questions, and even a suggested established fee schedule. Two years later, Parker launched a campaign of chiropractic promotion, with the ambitious name, \"Crusade of 1953.\" This led to the creation of the Parker School for Professional Success in 1958. The Parker College of Chiropractic was chartered in 1978, and operates today as a health-sciences college known as Parker University, in Dallas-Fort Worth. Practice-building seminars imparted a coherent \"occupational self\" for chiropractors\u2014reinforcing their self-perceptions as science-based clinicians, knowledgeable healers, and successful businesspeople.170 Still popular today, the Parker seminars became a model in and beyond the chiropractic movement. Consulting firms, chiropractic associations, and individual chiropractic entrepreneurs now all organize seminars. I have wondered whether all 60,000 chiropractors currently practicing in the United States attend or organize such seminars. Actually, almost every American chiropractor attends at least one professional seminar over the course of a career. Not all chiropractors subscribe to vibrational theory, but the social arguments made by chiropractic also predispose the profession to an elective affinity with positive thinking. Donald Meyer has shown how the \"self\" stressed in positive thinking was intended to appeal to the \"white collar proletariat.\" To the extent that positive thinking is, as Meyer proposed, a \"tactic of adjustment\" to the corporate order, it should not surprise that chiropractors have welcomed this philosophy.171 To be blunt, \"believe in yourself\" confirms identity when society won't. 242 h i s t o r y r e p e at s The concepts in positive thinking are ones nearly all chiropractors would recognize. The logic of positive thinking rests on the arguments of Neoplatonic idealism: the mutability of matter, energy, and spirit. It assumes that human and cosmic consciousness are coextensive, and posits that for this reason, correct thought is constitutive of reality. One sees this theme in the axiom, \"Thought are Things,\" but a spectrum of possibilities stands behind this common phrase. New Thought beliefs exist along a continuum, from self-confidence and general optimism through \"magical thinking.\" A critical variable is how one interprets the \"Law of Attraction,\" an idea that dates to the early twentieth century but has been popularized more recently in The Secret. The Law of Attraction connects human brains, understanding thoughts as magnetic impulses traveling through the ether. These impulses can reach another thinker's thoughts, but they also are believed to affect material reality by changing the vibrational qualities of physical matter. The Law of Attraction emerged from the same cultural milieu as early chiropractic. In the work of Napoleon Hill, William Atkinson, and other Metaphysical writers, one finds ideas from vital magnetism, psychometry, and ether theories\u2014all the projects that engaged D. D. Palmer. For these writers, negative emotions and states of existence like poverty and despair\u2014as well as positive states such as health, wealth, and prosperity\u2014all operate on principles of vibration and attraction. Here, thinking correct thoughts is not just a matter of \"thinking with the mind of God\"\u2014it means attuning one's mind to the vibrations of the ether, so as to affect material reality. Confidence-building and professional cohesion aside, it is unlikely the practice-building seminars would be so highly patronized if they did not offer tangible benefits for participants, in the form of business advice. Professional seminars are, however, also profitable endeavors for their organizers. Within a few years of starting up, the Parker seminars had many imitators. One of the first competitors was a former instructor from Palmer College. William M. Harris was running the Kentuckiana Chiropractic Children's Center in Louisville when he launched his own program of seminars in 1960.172 Among the first speakers he engaged was Napoleon Hill. The success of the practice-building model has had mixed effects for the profession. While it provides a sense of cohesion, this has come at the cost of public perceptions. The emphasis on business undercuts the idea that chiropractic is analogous to regular medicine, and the medical anthropologist Hans Baer has identified practice-building seminars as one of the main reasons chiropractic is in conflict with regular medicine.173 h i s t o r y r e p e at s 243 In the 1950s, the efforts of the AMA to portray chiropractic as a deviant pseudoscience were largely successful. Although chiropractic had a committed following in terms of clientele, enthusiasts were a subculture in the American population. Much of the lay public remained skeptical about the practice. To many Americans, the chiropractic profession was best represented in the character of the recovering alcoholic Doc Delaney in William Inge's popular play, Come Back, Little Sheba. A dropout from medical school, Doc puts on a cheerful front for his patients, but he cannot evade the truth that his life has been a crushing failure. He is a fraud, a \"wannabe doctor.\" Burt Lancaster played Doc in the 1952 film, which earned an Academy Award for Shirley Booth's performance, but the screen adaptation did little to burnish public impressions of chiropractors. Rather, the decade of the 1950s stands as an apex of cultural authority for professional medicine. The image of doctors started to decline in the 1960s, partly as a result of their successful representation as scientists. Countercultural reactions to the military-industrial complex extended to other symbols of scientific authority, such as medicine. Soon after, as the cost of health care increased, so too did suspicion and resentment of American medicine. Popular culture indicted physicians for their callous bedside manners, and contributed to a framing of modern health care as overly technological. More than just dehumanizing, modern medicine was seen as inimical to the \"natural,\" \"spiritual\" dimensions of treatment that are humanity's birthright. Chiropractors were able to draft on the winds of this change, as a variety of developments favored their rising status. The profession began to seek to counter negative stereotypes more aggressively. These efforts were helped in 1955, when a pulp-fiction writer named Thorp McClusky wrote a favorable article for True, The Man's Magazine.174 McClusky's piece was well-received at Palmer College and the International Chiropractors Association, and especially among a select group of chiropractors based in New York who were hoping to improve public perceptions of the profession. They encouraged McClusky to pursue his interest more deeply, and offered their help for his research. The release of Your Health and Chiropractic in 1957 marked the first major publication about chiropractic that was relatively nonpartisan: neither written by a chiropractor nor an expose.175 The chiropractors who had encouraged McClusky hoped it would reintroduce the America public to the profession. McClusky's work was followed by another book aimed at a general readership: Chiropractic: A Modern Way to Health by Julius Dintenfass came out in 1962.176 By all appearances, the profession was determined to take its message more directly to the American people. 244 h i s t o r y r e p e at s After his father's death, Dave Palmer sought to distance the college from B. J.'s leadership in both real and symbolic ways.177 The Palmer School was renamed Palmer College of Chiropractic, and sought nonprofit status. Dave quietly sold off the odder items in B. J.'s collections, including the phallic art. In 1970 Dave formed the Association of Chiropractic Colleges with other Straight chiropractic leaders. This group sought to become the national accrediting agency for chiropractic schools. The effort failed in 1974 when the U.S. Office of Education recognized the Council on Chiropractic Education instead. In the wake of that decision, Dave instructed Palmer College administrators to apply for accreditation from the CCE. Loyal to Straight chiropractic but realistic about the direction in which the profession was heading, Dave sought to make Palmer College part of the chiropractic \"mainstream,\" even if that meant cooperating with longstanding rivals. chiropractic speaks out Physicians may have foreseen that chiropractic would soften its sectarian identity. In 1957 the AMA introduced a rule into its code of ethics that barred their member doctors from making referrals to chiropractors, officializing a policy that had been practiced for decades. Through the 1960s, the AMA attempted to undermine cooperation between the professions, and in 1963 created a new \"Committee on Quackery\" that specifically targeted chiropractors.178 The AMA's campaign against chiropractors was fed by paradoxical concerns about the profession: that chiropractic was illegitimate, and that it wasn't. Developments such as becoming nonprofit or adjusting curricula in light of basic-science exams were bringing chiropractic closer to the norms of American health professions, and held out the promise of greater credibility. Chiropractors won important legal victories in spite of AMA opposition. The profession finally saw an end to the struggle for legal recognition at the state level, when in 1974, Louisiana became the last state to pass a chiropractic licensure law. That same year, Florida became the first state to repeal its basic science laws, returning control of educational standards to the chiropractic profession. Furthermore, in 1974 the U.S. Office of Education recognized the CCE as a legitimate accrediting body for chiropractic colleges.179 With state acceptance in place, chiropractors turned their attention to winning Federal recognition. In 1973 the U.S. Congress voted to include chiropractic care under the Medicare health program.180 In the following years, Medicaid and Worker's Compensation also began to pay for the treatment. The U.S. military started commissioning chiropractors as health care providers in 1992. Ten h i s t o r y r e p e at s 245 years later, Congress voted to make chiropractic treatment available to both active members of the armed forces and veterans, the latter through the Veterans Administration healthcare system. Bringing money and legitimacy, the inclusion of chiropractic in Great Society and later government programs was a huge development. It reflected both chiropractors' attainment of political acumen and Americans' use of and support for the practice. Chiropractors' efforts to organize were visibly paying off. The trend to increase coverage for chiropractic has continued, so that today the treatment is included in most American health insurance plans. The acceptance of chiropractic into American health care was abetted by increased dialogue between some medical doctors and chiropractors. In 1975, the National Institutes of Health held a workshop on spinal manipulative therapy (SMT). A year later, the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare published the papers and commentaries from the meeting. Chiropractors welcomed the report, \"The Research Status of Spinal Manipulative Therapy,\" as critical evidence of the efficacy of their practice.181 Additional research came out of a 1978 conference on spinal treatment held in New Zealand. The 1979 report by the New Zealand Commission of Inquiry found spinal manipulation to be an effective therapy, and chiropractors to be the optimal providers. Furthermore, the New Zealand report asserted that much of the criticism against the practice was politically motivated, and recommended that physicians and chiropractors cooperate without legal or professional barriers. By the 1970s, chiropractors felt ready to go after a long-time nemesis. In 1973 Chester A. Wilk authored a manifesto, entitled Chiropractic Speaks Out.182 Three years later, the Park Ridge, Illinois chiropractor led a team of his colleagues in filing an antitrust suit against the American Medical Association. The plaintiffs argued that the AMA had restricted chiropractors' legal business practices.183 The case became the greatest legal standoff between the chiropractic and medical professions. In June 1987, Seventh Circuit federal judge Susan Getzendanner ruled against the AMA. Judge Getzendanner focused on the organized campaign the AMA had run against the chiropractic profession, which was a violation of antitrust law through the Sherman Act.184 In 1990, the decision was upheld by both the U.S. Court of Appeals and also the Supreme Court. For chiropractors, the medical profession was deemed the monopoly they always had felt it to be. Wilk drove this point home with the title of his next book, Medicine, Monopolies and Malice, released in 1995.185 The NIH and New Zealand reports were cited as evidence in Wilk v. AMA, but none of the court opinions addressed the issue of chiropractic efficacy, 246 h i s t o r y r e p e at s only questions regarding \"restraint of trade.\" Even so, the final dispensation of Wilk v. AMA was a watershed moment for chiropractic. The AMA effectively ended its public relations campaign against the profession. While some physicians and chiropractors remained highly suspicious of each other, the threat of legal injunction meant that these sentiments were less likely to be aired before a lay audience. At the same time, the decision needs to be understood as the decriminalization of a comity between chiropractors and physicians that some really did want, and were already practicing. On the ground, much of the interaction between these professions had become characterized by mutual respect and cooperation in the treatment of patients who used both modalities. The Wilk decision arrived at the perfect moment for chiropractic. Interest in alternative medicine surged in the 1980s and 1990s. Resentment against an overly corporate, impersonal medical establishment had fueled a cultural backlash, captured in books like Medicine on Trial.186 The rising interest in alternative medicine was officially noted in two highly publicized research studies. A 1993 survey led by David Eisenberg of Harvard Medical School found that more than one-third of the respondents had used a form of alternative or complementary treatment over the previous year. A follow-up study five years later raised the figure to more than 40 percent.187 The Eisenberg studies forced all stakeholders to recognize the tremendous role of alternative treatments in Americans' healthcare behavior. Since publication the Eisenberg studies have been criticized over issues of population sampling and their expansive definition of \"alternative medicine,\" which included both visits to alternative practitioners and self-treatment with herbal remedies and over-the-counter vitamins. At the time, the impression created by the studies that a third of Americans were patronizing \"other healers\" seems in itself to have increased Americans' use of alternative treatments. It definitely inspired an influx of research money for the scientific study of complementary therapies. Federal support for chiropractic research grew with the establishment in 1998 of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) at the National Institutes of Health. That year, the NIH provided a $2.5 million grant to fund the Consortial Center of Chiropractic Research (CCCR) at Palmer College, and the Cochrane Collaboration, an international network of healthcare researchers, established a working group to study back pain. By dampening attacks from the AMA against alternative treatments, Wilk vs. AMA brought a measure of protection for many types of practitioners, and had the unexpected effect of creating new competition for chiropractic. In 1994, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued an h i s t o r y r e p e at s 247 Operational Policy Letter that allowed but did not require reimbursement for Chiropractic under Medicare, and which also permitted reimbursement for spinal manipulation done by other types of practitioners. The American Chiropractic Association filed a lawsuit in 1998, which was dismissed in a summary judgment six years later.188 The persistence of Chiropractic Philosophy needs to be understood in this context. The \"mainstreaming\" of alternative medicine has affected how proponents understand and describe their practices.189 At the same time, for chiropractic, mainstreaming seems to have given chiropractors new confidence to talk about the spiritual dimensions of the profession, and also reactivated ambivalence about this. a s p l e n d i d h e r i ta g e The Palmers are figures many in the present-day profession would like to forget, but their exaggerated biographies hold a clue to the temperament of the profession. Many chiropractors have been, like the Palmers, antiauthoritarian in epistemology and combinative with information. They, too, were bricoleurs, not beholden doctrinally or institutionally to their individual sources. Once loosened from B. J.'s domination, they were predisposed to launch their own creative expressions. Perhaps this is why the interpersonal dynamics revealed in the Palmers' relationships seem to characterize much so much of the chiropractic movement. It is useful to consider the fate of another chiropractic \"maverick\": Sid E. Williams, founder of Life Chiropractic University in Marietta, Georgia.190 Williams, born in 1928, played football at Georgia Tech from 1949 to 1951. After graduation, he and his wife Nell Williams studied chiropractic at Palmer, where they became interested in B. J.'s Metaphysics. After opening more than a dozen chiropractic clinics in the South, the Williamses founded Life Chiropractic College in 1974. Known as a \"Super Straight,\" Sid Williams was a charismatic figure, deeply rooted in the human potential movement. He ran Life College with a flamboyance to match that of B. J. Palmer, and his self-promotion worked. By the 1990s, enrollment at the newly renamed Life Chiropractic University (LCU) had grown to 4,000 students, making it the largest chiropractic college in the United States at the time. Williams promoted Homecoming and \"Jubilee\" celebrations very much in the spirit of B. J. Palmer. Moreover, he resembled B. J. in his faults as well as his talents. He was known as an autocratic leader, even while LCU was supposed to operate under the governance of an independent board. Despite its 248 h i s t o r y r e p e at s incorporation as a nonprofit, LCU functioned like a proprietary institute. By 2001 it was evident that Williams's lifestyle was threatening the tax-exempt status of the school, and enrollment was falling.191 In 2002 both the CCE and the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools revoked the accreditation of Life Chiropractic University. More than fifty \"areas for improvement\" were cited, but Williams's governance and executive compensation were main causes of concern. The CCE also questioned whether LCU students were being properly trained to spot illnesses that were unlikely to benefit from chiropractic treatment, such as diabetes. The loss of accreditation meant that LCU graduates could not sit for state chiropractic exams. Facing the threat of lawsuits from angry students, Sid Williams was forced by his board to resign. Soon thereafter, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools restored accreditation, but it was not until 2005 that the CCE reaccepted LCU as an accredited member in good standing. After leaving LCU, Sid Williams promoted his \"Dynamic Essentials Program\" through conferences modeled on the Parker seminars. In Marietta, he was replaced by another Straight leader, Guy Riekeman, a former president of Palmer College of Chiropractic. Williams's rise and fall echoes the alienation from the chiropractic movement experienced by the Palmers, and shows how the profession can recapitulate the interpersonal dynamics of its earliest history. From the beginning, chiropractic has thrived thanks significantly to the efforts of creative individualists, but many of these figures have been prone to an authoritarianism that undermines their efforts to build institutions. This phenomenon is not limited to chiropractic: American alternative religions are so crackled with breaks between founders and close \"disciples\" that fragmentation seems to be a defining trait, the hobgoblin of Spiritual Religion. When Dave Palmer died in 1978, Galen R. Price was named president of Palmer College.192 The choice was meaningful: Price had held numerous administrative positions, but more importantly, for 38 years he was head of the Philosophy Department. In fact, Price had taken over that office from Ralph W. Stephenson, to whose authoritative text Chiropractic Philosophy Price contributed an additional chapter in revised editions.193 His appointment to the presidency could be read as an affirmation of the ideas of the Palmer family, especially D. D. and B. J. If so, then it is ironic his tenure as president lasted only one year. Price was succeeded by Jerome F. McAndrews, who served from 1979 to 1987. While McAndrews was president, Palmer College acquired a sibling school in California. In 1980 the Northern California College of Chiropractic was renamed Palmer College of Chiropractic West. The school earned full h i s t o r y r e p e at s 249 accreditation from the CCE in 1985. McAndrews had a remarkably ecumenical career in chiropractic, serving as a national media spokesperson for the ACA, and also as director of the ICA. Jerome McAndrews was followed in 1988 by Donald P. Kern. As a member of the class of 1958, Donald Kern had studied at Palmer while B. J. was still living, but he was foremost a faculty clinician and not a chiropractic philosopher.194 In addition to serving as a college administrator, Kern had been director of the chiropractic clinic and chairman of the Technique Department. In 1991, during Kern's tenure as president, the Palmer Chiropractic University System was formed from Palmer College and Palmer College of Chiropractic West. Dave Palmer's granddaughter, Vickie Palmer, was named chairman of the Board of Trustees. In 1994 Kern returned to teaching chiropractic technique full-time, and Virgil V. Strang was appointed president. Strang was the author of Essential Principles of Chiropractic: Philosophy, which is considered the successor to Stephenson's Chiropractic Textbook.195 Virgil Strang was an especially beloved figure on the Davenport Campus. In April 1998, he made public his intent to retire that November. That August the board of trustees approved Guy F. Riekeman to replace him, but Strang died before formally stepping down. Riekeman was formally installed on schedule that December. A 1972 Palmer graduate, Riekeman had returned to his alma mater in 1997 to direct the Palmer Institute for Professional Advancement. His ascension to the presidency was to some extent a reaffirmation of Straight Chiropractic Philosophy at Davenport. Previously, Riekeman was affiliated with the Sherman College of Chiropractic in Spartanburg, South Carolina. There, as dean of philosophy and vice president, he played an influential role in the growth of the school. Alongside Chiropractic Philosophy, however, Riekeman's selection for president depended heavily on the public image he brought to Palmer. By the 1990s, Guy Riekeman was a nationally known promoter of chiropractic, both to members of his profession and the general public.196 He created several motivational seminars, including Quest Alliance and the Chiropractic Leadership Alliance. Riekeman had studied film at UCLA and he produced several films about his profession. Across several venues Riekeman communicated an \"extroverted\" version of chiropractic. He presented it as a system of \"total wellness\" which had broad applicability and deserved a rightful place in the American healthcare system. Riekeman assumed the presidency at a time when concerns ran high at Palmer about the declining student body. Riekeman presided over a stabilization of the enrollment at the Davenport campus and the creation of a satellite school called Palmer College of Chiropractic Florida. In 2003, he was named 250 h i s t o r y r e p e at s chancellor of the Palmer Chiropractic University System. These accomplishments supported Riekeman's image as a \"visionary,\" but his administration also courted a set of problems. Riekeman was known as a \"cost-cutter\" who oversaw the enforcement of unpopular financial decisions at Palmer, but he became what was then one of the most highly-paid college presidents in America. Some faculty were concerned about priorities in the curriculum, others about the \"management seminars\" Riekeman promoted. He also was known to have a strained relationship with his board, under whose pressure he resigned in February 2004. Within weeks of stepping down as president of Palmer, Riekeman assumed his current position as president of LCU. Riekeman's departure was divisive; Palmer students and faculty felt strongly on both sides of the issue. Leadership of the Palmer Chiropractic University System was reorganized. For the second time, Donald Kern became president of Palmer College of Chiropractic in Davenport, and Peter Martin, who had been president of Palmer West, also took over leadership the Florida school. Donald Kern sought unity in the chiropractic world and called for an end to factionalism. Hoping that Palmer College would represent a moderate chiropractic majority, he wrote, \"One of our greatest strengths is the appropriate balance of philosophy, science and art in our curriculum, as embraced by the Palmer Tenets and the Palmer Educational Principles. Palmer College of Chiropractic stands squarely in the middle of mainstream chiropractic, and our students are assured of getting a balanced chiropractic education.\"197 Statements like this one led some Straight chiropractors to view Kern as an advocate of medical chiropractic. They read a narrative of medical conquest into his return to the Palmer presidency.198 This impression is supported by the direction the trustees have taken since Donald Kern's retirement in 2010. Kern was replaced by Dennis M. Marchiori, who had been serving as vice chancellor for academics and once had been the chair of the radiology department on the Davenport campus. In an inaugural interview with the Quad City Times, Marchiori stated his commitment to transparency in governance, evidence-based chiropractic, and cultural change for the institution.199 Significantly, Marchiori was appointed not as a college president, but as chancellor of the board of trustees. While the Florida and California branches of Palmer University are managed by presidents, the main campus in Davenport now is managed by several vice-chancellors, with oversight from the trustees. Like their predecessors many current board members are Palmer graduates, but the current vice chancellor for research and health policy, Christine Goertz, holds a PhD from the University of Minnesota and once worked as a program h i s t o r y r e p e at s 251 officer at National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine at the NIH.200 The accommodation to medical perspectives appears to be paying off. The Palmer University system currently graduates about one in five chiropractors.201 At the moment, the medical perspective is ascendant at Palmer College, but it may be too soon for either side to call victory. 252 h i s t o r y r e p e at s chapter seven the world of chiropractic Chiropractic is Thoroughly American. \u2014D. D. Palmer, The Science of Chiropractic (1906), 3 chiropractic ascendance and headwinds In 1970 the profession stood at a perilously low 13,000 chiropractors, but within twenty years, that number more than tripled. Not only is chiropractic more accepted now than at any previous point in its history, it is perhaps better positioned than any other alternative healing system to emerge over the past 200 years. Chiropractors are the best-compensated practitioners of alternative and complementary medicine. Few critics wage vendettas against the profession. Untrammeled by such detractors, chiropractic has to a great extent succeeded in presenting itself as part of American \"mainstream\" healthcare. That said, the economic and cultural achievements of the profession are by no means entirely secure. Chiropractic still faces questions about both its effectiveness and the core tenets of its theory. Notwithstanding several high profile studies in the 1970s, outside research on chiropractic has been a mixed blessing. Chiropractic, like alternative medicine in general, is today under special pressure as a result of the 1990s research largesse. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine was established with great hope for cooperation and mutual respect between physicians and alternative practitioners, but many studies have returned mixed or negative evaluations of complementary therapies. In a 2003 meta-analysis published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, a team of researchers found spinal manipulation to have no benefits over other conventional treatments for back pain, and minimal effectiveness over placebos.1 Since then, other studies have found different levels of evidence. 253 This was noted in a systematic review released in 2014, whose main conclusion was that too few studies on the efficacy of chiropractic met research standards.2 Researchers unaffiliated with chiropractic still question the very existence of spinal subluxation, to say nothing of its causal role in illness. In March 2006 the British Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine reported that a review of two dozen recent studies of spinal manipulation from the last five years found the treatment minimally effective in ameliorating back pain, and of no help for conditions like asthma, allergies, or menstrual pain.3 Some of the most discrediting assessments have come from the Cochrane Collaboration, which is based in the United Kingdom. The Cochrane reviews determined chiropractic to be of little or no benefit for nonspinal conditions such as menstrual disorders and asthma.4 What is more, chiropractic and other forms of spinal manipulative therapy earned mixed evaluations for efficacy in treating lower back pain. The Cochrane reviewers found spinal manipulation to be modestly effective in pain management\u2014but no better than other treatments, including analgesics, exercise, physical therapy, and care by a general practitioner.5 Interestingly, one set of Cochrane reviewers found a modest pain relief from touch therapies, including Reiki and therapeutic touch, though their study noted a strong placebo effect that could not be distilled.6 Chiropractic is now believed to have a poor track record for healing structural damage to the spine. Rather, the treatment seems to be most effective for self-remitting conditions, like most cases of lower back pain. At the outset of this book, I promised readers that they were likely to feel better after a chiropractic adjustment. It may interest them to know that regardless of treatment, most back conditions resolve themselves within thirty days. Chiropractic treatment may actually be a form of \"condition management,\" whose real benefit is helping patients wait out the natural healing process. Such an assessment is not too different from what chiropractors claim to be doing. A minimally invasive touch-based therapy administered in time of acute pain may affect the body's overall stress response and improve subjective well-being: in this respect, chiropractic is true to its claim that \"it works.\"7 Focusing solely on physical effectiveness overlooks the dimension where chiropractic really does seem to have an edge. An ironic side benefit of the market orientation of the profession is its commitment to patient satisfaction. It is usually easy to schedule a chiropractic appointment, and many clinics take walk-in patients. Initial intake visits include more time with the practitioner than most medical appointments (though follow-up visits to chiropractors 254 t h e w o r l d o f c h i r o p r a c t i c can be very perfunctory, especially when a clinic is busy). Regardless of appointment duration, contact with patients in between appointments is steadier. Furthermore, patients who use chiropractic for \"maintenance treatments\" or \"wellness visits\" are usually offered discounts, sliding scales, and flexible payment plans for the cost of treatment. These differences translate to an easier patient experience that helps account for both the commercial and therapeutic success of chiropractic. The embrace of marketing has not shielded chiropractic from market forces. It is very difficult to obtain accurate data on the chiropractic profession. Most chiropractors are self-employed, and how they list their occupational information may affect their survey responses. Setting aside these disclaimers, the profession seems to have experienced a \"bubble\" after Wilk vs. AMA. The number of chiropractors grew very quickly in the years immediately following the Supreme Court decision, to 50,000 by 1994. It seems to have hit high water in the late 1990s, when stakeholders began to cite a membership figure of 60,000 American chiropractors, and a concurrent figure of 6,000 practitioners in Canada.8 In 1996 a leading health journal predicted growth to 100,000 by 2010.9 In 2008, however, the Bureau of Labor Statistics found the profession had fallen to 49,000 licensed practitioners. The natural conclusion is that chiropractic felt the impact of the Great Recession. But if chiropractors jump out of the profession, some also may return. In 2010 the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported 52,000 chiropractors in America, and by 2014 the BLS number had climbed to 66,000.10 Quixotically, predictions that the profession's ranks are about to increase also have returned. Currently, one can find many forecasts on the internet that the U.S. chiropractic population is set to jump as early as 2020, but these pronouncements resemble the ones made two decades ago. Statistics on chiropractic education also have signaled trouble for the profession. Chiropractic colleges always have depended on the presence of tuition-paying students. From the time of the G.I. Bill on, federal loan money available through different programs has translated into growth and contraction of student bodies. In the 1990s when federal money was plentiful, chiropractic schools grew at what looks to have been an unnaturally high rate. With tighter scrutiny and less money available for student loans, growth in enrollment has fallen off. In 2001 an Atlanta Journal-Constitution article reported a national drop of 15 percent in chiropractic college enrollment after 1997.11 Assessments since then corroborate that enrollment at chiropractic colleges has fallen, though it is unclear by exactly how much. This may not be unfortunate. Chiropractors have higher default rates for student loans when t h e w o r l d o f c h i r o p r a c t i c 255 compared to medical doctors and members of other healthcare professions.12 The point to infer is that many chiropractors seem unable to make their loan payments. A chiropractor's prospects for success today are not unlike those faced by D. D. Palmer when he started out as a magnetic healer more than 120 years ago. A small number of practitioners build very successful practices, sometimes with offices in several locations. This core raises the average reported income to $66,000 a year, a respectable rate of compensation but one that still does not rival MD salaries. Most chiropractors are far less fortunate than the chiropractic \"superstars,\" and many scramble to make ends meet. Attrition is not something chiropractors discuss much publicly, but online discussion groups reveal the profession to be aware and concerned. The jobs ex-chiropractors take give a meaningful sense of scale to their hardship. I learned this from a former chiropractor who, after practicing for eighteen years, went on to manage a photocopy shop. He was glad for the job security, but in 2006, before the Great Recession, he was earning less than nine dollars an hour. While chiropractic is confronted with strong financial and scientific headwinds, one of the greatest challenges is the direct result of its success. The profession withstands rivals with trademarked systems that are extremely similar to chiropractic, like Concept Therapy, applied kinesiology, and craniosacral manipulation. Meanwhile, chiropractic prosperity has brought competition from other touch-based body-work systems such as massage, Rolfing, Reiki, Trager Approach, and therapeutic touch. Proponents of such systems have learned from the chiropractic story, and they too aspire for recognition as legitimate healthcare providers. Regular medicine has grown more interested in spinal manipulation, which many physicians would prefer to either appropriate for orthopedics or relegate to physical therapy. And on both the East and West Coasts, chiropractors face a growing rivalry with naturopaths, who perform chiropractic adjustments as part of the full scope of holistic medicine. Since the 1970s, naturopathy practitioners have gained licensure in seventeen states. In those states, naturopaths have become a direct competitor of chiropractic.13 As naturopaths have gained the abilities to prescribe medications and perform lab tests, they are an attractive compromise for people seeking alternative care. The survival of the chiropractic profession does not appear to be in question, but the quality of that survival will depend on whether and how chiropractors adapt to social change. Chiropractors see different possibilities under several treatment models.14 Should chiropractic focus on musculoskeletal pain, the area of health where it is most patronized and has the most established 256 t h e w o r l d o f c h i r o p r a c t i c record? For the profession to take this route means increased competition with medical practitioners, especially physical therapists. Should chiropractors seek to increase their rights to practice, as osteopaths and naturopaths have done? For Straights, expanding the holistic options available under chiropractic care\u2014making chiropractors \"general alternative practitioners\" would come at the cost of professional cohesion. Some chiropractors would like the right to prescribe medications, either for spinal problems or for all conditions. Prescription rights would go far to establish chiropractors as primary-care providers. Yet for chiropractors opposed to antibiotics or vaccines, such a change would be an unacceptable compromise. Despite the hope of some chiropractors to extend the scope of the profession, back pain is the main reason for patient visits, and relatively few patients become regular clients. In this context, chiropractic's Metaphysics are less likely to be the focus of discussion. For \"wellness patients\" who choose to make chiropractic their primary healthcare, spirituality seems to be an incentive. Yet there often are great discrepancies between how chiropractors understand their practice, and what they tell their patients. Because Straight chiropractic beliefs directly challenge the religious commitments of many potential patients, Candy Brown found that chiropractors only selectively reveal Chiropractic Philosophy, and most patients are not aware the practice has a Metaphysical dimension.15 Brown has rightfully raised the issue of \"informed consent\" in therapeutic encounters with patients whose own religious beliefs might prevent them from using a type of spiritual healing. Clearly, many questions surround the potential integration of a faith-based healing practice into an evidence-based medical system\u2014in a largely religious society like the United States, in which the separation of church and state has been a central feature of governance. At the same time, chiropractors' discretion need not be seen as sinister. Courtney Bender found that many, perhaps most, spiritual healers moderate the overtness of their personal theologies. As one \"spiritual yoga\" teacher remarked, \"I censor myself sometimes because I want to be as palatable as I can to everybody. I want to cast a wide net.\"16 The contemporary demographic profile of chiropractic reflects its cultural history and lays out more challenges for the future. Chiropractic emerged in the heartland. From Iowa it spread rapidly through the Midwest and West into areas that were burned over by the Fundamentalist-Modernist Controversy. Current membership figures for the Christian Chiropractors Association (5,000 strong) attest to the strength of conservative subcultures in the profession today. Nonetheless, the political orientations of chiropractic will probably change, as the coastal presence becomes a stronger counterweight to the inland, \"Red State\" profession. t h e w o r l d o f c h i r o p r a c t i c 257 The chiropractic profession still is disproportionately male; in 2000, less than 14 percent of practicing chiropractors were women. That year, however, women constituted 25 percent of students enrolled at chiropractic colleges. By 2011, women represented 18 percent of the profession.17 I believe the gender imbalance in chiropractic is likely to continue to decrease. The real prospects for participation by women will depend on ongoing high enrollment at chiropractic colleges and retention of graduates as practitioners. Attrition from the profession is hard to quantify, but a recent study of chiropractors in California has been received as a benchmark for the profession as a whole. The researchers considered the attrition rates for chiropractors licensed between 1970 and 1998. In the 1970s, 10 percent of chiropractors left the profession in their first ten years of practice. By the 1990s, the portion had risen to 25 percent, and has stayed in the range of 20 to 25 percent since 1998.18 The authors posited that market saturation would keep attrition rates high. How women will fare in this competitive environment is unclear. The racial profile of the profession has proved less pervious to change. In the United States, fewer than 2 percent of chiropractors are African American. In fact, chiropractic recently made a list published by The Atlantic of \"The 33 Whitest Jobs in America,\" with a rate of 91.4 percent.19 This disparity does not seem to be the result of any intentional exclusion by the chiropractic profession in the present day. Many chiropractic colleges are taking measures to respond to demographic changes, with offices of diversity and recruitment programs.20 But racial imbalance in the profession has affected the patronization of chiropractors. In the United States, subpopulations use alternative medicine at different rates, with white Americans exhibiting a greater rate of use than Latinos or African Americans.21 a pat h f o r t h e s t r a i g h t m o v e m e n t In the early 2000s, a chiropractor wrote to Solon Langworthy's surviving granddaughter, then a woman in her eighties, to ask permission to place a tombstone on his grave, which still had no marker. This overture was refused; his family felt Langworthy still was not to be honored in death. With the help of archivists and chiropractic historians, his monument ultimately was placed outside the library at Palmer College, symbolically resolving the historic controversy between the founders of the Straight movement.22 258 t h e w o r l d o f c h i r o p r a c t i c In responding to cultural change, the profession must face questions about what it wishes to carry forward from its past. The Metaphysical heritage is a flashpoint in this debate. Straight-Mixer factionalism has the potential to complicate the unity needed to respond to economic and scientific challenges, tearing up the net of solidarity some chiropractors hope to weave. Mixers greatly outnumber Straights among chiropractors, comprising as much as four-fifths of the profession. Holistic chiropractors are well-positioned to dominate chiropractic, as a result of their engagement with alternative and complementary medicine. Mixer colleges are increasingly offering training in multiple modalities. The expansion to an array of therapies can be seen in changes to their names, such as the removal of the word \"chiropractic.\" National Chiropractic College is now National University of Health Sciences, and Western States Chiropractic College has become Western States University. Meanwhile, at Straight colleges like Palmer, many students appear more interested in receiving kinesiology or biomechanical training than in studying Metaphysical knowledge. Graduation from a Straight school does not prevent a student from adopting other practices. Professional affiliation is only a partial predictor of chiropractors' factional identification. The American Chiropractic Association is the larger of the two professional organizations for chiropractors in the United States, and the International Chiropractic Association is closer to the Straight end of the spectrum. Neither organization can be thought of as fully representing the majority of chiropractors, however. The International Chiropractic Association currently has 5,400 members; the American Chiropractic Association may hold 15,000. But together, the organizations represent less than half the chiropractors practicing in the United States. Furthermore, chiropractors of different persuasions join both groups for practical benefits such as group insurance, advocacy, and practice-building services. Other evidence argues for the potential strength of the Straight movement. Super Straight leaders like Sid Williams, Thom Gelardi, Reggie Gold, Joe Goldsmith, Guy Riekeman, and Terry Rondberg stand as prominent advocates for the profession.23 They have built both their own images and a separate Straight educational system with schools like Pennsylvania College of Straight Chiropractic (which closed in 1995); Sherman College of Chiropractic; and the previously discussed Life Chiropractic University. While most chiropractors understand the benefits of cooperation, some Super Straights still hope to build a separate infrastructure, through groups like the ADIO Institute of Straight Chiropractic; the World Chiropractic Alliance; the Federation of Straight Chiropractors and Organizations (now the t h e w o r l d o f c h i r o p r a c t i c 259 International Federation of Chiropractors and Organizations); and the shortlived Straight Chiropractic Academic Standards Association. It is also interesting to consider the weakness of the medical wing of the profession. The faction of chiropractors who reject the theory of subluxation is as much a minority as the Super Straights, and one of their larger representative bodies, the National Association for Chiropractic Medicine, disbanded at some point in the mid 2000s. For many chiropractors, the intricacies of Chiropractic Philosophy have only been a hurdle in the quest toward professional certification. Some members of the profession, however, see Chiropractic Philosophy as an ideology by which to demarcate their system from other forms of spinal-manipulative therapeutics. It reinforces the proprietary claims of the profession against other vertebral vitalist systems, marking it as a distinct type of healing. As Birgit Meyer notes, the communication of a religious message through mass media creates and maintains links between practitioners, but also connects them to a transcendental realm.24 Chiropractic Philosophy offers a rationale for increasing the therapeutic domain of the profession beyond the treatment of musculoskeletal problems. A recalibrated metaphysics allows the profession to make theoretical propositions that otherwise would be viewed as contradicting biomedicine. The goal of advancing chiropractic beyond back pain transcends the Straight movement. While there is no clear consensus as to how this should be done, many chiropractors are interested in restoring to their profession the status of a comprehensive form of healthcare. a v i ta l i s t r e s u r g e n c e Americans' social reactions to healthcare contain an array of concerns that go beyond the condition of the physical body. Any attempt to structure a system of healthcare delivery is likely to face attitudes and expectations based on cultural understandings. The chiropractic story points to the remarkable persistence of vitalist ideas across a long historical arc, and should make one cautious in expecting these ideas to disappear from American culture any time soon. Chiropractic owes much of its success to an enduring receptivity to its ideas among members of the American public for whom vitalism is an embedded cultural belief\u2014a social fact that affects their healthcare decisions. Beyond the Straight movement, many chiropractors are open to Metaphysical interpretations.25 Chiropractors at the crossroads of a profession may see advantages in highlighting its spiritual dimensions. 260 t h e w o r l d o f c h i r o p r a c t i c Though receptive to vitalism, the American clientele is spiritually capricious. Today chiropractic faces a growing number of Metaphysically oriented competitors. As the early movement gained success and visibility, practitioners from other systems gravitated to chiropractic. The rosters of early graduates from chiropractic colleges included many students with previous training in homeopathy, osteopathy, and eclectic medicine. Through much of the twentieth century, chiropractic offered protections unavailable to most competing systems. But with the mainstreaming of alternative medicine, there is far less incentive for practitioners to consolidate into a single profession, and much greater motive to return to the historic pattern of differentiation. The success of the chiropractic movement has benefited other alternative practitioners through increased public legitimacy, and the prospect of their own licensure and insurance coverage. Perhaps most important, chiropractors have offered other alternative health systems a model for professional organization. In this sense, chiropractors may have unintentionally energized their competition, for the number of touch-based treatment options continues to grow: healing touch, acupuncture, polarity therapy, energy focused bodywork, and many more. Similar to chiropractic, \"subtle energy\" healing has its roots in vital magnetism. In fact, in sampling contemporary Metaphysical writing, one sometimes finds references to E. D. Babbitt and William Denton\u2014writers D. D. Palmer collected in his Portable Library. Like their vital magnetic predecessors, energy healers envision a universe mediated by etheric vibration. Human beings are thought to be surrounded by magnetic auras that soften the boundary between the individual person and the cosmos. These ideas undergird Metaphysical apprehensions of healing as part of the complete perfection of the human being in body, mind, and spirit. While evidence-based studies challenging its premises continue to be published, the holistic wave shows no sign of abating. \"Energy\" has become a common religious idiom, its direct and implied meanings connecting scientific and religious ways of thinking, though energy-healing theories are strongly challenged by evidence-based researchers.26 Many current varieties of energy healing trace their origins to \"polarity therapy,\" a treatment developed by chiropractor Randolph Stone.27 A host of Asian energy-healing spiritualities are among the newest arrivals on the scene of holistic health care the West. Of these, the best known to Westerners is Reiki, which emerged in Japan during the 1920s.28 A Japanese-American woman named Hawayo Hiromi Takata introduced the practice to Hawaii in the mid-twentieth century. Like other forms of \"divine light healing,\" Reiki t h e w o r l d o f c h i r o p r a c t i c 261 draws on principles from Shinto and Japanese traditional medicine. Like chiropractic, it is a hands-on practice that inhabits the borderland between spiritual and physical care. The beliefs and practices associated with divine light energy, or Joh-rei, are shared by many of the Japanese shinshukyo, or new religions, that are trickling into Western countries and inspiring Westerners to create applied healing modalities of their own. Pamela Klassen and Candy Brown show how Eastern healing ideas have been readily adopted by both mainstream and Evangelical Christians. Reiki in particular has dovetailed nicely with the supernaturalism of the liberal healing ethos.29 Comparing chiropractic and energy healing raises an important point: chiropractic has no monopoly on spiritual healing in the free market of modern pluralism, and it is arguably a weaker competitor against systems defined more clearly as religions. Spirituality does not have the overt role in chiropractic that it has in Reiki, which announces itself as a religious path and includes directly theological doctrines like reincarnation. Setting aside the fact that Metaphysics is contested within the profession, to participate in healthcare systems in industrialized countries like the United States and Canada, chiropractic is limited in how it can present its spiritual dimensions. D. D. Palmer knew this, which is why he readily conceded the limits to the Religion of Chiropractic. Contemporary chiropractors have, however, fostered a dialogue with Asian medicine and spiritual ideas, which are almost completely absent from early chiropractic literature. Today, it is not uncommon for chiropractors to point out parallels between Innate Intelligence and energy theories like Chinese \"chi\" force or the Indian \"chakras,\" and some holistic practitioners see acupuncture as a sister discipline and perform both practices. Chiropractic writers also have started documenting the historic connections between their practice and energy healing.30 h o l i s m , p o p u l i s m , a n d a m e r i ca n i n to l e r a n ce Chiropractic illustrates how the ideological and therapeutic aspects of healthcare are intertwined. As our nation continues to debate the future of our healthcare system, I believe it is critical to try, as much as is possible, to distinguish the separate impetuses of different stakeholders. The popular intellectual culture that animated nineteenth-century radicalism reverberates in contemporary \"progressive\" spiritual, health, and political discourse. The chiropractic story carries all the countercurrents associated with the \"American Spirit\": libertarianism, communitarianism, and populist antiauthoritarianism above all. 262 t h e w o r l d o f c h i r o p r a c t i c But populism comes in brews of various strengths. The participation of chiropractors in radical groups seems to outstrip their natural distribution in the population. Chiropractors form a sizeable contingent of the Tea Party, and also of the Sovereignty and Tax Protest movements. And while the vast majority of chiropractors are not racists, a number of leaders of racist movements have been members of the profession. By far, the best-known chiropractor in the hate movement is Edward Reed Fields, co-founder and past president of the National States Rights Party, who studied at Palmer in the early 1950s. It is not clear whether Fields earned his diploma, unlike James Malcolm Edwards, who graduated from Palmer in 1951. In 1966 Edwards was named Grand Dragon of the United Klans of America for the State of Louisiana.31 Beyond the KKK, chiropractors have led other controversial movements. The notorious public-access television show Race and Reason was hosted by Florida chiropractor Herbert W. Poinsett. In the 1990s, Scott Anthony Stedeford studied chiropractic as he rose in the ranks of the Aryan Republican Army.32 More recently, South Carolina-based chiropractor William Carter, an associate of David Duke, has been a leader in the Populist Party and the Council of Concerned Citizens, and was one of the founders of the America First Party.33 In my research I have found no instance of someone associated with a hate group who is also recognized as a leader in the chiropractic profession (though Fields became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for white nationalists). One cannot rule out the possibility that extremists' chiropractic affiliations are highlighted as a way to heighten the perception of deviance surrounding extremely controversial figures. While Poinsett and Fields are minority voices in the chiropractic profession, there seems to be an elective affinity between the maverick stance cultivated in the profession and the reactionary spirit that fuels identity movements. Despite its emulation of regular medicine and its gradual acceptance as part of mainstream healthcare, chiropractic trades on a populist resentment of doctors. Chiropractic uses\u2014as it did years ago\u2014a rhetoric of persecution even as it has taken the offensive against regular medicine. In this respect, the profession fits the model of a \"beleaguered minority\" outlined by R. Laurence Moore.34 This creates a seedbed for stronger strains of American populism. It is not surprising that chiropractic polemics often have compared the medical profession to Nazis, and the persecution of chiropractic to \"medical racism.\" Here is where the libertarian and communal elements of chiropractic collide. The profession has succeeded in no small part by cultivating antiauthoritarian intellectual stances against medical and political authorities. Moreover, it has celebrated self-knowledge, through study or personal t h e w o r l d o f c h i r o p r a c t i c 263 intuition, as an authentic epistemological source\u2014superior to information communicated by experts and far better than challenges in the court of public opinion. Chiropractic is not socially deviant. Rather, it thrives by drawing on widespread cultural assumptions about health, the body, and the role of healers. Even so, from the time of the Palmers, chiropractors have inoculated themselves against attacks by interpreting criticism as persecution, which means extremists have developed defenses against censure. The profession really cannot control its radical members. The situation in chiropractic raises some interesting and possibly inconvenient truths about alternative medicine: above all, that health protests are popular across the political and ideological spectrums. In what some may regard as a more disturbing development, alternative medicine has become a rallying issue for right-wing political groups. Today, warnings of \"health tyranny\" and calls for \"health liberty\" are frequently found in the position statements of Patriot, Tea Party, and white nationalist groups. One example is the manifesto \"Seven Freedom-Principles That Are Not Negotiable\" on the white nationalist website VDARE.com, which calls for \"The Right to Determine One's Own Healthcare\": Free men and women absolutely have the right to refuse vaccinations for themselves and their children. Forced vaccinations (of any kind) are an assault against the very foundation of freedom. Free men have the right to choose their own physicians, their own hospitals, their own insurance programs, etc. They also have the right to refuse any and all of the above. God is Creator. He is also Healer (Exodus 15:26). Therefore, how men choose to seek God's healing is a private matter between them and God. Alternative medicine is a right. Already, our military personnel are used as human guinea pigs to test a variety of drugs and chemicals. Public schools also require forced vaccinations. And now the push is on to force the general population to take the Swine Flu vaccine. At the current pace, it won't be long until all alternative medicines and treatments will be illegal and the federal government will be America's doctor. This is not acceptable.35 I am intrigued and surprised this phenomenon has gone largely unnoticed. The interest in health alternatives is easy to detect in \"New Age\" groups aligned with liberal politics and \"progressive\" lifestyles, but in fact it thrives across the American politico-cultural landscape. It is possible that studies have focused on their quietist elements, and overlooked less placid 264 t h e w o r l d o f c h i r o p r a c t i c expressions. Alternative medicine has succeeded in no small part because it has cultivated an antiauthoritarian metanarrative with great cultural appeal\u2014suspicion and resentment of elites and elevation of the \"wisdom of common people.\" Placing personal and cultural dissent at the forefront of alternative and complementary medicine points to a new interpretive task: comprehending how and why healthcare is such an astonishingly effective vehicle for social protest.36 The impulse to assert oneself against a depersonalizing industrial culture, and even to mount a social movement, through the \"body, mind, and spirit\" is, I believe, a very potent force in both culture and the individual psyche. The religion scholar Vasudha Narayanan has identified health as one of the essential sites for human meaning-making, offering a unique type of \"epistemological authenticity\" for individuals and societies.37 As Pamela Klassen discovered of women choosing home birth, healthcare decisions are in no small part embodied resistance against technological excesses, so that \"constructing the natural is a political act.\"38 The strength of alternative medicine as a political vehicle makes it challenging to manage through regulation. Populist rhetoric often is used to conceal weaknesses in alternative medicine, but because health care is a site where resentments against social forces can be played out, such attempts to influence the public mind frequently succeed. Like the vitalist legacy, chiropractic will have to negotiate its political orientations. In America, populism has carried both a nationalist impulse and a hostility toward the state. In an international context, an American-born movement like chiropractic may be well suited to activate antiauthoritarian sentiments, but other systems may be better equipped to draw on nationalist feelings. Chiropractors, in contrast, may suffer from bearing an \"outsider\" image. Whether chiropractic can be called \"thoroughly American\" is a real question\u2014for starters, D. D. Palmer was an immigrant from Canada. More importantly, these attitudes and the problematic individualism behind them are found in many Western cultures, and could be characteristic of modernity more broadly. In this light, the international growth of chiropractic could be a proving ground for hypotheses about modernity, globalization, and cultural change. c h i r o p r a c t i c i n c a n a d a a n d g r e at b r i ta i n The closest comparison for American chiropractic is the status of the profession in Canada, where it established an early presence. Canadians patronize chiropractic at rates equal to or higher than Americans, and though the profession experiences all the same tensions as its southern neighbor, the conflicts t h e w o r l d o f c h i r o p r a c t i c 265 are more muted. Both these differences seem connected to the inclusion of chiropractic in a national healthcare system, which converts chiropractic to a system that, while holistically based, is treated matter-of-factly by patients who see it as a proper \"medical\" option for musculoskeletal complaints. To be sure, this attitude among patients is widespread in the United States as well, and quite likely in other countries. It frustrates many chiropractors that the public sees them only as \"back doctors.\" The evolution of chiropractic in Canada tracks the American story in many ways. In years past, Canadian chiropractors were prosecuted for practicing illicit medicine, and were regulated by government commissions and challenged by physicians' professional organizations. Today, the country has more than 6,500 chiropractors in practice.39 Just as chiropractic is regulated in the United States at the state level, Canada's provinces set standards for licensure. Chiropractors maintain one large professional association, the Canadian Chiropractic Association. Two Canadian schools offer chiropractic degrees: Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College, and the University of Quebec at Trois-Rivi\u00e8res. It is not clear who was the first chiropractor in Canada, but Almeda Jane Haldeman is recognized as one of the earliest pioneers.40 In 1905 Haldeman studied under E. W. Lynch at his Minneapolis-based Chiropractic School and Cure. In 1907 she opened a practice of her own in Saskatchewan. Around the same time, though, a number of other practitioners crossed the border, opening chiropractic offices and training institutes. Canadian chiropractors quickly organized into three rival associations. The Canadian Chiropractors Association and Dominion Chiropractors Association both had strong ties to the Palmer College of Chiropractic. In the third group, the Ontario Chiropractors Association, nearly all members were graduates of Universal Chiropractic College, the sectarian rival run by Joy Loban. In 1909, the first Canadian chiropractic school, Robbins School of Chiropractic, was started in Sault Ste. Marie.41 Though he was not the founder, Ernst DuVal\u2014a 1914 Palmer graduate and collaborator with B. J. on several pamphlets\u2014brought visibility to both Robbins School and Straight chiropractic. By 1915, a number of chiropractic colleges had been founded in Canada, but as in the United States, many were so short lived their names are lost. Toronto School of Chiropractic and Canadian Chiropractic College in Hamilton were the two other prominent schools at this time. The location of all three in Ontario was likely one of the reasons the provincial government launched an investigation in 1915. Appointed to lead the Commission on Medical Education, Supreme Court Justice Frank E. Hodgins interviewed more than 200 people, including the heads of the three 266 t h e w o r l d o f c h i r o p r a c t i c chiropractic colleges.42 His assessment of their quality of instruction was damning; Hodgins recommended closing all the chiropractic schools in Canada. But Hodgins' extensive interviews had also exposed him to many people who claimed chiropractic treatment had helped them. Especially moved by its benefits to soldiers in WWI, Hodgins recommended that spinal manipulation be incorporated into regular medicine. The Hodgins Commission signaled ongoing scrutiny for the chiropractic profession, as well as a desire to recognize its healing potential and public appeal. Both impulses were honored in 1925 when Canada passed the \"Drugless Practitioners Act,\" which made chiropractic legal, but limited the range of treatments chiropractors could use. It also required licensed chiropractors to hold degrees from accredited schools. The education and licensure requirements had devastating consequences for the profession, and by 1928 all the colleges had shut their doors. Chiropractic education was reintroduced in the 1940s. In 1943, the Dominion Chiropractors Association was reorganized as the Dominion Council of Canadian Chiropractors. With their founding of Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College in Toronto in 1945, chiropractic resumed its slow climb to respectability. Chiropractors' support from the general public appears to have been even stronger in Canada than in the United States. In 1959 the Ontario College of Physicians and Surgeons issued \"A Report on Osteopathy and Chiropractic\" as part of an offensive very similar to that of the American Medical Association (and unfolding at nearly the same time); but in 1961 a Royal Commission investigation deemed chiropractic a \"valid health service.\"43 By the early 1970s, chiropractic was covered as part of national health care. In 1991 the \"Regulated Health Professions Act\" was passed and replaced the 1925 law. Canadian chiropractors were accorded increased rights for diagnosis and practice, and gained the right to use the term \"doctor.\" Today Canadians are receptive to alternative medicine in general, and chiropractic in particular, at levels comparable to the United States.44 The Canadian Chiropractic Association estimates that more than 4.5 million patients visit chiropractors each year.45 Canada represents a best-case scenario for the profession. After Canada, chiropractic has had its greatest success in the United Kingdom, where it has been recognized statutorily by an act of Parliament. In Britain, however, chiropractors are restricted from offering treatments for certain conditions, including cancer, diabetes, tuberculosis and glaucoma.46 Chiropractic also has been well received in Australia and New Zealand, highlighting its appeal in English-speaking countries. Throughout most of the twentieth century, few places beyond the Anglophone world saw more than a handful of chiropractors set up practices. t h e w o r l d o f c h i r o p r a c t i c 267 diversified chiropractic While globalization of chiropractic has mostly happened in the past several decades, early international pioneers can be found.47 In 1906, four chiropractic students from Europe matriculated at the PSC. Two were women, Elizabeth Van Raders from Nice, France, and Marie S. Nesseth of Norway. One of the men, C. Rassmussen, also was Norwegian; the other was Godfrey P. M. Heathcote from Great Britain.48 All four went to Europe after graduation, but Raders and Heathcote both returned to the United States. Chiropractic did not draw much more international interest until after World War I, but between 1918 and 1924, the practice was introduced in over ten countries: Belgium, Italy, Denmark, France, Norway (a reintroduction), Netherlands, Sweden, Spain, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Germany. By the time the European Chiropractic Union (ECU) was chartered in 1932, as many as 200 chiropractors were practicing. The largest group was in Britain, and there were strong contingents in the Nordic countries.49 This estimate conceals the likelihood that many practitioners were offering \"spinal bodywork,\" yet reveals a pattern in the international growth of chiropractic. The ECU recognized Straight practitioners, usually with direct ties to an American school. But the practice was also offered by Mixers, with some of the credit going to Joseph Janse of National College of Chiropractic, who launched a program of international outreach. And beyond the profession, spinal treatments also were performed by naturopaths and other holistic practitioners. Then and now, policies regulating who could claim to offer chiropractic under that name varied country by country, with the sole consistency being a competitive business climate. Though Germany is very receptive to holism, the early history of chiropractic in Germany shows some of the ways chiropractors may have trouble presenting their system as an attractive option. When chiropractic arrived in Germany, an array of forces either advanced or blocked the profession. At first glance, one would think of Germany as hospitable land for chiropractic. The country was one of the birthplaces of medical vitalism. It had a health-reform movement comparable to America's, and the Metaphysical spiritualities that sustained alternative medicine in the United States had strong counterparts in Germany, especially Anthroposophy. Furthermore, in Germany many holistic treatments were regarded as coming from traditional medicine, and were supported as part of the v\u00f6lkisch movement. Yet if \"natural medicine\" was aligned with nationalism in both countries, this resonance proved a specific obstacle for chiropractic. Alternative medicine was promoted by the Third 268 t h e w o r l d o f c h i r o p r a c t i c Reich. Instrumentally, this was an attempt to promote v\u00f6lkisch culture and fill the gaps left by purges of Jewish doctors, but natural healing also was of special interest to certain officials in the Nazi party.50 One of the lead promoters was Rudolf Hess, who was influential in obtaining government recognition for holistic practitioners (Heilpraktiker), and who promoted naturopathy and other alternative treatments at the hospital he oversaw in Dresden. Later in life, Hess appears to have endorsed chiropractic, but it is unclear whether he did so in the 1930s. Whether Hess crossed paths with early German chiropractors is unknown, though he certainly had occasion to do so, for one of the few American-trained chiropractors in Germany worked out of Dresden before the war. Gustav Adolf Zimmer was born in Germany, where he trained as a Moravian pastor.51 He emigrated to New York in 1900, and for the next 20 years served German evangelical churches in the Midwest and Ontario. By 1923, Zimmer had trained as a chiropractor, and was practicing both vocations. He returned to Germany in 1927, where he opened a chiropractic school in Dresden. Zimmer published several pamphlets and at least one monograph on chiropractic.52 The fact that three of his works were banned as dangerous \"alien literature\" attests to chiropractic being a poor fit with German alternative medicine before World War II.53 It seems that an American system was seen as incompatible with German nationalism. Zimmer's censure also reflected ambivalence in the German government about alternative medicine. The 1935 law that recognized holistic practitioners limited their ability to teach or certify new Heilpraktiker. Zimmer's attempt to teach chiropractic asserted an independence that was consistent with popular intellectualism, but which in Europe often has marked alternative healers for surveillance and persecution. It may have been a hope of improving his standing with the government that led Zimmer to publish a book entirely devoted to race theories, but Race and Backbone does not seem to have materially affected his situation.54 Zimmer retired in 1938. He was nearing 70 years of age, and died the following year. The outbreak of World War II ended the international growth of chiropractic. After WWII, chiropractic's trajectory slowed in many countries. There were different cultural responses to chiropractic theory and the American proprietary model. Individual chiropractors continued to build practices, but government structures affected how they could work. After World War II, a new Heilpraktiker law was passed in Germany that extended its protections to chiropractors, but not before B. J. Palmer precipitated a small crisis. In 1954 German physicians invited him to visit and lecture. B. J. realized accepting the invitation would be symbolically siding with the medical profession and t h e w o r l d o f c h i r o p r a c t i c 269 so he declined it. But the \"German issue\" still cost him support among European Straight chiropractors.55 Since then, interest in alternative medicine among the public has created incentives for physicians to learn complementary practices. In the 1970s, medical doctors in Germany won the right to specialize in certain alternative treatments, including chiropractic. Alternative medicine has become increasingly integrated into the allopathic medical profession. According to the World Health Organization, 12,000 German physicians specialize in manual therapy, alongside 12,000 Heilpraktiker.56 The European Chiropractic Union reorganized in 1965 and for several decades institutional development progressed in fits and starts. Chiropractors now are working in nearly every country, if often only in small numbers. In recent decades, the globalization of chiropractic has been an accelerating phenomenon. Since the matriculation of Shegataro Morikubo, individual students have come to the United States to study chiropractic, but they are now arriving in greater numbers. Concurrently, the profession is advancing international chiropractic education. The Anglo-European College of Chiropractic was established in Bournemouth, England in 1965. This was the first permanent school to be established in Europe. Only one member of the first matriculating class stayed to graduate in 1969, but by 1975, ninety-three students had completed the program.57 Since the 1990s, a number of chiropractic training programs have been established at public universities in Europe.58 These programs have brought legitimacy to the practice, but they affect the balance of power for European chiropractors. In 2012 there were 41 chiropractic training programs operating in 16 countries. At the top of the list was the United States with 17, followed by Australia (4), and the United Kingdom (3). Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, and Spain each had 2 schools operating. Chiropractic education also has been introduced in Denmark, France, Switzerland, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, Chile, and New Zealand.59 The spread of chiropractic into other countries shows an array of challenges. Chiropractors face problems with social legitimacy in many countries, affecting their operational freedom. Governments can take very different policy approaches to alternative medicine. In some nations chiropractic is borderline illegal; it is licensed and regulated in others.60 Reimbursement for chiropractic treatment also varies. In some countries, chiropractic is only covered with a physician's referral, and some national healthcare systems do not cover alternative treatments at all, or limit coverage to treatments done by licensed physicians. Internationally there are different standards determining who can call themselves chiropractors, 270 t h e w o r l d o f c h i r o p r a c t i c from requiring a degree from a chiropractic college, to allowing a range of practitioners to perform spinal manipulation. Historically, chiropractic has spread to new regions by entrepreneurial practitioners, but some countries, such as Mexico, restrict noncitizens from working as medical providers. There, it might be legal for chiropractors to open businesses, but they cannot claim the status of health professionals that would advance the practice institutionally. Chiropractic is hindered, too, by the fact that in some countries regular physicians are licensed to offer alternative treatments. In places like Indonesia, therefore, there is no practical way to stop medical doctors from offering spinal therapies under the chiropractic brand.61 In North America chiropractic has succeeded by being protean, but the challenges of the global future will need to be met with a stronger consensus on identity. Official chiropractors are by no means the only transmitters of the practice. In Sweden, healthcare practitioners who do bodywork involving the spine can call their services chiropractic. In 2013 there were about 1,400 licensed practitioners, but many were naturopaths, physiotherapists or physicians. Possibly 100 would be recognized as chiropractors by the American profession. In countries with less centralized healthcare, a different pattern emerges. Just as missionaries inspired the formation of indigenous Christianities, bonesetters and other traditional bodywork-based healers seem to be adopting the chiropractic label without pursuing formal chiropractic education. In the Philippines, for example, the folk healing practice of hilot has been aligned quite strongly as an equivalent system.62 The common theme in these contexts is that chiropractors cannot define and control the boundaries of their practice. In some ways, the expansion of the chiropractic brand is consistent with the history of the profession. Not only is chiropractic consistently interdependent with other systems, intellectual property (and its pilfering) are persistent antagonists in the chiropractic story. But this historic consistency is lost on chiropractors when pilfering practitioners tarnish the chiropractic name, as happened in the United Kingdom in 2007, when a London-based self-proclaimed Buddhist guru named Mohan Singh was charged with raping dozens of women while performing chiropractic adjustments.63 Chiropractors need to collectively respond to such infringements, but the necessary consensus is not easy to build. Chiropractors have to respond to problems as they emerge in their respective countries, even as the chiropractic movement seeks a unified voice. And though they do not always use t h e w o r l d o f c h i r o p r a c t i c 271 the terms Straight and Mixer, international chiropractors are also organized into factions. As in the United States, where organizational leadership is shared between the American Chiropractic Association and International Chiropractors Association, several organizations negotiate for the profession overseas and compete for the right to create chiropractic identity. One of the most prominent international bodies is the World Federation of Chiropractic (WFC), an association of national chiropractic associations. Chartered in 1987, the WFC was reorganized ten years later, at which time it gained recognition from the World Health Organization as an NGO.64 While both the ACA and ICA are members, it is telling that the WFC was not launched by American chiropractors, but rather as an initiative of the European Chiropractic Union. The WFC supports the subluxation-based, spine-centered treatment model for the chiropractic system, but it is not a strong proponent of Chiropractic Philosophy. Separate from the WFC, a different faction has represented and promoted chiropractic before the United Nations. The Chiropractic Leadership Alliance is an organization of Super Straights. Its main founder, Christopher Kent, is an American chiropractor who has set up 200 \"wellness centers\" in the United States and abroad, under the business name, On Purpose, LLC.65 Kent was the first chiropractor to chair the United Nations NGO Health Committee, and his success points to the enduring potential of entrepreneurial chiropractors to shape the profession. The internationalization of chiropractic sounds notes from the history of the profession, as well as chords from religion and globalization. Those involved in globalizing chiropractic will find outcomes depend on many factors: the role and power of folk healing traditions in the receiving culture; receptivity to the brand of Western holism; hostility to alternative religions or health options; and state policies toward both religious and medical \"sects.\" In other words, the globalization of chiropractic follows many of the lines of transnationalizing religion. The proximity of chiropractic to religion, however, presents practical impediments. Despite the growing appeal of holism, alternative medicine often is viewed with suspicion. In some nations, such as Hungary and Russia, concern about \"religious cults\" has been redirected toward alternative medicine. In France, chiropractic was legalized in 2002, and in 2011 a law was passed for its regulation.66 But the government's controversial anticult ministry issued a report in 2012 that warned against unconventional treatments, after data indicated as much as 40 percent of the population used some form of alternative medicine.67 272 t h e w o r l d o f c h i r o p r a c t i c a c o da o n e s ot e r i c ch i ro p r act i c : l o o k i n g b a c k wa r d a n d s e e i n g a h e a d Internationalization will \"stretch\" chiropractic, inspiring the profession to strengthen or attenuate historic content and commitments. Hans Baer regards the business orientation of American chiropractic as something that sets it apart from how the practice operates in other countries.68 I believe the commercial elements will be carried over only to the extent that receiving countries welcome American-style consumerism and personal-success ideology. On the other hand, other themes associated with the American profession may become more pronounced in different cultural contexts. Alternative health is a major interest for esotericism, though this often goes unnoticed. In an international context, chiropractic engagement with esotericism may increase. An occult orientation extends rather deep into the chiropractic cultural milieu, though less so into the chiropractic profession. It should be noted that the chiropractic profession is not affiliated with any occult movement, and most practitioners are not esotericists. Yet there are many individual chiropractors who claim to be esoteric students\u2014and among these, Rosicrucian affiliations in particular stand out. For the meaning of this connection to be clear, let me present some key points on the Rosicrucians, a set of fraternal orders that keep their membership secret. Rosicrucianism is a knowledge-based tradition. Many orders have initiatory practices; others engage members primarily through correspondence courses and social media. Including distance learning, it is likely that there are at least 100,000 Rosicrucian students worldwide. The Rosicrucian tradition is an important source for the Metaphysical imagination. Some of the influence of Rosicrucianism in Western metaphysics has been charted. Rosicrucian writers developed theories about Atlantis, Lemuria, Ancient Egypt, and Mount Shasta that are well-known in popular culture. Rosicrucian ideas influenced Theosophy and its descendants, and several new religious movements, including the I AM movement, the Church Universal and Triumphant, and the Order of the Solar Temple.69 Rosicrucianism has roots in the German Reformation.70 In 1614 a \"manifesto\" was anonymously published in Kassel, Germany. The Fama announced to the world the Brotherhood of Rosicrucians, a \"fraternity of illuminati\" that kept their identities secret but were destined to be the true movers of history. Two more documents soon appeared that built on the legend of the Brotherhood of Christian Rosenkreutz: the Confessio in 1515 and the Chemical Wedding the following year. It is likely the original Rosicrucian manifestos were t h e w o r l d o f c h i r o p r a c t i c 273 authored by a Lutheran minister named Johann Valentin Andrae, possibly in an attempt to inspire a social reform movement. The manifestos could be called a literary hoax, and though Frances Yates found evidence of one group of \"Societas Christiani,\" they do not seem to have prompted the formation of many societies in Germany.71 In the public imagination, though, support for an idealized Rosicrucian brotherhood became associated with politicized Protestantism. During the Thirty Years' War, the Rosicrucian idea spread across Europe as a symbolic issue dividing Catholics and Protestants, a discursive battle fought through new manifestos and anti-Rosicrucian polemics. At some point, Rosicrucian enchantment moved from imagined communities to social networks; the print war over secret societies seems to have inspired their real formation. As the movement spread to Britain during the Cromwell period, it became aligned with prominent scientists, including John Dee, Francis Bacon, and Robert Boyle. Though they never left, the distinctly Christian elements of the Rosicrucian tradition receded over time. Many elements of Rosicrucian history are difficult to verify, but one of the clearest features to discern is a strong connection to the healing arts that has been maintained since the revival of the tradition in the late eighteenth century. The modern tradition considers Western alchemy a major influence, so that figures like Paracelsus, Von Agrippa, Robert Fludd, and Van Helmont are revered sources of wisdom. The Rosicrucian societies that exist now descend from ones that developed in Britain and France in the nineteenth century. Vitalist physicians were strongly represented among the founders of the new orders.72 It seems plausible that figures like Michael Maier, William Westcott, and G\u00e9rard Anaclet Vincent Encausse helped establish a symbiosis between esoteric spirituality and vitalist medical theory. Most American orders trace their founding to the lodges started by Paschal Beverly Randolph, an African American eclectic physician. In the 1850s Randolph traveled to France, where he was introduced to the teachings of the French esotericist Eliphas Levi. In London Randolph was initiated by Hargrave Jennings into the Order of the Rose. Randolph returned to the United States in 1861, and founded the Rosicrucian Fraternity Lodge in San Francisco and a second society in Boston several years later. Randolph died violently in 1875, but his lodges inspired other American Metaphysicians to start Rosicrucian societies. Because groups close and new ones often are formed in secret, one cannot say exactly how many exist. Today the most prominent societies in the United States are the Fraternitas Rosae Crucis in Quakertown, Pennsylvania, and two in California: the Rosicrucian Fellowship in Oceanside, and 274 t h e w o r l d o f c h i r o p r a c t i c the Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis (AMORC)\u2014the world's largest Rosicrucian order\u2014in San Jose. John Deveney's biography of Paschal Beverly Randolph depicts the occultist as being completely immersed in the vital magnetic subculture. Randolph's writings on health and sexuality baked vital magnetism into the cake of American Rosicrucianism.73 In the early twentieth century, virtually all Rosicrucian leaders made vibrational healing part of their occult practices. One example is Harvey Spencer Lewis, the first Imperator of AMORC, who believed the Essenes had a healing sect, the \"Therapeuti\" that performed vibrational healing. Lewis wrote, \"It is the 'vibratory energy' that is referred to in our earliest monographs under various names, and which constitutes the real key to the healing processes in the Rosicrucian system.\"74 In the Rosicrucian Manual, Lewis demonstrated his commitment to nerve tracing, reprinting a \"ganglion chart\" someone familiar with popular neurocentric physiology would recognize.75 Such charts have become a staple in Rosicrucian physiology, and stand as evidence of the intersectionality of the esoteric and vertebral vitalist traditions. A meaningful example is the ganglionic chart posted to an online discussion for \"Rosicrucians of Greater Cleveland,\" with the accompanying message, \"This is basic chiropractic knowledge.\"76 Certain elements in Rosicrucian philosophy make healing a core feature. Alchemy and astrology, two hermetic sciences that loom large in the Rosicrucian tradition, both historically included therapeutic components. In the contemporary tradition, healing is seen as part of the complete perfection of the human being (in body, mind, and spirit) that is a prominent \"religious goal.\" The restoration of health is expressed in a vocabulary of scientific change: evolution, transformation, metamorphosis, and alchemical transmigration.77 Furthermore, Rosicrucians see healing as part of their mandate to serve humanity. Today, healing is the mission of the Great White Brotherhood.78 And AMORC addresses healing through the \"Cathedral of the Soul\"\u2014a prayer group that holds daily and weekly sessions responding to prayer requests. The therapeutic rationale for Rosicrucian prayer shows the vital magnetic heritage, with one contributor to Rosicrucian Digest describing the Cathedral of the Soul as \"a focal point of Cosmic radiations and thought waves from which radiate vibrations of health, peace, happiness, and inner awakening.\"79 Today, few medical doctors publicly acknowledge Rosicrucian membership, nor are they strongly represented among active Rosicrucian writers. While Rosicrucianism's ties to regular medicine may have attenuated, two vitalist health options, chiropractic and naturopathy seem to have inherited the healing legacy. Rosicrucian membership is not disclosed to the public, but it is easy to find figures t h e w o r l d o f c h i r o p r a c t i c 275 through their websites. A remarkable number of spiritually oriented chiropractors and health innovators in close proximity identify as Rosicrucians, including Randolph Stone, a graduate of National College of Chiropractic and the creator of polarity therapy; and Ida Pauline Rolf, the founder of Rolfing. Esotericism seems to be more popular with Mixers than Straights, and among chiropractors who maintain dual certification as naturopaths. It is hard to say how far and deep the Rosicrucian influence goes in chiropractic. While there is no definitive proof of their membership, William Juvenal Colville and Elbert Hubbard, who were so influential for D. D. and B. J., are both claimed by contemporary Rosicrucians as part of the brotherhood. It is clear D. D. was familiar with the work of William Walker Atkinson, who, in addition to promoting the Law of Attraction, wrote The Secret Doctrine of the Rosicrucians under the pseudonym Magus Incognito.80 For his part, B. J. Palmer read Rosicrucian writers like Hargrave Jennings, subscribed to theories of Atlantis, and was an advanced Scottish Rite Free Mason. Two chiropractors were aides to Alistair Crowley, founder of the Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO) and Thelema. Gabriel Montenegro Vargas remained a close associate of Crowley until his mentor's death, after which he affiliated with the Agape Lodge.81 While Montenegro Vargas trained as a chiropractor before becoming involved in OTO, Israel Regardie only trained at Los Angeles College of Chiropractic (LACC) later in his career. Regardie served as secretary to Aleister Crowley for a short time before moving on to other esoteric societies, including the Stella Matutina, a branch of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, whose secrets he revealed in My Rosicrucian Adventure.82 Beyond the presence of Regardie at LACC, California was a special site for the cross fertilization of chiropractic and esotericism. Max Heindel, of the Rosicrucian Fellowship, offered chiropractic at the Mt. Ecclesia Sanitarium in Oceanside.83 Southern California also was the base for Nephi Cottam, who superseded his training at Palmer College of Chiropractic to develop \"Craniopathy,\" which he taught at a proprietary institute in Los Angeles.84 Originally a Latter-day Saint, Cottam is remembered by chiropractors as a significant Mormon \"Pioneer,\" but in the occult milieu he is noted for having a minor role in the litigation against I AM movement leader Guy Ballard.85 More remarkably, Cottam is cited by Raymond Bernard\u2014founder of the Renewed Order of the Solar Temple\u2014as an informant in his book The Hollow Earth.86 And it is a useful side point that Manly Palmer Hall, founder of the Philosophical Research Society in Los Angeles, was from a chiropractic family\u2014both his mother and grandmother were chiropractors. Furthermore, at least two Rosicrucian orders were founded or led by doctors of chiropractic. The Societas Rosicruciana in America (SRIA) was founded 276 t h e w o r l d o f c h i r o p r a c t i c in 1907 by Sylvester C. Gould. When Gould died two years into his endeavor, a chiropractor named George Winslow Plummer took over leadership and incorporated the society in 1912. The SRIA is currently based in Sound Beach, New York, where they promote the healing properties of meditation. Also on the East Coast, based in Quakertown, Pennsylvania, the Fraternitas Rosae Crucis (FRC) is smaller than the prominent California societies, but its chiropractic heritage is most prominent. A property dispute in the 1990s revealed many details about the FRC, including the fact that through several transitions, most leaders have been chiropractors or naturopaths.87 In fact, the lineage is so strong the FRC looks, from one perspective, like a professional chiropractic fraternity. For nearly all of its history, the campus in Quakertown, PA has operated health clinics. The FRC was founded by Reuben Swinburne Clymer, who graduated from a chiropractic school in Seattle and practiced as a naturopath in Pennsylvania. Author of a number of health books, including The Natura Physician, Clymer became a prominent opponent of compulsory vaccination. Clymer established the public arm of the FRC, the Church of Illumination, around 1909. Today, the Church of Illumination is widely referenced on anti-vaccination websites as an effective vaccine opt-out tool. Sounding echoes of D. D. Palmer's Chiropractic Religion, the Church of Illumination offers long-distance membership to anyone agreeing with its beliefs, including the \"Tenet on Vaccination and Immunization.\"88 Rosicrucianism is in some ways chiropractic's \"alter\"\u2014a system that, unlike chiropractic or osteopathy intentionally cultivated the spiritual elements of vitalism. However intriguing it may be, I have delayed introducing the Rosicrucian connection, partly because there is not enough information to make a stronger case for the Palmers' involvement, but mostly because there is no sign of the chiropractic profession has any organized involvement with esotericism. I realize it is a provocative assertion to draw connections between American healthcare providers and secret societies accused by conspiracy theorists of being \"Illuminati.\" My intent is to temper the sensationalism surrounding Metaphysicians, and to build an appreciation of their cultural enterprise, including the robust human networks that have supported it. One seldom finds specific occupations so visible in a religious movement. Certainly, the vocational affinity needs more study. For its adherents, esoteric chiropractic appears to operate as a parallel tradition. The engagement of chiropractors in a scientific health profession alongside idealist esoteric philosophy shows a new expression of faith and work, one well suited to our post-industrial, atomized, but highly information-based society. In many countries, the past fifty years have seen distinct change in how people use t h e w o r l d o f c h i r o p r a c t i c 277 religions' social institutions\u2014breaking away from places of worship where they once would have identified as members, and becoming religious individualists. Perhaps Rosicrucianism is the undiscovered fruit of Chiropractic Philosophy, one that fulfills D. D. Palmer's call for a \"Chiropractic Religio.\" For believers, it seems to offer purpose and meaning, strengthening their legs for the journey, and directing them to put their hands to work. Scholars often point out the \"optimism\" of Metaphysical spiritualities, but in assessing the potential for esoteric chiropractic, it is best to keep one's expectations realistic. Rosicrucian groups are active not only in Europe, but also Brazil, Nigeria, and other modernizing countries. In those places, esoteric channels may become an important conduit for chiropractic teaching. Given that esotericism is usually controversial in the areas where it is popular, however, highlighting an occult connection would likely be counterproductive. Furthermore, the fragmentation of ideologies in chiropractic will probably continue, and Metaphysical chiropractors will find it difficult to grow into anything more than a notable faction. lo o k i n g b ack to s e e a h e a d Shall chiropractic survive? I believe the idea of chiropractic will thrive. Chiropractic is well-positioned in the contest for nomenclature: globally, spinal manipulation therapies are likely to be associated with \"chiropractic.\" Furthermore, the great organizational skills of the profession in North America may have the best shot to fulfill Thomas Jefferson's aspiration for a distinctly \"American\" health system. In an 1807 letter often quoted by medical sectarians, Jefferson hoped, \"that it is from this side of the Atlantic, that Europe, which has taught us so many other things, will at length be led into sound principles in this branch of science, the most important of all others, being that to which we commit the care of health & life.\"89 Transnationally, chiropractic will feel pressure on some of its cultural boundaries. In the United States, chiropractic has prospered by cultivating a maverick identity styled by the cultural iconography of American masculinity. But individualism and antiauthoritarianism are not unique to America. Rather, they are part of changes observed by Ernst Troeltsch that have unfolded in many industrialized societies. Chiropractic may be a bellwether for American exceptionalism, but even without an \"American style,\" to the extent that global chiropractic is populist, it almost certainly will face scrutiny for challenging the social order. At the same time, such challenges are vital to the appeal of alternative medicine\u2014the \"life fountain\" of popular healing. There lies the paradox of a social movement based on contestation. 278 t h e w o r l d o f c h i r o p r a c t i c notes introduction 1.
