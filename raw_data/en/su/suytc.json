Thorium-contaminated materials may exist in some portions of the Streeterville Area. If subsurface thorium wastes are uncovered without proper environmental controls, workers and the public may be exposed to unhealthy radiation levels. An applicant seeking a permit for any underground work in the Streeterville Area must ensure proper monitoring takes place any time excavation or ground breaking occurs. Please note that permits which involve work in the Thorium Monitoring Area will have a hold in the City Permit System and the applicant must schedule an appointment with CDPH before the hold can be released and a permit can be issued. Radiation monitoring is required for ground breaking work on private property or in the Right-of-Way in the Thorium Monitoring Area. If CDPH determines that radiation monitoring is required, the applicant must then complete a form agreeing to conduct proper radiation monitoring. This form must be completed and submitted to CDPH prior to each instance of scheduled soil excavation or ground exposure. Failure to complete this form may result in the delay of permits. Please call (312) 745-8332 to schedule an appointment. Please view the [aerial map](/content/dam/city/depts/cdph/environment/streeterville-right-of-way/lindsay-light-streeterville-map-201510.pdf) to see if the proposed work might be located in the Thorium Monitoring Area.
