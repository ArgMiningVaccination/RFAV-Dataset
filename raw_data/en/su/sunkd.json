A stroke is a medical emergency that occurs when blood flow to the brain is interrupted or reduced. When this happens, brain cells don't get the oxygen and nutrients they need and begin to die. Quick treatment is key to limiting damage to the brain. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reports that stroke is a leading cause of death in the United States. (1) More than 795,000 Americans have a stroke each year, which is one stroke every 40 seconds. (2) Stroke is also a leading cause of disability and can lead to loss of mobility, impaired speech, and changes to learning and understanding. (3) Many people also experience changes in their mood or personality. (3) Although older people have a higher risk of stroke than younger people, strokes can occur at any age. Recognizing the signs of a stroke can help ensure people get the treatment they need as soon as possible.

There are two types of strokes: ischemic and hemorrhagic, with the former making up 87% of all strokes. (2) Each type has a different cause. Ischemic strokes can be caused by blocked arteries. This happens when blood vessels become narrow or obstructed, often due to a buildup of fatty deposits in the blood vessel. It can also occur when a blood clot or other debris travels through the bloodstream. A leaking or burst blood vessel causes hemorrhagic strokes. Conditions that can affect blood vessels and lead to hemorrhagic stroke include high blood pressure, aneurysms, overtreatment with blood thinners, and protein deposits in blood vessel walls. Head trauma can also cause hemorrhagic stroke. Numbness or weakness in the face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body Confusion, trouble speaking, or difficulty understanding speech Trouble seeing in one or both eyes Trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance, lack of coordination Severe headache with no known cause Less common symptoms include phantom smells, nausea, and vomiting. All these symptoms are caused by damage to brain cells. A 2005 study found that only 43% of respondents could identify all five stroke warning signs. (4) In the two decades since, health organizations have been working to increase awareness of symptoms. The CDC recommends people act FAST if someone has symptoms of a stroke: Face: Ask the person to smile. Does one side droop? Arms: Ask the person to raise both arms. Does one arm drift downward? Speech: Ask the person to repeat a simple phrase. Is their speech slurred or strange? Time: Time is of the essence. Call 911 immediately. (5) An ambulance is essential for people who have had a stroke, as it allows lifesaving treatment to begin on the way to the emergency room. Stroke symptoms that clear after a few minutes could be a transient ischemic attack (TIA). One in five people who have a TIA experience a stroke or heart attack within one year, so it's important to talk to a doctor about these symptoms. (6) How Are Strokes Diagnosed? Other possible causes of stroke symptoms include a brain tumor and reactions to certain drugs. If a stroke has occurred, doctors also must determine what type of stroke it was to provide proper treatment. Many tests are used for stroke diagnosis: Physical exam: Listening to the heart and checking blood pressure Blood tests: Testing for infection and blood sugar levels, and seeing how fast blood clots Computed Tomography (CT) scan: An imaging test that creates a detailed image of the brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan: Uses radio waves and magnetic fields to create a detailed view of the brain and detect damage Neurological exam: Assessment of the nervous system to see how it's affected by the stroke Carotid ultrasound: Uses sound waves to view blood flow through the carotid arteries, which are in the neck Cerebral angiogram: A less common test in which dye injected into blood vessels make them visible by X-ray Echocardiogram: Uses sound waves to create detailed images of the heart and find the source of clots that may have traveled to the brain What Is the Best Treatment for a Stroke? Doctors administer drugs to break up blood clots that cause ischemic strokes. However, this is only possible within the first 3 hours of the stroke occurring. Other stroke treatments include administering blood thinners and performing surgery to remove the clot. For hemorrhagic strokes, doctors use medicine, surgery, or other procedures to stop the bleeding. It's also important to treat the underlying cause of the stroke. One in four people who have a stroke experience a second stroke within 5 years. (7) Lifestyle changes to decrease a person's risk factors can help prevent this outcome. Rehabilitation helps survivors manage the impacts of stroke. This is different for everyone, based on where damage occurred, but often includes physical, speech, and occupational therapy. Rehabilitation can take weeks, months, or years. Some people have long-term or lifelong disabilities after a stroke. How to Cope after a Stroke A stroke is a life-changing event, and survivors and caregivers commonly experience depression and anxiety. However, a stroke can also damage the parts of the brain that control emotions. A doctor can help determine the cause of mood changes. Psychological therapy and medications can help survivors and their caregivers manage mental health conditions. Other tips for coping after a stroke include: Be prepared: Talking to other survivors and specialists helps stroke survivors know what to expect. Join a support group: The American Stroke Association has support groups around the country. (8) Take steps toward a healthy lifestyle: This can help prevent future strokes and also helps a person feel more in control. Ask for help: Stroke survivors should let friends and family know what they need. Caregivers of stroke survivors should also practice self-care. Taking a break, eating healthily, and getting adequate rest can help. "}
