What equipment do I need for a video visit or virtual shared medical appointment? Video visits require access to a smartphone, tablet, or computer with a camera, microphone, and speakers. If you wish to participate in a virtual shared medical appointment, the Zoom application must be installed on the device you will use for the visit. How do I prepare for my video visit or virtual shared medical appointment? We recommend you complete these steps at least one day prior to your appointment: - If you haven't already, activate your MyChart account. - If using a smartphone for your visit, download the [MyClevelandClinic app](/mobile-apps/myclevelandclinic)or the [MyChart mobile app](/mobile-apps/mychart-app). - Complete PreCheck-In for your appointment in MyChart. This can be done as early as a week ahead of time. - Download Zoom on the device you will be using: - Make sure internet browser pop-up blockers are disabled for Zoom. - Complete assigned pre-visit questionnaires. If there are photos you would like to share with your provider, make sure to use the Document / Image / Photo ID questionnaire. - Check the camera, microphone, and speakers on your device to make sure they are working.

Video visits are not covered by all insurance plans. In order to fully understand your benefits and potential cost, contact your insurance company and ask if video visits are included in your plan and if not, what it may cost you. PreCheck-In What is PreCheck-In? PreCheck-In allows you to complete the pre-appointment process ahead of time, from the comfort of home. You can access PreCheck-In for your upcoming appointment in the MyChart mobile app or website as early as a week prior to your visit. With PreCheck-In, you can: - Verify and update demographics such as a home address, email address, and phone numbers. - Verify and update medical information such as medications, allergies, and current health issues. - Verify and update insurance information and upload your insurance card image. - Pay your insurance copay with a credit or debit card. - Electronically sign required forms or documents. - Complete pre-visit health questionnaires. How long does PreCheck-In take? The number of steps to complete may vary based on the type of appointment and when you were last seen. We recommend completing PreCheck-In at least one day before your visit to make sure you are prepared for your appointment. Do I have to sign-up for MyChart to use PreCheck-In? No. We are now sending PreCheck-In email reminders to all of our established patients with an email address on file. If you do not currently have a MyChart account, you receive a secure link that gives you temporary MyChart access to complete PreCheck-In. For security reasons, when you click the link, you will be asked to confirm your identity by verifying your demographic information. Once you complete PreCheck-In, you will have the option to create a MyChart account for yourself. Is PreCheck-In required to receive care at Cleveland Clinic? PreCheck-In is a required step for scheduled video visits. It is optional for in-person appointments and surgical visits. If you don't complete PreCheck-In, you will need to check in at a registration desk or kiosk on your day of service. If you'd like to use Mobile Check-In when you arrive for your appointment, you must complete PreCheck-In first. If you skip certain PreCheck-In steps (such as copay payment or document signature), you will be prompted to complete check-in at the front desk. How do I pay my copay? The ability to pay your insurance copay is an optional step during PreCheck-In. You can use a credit card that you've previously saved to your eWallet in MyChart, or add a new method of payment. Completing this step will pre-authorize your card for payment, and the card will not be charged until your appointment is complete. How does document signature work? During PreCheck-In, you will be able to view any forms that you need your signatures, such as our privacy practices or informed consent documents. You can then add an electronic signature to confirm that you have reviewed the information. To electronically sign documents, you will need to complete all required fields, including providing your home and cell phone numbers. If you are using the MyChart mobile app, you may need to swipe to the side to find these fields. Mobile Check-In Can I check in online for my upcoming appointment? We're now offering the ability to complete the check-in process through both the [MyClevelandClinic](/mobile-apps/myclevelandclinic) and MyChart mobile apps.* Mobile Check-In is an optional step that notifies your care team when you arrive for your appointment, allowing you to skip the line at the front desk. It is important to note that in order to access this step, you must download either the [MyClevelandClinic](/mobile-apps/myclevelandclinic) or the MyChart mobile app and complete the steps below prior to arriving for your appointment. *Nevada locations and select departments are excluded. How do I complete mobile check-in? You must complete the PreCheck-In process first, available up to seven days ahead of time. Once PreCheck-In is complete, the Mobile Check-In step will be available up to 15 minutes before your appointment. Please do not complete Mobile Check-In before you have arrived in the lobby or waiting area for your visit. If you have multiple appointments on the same day, you will need to check in for each one individually. - If you haven't already, download the MyClevelandClinic or MyChart mobile app. - Log in to your MyChart account through the app or website and complete PreCheck-In up to seven days before your appointment. - When prompted, or in your mobile app settings, make sure you have turned on the following features: - Appointment Arrival (turning on this setting will prompt you to enable location services on your mobile device). - Notifications - When you reach your appointment location, a pop-up will display to confirm you have arrived.

How do I create or adjust a payment plan? Once your statement is available, you will have the option to create a payment plan from your Account Summary in MyChart. Creating a payment plan means a set amount will be automatically charged to your credit card or deducted from your bank account on the same date each month. You will be able to choose the amount and the date; however, the system will require a minimum payment based on the total amount owed. You may also update an existing payment plan by changing the monthly amount, payment date, and/or payment method. Please note the following: - New balance amounts may be automatically added to your payment plan, which will increase the length of time needed to complete it. The monthly amount paid will not change. - Large balances that would require an increase in your monthly payment amount are not automatically added to an existing payment plan. - All balance amounts that have not been included in a payment plan should be paid by the due date indicated on the statement. - If you have any questions regarding your payment plan or billing statement, please contact customer service at 866.621.6385.

What if I try paperless statements and don't like it? Can I go back to getting paper statements? Yes, you can opt-out of receiving paperless statements.

For these services, you'll continue to receive paper statements unless you have made prior arrangements with those outside providers. I need help opting out of paperless billing. Is there someone I can call for assistance? Yes, Cleveland Clinic customer service representatives can help you opt out of paperless billing.

Anyone age 18 and over will be sent their statements directly unless you are the person responsible for the account (guarantor). If the patient is enrolled in MyChart, we'll automatically transition them to paperless billing on Sept. 1, 2022. What if my email address changes?

A passcode is required to log in on the Apple Watch\u00ae. Communicating with Your Care Team Can I message my Cleveland Clinic provider? You can send a secure message to your established provider regarding a non-urgent medical concern with Message My Doctor's Office. A member of your healthcare team will respond within three business days. An established provider is a provider that you have seen within the last three years. Message My Doctor's Office cannot be used to receive a diagnosis. Please schedule an appointment to address a new health issue or complete an eVisit. If you are experiencing an urgent medical problem, call 911 or your physician's office immediately. Will I get billed for MyChart messages? Starting November 17, 2022, [some MyChart messages will now be billed](/online-services/mychart/messaging) to your insurance. These are messages that take a longer amount of time for your provider to answer. They might also require your provider to dive into your medical history or look into changes to your treatment plan. MyChart questions like scheduling an appointment, getting a prescription refill or checking in after a procedure will continue to be free. Why are some messages billed to insurance? MyChart messaging has become a popular way to seek care at your convenience, saving time spent in the office or connecting through a video visit. The number of messages from patients seeking complex medical advice has increased drastically in recent years, and our providers spend a significant amount of time each day responding to these messages. Insurance companies, Medicaid and Medicare recognize that messaging is another way for patients to receive care. Messages that require more than 5 minutes of your provider's time and expertise are considered a form of telehealth and will be treated as such. It is important to understand that most messages sent through MyChart are handled quickly and will not be billed to insurance. If your message is billed to your insurance, you may not be charged or may see a low out-of-pocket cost. What types of providers will bill for messages? You will only ever be billed by a provider who is licensed to practice medicine without direction. This means you will not be billed when a clinician such as a registered nurse, social worker, or resident physician replies to your message. The kinds of providers who are currently billing for MyChart messages include: - Certified nurse midwives. - Licensed clinical psychologists (Ohio only). - Nurse practitioners / Clinical nurse specialists. - Physician assistants. - Physicians. - Optometrists. Will I be billed for messages from my care coordinator? No. Messages related to your Chronic Care Management program or other care coordination services will not be billed, as these communications are managed by nurses and social workers. Will I be billed when my provider sends the first message? You will not be billed when your provider initiates a message exchange with you. However, if you reply with a question about a new problem unrelated to the original conversation, the response may be billed if it takes more than five minutes for your provider to answer. Additionally, you will not be billed for submitting requested information such as home monitoring data (for example, blood pressure readings) or for completing questionnaires. What if I have questions about my bill or need financial assistance? Visit our [Billing and Finance page](/patients/billing-finance) for more information and to contact a customer service representative. Will someone answer my MyChart message 24/7? Our providers will do their best to answer your questions quickly. However, there are certain times when you won't get a response. Our providers won't respond to messages on nights, weekends or holidays. MyChart messages are not for urgent issues. If you have an emergency, please call 911 or go to your local emergency department. Can I get a diagnosis for a new health issue? Yes, for common, minor ailments. eVisits are a convenient, secure way to access Cleveland Clinic Express Care providers for the following issues: Adults (18 years old and over): - Back pain. - Urinary tract infection (women only). - Sinus infection. - Vaginal yeast infection. Simply select Message My Doctor/eVisit in the Messaging menu to begin. You will be asked to complete a quick series of questions related to your symptom history. A Cleveland Clinic Express Care provider will respond via secure message with a diagnosis and treatment instructions within one business day. If medication is prescribed, the prescription order will be sent directly to your preferred pharmacy. Patients must be located in Ohio and must have seen a Cleveland Clinic provider in the last three years. The cost to you for an eVisit will depend upon your insurance, and could range from $0 - $35. Will my provider contact me through MyChart? Your provider may add a comment within your test results or send a secure message to help you understand what the results mean. They may also recommend that you make a follow-up appointment, provide you with additional instructions, or ask you to call the office to discuss your test results. Your Medical Record My Preventive Care recommendations don't seem right to me, what should I do? Preventive Care procedures are suggested based on your age and gender, and in some cases, your individual health conditions. You are encouraged to discuss this information with your provider during your visit, and they can update any recommendations that may not apply to your specific situation. If you see that you are overdue for a regularly scheduled Preventive Care item, you can request an appointment through the Request An Appointment feature. How do I view clinical notes? Most types of provider notes* are accessible in MyChart. To view them, click on a past visit or hospital stay within Upcoming and Past Appointments in the Appointments menu, or click Admissions & Visit Summary/Visit Notes in the Health menu. On the mobile app, tap the Appointments icon and select a past visit or hospital stay. Notes are written in a way for your doctor and other health professionals on your care team to quickly understand your current health status. For help understanding your notes, [review a list of common medical terms and abbreviations](https://mychart.clevelandclinic.org/public/MyClevelandClinic-OpenNotes-Patient-Education.pdf). Although patient education is not the purpose of clinical notes, we hope that the release of this information will allow you to become more involved and knowledgeable regarding your healthcare. *At this time, Behavioral Health / Psychiatry notes are not released to MyChart. How do I view my orders? Click Upcoming Orders in the Appointments Menu. Standing and Future orders will display. Other tests ordered by your physician may appear in your After Visit Summary located in the Past Appointments menu. A Standing Order is a series of two or more of the same test, to be completed at a specified frequency (for example, once a month). A Future Order is a test to be completed within a time frame specified by your provider. If a date displays in the expected date column, your provider would like for you to complete testing on the date indicated or a couple of days after this date. If no date displays in the expected date column and the testing was not completed at the time of your office visit, contact your provider to determine when the testing should be completed. Be sure to follow any instructions your provider gives you regarding your orders. If you have any questions regarding the best date to complete your tests, contact your provider's office. How do I download or send my Visit Summary? You may download or send your Visit Summary from a past appointment, emergency department visit, or hospital stay. In the Health menu, click My Document Center, and select Visit Records. In this section, you may download one or multiple visit summaries at one time, and you may send these summaries to a provider outside of Cleveland Clinic. How do I get the complete set of my medical records? My Document Center allows you to request the release of up to 50 pages of your medical record to your account. You may obtain your complete medical record by contacting [Health Information Management](/patients/information/medical-records). Although Cleveland Clinic makes every effort to provide your medical records as quickly as possible, the HIPAA Privacy Rule gives Cleveland Clinic up to 30 days to respond to your request for medical records. If we are not able to respond within 30 days of receipt of your request, we will notify you in writing of the delay. Records released to your account will be available for 30 days to download, view, print, or save to another location. At this time, the option to send your child's medical records to your account is not available. Please contact HIM for these requests at 216.444.5580. Test Results When are my results released? At Cleveland Clinic we consider patients a part of the care team, and timely access to your health information is an important part of the decision-making process. In our commitment to transparency, patients have access to most test results as soon as they are available. Certain types of results, such as biopsies, are released after a short delay. These results and notes could include sensitive information such as a cancer diagnosis or the sex of your baby. You always have the choice to wait to view your information in MyChart until you speak with your provider. Can I see my radiology images? The text portion of your radiology imaging report can be viewed in Test Results. The actual radiology images are not available at this time. Contact the Radiology Department to request copies of your images (for example, X-Rays or CT Scans). Medications Why don't all my medications appear in my list? Your medication list will only show current prescriptions, discontinued medications are not included. Prescriptions from healthcare providers outside of Cleveland Clinic will not appear unless they are documented by your Cleveland Clinic provider. How do I renew prescriptions? You may submit a renewal request when you are out of refills for a medication that has been prescribed by a Cleveland Clinic provider. You should provide the following information for a prescription renewal: - Your preferred pharmacy. - The number of pills (30 or 90 day supply). - The number of refills for the prescription. - The method by which the renewal should be processed (i.e., should it be sent to the pharmacy or mailed to your home). - Any new allergies that you have experienced. Every attempt is made to process prescription renewals within 48 hours during normal business hours. If you submit your request on a weekend or holiday, it will be received the next business day. How do I refill prescriptions? If your prescription is on file at a [Cleveland Clinic outpatient pharmacy](/departments/pharmacy), you can request refills through MyChart, using the same process to request a renewal. This will send the request directly to the pharmacy, and you will be contacted by phone or text message when your medication is ready for pick-up. If you are out of refills for your medication, your request will be sent to your provider for a renewal. Please note: Refills for Cleveland Clinic mail-order pharmacies cannot be requested in MyChart. Information From Other Organizations What types of information can I see from organizations outside of Cleveland Clinic? Many healthcare organizations participate in an information-sharing initiative that will allow you to view your information from other healthcare providers within your Cleveland Clinic MyChart account. - You will be able to view your medications, allergies, and health issues from other participating organizations. - You will also be able to see a list of your current physicians and providers in your Care Team. - If you have signed up for MyChart at other participating organizations, you will be able to see test results, view and send messages, and view appointments. Why don't I see information from all of my healthcare organizations? There are a few reasons why you may not see health information you expected to appear: - Not all healthcare organizations are currently participating in this information-sharing initiative. - You are not signed up for MyChart at another organization. - Having an active MyChart account with a participating organization will enable you to view additional types of information in your Cleveland Clinic MyChart account. - You did not give consent to link your accounts when prompted. - Access the Manage My Accounts section in the Profile menu, and a list of available organizations for which you have health information will display. Click \"Link\" to add the organization to your Cleveland Clinic MyChart account. Can I unlink my MyChart accounts? Yes. The Manage My Accounts section in the Profile menu allows you to link and unlink your MyChart accounts from other organizations. Updating Your Health Information How do I submit updates to my health information? To submit a request to add a new item: - Click the while in the Current Health Issues, Allergies, or Medications section. - In the search box, type in the first few words of your health issue, allergy, or medication, and click search. - Select the option from the search results that is the best fit for your individual situation. - For allergies, select all reactions that occur when you come into contact with the substance you are allergic to. - In the comment section, add details that will help your provider understand your request. For example, to add lower back pain as a problem: \"It started in 2012 after injury, tried physical therapy without success. Surgery on lower back in 2017 did not completely resolve the pain, currently treating with Tylenol which only moderately helps to decrease the pain.\" - Click Accept. To request to delete an item: - Click the minus icon next to the item you would like your provider to remove. - In the text box, please enter additional information for your provider to better understand why this health issue should be removed from your list. For example, to remove Plantar Fasciitis from your problem list: \"I was treated in 2015 with physical therapy and shoe inserts. I no longer have pain or inflammation upon walking or exercising.\" If you feel that an item was added to your record in error, please contact the Cleveland Clinic Privacy Office at 216.444.1709 or toll-free at 800.223.2273, extension 41709. What types of health issues should be included on my list? The Current Health Issues section displays what is called the \"Problem List\" in your Cleveland Clinic electronic medical record. Your Problem List contains the ongoing health issues that currently affect your well-being, and does not include temporary health concerns such as a urinary tract infection or the flu. [Find for more information on the Problem List and how your providers use this information to manage your care](https://mychart.clevelandclinic.org/public/MyClevelandClinic-Problem-List-Patient-Education.pdf) How is an allergy defined for addition to my list? Allergies are your body's reaction to a substance it views as a harmful \"invader.\" For example, coming into contact with what is normally a harmless substance, such as pollen, might cause the immune system (the body's defense system) to react. Substances that cause these reactions are called allergens. For more information: Managing Appointments Why are only a limited number of providers available when I use the Schedule My Appointment or Request an Appointment features? Schedule My Appointment enables you to view your established provider's open schedule and instantly book an appointment online. This feature is available for select specialty departments, and internal medicine, family medicine, and pediatrics. Request an Appointment is available for all departments with your established providers, and enables you to select your preferred dates and times, or request the first available appointment.
