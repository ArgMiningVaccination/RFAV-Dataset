They're fruity and booze-free\u2014what's not to love? Well, if I'm honest, I'm typically not a huge mocktail fan because they're usually just sugar bombs (there are [exceptions](https://minimalistbaker.com/sparkling-blueberry-ginger-mocktail/)). Then I thought, \"What would be something I'd actually be excited to drink if walking into a NYE party?\" Answer: Healthy shots. Call me a grandma, I don't care. That's how I roll these days. Are you with me? If yes, let's get our anti-inflammatory on. This 5-ingredient, 5-minute shot starts with a [juicer](https://minimalistbaker.com/product/juicer/). However, if you don't own a juicer fear not. You can easily blend your ingredients in a [blender](https://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QuXc1XaHrNpd9U-bVpOxk3UAAAFvJKB3lwEAAAFKAYeBmO8/https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007TIE0GQ/?creativeASIN=B007TIE0GQ&linkCode=w61&imprToken=Dtze7yzHzvprUFD4OhLfHQ&slotNum=1&tag=minimalistbaker-20) and strain for a similar effect! Lately I've been gravitating toward juice with a high vitamin C content, seeing as it's flu season. And I'm also always looking for ways to get more turmeric, ginger, and lemon into my system. Why, you ask? Turmeric contains a compound called curcumin, which boasts amazing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects ( [source](http://www.healthline.com/nutrition/top-10-evidence-based-health-benefits-of-turmeric)). And it's been used in Ayurvedic medicine for thousands of years for [conditions](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/turmeric/ataglance.htm) such as breathing problems, joint pain, fatigue, digestive issues, and more. Ginger is a natural anti-inflammatory and antioxidant that's known to aid digestion and relieve nausea. ( [source](https://draxe.com/nutrition/10-medicinal-ginger-health-benefits/)) Lemon is naturally detoxifying and alkalizing in the body, aids in healthy bowel movements, and boasts plenty of vitamin C, which boosts the immune system. ( [source](http://www.care2.com/greenliving/16-health-benefits-of-lemons.html)) And black pepper helps boost the absorption of turmeric by up to 2,000%. Yes, 2,000! ( [source](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/turmeric-and-black-pepper#active-ingredients)) We've also learned this juice is similar to a tonic called [Jamu](https://www.culturallyours.com/2020/02/21/traditional-jamu-juice-from-bali/) that has a history of use as herbal medicine in Bali. So cool! Once your juice has been extracted, it's time to add that magical black pepper to the mix and throw one (or two) back. We hope you LOVE these shots! They're: Citrusy Spicy Anti-inflammatory Vitamin C-rich Immune-boosting & Super tasty If you're into these flavors, I know you'll love these wellness shots!

NOTE: Updates made to improve blender method 1/2/19 Lemon Ginger Turmeric Wellness Shots Ingredients - 1 small orange (add 1-2 more oranges for added sweetness / omit and add another lemon for less sweetness!) - 2 small lemons (add 1-2 more lemons for more acidity / reduce by half and add another orange for less acidity!) - 1/4 cup chopped fresh turmeric (peeling optional) - 1/4 cup chopped fresh ginger (peeling optional) - 1/8 tsp fresh black pepper - 1/4 tsp oil (such as extra virgin, optional / to help improve turmeric absorption) Instructions - JUICER: To a [juicer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008RYQSL6/?tag=minimalistbaker-20), add orange, lemon, turmeric, and ginger (depending on the juicer, you may need to peel the orange and lemon - our Hurom does recommend peeling before juicing, so that's what we did). - BLENDER: Add turmeric and ginger to a [high-speed blender](https://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QjdMSSh2ihB0If1LrOJONjQAAAFvJGsYQgEAAAFKAaskUBE/https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008H4SLV6/?creativeASIN=B008H4SLV6&linkCode=w61&imprToken=1fljsCQ49EOk6Enre1pi1w&slotNum=11)or [small blender](https://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QtvoxiZDUnN58ztzp616Go0AAAFoD83QigEAAAFKAXVUE1c/https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007TIE0GQ/?creativeASIN=B007TIE0GQ&linkCode=w61&imprToken=UFo45a8x.WqB5jW64CscgQ&slotNum=0&tag=minimalistbaker-20).

Blend on high for 30 seconds. - Add a little water if it has trouble blending but you shouldn't need any. Then strain through a clean thin dish towel, small fine mesh strainer, or nut milk bag. Just be aware that turmeric can stain. - FOR SERVING: Divide between serving glasses and enjoy! For maximum benefits, enjoy immediately and top with fresh cracked black pepper. One commenter also recommended adding a little fat to improve turmeric absorption, such as olive oil! - FOR STORING: Store any leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 24 hours (though best when fresh). - LEFTOVER PULP: You can compost any leftover pulp or freeze into an ice cube try and add to future smoothies. Or, refrigerate and use to steep in "}
