It is valued highly in India as one of the country's integral spiritual herbs. Gotu Kola can be found growing naturally in some areas of the Himalayas. Yogis were among the first to employ it for meditation and yoga. Some claim it helps to strengthen the crown chakra and [balance the right and left-brain hemispheres](https://www.pharmabotanica.com.au/herb/gotu-kola/#:~:text=Growing%20in%20some%20areas%20of,leaf%20is%20said%20to%20resemble.).

The Gotu Kola herb's leaf and root both contain constituents that function. 3. Nettle Unlike Gotu kola and cannabis, Nettle is a stinging plant. It has several stinging hairs on its leaves and stems. However, after processing, it is safe to consume. Nettle is high in nutrients like vitamins A, B1, B2, B3, B5, C, and E when processed. Besides that, it is an excellent [source of minerals such as calcium and iron](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijfs/2013/857120/#:~:text=16%20May%202013-,Abstract,of%20fiber%20and%20alternative%20medicine.&text=Results%20show%20that%20processed%20nettle,calcium%2C%20iron%2C%20and%20protein.).

Taking it before your medications allows your mind to reflect on challenging life experiences. As a result, the experiences and lessons gained from these memories will help you grow. 4. Hawthorn Hawthorn is famous for its ability to strengthen the bond between the heart and the mind. It is a plant used by individuals who are in a state of grief to find solace. Hawthorn leaves were traditionally used by cultures such as Indigenous Americans and the Chinese. After a long day, meditation can be a complicated process. Throwing in Hawthorn leaves, on the other hand, can help clear your clogged mind of any bad feelings and boost your mood. You only need a few droppers of Hawthorn extract before commencing your meditation session. 5. Chamomile This is a gentle herb that is also very effective. Chamomile, like its warm nature, will help to calm and soothe you. During meditation, feelings of lethargy and racing thoughts are common. Chamomile can be an excellent catalyst for calming any grumpy emotions. To get into a meditative and relaxed state, all you have to do is take Chamomile tea.
