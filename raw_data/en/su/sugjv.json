From the beginning, Islam saw itself asa community created by God in fulfillment of God'spromise to send a prophet to every people. Muslimsbelieved that the message from God to the Arabswould be the last and most complete. Both theProphet Muhammad and the early Islamic communitybelieved that the great prophets of the past, such asAbraham and Moses, were part of its Semitic inheri-tance. Islam thus saw itself as renewing and/or bring-ing to completion a message that had previously beengiven to all other communities throughout world his-tory. Islam was therefore intricately woven into the cul- tural fabric within which Judaism and Christianityhad flourished. It quickly saw its purpose as bringingGod's true message to as many peoples as it could,resulting in the expansion of Islam throughout thethen-known world. Within two centuries of theProphet's death, Muslim empires reached from theAtlantic to the steppes of China. Faced almost immediately with a schism (circa 656) that has lasted to this day, Islam split intoSunnis and Shiites, both of whom constructed sophis-ticated spiritual versions of Islam and strove to bringa great diversity of peoples into the Muslim fold.Urged by the Qur'an to tolerate earlier forms of reli-The Islamic Tradition Religious Beliefs and Healthcare Decisions by Earle H.

Unitednot only by the impulses of state within variousempires, but by the loose control of Muslim ritu-al and Islamic law, Islam put down deep roots.Religious leadership was shaped according tosect: in Sunnism, the scholarly class, or ulama , gradually formed what has become known astraditional Sunni Islam, while in Shiism, theImams developed religious law, theology andImamate philosophy. Classical Muslim culture(c.750-950) flourished in the arts, literature,architecture, science and government. Islam grew exponentially. Various forms of piety flowered, nurtured by a highly literate cul-ture. Piety of the Qur'an, love for the Prophet,and pious attendance to God's everyday require-ments as found in the law helped shape Muslimlife. Among the most distinctive forms of pietydeveloped, Sufism was an ascetic and mysticalmovement. Reacting to the worldliness andsophistication of official Islam represented bythe courts, Sufism urged a more authentic inter-action with God through meditation and prayer.This type of piety constructed its own institu-tional orders, or tariqas , and its own spiritual leaders, known as saints. Through the mediumof Sufism, Islam became the vehicle throughwhich a myriad of believers connected to theirheartfelt spiritual urges. Islamic views of health were reflected with similar pluralism. The Islam of the court and ofdeveloping Muslim intellectual traditions adopt-ed the medical heritage of Greece, Persia, andIndia, and immediately began building uponthose traditions. In the towns and villages, whereaccess to such training was sparse, Arab folk tra-ditions held sway. These traditions blendedquickly with a wealth of popular conceptionsattributed to the Prophet. Both systems\u2014intel-lectual and folk\u2014were eventually absorbed intobasic Islamic ideology, with two ends. On onehand, physicians assumed certain moral respon-sibilities for health, along with a professionalattitude informed by pious Muslim commitment. On the other, the imposing figure of the prophetengendered a perception of good health as thelegacy of Muhammad, opening doors for every-one to seek aid to that end. With the growth ofSufism, mystical approaches to health\u2014some ofthem very old and predating the advent ofIslam\u2014came into practice. Saints, for example,were perceived as having transcendent powersby which they could influence the health ofbelievers. These beliefs flowered while restingon an essentially Muslim view of God's presencein ordinary affairs of life. Islamic culture eventually expanded into India, Indonesia, and Africa. Since classicalIslam was the most advanced culture of its day,it attracted interest just by virtue of its sophisti-cation. At the same time Islamic traditionexpanded into new areas through trade, scholar-ly ties, and movements of peoples. By the highMiddle Period (1500-1700), Islamic states weredominated by peoples of Turkic ancestry.Following the conversion of the Mongols toIslam and their advances into India, a growingIslamic internationalism linked believers in acommon religious ethos that nevertheless fos-tered distinctive regional characteristics. By the end of this period, Islam had come into increasing contact with European powers,and the ascendancy of European culture hadbegun to impact Islam dramatically. Little by lit-tle, Islamic hegemony eroded under these pres-sures until Muslims all over the world saw theirdominance fade. The Second World War led tothe rise of local Muslim nation-states whoseglobal significance paled compared to earlierglories. Reactions to this state of affairs has con-tributed significantly to the growth of\"Islamism\" (Muslim fundamentalism) today. 2Islam has no central authority. Unlike other religions, such as Roman Catholicism, a com- bination of reluctance within Islam to accepthuman mediatorship and the diversity of theIslamic community has resulted in no one offi-cial voice to express a \"universal\" Islamic opin-ion. The closest Islam has to such a voice comesfrom the ulama, who are learned in law andpublic issues and who may, if called upon, give afatwa, or opinion/rendering on an issue.However, these opinions are not always acceptedby all other authorities. Since Islam moved across nations almost from its inception, its conception of health wasinformed by many different perspectives. Not allof these perspectives have been given equalplace in the writing of histories of Islamic healthcare; rather, literary sources have often privi-leged the more formal system derived from theGreeks over other systems, such as those inher-ited from Persia and India. If we begin with the Qur'an, it is clear that health is considered one of God's blessings, forGod created humans both beautifully and in anenvironment of general well-being. Qur'an 40:64says explicitly, \"He andformed you beautifully,\" while all humans arerecognized as being children of a commonancestor, Adam. Moreover, God created eachhuman as a \"package,\" that is, each person indi-vidually is a creation of God. Human formationis comprised of a process begun in the womb,and incorporating a spiritual essence at somepoint in the process (23:13-14). Thus an indi-vidual is a \"whole\" person, integrating bothphysical and spiritual aspects without dramatic distinctions between the two. This special creation has moral significance: Through human creation, God set in place hismoral domain, making everything in the heav-ens and on earth subject to humans (31:20;16:14), and entrusting to humans from pre-eter-nity (33:72) the well-being of all beings andthings on earth (2:29). Unfortunately humanshave a very limited perspective on their respon-sibilities, and they are prone to selfishness(70:19-21). Therefore, a proper relationship withGod and concomitant attitudes of gratitude arethe ingredients for universal well-being, since itis only God that can assist humans in gettingbeyond their self-centeredness (17:100). This ethical-integrative worldview is expand- ed in several directions in the hadith , the texts that record the sayings and actions of theProphet. These sources regard health as a bless-ing from God. For example, they set out specificphysical and spiritual guidelines for cleaningoneself before prayer, practices believed to helpmaintain a well-rounded society. In general, thehadith stress that the life God gives is one toenjoy, so long as one lives within moderation.Thus personal well-being is once again elaborat-ed in terms of a well-balanced, upright stancebefore God. Vigilance becomes an ingredient,then, by which one examines one's daily experi-ence for evidence of activities and attitudesunacceptable to God. The community isenjoined to embody the same kind of religiousvision. As Islam developed, it took particular carenot to form an intermediary between human beings and God. Thus there is no rolefor a priesthood or a related institutional entityconcerned with the everyday spiritual health of the community. Instead, locally-defined authori-ty systems have evolved. These systems, whichrest on Islamic law mediated by the ulama 3 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERBELIEFS RELATING TO HEALTH CARE OVERVIEW OF RELIGIOUS MORALITY AND ETHICSand/or the imams, embrace norms held to be Islamic either because they bear the imprint ofscripture or tradition. As Sufism expanded, it,too, espoused a well-being of the whole personmediated through the saints and emphasizingpersonal spiritual achievements. At the same time, distinctive religious author- ities could and did argue for the beneficence ofillness, an argument that never became widely accepted but which nevertheless caused somepeople to inspect their lives when illness or mis-fortune occurred. This view of illness was heldprincipally by Shiites and Sufis, who evaluatedeach case personally through an inner process ofdiscovering God, and personal spiritual needs. 4 THEISLAMIC TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSTHE INDIVIDUAL AND THE PATIENT -CAREGIVER RELATIONSHIP Healing is a reflection of the message revealed in the Qur'an: \"We have revealed of the Qur'an that which is a healing and amercy for those who have faith.\" (17:82) Thus,Muslims see healing as deriving from divineintent, requiring an act of faith in God. Personalhealing is a transaction involving the divinedomain. The result is that both the caregiverand the patient operate within a conglomerate ofethical values and Islamic expectations. Theword for these ideals and behaviors is adab . Traditional adab involved both explicit normsand implicit criteria arising from social accept-ance and discourses on etiquette. In the earlyyears of Islam, when there was much diversitywithin the community, adab was very much influx. However, by the time of the Classical peri-od, a consensus or ijma, reflected what we might call a set of core values which were more or lessuniversally accepted. It is precisely during thistime that the great figures of medieval medicinewere writing their famous works, and physiciansof international stature were discoursing on therole of the doctor in society. One of the key values of this consensus was an Islamized concept of balance. OriginallyGreek ( eukrasia ), balance was energized in Islam by Qur'anic ideas of moderation and sym-metry. The ummah was a median community(2:143), and humans were created in symmetri-cal fashion (82:7) so that healing embraced aholistic model. Spiritual dimensions contributedto the healing project as much as physical ones. Both the patient and the practitioner acceptedthe spiritual agenda as critical in the healingprocess. Such a conception had a direct impact on health care providers. In general, the role ofmedical practitioners was linked to the generalbetterment of the ummah, and was understoodby them to be a special kind of responsibilityplaced upon them by God. This spiritual aspectof health care is explicitly stated by the four-teenth-century religious historian Abu 'AbdAllah Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Dhahabi: It is obligatory upon every Muslim to seek near- ness to God with whatever means possible by wayof service to Him and that he try his utmost tocarry out God's commands and ordinances. Now,after carrying out specific religious rites anddesisting from actions He has prohibited, the mostbeneficial means and the most helpful service ren-dered to God is that which benefits man in pre-serving his health and in curing his illness, sincehealth is something Muslims are asked to pray foreven in their ritual prayers. 1 Such views derive from a symbiosis between the work of the medical person and God. Al-Ruhawi, a ninth century author, wrote in hisbook on medical ethics: \"The philosopher canonly improve the soul but the virtuous physiciancan improve both body and soul. The physicianTHEPARKRIDGE CENTERdeserves the claim that he is imitating the acts of God the Exalted as much as he can.\"2 The patient came to rely on this sense of pub- lic welfare in relations with health care special-ists. If the patient was poor it was understoodthat the physician would charge the wealthy.Differential fees, then, would make up for thosewho could not pay, and the charity involved wasconsidered a responsibility laid upon those whocould handle it by God. This sense of a just,charitable community soon expressed itself inthe growth of clinics and hospitals, which wereendowed by wealthy individuals or by royalpatronage as an expression of moral commit-ment for the benefit of the indigent. The com-munity rewarded these benefactors by accordingthem prestige and broadcasting widely theirMuslim piety. Thus, health care evolved out ofIslamic values and spawned a distinctive set ofmoral concerns that led to institutions for thepublic good. Eventually, these institutions builtattached facilities for young medical trainees,along with schools and libraries dedicated to awide range of medical purposes. In so doing, itingrained the principle of health service as anexpression of Islamic piety that undergirded thewhole medical system in Islam. CCLLIINNIICCAALLIISSSSUUEESS Self-determination and informed consent As we have seen, Muslim adab incorporated per- sonal faith directly into the healing process and,since each person was a unique creation, eachwas held responsible under God for personalhealth achievements. This meant that everypatient had the right to judge the effectivenessof all treatments. Indeed, each person's spiritualstate was to be a factor in choosing treatments.In Classical Islam, the patient had three options:the biomedical physician, whose knowledge wasbuilt upon Greek origins; Prophetic medicine,founded upon practices attributed to theProphet; and special blessings and healingderived from the baraka (special beneficiences)of the local Shaykh of the Sufi tariqa (mystical order). While tensions existed between these sys-tems, no one was considered superior since eachmore or less fit within the ethical-integrativebedrock of Islam. Ultimately, then, the onus forany cure did not rest upon the healing profes-sion, but on the patient's personal choice, andeven his or her personal destiny. Thus, patientsfollowed irregular paths when confronted withillness. They might not begin with the physician,but with a local scholar versed in the proscrip-tions given in the Prophet's traditions. Or theymight begin with the head of the local Sufigroup. The decision often depended on wherethey put the greatest confidence or had the easi-est, most affordable access. Physicians acceptedthis kind of self-determination and worked with-in it\u2014especially since they accepted that theirknowledge was limited. Moreover, classical Islamrequired that the patient know the specifics ofhis or her case, since health and well-being werereligious issues thought eventually to bring theperson into discourse with God. Once the illnessbecame life-threatening, health care became adialogue between the person and God. Islam today thus recognizes that the question of destiny militates against the physician inter-posing his or her views between that of God'splan for the person and the individual. Thisprinciple requires full disclosure, insofar as thatis possible. It also recognizes that gaining newknowledge is a command of the Qur'an (\"Seekknowledge even unto the ends of the earth\")and that gaining this knowledge will eventuallyrequire human experimentation. But there areconditions: one cannot approve experimentationthat reduces the individual to less than the basicperson that he or she is; one cannot approveexperimentation that has no obvious benefit tohuman life; one cannot approve experimentationthat could cut short an individual's life; onecannot participate in experimentation that blursthe line between humans and animals in anyfundamental sense. 5THEISLAMIC TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSExperimentation on Human Embryos In the Muslim world, an embryo does not become human until ensoulment takes place,considered to occur after completion of thefourth month of pregnancy. The view isexpressed by Mahmud Zayid: With regard to the question of induced abortion, Muslim scholars, both classical and modern, makea distinction between two stages in the pregnancydivided by the end of the fourth month (120days), with all holding the view that abortionshould not take place during the second stage. 3 Indeed, there is real question as to whether one can call the object that exists before ensoul-ment \"an embryo.\" Since what exists, however,is not considered a person, experimentation isallowed, so long as it takes place before thefour-month limit. Some Sunni jurists, notablyAbu Hamid Muhammad al-Ghazali, argue thataborting a fetus after the fourth month is a mor-tal sin equivalent to murder. Claims against theoffending party could result in ransom, fines,and/or expiation payments. Some Shiite jurists,however, would hold that aborting a fetus beforethat date is also subject to expiation payments. Nevertheless Islamic law would appear to be on the side of experimentation, within theparameters outlined. There is no legal teachingagainst creating embryos in vitro, nor againsttesting for scientific purposes. Nor is there anyparticular method of disposal after abortion,since the fetus is considered equal to other mat-ter. Nevertheless, some jurists would argueagainst aborting pre-ensouled embryos purelyfor experimentation, and thus might be morepredisposed to testing laboratory-developedfetuses than naturally gestated fetuses. The sameposition applies to the use of tissue for thera-peutic or experimental purposes. Truth-telling and confidentiality Muslim perceptions of duty are defined by theQur'an's injunction: \"May you form a nation ofthose who summon to blessing, who commandwhat is good and forbid what is evil.\" (3:104) Promoting a just social order is therefore a basicprinciple that is enshrined in Muslim law. Anyethical theory must ultimately be measuredagainst its ability to promote the true purpose ofthe community, that is, the fulfillment ofshari'ah . Ibn Taymiyyah (d.1328) is typical of conservative views on the inter-relationshipbetween duty and shari'ah: In considering the scope of what is good and what is evil the criteria of the Divine Law must beapplied. As long as man is able to submit to thetexts of the law, he must not deviate from them. If,however, there is no specific text to apply in a par-ticular circumstance, let him carefully compare hisopinion with possible analogies and similar cases.It is rare that the texts will be found inadequate,providing the person is well-acquainted with themand with their capacity to guide him to wise judg-ments. 4 Truth-telling in Islam has therefore always been linked to the community's law; one tellsthe truth because one belongs to God's commu-nity, which promotes the good. In health mat-ters, the onus shifts from truth-telling for its ownsake to truth-telling as a command for thegood\u2014a significant difference when one is adju-dicating \"the good\" to a person, a family, or theMuslim community. In Islamic legal terms, thefocus must be on the community's good in thelargest sense. Thus, one need not tell the indi-vidual that she is dying\u2014first because God hascontrol of that fact and, second, because know-ing this may not provide a greater good to thecommunity. Indeed, it may provoke much evil.Where good and evil are intermingled, the pathwith the greatest potential spiritual good to thecommunity is to be followed. The rights of theindividual are clearly subservient to that of thecommunity in such a scenario. Confidentiality, too, must be subject to the same goals. However, the rights of the individualare to be breached in the circumstance wheresilence will not bring good to the Muslim com- 6munity. For example, a person's HIV-positive status should be made known to the communitysince that community's health will be jeopard-ized if it remains ignorant of the fact. It is theperson's responsibility as a member of the com-munity to disclose the facts in the least problem-atic way. Normally, the family of the patient willundertake the disclosure in a manner least dam-aging to the person. In this case, the individual'sright to confidentiality is overridden by the ruleof commanding the most good. Proxy decision-making and advance directives In Islam, proxy is intimately related to authority, and from the standpoint of a person, the mostimmediately identifiable authority is the family.The family unit, to be further discussed in thenext section, has the ultimate warrant of hadithand shari'ah. 'Abd al-'Ati has observed: Islam seems to insist that the foundation of the family should rest on solid grounds capable ofproviding assurances of continuity, security andintimacy, and of being, as much as possible, \"nat-ural,\" mutually binding, and gratifying. Accordingly Islam recognizes only blood tiesand/or marital bonds as the rule foundation of thefamily. There is no more natural relationship thanthat of blood. 5 Such an insistence on the cohesiveness of the blood family means that decision-making mustfall upon the family as a unit; that is, no organi-zation outside the family should have theauthority to rule on an individual family mem-ber's well being. Nor can one person within theunit have the authority to transcend the will ofthe group. Legally family members can statewhat another member would want in lieu of thatperson's opinion. Thus the family has full andlegal authority within Islam to provide proxy. Moreover, since families are complex organ- isms, one individual cannot be designated totake advance directives, because that vitiates thefamily to interpret a particular directive. Hence,Muslim advance directives have to be given tothe family as a whole if it is to enjoy the force oflaw within Islam. Islam essentially recognizes sex as a given inthe order of things: \"We have created every- thing in pairs,\" the Qur'an says. Intolerable,however, is sex not set within a framework andcontrolled for the betterment of society. Thus,where pre-Islamic Arabia allowed the consort ofmen and women outside of wedlock, the Qur'ancurbed these excesses by instituting marriage forall. Thus male-female marriage is the normexpected in Muslim communities, and producingoffspring became a critical ingredient in Muslimsocial order. Women's needs for sexual fulfillment are fully recognized in the Qur'an. The Prophet granted adivorce to a woman who complained that herhusband was impotent. Moreover, sexuality is considered so important that it continues intothe next life, symbolically expressed by thebeautiful houris, or maidens, who live with the believers in paradise. There are also a significantnumber of hadith indicating that love-makingwith one's mate is both pleasant and religiouslymeritorious. While the Qur'an is written from amale perspective that \"Women are a tilth foryou, so approach your tilth in whatever way youlike\"(2:223), the meaning for most commenta-tors is the mutual joys of love-making, that Godsees nothing wrong with a robust sex life so longas the reproductive dimension within marriageremains paramount. In addition, sexual equality 7 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERFAMILY , SEXUALITY , AND PROCREATIONTHEISLAMIC TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSfor all wives is fully recognized and legally defined within the Holy book. CCLLIINNIICCAALLIISSSSUUEESS Contraception Coitus interruptus was known and practiced at the time of the Prophet, and statements attrib-uted to him indicate that he accepted it. In hisevaluation of contradictory hadith on the topic,Fazlur Rahman concluded that contraceptioncould be allowed \"if it is called for,\" that is, ifthere are good reasons why it should be prac-ticed. One such reason is if a child is still suck-ling. Generally speaking, however, there hasbeen some resistance from Muslims in adoptingcontraception, especially because the Prophetwas said to have wanted to be proud of thenumber of Muslims at the Day of Resurrection:\"So reproduce and increase in numbers.\" 6 The Shafi'i school of law allows the husband to use contraception even without his wife'sconsent; Zahiri lawyers absolutely forbade it.Ghazali, a great jurist and Sufi theoretician,argued that the pious person who had achieveda special state of trust in God could not use con-traception because he enjoyed the highest spiri-tual state of trust and could thus base his sexualfulfillment on knowing the will of God. However,since few people ever achieved this level of spir-ituality, they could use contraception. Moreover,Ghazali held that if the birth of children wouldpotentially push the husband to illicit meansjust to feed them, then contraception would beallowed. Economic arguments similar to this hadbeen used by most Islamic governments toencourage official government policy in familyplanning, but with the rise of powerful conserva-tive elements, such as the Muslim Brotherhoodand Khomeini's revolution, such contentionsface powerful opposition. Since population con-trol is a concept developed in the West, it iswidely regarded as a subtle form of Westernimperialism and governments have shifted thethrust of the argument toward family pacing andindividual family planning, away from official policy. Men are ordered in the Qur'an (2:223) to \"stay away from\" wives during menstruation.This is interpreted to mean refraining from sex-ual intercourse, but there are no penalties otherthan repentance for breaking this prohibition.Similarly, masturbation is frowned upon underthe law, not for religious reasons but because itwas once widely regarded as leading to impo-tence. Homosexuality is condemned in theQur'an through the story about the people ofLot, who were destroyed because of it. Still, theQur'an is not clear about the penalty forinfringement of this prohibition. Most legistsregard it as equivalent to illicit heterosexualintercourse. Islam affirms the model of the heterosexual family, regards procreation as the central pur-pose of that unit, and resists any interventionthat would destroy that ability. (The prohibitiondid not apply to slaves, as the eunuchs in theharems demonstrate). Both male and femalesterilization are regarded as contrary to religiousrequirements. However, if it occurs as a result oflife-saving procedures, as in a hysterectomyrequired to avoid the spread of cancer, the high-er principle of life warrants the outcome. Eventhose who favor the use of contraceptives, how-ever, reject the procedures of tubal ligation andvasectomy as means of population controlbecause of their permanent thwarting of procre-ation. 8THEPARKRIDGE CENTERArtificial Insemination Given the central place of the family unit in Islam, artificial insemination is allowed provided that it promotes the family. The proce-dure should not, however, replace the normalconjugal method of procreation, and should onlybe used if the male has been injured in someway to render that method impossible. On the other hand, should the woman be unable to conceive because she cannot producean egg, Islamic authorities have accepted HIA,or Heterologous Artificial Insemination, as acredible alternative because half of the requiredelements for generating life comes from one ofthe married partners. The procedure can takeplace, because Islam does not hold that thefetus has personhood until ensoulment takesplace. Anything of human agency can be per-formed before that moment to make ensoulmentpossible. Since ensoulment is God's process forcreating a unique human, procedures paving theway for that possibility may be justifiably taken. However, where both sperm and egg are donor produced, issues of blood line are raised.Claims that a child of such a union is not eligi-ble for the legal benefits attending a \"true\" childmay apply. Such problems do not exist if theinsemination is homologous, i.e. from the hus-band and wife. This issue is somewhat modifiedby the Islamic law of acknowledgment of parent-hood. A hadith stating that the \"child belongs tothe matrimonial bed,\" affirms that all offspringconceived through cohabitation husbandand wife \"belong\" to the couple. Gamete Intrauterine Fallopian Transfer (GIFT) No official statement is available on this method. However, since this procedure is based on assist-ing the normal processes of fertilization throughstimulation of the ovaries and placing the result-ing eggs together with sperm back into the fal-lopian tubes, it would not appear to contradictreligious teaching. The procedure is widely usedin Saudi Arabia, where jurists have supported the birth of test-tube babies to childless parentsand recognized the trauma that childless womenhave faced after their husbands replaced themwith fertile mates. 7 In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) Since a child is not born unless a fetus becomesensouled there seems to be no official restrictionagainst IVF. Rather, it is regarded as a positiveapplication of medical understanding to familymaintenance. Likewise, no teaching prohibitsthe disposal of fertilized eggs. However, if theprocedure circumvents the Islamic definition offamily by, for example, placing the fertilized eggin a single woman, a different set of issues areraised. These have to do with the Islamic senseof honor ( ird) deriving from pre-Islamic tribal codes. An act which dishonors is regarded asseverely punishable, and a woman who carries achild outside of wedlock, unless she is a slavewoman, will be harshly punished for dishonor-ing the Muslim concept of family. The issue isthe supposed adultery of the single woman.Hathout contends that while sperm and eggdonations cannot be judged adulterous, a num-ber of other legal and social issues militateagainst such donations\u2014namely, inheritance lawsand increased risk of unintended incest withinthe community. 8 Surrogate motherhood Some Muslim jurists decry any attempt to bypassthe physical infirmities of either partner by thiscontractual arrangement, arguing that God is thegiver of children, and that human interventionto circumvent physical limitations is tantamountto usurping God's jurisdiction. The Qur'anseems to affirm this when it says: \"He bestowsboth males and females (i.e. children) and Heleaves barren whom He will.\" (42:49-50) SomeIslamic scholars have argued vigorously againstall fertility intervention on grounds that itdestroys the surrogate mother's connection to 9NEW REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGIESTHEISLAMIC TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSparenting responsibilities.9The oft-quoted saying of the Prophet that \"paradise is under the feet ofyour mother\" indicates to many Muslims thevalue the Prophet placed on conventional moth-erhood. In addition, surrogate mothers face a legal precedent which holds that any woman whobears a child out of wedlock is immediately sub-ject to an accusation of adultery. Islamic law hasestablished very strong laws against both forni-cation and adultery, with the penalty for the for-mer being one hundred lashes and the latterstoning to death. Further complicating the situa-tion is the status of the child, since there weremany examples of children born to slave womenin classical Islam. Slave children did not havethe same rights as \"children of the matrimonialbed\" but instead were regarded as the mother'schildren. Islam also forbids formal adoptionsince the Qur'an insists that children carry theirown names. (33:4-5) Clearly, the relationship ofthe surrogate to the child would also become afactor, since the Qur'an indicates directly thatwhoever carries the child in her womb is themother (31:14). In Islamic terms, surrogacy ispossible only through marriage, and, since ahusband may legally have up to four wives, theproblem could be solved with a legal marriagebetween the surrogate mother and the maledonor. The Shiite acceptance of mut'a marriage (marriage contracted for a given length of time)makes this more legally accessible. Throughout Islamic history, however, another type of surrogacy has been widely accepted: thatof a milk-mother. Under this arrangement, thechild may be cared for, breast-fed, and even dis-ciplined by someone other than the biologicalmother. The contractual nature of this practiceis sanctioned by the Qur'an, and hence could bethe basis for the contractual dimension of surro-gacy. Abortion Islam does not have a uniform definition of thefetus. Some scholars hold that the word janin or \"that which is veiled or covered\" refers to theprocreated being in the womb (53:32), while others believe that the Qur'an insists on anensoulment process (23:13) that occurs eitherforty or 120 gestation days (depending on theschool of law) after fertilization. 10All schools of Islamic law are uniform in their condemnationof abortion once ensoulment has taken place.The lack of clarity on the timing of ensoulment,however, has resulted in severe restrictions onabortion. A number of legal reasons have alsocontributed to these restrictions. First, life is considered a sacred gift from God which no human has the right to rescind. (4:93)Second, all schools of Muslim law recognizefetal rights. Thus, if a mother has been sen-tenced to death, the penalty cannot be carriedout until the child she is carrying has been bornand properly cared for by a milk-mother.Moreover, the fetus can legally inherit, and thelaw stipulates that inheritance decisions mustwait until after birth. Finally, stillborn or miscar-ried fetuses must be given burial. 11 Prenatal diagnosis and treatment Modern technology now allows for screeningbased on processes such as amniocentesis,processes that propose interference with thenormal gestation of the fetus. Such interferenceis subject to the same restrictions as abortion: aslong as the procedure takes place before ensoul-ment, interference is legal though perhaps prob-lematic. Malformed fetuses may thus be legallyaborted within the set gestation period; beyondthat there are clear legal barriers. Building onthese notions, then, in utero surgery wouldappear to be a legitimate health procedure froman Islamic perspective. Care of severely handicapped newborns Islamic commitment to the uniqueness of eachindividual resists any interference in the normalgrowth of a person. Where it is obvious that theindividual will survive only with extraordinaryassistance, the legal issues are not so clear. Islamencompasses a strong sense of destiny, andinterference in a person's natural development 10must be tempered by an awareness that life ulti- mately belongs to God. On the other hand, onceborn and surviving, the newborn is considered ahuman being and must be accorded the rightsof all humans. Once again, the critical role ofthe family becomes evident here, for both theamount of intervention and its appropriatenessare matters very much in the family's hands.They, too, are acutely aware of the overridingcontrol that God has in matters of life anddeath. Where resources are scarce these mattersseem already decided, since the availability oftechnical assistance is seen to be beyond the family's prerogatives, and thus in the hands ofGod. Islam generally would not promote major'heroic' intervention in a severely handicappednewborn's life, since this seems to skew thesense of balance essential to the Muslim world-view. On the other hand, it would not promote aregimen designed to terminate the child's lifeeither, for that would violate God's will asexpressed in the life processes of the newborn. As indicated above, contemporary geneticshas received positive responses in Muslim legal opinions in Saudi Arabia. Given its focuson improvement of human life, genetics is easilyaccommodated within Muslim legal and socialopinion. Islam has accepted physical limitationsas a normal part of the social order: the blind,for example, have been directed into activities ofcommunity value, such as Qur'an reciting andstorytelling, while those with other disabilitiesare accepted as recipients of zakat (alms) based on Qur'anic dictums. What Islamic legal opinionand religious doctrine stands against is anyprocess that interjects human manipulation intocreation. Thus, while Muslim law generallywould condone procedures that make humanlife better able to serve God and community, itwould resist those like cloning that cross theline between natural, God-sanctioned activityand human-directed creation/manipulation. CCLLIINNIICCAALLIISSSSUUEESS Genetic screening and counseling In the light of the fact that Muslim marriage is a contract between two parties\u2014a contract thatrequires the commitment of family resources forthe mutual sustenance of the couple and the long-standing principle of negotiating terms forthe union\u2014genetic screening is not necessarilyseen as a foreign imposition. Traditionally, oneof the many social factors taken into considera-tion during mate negotiations was the potentialto have healthy children. There is thus no seri-ous legal impediment to the adoption of geneticscreening in Islam. Where the screening is inva-sive, however, and interferes with the legitimateright of the couple to have children, Islamic lawwould reject it. Major concerns about the poten-tial impact of an individual's disease on thecommunity at large, however, would supersedethe individual's rights not to be screened. Onthe other hand, in one hadith, the Prophetexplicitly denies a Bedouin the right to reject achild who has been born to his wife because,the Bedouin says, the child is a black boy. TheProphet indicates that since the Bedouin cannotpredict the color of his camels, he can hardlypredict from which ancient ancestor the childderived his color. We now can recognize genelatency as the possible cause for the child's skincolor. 12The hadith also seems to support the view that screening cannot be done on racial orcolor bases. 11 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERGENETICSSex selection Prenatal diagnosis has no precursor per se in either the Qur'an or the hadith. However, prin-ciples taken from these sources seem to militateagainst sex selection: female children are not tobe exposed, as they were in pre-Islamic Arabia,because of their equal value before God. (16:59-61; 17:33) This passage seems to affirm thatboth sexes have an equal right to life, and thatthere can be no arbitrary termination of a fetuson the grounds of gender. Of course, local loreabout determining the sex of the child aboundsin Muslim communities, and some ethnic com-munities have a clear preference for sons.Officially, however, Islam would reject anymanipulation on the basis of gender. Selective abortion Outside of the bounds discussed above, abortionmay take place only if the mother's life is threat-ened by carrying the fetus to term. In Islam, anexisting human life takes precedence over whatis not yet a human life. Case in point: theremoval of a cancerous uterus during the gesta-tion period. If the outcome of the operation is indoubt, or if the prognosis for the mother isunclear, the abortion may not take place. On theother hand, the Shafi'i school teaches that if apregnant woman dies, the fetus should beremoved from her body in order to have achance to survive. In cases where the fetus was deemed not able to survive birth, where the woman is too smallto give birth, or where the fetus is the result ofrape, classical Islamic physicians like al-Razi orIbn Sina have accepted abortion for medical reasons. Their arguments arise from an aware-ness of complex situations and reflect a judi-cious balance of medical wisdom and sensitivityto Islamic doctrine. Gene therapy Therapeutic surgery, either intrauterine or short-ly after birth, is completely within Islam's man-date of medical interference for positive healthreasons. Surgery to alleviate chromosomal dis-eases before birth would be regarded as equiva-lent to surgery to repair a blocked artery afterbirth. Non-therapeutic intervention is warrantedas long as its outcome \"commands the good.\"However, regarding the use of gene therapy toproduce human-type beings for therapeutic pur-poses, Islam's affirmation of the individual'suniqueness before God would be a restraint. Cloning Cloning has raised critical issues for the Muslimworld. On the one hand, cloning creates thepotential of a disease-free individual, whichwould reside within the \"commanding the good\"parameter. On the other hand, cloning implieshuman manipulation of the creative process, amanipulation on such a scale that it destroys theline between legitimate medical intervention andGod's creative hegemony. While opinion is ini-tially negative on this matter, Muslimresearchers and scholars have not yet given theproblem an in-depth critical assessment. Organ transplants raise some fundamentalquestions for Muslims. Because Islam makes no clear distinction between body andsoul, or body and mind, the cohesiveness of theperson involves retaining the body's configura-tion as a unity. Thus deliberately giving away part of one's gift from God has significant theo-logical implications. On the other hand, familyresponsibilities are so significant in Islam thatgiving a relative a needed organ would be seen 12 THEISLAMIC TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSORGAN AND TISSUE TRANSPLANTATIONas a duty. Where the gift could make a differ- ence between life and death, one body's cohe-sion would be considered less important thansaving a life. In determining whether a trans-plant is right or wrong, the operative issue isresponsibility to one's family and community.Committing oneself to doing what is right forthe community is seen as a powerful vehicle formoral activity. CCLLIINNIICCAALLIISSSSUUEESS Issues concerning recipients The Muslim conception of the inextricable rela- tionship between a whole person and their phys-ical body raises some ethical issues for recipi-ents. How much influence will the donor's organhave in the mental and spiritual development ofthe recipient? While a recipient may feel realgratitude for the transplant, his or her bodilyintegrity has been disturbed. Moreover, therecipient becomes socially indebted\u2014and thisindebtedness may extend beyond the recipientto his or her family and associates. In 1979, thescholar and jurist Gad al-Haqq of al-Azhar, thefamous Egyptian school, gave a fatwa on organtransplants to the effect that they are permissi-ble from a living donor provided the transplantis needed, there is no harm to the donor, andthat there is a strong prognosis for success. Al-Haqq also stated that the donor should notreceive any funds for the organ. 13Issues concerning donors Muslims participate in the ummah, or the com-munity, most intimately through their family.The giving of an organ, such as a kidney, to arelative is considered a legitimate invasion ofone's unity for the larger good of the ummah.The transplanting of hearts, for example raisessome basic questions: Will the donor be an inte-gral whole, that is, a complete body and soul, atJudgment Day? What is the relationship betweenthe character of the person and the part that isdonated? Is the donor \"whole\" when she/hestands before God? These problems suggest thatIslam wrestles with questions of severing theperson from the body more than Western reli-gious traditions do. Clearly Islam does not condone the taking of organs if it results in the death of the donorindividual. Most body parts, however, come fromcadavers, and Islam has traditionally insisted onthe dignity of the dead and the religiousrequirement that persons be properly rituallyburied. Should there be such a donation, there-fore, the family must unequivocally give permis-sion. The theological suggestion that one mustbe whole before God will thus act as a restrainton the free donation of organs. Finally, Islam is absolutely opposed to the sale of organs. To do so would be to remove thepersonhood of the individual from the body,regardless of which part it might be, turning itinto a mere physical object. The reduction of thebody to such an object is rejected uniformly byall Muslim jurists and medical practitioners. Islam has been a leader in the treatment of thementally disturbed. Very early in Muslim histo- ry, hospitals were established for the expresspurpose of dealing with the mentally ill; a docu-ment from the famous Mansuri (eleventh centu-ry) in Egypt explicitly states: \"The foremostattention (in law) is to be paid to those who have suffered loss of mind and hence loss ofhonor.\" 14 To such effect, Muslims used therapies such as music far ahead of the rest of the world.Moreover, mental illness seems to have beenone area specifically demanding beneficence to 13 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERMENTAL HEALTHTHEISLAMIC TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSthe poor and a measure of a ruler's reflection of God's generosity. Some sanitoriums were housedin palaces and were richly appointed. Thus,Islam has long conceived that persons sufferingfrom mental illness are no less of value thanother humans, and must be treated as such.Moreover, Muslim society recognized variouskinds of mental illness, including a \"madness\"associated with love. CCLLIINNIICCAALLIISSSSUUEESS Involuntary commitment Islamic tradition accepts that certain kinds of mental illness will require that a person's free-dom be curtailed for the good of the person andfor the community, but it also recognizes thatthis restraint should be subservient to theintegrity of the person within society. TheQur'an itself recognizes conditions that tran-scend the family: \"On no soul does Allah placea burden greater than it can bear; it gets everygood that it earns and it suffers every ill that itearns.\" (2:286) Interestingly, facilities thathoused the ill along with the family prevailed, sothat the social cohesion of life remained intact.Moreover, no treatment was to rob a Muslim'sbasic legal right to a sound mind. 15Thus thera- pies were first subject to the needs of the per-son, second to the acknowledged participation ofthe family, and third to the needs of Islamic law.All life, including one's own life, belonged ulti-mately to God. Persons in authority, such asdoctors or scholars, were judged to have the cor-rect perspective on Islamic law and could act asmediators between the individual and the com-munity. Hence the relationship between thehealth institution, the law, and the individual isdifferent in classical Islam than in the West, oreven in Muslim nations today. The very conceptof \"involuntary\" arises from a western notion ofseparate self. Islam did not propound such aview, and therefore treatment of the mentally illdid not operate with the same set of concerns. Psychotherapy, behavior modification, and psychopharmacology In classical Islamic times, all treatments, drugs and food were free at hospitals. All manner oftreatments were offered: drugs and chemicals,baths and salves, music and prayers. Both maleand female caregivers treated the ill. Hence, theIslamic propensity to use a variety of therapiesto cure mental illness has a long and distin-guished history. It goes without saying that thehead of these hospitals must have had the high-est sense of moral purpose, for their service wasoften paid for by the sultan or caliph as anextension of the ruler's piety, so that a therapy'suse would not be manipulated by cost factors.Thus, modern multidimensional therapies havesignificant antecedents in the medieval Muslimcommunity. Electroshock and stimulation The philosophy of Islamic mental treatment wasnot based on the pragmatism of containment,but on the pious expression of charity to a per-son considered out of balance; Islam thereforeaccepted a wide range of techniques for return-ing the person to wholeness. Modification of theperson's present state of illness was accepted asa normal result of medical intervention. Hence,electroshock treatments and the behavior modi-fication attendant upon such occurrences fallwithin the parameters sketched by classicalIslamic medicine. Since families often played acaregiving role in these hospitals, the issue ofinformed consent was based not on a model ofthe individual, but a social model. While Islamicmental treatments today have moved toward anindividualist model, electroshock would only beused if relatives were aware of the possible out-comes. Such interventions raise issues aboutpersonality modification, which many Muslimsregard as verging on the creation of another per-sonality. Such intervention would not, therefore,be given high priority in the effort to return theperson to balance. 14THEPARKRIDGE CENTERThe Qur'an is forthright about death as a major passage to another life. In Islam, it is not quite true to say that death is the cessationof life, but rather, that the life one receives atbirth is preparatory for the life after death. InQur'an 23:12-16, a description for the develop-ment of a new human being is followed immedi-ately by: \"After this you will surely die, and onthe Day of Resurrection you will surely be raisedup.\" Being born, then, is linked to dying andboth are connected to resurrection. Still, theQur'an does not present a fully constructed planof creation, death, and afterlife. That elaborationarose when theologians and commentators wererequired to sketch the details of post-life exis-tence in doctrine. The exegete al-Samarqandioffers this outline for a believer: 1. When the person is about to die, two white-faced angels come to sit on either side, while the Angelof Death arrives immediately before death andtakes the soul. 2. The soul is then presented to the two angels who wrap it in a sweet-smelling shroud and take it tothe seventh heaven. 3. There the record of the soul is written. . . following which it is returned to the body in the grave. There it undergoes the questioning by theangels Munkar and Nakir. 4. Correct answers trigger a trumpet sound from a messenger who proclaims that the answers indi-cate a believer and that the blessings and pleas-ures of the Garden are available to the person inthe grave. 16 Traditionally, a Muslim does not die alone, segregated from relatives or friends. Islam iswell-known for its revulsion of any form ofmediation between God and human, but theemphasis on community means that a supportnetwork surrounds the dying at the decisivemoment. They can, for example, help the personas she/he recites the required confession offaith: \"There is no god but God, andMuhammad is His messenger.\" Equally impor- tant, if the dying person has done some wrong toanyone, Islam requires that the wrong be forgiv-en lest the dying not be forgiven by God. In both the Qur'an and in popular belief, unbelievers are said to face a very bleak death,and that moment of dying can be a portend offuture torture in the grave. Because of suchimplications, Muslims pray earnestly for an\"easy\" death. CCLLIINNIICCAALLIISSSSUUEESS Determining death Given the need to recite a confession before death, Islam stresses the importance of retainingconsciousness until this has been accomplished.The Qur'an is unclear about whether the body\"dies\" when the soul is removed by the Angel ofDeath, since it does not favor the Greek-inspiredmind-body dualism of the person's makeup.Rather, death is most analogous to sleep;indeed, Rahman contends that \"sleep is a sort oflesser death.\" 17The Muslim view is thus compli- cated by the belief that the life principle residesin God's hands and the absence of it cannot beestablished just through a lack of brain-waveactivity. From a religious point of view, mechanical intervention at the time of death is of limitedvalue, since death is considered a moment ofdestiny involving supernatural forces. However,in 1986, the International Collective of IslamicJurists of the Organization of IslamicConference rendered an opinion in Amman,Jordan, saying that an individual would be con-sidered dead in either of the following situa-tions: 1. If the heart and breath stop completely,and the physicians are convinced that this con-dition is irreversible; 2. If all the mental func-tions of the mind have ceased, and the physi-cians decide such a condition is irreversible. Ineither of these scenarios, it is legitimate to dis- 15DEATH AND DYINGTHEISLAMIC TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSengage all machines, even if some parts of the body are still functioning with their assistance. Itis also legitimate to stop all medical interven-tion. While these guidelines carefully definedeath, they have also validated decisions tomaintain people who are brain dead on life sup-port systems, since such sustenance allows thephysician to keep the person alive until bodyparts can be harvested. The justification for thismodification of the body's integrity is the\"greater good\" of the community. Saudi Arabiahas become a leader in this field in the Muslimworld. 18 As in many traditions, Islam has retained notions of death and dying that cannot be foundin any of its sacred sources. Dying while on thepilgrimmage to Mecca is considered particularlymeritorious, and many severely ill people makeevery effort to go on pilgrimage in anticipationof death. Dying during Ramadan is also consid-ered more significant than at other times. Suchtiming can impact directly on Muslim attitudestowards medical interventions. Pain control and palliative care According to one hadith, the Prophet said: \"Ifind it strange on the part of a man of faith thathe should grieve at his ailment; if he knew what(goodness) is in his illness, he would love to beill until he meets his Lord.\" 19At the same time there is a hadith that implies a different reading:\"There are some of God's people whom Godcarefully saves from being killed and from ill-ness; He causes them to live in health and todie in health and bestows upon them the honorof martyrs.\" 20Whatever else can be said about illness and pain, Islam interprets it to be part ofthe interaction between humans and God. Thus,for example, al-Dhahabi holds that prayers canalleviate pains in the heart, stomach and intes-tines. 21In general, the Qur'an insists that people not be required to deal with more than they canbear. Historically, Islam has advocated a systemof pain control that does not render one uncon-scious, in light of the obligations required atdeath.We have seen that classical Muslim society regarded the funding of health care as a respon-sibility of the pious ruler before God. The socialfabric of Muslim culture fully supports contem-porary palliative movements, provided they con-tinue to encourage the dying person's interac-tion with family and friends. Foregoing life-sustaining treatment The general thrust of Muslim belief is that thecommunity must sustain an individual until it isobvious that the believer must face God.Prolonging that moment will serve no religiouspurpose. Intravenous feeding for the sole pur-pose of sustaining the mechanical functions ofthe body runs counter to Islamic notions ofdeath; likewise, the withdrawal of hydrationneed not be considered the cause: God deter-mines the moment of death. Therefore, heroic measures must be tempered by religious awareness. Ultimately Muslimsbelieve medicine cannot change the destiny ofthe human, and attempts to bypass theinevitable may be interpreted as an obvious lackof trust in God. Rabi'ah al-'Adawiyya, thefamous saint, was visited by a friend while shewas ill. He urged her to pray that God relieveher suffering. Her reply was: \"O Sufyan! do younot know who has willed my suffering? Is it notGod? Why do you ask me to pray for what con-tradicts his will.\" 22The fundamental Muslim position is instilled by Qur'an 4:71,102, \"Takeyour guard against peril,\" a position that adjuresthe believer to do what one can legitimately doto prevent suffering, and then to exercise trustthat God will work out His will. This processwas never interpreted to involve heroics, for thatvitiated trust in God. Artificially administerednutrition or extraordinary interventions havespiritual ramifications that cannot be ignored bythe believer. Medical interventions must be sub-ject to the person's ongoing dialogue with God. Suicide, assisted suicide, and active voluntary euthanasia Neither the Qur'an nor the hadith speak about 16suicide. However, some see 2:195 of the Qur'an as prohibiting it: \"Do not cast yourselves intodestruction.\" Since Islam has stressed the conti-nuity of life beyond the grave and the jurisdic-tion of God over life and death, inflicting deathupon oneself is seen only to compound theproblems faced in the next life. Islam thus strongly resists assisted suicide. Taking a life is deemed tantamount to usurpingGod's role, and this is a heresy of intense con-demnation justified only when one is involved injihad, \"fighting in the path of Allah.\" Muslims also strongly resist active voluntary euthanasia. For similar reasons, they believe thatGod will not burden a person beyond what theycan bear. (2:286) However, if a burden doesbecome unbearable, then the community's roleis to help alleviate it, but not by killing the indi-vidual. A very fine line is walked in this regard. Autopsy and postmortem Islam contends that the body belongs to Godand should not be mutilated. Upon a person'sdeath, the family is required to wash the dead,wrap the body in a shroud, and immediatelyprepare to carry the deceased to the grave. Noneof the elaborate postmortem procedures prac-ticed in the West are accepted in Islam.Unnecessary invasion of the body is resisted,both because the body will still house the per-son in the grave and because God \"owns\" thebody. Disfiguring the dead is traditionally taboo,and seen to reflect a kind of madness on thepart of the perpetrator. However, a fatwa by Shaykh Ibnul-Muhammad al-'Attar medicalpurposes. 23Thus, both autopsy and postmortem are acceptable when, from a community per-spective, they are seen to \"command the good.\" Burial and mourning customs Islam does not accept cremation, since the bodycontains the person while in the grave. The deadare carried by relatives and friends to themosque for a final prayer, and are immediatelyburied. Many local traditions also continue: Pre-Islamic female wailing rites continue today inMuslim societies, even though the practice issaid to have been denounced by the Prophet.Recently, some Islamists have criticized theseactivities, fueling a current debate over\"Islamizing\" the burial process. Attending afuneral is considered meritorious even if onedoes not know the deceased. This view hasencouraged multiple services so that attendantscan participate in more than one celebration ofa pious believer. For example, on the third andfortieth days after death, services of remem-brance are held featuring Qur'anic recitationand gifts of food to attendees. Though frownedupon, gravesite visits are still a common ingredi-ent in remembrance. The particularly piousdeceased are sometimes petitioned to aid thedevotee in achieving some benefit, though thispractice is not validated in authoritative texts. Diet and drugs Muslim diet is governed by shari'ah , a dis- tinctive dietary ideology. Foods and drinks are categorized as pure or impure, lawful orunlawful. Eating pork is strictly unlawful; meatnot properly bled is impure. Dietary laws differbased on which Islamic group one belongs toand also which school one follows, but the rules are held to apply to all Muslims without regardto their social status. Drugs or medicines thatcontain alcohol are also subject to interdictionby some schools of law. During Ramadan, eatingrestrictions are observed, except by those whoare ill. Muslims consider participation in 17 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERSPECIAL CONCERNSTHEISLAMIC TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSRamadan a minimal standard of Islamic solidar- ity, and the sick will often try to meet therequirements on these grounds, despite prob-lematic results. Hospitals are normally not sub-ject to Ramadan restrictions. RREELLIIGGIIOOUUSSOOBBSSEERRVVAANNCCEESS Prayer Prayer is the fundamental religious expression of Muslims. It carries the same spiritual potency asChristian sacramentals. Today, Sunnis normallypray five times each day. In traditional Muslimsocieties, prayers punctuated daily events. Whilesuch regularity cannot be easily sustained incomplex urban environments, its authoritativestructure and religious cadence continues tocarry much weight. It is regarded as therapeuticby many Muslims today. Qur'an reading During Ramadan and at other auspiciousmoments during a Muslim's life, the Qur'an isread. Its power and beauty are not only aestheti-cally pleasing; its words are regarded as havingimplicit power. Recitation is an extremely meri-torious act that has spawned a whole dimensionof piety and therapy in Muslim popular religion.Reciting the Qur'an for the extremely ill can bea calming and uplifting gift. Prophetic medicineeven details how believers can write the verses,dissolve the ink in water and then ingest thesolution as a means to appropriate their benefit.Some of these acts are closer to folk medicinethan others, but they demonstrate the elevatedposition of the Qur'an's words in everyday piety. Ramadan Participating in Ramadan is held to have its ownintrinsic merit. Fasting from daybreak to sunsetimposes a religious regime on everyday routine,and calls for disruption of normal eating andsleeping patterns. During the fast, many Muslimsobserve lailat al-Qudr , a special night commem- orating when the Qur'an is believed to havebeen sent down. Many ill people make every effort to observe the skies that night so that theywill be blessed with seeing the spiritual descentof the word of God. In classical Islamic times,seeing evidence of this descent was considered aportent of good luck and health. Islamic law, however, excuses the seriously ill from the dietary rules of Ramadan; indeed,Islam teaches that believers should regard theirillness as a benefit from God, in effect substitut-ing the spiritual benefits of illness for those ofRamadan. In addition to Ramadan, Muslims may make other fasts as part of their own spiritual develop-ment. These fasts have certain proscriptions andcertain spiritual outcomes, according to Muslimlaw, which are all directed to the individual'spiety. This pilgrimage is required of every believer at some time during their lifetime. It is a strenu-ous undertaking, requiring a sound mind andbody. Because of its demands, it can have adecided impact on health, especially for thosewith coronary weaknesses. Despite this, makingthe hajj at the end of life is a dream manyMuslims hold dear, and it plays a role in thegeneral sense of spiritual well-being to whichMuslims aspire. Many elderly believers hope todie in or near Mecca, and this wish is often animportant motivation for making the hajj whenone is old and feeble, or when one's lifeexpectancy is seriously reduced through illness. Muharram rites Devotees of the Shiite tradition carry out rites,ceremonies, and performances every year on theanniversary of the death of Husain, the son of'Ali and grandson of the Prophet. These aredeeply felt community rites in which believersrecall the injustice done to a man, Husain, whothe Shiite believe should have led the wholeMuslim ummah. Instead, Husain was martyredat a desert spot near Karbala, Iraq, in 680 A.D.His death unleashed a powerful religious reac-tion that was eventually ritualized in acts ofpenance and sorrow. The death also confirmed 18the independent of the Shiite vision of Islamic order. The ceremonies involve a ritual lacerationin memory of this betrayal. Shiites see the slay-ing as a metaphor of the truth's continual battlewith evil in the world and as a symbol of com-mitment in the face of terrible odds. Believers sometimes participate in these rites in the hopeof solving a problem or healing a loved one. Like all religious traditions, Islam is chal-lenged by technological advances. This overview indicates that many intellectual andspiritual resources are available to grapple withthese changes and that Muslims have developeda system to cope with modern issues of healthcare, even as they acknowledge the problems entailed. Since Islam is a living tradition, manyof the issues here may be defined differently astechnology evolves. Debates about Islam andhealthcare decisions will likely occupy the com-munity for the foreseeable future. 19 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERCONCLUSIONTHEISLAMIC TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONS1.

Increasingly,health care workers face the challenge of provid-ing appropriate care and services to people of dif-ferent religious backgrounds. Unfortunately,many healthcare workers are unfamiliar with thereligious beliefs and moral positions of traditionsother than their own. This booklet is one of aseries that aims to provide accessible and practi-cal information about the values and beliefs ofdifferent religious traditions. It should assistnurses, physicians, chaplains, social workers, andadministrators in their decision making and caregiving. It can also serve as a reference for believ-ers who desire to learn more about their own tra-ditions. Each booklet gives an introduction to the his- tory of the tradition, including its perspectives onhealth and illness. Each also covers the tradi-tion's positions on a variety of clinical issues,with attention to the points at which moraldilemmas often arise in the clinical setting. Final-ly, each booklet offers information on specialconcerns relevant to the particular tradition. The editors have tried to be succinct, objec- tive, and informative. Wherever possible, we haveincluded the tradition's positions as reflected inofficial statements by a governing or other formalbody, or by reference to positions formulated byauthorities within the tradition. Bear in mindthat within any religious tradition, there may bemore than one denomination or sect that holdsviews in opposition to mainstream positions, orgroups that maintain different emphases. The editors also recognize that the beliefs and values of individuals within a tradition may varyfrom the so-called official positions of their tradi-tion. In fact, some traditions leave moral deci-sions about clinical issues to individualconscience. We would therefore caution the read-er against generalizing too readily. The guidelines in these booklets should notsubstitute for discussion of patients' own reli- gious views on clinical issues. Rather, theyshould be used to supplement information com-ing directly from patients and families, and usedas a primary source only when such firsthandinformation is not available. We hope that these booklets will help practi- tioners see that religious backgrounds and beliefsplay a part in the way patients deal with pain, ill-ness, and the decisions that arise in the course oftreatment. Greater understanding of religious tra-ditions on the part of care providers, we believe,will increase the quality of care received by thepatient.
