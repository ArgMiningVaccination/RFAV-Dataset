Where the mind tries to defend, the body always tells the truth, and it's the truth that will set you free. Through this process, you can reveal and let go of the unconscious physical and emotional patterns that keep you locked in cycles of pain. A few sessions with me can be more powerful than years in talk therapy. If you're in the Los Angeles area and ready to make a breakthrough in your mind-body health, contact me to find out if Orgone Energy Healing Therapy is right for you. I look forward to helping you feel the joy and vitality that's your true nature. \u2014 Freyda Campbell I've had the opportunity to share Freyda with some of my psychotherapy clients over the years. Her work is a synergy of her years practicing as an RN, her depth and knowledge of the human body and how emotions get stored in our bodies, and her passion and commitment to helping people get unstuck and work through pain and trauma to create healthier and wiser ways of being in the world. She is hands-on, heart in, with her feet firmly rooted in the ground. I am honored to know Freyda, and I refer to her with confidence. \u2014 Orly, Psychotherapist in Santa Monica "}
