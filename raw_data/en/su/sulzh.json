The key challenge is the safe and efficient delivery of pharmaceutically well-defined antigens in a noninflammatory context. Here, we show that systemic delivery of nanoparticle-formulated 1 methylpseudouridine-modified messenger RNA (m1Y mRNA) coding for disease-related autoantigens results in antigen presentation on splenic CD11c+antigen- presenting cells in the absence of costimulatory signals. In several mouse models of multiple sclerosis,the disease is suppressed by treatment with such m1 YmRNA. The treatment effect is associated with a reduction of effector T cells and the development of regulatory T cell (T regcell) populations. Notably, these T regcells execute strong bystander immunosuppression and thus improve disease induced by cognate and noncognate autoantigens. Antigen-specific tolerization for the treat- ment of autoimmune diseases may se- lectively blunt autoimmunity without compromising normal immune function. In the past decades, various approaches have been studied, including delivery of auto- immune antigens using DNA, synthetic peptides, recombinant proteins, coated nanoparticles, or immunomodulatory cellular therapies [reviewed in (1)]. However, clinical translation remained elusive, with largely negative or inconclusiveoutcomes in human studies, and only a few approaches are in early clinical testing. One impediment is the polyclonal complexity of autoimmune diseases driven by distinctive, diverse autoreactive immune cell repertoires of patients. The interindividual variability re- quires either personalized treatment tailored for the autoantigenic immune profiles of the patients or therapies that mediate bystander tolerance to suppress both cognate and non- cognate autoimmune lymphocytes without broad immune suppression ( 2).The physiological induction and maintenance of peripheral tolerance is based on the pre- sentation of self-antigens by lymphoid antigen- presenting cells (APCs) with low-level surface expression of costimulatory molecules, such asCD86. We sought to develop a therapeutic ap- proach that would emulate natural mechanisms of immune tolerance. We recently introduced a liposomal formulation for systemic delivery of strong type 1T helper (T H1) cell responses driven by high levels of interferon- a(IFN- a), released from APCs upon Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling (3). Replacement of uridine (U) by incorpo- ration of 1-methylpseudouridine (m1 Y)d u r i n g in vitro transcription and subsequent removal of double-stranded mRNA contaminants is known to abrogate TLR7-triggering activity and to reduce inflammatory properties of single- stranded mRNA (4 -6). We hypothesized that the use of such nucleosi de-modified, purified mRNA (m1 YmRNA) for in vivo delivery of autoimmune disease tar get antigens into CD11c+ APCs in a noninflammatory context would en- able systemic tolerogenic antigen presentation in lymphoid tissues. Noninflammatory delivery of antigen-encoding m1YmRNA into the spleen expands antigen-specific CD4+regulatory T cells To test this hypothesis, we engineered nanoparticle-formulated mRNA-LPX (herein referred to as mRNA) consisting of nonim- munogenic (m1 Y)o ri m m u n o g e n i c( U )m R N A complexed with liposomes that lack inherentadjuvant activity. In a first experiment, mRNAcoding for the reporter gene firefly luciferase(LUC) or saline as control was administeredintravenously into albino C57BL/6 mice, and the translation and expression of the LUC protein was assessed. In line with previous reports, administra- tion of U mRNA led to strong activation of CD11c +APCs and lymphocytes, and secretion of high levels of IFN- a(Fig. 1, A to C, and fig. S1, A and B). By contrast, we did not observe secretion of IFN- aor other inflammatory APCs, CD8+and CD4+T cells, or natural killer (NK) and B cells in m1 YmRNA -treated mice (Fig. 1, A to C, and fig. S1, A and B). Notably,translation of LUC was profoundly higher and prolonged in m1 YmRNA -treated animals (Fig. 1, D and E). These findings suggest thatm1Y mRNA is suitable for noninflammatory delivery of proteins into splenic CD11c +APCs. To study the effects of m1 YmRNA in an autoimmune disease, we chose experimentalautoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a clin- ically relevant mouse model of multiple sclero- sis (MS), in which we previously demonstrated tolerance induction by selectively expressing MOG 35-55, the assessed the effect of antigen-encoding m1YmRNA treatment on T cell expansion. Na\u00efve Thy1.2+C 5 7 B L / 6m i c ew e r ei m m u n i z e d with MOG 35-55m1Yor U mRNA, and the ex- pansion of both endogenous T cells and adop-tively transferred MOG 35-55-T cell receptor transgenic Thy1.1+CD4+T cells from 2D2 mice (8) was assessed. Both MOG 35-55-encoding mRNAs induced proliferation of adoptivelytransferred CD4 +2D2 T cell, MOG 35-55 1F). Similarly, endogenous MOG 35-55-specific CD4+T cells in na\u00efve mice were expanded by both MOG 35-55- encoding mRNAs (Fig. 1G). However, the func- tional properties of the T cells induced with either of these mRNAs differed profoundly. MOG 35-55m1YmRNA treatment was capable of expanding or inducing de novo Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (T regcells) in both wild-type C57BL/6 and 2D2-Foxp 3-eGFP transgenic m i c e( F i g .1 Ha n df i g .S 2 A ) ,w h e r e a so v e r a l lfrequencies of CD4 +Foxp3+T cells did not c h a n g e( F i g .1 H ) .C D 4+T cells from vaccinated 2D2 animals inhibited the in vitro proliferation of antigen-specific na\u00efve CD4 T cells in a dose- dependent manner. By contrast, CD4+Tc e l l so f MOG 35-55U mRNA or control-treated mice showed little to no suppressive activity (fig. S2B). We studied the cytokine response profiles upon in vitro antigen restimulation and the phenotypes of expanded T cells in repetitive- ly vaccinated C57BL/6 mice in more detail.

Exposure to m1Y mRNA does not impair the capability to mount immune responses CD11c+APCs of mice first exposed to m1Y mRNA and thereafter injected with U mRNAdid not show any impairment in their ability to respond to this TLR-agonistic stimulus with up-regulation of costi mulatory molecules and IFN-asecretion (Fig. 2, A and B). To inves- tigate whether the induction and expansion of MOG 35-55-specific CD4+Tregcells affects de novo priming of antigen-specific immuneresponses, we exploited two broadly used model systems. First, C57BL/6 mice underwent prime-boost (days 6 and 13) vaccination with U mRNA encoding the ovalbumin (OVA) epitope SIINFEKL and were concurrently exposed to MOG 35-55-encoding m1Y mRNA (days 0, 3, 7, and 10). SIINFEKL-specific CD8+T cells were expanded above 40% of total blood CD8+ T cells (Fig. 2C) and displayed properties ofeffector T (T eff)c e l l ss u c ha sc o g n a t eI F N - gse- cretion and highly potent and antigen-specific killing (Fig. 2, D and E), which suggested un- compromised T cell priming and expansion. In a second experiment, mice were immunized intramuscularly with a self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) vaccine encoding influenza hemag- glutinin (HA) (day 6) concurrent to repeated treatment with MOG 35-55m1YmRNA or con- trols. Again, the capability of mice to mount aprotective immune response and develop neu- tralizing antibodies was unimpaired (Fig. 2, F and G). Overall, both studies demonstrate that MOG 35-55m1YmRNA -induced antigen- specific CD4+Tregcells do not suppress nonmyelinantigens. Treatment with antigen-encoding m1Y mRNA ameliorates EAE in mice Next, we studied the tolerogenic potential of MOG 35-55 m1YmRNA in C57BL/6 mice with MOG 35-55-induced EAE. Treatment with MOG 35-55 m1Y mRNA was capable of block- ing all clinical signs of EAE in mice (Fig. 3A),whereas control animals showed the typical course of the disease with rapid monophasic progression. In mice started on MOG 35-55m1Y mRNA treatment when a paralysis of the tailor beginning of the hin dlimbs were noted (disease score of 1 to 2 of EAE), further diseaseprogression could be prevented, and motorfunctions were restored (Fig. 3B and fig. S4A).This included occasional cases of reversion of paralysis, which was most likely attributable to an anti-inflammatory effect rather than tis- sue repair. Various effects were observed in mice treated with antigen-encoding m1 YmRNA compared with control animals. In the brain and spinalcord, the total amount of infiltrating CD4 + T cells, MOG 35-55-specific CD4+T CD4+T cells secreting IL-17A were considerably lower (Fig. C, D,and F, and figs. S4B and S5). Demyelination of the spinal cord was also considerably re-duced (Fig. 3E). In the spleen of MOG 35-55m1Y mRNA- treated animals, we observed an in- crease of lymphocytes (fig. S5), including MOG 35-55-specific CD4+Tc e l l sw i t hl o wC D 6 2 L , CCR7, and CD62L are critical for access of T cells to the central ner- vous system (CNS) ( 9-12), and the transmem- b r a n eC - t y p el e c t i nC D 6 9i sk n o w nt op r o m o t el y m p h o c y t er e t e n t i o ni nt h es p l e e n( 13). Next, we analyzed the autoantigen-specific CD4 +T cells in those mice in which the man- ifestation of EAE was prevented by treatmentwith MOG 35-55m1YmRNA on days 7 and 10. MOG 35-55-specific splenic CD4+T cells from treated animals showed down-regulation of the activation marker CD44 and strong ex- pression of coinhibitory molecules (Fig. 3G). At the peak of disease (day 16 after disease cells. Furthermore, we detected a highly activated T regcell population (Fig. 3, H and I) and lower numbers of T H1a n dT H17 MOG 35-55-specific CD4+T cells (Fig. 3H). Similar findings in mice with symptomatic EAE (diseasescore of 1 to 2 at start of treatment) further confirmed the potent disease-suppressive activ- ity of antigen-encoding m1 YmRNA (fig. S4). We extended our study of the preventive and therapeutic effect of m1 YmRNA to other EAE mouse models. The SJL model is based onautoreactivity against the PLP 139-151 epitope and is characterized by recurring EAE symptoms resulting in a relapsing-remitting disease, sim- ilar to the clinical presentation of MS in pa- tients. Treatment of SJL mice with PLP 139-151 m1YmRNA twice a week starting from day 7 after EAE induction resulted in almost full disease control (fig. S7A). Even when the mice were treated after the first disease peak (start- ing on day 14 after disease induction), progres- sion of the disease was halted (fig. S7B). Treatment with m1Y mRNA leads to therapeutically effective bystander tolerance In another experimental setup, we addressed a k e yc h a l l e n g ei nh u m a nM S ,n a m e l yt h a t antigen spread leads to a complex antimyelin autoreactivity pattern and the specificity ofautoreactive T cell clones in individual pa-tients, and thus, the potential targets for di- rect antigen-specific tolerization is unknown. A clinically viable approach would be to use bystander tolerance by inducing T regcells, which, once activated by their cognate antigen,would suppress T cells against other antigens in the inflamed tissue. We evaluated bystander activity in two ex- perimental settings. F1 C57BL/6 x SJL mice with is capable of inducing potent effector T regcells), or irrelevant m1 YmRNA (Fig. 4A and 35-55 m1YmRNA treatment showed a dose-dependent thera- peutic effect on EAE, similar to the curative effect mediated by va ccination with PLP 139-151 m1YmRNA, indicating a strong T regcell- mediated bystander suppression, also given the fact that antigen spread has been described for this particular EAE model (14 ). Antigen- specific T regcells were notably expanded and highly activated, constituting >80% of de novo expanded MOG 35-55 -specific CD4+splenic T cells (Fig. 4, B and C). T effcell infiltration into the brain and spinal cord in m1 YmRNA - treated mice was reduced (Fig. 4, D to F), andno signs of demyelination in the spinal cord were detected (Fig. 4G). We also investigated a complex EAE model driven by multiple pathogenic autoreactive Tc e l lc l o n e sa g a i n s tM O G 35-55,P be successfully treated with the mixture of m1 YmRNAs coding for the corresponding four disease-inducing aut mRNA encoding MOG peutically almost as effective as those encod-ing the cocktail of all four disease targets. This suggests that even polyclonal autoimmune disease driven by a broad autoreactive T cell repertoire can be sufficiently controlled by m1YmRNA targeting a strong bystander tolerance -mediating T cell epitope (fig. S7D). One potential risk associated with antigen- specific tolerization is the induction of auto- antibodies against respective targets, which can exacerbate disease ( 15). Moreover, nucleoside- modified mRNA is known to be highly im-munogenic and to induce h igh antibody titers when formulated with immune stimulatorylipid nanoparticles (16 ana- lyzed G (IgG) antibody responses in the sera of EAE mice upon m1 YmRNA vaccination.

Downloaded from https://www.science.org at Stanford University on January 27, 2022 with irrelevant m1 YmRNA or saline (fig. S8A). This suggests that m1 YmRNA application does not exacerbate preformed autoantibody re- sponses. Even after repetitive MOG 35-55m1Y mRNA challenge (twice per week, 12 timesin total) of F1 C57BL/6 x SJL mice, no anti - MOG 35-55 IgG antibodies were detected in those where EAE was induced with PLP 139-151 - peptide immunization (fig. S8B). Distinct antigen-specific CD4+T cell subsets are expanded in EAE mice treated with antigen-encoding m1Y mRNA Next, we characterized the tolerized T cells by subjecting splenic tetramer+CD4+T cells from animals treated with MOG 35-55 m1Y mRNA or irrelevant antigen-specific CD4 + T cell subsets in EAE mice (Fig. 5, A and B, andfig. S9). The CD4 +Tc e l li d e n t i t yo fa l ls u b s e t s was confirmed with canonical T cell markers(fig. S10). We used sets of genes characterizing different functional T cell subphenotypes for further analysis (figs. S11 and S12). We iden- tified two distinct populations sharing com- mon T regcell markers ( Foxp3 ,Ikzf2 ,a n dCtla4). ,Il10,Gzmb n Icos), whereas the other subset were central T regcells as defined by markers Sell andBcl2 and low expression of the common effector-associated molecules ( 17,18) (figs. S11, A and B, T (IfngandTbx21 ), TH17 Ifng,a n cells ( Lag3 and Cd160 ), T (Il4 ,Il21,a n d Cxcr5 ), and a T cell cluster with a memory phenotype (Ccr7highandTcf7high)( f i g s .S 1 1 ,Ct oH ,a n d S13, B and C). The relative frequencies of these antigen- specific CD4+T cell subpopulations changed in EAE mice treated with antigen-encoding m1YmRNA. Most notably, in animals treated with MOG 35-55 m1YmRNA, the effector T reg cells constituted the largest cluster by fre-quency and cell count (Fig. 5C). The T H1, TH17, and T H1/T H17 T effcell subpopulations were strongly reduced in comparison with those of control animals treated with irrelevant m1Y mRNA, whereas exhausted T cell and central Tregcell subpopulations were of similar size in both groups (Fig. 5C). We also found sub-stantial differences in the expression levels of functionally relevant genes and activation markers. Common T regcell markers such as Foxp3 ,Ikzf2 , and Ctla4 were present in T reg cell subpopulations of both treatment groups (Fig. 5D), whereas transcripts characteristic for effector T regcells and associated with T reg cell suppressive function, such as Klrg1 ,Il10,Gzmb ,Lag3,a n dIcos ,w e r ee n r i c h e di nM O G 35-55 m1YmRNA -treated EAE mice and almost com- pletely absent in those treated with irrelevant m1Y mRNA (Fig. 5, E and F). Likewise, the transcript profiles of the T H1, T H17, and T H1/ TH17 T effcell clusters differed considerably be- tween the two treatment groups (Fig. 5G andfig. S14A). The most prominent examples of differentially regulated genes were those in- volved in Bhlhe40 )(27). In accordance with a previous study ( 28), we detected mainly down- regulation of genes associated with cell cycle and cell division in the mice treated with MOG 35-55m1YmRNA (fig. S14B). The number of genes up-regulated in m1YmRNA -treated mice was small (fig. S14A). To visualize the relationships between the identified major cell populations, we performedsingle-cell trajectory analysis (fig. S15). Each state represents subpopulation structures of closely related transitory cellular states. T cells from mice treated with irrelevant m1 YmRNA appeared mainly as fully differentiated cells instate 5, representing T H1, T H17, and T H1/TH17 Teffc e l l s( f i g .S 1 5 ,B ,D ,a n dF ) .B yc o n t r a s t , T cells from the MOG 35-55m1YmRNA -treated group were in state 1 (memory) or mainlydifferentiated in state 2, representing effector T regcells and T FHcells (fig. S15, B, C, and F). In sum, these findings indicate that m1 YmRNA treatment rather than deleting autoreactive T cells tips the immunol ogical balance in favor of suppression of disease promoting MOG 35-55- specific T H1, T H17, and T H1/TH17 by expanding effector T regcells. PD-1 and CTLA-4 signaling contribute to the induction and maintenance of antigen-specific tolerance Expression of coinhibitory receptors such as CTLA-4 and PD-1 on effector and T regcells is a key mechanism of immune homeostasis. Wetherefore assessed the mechanistic contribu-tion of these pathways to antigen-specific tol- erance mediated by m1 YmRNA. Treatment of EAE with MOG 35-55 m1YmRNA com- bined with anti- PD-1 or anti -CTLA-4 anti- body on days 7 and 10 after EAE inductionaggravated the disease in control groups in accordance with the known unleashing effectof checkpoint blockade on autoreactive T cells (29). Both CTLA-4 and PD-1 blockade almost completely abolished the EAE-protective effectof MOG 35-55m1Ym R N A( F i g .5 ,Ha n dI ) .F l o w cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing re-vealed almost exclusive and high expression of Ctla4 by MOG 35-55-specific CD4+Tregcells (fig. S16, A and B), which supports a role of thispopulation for mediating tolerance. The effect of PD-1 blockade may be driven by two inde-pendent mechanisms, one being invigorationof preexistent T effcells and the other being the inhibition of the de novo induction of antigen-specific T regcells, which also depends crucially on PD-1 signaling ( 30). These findings suggest that disease-mediating T cells are suppressed but not deleted in mice treated with antigen- encoding m1 YmRNA and that both PD-1 and CTLA-4 signaling critically contribute to theinduction and maintenance of antigen-specific tolerance. Discussion Our study describes nanoparticulate delivery of mRNA antigen-specific toler-ization. We show, at single-cell resolution, the generation of different antigen-specific CD4 + T cell subpopulations with distinct functionalstates. Selective delivery of autoantigens into CD11c + APCs resident in lymphoid tissues exploits a highly effective natural mechanism for induc- tion and maintenance of peripheral tolerance. The presentation of autoantigens in a nonin- flammatory context leads to and Foxp3+effector only suppress antigen-specific autoreactive T effcells but also exert bystander immunosuppression,thereby enabling disease control even in a complex, polyclonal model of autoimmunity. Bystander activity of T regcells has been as- sociated with noncogna te mechanisms depend- ing on cell-cell interact ion, such as secretion of suppressive factors, e.g., IL-10 and transforming growth factor- b(TGF-b )(32). Thus, one would expect that MOG-specific T regcells activated upon reexposure to their cognate antigen in the CNS would suppress immune responses that occur at that very location for a defined period of time. Because of its temporo-spatial nature, Tregcell activity exerts tissue-specific immune regulation rather than pan-immune suppres-sion ( 33). This is in line with prior studies in- dicating that T cell tolerance to tissue-restricted self-antigens is actively mediated by antigen- specific T regcells rather than deletion ( 34). With the presented approach, key challenges for clinical translation of antigen-based treat- ment of autoimmune diseases can be addressed. Both the nucleoside-modified, purified mRNA and the liposomal nanoparticle formulation are pharmaceutically well-defined clinical-stage compounds and are currently being explored in human trials for various disease indications (35). The repetitive administration of m1Y mRNA is not compromised by induction ofautoantigen-specific antibody responses, which usually causes safety-limiting constraints for other applications.

Thus, tailoring the treatment for the disease-causing antigens of individual patients is conceivable, similar to that which has been successfully executed in the setting of person- alized cancer vaccines ( 36,37). Combination multiple person- alized autoantigens or autoantigens that con- fer bystander tolerance may enable control of even complex autoimmune diseases. REFERENCES AND NOTES 1. P. Serra, P.

Copyright \u00a9 2021, American Association for the Advancement of ScienceA noninflammatory mRNA vaccine for treatment therapy for immune tolerance Autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), result from a breach of immunological self-tolerance and tissue damage by autoreactive T lymphocytes. Current treatments can cause systemic immune suppression and side effects such as increased risk of infections. Krienke et al. designed a messenger RNA vaccine strategy that lacks adjuvant activity and delivers MS autoantigens into lymphoid dendritic cells. This approach expands a distinct type of antigen- specific effector regulatory T cell that suppresses autoreactivity against targeted autoantigens and promotes bystander suppression of autoreactive T cells against other myelin-specific autoantigens. In mouse models of MS, the vaccine delayed the onset and reduced the severity of established disease without showing overt symptoms of general immune suppression.
