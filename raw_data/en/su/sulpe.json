The immunostimulatory effects of ginseng berry polysaccharides, however, remain unclear. Effects of polysaccharides from ginseng berry on the activation of natural killer (NK) cells and inhibition of tumors are reported. A crude polysaccharide was isolated from ginseng berry as a ginseng berry polysaccharide portion (GBPP) and was further fractionated using gel filtration chromatography to obtain the three polysaccharide fractions GBPP-I, -II Stimulation of murine peritoneal macrophages by GBPP-I showed the greatest enhancement of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-12 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- production. In addition, an ex vivo assay of natural killer (NK) cell activity showed that oral (p.o.) administration of GBPP-I significantly increased NK cell cytotoxicity in YAC-1 tumor cells production of B. Prophylactic intravenous (i.v.) and p.o. administration of inhibited lung metastatic activity in B16BL6 melanoma cells. Depletion of NK cells after injection of rabbit anti-asialo GM1 partially abolished the inhibitory effect of GBPP-I on lung metastasis, indicating that NK cells play an important role in anticancer effects. GBPP-I exerts a strong immune-enhancing activity and can prevent cancer metastasis through activation of NK cells and Scientific Publishing Company.
