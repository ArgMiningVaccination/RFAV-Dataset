Kasar Devi is endowed with an enormous geomagnetic field and cosmic energy similar to that of the UK's Stonehenge and Peru's Machu Pichu where high positive radiations can be felt hence, it is believed to be a perfect place for meditation and inner healing. The beautiful and famous Kasar Devi temple where Swami Vivekananda meditated and Bob Dylan, and George Harrison have spent time is just a km away from our stay. [Life In Samatva](/center/life-in-samatva) Life in Samatva believes in curating retreats that are wholesome, transformational, fun, and an experience to learn, relax and heal. Yoga isn't just about being able to do handstands or headstands as it is understood to be today. That is just a minuscule part of what yoga truly is. Yoga is the union of the mind with the divine intelligence of the universe. It is our true way of being. It is the experience of the world within and around us. We believe discomforts and challenges can always be channeled correctly for our inner growth and development.
