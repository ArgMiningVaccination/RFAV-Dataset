Helping individuals and families recover from alcoholism and substance use disorder through detoxification, residential, and outpatient services. Discovery Institute, formerly known as Discovery House, was operated under the auspices of the New Jersey State Department of Health until 1984 when approval was granted by the state enabling us to convert to a private, nonprofit corporation, which we continue to maintain today. Discovery Institute rehab facilities in NJ use state, federal, county, and private funding sources, as well as private insurance and self-paying clients to provide treatment to people of all walks of life statewide and from the tri-state area. Discovery has developed its identity as a private, nonprofit corporation. Several enhancements and renovations were made to the facilities and existing programs. These changes included adding a [short-term residential program](https://www.discoverynj.org/short-term-residential-program/), providing family education and therapy, installing a state of the art fitness center, as well as obtaining additional professional staff to suit the needs of our growing population. Today, Discovery Institute is an established and trusted facility that caters to the tri-state area, with representatives in Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York.
