Many essential oils are toxic in large doses. - Know which oils may cause burns if applied to skin that is exposed to the sun. - Use extra caution with children, the elderly or those with compromised immune systems. For thousands of years, herbs and other plants have been used to treat a variety of illnesses and ailments. Today, aromatherapists, alternative medicine advocates and even some mainstream medical professionals are recommending essential oils, obtained from and containing the essence of plants and similar sources, as an even more powerful solution. Did You Know? One drop of peppermint essential oil is equivalent to 25 cups of peppermint tea. There are comparatively few scientific studies regarding the effectiveness of essential oils, and proven effectiveness varies by oil. Nevertheless, many essential oils users say they have experienced positive changes in mood and alleviated physical symptoms by applying oils to the skin, inhaling them or diffusing them in the air. \"(Essential oils) have been used for thousands of years,\" says Deborah Zerkle, a certified aromatherapist, licensed massage therapist and owner of Homestead Aromatics. \"The distillation process is very old.\" \"A lot of plant material is steamed and distilled down in order to get that little bottle,\" says Brooke Sackenheim, managing recreation coordinator for the Ohio Herb Education Center in Gahanna and a longtime student and teacher of herbal medicine and aromatherapy. Distillation leads to a highly concentrated product, so essential oil users may feel the effects more quickly than those who seek out less concentrated formats such as herbal teas or baths. \"I think that's why people are drawn to them,\" says Sackenheim. \"They instantly feel better.\" Did You Know? Essential oils work by entering the bloodstream (if applied topically) or traveling to the brain via the olfactory nerve and triggering the brain's limbic system (if inhaled). Multiple studies have found that lavender can help improve sleep quality and have a calming and uplifting effect, making it a popular choice for those with anxiety or depression. It has also been used to treat mild burns and headaches. Sackenheim says lavender isn't the only oil that can have a positive effect on mood. In addition to soothing an upset stomach, peppermint oil or even a cup of peppermint tea is great for a morning energy boost. She also recommends trying florals such as jasmine and geraniums to ground the emotions and stay focused. While essential oils can be effective, it's important to understand they aren't a miracle cure. \"If any (essential oil) claims to cure something, that should be a red flag,\" says Sackenheim. Did You Know? According to Handbook of Essential Oils: Science, Technology, and Applications, the term \"essential oils\" comes from Aristotle's idea that matter is composed of the four elements and a fifth element - the quintessence - is the spirit or life force of an object. Essential oils are derived by steaming and distilling plants, a process that was once thought to remove the spirit from the plant. Therefore, these oils were thought to be the quintessence of the plant, and the term \"quintessential oils\" was eventually shortened to \"essential oils.\" Essential oils aren't approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat any condition or cure any disease. Because research is limited and results vary, it's important for users to try different oils out and find what works for them. Both Sackenheim and Zerkle stress that just because a product is natural doesn't mean it is safe. Many essential oils can be toxic in large doses, so knowing how to properly use different oils is key. While some oils are safe to apply \"neat\" - directly to the skin - others can cause irritation if used this way. Using a carrier oil can help dilute the oils and spread them over a larger area of skin. The Ohio Herb Education Center in Gahanna \"I tell people that the best thing people can do is educate themselves,\" says Sackenheim. \"Read books, find certified aromatherapists and take classes.\" And while essential oils can be helpful, they can't replace fundamental health needs such as adequate sleep and regular exercise, she says. \"When it comes to alternative medicine, there is not one natural cure-all,\" says Sackenheim. \"It's best to use a multi-pronged approach to health, addressing the factors of diet, exercise and lifestyle stressors. You need to nourish the body, the mind and the soul.\" Katie Ellington is a contributing writer. Feedback welcome at gbishop@cityscenemediagroup.com. RELATED READS [A guide "}
