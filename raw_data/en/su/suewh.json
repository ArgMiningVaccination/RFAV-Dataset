INTRODUCTION This discussion is presented from the perspective o f a Pennsylvania employer human resource manager. The job of human resource manager is a challenging one that requires a wide range of skill sets. It insists that at any given moment, the individual assume the role of benefits coordinator, physician, accountant, psycho logist and attorney. 1 Robert J.

The primary goal of this discussion is to facilitat e the efficient and effective administration of claims made under the Pennsylvani a Workers' Compensation Act. In order to achieve that goal, the discussion will review the interplay between six statutory provisions and the administration of Penn sylvania workers' compensation claims - the Pennsylvania Unemployment Compensation Law, the Americans with Disability Act, the Family Medical Leave Act, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, COBRA and the Affordable Care Act. II. RELEVANT POLICY CONSIDERATIONS The basic policy considerations underlying the stat utory regimes that our discussion will address can be summarized as follow s: (a) The Pennsylvania Workers' Compensation Act - The es sential purpose of the Workers' Compensation Act is to prov ide the employee with wage loss replacement benefits and me dical coverage resulting from a work-related injury. (b) The Pennsylvania Unemployment Compensation Law - Th e essential purpose of the Unemployment Compensation Law is to provide wage loss replacement benefits to the employee who is ca pable of working, but who has experienced wage loss as a result of an involuntary termination of employment in the absence of willful misconduct. (c) The Family Medical Leave Act - The essential purpos e of the Family Medical Leave Act is to prevent the employee from h aving to choose between his or her job and his or her health needs or the health/child needs of his or her family. (d) The Americans with Disabilities Act - The essential purpose of ADA is to prevent discrimination against the employee w ho suffers from a physical or mental disability, but who is otherwise qualified to perform the essential functions of his or her job. (e) Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 - The ess ential purpose of Title VII is to prohibit discrimination by covered employ ers on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, pregna ncy, age and disability. 5 5 Title VII has been supplemented by the Pregnancy D iscrimination Act of 1978, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. In addition, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has declared that employment - 3 - (f) The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 6 - The essential purpose of COBRA is to provide a health i nsurance safety net to covered employees and family members, at the employee's expense, when group coverage would otherwise be los t due to certain employment separation events. (g) The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act - Th e essential purpose of the Affordable Care Act, or \"Obama Care, \" is to expand health insurance coverage for previously uninsured Americans while reducing the cost of health care. III. STATUTORY ELEMENTS A. THE PENNSYLVANIA WORKERS' COMPENSATION ACT, 77 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1 ET. SEQ. General Rule - A claim for benefits will be awarded under the Workers' Compensation Act where: (a) an employee; (b) suffe rs a physical or emotional injury; (c) arising in the course of employment and (d) related to employment 7. B. THE UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION LAW, 43 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 751-9 14 General Rule - A claim for benefits under the Unemp loyment Compensation Law will be granted where (1) an employee; (2) who is capable of continuing to perform work; (3) experiences an involuntary discharge; and (4) has not engaged in willful misconduct. Charles v. Unemployment Compensation Bo ard of Review, 122 Pa. Cmwlth. 439, 552 A.2d 727 (1989). C. THE FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE ACT 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 6381-638 7 General Rule - For private employers who employ fifty or more employees for twenty or more calendar work weeks in the current o r preceding calendar year; and state and local government employers, regardless of the number of employees, a qualified individual employee must be afforded twelve weeks of unpaid leave during a twelve month perio d in order to allow him or her attend to his own \"s erious health discrimination on the basis of gender identity or t ransgender status is prohibited under Title VII. In addressing the role of the EEOC, the U.S. Depart ment of Labor has explained that \"[f]or applicants to and employees of most private employe rs, state and local governments, educational institutions, employment agencies and labor organiz ations, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is an independent federal agency that pr omotes equal opportunity in employment through administrative and judicial enforcement of the federal civil rights laws and through education and technical assistance.\" 6 The provision is officially known as\" The Consolid ated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985.\" Since it was signed into law on April 7, 198 6 the title of the statute often references the 1986 date. 7 The Act will be liberally construed in order to ef fectuate its humanitarian purpose. See Lehigh County v. Workmen's Compensation Appeal Board (Wolf e), 539 Pa. 322, 652 A.2d 797 (1995). - 4 -condition\" or the serious health condition of a spo use 8, child or parent, or the birth/adoption/placement of a child, with guarantee d continuation of group health benefits. 9 D. THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT 42 U.S.C.A.\u00a7\u00a7 1 2101- 22213 10 , General Rule - For private employers who employ fifteen or more employees , and for all state and local government employers, r egardless of the number of employees, the law prohibits discrimination against persons with \"disabilities,\" who are otherwise qualified to perform the essential functi ons of the job, with respect to all aspects of employment including application, hiring , wages, benefits, discipline, promotion, and work environment. 11 E. TITLE VII OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1964, 42 U.S.C \u00a72000 General Rule - The Civil Rights Act prohibits discr imination by covered employers on the basis of race, color, religion, se x, national origin, or association with another individual of a particular race, color, rel igion, sex or national origin, or on the basis of his or her interracial association with an other. The law has been supplemented by legislation that prohibits discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, age, disability, gender identity and transgender status. E. CONSOLIDATED OMNIBUS BUDGET RECONCILIATION ACT OF 1986 (COBRA), PUB. L. 99-272, 100 STAT. 82 General Rule - The law, commonly referred to as COB RA, requires that the employer afford continued access to group health care insurance to employees and 8 On February 25, 2015, the Department of Labor issu ed a Final Rule revising the regulatory definition of spouse under the FMLA to include \"sam e sex spouses,\" meaning that eligible employees in legal same-sex marriages will be able to take FMLA leave to care for their spouse or family member, regardless of where they live. The F inal Rule became effective March 27, 2015. 9 As discussed below, in order to qualify for FMLA p rotection, the employee must have worked for the employer for a total of twelve months, thou gh not consecutively, and for at least 1,250 hours during the previous twelve-month period, at a location in the United States, or in any territory or possession of the United States, where at least fifty employees are employed by the employer within seventy-five miles. 10 The ADA has been described as \" the most expansive and significant civil rights leg islation enacted by Congress since the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \" See \"Taming of the Three-Headed Monster: Disabled Workers and the ADA, FMLA and Workers' Compensation\" Christopher E. Parker, Freeman, Mathis & Gary, LLP. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has primary authority for enforci ng the employment provisions of the ADA. 11 Title I of the ADA prohibits employers of fifteen or more workers, employment agencies, and labor organizations of fifteen or more workers from discriminating against qualified individuals with disabilities. Title II of the ADA prohibits st ate and local governments from discriminating against qualified individuals with disabilities in programs, activities, and services. - 5 -their covered family members, at the employee's expense , where the employee experiences a \"qualifying event\" that results in a loss of coverage such as a voluntarily resignation, an involuntary termination in the abse nce of \"gross misconduct,\" or a reduction in work hours. F. THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT General Rule - Signed into law by President Barack Obama on March 23, 2010 and declared constitutional by the United States Su preme Court on June 28, 2012, \"The Affordable Care Act\" or \"Obama Care\" has engendered substantial political rhetoric and maneuvering by the U.S. Congress, state legislature s, governors, lobbyists and political pundits. President Obama has described the Affordab le Care Act as \"the most important piece of social legislation since the Social Securi ty Act passed in the 1930's and the most important reform of our health care system since Me dicare passed in the 1960s.\" 12 The law creates a national framework for providing near universal health insurance coverage and outlines strategies to increase access to affordable, improved care while containing costs. The central provisions of the law - guaranteed affordable and accessible coverage - became effective January 1, 2 014 IV. HYPOTHETICAL The following hypothetical is based upon an actual employment scenario that ultimately resulted in workers' compensation litiga tion. The facts have been altered somewhat but the thrust of the story is based upon real events. The purpose of the hypothetical is to allow our dis cussion to apply the policies and statutory requirements of a series of employmen t law regimes while addressing a claim for benefits under the Act. Hopefully, the facts will spur a great deal of thou ght, and a great deal of discussion through which all of us will become bett er equipped to handle our own unique employment situations that arise in perhaps more conventional circumstances. The facts of our hypothetical are as follows : Steve Jackson is a sixty-year old, Caucasian male, who is a thirty-year veteran of the Boston Police Force, now retired. He stands ap proximately 6'2\" tall and approximately 250 lbs. 12 Part of this section is based upon \"The Affordable Care Act and Effects on the Workers' Compensation System: In General, Cost-Shifting, and the Implications of Employer-Sponsored Wellness Programs\" presented by Judge David B. Torr ey at the National Association of Workers' Compensation Judiciary, National Workers' Compensat ion Judicial College on August 20, 2013 in Orlando, Florida. The authors have also relied upon observations set forth in a paper presented by Dr. Dean Hashimoto during the same conference en titled \"The Affordable Care Act and Its Effects on Workers' Compensation.\" The authors wish to thank Judge Torrey and Dr. Hashimoto for allowing us to share their observations and rea soned conclusions. - 6 -Mr. Jackson has a high school education. He also ha s significant training in law enforcement, which includes restraining individuals , dealing with potentially violent confrontations, as well as identifying and addressi ng potential terroristic threats. After moving to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Mr. Jacks on took a job as a full-time security officer at a local mall. He received minim al on the job training upon starting his position. His new supervisor deferred to his knowle dge and training as a former police officer. In general terms, the security officers we re instructed to provide for the safety of the patrons at the mall, and when necessary, to cal l in local law enforcement to deal with individuals they thought were dangerously violent. One afternoon, in the performance of his duties, Mr . Jackson came across a vehicle that was illegally parked. Consistent with his job duties, he placed a standardized form on the window indicating that the person had illegally parked and was subject to being towed. After several minutes, Mr. Jackson observed the owner of the vehicle come out and remove the notice from the vehicle, crumble it up and throw it on the ground. The individual then retrieved someth ing from his vehicle and began to proceed back towards the mall. Mr. Jackson confront ed the individual and informed him that he needed to immediately move his vehicle or b e towed. The individual, using a number of expletives, told Mr. Jackson that he spen t enough money in the mall and that he was not worried. Again, consistent with his understanding of his job duties and the policies of the mall, Mr. Jackson called a local tow company and ha d the vehicle towed. When the owner of the vehicle returned to the parking lot ap proximately one (1) hour later, he grew irate upon discovering that his vehicle had be en towed. Mr. Jackson provided him with the information concerning the towing company and processes for retrieving the vehicle. At this, the car owner grew even more irat e and started making threats to Mr. Jackson, and was making statements to the effect th at he was going to \"blow the whole place up.\" When the car owner attempted to return t o the mall, Mr. Jackson stopped the individual and advised him that he was no longer al lowed into the mall, given the threatening language and hostile demeanor that he w as using. The vehicle owner attempted to push his way past Mr. Jackson, at whic h point Mr. Jackson used his training and attempted to restrain the individual t o prevent him from entering the mall. A struggle ensued in which the owner of vehicle and Mr. Jackson fell to the ground. Mr. Jackson was able to restrain the individual until l aw enforcement arrived and formally arrested the individual for assault and making terr oristic threats. Mr. Jackson, for his part, sustained an injury to h is left knee. He immediately filled out a report for the employer that detailed his version of events. He then advised his manager that he had sustained an injury to his left knee and would need to go to the hospital. The manager took the report and asked Mr. Jackson to keep them updated on what happens at the emergency room. Upon his arriva l to the emergency room, Mr. Jackson received treatment that included x-rays and a full medical examination. He was advised that in addition to injuring his left knee, he had strained his left shoulder. There were concerns about a partial meniscal tear in the left knee, superimposed on a preexisting arthritic condition in that knee. Mr. J ackson was released from the hospital - 7 -with medications and a referral to an orthopedic sp ecialist for further treatment regarding his injuries. Mr. Jackson updated his manager on what had transpi red at the emergency room and that he intended to follow up with the ref erral that was provided at the emergency room. The next day, Mr. Jackson was calle d into the office for a meeting with upper management. He was advised at that time that he was being terminated for unprofessional conduct, and for violation of the co mpany's rules regarding professionalism. When he asked for further explanat ion, Mr. Jackson was simply advised that his restraint of the hostile patron wa s not authorized or otherwise any part of his job duties, and that his actions had subject ed them to additional liability. It was noted by Mr. Jackson, as he had been advised by the local police officer, that the car owner was in fact being prosecuted for the assault and terroristic threats Mr. Jackson, several days later, was advised that h is claim for workers' compensation benefits was being denied. He then ob tained counsel and filed a Claim Petition seeking benefits. V. INTERPLAY WITH THE WORKERS' COMPENSATION ACT As noted, the Pennsylvania Workers' Compensation Ac t is a humanitarian statute designed to provide expedited wage loss rep lacement and medical coverage to employees injured in the course of and as a result of their employment. Once a compensable work injury occurs, issues often arise with respect to the nature and extent of injury, the extent of wage los s or \"disability,\" and the reasonableness and necessity of proposed medical tr eatment. Since a compensable work injury may result in an ex tended absence from work, the need for wage-loss replacement and the need for job modification to facilitate a return-to-work, the Workers' Compensation Act, the Unemployment Compensation Law, the FMLA 13 , the ADA, Title VII, COBRA, and perhaps even the A ffordable Care Act can all converge upon the human resource manage r responsible for the particular claim. Below, we have addressed those instances where ther e can be interplay between the Pennsylvania Workers' Compensation Act and thes e distinct, but often related statutory regimes. A. THE UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION LAW An injured worker, entitled to disability benefits under the Workers' Compensation Act, may simultaneously recover wage loss benefits under the 13 For an excellent analysis of the interplay of Work ers' Compensation and the ADA and the FMLA, see \"The Employer's 'Bermuda Triangle': An An alysis of the Intersection Between Workers' Compensation, ADA and FMLA,\" Gregory G. Pi nski and Angela L. Rud, 76 North Dakota Law Review, (2000). - 8 -Unemployment Compensation Law where the work injury prevents the employee from performing his or her pre-injury job, but does not prevent him or her from performing other modified work available in the labor market. See Kowal v. Commonwealth, Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, 77 Pa. C mwlth. 378, 465 A.2d 1322 (1983), appeal after remand , 99 Pa. Cmwlth. 234, 512 A.2d 812 (1986). The Unemployment and Workers' Compensation regimes will address the worker's employment status simultaneously, where, f or example, following the occurrence of a compensable work injury, the employ er discharges the worker for alleged disciplinary reasons. In those instances th e two provisions will address the basis for the discharge while applying similar standards. Under the Unemployment Law, the question normally t o be resolved, assuming the employee is otherwise eligible for UC benefits, is whether the discharge resulted from the employee's \"willful misconduct\" or a \"will ful disregard for the employer's policy and rules\" See Brady v. Unemployment Compens ation Board of Review, Pa. Cmwlth. 68, 544 A.2d 1085 (1988); McKeesport Hospit al v. Unemployment Board of Review, 155 Pa. Cmwlth. 267, 625 A.2d 112 (1993). T he phrase \"willful misconduct\" has been defined by the courts as: (1) wanton and willf ul disregard of an employer's interests; (2) deliberate violation of rules; (3) d isregard of the standards of behavior which an employer can rightfully expect from an emp loyee; or, (4) negligence showing an intentional disregard of the employer's interest s or the employee's duties and obligations. Johnson v. Unemployment Comp. Bd. of R eview, 87 A.3d 1006 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2014) (citing Grieb v. Unemployment Comp. Bd. of Re view, 827 A.2d 422 (Pa. 2002)). The employer bears the burden of establishing a claiman t engaged in willful misconduct. Id. When an employment discharge occurs in the context of a workers' compensation claim, the WCJ is asked to determine w hether, through no fault of the employee, he or she has suffered wage loss followin g the occurrence of an otherwise compensable work injury. See Pieper v. Ametek-Ther mox Instruments Div., 526 Pa. 25, 584 A.2d 301 (1990); Vista Int'l Hotel v. Workers' Compensation Appeal Board (Daniels), 560 Pa. 12, 742 A.2d 649 (1999). Specifically, the WCJ is asked to decide whether the post- work injury discharge was prompted by the employee's bad faith conduct . See Stevens v. Workers' Compensation Appeal Board (Consolidated Coal Co.), 563 Pa. 297, 760 A.2d 369 (2000) (injured employee, who was unable to ret urn to work for employer, returns to work for new employer, but is thereafter discharged due to inability to perform new job in acceptable fashion, after having made a good fai th effort to do so, awarded reinstatement of disability benefits). Attorneys for claimants and employers will oftentim es urge before a WCJ that that a UC ruling - adjudicating the employee's alle ged \"willful misconduct\"- should collaterally estop similar assessment by the WCJ - that the WCJ should be bound by the ruling of the UC Referee. It is fairly well-established that \"fault\" sufficie nt to preclude a recovery of disability benefits under the Act is not the equiva lent of \"willful misconduct\" under the Unemployment Compensation Law. Rather, it has been observed, \"there is no support - 9 -for the proposition that the employee's fault in th e workers' compensation contest must rise to the level of 'willful misconduct' in unempl oyment matters.\" That is, \"willful misconduct\" envisions conduct more egre gious than that sufficient to disqualify an injured employee from receiving wage loss benefits under the Act. See Pennsylvania Workers' Compensation Law and Practice , Torrey & Greenberg, Section 6:194 (3 rd Ed. 2008). Citing the different standards of proof and the mor e informal character of UC litigation, the Commonwealth Court has ruled that a UC ruling that the employee did not engage in \"willful misconduct\" will not bind a WCJ charged with determining the compensability of any ensuing wage loss under the W orkers' Compensation Act. Department of Corrections v. Workers' Compensation Appeal Board (Wagner-Stover), 6 A.3d 603 (Pa. v. Appeal Board, 656 A.2d 554 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1995) affirmed 546 Pa. 77, 683 A.2d 259 (1996); Griswold v. Workm en's Compensation Appeal (Thompson Maple Products ), 658 A.2d 449 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1995). 14 It is noteworthy, that prior to August 31, 1993, th e injured worker was eligible to receive both UC and workers' compensation benefits without having to be concerned with any form of credit or off-set. That changed, h owever, with the enactment of \"Act 44 of 1993\" - remedial legislation that was promulgate d for the purpose of reducing the cost of Pennsylvania work injuries 15 . In pursuit of that goal, the Legislature drafted a new provision of the Act - Section 204 - which, for the first time, afforded employers credit for Unemployment Compensation Benefits received by an injured worker, receiving workers' compensation wage loss benefits. The provision, which was further amended by \"Act 57 of 1996,\" now provides, in pertinent part, as follows: \"(a)...I[f] the employe (sic) receives Unemployment Compensation benefits, such amount or amounts so received shall be credited as against the amount of the award made under the provisions of Sections 108 and 306, except for benefits payable under Section 306(c) o r 307. 16 14 Generally, UC determinations have been given littl e deference in other legal forums. See Rue v. K-Mart Corp., 552 Pa. 13, 713 A.2d 82 (1998) (UC finding that employee did not steal bag of potato chips not binding in civil defamation action ). 15 The primary focus of Act 44 was \"medical cost cont ainment.\" Three years later, the Legislature focused its remedial efforts on wage loss benefits through the enactment of Act 57. 16 In Keystone Coal Mining Corp. v. Workmen's Compens ation Appeal Board (Wolfe), 673 A.2d 418 1996) and in Lykins v. Workmen's C ompensation Appeal Board (New Castle Foundry), 552 Pa. 1, 713 A.2d 77 (1998), the Common wealth Court and the Supreme Court ruled respectively that the unemployment credit provision could not be applied to injuries occurring before August 31, 1993, the effective date of Act 4 4. - 10 -Section 123.6(a) of the Act 57 Regulations instruct s that \"workers' compensation benefits otherwise payable shall be off-set by the net amount an employe (sic) receives in UC benefits subsequent to the work-related injur y...\" (emphasis supplied). Although for many years employers calculated the Se ction 204 offset by assessing the employee's gross UC benefit rate, the Commonwealth Court ruled in Philadelphia Gas Works v. Workers' Compensation App eal Board (Amodei), 964 A.2d 963 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2009) that the employer must use t he \"net\" recovery of Unemployment Compensation, Social Security (Old Age ) benefits, severance or pension benefits received by the injured employee in calcul ating the off set. B. THE FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE ACT The FMLA was signed into law by President Bill Clin ton on August 5, 1993 while the FMLA final regulatory rulemaking became effecti ve April 6, 1995. 17 The law, as noted above, \"was promulgated with the intent of preventing employees from having to choose between the jobs th ey need and the families who need them. 18 \" In order to be eligible for FMLA protection, the em ployee must: (1) work for a covered employer; (2) for a total of twelve months; (3) at least 1,250 hours during the preceding twelve months and (4) at a location in th e United States or a United States Territory, where at least fifty employees are emplo yed within seventy-five miles of one another. A covered employee is entitled to twelve weeks of unpaid leave during a twelve month period for: (1) an inability to work due to a \"serious he alth condition;\" (2 to care for an immediate family member such as a spouse, ch ild, or parent suffering from a \"serious health condition;\" (3) the birth or care o f a new child of the employee; or (4) the adoption of a child. In administering employee leave, employers are perm itted to choose one of four methods for determining the twelve-month period during whic h the twelve weeks of an employee's leave entitlement occurs: (1) the \"rolling\" method which calculates the employee's leave year backward from the first date the employee uses any FMLA leave; (2) the \"calendar\" method, which calculates leave in each calendar ye ar; (3) the \"fixed year\" method, which calculates leave on the basis of any fiscal year or a one-year period specified by state law or a one-year period commenc ing on the employee's anniversary 17 On February 15, 2012 the U.S. Department of Labor issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing regulations addressing military leave pro visions, establishing leave eligibility requirements for airline crewmembers and flight att endants and changes concerning calculation of leave. 18 \"The Family and Medical Leave Act,\" Jill M. Lashay , Esquire, Dealing with Current Employment Issues, Pennsylvania Bar Institute, (200 5). - 11 -date and (4) the \"forward\" method, which calculates leave from the first date the employee uses any FMLA leave into the future. 19 It should be noted that leave is calculated using the employer's method for calculating work time, meaning, for example, where the employer records e mployee work time in tenths of hours, it should grant leave in tenths of hours. On January 28, 2008 President George W. Bush signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (\"ND AA\"), that provides additional FMLA protection for military families as follows: ( 1) employers are now required to provide up to twenty-six weeks of unpaid leave to e mployees - son/daughter, spouse, parent, next-of-kin - who are caring for a member o f the Armed Forces wounded in the line of duty; and (2) twelve weeks of unpaid leave is available to an employee for any \"qualifying exigency\" arising out of out of the fac t that the spouse, son, daughter, or parent of the employee is on active duty or has bee n notified of an impending call or order to active duty in the Armed Forces in support of a contingency operation. 1. Basic Application of the FMLA: (a) The protection afforded by the FMLA is general ly triggered by a \"serious health condition,\" or \"an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves either: (1) Inpatient care , i.e. an overnight stay in a hospital, hospice or residential medical-care facility, including any pe riod of incapacity or subsequent treatment in connection with the inpatient care, or (2) Continuing treatment by a health care provider that includes a period of incapacity lasting more than three consecutive, full calendar days and any subsequent treatment or period of incapaci ty that also involves: (a) treatment two or more times within th irty days of the first date of incapacity; (b) treatment by a provider on at least one occasion which results in continuing treatment under the provider's supervisi on; (c) the first treatment, which must involve an in-person visit to the provider, mu st occur within seven days of the first day of incapacity. In addition, the concept of continuing treatment includes: (a) any period of incapacity related to pregnancy; (b) any period of incapacity or treatment for a chronic serious health condition; (c) a period of incapacit y that is permanent or long-term due to a condition for which treatment may not be effectiv e or (d) any absences to receive multiple treatments for restorative surgery or for a condition that would likely result in a period of incapacity of more than three days if n ot treated. Examples 20 of continuing treatment include pregnancy, pre-natal care, severe stroke, terminal cancer, chemotherapy treatments, a sthma and diabetes.21 19 29 CFR \u00a7825.200 (b)(1-4). 20 See \"Everything You Want to Know About the FMLA And More\" Debbie Rodman Sandler, 12th Annual Employment Law Institute, (PBI 2006) at 3-4. 21 Id. - 12 -(b) A \"serious health condition\" under the FMLA is not necessarily the equivalent of a \"disability\" under either the ADA o r the Workers' Compensation Act; (c) When an employee requests leave for a \"serious health condition\" the employer will not violate the ADA by requiring the employee to produce the \"Confirming Certification Form\" prescribed by the F MLA; (d) The employer may require second and third medical opinions assessing the nature of the condition, at its expense. The th ird opinion will be deemed final and binding and will be performed by an agreed upon hea lth care professional. The employer may also require periodic recertification - no more often than every thirty days - of the serious health condition; 22 (e) Where the employee fails to provide a complete and sufficient Certification, the employer may contact his or her health care provider for clarification - through a health care provider, a human resource profession al, a leave coordinator or a management official - but not through the employe e's direct supervisor 23 ; (f) If the employee chooses not to provide the emp loyer with authorization allowing the employer to clarify the Certification with the health care provider and does not otherwise clarify the Certification, the employ er may deny FMLA leave if the certification remains unclear; 24 (g) While the employee seeking FMLA leave should p rovide a thirty-day advance notice, where the leave is foreseeable, the employee need o nly provide notice as soon as practicable where the leave is not fores eeable; (h) The employee has no obligation to specifically use the reference \"FMLA\" when seeking leave. Rather, the act of explaining w hy leave is required may be sufficient under certain circumstances to put the employer on notice of the employee's need for FMLA \"leave,\" e.g. discussing the nature of the medical condition ;25 (i) The employee's need for more than the twelve-w eek leave period afforded by FMLA will be construed in certain insta nces as a request for a \"reasonable accommodation\" under the ADA; (j) The relevant federal regulations permit FMLA \" leave\" to run on the basis of absences attributable to the disabling effects o f a compensable work injury 26 provided 22 See 29 C.F.R.\u00a7 825.307(a)(2). 23 See 29 C.F.R.\u00a7 825.307(a). 24 Id. 25 See \"An Employer's Notice Obligations Under the F amily Medical Leave Act,\" Pamela G. Cochenour, Esquire and Divya Wallace, Esquire, Pie tragallo Special Employment Edition, Summer, 2008. 26 See \"The Employer's 'Bermuda Triangle': An Analysi s of the Intersection Between Workers' Compensation, ADA and FMLA,\" Gregory G. Pinski and Angela L. Rud, 76 North Dakota Law Review, (2000), citing 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.208. - 13 -the employee is properly notified in advance that s uch absences will be counted against FMLA \"leave 27 ;\" (k) While the Workers' Compensation Act does not r equire that the injured employee return to work for the employer in his or her pre-injury capacity or its equivalent, FMLA generally does require such an assignment, unless the employer can demonstrate that the employee would not have remain ed employed in his or her pre- injury job as of the date of reinstatement - due to the elimination of the job - or that the employee is unable to perform the essential functio ns of the pre-injury job, or that the employee is a highly compensated \"key employee\" who se reinstatement would cause the employer substantial and grievous economic inju ry; 28 (l) The employee's use of FMLA leave cannot result in the loss of any benefit that the employee had already earned or was entitle d to receive, before taking the leave 29 and cannot be counted against the employee under a \"no fault\" attendance policy 30 ; (m) While the employee is out on FMLA leave, the employer is required to maintain his or her health insurance coverage on th e same terms as if he or she were still an active employee. For example, if the employer co vers 100% of the employee's health insurance premium, it must continue to do so during FMLA leave. If the employer covers only 50% of the employee's health insurance premium, it must continue to pay the premium at that percentage during the employee' s leave. 2. Practical Considerations for FMLA Administration In their article, \"The Employer's 'Bermuda Triangle ': An Analysis of the Intersection Between Workers' Compensation, ADA and FMLA,\" Gregory G. Pinski and Angela L. Rud offer a series of practical suggestio ns for effectively administering employee leave situations under the FMLA, while bei ng mindful of the obligations set forth in the Workers' Compensation Act and ADA: (a) The employer should always request FMLA certification from an employee at the commencement of an unforeseen leave or immediately following a leave request; (b) The employer should always maintain separate confidential medical examination files from regular personnel files; 27 Notice is provided in three ways: (a) posting a n otice; (b) providing FMLA information in a written handbook or similar document; and/or (c) gi ving the employee notice of his or her specific obligations when the FMLA leave period beg ins. See 29 C.F.R.\u00a7\u00a7 825.300, 825.301. 28 See 29 C.F.R.\u00a7825.312. In order to take advantage of the \"key employee\" provision, the employer must notify the employee of his or her \"ke y employee\" status at the time the leave is requested or as soon as practicable. 29 See \"Everything You Want to Know About the FMLA And More\" Debbie Rodman Sandler, 12th Annual Employment Law Institute, (PBI 2006) at 4. 30 Id. - 14 - (c) Since FMLA leave does not immediately intersec t with the ADA concepts of \"reasonable accommodation,\" and \"undue hardship, \" an employer cannot reduce the twelve-week FMLA entitlement regardless of what imp act it might have upon its business or operations; (d) The FMLA law does not require the employer to provide \"reasonable accommodations\" for a serious health condition. See Baker v. Hunter Douglas, Inc., 270 F. App'x 159, 2008 WL 744734 (3 rd Circuit 2008); (e) After the prescribed twelve-week period expire s, however, ADA principles may be triggered, meaning that the emplo yee may be entitled to additional leave , if the additional time off, would constitute a \"r easonable accommodation\" and would not impose an undue hardship on the employer' s business; (f) Any policy of the employer requiring the emplo yee to achieve a level of fitness sufficient to permit a return to work must be uniformly applied, must be job- related and must be consistent with business necess ity in order to avoid ADA liability. 3. Non-Compensable Work-Related Conditions The FMLA may be implicated in connection with a work-related condition that is not compensable under the Act. For example, where the employee suffers an emotiona l injury that requires treatment, but that does not develop on the basis o f a subjective reaction to an abnormal working condition, and is therefore not a compensab le \"mental-mental\" work injury. See Payes v. Workers' Compensation Appeal Board (Co mmonwealth of Pennsylvania/State Police), 5 A.3d 855 (Pa. Cmwlth 2010)(state trooper whose patrol vehicle struck and killed a confused pedestrian on an interstate highway not entitled to benefits under the Act since not exposed to abnorma l working conditions); McLaurin v. Workers' Compensation Appeal Board (SEPTA), 980 A.2 d 186 (Pa. Cmwlth 2009)(bus driver confronted by passenger brandishing handgun develops post-traumatic stress disorder, but not entitled to benefits under Act si nce not exposed to abnormal working conditions); See Baker v. Hunter Douglas, Inc., 27 0 F.App'x 159, 2008 WL 744734 (3 rd Circuit 2008). (employee suffering from nervous bre akdown due to overwhelming work load requests and receives FMLA leave plus non-work ers' compensation short-term disability benefits); See also Lloyd v. Washington & Jefferson College, 288 F.App'x 786, 2008 WL 2357734 (3 rd Circuit 2008)(associate professor requests and rec eives FMLA leave for stress condition caused by interaction wi th his department chair). - 15 -C. THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT Signed into law on July 26, 1990, by President Geor ge H. W. Bush, the ADA is ambitious legislation that seeks to make American society more accessible to individuals with disabilities .31 It has been observed that the ADA was enacted to me et four goals for individuals suffering from physical or emotional di sabilities: (1) equal opportunity; (2) full participation in community; (3) independent li ving and (4) economic self- sufficiency. 32 In the twenty-five years that have passed since the enactment of the statute, gains have been made in access to public services, enviro nmental changes, such as the construction of cross-walk \"curb cuts\" for wheelcha ir access and general public awareness and sensitivity toward the talents and ab ilities of individuals with impairments. 33 Still, there remain disparities for individuals wit h disabilities in generation of income, access to employment, housing, education, t ransportation, access to the internet, and as a result of the foregoing, poorer health. 34 The Act is divided into five \"Employment,\" \"Public Services,\" \"Public Accommodations,\" \"Telecommunications,\" and \"Miscell aneous.\" The protection afforded by the ADA applies not only to individuals who are \"disabled 35 ,\" but also to those perceived as being disabled. 31 Whether the ADA has made the work place more acces sible to individuals suffering from physical and emotional disabilities is subject to d ebate. In their paper \"Consequences of Employment Protection? The Case of the Americans wi th Disabilities Act\" published in the Journal of Political Economy, 2001, Daron Acemoglu and Joshua D. Angrist argue that because of increased costs to employers, the ADA has had a neg ative effect on the employment of disabled men of all ages and disabled women under the age of forty. They have also reported that the ADA has had no effect on the wages of disabled work ers - those remain approximately 40 percent below the wages of non-disabled individuals . The authors also report that from 1992 through 1997 the Equal Opportunity Employment Commi ssion received more than 90,000 discrimination complaints. Of this total, 29 percen t of the charges filed were for failure to provide reasonable accommodations, 10 percent for hiring vi olations and nearly 63 percent for wrongful termination. During that time period employers paid over $174 million in EEOC settlements under the ADA. 32 See \"Health Care For Americans with Disabilities - 25 Years after the ADA\" The New England Journal of Medicine, September 3, 2015, Peacock, Ie zzoni & Harkin. 33 See \"Health Care For Americans with Disabilities - 25 Years after the ADA\" The New England Journal of Medicine, September 3, 2015, Peacock, Ie zzoni & Harkin. 34 Id. 35 As discussed in detail below, the United States Sup reme Court narrowed the definition of \"disability\" in Sutton v. United Airlines, 527 U.S. 471 (1999) and Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184 (2002) by allowing consideration of mitigating or ameliorative measures, and by insisting that the af fected major life activity be limited - 16 - Indeed, a person will receive ADA protection if he or she meets at least one of the following tests: (1) he or she has a physical or mental impairment that \"substantially limits 36 one or more major life activities \" - an \"actual\" disability; (2) he or she has a \"record of\" such impairment; or (3) he or she is regarded as having such an impairment , e.g. where an employer takes action prohibited by the ADA because of an actual or perceived impairment that is not both tra nsitory and minor.37 In addition, individuals, not directly afflicted with, or perceived as being afflicted with, a physical or mental impairment, ca n receive ADA protection, where for example: (1) the person has an effective associati on with an individual known to have a disability, such as a parent or (2) the person may be subject to coercion or retaliation for assisting people with disabilities seeking to asser t their rights under the ADA. 1. The ADA Amendments Act of 2008 On September 25, 2008, President George W. Bush, si gned the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (\"ADAAA\") substantially expa nding the coverage afforded by the ADA . The ADAAA, which became effective on January 1, 200 9, 38 significantly broadens the ADA definition of \"disability\" - in response to several holdings by the United States Supreme Court and certain Regulations issued by the EEOC. While the ADAAA retains the basic definition of \"di sability\" set forth above, the new law reflects the intent of Congress to decisive ly broaden ADA coverage 39 in response to the narrower definition of \"disability\" set forth by the Supreme Court in \"significantly\" or \"to a large degree.\" The Supreme Court rulings ultimately prompted the enactment of the ADAAA described below. 36 As noted below the ADAAA has instructed that the t erm \"substantially limits\" be construed broadly in favor of expansive coverage. 37 See Eshelman v. Agere Systems, Inc., 554 F.3d 426 (3 rd Cir. 2009)(Employee returns to work on a part-time basis following an FMLA leave during whic h she received treatment for breast cancer. She informs her supervisors that her chemotherapy t reatment has resulted in a cognitive dysfunction. As a consequence of a difficult econom ic environment the employer lays off 18,000 employees worldwide. In response to her supervisor' s suggestion that she move to another facility, the employee refuses, citing the memory p roblems she was experiencing. Immediately thereafter her lay-off score is adjusted thereby su bjecting her to a lay-off. In affirming an award under the ADA, the Third Circuit agrees that the em ployer regarded the employee as hindered in her ability to think. 38 The ADAAA does not apply retroactively to discrimi natory acts that occurred before January 1, 2009 39 For an excellent summary of the ADAAA see \"Congres s Redefines the Scope of Disability Rights under the ADA\", Marie M. Joes, Esquire and J ames D. Miller, Esquire, Meyer, Darragh, Buckler, Bebneck & Eck, P.L.L.C., Pittsburgh, PA, C ounterpoint, Pennsylvania Defense Institute (January, 2009). - 17 -Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Willi ams, 534 U.S. 184 (2002) 40 and Sutton v. United Airlines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471 (1999 ): (a) The ADAAA expands the definition of \"major life activities\" by including two non-exhaustive lists. The first list includes a variety of activities of daily living ,41 including \"caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, heari ng, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, le arning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working.\" (\"writing\" h as also been added as an example of a major life activity in \u00a7\u00a7 35.108(c) and 36.105 (c). based on the Department of Justice's Final Rule, effective October 11, 2016). The second list includes major bodily functions e.g., \"functions of the immune system, normal cell growth, digestive, bowel, bladd er, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive functions. \" (b) The ADAAA instructs that the term \"substanti ally limits\" should be construed broadly in favor of expansive coverage - the analysis may include, if relevant, the \"condition,\" the \"manner\" and the \"duration\" in which a major life activity can be performed in determining whether the subject impair ment is a disability; (c) The ADAAA Regulations identify specific types of im pairments that should easily be construed as disabilities that substantia lly limit major life activities: deafness, blindness, intellectual disability, partially or co mpletely missing of limbs, mobility impairments requiring use of wheelchair, autism, ca ncer, cerebral palsy, diabetes, epilepsy, HIV infection, multiple sclerosis, muscul ar dystrophy, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress d isorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia and attention-deficit/hyper activity disorder (ADHD); (d) The ADAAA clarifies that an impairment that is epis odic or in remission is a \"disability\" if it substantially limits a major l ife activity when active , e. g. epilepsy, hypertension, asthma, diabetes, major depressive di sorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia; (e) The ADAAA makes clear that the positive effects of mitigating measures, 42 other than \"ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses \" shall not be considered in assessing whether an individual suffers from a \"disability\" f or ADA purposes. By drafting the ADAAA in such a manner, Congress speci fically rejected the Supreme Court's reasoning in Sutton v. United Airlines , 527 U.S. 471 (1991) while instructing that conditions be analyzed \"without regard to the ameli orative effects of mitigating measures, such as medication, medical supplies or e quipment, prosthetics, assistive 40 Id. 41 Id. 42 Such as medication, medical equipment, prosthetic limbs, low vision devices, hearing aids, mobility devices, oxygen therapy equipment, physica l therapy, psychotherapy, learned behavioral or adaptive neurological modifications. - 18 -technology, reasonable accommodations or auxiliary aids, or behavioral or adaptive neurological modifications.\" Other determinations - including the need for reaso nable accommodation and whether an individual poses a significant risk of h arm to self or others - can take into account both the positive and negative effects of a mitigating measure, e.g. a person with epilepsy may no longer need permission for uns cheduled breaks as a reasonable accommodation after switching to a different medica tion that completely controls seizures; (f) The ADAAA provides that an individual subjecte d to an action prohibited by the ADA such as a failure to hire bec ause of an actual or perceived impairment, will meet the \"regarded as\" definition of disability, unless the impairment is transitory and minor; (g) The ADAAA provides that individuals covered o nly under the \"regarded as\" prong are not entitled to reasonable accommodations. (h) The ADAAA and the regulations specifically st ate that changes to the ADA do not alter the standards for determining elig ibility for benefits under State workers' compensation laws or under Federal and Sta te disability benefit programs. 2. What is Not a Disability Under the ADA? The advent of the ADAAA begs the question, what con ditions or impairments are not \"disabilities\" under the ADA? First, it should be understood that ordinary person ality traits such as irritability, poor judgment or chronic lateness are not \"disabili ties\" under the ADA. In addition, the following enumerated conditions ar e not covered by ADA: a. Pregnancy; b. Illegal Use of Drugs; Resulting Psychoactive Su bstance Abuse Disorders; 43 c. Alcoholism 44 ; d. Homosexuality, Bisexuality e. Transvestism, Transsexualism; 43 An individual who has completed a supervised drug rehabilitation program and is no longer engaging in the illegal use of drugs or who is part icipating in such a program and is no longer engaging in the illegal use of drugs shall not othe rwise exclude the employee as a qualified individual with a disability. 44 See 42 U.S.C. \u00a712114. - 19 - f. Pedophilia, Exhibitionism, Voyeurism, Gender Ide ntification Disorders; g. Compulsive Gambling, Kleptomania; h. Pyromania 45 3. Comparing \"Disability\" Under the ADA and the Act Since both the ADA and the Workers' Compensation Ac t seek to identify and, in various ways, ameliorate the consequences of a \"dis ability,\" the reader should be mindful of how the word is defined and addressed un der each statutory scheme. Under the Pennsylvania Workers' Compensation Act th e word \"disability\" is a term of art that does not address simply the physic al and/or emotional ability of the injured worker to function or to engage in gainful employment. Rather, the term is composed of two elements - \"work injury\" and \"wage loss.\" In other words, for an employee to be \"disabled\" under the Act, he or she must suffer a work injury that results in a corresponding wage loss, i.e. \"injury + wage loss = disability.\" Dillon v. Workmen's Compensation Appeal Board (Greenwhich Col lieries), Pa. 490, 640 A.2d 386 (1994); Howze v. Appeal Electric Co.), 714 A.2d 1140 (Pa Cmwlth. 1998). Accordingly, where th e employee suffers a work injury and only a partial wage loss, he or she will be dee med to be \"partially disabled\" while the employee who suffers a work injury and a corres ponding total wage loss will be deemed to \"totally disabled.\" Under the ADA, the concept of \"disability\" does not include an economic component, but refers to actual or perceived physical or emoti onal impairment , without immediate regard for any corresponding wage loss. In Lloyd v. Washington & Jefferson College, supra, a college professor, after having been granted FLMA coverage for the effects o f work stress and agoraphobia, was found not to have presented a \"disability\" under th e ADA because despite his emotional condition he remained capable of working and teachi ng on campus three days per week, and remained capable of serving as a councilman, en gaging in family and social outings and spending weekend hours working on IT projects a nd course development. In dismissing the professor's ADA lawsuit by summary j udgment, the Third Circuit agreed that his alleged inability to be on campus more tha n three days per week was not sufficient to establish that he was substantially l imited in a major life activity. 46 4. Convergence of the Act and the ADA 45 See 42 U.S.C. \u00a712211. 46 The reader should note that the case was decided b efore the enactment of the ADAAA. - 20 -The following are some general rules to remember wh en the Workers' Compensation Act and the ADA converge on a particul ar claim or employee: (a) Not everyone with an occupational injury has a \"disability\" as defined by the ADA, i.e. in the rare instance, an occupational injury might not be severe enough to \"substantially limit a major life activity;\" (b) An employer may ask a prospective employee to undergo a physical examination to obtain information about the existen ce or nature of a prior occupational condition, but only after providing a conditional offer of employm ent so long as the employer requires all entering employees in the sam e job category to have a medical examination ; (c) Before making a conditional offer of employmen t the employer may not obtain information about an applicant's prior worke rs' compensation history from former employers, state workers' compensation agenc ies or services that provide such information; (d) An employer may ask a prospective employee abo ut a prior workers' compensation claim only after providing a condition al offer of employment; (e) The ADA requires confidentiality of the injured worker's occupational injury and workers' compensation claim; (f) An employer may not prevent the employee suffe ring from an occupational disability from returning to work simp ly because it believes that the employee poses some increased risk of re-injury or will increase its workers' compensation costs, unless the employer can demonstrate that the employee pose s a \"direct threat,\" or, a \" significant risk of substantial harm that cannot be lowered or eliminated by a reasonable accommodation; \" (g) The employer cannot condition a return to work on t he occupationally injured employee's ability to work on a full-duty b asis, if the disability prevents him or her from performing only marginal functions of t he position, or if a reasonable accommodation will allow him to him or her to perfo rm the essential functions of the job ; (h) An employer may not refuse to permit an injure d employee from returning to work simply because the workers' compe nsation system has declared the worker to be \"totally disabled,\" or to be suffering from a \"permanent disability;\" (i) An employer may not fire an injured worker who is temporarily unable to work because of an occupational injury, where a reasonable accommodation can be made and will not pose an undue hardship 47 for the employer; 47 An \"undue hardship\" is one that causes the employe r significant difficulty or expense - one that would be unduly costly, disruptive or one that would fundamentally alter the nature or - 21 - (j) As a reasonable accommodation, the employer ma y be required to reallocate job duties for the injured worker, that involve marginal functions of the job that the employee is incapable of performing; (k) The employer is under no obligation to create a new position for the injured employee or bump another employee where the re is no vacancy for an injured employee who can no longer perform the essential fu nctions of his or her pre-injury job ; (l) But the employer must re-assign the employee t o a new position that is comparable to the pre-injury position if there is a vacancy for which the employee is qualified 48 , or if there is an available lower graded position , absent any undue hardship to the employer; (m) The employer is permitted to modify a position - a modification that would not qualify as required reasonable accommodat ion - in order to reduce workers' compensation costs - meaning that the ADA does not prohibit the employer from creating a light-duty position for the injured empl oyee ; (n) The ADA does not require the creation of a light-duty job f or a non- occupationally injured employee, but if the employe r reserves light-duty positions for occupationally injured employees, it must also make such positions available for non-occupationally injured employees, if a position is vacant; (o) If the employer has temporary light-duty work for t he occupationally injured worker, it need not provide the worker with a permanent light-duty job; and (p) The workers' compensation \"exclusive remedy pr ovision\" does not preclude the employee from pursuing an ADA claim ag ainst the employer 49 . 5. ADA Component to the Act? Section 306(b)(2) of the Act contains language that appears to encourage a form of \"reasonable accommodation\" by instructing, in p ertinent part, that \"[i]f the employer has a specific job vacancy the employe (sic) is cap able of performing, the employer shall offer such job to the employe (sic).\" operation of the business. See \"Employers' Obligat ions to Applicants and Employees Pursuant to Title I of the ADA\" Jeffrey L. Braff, Esquire, 12th Annual Employment Law Institute (PBI 2006). 48 See discussion below addressing unsettled question of whether the employer is obligated to award the vacant position to the disabled employee over more qualified applicants. 49 Where the injured employee returns to work for anot her employer in a modified capacity, only to be discharged by the new employer in violation o f the ADA, the employer liable for the reinstatement of total disability benefits will not be permitted to assert a subrogation lien against any ADA award the injured worker might obtain from the discharging employer. See Brubacher Excavating, Inc. v. Workers' Compensation Appeal Bo ard (Bridges), 774 A.2d 1274 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2001). - 22 - Indeed, under the longstanding Pennsylvania common law tradition, employers of injured workers have not only been responsible f or the payment of wage loss benefits and medical coverage, but have also been responsible for re-introducing t he worker into the labor market , by locating and referring suitable open and availab le employment. See Kachinski v. Workmen's Compensation Appeal Boar d (Vepco Construction), 516 Pa. 240, 532 A.2d 374 (1987). And yet it appears that an employer could face ADA liability following the occurrence of a compensable work injury, by refusin g to bring an injured employee back to work in an available job, comparable to the pre- injury job, while retaining the services of a vocational specialist to perform either a Kach inski job search or labor market analysis. See Cleveland v. Policy Management Systems Corporation, 119 S. Ct. 1597 (1999)(United States Supreme Court rules that indiv idual's receipt of Social Security Disability benefits does not estop him or her from prosecuting an ADA claim i.e. an individual who has received Social Security Disabil ity benefits is not necessarily precluded from arguing that he or she is a \"qualifi ed individual with a disability\" under the ADA, suggesting that a claimant receiving worke rs' compensation benefits could, under certain circumstances, prosecute an ADA claim ).50 See also EEOC \"Guidance on the Effect of Disability Representations in Benefit s applications on ADA Coverage\" in 1997, instructing that representations made in appl ications for Social Security, workers' compensation and other disability benefits should n ot automatically bar an ADA claim. 51 6. THE LAW OF \"REASONABLE ACCOMODATION\"52 The duty to make \"reasonable accommodations\" to qua lified individuals with disabilities is considered one of the most importan t features of the ADA. In order to facilitate this fundamental process, the ADA may re quire the restructuring of jobs by reallocating or reassigning marginal job functions, modifying work schedules, altering of the lay-out of work stations, and/or mo difying work equipment .53 It is important to understand that the notion of \"r easonable accommodation\" contemplates the removal of workplace barriers, meaning that non-workplace barriers generally do not fall within the employer's reasona ble accommodation obligation. 50 See \"The Employer's 'Bermuda Triangle': An Analys is of the Intersection Between Workers' Compensation, ADA and FMLA,\" Gregory G. Pinski and Angela L. Rud, 76 North Dakota Law Review, (2000), citing Haschmann v. Time Warner Entertainment Co. 151 F.3 d 591 (7 th Cir. 1998) (the court refuses to adopt a per se rule precludin g a plaintiff from asserting an ADA claim while receiving disability payments) and McNemar v. Disne y Store, Inc., 91 F.3d 610 (3 rd . Cir. 1996) (an individual's representation to the Social Security Administration that he was disabled and unable to work barred his subsequent ADA claim.) 51 Id. 52 The authors are grateful to David K. Fram, Esquire of the National Employment Law Institute for allowing the use of select texts from his paper \" Resolving ADA-Workplace Questions \" (NELI 2008). 53 Id. - 23 -Workplace barriers may be physical, such as inaccessible facilities or equipment, or \"procedural,\" e.g. rules concerning when or where work is perfor med, when breaks are taken, when leave is given, or how tasks are to be accomplished. The ADA, the EEOC and the courts have identified th e following accommodations that an employer may be required to provide: job restructuring; part- time or modified work schedules; reassignment to a vacant position; acquiring or modifying equipment; changing exams, training mater ials, or policies and providing qualified readers or interpreters . See 42 U.S.C. 12111(9); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(o)(2). It is also important to understand that a \"reasonab le accommodation\" can involve a \"preference\" for an employee with a disability so she or he can \"obtain the same workplace opportunities that those without disabilities automatically enjo y.\" U.S. Airways, Ins. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 122 S. Ct. 1516 (2002)(\"by definition any special 'accommodation' requires the employer to treat an e mployee with a disability differently, i.e. preferentially\"). In Holly v. Cla irson Industries, LLC, 492 F.3d 1247 (11 th Cir. 2007), the court observed that \"the very purpo se of reasonable accommodation laws is to require employers to treat disabled individua ls differently in some circumstances - namely, when different treatment would allow a disa bled individual to perform the essential functions of his position by accommodatin g his disability without posing an undue hardship on the employer.\" There are three general categories of reasonable accommodation: (a) Changes to the job application process so that a qualified applicant with a disability can be considered for the job; (b) Modifications to the work environment - including how, when or where a job is performed - so that a qualified individual with a disability can perform the job; and (c) Changes so that an employee with a disability can enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment. The EEOC has taken the position that an employer ma y need to provide a reasonable accommodation even if the individual doe s not require one in order to perform the essential functions of the particular j ob assignment. For example, the EEOC argued in one case that even though the employee wa s able to perform her essential functions as a software engineer, the employer had to consider allowing her to work at home because her doctor felt this would be \"advisab le\" in light of complications she was experiencing following cancer surgery. See EEOC's Brief in Rauen v. U.S. Tobacco, No. 01-3973 (Brief filed in Seventh Circuit, 8/9/02). A. Unpaid Leave As noted above, unpaid leave may be a reasonable ac commodation in certain instances. See Appendix to 29 C.F.R. \u00a7160.2(o); EE OC Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship. No. 9 15.002 (10/17/02) at Question - 24 -16. For example, where an individual is recovering from an illness, or taking some other action in connection with his or her disability, su ch as training a guide dog. As noted above, while there is general agreement th at unpaid leave can be a reasonable accommodation, there has been some disag reement as to whether the employee's job must be held open on an indefinite b asis. See EEOC Fact Sheet: \"The FMLA, the ADA, and Title VII of the Civil Rights Ac t of 1964\" at p. 7 (Question 14), and EEOC Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodati on and Undue Hardship, No. 915.002 (10/17/02) at Question 18. Most courts have held that an employer need not provide indefinite leave as a reasonable accommodation. See Krensavage v. Bayer Corp ., 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 1290 (3d Cir. 2008) (unpublished)(\"open-ended disability leave\" is not a reasonable accommodation where there is no \"expected duration\" for the leave.); Fogelman v. Greater Hazleton Health Alliance, 2004 U.S. App. LE XIS 26861 (3d Cir. 2004) (unpublished)(although leave is an accommodation wh en it would enable the individual to perform essential functions \"within a reasonable amount of time,\" leave \"for an indefinite and open-ended period of time\" does \" no t constitute a reasonable accommodation.\") B. Job Restructuring \"Job restructuring\" typically means modifying the e mployee's job in order to reallocate or redistribute non-essential job functi ons , or altering when and/or how a function of the job is performed. 42 U.S.C. \u00a712111 (9)(B); 29 C.F.R. \u00a71630.2(o)(2)(ii), Appendix. But, job restructuring can also involve changing the way essential functions have traditionally been performed . For example, in EEOC v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 4 77 F.3d 561 (8 th Cir. 2007), the court held that the employer may h ave been able to accommodate the plaintiff, suffering from cerebral palsy, by allowing him to use certain equipment such as a wheelchair, scooter, and hand s canner while working as a greeter or cashier. C. Transitional Duty Since an employer is not required to reallocate essential functions , it is not required to create a new job , such as a transitional or light duty job that rel ieves the employee from having to perform his or her essentia l job functions. See Haines v. Bethlehem Lukens Plate Steel, 2001 U.S. App. LEXIS 24678 (3d Cir. 2001) (unpublished)( court notes that \"an employer is not required to cr eate a light duty position for the disabled employee\" while holding t hat \"assignment to an existing permanent light duty position is a reasonable accom modation\"). If, however, the employer has existing light duty j obs - as many employers do - it may be required to re-assign the disabled employee to one of those jobs if re- assignment is required as a reasonable accommodatio n. For example, in Howell v. Michelin Tire Corp., 860 F. Supp. 1488 (M.D. Ala. 1 994), the court stated that re- assignment to an existing vacant light-duty job is a reasonable accommodation for - 25 -someone who cannot perform his original job anymore because of a disability. Similarly, the EEOC has taken the position that \"if an employer already had a vacant light duty position for which an injured worker is qualified, it might be a reasonable accommodation to re-assign the worker to that posit ion.\" EEOC Technical Assistance Manual, Ch. 9.4. One question that is commonly raised is whether an employer is permitted to create a light duty job for only a temporary period of time. The EEOC has stated that \"an employer is free to determine that a light duty position will be temporary rather than permanent.\" EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Workers' Compensation and the ADA, in Graves v. Finch Pruyn & Co., 457 F.3d 181 ( 2d Cir. 2006). In Shiring v. Runyon, 90 F.3d 827 (3d Cir. 1996), an injured mail carrier could not physically deliver the mail. The U. S. Postal Servi ce created a temporary job for him that required him to sort the mail, but not deliver it. Later, when it became clear that the employee would be unable to return to a delivery po sition, the plaintiff claimed, among other things, that the employer was obligated to al low him to continue performing the light-duty assignment. The court disagreed, explain ing that the employer had no obligation to create a permanent job simply because it had agreed to create the light- duty job in order \"to give [the plaintiff] somethin g to do on a temporary basis.\" See also Mengine v. Runyon, 114 F.3d 415 (3d Cir. 1997)(U.S. Postal Service \"not required to transform its temporary light duty jobs into perman ent jobs\" in order to accommodate the employee.) D. Reserving Light-Duty Jobs for Occupational Injur ies A difficult question is whether an employer can res erve light-duty jobs for only on-the-job-injuries . An argument can be made that such a policy does not violate the ADA because it does not discriminate based upon disability, but discriminates based upon where the employee was injured. The EEOC has stated that an employer may create light duty positions solely for employees who are injured on the job . EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Workers' Compensation and the ADA, No. 915.002 (9/3/96), at p. 20. The EEOC has also taken the position, however, that an employer cannot reserve existing light duty jobs for on-the-job injuries , but must consider re-assigning any disabled employee, including those suffering from n on-occupational injuries, to such an existing job if it is vacant and if it is required by the employee as a reasonable accommodation. EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Workers ' Compensation and the ADA, No. 915.002 (9/3/96), at p. 22. This Guidance is available on the internet at www.eeoc.gov . More recently, the EEOC stated in an informal guida nce letter, that \"[w]hether a policy of creating light duty positions for employe es who are injured on the job while not creating the same for employees with disabiliti es that are not caused by work- - 26 -related injuries would have an adverse impact on em ployees with disabilities must be determined on a case-by-case basis .54 Indeed, employers should keep in mind that disabili ty-rights advocates are likely to challenge these policies using a \"disparate impa ct\" argument i.e. the policy has a disparate impact against certain types of disabilit ies that are not typically workplace injuries, such as cancer and AIDS. In addition, th e practice of reserving light-duty work for occupational injuries only might be challenged under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 since such a program might discriminate aga inst pregnant women. E. Changing an Employee's Supervisor The EEOC has stated an employer is not required to change an employee's supervisor as a reasonable accommodation . EEOC Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship, No. 915.002 (10/17/02) at Question 33. In Steinmetz v. Potter (USPS), 2005 EEOPUB LEXIS 59 99 (EEOC 2005), the EEOC held that \"an employer does not have to provide an employee with a new supervisor as a reasonable accommodation.\" In Ozlek v. Potter, 20 07 U.S. App. LEXIS 29483 (3d Cir. 2007) (unpublished), the court similarly ruled that the employee was not entitled to a transfer to a new supervisor as a reasonable accomm odation. F. Work-at-Home A question that is oftentimes raised in the contex t of a disabled employee is whether attendance at the employer's work site is a non-essential function of the job. 55 That determination can be crucial since an employe e will not be deemed \"qualified\" under ADA, or entitled to a reasonable accommodation, where a regular and predictable work schedule on site is an essential f unction of the job assignment. Recently, in Fischer v. Pepper Hamilton, No. 15-024 13, 2016 U. S. Dist. Lexis 10603 (E.D. PA 1/29/16), the U. S District Court fo r the Eastern District of Pennsylvania ruled that regular on-site attendance by a contract ed \"project\" attorney may not necessarily constitute an \"essential function\" of t he attorney's work duties where the attorney has been unable to report to work in a tim ely fashion due to a purported \"delayed sleep phase syndrome.\" See also Miller v. University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, 350 Fed. App. 727 (3d Cir. Pa. 2009)(on sit e attendance by hospital emergency room technician deemed an essential function of the job). 54 See January 28, 2000 Informal Guidance letter issu ed by Christopher J. Kuczynski, Assistant Legal Counsel. 55 See \"Regular On-Site Attendance an Essential Funct ion of Lawyer's Job\" by Sid Steinberg, Esquire, The Legal Intelligencer , February 13, 2016. - 27 -The court in Miller, supra, explained that actual a ttendance, on site, will be construed as an essential function of the job where the work requires face-to-face interaction with co-employees or customers or requi res the use of equipment or other materials available only on site. If on site attendance constitutes an essential func tion of the job, an employee's purported inability to appear on site due to a disa bility will generally not qualify the employee for a \"work-at-home\" accommodation. Still, where on site attendance is not an essential function of the job, the EEOC and most courts take the position that the actual physical location of the job performance is a work component that may have to be modified as a reasonable accommodation . In Woodruff v. Peters, 482 F.3d 521 (D.C. Cir. 20 07), for example the court ruled that work-at-home could be a possible r easonable accommodation for an employee who supervised a team that was allegedly \" self-directed,\" since the agency's handbook anticipated telecommuting for up to five d ays per week, and the employee had been working at home for part of each week for several months. In EEOC v. Spectacor Management Group, Civ. Act. N o. 95-2688 (E.D. Pa., Settled: 6/95), the EEOC maintained that the emplo yer was obligated to provide the opportunity to work at home as a reasonable accommo dation. In that case, the employee allegedly needed to do so in order to receive medic al treatment for his AIDS condition. See also EEOC's Brief in Rauen v. U.S. Tobacco, No. 01-3973 (Brief filed in Seventh Circuit 8/9/02)(EEOC urges that \"home office\" may b e a required accommodation for employee whose doctor suggested that it would be \"a dvisable\" because of complications from her cancer surgery, even though the employee c ould perform the job's essential functions in the office.) Finally, the EEOC has stated in its \"EEOC Enforceme nt Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship, No. 915.002\" (10/ 17/02) at Question 34, that an employer \"must modify its policy concerning where w ork is performed\" to allow an employee to work at home if this accommodation is e ffective and would not cause an undue hardship. G. Modifying Work Schedule An employer may be required to modify a disabled e mployee's work schedule as a reasonable accommodation. 42 U.S.C. 12111(9); 29 C.F.R. \u00a71630.2(o)(2)(ii). There seems to be general agreement that a work sch edule can include a number of modifications, such as altering arrival/d eparture times, providing periodic breaks during the day or modifying the times for th e performance of certain functions. The fundamental question that must be addressed in such instances, as noted above, is whether a regular work schedule is an ess ential function of the job. - 28 -In Conneen v. MBNA America Bank, N.A., 334 F.3d 31 8 (3d Cir. 2003), the employer argued that arriving at work at 8:00 a.m. was an essential function of the job of a Marketing Production Manager, since managers must set a good example for other employees. The employer argued that the employee w as not qualified under ADA where she was unable to report to work until 9:00 a .m. because of the impact of her depression. The court held that \"setting a good ex ample\" was not sufficient to render the 8:00 am schedule \"essential,\" thereby permittin g the modified schedule as a reasonable accommodation. H. Job Re-Assignment The courts have consistently held that an employer must, in certain circumstances actually re-assign the impaired employee as a reasonable accommodation, based on the clear language of the s tatute. 42 U.S.C. \u00a712111(9)(B). This is one of the provisions that distinguish the ADA f rom the Rehabilitation Act (prior to the 1992 amendments to the Rehabilitation Act, whic h made it consistent with the ADA). Under the pre-amendment Rehabilitation Act, some co urts held that reasonable accommodation did not include re-assignment. In Haines v. Bethlehem Lukens Plate Steel, 2001 U. S. App. LEXIS 24678 (3d Cir. 2001) (unpublished), the court noted that re-assign ment to an existing position is a reasonable accommodation. In that case, the plaint iff alleged that a vacant, permanent light duty position existed with the employer. In Shapiro v. Township of Lakewood, 292 F.3d 356 (3d Cir. 2002), the court held that th e employer could not refuse a re- assignment request under the ADA simply because the request did not adhere to the employer's policy requiring employees to formally a pply for specific openings. The Third Circuit has ruled that when an employee brings a \"failure-to-transfer\" claim against the employer, he or she bears the bur den of establishing: (1) there was a vacant, funded position; (2) the position was at or below the level of the employee's former job and (3) the employee was qualified to pe rform the essential duties of the vacant job with reasonable accommodations. Mengine v. Runyon, 114 F.3d 415, 417 (3d Cir. 1997); Donahue v. Consolidated Rail Corp, 224 F.3d 226, 230 (3d Cir. 2000). 56 An interesting question that has yet to be resolved is whether the disabled employee seeking a re-assignment must compete with other qualified non-disabled individuals for the sought-after vacant position. 57 56 The authors wish to thank Tiffanie C. Benfer, Esqu ire for the use of her analysis and discussion of various reassignment issues under the ADA, in he r excellent article, \"Does a Disabled Employee Seeking a Reassignment Have to Compete wit h the Rest of the Applicant Pool? Maybe!\" Tiffanie C. Benfer, Esquire, Hill Wallack, LLP, Quarterly Newsletter, Volume 19, Number 1. 57 Id. The United States Supreme Court has ruled that a reassignment is unreasonable if it violates the employer's established seniority system. U.S. A irways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 122 S. Ct. 1516 (2002). - 29 -Some courts have ruled that the ADA does not requir e the employer to turn away a more qualified candidate in order to accommo date a disabled employee. Huber v. Wal-Mart , 486 F.3 rd 480 (8 th Cir. 2007). Some courts have ruled to the contrary - that the ADA does require the employer to award a vacant position to the disabled employee even if the employee is less qualified for the posi tion than other applicants. See Aka v. Washington Hospital, 156 F.3 rd 1284 (10 th Cir. 1998). I. Salary/Benefits of Reassigned Employee There appears to be general agreement that the empl oyer has no obligation to provide the reassigned employee his or her original salary, or to maintain his or her original benefits, if the position to which the emp loyee has been reassigned pays a lower salary. The EEOC has indicated that in cases of reassignmen t to lower-level positions, an employer is not required to maintain the reassigned individual at the salary of the higher graded position if it does not so maintain r eassigned employees who do not have disabilities. EEOC Enforcement Guidance on Reasona ble Accommodation and Undue Hardship, No. 915.002 (10/17/02) at Question 30. C ourts have reached this same result. For example, as noted earlier, in Jenkins v. Cleco Power LLC, 487 F.3d 309 (5 th Cir. 2007), the court held that a reassigned disabled employee has no right \"to receive the same compensation as he received previously.\" Similarly , in Cassidy v. Detroit Edison Co., 138 F.3d 629 (6 th Cir. 1998), the court specifically noted that if a comparable position is not available, the employer may reassign the employ ee to \"a lower grade and paid position.\" If, however, the employer agrees to pay employees w ithout disabilities their higher salary or original benefits package followin g reassignments to lower-level positions (for example, in connection with a plant closing), it should do the same for employees with disabilities (or risk a disparate tr eatment lawsuit). 7. THE MECHANICS OF \"REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS\" A. The Employee's Obligation to Request the Reasona ble Accommodation. The generally accepted rule is that a disabled indi vidual must request an accommodation. Indeed, the EEOC has stated, that, in general, \" it is the responsibility of the individual with a disability to inform the employer than an accommodation is needed .\" Appendix to 29 C.F.R. \u00a71630.9; EEOC Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship, No. 915.002 (10/1 7/02) at \"General Principles\" - 30 -and In Williams v. James (OPM), 2004 EEOPUB LEXIS 999 (EEOC 2004), the EEOC stated that \"an individual with a disability s hould request a reasonable accommodation when she knows that there is a barrie r that is preventing her from performing the job.\" The EEOC did not find it an a cceptable excuse that the employee did not disclose her disability (HIV) and need for accommodation (a modified schedule) because she \"was afraid of being judged.\" The EEOC's internal procedures on reasonable accomm odation provide, however, that the employee may request an accommoda tion \"from his/her supervisor; another supervisor or manager in his/her immediate chain of command; the Office Director; or the Disability Program Manager.\" Inte rnal EEOC \"Procedures for Providing Reasonable Accommodation for Individuals with Disab ilities\" (2/2001) at II. B. Content of Employee's Request for Reasonable Acc ommodation The general rule is that the employee need not utter magic words in order to perfect a valid request for reasonable accommodatio n under the ADA. In the past, the EEOC has maintained that, \"if an employee requests time off for a reason or possibly related to a disability e.g. ' I need six weeks off to get treatment for a back problem' the employer should consider th is a request for ADA reasonable accommodation as well as FMLA leave.\" See EEOC Fact Sheet: \"The FMLA, the ADA, and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\" at p . 8 (question 16). This Fact Sheet is available on the internet at www.eeoc.gov . The courts have similarly endorsed the proposition that the employee need not articulate certain \"magic\" language such as \"reason able accommodation\" in order to perfect a valid request . For example, in EEOC v. Sears, 417 F.3d 789 (7th Cir. 2005), the court held that the interactive process is triggered even when \"notice is ambiguous as to the precise nature of the disability or desired accommodation.\" The court explained that \"it is sufficient to notify the employer that the employee may have a disability that requires accommodation.\" At that point, the employ er can ask for clarification, but \"cannot shield itself from liability by choosing no t to follow up on an employee's requests for assistance, or by intentionally remain ing in the dark.\" In this case, the court observed that the employee's notification to superv isors that she wanted to use a shorter route through a stockroom because the otherwise lon g walk was difficult for her was enough to put the employer on notice that she had l eg problems and needed permission to pursue the shortcut. See also Armstrong v. Burd ette Tomlin Memorial Hospital, 438 F.3d 240 (3d Cir. 2006)(although the employee must request an accommodation, the request need not be specific.) 58 See also 7/29/98 Informal Guidance letter form Chr istopher J. Kuczynski, Assistant Legal Counsel (\"In order to receive a reasonable accommod ation, an employee with a disability must request one from the employer. The employee should explain why a particular accommodation is needed.\") - 31 -Similarly in McGinnis v. Wonder Chemical Co ., 5 AD Cases 291 (E.D. Pa. 1995), the court rejected the employer's argument that the plaintiff was not qualified for his Truck Maintenance Supervisor job - requiring heavy lifting, bending, and twisting. In that case, the employee claimed that he could perfo rm the essential functions with reasonable accommodations. The court implicitly ag reed that the employer was on notice of the need for reasonable accommodation bec ause the employee told his supervisor that his pain prevented him from working . Interestingly, in this case, the court noted that the employer was also on notice of the employee's need for FMLA leave. Therefore, employers should carefully monit or FMLA leave requests to determine whether the individual also is requesting an ADA reasonable accommodation. The EEOC has stated that requests for accommodation need not be made in writing. Although the employer may ask the individual \"to fi ll out a form or submit the request in written form,\" the employer cannot ignor e an oral request. EEOC Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation an d Undue Hardship Under the ADA, No. 915.002 (10/17/02), at Question 3. The EE OC's internal procedures on reasonable accommodation require, however, that the employee to submit a written request confirming any oral request for accommodati on. See Internal EEOC \"Procedures for Providing Reasonable Accommodation for Individuals with Disabilities\" (2/2001) at III (\"employees seeking a reasonable accommodation must follow up an oral request either by completing the attached 'Confirmation of Request' form or otherwise confirming their request in writi ng (including by e-mail) to the Disability Program Manager.... While the written conf irmation should be made as soon as possible following the request, it is not a requirement for the request itself. EEOC will begin processing the request as soon as i t is made, whether or not the confirmation has been provided. \") (bold in original). The courts would likely agr ee with EEOC's position. For example, as noted earlie r, in Parkinson v. Anne Arundel Medical Center, 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 22442 (4 th Cir. 2003) (unpublished) the court noted that requests for accommodation need not necessaril y be in writing. In addition, at least one appellate court has ruled that an employee may be required to follow procedures set forth in a collec tive bargaining agreement when communicating the need for reasonable accommodation . See Lockard v. General Motors Corp., 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 25787 (6 th Cir. 2002) (unpublished)(employee did not properly request a reasonable accommodation because he did not use the procedures required by the collective bargaining agreement.) C. Employer's Duty to Engage in Interactive Proces s Once an accommodation has been requested, the emplo yer is obligated to initiate an interactive process with the individual. In Barnett v. U.S. Air, Inc., 228 F.3d 1105 (9 th Cir. 2000), vacated on other grounds. 535 U.S. 391, 122 S. Ct. 1516 (2002), the Supreme C ourt explained that the \"interactive - 32 -process\" requires the employer to \"analyze job func tions to establish the essential and nonessential job tasks,\" to \"identify the barri ers to job performance\" by consulting with the employee to learn \"the precise limitations\" and to learn \"the types of accommodations which would be most effecti ve. \" In Taylor v. Phoneixville School District, 184 F.3d 296 (3 rd Cir. 1999) the Third Circuit observed that the int eractive process \"as its name implies, requires the employer to take some initiative\" and that \"the interactive process would have little meaning if it was interpreted to allow the employer, in the face of a request for accommodatio n, simply to sit back passively, offer nothing, and then, in post-termination litigation, try to knock down every specific accommodation as too burdensome. That's not the pr oactive process intended: it does not help avoid litigation by bringing the parties t o a negotiated settlement.\" The Taylor court noted that employers can demonstrate good fai th during the interactive process by \"taking steps like the following: meet with the employee who requests the accommodation, request information about the condit ion and what limitations the employee has, ask the employee what he or she speci fically wants, show some sign of having considered employee's request, and offer to discuss available alternatives when the request is too burdensome.\" Still, the court concluded that an employer who act s in bad faith during the interactive process will be liable under the ADA on ly \"if the jury can reasonably conclude that the employee would have been able to perform the job with accommodations.\" See also Donahue v. Consolidated Rail Corporation, 224 F.3d 226 (3d Cir. 2000); Mengine v.Runyon, 114 F.3d 415 (3d Cir. 1997)(the court rules that there is no independent legal violation by failing to engage in the interactive process, but that \"if an employer fails to engage in the interactive process , it may not discover a way in which the employee's disability could have been reasonabl y accommodated, thereby risking violation\" of the law.) D. Investigating Disability When Reasonable Accommo dation is Requested If an employee requests a reasonable accommodation, the employer may ask him or her for information regarding the disability. In deed, the employer is entitled to know that the individual has a covered disability and that she or he requires an accommodation because of the disability . In its \"ADA Enforcement Guidance: Pre-Employment D isability-Related Questions and Medical Examinations\" (10/10/95), t he EEOC has stated that if the disabled employee requests a reasonable accommodati on in the context of disability and/or the need for accommodation that is not obvio us, the employer may ask for reasonable documentation describing the employee's disability and functional limitations. This Guidance is available on the internet at www.eeoc.gov . In its \"Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation a nd Undue Hardship, No. 915.002\" (10/17/02) at Question 6, the EEOC reiter ated that an employer cannot ask for unrelated information, \"in most situations, an empl oyer cannot request a person's complete medical records because they are likely to contain information unrelated to the disability at issue and the need for accommodation. \" - 33 - For example, in cases where a disability is not obv ious, an employer \"may ask the employee for documentation describing the impai rment; the nature, severity, and duration of the impairment; the activity or activit ies that the impairment limits and the extent to which the impairment limits the emplo yee's ability to perform the activity or activities.\" The EEOC has also stated that an individual \"can be asked to sign a limited release allowing the employer to submit a list of s pecific questions\" to the individual's \"health care or vocational professiona l .\" In addition, the EEOC has written that an employer may require t he individual to go to the health professional of the employer's choice if the individual provides insufficient information. \" In such a case, however, the EEOC has cautioned tha t the employer \"should explain why the documentation is insufficient,\" \"al low the individual to provide the missing information,\" and \"pay all costs associated with the visits(s)\" to the employer- chosen health professional. Guidance at p. 13-16. E. Employee's Failure to Cooperate in Providing Med ical Documentation and/or Identifying Reasonable Accommodation Failing to cooperate in the interactive process can be fatal to an individual's ADA claim for reasonable accommodation. Cooperation can include a number of things, such as being willing to try an accommodation, being willing to discuss alternative s, and providing needed documentation. The EEOC has stated that during the interactive process, the individual \"does not have to be able to specify the precise ac commodation\" needed, but \"does need to describe the problems posed by the workplace bar rier.\" In Whelan v. Teledyne Metal Working Products, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 6268 (3d Cir . 2007) (unpublished), the court held that the employee was responsible for the brea kdown in the interactive process that occurred by insisting upon a single accommodation t hat was \"unreasonable as a matter of law.\" In addition, it appears that an employer may requir e cooperation in determining whether an accommodation continues to be needed. F or example, in Conneen v. MBNA America Bank, N.A., 334 F.3d 318 (3d Cir. 2003), the employer had given the employee a temporarily modified schedule, allowing her to come to work one hour late because of morning sedation caused by her anti-depression medi cation. Some time later, a new supervisor requested that the employee return to he r regular schedule - the employee agreed that she could work the regular hours. When the employee continued to be late, the employee blamed her tardiness on heavy traffic, her parents, and her dog's \"gastric distress.\" After she was terminated, the employee claimed that the employer should have continued the modified schedule. The court dis agreed, however, noting that the employee never requested a continuation of her modi fied schedule, and that an - 34 -employer \"cannot be held liable for failing to read [the employee's] tea leaves.\" The court observed that the employee \"had an obligation to truthfully communicate any need for an accommodation, or to have her doctor do so on her behalf if she was too embarrassed to respond to MBNA's many inquires into any reason she may have had for continuing to be late.\" F. Employer's Right to Choose Accommodation An employer is obligated to provide an effective ac commodation - not necessarily the particular accommodation that the employee is seeking or desires . See Appendix to 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.9. Indeed, the EEOC has consistently stated that altho ugh an employer must give an \"effective\" accommodation, it need not be the \"b est\" accommodation. 59 Although it should give consideration to the employer's preferr ed accommodation, the employer is free to choose any effective accommodation that is less expensive or easier to provide . While the employee is free to refuse an accommodati on offered by the employer, See Appendix to 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.9(d), the employer has certainly met its ADA obligations by offering an effective accommodation even if the employee cho oses not to accept it. In addition, the EEOC and courts have e xplained that although an employee cannot be forced to accept a reasonable accommodati on, if she or cannot perform the job without the accommodation, he or she will not be co nsidered \"qualified\" under the ADA. 29 C.F.R. \u00a71630.9(d); EEOC Enforcement Guidan ce on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship, No. 915.002 (10/1 7/02) at Question 11. 60 G. Reasonable Accommodations for Temporary Workers In the case of temporary workers, several issues ar ise concerning reasonable accommodation. One common question is whether the temporary agency or the client company - the so-called \"borrowing employer\" - has the obligation to provide accommodations. According to the EEOC, during the application process, the staffing firm or the \"lending employer\" is the applicant's p rospective employer \"because it has not yet identified the client for which the applica nt will work.\" For that reason, the staffing firm has the obligation to provide accommo dations for the application process. EEOC Enforcement Guidance on the Application of the ADA to Contingent Workers Placed by Temporary Agencies and Other Staffing Fir ms (12/22/00), at C96). See Guidance on the internet at www.eeoc.gov . Once a worker has been referred to a client, both the lending employer and borrowing employer may be obligated to accommodate if both qualify as joint employers . 59 See May 15, 1995 Informal Guidance letter from Eli zabeth M. Thornton, Deputy Legal Counsel. 60 See March 10, 1994 Informal Guidance letter from P hilip B. Calkins, Acting Director of Communications and Legislative Affairs (\"[i]f an em ployee refuses an effective reasonable accommodation, but cannot perform a job's essential functions without it, s/he will no longer be considered qualified. - 35 -For workers' compensation liability purposes, the i dentity of the injured worker's \"employer\" is determined on the basis of \" indicia of control\" over the workers' job duties, meaning that depending upon the facts o f the particular case, the injured worker may be the employee of the lending employer or the employee of the borrowing employer - but not the employee of both entities. See JFC Temps, Inc. v. Workers' Compensation Appeal Board (Lindsay and G&B Packing) , 545 Pa. 149, 680 A.2d 862 (1996); Red Line Express Co., Inc., v.

Cmwlth. 588, 590, 418 A.2d 780, 781 (1980)(\"When an employee is furnished by one entity to another, the situation is one of 'borrowe d employee.' \") See Black v. Labor Ready, Inc. et. al., 995 A.2d 875 (Pa. Super. 2010) (borrowing employer estopped from asserting exclusive remedy defense in civil action brought by temporary employee who suffered amputation injury while working in borrowi ng employer's factory, following borrowing employer's denial of its alleged employer status during workers' compensation litigation). H. Permanent Light Duty The Eleventh Circuit recently issued an opinion hol ding that an employer was not required by the ADA to create a permanent light -duty position as a reasonable accommodation. Frazier-White v. Gee, No. 15-12119 ( 11 th Cir. 2016). The Court held that, to the extent Plaintiff intended to request a perma nent light-duty position, it is undisputed that no such position existed. The emplo yer's policy provided that every employee is essential to its efficient operation, a nd that eligibility for light-duty status is thus limited to 270 days during a two-year period. As such, the Court held that Defendant was not required by the ADA to create a p ermanent light-duty position especially for Plaintiff. The takeaway from the Ele venth Circuit's decision is that employers should not create permanent light-duty po sitions and make sure the light duty policy emphasizes the fact that the position t emporary. 8. THE LAW OF \"UNDUE HARDSHIP\" The ADA and the EEOC's regulations set forth a numb er of factors that are to be considered in determining whether an accommodation imposes an \"undue hardship\" on the employer: (a) The nature and net cost of the accommodation; (b) The financial resources of the facility/facili ties, the number of employees at the facility/facilities, the effect on expenses and resources, or other impact on the operation of the facility/facilities; (c) The overall financial resources of the entity, the size of the business with respect to the number of employees; the number, typ e, and location of its facilities; and - 36 -(d) The type of operations of the entity, includin g the composition, structure, and functions of the workforce, and the geographic separateness and administrative or fiscal relationship of the facility/facilities in q uestion to the covered entity. D. TITLE VII OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1964 As noted above, Title VII is a federal law that pro hibits employment discrimination on the basis of an individual's race , color, religion, sex, national origin in the context of: (1) hiring and firing; (2) compensa tion, assignment, or classification of employees; (3) transfer, promotion, layoff, or reca ll; (4) job advertisements; (5) recruitment; (6) testing; (7) use of company facili ties; (8) training and apprenticeship programs; (9) fringe benefits; (10) pay, retirement plans, and disability leave; or (11) other terms and conditions of employment. In addition, Title VII prohibits: (1) harassment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; (2) retaliation against an individual for filing a charge of discrimination, participating in an investigation, or opposing discriminatory practices; (3) employment decisions based on stereotypes or as sumptions about the abilities, traits, or performance of individuals of a certain sex, rac e, age, religion, or ethnic group, or individuals with disabilities, or based on myths or assumptions about an individual's genetic information; (4) denying employment opportu nities to a person because of marriage to, or association with, an individual of a particular race, religion, national origin, or an individual with a disability and (5) discrimination based upon participation in schools or places of worship associated with a p articular racial, ethnic, or religious group. The law not only prohibits intentional discriminati on, but also disparate treatment or practices that have the effect of disc riminating against individuals on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, or sex. The law applies to private employers, state and loc al governments, and educational institutions that employ fifteen or mor e individuals. It also applies to private and public employment agencies, labor organ izations, and joint labor management committees that control apprenticeship a nd training. 1. Race Related and Color Discrimination Discrimination on the basis of an immutable charact eristic associated with race, such as skin color, hair texture, or certain facial features is a violation of Title VII. This is true even though not all members of the race share the same characteristic. Title VII also prohibits discrimination on the basis of a conditio n which predominantly affects one race unless the discriminatory practice is job rela ted and consistent with business necessity. For example, since sickle cell anemia pr edominantly occurs in African- Americans, a policy that excludes individuals with sickle cell anemia is discriminatory unless the policy is job related and consistent wit h business necessity. Similarly, a \"no- beard\" employment policy may discriminate against A frican-American men who have a - 37 -predisposition to pseudofolliculitis barbae - sever e shaving bumps -unless the policy is job-related and consistent with business necessity. Even though race and color clearly overlap, they ar e not synonymous. Accordingly, color discrimination can occur between persons of different races or ethnicities, or between persons of the same race or ethnicity. Although Title VII does not specifically define \"color,\" the courts and the EEO C interpret \"color\" to have its commonly understood meaning - pigmentation, complex ion, or skin shade or tone. In other words, color discrimination occurs when a per son is discriminated against based on the lightness, darkness, or other color characte ristic of the person. Title VII prohibits race/color discrimination against all persons, incl uding Caucasians. Employers should adopt \"best practices\" to reduce t he likelihood of discrimination and to address impediments to equal employment opportunity. 2. National Origin Discrimination It is illegal under Title VII to discriminate again st an individual on the basis of birthplace, ancestry, culture, or linguistic charac teristics common to a specific ethnic group. Accordingly, a rule requiring that employees speak only English on the job may violate Title VII unless the employer can demonstra te that the requirement is necessary for conducting business. If the employer believes s uch a rule is necessary, employees must be informed when English is required and the c onsequences for violating the rule. The Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 19 86 requires employers to assure that employees hired are legally authorized to work in the United States. An employer who requests employment verification only for individuals of a particular national origin, or individuals who appear to be or sound foreign, may violate both Title VII and IRCA. Rather, verification must be obtained from all applicants and employees. Employers who impose citizenship requirements or gi ve preferences to U.S. citizens in hiring or employment opportunities may also violate IRCA. 3. Religious Discrimination Title VII protects all aspects of religious observa nce and practice as well as belief and defines religion very broadly for purposes of d etermining what the law covers. For purposes of Title VII, religion includes traditiona l, organized religions such as Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhis m, as well as religious beliefs that are new, uncommon, not part of a formal church or s ect, only subscribed to by a small number of people, or that seem illogical or unreaso nable to others. An employee's belief or practice can be \"religious\" under Title VII even if the employee is affiliated with a religious group that does not espouse or recognize that individual's belief or practice, or if few - or no - other people adhere to it. Title V II's protections also extend to those who are discriminated against (or those who require an accommodation) because they profess no religious beliefs. - 38 - Religious beliefs include theistic beliefs (i.e. th ose that include a belief in God) as well as non-theistic moral or ethical beliefs as to what is right and wrong which are sincerely held with the strength of traditional rel igious views. Although courts generally resolve doubts about particular beliefs in favor of finding that they are religious, beliefs are not protected merely because they are strongly held. Rather, religion typically concerns \"ultimate ideas\" about \"life, purpose, and death.\" Social, political, or economic philosophies, as well as mere personal preferences, are not \"religious\" beliefs protected by Title VII. Religious observances or practices include, for exa mple, attending worship services, praying, wearing religious garb or symbol s, displaying religious objects, adhering to certain dietary rules, proselytizing or other forms of religious expression, or refraining from certain activities. Whether a pract ice is religious depends on the employee's motivation. The same practice might be e ngaged in by one person for religious reasons and by another person for purely secular reasons ( e.g., dietary restrictions, tattoos, etc.). Discrimination based on religion within the meaning of Title VII could include, for example: not hiring an otherwise qualified appl icant because he is a self-described evangelical Christian; a Jewish supervisor denying a promotion to a qualified non- Jewish employee because the supervisor wishes to gi ve a preference based on religion to a fellow Jewish employee; or, terminating an employ ee because he told the employer that he recently converted to the Baha'i Faith. An employer is required to reasonably accommodate t he religious belief of an employee or prospective employee, unless doing so w ould impose an undue hardship. Requests for accommodation of a \"religious\" belief or practice could include, for example: a Catholic employee requesting a schedule change so that he can attend church services on Good Friday; a Muslim employee requesti ng an exception to the company's dress and grooming code allowing her to wear her he adscarf, or a Hindu employee requesting an exception allowing her to wear her bi ndi (religious forehead marking); an atheist asking to be excused from the religious inv ocation offered at the beginning of staff meetings; an adherent to Native American spir itual beliefs seeking unpaid leave to attend a ritual ceremony; or an employee who identi fies as Christian but is not affiliated with a particular sect or denomination requests acc ommodation of his religious belief that working on his Sabbath is prohibited. With all that being said, in a recent Pennsylvania Decision (Groff v. DeJoy), the court held that the employer did not violate Title VII by declining a religious accommodation for exemption from Sunday work becaus e it caused undue hardship. The Third Circuit furthered a current circuit split by holding that a religious accommodation is not reasonable under Title VII unl ess it entirely eliminates the conflict between religious practice and work requirements (3 5 F.4th 162.). 4. Sex Discrimination/Harassment - 39 -Title VII's broad prohibitions against sex discrimi nation specifically cover sexual harassment, including direct requests for sexual fa vors or workplace conditions that create a hostile environment for persons of either gender, including same sex harassment. The \"hostile environment\" standard also applies to harassment on the bases of race, color, national origin, and religion. Unc omfortable conduct in the workplace, like sexual advances, or gender-based baiting, ridi cule, banter or hazing can create a hostile work environment. There are two types of sexual harassment actionable under Title VII: quid pro quo and hostile work environment. \"Quid pro quo\" harassment occurs in the workplace w hen an employee's submission becomes a term or condition of their emp loyment, or when submission or reject is a basis for decisions affecting the emplo yee. For example, when a manager or other authority figure offers or merely hints that he or she will give the employee something (a raise or a promotion) in return for th at employee's satisfaction of a sexual demand. This also occurs when a manager or other au thority figure says he or she will not fire or reprimand an employee in exchange for s ome type of sexual favor. A job applicant also may be the subject of this kind of h arassment if the hiring decision was based on the acceptance or rejection of sexual adva nces. For harassment to be actionable under Title VII the offensive conduct must be sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create a hostile working environment. This standard requires that the environment be both objectively and subjectively offensive. Id. The severe or pervasive requirement is strictly interpreted and many times courts will \"fi lter out complaints attacking the ordinary tribulations of the workplace, such as the sporadic use of abusive language, gender related jokes, and occasional teasing\" refer red to as \"stray remarks.\" Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 788 (1998). In addition, a reasonable person must find the work environment hostile or abusive, and the victim must actually perceive it t o be so. Most often this is a subjective analysis supported by objective facts. In deciding what constitutes a hostile work environment, the courts generally consider \"the tot ality of the circumstances\" approach looking at the frequency or regularity of the discr iminatory conduct, the severity of the conduct, whether the conduct was physical at all or physically threatening and finally, whether the conduct unreasonably interfered with an employee's work performance. In limited circumstances, the presence of a single one time act can be sufficient to establish a claim of hostile work environment harassment - an example of this would be a workplace rape or sexual assault. The EEOC has issued guidance stating that in determ ining whether harassment is sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hos tile environment, the harasser's conduct should be evaluated from the objective standpoint o f a \"reasonable person.\" Title VII does not serve \"as a vehicle for vindicating the pe tty slights suffered by the hypersensitive.\" Zabkowicz v. West Bend Co ., 589 F. Supp. 780, 784 (E.D. Wis. 1984). See also Ross v. Comsat, 759 F.2d 355 (4 th Cir. 1985). Thus, if the challenged conduct would - 40 -not substantially affect the work environment of a reasonable person, no violation should be found. As the Court noted in Vinson, 682 F.2d 897, 902 (11 th Cir. 1982), a mere utterance of an ethnic or racial epithet which enge nders offensive feelings in an employee may not affect the conditions of employmen t to a sufficiently significant degree to violate Title VII. 106 S.Ct. at 2406 (quo ting Rogers v. EEOC, 454 F.2d 234 (5th Cir. 1971), cert. denied , 406 U.S. 957, (1972)). A \"hostile environment\" claim generally requires a showing of a pattern of offensive conduct. In contrast, in \"quid pro quo\" c ases a single sexual advance may constitute harassment if it is linked to the granti ng or denial of employment benefits. Claims of \"hostile environment\" sexual harassment o ften are coupled with claims of constructive discharge. If constructive discharge d ue to a hostile environment is proven, the claim will also become one of \"quid pro quo\" ha rassment. It is the position of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a major ity of courts that an employer is liable for constructive discharge when it impose s intolerable working conditions in violation of Title VII when those conditions forese eably would compel a reasonable employee to quit, whether or not the employer speci fically intended to force the victim's resignation. In order to prove a disparate treatment claim under Title VII, an employee must establish that he or she suffered some unfair treat ment and that the reason for the unfair treatment was the employee's protected class. A more recent and prevalent topic includes LGBT-rel ated sex discrimination. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission interprets Title VII's prohibition of sex discrimination to also include gender identity and sexual orientation. 61 As the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission notes, \"[w]hile T itle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not explicitly include sexual orientat ion or gender identity in its list of protected bases, the Commission, consistent with Su preme Court case law holding that employment actions motivated by gender stereotyping are unlawful sex discrimination and other court decisions, interprets the statute's sex discrimination provision as prohibiting discrimination against employees on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.\"62 The EEOC lists the following as examples of LGBT-re lated claims it views as sex discrimination: Failing to hire an applicant because she is a trans gender woman; Firing an employee because he is planning or has ma de a gender transition; Denying an employee equal access to a common restro om corresponding to the employee's gender identity; 61 \"What You Should Know About EEOC and the Enforceme nt Protecions for LGBT Workers,\" U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (April 23, 2017), https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/wysk/enforcement _protections_lgbt_workers.cfm . 62 Id. - 41 - Harassing an employee because of a gender transitio n, such as by intentionally and persistently failing to use the n ame and gender pronoun that correspond to the gender identity with which t he employee identifies, and which the employee has communicated to management and employees; Denying an employee a promotion because he is gay o r straight; Discriminating in terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, such as providing a lower salary to an employee because of sexual orientation, or denying spousal health insurance benefits to a fema le employee because her legal spouse is a woman, while providing spousa l health insurance to a male employee whose legal spouse is a woman; Harassing an employee because of his or her sexual orientation, for example, by derogatory terms, sexually oriented com ments, or disparaging remarks for associating with a person o f the same or opposite sex; and Discriminating against or harassing an employee bec ause of his or her sexual orientation or gender identity, in combinati on with another unlawful reason, for example, on the basis of trans gender status and race, or sexual orientation and disability. 63 E. ENFORCING TITLE VII The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\" ) is the federal law enforcement agency charged with investigating compl aints of discrimination that violate anti-discrimination laws such as Title VII and the ADA. If an individual believes he has been subject to discrimination, he can file a compl aint (commonly called a \"charge\") with the EEOC. In Pennsylvania, in order to preserve a state law c ause of action, the employee must file with the Pennsylvania Human Relations Com mission (\"PHRC\") as well. The information below was largely taken from the EE OC website at www.eeoc.gov and describes the general procedures for filing a c harge of discrimination. Federal employees or applicants for employment should see t he fact sheet about Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity Complaint Processing o n the EEOC website at http://www.eeoc.gov/federal/fed_employees/complaint _overview.cfm . A. Who Can File a Charge of Discrimination? Any individual who believes that his or her employm ent rights have been violated may file a charge of discrimination with t he EEOC and/or the PHRC. In addition, an individual, organization, or agency may file a charge on behalf of another person in order to protect the aggrieved pe rson's identity. B. How Is a Charge of Discrimination Filed? 63 Id. - 42 - A charge may be filed by mail or in person at the n earest EEOC office. Individuals may consult their local telephone direc tory (U.S. Government listing) or call 1-800-669-4000 (voice) or 1-800-669-6820 (T TY) to contact the nearest EEOC office for more information on specific proced ures for filing a charge. Individuals who need an accommodation in order to f ile a charge (e.g., sign language interpreter, print materials in an accessi ble format) should inform the EEOC field office so appropriate arrangements can b e made. C. What Information Must Be Provided to File a Charge? The complaining party's name, address, and telephon e number; The name, address, and telephone number of the resp ondent employer, employment agency, or union that is alleged to have discriminated, and number of employees (or union members), if known; A short description of the alleged violation (the e vent that caused the complaining party to believe that his or her rights were violated); and The date(s) of the alleged violation(s). D. What Are the Time Limits for Filing a Charge of Dis crimination? All laws enforced by EEOC, except the Equal Pay Act , require filing a charge with EEOC before a private lawsuit may be filed in court . There are strict time limits within which charges must be filed: A charge must be filed with EEOC within 180 days fr om the date of the alleged violation, in order to protect the charging party's rights. The 180 day timeframe is also mandated by the Pennsylvania Human Relations A ct. (\"PHRA\") This 180-day filing deadline is extended to 300 day s if the charge also is covered by a state or local anti-discrimination law. To protect legal rights, it is always best to conta ct EEOC promptly when discrimination is suspected. E. What Happens after a Charge is Filed with EEOC? Once the employer is notified that the charge has b een filed, there are a number of ways a charge may be handled: A charge may be assigned for priority investigation if the initial facts appear to support a violation of law. When the evidence is le ss strong, the charge may be assigned for follow up investigation to determine w hether it is likely that a violation has occurred. EEOC can seek to settle a charge at any stage of th e investigation if the charging party and the employer express an interest in doing so. If settlement efforts are not successful, the investigation will continue. In investigating a charge, EEOC may make written re quests for information, interview people, review documents, and, as needed, visit the facility where the - 43 -alleged discrimination occurred. When the investiga tion is complete, EEOC will discuss the evidence with the charging party or emp loyer, as appropriate. It is important to note that in Canada v. Samuel Gr ossi & Sons, Inc., the Third Circuit held that an employer's motivation for inve stigating an employee can be relevant to pretext in a Title VII discrimination c ase. The employee plaintiff defeated summary judgment by showing that the emplo yer's purported reasons for searching his cell phone were weak, implausible , contradictory, incoherent, and more likely motivated by retaliation. The emplo yer could not provide any legitimate basis for searching the employee's locke r, let alone the cellphone inside the locker. (49 F.4th 340.) The charge may be selected for EEOC's mediation pro gram if both the charging party and the employer express an interest in this option. Mediation is offered as an alternative to a lengthy investigation. Particip ation in the mediation program is confidential, voluntary, and requires consent fr om both charging party and employer. If mediation is unsuccessful, the charge is returned for investigation. A charge may be dismissed at any point if, in the a gency's best judgment, further investigation will not establish a violation of the law. A charge may be dismissed at the time it is filed, if an initial in-depth int erview does not produce evidence to support the claim. When a charge is dismissed, a no tice is issued in accordance with the law which gives the charging party ninety days in which to file a lawsuit on his or her own behalf. F. How Does EEOC Resolve Discrimination Charges? If the evidence obtained in an investigation does n ot establish that discrimination occurred, this will be explained to the charging pa rty. A required notice is then issued, closing the case and giving the charging pa rty ninety days in which to file a lawsuit on his or her own behalf. If the evidence establishes that discrimination has occurred, the employer and the charging party will be informed of this in a letter of determination that explains the finding. EEOC will then attempt conciliation with t he employer to develop a remedy for the discrimination. If the case is successfully conciliated, or if a ca se has earlier been successfully mediated or settled, neither EEOC nor the charging party may go to court unless the conciliation, mediation, or settlement agreement is not honored. If EEOC is unable to successfully conciliate the ca se, the agency will decide whether to bring suit in federal court. If the EEOC decides not to sue, it will issue a notice closing the case and giving the charging party nine ty days in which to file a lawsuit on his or her own behalf. In Title VII and ADA case s against state or local governments, the Department of Justice takes these actions. G. When Can an Individual File an Employment Discrimin ation Lawsuit in Court? A charging party may file a lawsuit within ninety d ays of receipt of a \"right to sue\" notice from the EEOC, as stated above. - 44 -Under Title VII, and the ADA, a charging party also can request a notice of \"right to sue\" from EEOC 180 days after the charge was fir st filed with the Commission, and may then bring suit within 90 days after receiving the notice. H. What Remedies Are Available When Discrimination Is Found? The \"relief\" or remedies available for employment d iscrimination, whether caused by intentional acts or by practices that hav e a discriminatory effect, may include: (1) back pay; (2) hiring; (3) promotion; (4) reinst atement; (5) front pay; (6) reasonable accommodation, or (7) other actions that will make an individual \"whole\" (in the condition s/he would have been but for the discrimi nation). Remedies also may include payment of: (1) attorneys ' fees; (2) expert witness fees, and (3) court costs. Title VII provides a cap on damages according to th e number of employees as follows: TABLE 1: LIMITS ON DAMAGES Number of Employees in Company Maximum Sum of Compensatory and Punitive Damages 15-100 $ 50,000 101-200 $ 100,000 201-500 $ 200,000 501 or more $ 300,000 Under most EEOC-enforced laws, compensatory and pun itive damages also may be available where intentional discrimination is fo und. Damages may be available to compensate for actual monetary losses, for future m onetary losses, and for mental anguish and inconvenience. Punitive damages also ma y be available if an employer acted with malice or reckless indifference. Punitiv e damages are not available against the federal, state or local governments. In cases concerning reasonable accommodation under the ADA, compensatory or punitive damages may not be awarded to the charg ing party if an employer can demonstrate that \"good faith\" efforts were made to provide reasonable accommodation. An employer may be required to post notices to all employees addressing the violations of a specific charge and advising them o f their rights under the laws EEOC enforces and their right to be free from retaliatio n. Such notices must be accessible, as needed, to persons with visual or other disabilitie s that affect reading. - 45 -The employer also may be required to take correctiv e or preventive actions to cure the source of the identified discrimination an d minimize the chance of its recurrence, as well as discontinue the specific dis criminatory practices involved in the case. I. Employer Remedial Action Since Title VII \"affords employees the right to wor k in an environment free from discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult\" an employer is liable for failing to remedy known hostile or offensive work environments . See, e.g., Garziano v. E.I. Dupont de Nemours & Co., 818 F.2d 380, 388 (5 th Cir. 1987) (Vinson holds employers have an \"affirmative duty to eradicate 'hostile or offensiv e' work environments\"); Bundy v. Jackson, 641 F.2d 934, 947 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (employ er violated Title VII by failing to investigate and correct sexual harassment despite n otice); Tompkins v. Public Service Electric & Gas Co., 568 F.2d 1044, 1049 (3d Cir. 19 City of Dundee, 682 F.2d 897, 905 (11 th Cir. 1982) (same); Munford v. James T. Barnes & Co ., 441 F. Supp. 459 (E.D. Mich. 1977) (employer has an affirmative duty to investigate complaints of sexual harassment and to deal appropriately with th e offending personnel; \"failure to investigate gives tactic support to the discriminat ion because the absence of sanctions encourages abusive behavior\"). When an employer receives a complaint or otherwise learns of alleged sexual harassment in the workplace, the employer should in vestigate promptly and thoroughly. The employer should take immediate and appropriate corrective action by doing whatever is necessary to end the harassment, make the victim whole by restoring lost employment benefits or opportunities, and prev ent the misconduct from recurring. Disciplinary action against the offending superviso r or employee, ranging from reprimand to discharge, may be necessary. Generally , the corrective action should reflect the severity of the conduct. See Waltman v. International Paper Co ., 875 F.2d at 479 (appropriateness of remedial action will depend on the severity and persistence of the harassment and the effectiveness of any initial rem edial steps). Dornhecker v. Malibu Grand Prix Corp., 828 F.2d 307, 309-10 (5 th Cir. 1987) (the employer's remedy may be \"assessed proportionately to the seriousness of the offense\"). The employer should make follow-up inquiries to ensure the harassment has no t resumed and the victim has not suffered retaliation. If an employer acts promptly to investigate the har assment, once notified, and also takes appropriate disciplinary action under th e circumstances, it may be relieved from liability under Title VII . When an employer asserts it has taken remedial ac tion, the Commission will investigate to determine whethe r the action was appropriate and, more important, effective. The EEOC investigator sh ould conduct an independent investigation of the harassment claim, and the Comm ission will reach its own conclusion as to whether the law has been violated. If the Commission finds that the harassment has been eliminated, all victims made wh ole, and preventive measures instituted, it will normally administratively close the charge because of the employer's prompt remedial action. - 46 -In Barrett v. Omaha National Bank, 726 F.2d 424 (8 th Cir. 1984), the victim informed her employer that her co-worker had talked to her about sexual activities and touched her in an offensive manner. Within four day s of receiving this information, the employer investigated the charges, reprimanded the guilty employee placed him on probation, and warned him that further misconduct w ould result in discharge. A second co-worker who had witnessed the harassment was also reprimanded for not intervening on the victim's behalf or reporting the conduct. Th e court ruled that the employer's response constituted immediate and appropriate corr ective action, and on this basis found the employer not liable. In Yates v. Avco Corp., 819 F.2d 630 (6 th Cir. 1987), the court found the employer's policy against sexual harassment failed to function effectively. The victim's first-level supervisor had responsibility for repor ting and correcting harassment at the company, yet he was the harasser. The employer told the victims not to go to the EEOC. While giving the accused harasser administrative le ave pending investigation, the employer made the plaintiffs take sick leave, which was never credited back to them and was recorded in their personnel files as excessive absenteeism without indicating they were absent because of sexual harassment. 64 In addition to the above, in Uronis v. Cabot Oil & Gas Corp, the Third Circuit decided an important question under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). The anti- retaliation provision of the FLSA prohibits discrim ination against employees who have engaged in protected activity. Under Section 15(a)( 3) of the FLSA, protected activity includes having \"testified\" or being \"about to test ify\" in any FLSA-related proceeding. The court concluded that requiring an employee to b e literally scheduled to testify or already subpoenaed to testify in order to be afford ed protection under Section 15(a)(3) would be inconsistent with the statue's broad prote ctive purpose to. Rather, the court held that an employee effectively \"testifies\" under Section 15(a)(3) when the employee files a consent to join an FLSA collective action. Employers should be mindful of this ruling when making hiring decisions involving appli cants who have opted into an FLSA collective or are known to be planning to do so, an d when evaluating potential adverse action against current employees in the same positi on. (49 F.4th 263.) E. COBRA - CONSOLIDATED OMNIBUS BUDGET RECONCILIATION ACT OF 1986 The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, commonly referred to as \"COBRA\" was enacted through amendmen ts to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act 65 and was signed into law by President Reagan on Apri l 7, 1986. As noted above, the statute guarantees the covered employee and the employee's family members the right to continued coverage thro ugh the employer's group health 64 The authors acknowledge www.eeoc.gov which was utilized as a reference for selected portions of the text. 65 For more information regarding COBRA visit the U.S . Department of Labor's website at www.dol.gov/ebsa/faqs_consumer_cobra - 47 -plan, at the employee's expense, where coverage wou ld otherwise be lost due to certain \"qualifying events,\" e.g. the employee who voluntar ily resigns his or her employment or is terminated by his or her employer for any reason other than \"gross misconduct.\" The statute permits the employee's spouse or childr en to maintain the group coverage they enjoy regardless of the employee's CO BRA election decision, assuming, of course, that the spouse or children were insured un der the employer's group plan the day before the \"qualifying event.\" If an employee f orgoes COBRA, any of his qualified family members may elect to continue their health i nsurance benefits under the former employer's plan for up to thirty-six months. Originally, Title X of the legislation amended the Internal Revenue Code and Public Health Service Act to deny income tax deduct ions to employers for contributions to group health plans where the employer failed to meet continuing coverage requirements. The statute now imposes an excise tax on those employers whose health plan fails to provide continuing coverage to qualif ied employees. Because the employee - not the employer - must bear the cost of the benefit, COBRA rights are rarely invoked .66 1. Plan Coverage A worker is eligible for COBRA health insurance cov erage where he or she is employed by the following qualified employers: (a) a private sector entity that employs twenty or more employees on more than fifty percent of its typical business days during the previous calendar year enrolled in a group plan ; (b) a state or local government; (c) an entity that classifies him or her as an independ ent contractor, or (d) a non-profit organization with twenty or more employees enrolled in a group health plan. The law grants an exemption from COBRA continuation rules for workers employed by the federal government, certain church- related organizations and private firms employing fewer than twenty individuals. 66 In 2006 for example only 10% of those eligible to i nvoke COBRA coverage actually did so . That is because COBRA participation typically comes at a high price. If the employee chooses to continue his or her group health plan under COBRA, he or she can be charged one hundred percent of the premium plus a two percent administr ative fee. According to the nonprofit group Families USA, group health coverage for COBRA parti cipants consumes 84% of the average monthly unemployment compensation benefit, renderin g participation impossible in many instances. The American Recovery and Reinvestment A ct of 2009 provides qualified COBRA participants with a 65% federal subsidy covering gr oup health insurance premiums for up to fifteen months. An employee can take advantage of this legislation provided he or she becomes eligible for COBRA from September 1, 2008 through J une 2, 2010 and provided the employee was involuntarily terminated or experienced a reduction in work hours that led to loss of health insurance benefits. An employee will not be eligibl e for assistance if his annual income is above $125,000.00 (single) or $250,000.00 (joint tax retu rn). Subsidies are reduced for those with modified adjusted gross incomes of up to $145,000.0 0 (single) or $290,000.00 (joint tax return). - 48 -2. Qualified Beneficiaries A \"qualified beneficiary\" is an individual who was covered by a group health plan on the day before a \"qualifying event\" occurre d that caused him or her to lose coverage. If the employee's employer has more than twenty emp loyees, but does not offer group health coverage, or offers coverage only to c ertain groups of employees and the employee is not a member of one of those groups, th e employee is not a qualified beneficiary and will not be eligible for COBRA cove rage. In addition, if the employee's employer goes out of business , thereby ending the group health plan, the employees will not be a qual ified beneficiary eligible for COBRA coverage since there is no health plan to \"continue \" in that instance. The employee will no longer be eligible for COBRA c overage ends where: (a) he or she exhausts his or her eighteen or twenty-six m onth COBRA coverage period; (b) he or she does not pay his or her premium; (c) his or her employer chooses to discontinue its group plan; (d) the employer goes out of busine ss; or (e) the employee obtains coverage through another employer group health plan that does not contain any exclusion or limitation regarding pre-existing cond itions. 3. Qualifying Events The key feature of COBRA is the requirement that th e employer's group health insurance plan allows the employee and the employee 's immediate family members who had been covered by the health care plan, to ma intain coverage where it would otherwise be lost due to certain \"qualifying events .\" A \"qualifying event\" is an event that causes an ind ividual to lose his or her group health coverage. The statute references the following \"qualifying ev ents\": (a) the death of the covered employee; (b) termination of the covered em ployee for any reason other than \"gross misconduct,\" including resignation, lay-off, strike, lockout, medical leave;(c) reduction in hours worked by the covered employee; (d) the covered employee becomes entitled to Medicare; (e) divorce or legal separati on of the spouse from the covered employee that terminates the ex-spouse's eligibilit y for benefits or (f) loss of dependent child status under the plan rules. . The particular \"qualifying event\" will yield variou s forms of continuing coverage: COBRA COVERAGE - 49 -QUALIFYING EVENT ELIGIBLE BENEFICIARIES MAXIMUM COVERAGE TIME Voluntary Termination Employee Spouse Dependent Child 18 months Involuntary Termination Employee Spouse Dependent Child 18 months Reduced Hours Employee Spouse Dependent Child 18 months Total Disability Employee 29 months Employee Entitled To Medicare Spouse Dependent Child 36 months Divorce Or Legal Separation from Employee Spouse Dependent Child 36 months Death Of Employee Spouse Dependent Child 36 months Loss Of Dependent-Child Status Dependent Child 36 months 4. Eligible Health Plans Health plans subject to COBRA include the following : (a) medical plans; (b) dental, vision and prescription drug plans; (c) dru g and alcohol treatment programs; (d) fully insured and self-insured group health plans, including HMOs; (e) Employee Assistance Plans, (\"EAP\") that provide medical care such as counseling or psychological treatment; (f) on-site health care, including disco unted or free medical services; (g) Section 125 flexible spending accounts, also known as cafeteria plans, under certain circumstances. The following programs not subject to COBRA: (a) wellness programs; (b) some church plans; (c) federal government health plans; (d) disability-income policies; (e) Accidental Death and Dismemberment policies; (e) li fe, disability and long-term care insurance plans, and medical savings accounts (MSAs ); and (f) Employee Assistant Plans that do not provide medical care. 5. Health Plan Selection - 50 - Employers may, but are not required to, grant the separated employee the option of dropping benefits such as dental and vision care while receiving COBRA coverage. If the employer offers separate health insurance pl ans such as dental, medical and vision, the separated employee and his or her q ualified family members may choose to continue any combination under COBRA. If, howev er, multiple health benefits are offered through one plan, the separated employee mu st elect the entire plan or forego the coverage in its entirety. If the employer changes its health insurance plan f or its current employees, the separated employee is entitled to purchase coverage under the new plan. If the employer switches plans, the separated emp loyee will not be permitted to maintain the old plan, but will be forced to move t o the new plan along with the rest of the group. 6 . Electing COBRA Coverage The COBRA rights provided under the plan must be described in the plan's summary plan description (\"SPD\") - a written docume nt that describes the benefits of the plan, the rights of the participants and benefi ciaries under the plan and how the plan works. Before a group health plan must offer a continuatio n of coverage, it must be notified of the qualifying event. The employer, must within thirty days , notify the plan if the qualifying event is: (a) termination or reduction of hours in the employ ment of the covered employee; (b) death of the covered employee; (c) covered employee becomes entitled to Medicare or (d) bankruptcy of employer. The employee or one of the covered employee's quali fied beneficiaries must, within sixty days , notify the plan if the qualifying event is: (a) a divorce; (b) legal separation; or (c) a child's loss of dependent stat us under the plan. . When the plan receives notice of a qualifying event , the plan must, within fourteen days, give the qualified beneficiaries an \"election notice \" describing their rights to continuation coverage and how to make an election. The qualified beneficiary thereafter has sixty days to decide whether to elect COBRA continuation coverage and forty-five days after electing coverage to pay the initial premium. 7. Effective Dates of Coverage - 51 - The separated employee's COBRA coverage will be effective on a retroactive basis to the date the employee lost his benefits, provided he or she has paid his or her premium. If the employee enrolls in COBRA on the last day he or she is eligible to do so, the coverage period will commence retroactively to the date he or she lost his or her benefits, provided he or she has paid his or her pr emium. If the employee elects to purchase COBRA coverage , he or she may cancel coverage at any time. 8. Interaction with Workers' Compensation Claim \"Qualifying events\" occur quite often in the cont ext of a workers' compensation claim. If the employee becomes totally disabled as a conse quence of a work injury, he or she may, pursuant to a collective bargaining agreem ent, or in accordance with employer work rules, lose his or her group plan benefit afte r a period of time, thereby triggering the employee's COBRA rights. Where, however, the employer administers the work-r elated disability under FMLA - by counting the absences against the employe e's entitlement to unpaid leave - the leave will not be construed as a \"qualifying event\" but will entitle the employee to continued health coverage in the absence of a CO BRA election. A COBRA qualifying event may occur, however, where the employer's obligation to maintain health benefits under FMLA c eases, e.g. the employee notifies the employer of his or her intent not to return to work following the exhaustion of FMLA leave, or, where the leave continues in the fo rm of an ADA reasonable accommodation. It is well-understood that workers' compensation cl aims are often prompted by an involuntary separation. For example, the employee may file a new workers' c ompensation claim or re- institute an old claim - preserving medical coverag e for the work-related condition or assuring continuation of weekly wage loss benefits - following an economic lay-off from a light-duty position, or a disciplinary discharge. Employment separation, in the form of a voluntary r esignation, may occur in conjunction with a Compromise and Release settlemen t - where the employer or insurance company insists upon such a condition of settlement. In each instance the separated employee will be eli gible for COBRA coverage provided there is a qualified group plan offered by the employer and provided that the separation was not prompted by the employee's \"gros s misconduct.\" - 52 - The availability of COBRA coverage in such instance s will not significantly impact the employer though such qualifying events w ill require the employer to issue a COBRA notification. So, it is important that the employer's workers' co mpensation claims office communicate with the employer's benefits office in order to make certain that when a qualifying event occurs in the context of a workers ' compensation claim or settlement the proper COBRA notification is circulated. VI. PRIVACY ISSUES Privacy issues in the workplace can become a signif icant issue in both workers' compensation claims and other related employment ma tters. Understanding the rights of the employee and limitations of their right of p rivacy can play a significant role in the litigation that can ensue regarding said claims. Th ere are a variety of federal and state laws and regulations which come into play in these situations. A number of the more important statutes will be addressed herein. A. MEDICAL ISSUES Paramount in the workers' compensation setting are the concerns regarding the use and dissemination of medical information acquir ed by the employer or its' agents. Certainly, for an employee, the use and misuse of m edical information is often a significant concern in situations that require the disclosure of their personal medical information. Towards that end, the employer should be aware of the following. The Americans with Disabilities Act Amendment Act o f 1990 (ADAAA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a712101 et seq., has within it provisions tha t address the privacy rights of the employees and their medical records. Under the ADAA A, medical records are to be kept in a private manner, meaning that they are to be ke pt in a separate medical file and treated as a confidential medical record. [29 CFR \u00a7 1630.14(b)(1)]. Any medical information must be collected on a separate medical form, and again kept in a separate medical file, which is to be confidential with cert ain exceptions. One of those exceptions being that supervisors or managers may be informed regarding an employee's restrictions and certain accommodations that may ne ed to be made for their position. A second exception being that certain information may be provided to first aid or safety personnel for specialized or emergency medical trea tment that may be required in the workplace. To be clear, any preemployment examinati ons or subsequent return to work examinations, should likewise be kept confidential in the appropriate separate medical file of the employee. [42 U.S.C. \u00a712112(d)(3)]. In a similar vein, the Genetic Information Nondiscr imination Act of 2008 (GINA), protects an individual's genetic information, healt h care, and insurance in employment situations. GINA makes it unlawful for an employer to request or require genetic information with respect to an employee or their fa mily. Further, in the event the information is acquired by the employer, employers are prohibited from disclosing the - 53 -genetic information in all but certain limited circ umstances. (42 U.S. Code Chapter 21F). Genetic information is defined as (i) An individual 's genetic tests; (ii) The genetic tests of the individuals family members; (iii) The manifesta tion of disease or disorder in family members of the individual; (iv) An individual's req uest for or receipt of genetic services; and (v) Genetic information of a fetus carried by a n individual or by a pregnant women who is a family member of the individual .... (29 C.F .R. \u00a71635.3). An example of this type of information might be a record reflecting a family history of a schizophrenic disorder. The Family Medical Leave Act, likewise has a requir ement that any medical information acquired in pursuance of a certificatio n of disability be kept in a separate confidential file. It further provides that to get clarification of disability, the employer cannot have the employee's direct supervisor reques t the information, and that the HIPAA Privacy Rule, 45 C.F.R. 160 and 164, must be satisfied. [29 C.F.R. 825.307(a)]. Finally, the Health Insurance Portability and Accou ntability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). While it may not be directly applicable to workers' compensation insurers and employers, it certainly can impact the ability of t hese entities to acquire medical information from health care providers and health c are plans who are covered by said regulations. B. COMMUNICATIONS ISSUES The next broad category of privacy issues that aff ect employees is the subject of communications. In this day in age, there has been a significant expansion in the number of types of communications that can occur, through telephone conversations, emails, text messages, and social media. Many of these have the potential of affecting litigation involving workers' compensation as well as various employment matters. The following is a brief summary of the statutes and their potent ial effect on these communications. The Pennsylvania Wiretapping and Electronic Survei llance Control Act, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. \u00a75701 et seq., is a law that prohi bits the recording, interception or disclosure of any wire, electronic, or oral communi cation without the consent of all participants. The related Federal Statutes are the Wiretap Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a72511, and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA ), 18 U.S.C. \u00a72510 et seq. It is important to note that in Pennsylvania, in order to record or otherwise intercept and listen to phone communications, it must be known to all parties that said recording is occurring. Without the acknowledged notification of all parties, any party illegally recording or intercepting telephone communications is potentially subject to a criminal penalty. \"A person is guilty of a felony of the thi rd degree if he intentionally intercepts, endeavors to intercept, or procures any other perso n to intercept or endeavor to intercept any wire, electronic or oral communicatio n.\" 18 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a75703(1), see also, Commonwealth v. Saccol, 557 A.2d 1095 (Pa. 1989). Company policy can play a significant role in certa in circumstances. If there is an understanding that the employer monitors all phone calls for quality control, there may be an argument that the employees are on notice tha t their calls are being recorded. - 54 -However, there may be a recognized difference in th e Courts between a business call and a personal call. Carmie Watkins v. L.m. Berry & Company, et al., 704 F.2d 577, 583 (11 th Cir. 1983). The stated policy of the employer shou ld be made very clear what telephone calls will be monitored. For example, whe ther it is simply business calls or all phone calls to the employees' telephone lines. Poss ibly adding to that policy that no personal calls are to be taken on business lines. Next is the issue regarding transmission of communi cations using electronic devices or systems provided by the employer. It is fairly clear that employers are entitled to monitor and acquire any emails, instant messaging or text messaging done using the employer's email system, instant messagin g, server, as well as any mobile devices provided by that employer. Again, employer' s policy should be clear that such items are being monitored and are not for personal use by employees. Smyth v. Pillsbury Co., 914 F Sup. 97 (E.D. Pa. 1996). In Pennsylvania it is illegal to require an employe e to take a polygraph test or any form of lie detector test as a condition of emp loyment. Title 18 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a77321. Violating this statute is a misdemeanor in the seco nd degree. A Pennsylvania Breach of Personal Information Notif ication Act 73 Pa. Con. Stat. Ann. \u00a72301, provides that when an employer discover s an individual's personal information has been breached, they are required to give notice to that individual that unauthorized personnel may have accessed their pers onal information. C. WORKPLACE SEARCHES For a number of reasons, workplace searches are re cognized as necessary by employers where an individual does not have a reaso nable expectation of privacy. The decisions on these issues have tended to focus on w here a reasonable expectation of privacy exists. Locker searchers are permitted wher e there is not a reasonable expectation of privacy, where the employer has prov ided the locker and the lock, or when the locker is not in fact locked. K-Mart Corp. v. Trotti, 677 S.W.2d 632 (1984). It is suggested the best practice in these situations is to minimize invasion of privacy claims by adopting a policy that allows employees to know that they do not have an expectation of privacy in a locker, office space, d esk or other similar spaces provided by the employer. One interesting case to note in Penns ylvania is a situation where there was recognition that an employer was not authorized to open mail addressed to an employee at his or her workplace that appears to be personal. Doe v. Kohn Nast & Graf, PC, 866 F. Supp. 190 (E.D. Pa.1994). It is suggeste d that even if the employer opens the mail based on a reasonable belief that the mail inv olved company business, that the employer may not retain copies of the mail once det ermined the mail is personal. Video surveillance in the workplace is generally co nsidered legal, subject to certain exceptions regarding expectations of privac y. Location can be an issue, in that there obviously should not be video cameras in the bathroom, locker room or private office where individuals have a certain expectation of privacy. One should also be aware of the prohibition against audio recordings of a pe rson as previously addressed under - 55 -the Pennsylvania Wiretapping and Electronic Surveil lance Control Act, as recording audio with the video could constitute as a violatio n of that statute. Audenreid v. Circuit City Stores, Inc., 97 F. Supp. 2d 660 (E.D. Pa. 200 0). VII. CONCLUSION While the language of statutes and the case law con struing statutes, or any accompanying regulation, must always be applied jud iciously, the human resource manager should always be mindful that application o f the law will rarely afford a good result in the absence of common sense and compassio n for the employee.
