They are characterized by creative bursts of energy, immense curiosity about the self and the world, sudden changes in the physical, emotional and social dimensions and expanded need for communication. They are also periods of grappling with an identity crisis, feelings of isolation, anxiety, alienation and confusion. Each individual is unique with inherent positive attributes and latent potential and it is the responsibility of the school to provide opportunities for young talent to blossom and flourish. The biggest killer in the world today is not war, disease or natural calamity. It is life style related diseases. Health is an important component of the concerns regarding adolescent issues. Obesity, lack of physical activity and exercise, mental and emotional stress are major concerns. The experiences gained as children often stay with us throughout life. Therefore there is a need to create health oriented school climate so that appropriate ambience is created which is sensitive to the health needs of school going children and helps to promote their well being. The new millennium schools must provide a setting where in education and health programmes come together to create a health promoting environment which in turn promotes learning. It must constantly strengthen its capacity as a healthy setting for learning and preparing for life. Such schools use its full organization potential to promote health among students, staff, families and community members. Schools need to provide a safe healthy environment which includes safe, clean water and sufficient sanitation facilities, freedom from abuse and violence, a climate of care, trust and respect, social support and mental health promotion. The school can work in the areas of Food and Nutrition, Knowing Your Body, Personal, Environmental Hygiene and Sanitation. Behaviour and Life Skills, Physical Fitness and Being Responsible and Safe. The Manual provides guidelines to all stakeholders including managers, principals, teachers and students. There are activities designed for different levels in the different volumes of the Manual. The first part of the Manual recommends setting up of a Health ans Wellness Club to further carry on these enrichment activities within the school. The ultimate objective of the Manual is to involve the school going child in making healthy life style choices. The Comprehensive School Health Manuals are an outcome of the collaborative effort of CBSE along with the guidance provided by WHO India. The Manuals would not have been possible but for the effort and support provided by the material production team. I would also like to thank Dr. Sadhana Parashar, Head (Innovation & Research) and Mr. Pramod Kumar T .K., Asst. Education Officer, CBSE for coordinating and editing the Manual. There are four volumes in the package. The First volume is Introductory and the other three consist of graded activities for each level : Primary, Upper Primary and Secondary as well as Senior Secondary. Any further suggestions for improving the Manuals are always welcome. Vineet Joshi CHAIRMANThe Board has strengthened the School Based Assessment and Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation in 2009-2010. As part of Comprehensive assessment of co-scholastic aspects, the grades obtained in Health and Physical Education will be reflected in the Report Card as well as Certificate of School Based Assessment. Learners can choose any two activities from the options provided.Advisors: Material Production: Contributors: Cover Page-Courtesy : Joshi (IAS) Cherian Varghese New Delhi.

This is largely to do with the aspect of school health which has somehow been relegated to sporadic health check-ups or in some cases a few hours of health instruction in the curriculum. It is imperative that something is done urgently to take up the issue of holistic health in school going children which includes physical, mental, emotional and psychological health. The School Health Policy and the Manual proposes to view health holistically, utilize all the educational opportunities for health promotion including formal and informal approaches in curricular pedagogy. Providing a safe school environment, an activity oriented health education curriculum to prevent health-related risk behavior, ensuring physical fitness activities and sports, providing nutritious snacks in the school canteen, ensuring access to primary health care services and integrated family and community activities and a staff health promotion policy are some of the expectations that a school should fulfill as was advised earlier in a circular issued to all the schools regarding the setting up of Health and Wellness Clubs. There are four Manuals in this package. The first Manual-Volume I is addressed to all stakeholders concerned with school health. A health promoting school strives to provide a healthy environment conducive to students' health, education and school health services along with school/community projects and outreach opportunities for physical education and recreation, social support and mental health promotion. School Health and Wellness Clubs can become the focal point of school health promotion which would encompass the entire school environment and become a school campus activity. A checklist for a Health Promoting School is included so that schools can monitor their own School Health Plan. The responsibilities of the Administrators, Principals, Teachers, Counsellors and Community leaders have also been enlisted. Monitoring, Evaluation and (i)About The Comprehensive School Health ManualsAbout The Comprehensive School Health ManualsSustainability of the Health Plan in each school is extremely essential. Fact Sheets regarding a Health Promoting School, focusing resources on Effective School Health and Improving School Performance through health promotion are other areas of concern. The other three Manuals are activity based manuals for teachers. Vol II is Teachers Activity Manual which consists of activities for Primary Level (Classes I-V), Vol III is Teacher's Manual for Upper Primary Level (Classes VI- VIII) and Vol IV is Teachers' Manual for Secondary and Senior Secondary Level (Classes IX-XII). The activities revolve around six different themes - Knowing your Body, Food and Nutrition, Personal, Environmental Hygiene and Sanitation Physical Fitness, Being Responsible and Safe and Behaviour and Life Skills. The objective of the modules and activities is to focus on the different aspects of growth and appropriate development of the child. will take the child from knowing body parts and their functions to appreciation of the importance of each body part. This will lead to heightened understanding of the need for correct information regarding growing up processes which will help in creating a well informed individual. focus on the effect of the right food and nutrition intake to generate positive energy and thus influence learning capacity. Variation in geographical location alter or modify nutritional intake. Food can effect energy levels, concentration and learning. emphasize on the need to ensure that children follow clean and regular habits regarding bath, bowel movement, sleep, oral hygiene, nails and hair. Once personal hygiene becomes a part of the regular system the child will look forward to having a cleaner environment. Sanitation activities have been added in the Revised Manual. Knowing Your Body Activities Food And Nutrition Activities Personal, Environmental Hygiene and Sanitation Activities (ii)Physical Fitness Activities Being Safe And Responsible Activities Behaviour And Life Skills Section will help children to maintain fitness, strengthen cardiovascular and respiratory system, keep bones and muscles strong, ease depression, manage pain and stress and above all make one feel alive, vibrant and energetic. help learners to understand the consequences of risk taking behavior and create a safe environment for themselves and others. This would lead to a better quality of personal life and would enhance positive behaviour towards self and environment. Security and an environment that is physically and emotionally safe is the need of the hour and equipping a child to handle situations that are age appropriate is the task of the school, family and community. focuses on bringing about an awareness and in-depth understanding of behavioural issues revolving around a child which will certainly influence his or her academic performance and social development. The module is an attempt to forge clarity for the teachers to facilitate the child's learning progress. The objective of the activities is to highlight self management and infuse skills within the child which will help him or her emerge as an individual who will be well equipped to handle related issues. The Manuals are holistic in their approach since they deal with not only physical health but also mental, social, emotional and spiritual well being. Their uniqueness lies in their participative and interactive approach. The activities mentioned can be easily incorporated in the classroom transaction, keeping in mind that hands on learning is internalized faster than conventional learning. It is also recommended that teachers may modify or customize the activities according to their social, cultural and demographic needs. The CBSE had also undertaken a Global School Health Survey across different types of schools in various parts of the country. This was to collect data on health behaviours and protective factors that affect the immediate (iii)and long term health status of young children. The results from the survey will help in policy formulation at the local and national level. The activities for teachers in each Section are suggestive and it is earnestly hoped that they will be implemented in the spirit of each section through curriculum plus intervention strategies within the school. The activities are learner centred and will help learners to empower themselves to acquire knowledge for themselves in a classroom or out of the class setting. The Board has strengthened the School Based Assessment and Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation in 2009-2010. As part of Comprehensive assessment of co-scholastic aspects, the grades obtained in Health and Physical Education will be reflected in the Report Card as well as Certificate of School Based Assessment. Learners can choose any two activities from the options provided. These include Sports/Indigenous Sports, NCC/NSS, Scouting and Guiding, Swimming, Gymnastics, Yoga, First Aid, Gardening / Shramdaan. Teacher may record observations about the student's participation over a period of time either in Anecdotal Records or a Portfolio. All students must take up at least two activities to ensure maximum health benefit in terms of physical fitness. The future of young India is being shaped in the schools and it is imperative that all of us take a proactive role in ensuring that healthy and balanced young minds leave school and forge ahead confidently. We wish teachers will find the Manuals useful and enrich them further with their wisdom and experience. It is an investment that each teacher, principal and parent must make to generate and augment creative and protective capacity of young people in school. This will go a long way in creating a sustainable, social, healthy and peaceful society. Dr. SADHANA PARASHAR HEAD (INNOVATION & RESEARCH) (iv)1Rationale For most children, `going to school' is a historic milestone in their lives. It is a place that plays one of the most important roles in their physical, mental and emotional development. Schools are settings where children learn, where character is moulded, where values are inculcated and where the future citizens of the world are groomed to face life's challenges. Schools are a strategic means of providing children with educational qualifications that will enable them to find employment and status in life. Schools can be dynamic settings for promoting health, for enabling children to grow and mature into healthy adults, yet the potential of the school to enhance health is often underutilized. `School Health' has largely remained confined to medical check-ups of children and / or some hours of health instruction in the curriculum. Today, schools present an extraordinary opportunity to help millions of young people acquire health supportive knowledge, values, attitudes and behaviour patterns. The students can serve as a means of promoting health of other children, their families and community members. Health is a multidimensional concept and is shaped by biological, physical, psychological, social, economic, cultural and political factors. There is a growing recognition that the health and psychosocial well-being of children and youth is of fundamental value and that the school setting can provide a strategic means of improving children's health, self-esteem, Life Skills and behaviour . There are various initiatives in school health at present, but most of them are topic based and age group specific and often rely on the initiative of the individual school or an agency . The comprehensiveness and sustainability in these initiatives are not clearly laid out. The need of the time is a Comprehensive School Health Policy integrated within the educational system at the National and State levels. This will harmonize the effective partnership of health and education sectors to facilitate the holistic approach to child and adolescent development in schools.1.1.Introduction to School Health Introduction to School HealthHistorical Review It has long been recognized that schools provide the most appropriate setting for both health services and health education for children and young persons. Globally , `school health' has been an important initiative for several decades, comprising largely of school health services and school health education. In 1960, the Government of India set up a Committee on School Health (Renuk a Ray Committee) which recommended that \"Health education should be included as part of general education in the primary , middle and secondary schools.\" The report of the Renuka Ray Committee (1961) provided guidelines and recommendations for both the content and the appropriate transaction of health education at various stages of schooling. In the wake of the National Policy on Education (1986, Revised 1992) and the National Health Policy 1983, steps were initiated to look at school health education in a more comprehensive manner . The National Health Policy, 2002 envisages giving priority to school health programmes which aim at preventive-health education, providing regular health check-ups, and promotion of health-seeking behaviour among children. The policy suggests that school health programmes can gainfully adopt specially designed modules in order to disseminate information relating to `health' and `family life'. This is expected to be the most cost-effective intervention as it improves the level of awareness, not only of the extended family , but the future generation as well. The noteworthy initiatives under this 2002 policy were setting up a well-dispersed network of comprehensive primary health care services linked with extension and health education. It is widely accepted that school students are the most impressionable targets for imparting information relating to the basic principles of preventive health care. The policy attempted to target this group to improve the general level of awareness with regard to `health promoting' behaviour . The girl child in the rural belt needs to be targeted right from school level. The policy recognized that the overall well-being of the citizen depended on the synergistic functioning of the various sectors in the society . The health status of the citizens would, inter alia, be dependent on adequate nutrition, safe drinking water , basic sanitation, a clean environment and primary education, especially for the girl child. The National Curricular Framework 2005 by NCER T has categorically stated that health is a critical input for the overall development of the child and it influences significantly enrolment, retention and completion of school. It advocates a holistic definition of health within which physical education and yoga contribute to the physical, social, emotional and mental development of a child. Undernutrition and communicable diseases are the major health problems faced by majority of children in this country from 2pre-primary through to the higher secondary school stage. Thus there is a need to address this aspect at all levels of schooling with special attention to vulnerable social groups and girl children. It has proposed that the mid-day meal programme and medical check ups be made a part of the curriculum and education about health be provided which address the age specific concerns at different stages of development. The idea of a Comprehensive School Health programme, conceived in the 1940's, included the following major components viz. medical care, hygienic school environment and nutritious school lunch and health and Physical Education. These components are important for the overall development of the child and hence need to be included as a part of the curriculum. The more recent addition to the curriculum is yoga. The entire group must be taken together as a comprehensive health and Physical Education curriculum, rather than the fragmentary approach current in schools today . As a core part of the curriculum, time allocated for games and for yoga must not be cut down or taken away under any circumstances. Given the interdisciplinary nature of health, there are many opportunities for cross curricular learning and integration. Activities such as the National Service Scheme, Bharat Scouts and Guides and the National Cadet Corps, are some such areas. The Sciences provide opportunities to learn about physiology , health and disease and the inter-dependence between various living organisms and the physical habitat. Social Science could provide insights into communities, health as well as understanding the spread, control and cure of infectious diseases, from socio-economic and global perspectives. This subject lends itself to applied learning and innovative approaches can be adopted for transacting the curriculum. The importance of this subject to the overall development needs to be reinforced at the policy level with the health department, administrators, other subject teachers in schools, the health department, parents and children. Recognizing health and Physical Education as core and compulsory , ensuring that adequate equipment for sports and yoga instructors are available, and that doctors and medical personnel visit schools regularly , are some of the steps that can be taken. Further this subject could be offered as an elective at the +2 level. The `need based approach' could guide the dimensions of physical, psycho-social and mental aspects that need to be included at different levels at schooling. A basic understanding of the concern is necessary , but a more important dimension is that of experience and development of health or skills and physique through practical engagements with play, exercises, sports and practices of personal and community hygiene. Collective and individual responsibilities for health and community living need to be emphasized. Several national health programmes like the Reproductive and Child Introduction to a Comprehensive School Health Program 3Health, HIV AIDS, tuberculosis and Mental Health have been targeting children as a focus with prevention in view. These demands on children need to be integrated into existing curricular activities rather than adding on. Yoga could be introduced from the primary level onwards in informal ways, but formal introduction of Asanas and Dhyana should begin only from class VI onwards. Even health and hygiene education must rely on the practical and experiential dimensions of children's lives. There can be more emphasis on the inclusion of sports and games from the local area. Indigenous knowledge in this area must be reflected at the local level. Policies make a difference . Appropriate and effective school health policies can have an impact on health behaviors, short-term health outputs, learning/academic achievement and social development. There is a need to develop a uniform, effective code of practice for school administrators and educators undertaking health promotion in schools. The WHO defines a health promoting school as one that is constantly strengthening its capacity as a healthy setting for living, learning and working. It focuses on creating health and presenting important causes of death, disease and disability by helping school children, staff, family and community to care for themselves, take informed decisions over circumstances that affect their health and create conditions that are conducive to health. School health education is comprehensive and meaningful when it; views health holistically , addressing the inter-relatedness of health problems and the factors that influence health within the context of the human and material environment and other conditions of life. utilizes all educational opportunities for health: formal and informal, standard and innovative approaches in curriculum and pedagogy . strives to harmonize health messages from various sources that influence students, including messages from the media, advertising, the community , health and development systems, family and peers and the school. empowers children and youth, as well as their families to act for healthy living and to promote conditions supportive of health. This policy is for the Central Board of Secondary Education and its affiliated schools and educational organizations. The policy will provide useful information to the community Comprehensive School Health Policy Who is the School Health Policy for? 4sector and other organizations that also have an interest in engaging in school based health initiatives. provide an effective guide for school administrators/educators to assist them in developing Health Promoting Schools. ensure that school health programmes are based on formally assessed and evidence based practice. advocate the value of a comprehensive and planned approach to school health through education sector . encourage partnerships for school health promotion with key stakeholders, viz students, parents, health professionals, teachers and counselors. The overall objective of the Policy is to equip the educational sector to develop Health Promoting Schools. 1.A school environment that is safe; that is physically , socially , and psychologically healthy; and that promotes health-enhancing behaviors; 2.A sequential Health Education curriculum taught daily in every grade, pre-kindergarten through twelfth, that is designed to motivate and help students maintain and improve their health, prevent disease, and avoid health-related risk behaviors and that is taught by well-prepared and well-supported teachers; 3.A sequential Physical Education curriculum taught daily in every grade, pre-kindergarten through twelfth, that involves moderate to vigorous physical activity; that teaches knowledge, motor skills, and positive attitudes; that promotes activities and sports that all students enjoy and can pursue throughout their lives; that is taught by well-prepared and well-supported staff; and that is co-ordinated with the comprehensive school health education curriculum; 4.A nutrition services program that includes a food service program and employs well- prepared staff who efficiently serve appealing choices of nutritious foods; a sequential program of nutrition instruction that is integrated within the comprehensive school health education curriculum and co-ordinated with the food service program; and a school environment that encourages students to make healthy food choices; What Does This School Health Policy Aim To Do? Components of the PolicyThe policy aims to: The eight components of the Comprehensive School Health Policy are: 565.A School Health Services Program that is designed to ensure access or referral to primary health care services; foster appropriate use of health care services; prevent and control communicable disease and other health problems; provide emergency care for illness or injury; and is provided for by well-qualified and well-supported health professionals; 6.A Counseling, Psychological, and Social Services Program that is designed to ensure access or referral to assessments, interventions, and other services for student's mental, emotional, and social health and whose services are provided for by well- qualified and well-supported professionals; 7.Integrated Family and Community Involvement activities that are designed to engage families as active participants in their children's education; that support the ability of families to support children's school achievement; and that encourage collaboration with community resources and services to respond more effectively to the health-related needs of students; and 8.A Staff Health Promotion Policy that provides opportunities for school staff to improve their health status through activities such as health assessments, health education and health-related fitness activities.

How to Implement The Policy? Key Messages for Plan of Action Strategy for action at national, state, district and community level17The Global School Health Survey aims at providing the profile of the students as Baseline in the following areas; Dietary behaviours Hygiene Personal health Clean drinking water Physical activity Protective factors HIV Infection or AIDS Awareness Tobacco use and smoking Alcohol and Drugs Sleep patterns Leisure Activities The Central Board of Secondary Education was involved with a Comprehensive School Health Programme and collaborated with WHO on a Global School Health Survey . A total of 75 schools under various categories were selected under this scheme by WHO on a random sampling basis. The Survey was conducted in 2007-2008 through a questionnaire which had various components related to physical growth, drinking and eating habits, personal health, safety concerns, feelings and emotions, substance abuse, physical fitness and personal experience. The school administration is advised to take up various initiatives as per the Health Promotion Manual specifically designed for the three major age groups, classes 1-5, 6-8 and 9-12. The checklist can be used to understand the current status and to guide the activities. A School Health and W ellness Club can be formed and can become the focal point of school health promotion. In addition to specific class room based activities and revising school health curriculum, the health promotion programme should encompass the entire school environment and should become a school campus activity . The health promotion programmes should inspire and motivate the teachers, students and parents and should be conceived in a participatory manner . The school should also strive to provide healthy living habits through a conducive environment. The health promotion initiatives can be assessed and based on a scoring system and the school can be declared as a Health Promoting School. Once the school achieves the status of a Health Promoting School, it should strive to maintain and excel in its initiatives and should become a model for other schools.

The nature and quality of School Health Education P rogrammes should be evaluated by the extent to which they achieve: a) Instruction intended to motivate health maintenance and promote wellness and not merely the prevention of disease or disability . b) Activities designed to develop decision-making competencies related to health and health behaviour . c) A planned, sequential pre-school to end-of-school curriculum based on student needs and current and emerging health concepts and societal issues. The content and terminology of the training curriculum for both students and teachers need to be made region-specific and resource-sensitive. Attractive and interesting communication methods should be used. To be effective, strategies need to be individualized, made context specific, sensitive, within a broad framework using modern day marketing techniques and strategies. !The mobilization of local resources !Ownership of the programme by the school !Training of teachers and health workers !Participation by parents and the community !The shared involvement of Government and NGOs from health education and other community services The main resource comes from teachers, children and parents. There is no school, however poor, that lacks the resource of children. 10Promoting School Health l l l l l l l l l l lA Health Promoting School : A Health Promoting School focuses on : Fosters health and learning with all the measures at its disposal. Engages health and education officials, teachers, all students, parents, health providers and community leaders in efforts to make the school a healthy place.

Influencing health-related behaviours: knowledge, beliefs, skills, attitudes, values and support. 1112Why should we become a Health Promoting School? When can we call ourselves a Health Promotin g School? Why are partnerships so important in Health Promoting Schools?The Health Promoting School's framework or model provides the most effective way that schools can promote health and well being for all members of the school communities: students, teachers, parents and the local communities around it. It's a global movement with a local focus. The model recognises the importance of the participation and consultation of all stakeholders in a school community . Priority is given to the specific health issues and needs of the school. There is an inbuilt reflection and evaluation process to effectively review and align programs within the setting of the school. A Health Promoting School encourages planning and co-ordinated action and use of resources rather than a reactive response to crises. It involves curriculum planning, whole school organisational alignment and partnerships with people and agencies to support programs and projects. A Health Promoting School is on a continuous and deepening journey . When a school has formed a representative committee, surveyed the school communities to clarify the needs and established an implementation plan with a time line for action, then it could be said to be a Health Promoting School. One off projects can initiate the process of becoming a Health Promoting School but one off project does not make a school health promoting. One or two people in a school community may get things started but forming a committee, setting up structures for communication and procedures, writing policies and implementing them are important parts of the process towards becoming a Health Promoting School. Internal partnerships become crucial for integrating the health promoting school framework into school culture. Even if the enthusiastic energy of one or two goes then the framework for health promotion is better able to continue and be taken up by others. The important feature of Health Promoting School is shared responsibility: the whole school needs to work in a collaborative way to implement projects and programs. Internal partnerships become crucial again. Teachers, Parents and students need to communicate, reach across and support the school. Health agencies can provide support for school program where it is required, delivering their support in relevant and effective ways.There are numerous community health issues that loom large: mental health, increasing weight and physical inactivity , sun protection and risks of skin cancer , drug and alcohol abuse, bullying and violence etc. A planned and co-ordinated approach to tackling any of these is crucial. Resources need to be better designed and utilised, funds must be targeted and spent effectively . Projects and programs need to be co-ordinated, linked or joined together . An issue can galvanise a team into action but instead of being in a reactive mode, a planned and co-ordinated approach is far better . You could say that the Health Promoting School approach is an organisational tool. Being a Health Promoting School is a great way to involve parents with the school community . Requests for support for tailored programs that fit with a bigger plan or goal can be drawn for parents. Whereas some may not come to a meeting, they may be happy to help set up a vegetable patch or talk to adolescents. Parents/ guardians do like to be consulted and participate in a vision of the school community when the health and well being of their children is concerned. The activities such as writing a policy or volunteering on a project can provide an opportunity for parent participation. Communication through newsletters, noticeboards and displays, information at PTM's (Parents Teacher Meetings) and conferences can help keep parents/guardians in touch. Student Representative Council and Student Health Committees are excellent teams who can help survey students about their health concerns and needs. Teachers, parents/guardians and students may have very different ideas about what is the most important health issue to address and the way that health activities are implemented. Consultation and the resulting discussions create the best foundation for student engagement, ownership of the process and student participation in the health issues relevant to their lives. Through the links to local health promotion sites you can find contacts to a wide range of How can we encourage parents/guardians to get involved in our School Health Programmes? How can we involve students in shaping our School Health Programmes ? Which organisations in the local community can help with our health programmes and plan ? 13organisations and agencies that support School Health Programs. You can tap resources available within the community . Depending on your project, funding through partnerships with community organisations and businesses can be a source of support. Staying in touch with information through the networks can keep you abreast of current funding opportunities. The three main areas of a Health Promoting School are : lThe Curriculum lThe School Ethos (Physical and Social Environment) lSchool-based health programmes can be Environment-Centred or Child-Centred. In this approach, the aim is to improve the educational climate of the school and to provide opportunities for child to utilize the School Health Programme. The positive mental health atmosphere includes the amount of time spent in school, the structuring of playground activities, the physical infrastructure of the school and the classroom decoration. aProgrammes/workshops can be organized to enhance the ability of administrators, teachers and support staff to deal with specific areas of emotional or behavioural disturbances that they encounter . bProgrammes for improving teachers' capacity to understand how to make use of other agencies providing mental health services for children. cNational campaigns to reduce the incidents of certain mental health damaging behaviours e.g., bullying, ragging, corporal punishment etc. dImprovement in the school's social environment can be brought about by encouraging parent participation through parent programmes in support of school activities. eA multidisciplinary mental health team can be established in the school to provide How can we get funding to support new ideas and initiatives? What kind of programmes can the school conduct? Implementation of School Health Programmes 1. Environment-Centred Approaches 14consultation in the management of student behaviour problems. fThe mental health team can include representatives from the governing body, teachers, support staff and parents. The governing body can identify problems and opportunities within the school. gThe school mental health team can monitor and evaluate the outcome and provide feedback so that appropriate modifications can be made to the programme. hSchool can be the centre for community enhancement projects including programmes to improve physical and emotional health. They can serve as training centres for parenting skills where parents learn more about child development and parent effectiveness skills and receive support to enhance feelings of self worth and competence. Such a programme provides a co-ordinated, collaborative effort to improve communication, understanding and respect between staff, students and parents. This provides a sense of direction and ownership of the programme. Child-centred approach includes individual mental health consultations and specific problem-focused interventions as well as more general classroom programmes to improve coping skills, social support and esteem. aA particular child who exhibits difficult behaviour can be referred to the school counsellor or mental health professionals. bThe counselor is involved in giving recommendations to the parents, the teachers and in some cases referral for treatment outside the school. cMaladjustment can be prevented by locating children at-risk and involving them in an 2. Child - Centred Approach What kind of programmes can the school conduct ? 15 16intensive goal-directed intervention that should include close contact with special educators, nodal teachers, counsellors and peer mentors. dThe use of parents as teacher's aides can be a helpful learning experience for the parents, the teacher and the child. Working in the classroom provides parents with perspective of their child as they observe other children and talk with other parents and the teacher . eEarly intervention programmes with high risk behaviours such as aggressiveness, smoking, excessive shyness, worsening of interpersonal relationships, poor school attendance, declining academic performances, irritable and fluctuating moods and changes in peer groups can prevent serious consequences. fSchool can also use screening tools for identification of psycho-social problems and mental disorders. This can help the schools in determining if children have (or are at risk of having ) significant mental health problems. Although, there is a danger of labelling and stigma nevertheless the instruments can be very useful in planning management strategies. gSchool based Health Centres located within the school have an important role in supporting better health care for children and adolescents. The mental health services in these school-based health clinics can provide screening, counselling for common adolescent concerns, information about substance abuse, HIV / AIDS, reproductive health, depression, stress, anxiety , etc. Because these clinics are located within the daily environment of the children mostly youth, they offer particular benefit to young people who might not otherwise receive assistance. Planning for a Comprehensive School Mental Health Programme begins with the collaboration of school personnel, family members, community members, health professionals and students who come together to create an environment that is productive, positive and supportive. Basic information regarding regional demographics, health risks and resources should be available for the team to consider . When possible, an assessment focusing on community strengths and available resources, as well as needs should be done to provide the planning team with the information they need to develop objectives.Steps In Setting Up School Health Programme Step 1: Establishment of a Team Step 2: Assessment of School and Community Environment 17Step 3: Development of a Plan Step 4: Monitoring and EvaluationOnce the need and potential for a mental health programme are assessed and most suitable elements of the model framework are chosen after discussions with parents, educators, student community members and mental health professionals, the next task is to develop a specific plan of action including clearly stated objectives, assignment of responsibilities, a time-line and a co-ordinating mechanism with an outside agency . Obtaining baseline data on the physical and emotional health of children, the quality of school health services, the environment of the school and the health knowledge, skills and practices of students are all essential for evaluating the effectiveness of a planned intervention. One approach to measuring outcomes which may be particularly useful for school-based health programmes utilizes goal attainment changes as the unit of measurement. Initially the team of school professionals, students, parents and community members meet with professionals, skilled in outcome research, to define how successful outcome will be defined in a way that can be measured reliably . The evaluation process is then planned, implemented and the outcome data analyzed and disseminated. The initial planning team meets again and discusses whether or not the goals were met and makes appropriate modifications.

Canteens in the schools should not be treated as commercial outlets. The schools carry a social responsibility towards inculcating healthy eating behav iors. They are used as places to motivate children to consume healthy and hygienic food. When a child sees other children consume foods with healthy components, their food choices get reinforced and also transmitted to the family back home. Stringent hygiene regulations to be strictly implemented in the canteen and serving area. Quality of fats/oils used for cooking to be monitored. Foods containing fatty acids to be banned or moderated. Strict control to prevent carryover of the left over food (healthy foods have a shorter shelf life-especially when the outside temperature is high). Use of whole grains and pulses should be encouraged wherever possible. Seasonal cheap and uncut fruits and locally available nuts/fruit seeds. Ban on use of preservative, colours and additives in the food preparation. Sale/serving of junk food like burgers, chowmein, chips, carbonated cold drinks to be banned in schools and colleges. Introduce freshly made vegetable pulao, idli-dosa, rajma-rice, dal-rice, milk, fresh lime juice, juices etc. in the canteen menu. Attractive pictorial stickers which communicate nutritional messages can be put in sections which sell nutritious foods. Healthy attractive posters in the canteen can reinforce the nutrition related messages.Health Intervention is Accepted and Most Effective if :- Canteens Carry a Health Responsibility : Creative Canteens Quality control measures to be observed in the school canteen: ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !19A Health Promoting School ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !Health is the responsibility of all. The lesson and experiences gained as children stay with us throughout life. So there is a need to develop a uniform effective code for school administrators and educationists to promote health in schools. This will harmonize the effective partnership of health and education sectors to facilitate a holistic approach to children and adolescent development in schools. Many of today' s and tomorrow' s leading causes of death and disease can be significantly reduced by preventing behaviour that is initiated during youth, through education, understanding and motivation and fostered by social and political conditions. A Health Promoting School is a setting where education and health programmes create a health promoting environment which in turn promotes learning. It constantly strengthens its capacity as a healthy setting for learning and preparing for life. Fosters health and learning with all the measures at its disposal. Engages health and education officials, teachers, teachers' unions, parents, health providers and community leaders in efforts to make schools a healthy place. Strives to provide a healthy environment, school health education health services along with school/community projects and outdoor promotion programmes for staff, nutrition and food, safety opportunities for Physical Education and recreation and programmes for counselling, social support and mental health promotion. Implements policies and practices that respect an individual' s welfare, dignity , provide multiple opportunities for success and acknowledge intentions as well as personal achievements. Strives to improve the health of school personnel, pupils as well as families and works with community leaders to understand how the community contributes or undermines education. Cares for oneself and others. Makes healthy decisions and takes control over life's circumstances. Creates conditions that are conducive to health. A School fostering health:20Basic Checklist for Health Promoting School Assessment should be made of the prevailing conditions in the school before starting the programme and also to review the progress made. The following checklist is a series of questions that SHC could ask itself for both base line assessment and monitoring of HPS. 1.Is there a Parent Teacher Association? 2.Does PTA address health issues? 3.Does the school actively engage with the village education committee / municipal education committee? 4.Are there linkages with the local health services? 1.Is clean drinking water available in school? 2.Are there hand washing and toilet facilities in school? 3.Are there separate toilet facilities for boys and girl?

School health policies will help promote inclusion and equity in the school environment. The policies are best developed if all the levels, be it state, national or school are actively involved in it. This approach focuses on the development of knowledge, attitudes, values and Life Skills which are needed to make and act on the most appropriate and positive health-related decisions. Health in this context extends beyond physical health and includes psycho- social and environmental health issues. Changes in social and behavioral factors have given greater prominence to such health related issues such as HIV/AIDS, injuries, violence, tobacco and substance abuse. The development of attitudes related to gender equity and respect between girls and boys, and the development of specific skills such as dealing with peer pressure are central to effective skills based health education and positive psycho-social environment building. When individuals have such skills they are more likely to adopt and sustain a healthy lifestyle during schooling and for the rest of their lives. Schools can effectively deliver some health and nutritional services provided that the services are simple, safe and familiar and address problems that are prevalent and recognized as important within the community . For example, micronutrient deficiencies and worm infections may be effectively dealt by sporadic (six-monthly or annual) oral treatment eg. by changing the timing of meals, or providing a snack to address short term hunger during school- an important constraint on learning which can contribute to better school performance. The school can carry proper health check ups and deal with the health problems faced by the students. Focusing Resources on Effective School Health seases c an di b 's e w p o r rr e o ve m n o t t e f d o b h y c uMh in Scho o lt ls ea t h od g a in y retsof27Provision of safe water and sanitation: Supporting Activities: Improving School Performance Through Health Promotion : Causes of low performance of students are many and varied:Hygiene education is meaningless without clean water and adequate sanitation facilities. It is a realistic goal in most countries to ensure that all schools have access to clean water and sanitation. By providing these facilities, schools can reinforce the health and hygiene messages, and act as an example to both students and the wider community . This in turn can lead to a demand for similar issues such as gender access and privacy . Separate facilities for girls, particularly adolescent girls are an important contributing factor to reduce dropout rate. Sound maintenance policies will help ensure the continuing safe use of these facilities. This is the first step towards creating a healthy school environment. The following activities provide the context in which the basic components can be implemented. Effective partnerships between teachers and health workers and between the education and health sectors Effective community partnerships Pupil awareness and participation Children cannot learn effectively until they are in good health. Similarly , it is not possible to acquire good health without good education. Thus it is in the interest of school to make best efforts to help the students acquire good health and improve it. In order to impart good health, we need to know the various causes of low performance of a student and how a school can a help a child to improve his/her performance. Physical and emotional disorders are the commonest causes of low performance of students. They can be greatly reduced by physical exercise and regular health care services. A combination of a good physical fitness programme with a healthy lifestyle programme has been recommended by the experts. A research study has demonstrated a correlation in levels of hunger , poverty , nutrition and academic performance. It has been found that chronically under-nourished children achieve lower scores on standardized achievement tests, especially language ability tests. 28Research has shown that physically fit middle school students score higher grades and exhibit higher levels of self esteem than non fit students. Malnutrition / chronic hunger , use of drugs, alcohol and tobacco have negative consequences in terms of school performance. All these factors can make learning and concentration more difficult. There are certain factors such as learning disorders or behavioural disorders which need appropriate diagnosis by a health professional. If detected at the right time and at the right age, they can be addressed and remedial action taken to ensure improved performance in school. H. Gardner in delineating his theory of multiple intelligence has identified seven types of intelligence : Linguistic, Logical-Mathematical, Spatial, Musical, Kineasthetic, Interpersonal, and Intra-personal. It is important to use varied learning strategies to ensure a broad based approach to intelligence to better school performance in both the scholastic and co-scholastic domain. Empirical evidence based on research work undertaken in several countries shows that increased sports activity behavioural results in better academic perfor-mance besides leading to a significant reduction in crime, growth in leadership and team spirit and greater social inclusiveness and cohesion. Chronic illness Lack of Study SkillsChronic Hunger and MalnutritionFactors including Emotional DisordersLow performancePhysical factorsLearning DisordersSubstance abuseBehavioural Disorders Yoga at School29A holistic curriculum which focuses on health and wellness among children in schools needs to address the areas of physical, emotional, social, intellectual and spiritual well being among them. Any survey of statistical data reveals that society today and specifically the youth are facing an onset of early diseases related to lifestyle. Behaviour patterns and dietary habits acquired during childhood often have a profound impact on their later life. The curriculum is, for the sake of convenience, divided into following six areas and themes which can help the school to improve its performance. They are merely suggestive in nature and teachers are encouraged to use these themes and the ideas provided under them as take off points for further reference. Each theme has been sub divided into further sub-themes which should form a part of the co- curricular or curriculum plus activities being organised in the area of Physical and Health Education in Schools.

Physical Activity in Schools ! ! ! ! ! !Physical Fitness The benefits of sport and other form of physical activity on health reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases, strokes, diabetes and obesity which is a serious concern even among school going children. Physical fitness is the capacity to carry out various forms of physical activities without being unduly tired and includes qualities important to the individual's health and well-being. The Comprehensive National Sports Policy 2007 aims at building on previous sports policies with a view to accomplishing the unfinished agenda and addressing the emerging st challenges of India in the 21 century most particularly the national goal of emerging as a global, yet inclusive economic power in the near future. The 2007 Policy fully recognizes the contribution of Physical Education and sport to personal development, especially youth development, community development, health and well-being education, economic development and entertainment and in the promotion of international peace and brotherhood, which is the spirit of Olympism. It therefore, recognises the need for sport to permeate all sections of society and become a way of life. (Draft Policy 2007, Sport Bureau, Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sport, GOI) Every school should have a playground. School should be penalised if adequate play ground space is not available. Minimum of five periods a week for physical activity need to be made mandatory . Traditional games like Kho-Kho, Kabbadi, Dances, Yoga and Aerobics must be promoted in school. Mass PT s should be encouraged in schools. 'Sports week' can be conducted twice a year . More emphasis should be given on being physically active and enjoyment of physical activity rather than just winning competitions and excelling. Ensure safe cycling and walking pathways to school.38! !Dance is a wonderful form of physical activ ity and is also a great stress reliever . India has a rich cultural tradition of classical and folk dances unique to each state and region. Dances of India both classical and folk forms need to be introduced with increased vigour in the schools. These need to be group and class activities in schools, where children dance and enjoy rather than few students taking part in the functions. It has been seen that the quality of the physical activ ity instructor has a direct co- relation to the amount of physical activ ity happening in any school. Sport, games and physical fitness have been a vital component of our civilization, as is evident from the existence of the highly evolved system of yoga and a vast range of highly developed indigenous games, including martial arts. Sport and Physical Education offered by a school can help to build personal attributes that are important for holistic development. Strength AgilityMuscular Endurance Power FlexibilityCardio-respiratory Endurance SpeedPhysical Fitness 39Self esteem Health and wellness Appropriate behaviour Appreciation of ethics and fairplay Interpersonal relationships Intra-personal relationships Coping with stress Coping with emotions The United Nations Gener al Assembly celebr ated 2005 as the \"Year of Sport and Physical Education\" thereby emphasizing the need to integrate sport and physical education into the overall development agenda. This initiative highlighted sports as: (i)being integral to quality Education with mandatory Physical Education as a necessary pre-requisite to foster education, health and personality development; (ii)improving the health standards of people; (iii)achieving sustainable development through inclusive growth; and (iv)building lasting peace. This quality enables a person to continue engaging in reasonably vigorous physical activities for extended periods of time. This quality enables a person to sustain localized muscle group activities for extended periods of time. Strength is the amount of muscular force one is capable of exerting in a single muscular contraction. Speed is the ability to make rapid movements of the same type in the shortest possible time. Ability of human body to change direction quickly and effectively . It's the ability of muscle to perform movements with large amplitude. It also refers to the functional capacity of joints to move through normal range of motions.Cardio-respiratory Endurance: Muscular Endurance: Participation in Games and Sports Regular P hysical Activity is required for an individual to develop and maintain fitness. The dosage of exercise should be progressively increased to guarantee the improvement of physical fitness level of an individual. The exercise programme should be designed in such a way that it should exercise every part of the body to ensure proportionate body development. The nature and the type of exercise programme should be specific to the component of physical fitness to be developed. Before starting an exercise programme a brief session of warming up is recommended. Just as the body needs warming up, it also needs gradual cooling down after the exercise. Adequate amount of rest and sleep are vital for regular participation in a fitness programme. If done regularly contributes to development of cardio-respiratory endurance. The term aerobic literally means 'with oxygen' . During aerobic training a continuous supply of oxygen by the body is maintained in order to burn carbohydrates and fats for production of energy for these activities. Various activities such as jogging, cycling, calisthenics and rhythmic exercises can be taken up. Regular participation in indoor and outdoor games and sports provides sufficient exercise to the human body. There are some games which are more vigorous than the others. Participation in vigorous activities can bring about significant improvement in physical fitness of an individual and to maintain physical fitness some sort of regular participation in games and sports is desirable for a change. \"Our effort is to see that sports becomes a means for shaping the character of our youth. Through sport they must learn to excel as individuals. They must also learn to play together as a team. We must see that sports are for sports sake and not for winning or losing.

Children lead happier lives as a result of being actively involved in sporting activities and it has long been established that fitness and improved academics performance go hand in hand. Physical Education and Sports activities during the school hours reduce boredom and help keep students attentive in the classrooms. The Board is of the firm opinion that the Physical Education & Sports programs teach important conflict resolution skills including team work, fair play and communication leading to reduced violent behaviour among children. Further , children who participate in Physical Education & Sports develop a positive attitude towards their every day life activities. In the above background, it is advised that the following in respect of the Physical Education & Sports may be strictly adhered to : a) There should be at least 40-45 minutes of Physical Activities or Games period for Classes I-X everyday . b) For Classes XI-XII it should be ensured that all the students participate in Physical Activity/Games/Mass P.T./Yoga with maximum health benefits for at least two periods per week (90-120 min/week). c) In case the school has constraints of space, climate conditions, presence of enough PE Teachers, or coaches it may consider indoor activities which would provide maximum health benefits (Aerobics/Meditation/Y oga & Asanas). d) Mass P.T. in the morning keeping in view the climate conditions is another alternative the school can have. As part of Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation the students will be assessed on participation and performance in by choosing any two activities from the 13 activities given for Classes VI-VIII and 08 activities given for Classes IX-X.44CBSE Inter School Sports & Games Competitions 1996-2010 Origin Structure Strengths \"Determine Strive Achieve\" Growth THE DISCIPLINES, AGE GROUPS & LEVEL OF COMPETITION : In order to supplement the academic efforts put in by the CBSE for the promotion of Physical Education a need was being felt for quite some time that the class room teaching in Physical Education could be appropriately utilized on the play fields.

The Board introduced the annual Physical Education T eacher's Award in the year 2005 that is given to the teacher for contribution in the promotion of Physical Education & Sport at school level. In the year 2005-2006, the Chacha Nehru Sport Scholarship was introduced by the Board for the outstanding talent performance during the CBSE Inter School Sports & Games Competitions. The CBSE envisages this activity for the school going children as very important segment of personality development and career building besides the essential ingredient in achieving health and fitness objectives. The Board is hopeful that with recognition of CBSE Inter School Sports & Games Programme the performance will further improve which will help the country identify young talent.

Accident is an unexpected event, which interrupts normal procedure and may lead to injury or be fatal. Each day more people die in road accidents. Accidents can be prevented. Accidents may have an adverse effect on the physical as well as emotional well being of a person for a long time. Accidents may occur:- On the road: crossing, narrow streets, driving, cycling, walking plants and animals Bad env ironment- which includes badly maintained roads, poorly maintained vehicles and bad planning. Bad behav iour-which includes carelessness, haste, ignorance, taking risks and lack of knowledge.Coping With Emergency Accidents Why Do Accidents Occur?D D D 49How To Prevent Accidents? Accidents can be prevented if everyone keeps the following things in mind: ABC of safety-always be careful. Avoid playing with fire. Take care while working with tools. Always form a queue. Drive slowly on road. It is better to be late than never arrive . Cross the road properly . Do not tease animals. Safe use of fire at home. Arrange all the school sports material into two piles depending on whether they are safe or unsafe to play with. Handle the electric cord properly , never use the electrical appliance with wet hands or without footwear , store the electrical appliance in a safe place. The best way to reduce injuries is by wearing protective devices. Note: When we walk or drive on the road there are some spots, which can be dangerous, like the turns, the crossing, the broken footpaths, electricity poles and the telephones lines. 506.Behaviour And Life Skills Concept of Life Skills Key Life SkillsLife skills are abilities for adaptive and positive behaviour that enable individuals to deal effectively with the demands and challenges of everyday life. They are abilities that facilitate the physical, mental and emotional well-being of an individual (WHO). Life skills that we might assess through the Performance Appraisal Card on a five point grading scale are given below: Thinking Skills Social Skills Self Awareness Communication Creative Thinking Interpersonal Skills Critical Thinking Coping with Stress Problem Solving Dealing with Emotions Decision Making Empathy In recent years, the concept of Life Skills has become popular , particularly in the context of adolescent health. WHO, while initiating Life-Skills education, conceptualised Life Skills as psycho-social competence. Psycho-social competence is an individual' s ability to maintain a state of mental well-being and to demonstrate this through adaptive and positive behaviour while interacting with others and with his/her culture and environment. Adaptive means that a person is flexible in approach and is able to adjust to different circumstances. Positive behaviour means that a person is forward-looking and that even in difficult situations he/she can find a ray of hope and find solutions to problems. Life Skills include psycho-social competencies and interpersonal skills that help people to make informed decisions, solve problems, think critically and creatively , communicate effectively , build healthy relationships, empathise with others, and manage their lives in a healthy and productive manner . Essentially , there are two kinds of skills\u2014those related to thinking called Thinking Skills and those related to dealing with others called Social Skills. While Thinking Skills relate to reflection at a personal level, Social Skills relate to interpersonal skills and do not necessarily depend on logical thinking. It is the combination of these two types of skills that are needed for learning assertive behaviour and negotiating effectively . Negotiation may be seen as a skill not only in making rational decisions but also in being able to make others agree with one's point of view. To do that, 51it is important to first come to terms with oneself. Thus, Self-Management is an important skill calling for managing and coping with one's feelings, emotions, and stress and resisting peer and family pressure. Young people as advocates need both thinking and social skills for consensus building and for advocacy on issues of concern. Self-awareness means the recognition of 'self' and of our character , our strengths and weaknesses, our likes and dislikes. Developing self-awareness can help us in recognising when we are stressed or feel under pressure. It is often a pre-requisite to effective communication and interpersonal relations as well as for developing empathy for others. Empathy is the ability to understand what life is like for another person, even in a situation with which we may not be familiar . Empathy can help to accept others who may be very different from us. This can improve social interactions, especially in situations of ethnic or cultural diversity . Empathy can also encourage the adoption of a nurturing attitude towards people in need of care and assistance or tolerance and understanding, as in the case of people with mental disorders, who may be stigmatised and ostracised by the very people on whom they depend for support. Critical thinking is the ability to analyse information and experiences in an objective manner . It can contribute to healthy living by helping us in recognising and assessing the factors that influence attitudes and behaviour , such as values, peer pressure, and the media. Creative thinking is a novel way of seeing and doing things. It consists of four components \u2014 fluency (generating new ideas), flexibility (shifting perspective easily), originality (conceiving something new), and elaboration (building on other ideas).The Ten core Life Skills are: 52Decision making helps us to deal constructively with important issues in our lives and take appropriate action. This can have consequences for healthy living. It teaches us how to be proactive in making decisions about our life in relation to a healthy assessment of the different options available and in determining what effects these different decisions are likely to have. Problem Solving helps us to deal constructively with problems in our lives. Significant problems that are left unresolved can cause mental stress and give rise to accompanying physical strain. Interpersonal Relationship Skills help us to relate in positive ways with the people with whom we interact. This means being able to maintain friendly relations with family , friends and colleagues, which can be of great importance to our mental and social well- being as well as an important source of social support. Interpersonal Relationship Skills also mean being able to end relationships constructively without bitterness and anger . Effective communication means that we are able to express ourselves both verbally and non-verbally , in ways that are appropriate to our cultures and situations. This means being able to express our opinions and desires, and also our needs and fears. It means being able to ask for advice and help in times of need. Coping with stress means recognising the sources of stress in our lives, recognising how stress affects us and acting in ways that help us control these levels of stress by changing our environment or lifestyle and by learning how to relax. Dealing with Emotions means recognising our emotions as well as those of others, being aware of how emotions influence behaviour , and being 53able to respond to emotions appropriately . Intense emotions like anger or sadness can have an effect on our health if we do not respond appropriately . The process of categorising the various Life Skills may inadvertently suggest distinctions among them. However , many Life Skills are inter-related and several of them can be taught together in a learning activity . Syllabus processes involved with planning lessons should establish a practice ground for learners to employ skills in everyday living that enables them to deal effectively with the demands and challenges which may confront them. Such adaptive and positive behaviour is needed in receiving health promoting messages, in developing values and in solving health problems at their level of understanding. The methodology involved in the Life Skills processes include the following: The skill of clear, effective verbal and non-verbal self-expression and listening in culturally appropriate manner . The skills to analyse information in an objective way to challenge cultural and other norms. The skill needed to internalize knowledge, identify options, select appropriate responses (even under pressure) in order to take clear-headed, unbiased and constructive action in any given situation. The skill involved in clearly identifying, analysing and describing a problem. The skill to examine critically and to determine the essential features of a situation or matter so that clear exposition and understanding is resolved. The skill of working or acting together or jointly to meet a situation or solve a problem. The skill of organizing, arranging and designing a scheme of action to undertake a project or solve a problem. Integration of Life Skills Communicating: Critical Stress: A Health Education Life Skills FrameworkAt some point of time the learner is going to make a personal decision at the level of thought, attitude, claimed point of view or course of action, regarding their lifestyle and health. There is a need to ensure that she/ he makes an informed choice. It involves recognizing and dealing appropriately with emotions within ourselves and others. The learner should be able to handle stress of various types that arise in life. After identifying the six broad areas which can help the school to improve its performance it is necessary that they should follow a strategy to present a simple health concept, which is important for the child in the class, in the school and in the community . It must be relevant to learner needs and should involve the learner in a practical way. Negotiating Critical Thinking Analysing PlanningPersona l Choice Listening Valuing Problem Solv ingCommunicating InteractingLife Skills and Sub Skills55The following points should be taken care of while framing a methodology for students: \u00d8 Based on meeting with the Student Representative attempt a real health need analysis of the school. Students benefit most if the work is interesting . It must be relevant and impact the real world they live in. \u00d8 Involve participation in planning for the student's growth for future life. \u00d8Give opportunity to discover learning through investigation and experimentation. It should involve active participation of each student. It should give the student things to do and create a health practice ground. \u00d8Permit sharing of ideas through discussion, communication techniques, group activities and writing. \u00d8Involve creative, child-centered activities. \u00d8Be simple, utilize a simple concept and reinforce it in a number of ways. \u00d8Use a variety of methods and strategies to more effectively communicate the message to the students. \u00d8Convey the health message that is important. \u00d8Use methods which are the part of the learning process involved and which in themselves teach and reinforce living skills. Encourage the student to take the health message to the family. 56LEARNING to LEARN group work communications peer teaching games discussions (e.g. conflict resolution, games assertiveness, dance negotiation) playground meetings debates play excursions recreation school visits and outdoor role plays adventure drama games pursuitsInteractive Activities ll ll l l l ll ll l l l l l Decision Making Activities l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l lmoral dilemmas skills/practices open-ended group and stories pair work discussions action plan question-answer flow chart values- timelines continuums research obstacle courses situation analysis team strategy plays planning trial and error problem solving values clarification hypotheticals conflict resolution Creative Learning To Activities Appreciate Activities l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l play / street theatre reviews improvisations reports collages group work pictures sensory experience poems (e.g. tasting, listening) simulation games literature mimes rating scales dance self-assessment gymnastics, peer assessment sequencing games values clarification diagrams media analysis problem solving interviews surveys surveys experiments diaries observation of performance (e.g. ideas, audience) 57Healthy Environment in the School A Child Friendly School means: !Quality learning : !Quality content : !Quality teaching learning processes : !Quality learning environments : !

All these have an important bearing on the learning behavior and health of children and teachers. healthy , well nourished, ready to learn and supported by the family and community . curricula and materials for literacy , numeracy , knowledge, attitudes and skills for life. child centered, skill based approaches and technology . policy and practices, facilities(class room, water sanitation) services (safety physical and psycho-social health). knowledge, attitudes and skills, suitable assessment at classroom and end of the year examination levels. The establishment and development of a school building and surroundings to make them health promoting and visually attractive is essential. Classrooms of proper size with glare free black boards fitted at the eye level of the students. Furniture should be suited to height of students and conducive to comfort and good posture, good lighting and ventilation. Library with quiet reading space with good light and ventilation. Auditorium, assembly hall(s), gymnasium all free from hazardous fixtures and with adequate light and ventilation. Stairways not too steep and wide fitted with two railings at appropriate heights for tall and short students with adequate light. Facility for safe drinking water (tested by appropriate authority) with adequate number of water taps or drinking fountains and facility for washing hands. Separate sanitary urinals and toilets in adequate numbers for boys and girls with proper 1) Physical environment58ventilation and lighting. Canteen and eating places with hygienic arrangement for preparation, storage and serving of food including facilities for dish-washing and disposal of waste and garbage. Proper health unit with medical examination and isolation facilities. Sanitary swimming pool with separate shower rooms for boys and girls duly approved by licensing authorities. School garden with adequate watering arrangements. Proper sewage, drainage and garbage disposal arrangements. School buses and drivers, or any other school transport authority or department of education keeping in view the safety of students. Hazard free play area and play equipment. Fire extinguishers and facilities for quick evacuation of school building in case of fire and exit doors opening toward outside. Aesthetic decors inside school premises, classrooms, library, auditorium, assembly halls, gymnasium, canteen, medical unit and corridors. Dustbins at appropriate places. Healthy teachers and other school personnel including food handlers in school canteen or cafeteria. It includes stress management, encouragement to work towards goals, a spirit of non-violence and the 59learning situations in and out of the class room which will enable the students to analyze situations critically , solve problems, make decisions and to learn from consequences of their actions. An atmosphere of love, care and concern, of tolerance towards one another is important and development of responsibility among children is essential so that the students have a real investment in actions and behavior in the school. An outlook of positive encouragement should extend to every classroom with each pupil being viewed as a valid and valued member of the school community . Emotional environment can be created through : Group activities which promote togetherness, friendliness, mutual understanding, consideration of others and a sense of belonging. Feeling of concern, caring, closeness, trust and confident- iality. Being just and fair in dealings, respect for feelings and emotional outburst of companions. Tolerance about the shortcomings of friends. Opportunities to taste success and enjoy the fruits of success. Mentally healthy teachers. Public policy which sees the school as a center of nation's development and resources is accordingly essential. More importantly a community which sees its children as responsible agents for change has a potential for a healthy future. The adolescents of today grow up in an environment that surrounds them with mixed messages about smoking, substance abuse , use of alcohol, etc. The onset of the use of tobacco, alcohol and other drugs generally occurs during adolescence. Many teenagers experiment with these substances and then use them to the point that their behaviour interferes with school, family , social relationships and general productivity . Tobacco and alcohol are the most common drugs used by young people. \u00d8 \u00d8 \u00d8 \u00d8 \u00d8 \u00d8 3) Tobacco-free environment 28 60Use of tobacco in any form including passive smoking causes several diseases. Prominent among these diseases are: Cancers of different parts and organs of body especially oral cancer (cancer of mouth and throat). Respiratory diseases like pneumonia and emphysema. High blood pressure. Heart diseases. Low birth weight children born to smoking mothers. Infections of lower respiratory tract in children under 18 months of age born to parents who smoked. To smoke or not to smoke is an important personal decision an individual has to take. However , to enable him to take this decision he or she has to convince himself or herself about the scientific knowledge produced by research about the harmful effects of tobacco on health and strategies that have been successfully tried (i) to reduce the risk of tobacco, if he or she must continue to use it or (ii) how to stop the use of tobacco products. Children need to make use of various methods/techniques to avoid the use of tobacco/alcohol: Delay Techniques - Don't take any decisions until you have had time to think it over. Negotiation Technique - Try to find a decision you think is acceptable to both the parties. Refusal Techniques - 'No, thank you' technique gives a reason to ensure one can walk away, avoid the situation, cold shoulder , change the subject, humour , state a health problem or reverse the pressure. F F F F F F F F F 61Childhood and adolescence form the most joyful period of an individual's life. They are times of immense creative energy , self-discovery and exploration of the world. They can also be fraught with feelings of isolation, loneliness and confusion. They can be due to various factors relating to the physical, social, emotional, mental and spiritual well being of the younger generation. Schools, families and communities need to play a positive and responsible role in bringing up young children in a healthy environment which would enable each one to maximize their potential. School life is filled with many opportunities for health promotion and teaching. Throughout the day children are exposed to many situations which influence their thoughts, feelings and habits. By careful planning, various activities can be included to promote health in the school. One of the activities which may be successful is creation of a Health and Wellness Club. Schools can be dynamic settings for promoting health, for enabling children to grow and mature into healthy adults. Yet the potential of the school to enhance health is often underutilized. School Health has largely remained confined to medial check-ups of children or some hours of health instruction in the curriculum. There is a growing recognition that the health and psycho-social well-being of children and youth is of fundamental value and the schools can provide a strategic means of improving children's health, self-esteem, life skills and behaviour . Although schools have undertaken many initiatives in promoting school health, the comprehensiveness and sustainability in these initiatives is not clearly laid out. The need of the hour is a comprehensive school health policy integrated within the school system. Healthy living in case of school children is the prime concern of all stakeholders including principals, parents, teachers and the community . To achieve this objective collective responsibility needs to be assumed. An important dimension is that of experience and development of health skills and physique through practical engagements with play, exercises, sports and practices of personal and community hygiene. Health and Wellness Clubs in Schools focus on the overall well being comprising emotional, social and mental health of the child. It acts as the enabling and organizational point for conducting activities related to various dimensions of health and wellness. A Health Card needs to be created for students which would form a continuous part of their growth and development. This could form an effective monitoring and feedback system for the overall health of a child during schooling.Need For Creating Health and Wellness Clubs in SchoolsComprehensive School Health Programme and Creating Health Clubs in the school.4.4.School Health & Wellness Clubs School Health & Wellness Clubs62Constitution of a Health and Wellness Club Responsibilities of the Health and Wellness Club Objectives of the Health and Wellness Club Principal as Convener .

To organize health fairs and immunization projects. To tap the local resources in the community to arrange health talks. To render service in any area affected by a disaster or a calamity . To create health help-line within the school to de-stress, cope with emotional and social behaviour and to clarify misconceptions regarding sexual and reproductive health. 63 School Health and Wellness Clubs can also help to : \u00d8 \u00d8 \u00d8To teach the students techniques of yoga and meditation from an early age . To inculcate in the students healthy and positive ways of living. To teach health songs on various health topics. Celebration of important days (World Health Day-April 7). Creating awareness regarding World No Tobacco Day (May 31), World AIDS Day (December 1) etc. The Principal may be the patron of the Club. The Counselor/Psychologist, Trained Physical Education teacher and Doctor/Nurse may be sponsors of the club. The Principal may nominate 3 teachers as co-sponsors of the club. They can be chosen from 3 levels (Primary , Upper Primary and Senior). 2 students from each level can also be nominated and a parent from each level can be included in the Club.

A group system is desirable in order to arrange the Health Club activities according to the needs, interests and understanding of the children. With the close co-operation of the patron and co-sponsors and the sponsor , activities can be conducted. In order to maintain sound communication a staff meeting can be conducted before the commencement of the activities. The course and mode of action of the Club should be discussed. Meeting of the Club may take place before school, or after school in a special Club period during the day. \u00d8Health themes from Health Education classes may serve as topics of action by the Club. Children can be taught health songs on various health topics. Health films can be shown at meetings. A health library/health corner can be developed along the following lines: Schools can subscribe to health magazines, pamphlets, booklets, posters and other publications published by the public health government, WHO, UNICEF, etc. These materials can find permanent display place in the school library . Periodical displays of health information on bulletin boards can be undertaken on a regular basis. These should be changed regularly . Many celebrations can be organized and celebrated such as World Health Day (April 7), World No Tobacco Day (May 31), World AIDS Day (December 1), etc which can be included in the school calendar . Health excursions can be arranged. Health talks can be arranged in the Morning assembly . Immunization projects can be organized. Screening activities can be undertaken such as vision screening, screening for nutrition deficiency disease, skin problems, dental problems etc. Weekend tours of health related faculties may be organized. Action through parent organizations; for protected water supply etc. can be initiated. Combined activities with School Health Committee can be organized with teachers and parents .65\u00d8 \u00d8 \u00d8 \u00d8 \u00d8P Quiz programmes on various aspects of health can be organized. Health Fair or Health Melas can also be carried out by the members of the Club. Conducting plays, role-plays, and dramas can be very effective ways of reinforcing the ideas of health. The Club members may plan the situation and then children can act out the dialogue and responses that seem natural for the situation. Puppet Shows: The puppet play has attracted the attention and interest of children and adults through the ages. A simple appropriate stage may be constructed using timber or curtains. The Club members can initiate a script that may increase student's interest in written expression. Simple experiments may be devised by the Club members so that concepts such as nutrition, environmental health may be well understood by the students. articipation in 66 Yoga and meditation Assembly themes Tapping resources from neighbour- hood / community for health, hygiene and personality Introspection diary Survey of eating joints for their nutritive content Health Card Any other ...

School take precautionary measures to prevent health hazards in the school premises. The school authorities have to monitor health with both curative and preventive measures. Schools must appoint a qualified and certified medical practitioner to attend medical calls in the school premises round the clock. The school doctor should be available almost round the clock on all days of the academic year. He / she must be responsible for running the hospital and medical services in the campus, deciding on consultants, advising principal, staff and students on health matters, imparting first-aid training to the students and staff, looking after preventive aspects of health and advising them on preventive aspects of various diseases and conditions. The school doctor , school hospital and outside consultants play a preventive role in maintaining health in the school. School clinics should have a compounder or a nursing assistant and cleaning staff to run the clinic. The school doctor should check the students and write the prescription. The nurse should give the medicine to the ailing student according to prescription. The prescription must be kept in Student medical file after it is served. The school doctor should take into account the history and examine the child to reach a provisional diagnosis. This can be confirmed by investigations and second opinion if required. The school doctor after reaching a provisional diagnosis must write the treatment which can be modified after investigations if required. Every day treatment should be reviewed after checking the child's condition and progress. Expiry date of all medicines oral or injectable should always be checked before administering. Sufficient care must be taken to check cross infection in the clinic. A few medicines could be stored in the clinic, rest must be procured when required. The medical history of every child should be on hand. This medical history should have two sections. One section is to be answered by the parents and other section to be answered by the family physician. This questionnaire must contain information about the student and his/her family health. 73Health Care In The School : Health Check-up, Health Card & First AidHealth Care In The School : Health Check-up, Health Card & First Aid5.5.\u00d8 How To Do An Overall General External Examination:Standing instructions in the written mode to be given to games in charge, catering managers and other persons concerned about a child with chronic illnesses like asthma or epilepsy by the school doctor or nurse. Importance: Doing a general medical examination to access a child's health is not difficult. It is a very simple and routine procedure and gives a good and general idea about the child's health based on which you can definitely conclude whether a child is healthy or not. (a)Walk (normal/limps) (b)Overall appearance (tidy/untidy) (c)Scalp/hair (Smiling or sad) (f)Eyes (bright or dull) (g)Nose and ear (discharge from nose or not) (h)Deformity (ear/cleft/lips/shape of hands or legs) (i)Vaccination (BCG scar indicates that child may have taken all vaccines) (a) Has the child passed worms in stools? (b) Is the child presently suffering from any complaints viz. fever, diarrhoea, cough, earache, headache, severe pain in any part of the body? (c) Is the child taking any treatment? (d) Does the child have any history of Epilepsy , TB, or health disorders? Inference and action to be taken only after completing general and medical examination. The doctor will be able to conclude whether the child is healthy or not. If the child is found to be unhealthy or suffering from any problem and needs treatment, he/she may be referred to a hospital or an expert.1. Observe (from head to toe as the child enters the medical room) 2. Conduct a general medical examination (step by step) 3. Ask questions 74Recording Weight Correctly: Recording Height Correctly: l l l l lImportance : Measuring a child's weight is one of the earliest ways of monitoring her/his growth and development. Weight depends on age and height of a child. Hence there will be differences in weights of children. Recording a child's weight regularly and serially is more important than a single reading alone. Improper weight for age is a cause for concern and it indicates that a child may not be healthy . lSet the weighing machine at zero. lMake the child stand on the machine with both feet on either side of the dial. lRecord the weight. Do's/ Don't while taking weight: Ensure correctness by removing the parallax. Ensure that scale is set at zero every time before weighing each child. Weigh with only light wear. Inference: Check whether it is within the acceptable normal limit or it is less than or more than normal. If less or more refer to expert. Importance: Measuring a child's height regularly is one very important assessment. It is an indicator showing that she/he is growing normally and is healthy . Improper height for age is a cause for concern and it indicates that child may not be healthy . Inadequate gain in height is also a cause for concern. Make the child stand against a vertical scale (fixed on stand/pasted on wall). Child should stand comfortably with heels, buttocks, shoulders and head touching the wall and the feet parallel . Mark the height point of the head on the wall. Measure. Record the height.Procedure: Procedure: 75Do's / Dont' s while taking height: l l Inference: How to look for anemia ?(eyes, tongue, palms) Importance: Procedure : Inference : Routine Dental Check Up : Importance : Procedure: l l l l l l l a steel measuring tape or special graph scale to be used never use a tailor's tape. Generally there is an increase in height between 2cm every year. If height does not increase serially refer the child to an expert. Haemoglobin has a very important function of carrying oxygen to all the parts of the body including brain where it is vital for all higher functions like concentration, memory and the like. Anaemia can also be corrected. Compare the color of his/her eyes, tongue and palms with surrounding colors. if a child has inadequate haemoglobin (less red blood) or is suffering from anaemia (pale tongue, lips and palms), she/he requires to be treated with iron supplements. Routine dental check up involves observing the mouth, gums and teeth. Ask the child to open the mouth. Notice the smell (if there is foul smell, the child needs referral). Look for gums. Normal/swollen, red, pus etc. Observe arrangement of teeth. Look for teeth (glazed or unglazed /dull/ /color/ tarter deposits and stains. Look for cavities. 76 Visual Acuity and Color Vision examination: Importance: Procedure: l l l l Inference: For Testing Near Vision: Examination for hearing: Procedure: l l l l l Inference:Any child having visual defects mainly has problems related to color blindness (unable to see red or green) or night blindness. This will hamper the child's learning and performance. Visual acuity is measured. Each eye is examined separately . Color blindness can be assessed . Ask whether she/he can see properly . Child with normal vision must be able to read the seventh line easily (6/6). She/he must be able to distinguish colors. The chart is held at a distance of 40cm from the person and she is asked to read or identify the letter/symbols in ascending or descending order . The rest of the procedures are the same as for the distance vision examination. Importance: Normal hearing is absolutely essential for a child to be able to learn. Minor hearing problems if undetected will not only result in poor academic performance but risk the child in being labelled as abnormal in a variety of ways. Strike gently the tuning fork on the palm. When it produces vibration, take it near to the ear of the person. The child is asked if he/she can hear the sound produced by the vibrating fork. If he/she assures that he/she can hear, tell him/ her to speak. Stop as soon as the sound stops. Immediately put the tuning fork at the back of the ear and ask the same question. If he/she answers that he/she cannot hear the fork refer the child to an expert. 77 There are two formats given here regarding a format of Health Cards. The first one is in the form of a child's Health History which the school may take at the time of admission so that the School has a record of the child's Health status. This is merely suggestive. The second format is more general and needs to be periodically updated to keep a record of the continuous format Health status of the child through school. At no stage should the school consider any external Examination or referral without taking the parents into confidence. Establishing good health practices is essential but keeping the parents aware and informed and taking their consent and approval at every step is even more so. For each parent the health of the child is of paramount importance and their support will be assured.School Health Record SCHOOL HEAL TH RECORD Name: ........................

Cardiac arrest occurs in 70% of individuals at home and 20% at workplace and only in 10% at hospital. It is therefore important that non-healthcare persons such as schoolchildren, teachers, police and drivers should learn how to o save life and transport the patient to the nearest health facility . is a procedure to support and maintain breathing and circulation for a person who has stopped breathing (respiratory arrest) and/or whose heart has stopped (cardiac arrest). If one school kid is trained in CPR, he or she can take care of peers, family members and community at large. Beside CPR and foreign body removal, it also includes considerations of patient transport such as the protection of the cervical spine and avoiding additional injuries through splinting and immobilization. When witnessing sudden collapse in victims of all ages, the rescuer should first telephone the emergency medical services system and then return to continue CPR (phone first). But for unwitnessed arrest (eg drowning, drug overdose and injured), the rescuer should deliver five cycles of CPR before calling emergency number and then continue CPR (phone first). The highest survival rate from cardiac arrest can be achieved only when the following sequence of events occurs as rapidly as possible: 1.Early recognition of warning signs 2.Activation of emergency medical services 3.Basic CPR 4.Defibrillation 5.Management of airway and resuscitation (CPR) 84LEARN CPRLEARN CPR You Can Do It!You Can Do It!Figure 1: The chain of survival. The 4 links of actions in the chain are (1) phone (2) CPR, (3) early defibrillation and (4) advanced care These events have been likened to the links in a chain -The Chain of Survival. It was introduced in 1991 as a model of efficiency and synergy in resuscitative efforts. If any link is weak or missing, the chances of survival are lessened. The links in the Adult chain of survival are: 1.Early access 2.Early CPR 3.Early defibrillation 4.Early advanced cardiac life support Respiratory arrest is present when respiratory efforts are completely absent or inadequate to maintain effective oxygenation and ventilation. Respiratory arrest without cardiac arrest can result from a number of causes including submersion, near drowning, smoke inhalation, drug overdose, electrocution, suffocation. Immediately establish a patent airway and provide rescue breaths to prevent cardiac arrest and hypoxic injury to the brain and other organs. In cardiac arrest, circulation ceases and vital organs are deprived of oxygen. The victim will have no pulse and no signs of circulation. The victims of cardiac arrest need immediate CPR. For every minute without CPR, survival from sudden cardiac arrest decreases from 7 to 10%. When bystander CPR is provided, the decrease in survival is gradual and averages 3- 4% from collapse to arrival in hospital. Thus, CPR doubles or triples survival from sudden cardiac arrest. Non injured patient: shake the victim and shout \"Are you all right?\" Injured patient: Tap and talk The rescuer must determine if the scene is safe.Indications for BEC Steps of Basic Emergency Care v v v1.Respir atory Arrest 2.Cardiac Arrest Assess Responsiveness 85 Early AccessEarly CPREarly DefibrillationEarly Advanced Carev v vIf alone, shout for help. If no one responds, activate Emergency medical services (EMS). Then return to the victim and begin CPR. If the victim has sustained injuries to the head and neck or if injury is suspected, move the victim only if necessary . For resuscitation and evaluation to be effective, the victim must be on the back and on a firm, flat surface. If the victim is lying face down, roll the victim as a unit so that the head, shoulders and torso move simultaneously without twisting (\" log roll\" the victim). If a rescuer finds an unresponsive victim, he should activate the Emergency Medical Services such as ambulance services by calling local ambulance number . After providing the necessary information about the location and condition of the victim, return to provide CPR . This method of CPR was recommended by the AHA in an Advisory Statement (March 31, 2008). It is intended for bystanders untrained in standard CPR, who see an adult suddenly collapse. It is also recommended for situations when the rescuer is unable or unwilling to provide mouth-to-mouth ventilations. 1. CALL Check the victim for unresponsiveness. If there is no response, Call ambulance and return to the victim. 2. PUMP If the victim is still not breathing normally , coughing, or moving, begin chest compressions. Push down on the center of the chest 1 1/2 to 2 inches and keep doing it. Pump at the rate of 100/minute, faster than once per second. Position of the Victim Activate Emergency Medical System (EMS) CPR in two simple steps - Hands-only CPRWhom to call for help? 86 Continue Until Help Arrives CPR FOR CHILDREN (AGES 1-8) SPECIAL RESUSCIT ATION SITUA TIONSCPR for children is similar to CPR for adults. The compression to ventilation ratio is 30:2. There are, however , 3 differences. 1)If you are alone with the child give two minutes of CPR before calling ambulance. 2)Use the heel of one or two hands for chest compression 3)Press the sternum approximately one-third the depth of the chest 1.Drowning Rescuer should provide CPR; particularly rescue breathing, as soon as an unresponsive submersion victim is removed from the water . When rescuing a drowning victim of any age, the lone rescuer should give five cycles (about two minutes) of CPR before leaving the victim to activate the EMS. Mouth-to-mouth ventilation in the water may be helpful when administered by a trained rescuer . The rescuer should remove drowning victims from the water by the fastest means available and should begin resuscitation as quickly as possible. Only victims with obvious clinical signs of trauma or alcohol intoxication or a history of diving, waterslide use or injured should be treated as a \"potential spinal cord injured,\" with stabilization and possible immobilization of the cervical and thoracic spine. 2.Hypothermia Hypothermia is a condition in which core temperature drops below that required for normal metabolism and body functions. In an unresponsive victim with hypothermia, assess breathing to confirm respiratory arrest and assess the pulse to confirm cardiac arrest. If the victim is not breathing, initiate rescue breathing immediately . If the victim does not have signs of circulation, begin chest compressions immediately . Do not wait until the victim is rewarmed to start CPR. Remove wet clothes, insulate or shield the victim, ventilate the victim with warm, humidified oxygen. Avoid rough movement; transport the victim to a hospital as soon as possible. For the hypothermic patient in cardiac arrest, continue resuscitative efforts until the patient is evaluated by advanced care providers. In the out-of-hospital setting, passive warming should be continued until active warming is available. 87 3. Electrocution Immediately switch off the main electric output .Evaluate and perform the steps of CPR. To be successful, CPR should be started as soon as a victim collapses. CPR quality is addressed by stressing good CPR-\"push hard, push fast\", allow full chest recoil after each compression and minimize interruptions in chest compressions. We rely on trained and willing public to initiate CPR, call for professional help and an AED. When these steps happen in a timely manner , CPR makes a difference.v v v v vWhat have we learned about CPR ? 88Epilepsy What should be done during the fit ?Epilepsy is a neurological disorder ( and NOT a mental illness). It Occurs due to sudden burst of abnormal electrical discharges from the brain . In a great majority of patients one does not know the cause for this condition. The medical science is yet to find a cause to many common diseases like high BP, diabetes and so also epilepsy . Epilepsy is a fairly common condition affecting nearly 1-3% of the population which means in our country with one billion population there are at least 10 million patients. The only problem is that no one wants to talk about their illness with the result every one thinks that he/she is the only unfortunate victim. Convulsions/fits are involuntary to and fro movements (tonic clonic) movements of limbs associated with loss of consciousness. Several situations can cause convulsions e.g. patients with kidney failure, liver failure, alcohol intoxication, brain haemorrhage - all these are not epilepsy . These are the manifestation of an underlying disorder . In epilepsy there is no such obvious illness and the person is active and normal in-between the attacks of seizures. Persons who have head trauma due to a road traffic accident could also have seizures. Keep calm. Loosen tight clothes around his/her neck - tie, tight collar , remove the spectacles. Prevent the patient from injuring himself. Put him/her in a safe place away from glass, machinery , staircase, stones etc. Turn the patient to a side and wipe the froth from his mouth . Try to find out if the patient is carrying an ID card with name telephone and doctors contact. Contact that person only when above are done. Some medicines can be used in emergency . They should be given if clear instructions for there use are given. Rush the person to hospital if the fit does not stop in 5 minutes. This may be status epilepticus. Do not insert spoon, cloth or any such articles into the mouth. Do not restrict convulsive movements as it may cause fracture. Do not crowd around the patient. Do not give water/tablets or stuff any other liquid in mouth till he is fully conscious.Do's Don'tsv v v v v v v v v v v 8990MYTHS & FACTS about epilepsy Myths Facts Epilepsy is because of possession by evil spirit and hence sorcery is the treatmentEpilepsy is a neurological disorder and there are medications to treat it effectively People with epilepsy are possessed by God and hence should be worshiped.Epilepsy is due to transient electrical disturbances in the brain and the individual should be treated like any other person. Epilepsy is a mental illness NO, it is a disease of the brain Epilepsy is contagious so one should not come in contact with a person with epilepsy .Certainly it is not contagious. Epileptic attacks damage the brain It is the damaged brain which can cause epilepsy . However a motor fit lasting for more than 5 minutes should be treated as an emergency . People with epilepsy are below normal in their intelligence.Epilepsy does not affect intelligence or memory . If the attacks are frequent or the person is taking large doses of antiepileptic drugs, this may affect temporarily the memory . Epilepsy is hereditary and so one should not marry .Epilepsy is not a hereditary disease. The tendency to get epilepsy is passed on in about 3 % only. Hence epilepsy is no bar for marriage. Marriage cures epilepsy ? OFF COURSE NOT. MEDICINES DO Epilepsy is life long disorder Not at all. In about 75% of people with epilepsy ,the seizures are well controlled and a great majority of them can go off the drugs. Epilepsy is rare Epilepsy affects almost 1% of population all over the world. Seizure can be stopped by giving a key in the hand or making a person to smell onionFalse. The attack stops on its own and not due to the above factors. No need to insert any object in the mouth. In fact this may cause damage to the teeth or gums or the object may block the breathing pipe.During an attack to prevent swallowing of tongue one has to insert a spoon in the mouth. Though it is common in children, epilepsy can occur at any age. In fact a second peak of incidence occurs between the age of 60-70 years.Epilepsy occurs only in children91Dogs Bites and How to Avoid Them Did You Know that ... v v v v v vAccording to a recent WHO report, over 20,000 people die in a year in India due to rabies, making it the highest rabies deaths in the world? Children account for some 50% of these deaths? Over 95% of rabies deaths in India are due to rabid dog bite? Most dog bites affecting young children occur during everyday activities? Senior citizens are the second most common dog bite victims? Awareness is the key to avoid dog bites? However , the good news is that there are a number of things that we can do to avoid dog bites. How to Avoid Dog Bites v v v vNever disturb a dog that is eating, sleeping or is caring for puppies. Dogs may bite if startled or frightened. Do not throw sticks or stones at a dog. Do not approach a dog that is tied. Respect a dog's space. Keep your hands away from a dog's fence. A dog considers its yard as personal property and may growl or bite to protect it.v v v vIn case of pet dogs, always take permission from the dog owner before approaching their dog. Be cautious around a mother dog and her puppies. In order to protect her puppies, the mother dog may bite Do not run or move quickly near dogs. Do not turn back and run. 92v v v v vDo not look a dog in the eyes. Speak softly and gently to calm the dog. Say something like \"good dog, Its OK\". Do not yell or make loud noises. If a nervous dog gets close to you, FREEZE and pretend to be a tree. Allow the dog to sniff and it will usually go away. If a dog attacks, assume the position of a rock. Curl into a ball and protect your face, neck and head. Keep your dog and those in the neighborhood healthy and happy by vaccinating them against Rabies. Consult an animal welfare NGO or a veterinarian to know more about the Anti-Rabies Vaccinations.Anti-Rabies V accination: Dog Bite Emergencies What should be done immediately after a dog bite? Animal Birth Control (ABC)Most people associate all dog bites with rabies infection. But that's not so. Only a bite from a dog that is infected or carrying the rabies virus is dangerous. But Rabies is always fatal to humans if not treated. Hence, suitable steps have to be taken to prevent the possibility of infections. Clean bite wound with soap and warm water as soon as possible. Be sure to rinse all the soap away , or it will cause irritation later. Always show it to a physician. Some dog bites need antibiotics, particularly if they are deep puncture wounds. Pour a generous amount of any antiseptic solution into the dog bite wounds. This solution would disinfect the wound site. Isolate the dog and monitor it. It's important to determine if a dog has received its rabies vaccination. Request the dog's owner for proof of rabies vaccination. Overpopulation of dogs and cats could contribute to rabies outbreaks. Consult an animal welfare NGO or a veterinarian about ABC to prevent unwanted puppies and kittens. Animal Birth Control also keeps them healthier and better behaved.v v v v v v v 93First Aid v v v v v v v v v v v v v v v v v v v v v v v v v v v vObjectives: Providing First Aid Making a First Aid Kit:to restore and maintain vital functions.

Improving the student's ability to establish and maintain relationship helps in improving the quality of relationship with others. Many students have problems relating to other people probably due to poor self image causing him/her to act defensively in relationship or it may be seen as the result of inadequate social skills. Therefore, a counselor helps the student develop and maintain healthy relationship with others. Enhancing Coping Skills is another dynamic of counseling. For a variety of environmental, biological and psychological reasons children may find it difficult to cope with adversities or challenges of everyday life. E.g. examination , peer pressure, failures , emotional setbacks , traumas etc. The student may exhibit physical and psychological problems like frequent headaches, inability to sleep etc. Counselor works with the student to develop healthy coping skills. Promotion of Decision making helps individual obtain information, clarity and sort out personal characteristics and emotional concerns that may interfere with or be related to making decisions. It helps these individuals to acquire an understanding of not only their abilities, interests and opportunities but also of the emotions and attitudes that can influence their choices and decisions. Facilitating student potential can be viewed as a goal towards improving personal effectiveness. Counseling seeks to maximize an individual's freedom within the limitations imposed by his own self and his environment. Students might seek advice from various sources , like their parents, teachers, friends, and so on. But ,a counselor had inculcated specific skills as professional. A few of them are: Non-judgmental, non-critical, avoids prejudices, and presumptions Curiosity and inquisitiveness: Posses a natural interest in people An ability to listen: Find listening stimulating A comfort with conversation : Enjoy verbal exchanges Empathy and understanding: Can put themselves in another person's place Emotional insightfulness: Are comfortable dealing with a wide range of feelings Introspection: Have the ability to see/feel themselves from withinSkills of a School Counselor106The purpose of the section is to provide background information for the trainer / teacher . It describes the basic principles and practices of organizing and implementing training course and is common to all the activities. The trainers / teachers are suggested to have a group of 45-50 participants/students for each activity. The activities are suitable for Life Skills enhancement of school going children. At the beginning of any activity with a new group of people it is necessary to spend some time on helping that group to begin to develop its own identity - its \"Life\" . This can be done by the trainer taking participants through a series of activities given below . Activities known as the ice breakers are used at the beginning of an activity as part of the climate building process and to help participants get to know each other . Several activities are specifically designed to enable group members to get to know each other's names. The purpose of an energizer is to allow participants to get a 'feel' of the activity - if the energy levels are low - after a meal break for example - then a physical activity can help to lend some motivation to a group. Alternatively , some activities can serve the opposite purpose - to calm down the atmosphere after a difficult period or heated debate. Some energizers can also be used as strategies for dividing participants into small groups. All the activities described here belong to the low risk category . This means that they should not cause any group member undue embarrassment, stress or discomfort by requiring them to reveal too much of a personal nature. Invite the participants to sit in a circle and place a large piece of flipchart paper in the centre of the circle. Ask each participant, in turn to sign their name on the paper , and to make a brief statement about their name. Ask participants to conduct a round, which you initiate e.g., Reasons why I can't come to school today . The reasons for not Ice Breakers Ice Breaking Activities 1.Name Graffiti : 2.Reasons Why I Can't Come to School Today? 6. Guidelines for Facilitators / Teachers / Peer Educators6. Guidelines for Facilitators / Teachers / Peer Educators107attending school must begin with the same letter of the alphabet as the person's name, e.g., My name is Shilpa and I can't come to school today because I am sick. Ask the participants to stand up to pick a partner . Encourage them to find someone who they don't know very well and not to wait until they are picked, but to be proactive about choosing. When the partnerships have been formed , ask them to sit down together and then spend one minute to find one thing that they have in common. After the minute is up, ask them to stay with their partner and to find another couple, thus making a foursome and to find one thing in common. The task is then repeated, this time with the foursomes making groups of eight. Ask each group to disclose their commonality at the end of exercise. The purpose of this activity is to find all the people in the room who fit a particular description. Ask the participants to stand up and to move around the room, identifying others who fit a range of categories, which you describe. The following are suggestions: All those who share the same birthday month... All those who share the same birth sign... All those who share birth in same part of the country ... All those who share the same favourite food... All those who share the same favourite holiday place... Ask the participants to sit in a circle and start off by introducing yourself. The person on your left should then give your name, e.g..... and I am ... and then the next person gives the first two followed by their name e.g.... And I am.... and then the next person gives the first two followed by their own name and so on around the circle, each person adding their name to the Human Scavenger Hunt Give the participants a Human Scavenger Hunt Handout that you have prepared in advance (see sample list below). It should include at least 10 Instructions 108statements about things people may have done or experienced in their lives. Ask them to roam around the room and find as many other participants as possible to whom the listed things apply; they should write each person' s name on the line next to something that applies to him or her. After 10 minutes, ask the participants to sit down again. Ask participants of introduce themselves in turn, mentioning the listed item for which they found the most participants, and share interesting things they learned about another member of the group. has an older sister _______________________________ ________________________ has not watched TV in the last month_______________________________ _________ has a birthday in the same month as you__________________________________ wants to be older _______________________________________________________ takes a bus to school _____________________________________________________ has more than six siblings_ ________________________________________________ is learning another language ______________________________________________ was born in another city or village _________________________________________ has a grandparent living at home_ __________________________________________ has planted a tree _______________________________________________________ is the youngest child in his/her family ______________________________________ recently read a good book ________________________________________________ knows how to ride a bicycle _______________________________________________ has travelled to another city or province ____________________________________ Human Scavenger Hunt Find Someone Who : : Energizing Activities 1.

Ask the participant to sit in a circle and ask the trainer to stand in the middle. Ask all the participants to move places \"if...Shout out an instruction, for example, \"change places if you are wearing trousers...wearing spectacles...have long hair...etc. While the participants are changing places, move to find a chair for yourself, which means that someone else will be in the middle and will have to find a chair. Continue until everyone is tired. If participants are asked to form small groups of their choice, they may often choose to work with friends and group cohesion may come in the way of serious work. You can ensure that this does not happen by using some of the following activities: Count participants off in twos....... Line up participants according to birth month, initials, signs of the zodiac etc... Line up participants to find someone who, e.g., has the same height or clothes... Ask participants to choose a partner or to work with someone they have not worked with before... Distribute cards at random, which are to be matched up in order to find a partner , e.g, famous couples, matching shapes, letters, or cut up old greeting cards and ask participants to find the piece that completes the pictures... Ask the participants to move around the room until you call out the number you want in a group... It is often difficult to make an accurate assessment of how long different groups will take to complete a group activity - there will always be quick learners! You may have to issue quite a lot of encouraging statements to hurry along 110the slower groups, and offer time limits, e.g., one minute left. Taking feedback from a larger number of groups can be a time consuming exercise. However , it is important to acknowledge the contribution to the activity made by all the groups. You can cut down on time by: Asking written feedback (usually on larger posters of paper) to be displayed around the room and for all the participants to look at each other's efforts. Making sure that, after the first group's feedback, subsequent groups only add issues and comments, which haven't been raised previously . Ground rules are the operational guidelines for the participants' and the trainer's behaviour during the activity and encourage co-operation and collaboration, and contribute towards the learning climate. Explain the rationale for establishing ground rules to the group. Display a list of pre-prepared ground rules on the board/OHP and ask for comments and clarification. Ask participants to add to the list. The following is a list of suggestions for Ground Rules. Be punctual Listen Tolerate Respect each other's views No sarcasm Be positive No negative comments to individuals The participants need to know that you, as trainers, have the power to make decisions about when a discussion has lost immediate relevance and the time has come to move on. They also need to be reassured that you will be available to deal with any individual issues of concern. Use open-ended questions. Use positive language and statements and then ask participants for their contribution Value all the contributions you receive from the participants. Be willing to quote your own opinions if you are asked and to offer personal self- disclosure if necessary . Admit any mistakes you make.l l Setting ground rules : Strategies for Establishing Ground Rules : \u00d8 \u00d8\u00d8 \u00d8 \u00d8\u00d8 \u00d8 \u00d8 Conducting the Activities : P P P P111P P P P P Finishing An Activity Conducting Empowerment sessions by Peers Co-peer Educator Daily Debriefing QuestionsAllow the participants to have time to reflect. Ensure that you make eye contact with the people that you talk to and use their names. Be ready to challenge a view presented by a participant if you feel it is appropriate. Intervene in a firm, yet sensitive fashion, if a discussion is being taken over by one or two powerful personalities or is losing its way. Think about how and when to intervene during a group activity . It is very important to set time limits. Some of the questions given below can be used for processing and winding up an activity: WHAT? - How did I feel about this, what did I learn about my own behavior? SO WHAT? How can I implement this learning in other areas of my life? It is always more useful to initiate peer educators (preferably in pairs) to peer teach other students. They can come together to develop skills through activities suggested in the other Manuals. They can use the following set of debriefing questions to focus on better empowerment skills. To improve presentations during a Peer Educator to-peer session, one can discuss the following questions during daily debriefing sessions at the end of each day. 1. How well did we meet the goals of our workshop sessions today? 2. What did we do today that was not effective? 3. What did we do today that was effective? 4. How well did we handle problems that arose during the workshop today? 5. How well are we working together as co-trainers? Is there anything that we need to improve? 6. Is there any feedback we would like for the session the next day?112The Experiential Learning Cycle In A Workshop Direct experience / Other peers discuss: Reflection: thoughts/feelings Gener alization: Lessons Learned (exercise or activity) (Trainer / P eer Educator introduces the activity and explains how to do it) Trainees / Other peers participate in : brainstorming role-play small-group discussion story-telling case study games drawing pictures next steps (Trainer / P eer Educator gives suggestions) how the knowledge can be useful in their lives how to overcome difficulties in using knowledge plan follow-up to use the knowledge story-telling case study games drawing pictures (Trainer / P eer Edcucator guides discussion) Trainee / Other peers answer questions share reactions to activity identify key results Trainer / P eer Edcucator gives information; draws out similarities and differences, summarizes) Trainees Other peers participate in: presenting their exercise results summarizing key points drawing general conclusions Evaluation can also be conducted on a verbal level as part of the closing activ ity.

Here's what to look for: The playground should be surrounded by fences to prevent younger children from wandering in and out and to allow the area to be closed off when no supervisor is present. Fences also insure that the equipment will only be approached from the proper direction. The equipment should be arranged according to the age group for which it is intended. Facilities for younger children should be separated from facilities for older children. This will keep the younger child away from equipment that requires a strength and skill he/she doesn't yet have and will protect him/her from being caught up in the more vigorous, potentially dangerous, activities of older kids. Adequate space should be marked off for each activity to protect both the participants and the passers by Boundaries must be clearly indicated by physical barriers or painted lines. Make sure your child understands the importance of staying outside them when he/she's not actively playing. Particularly around equipment, the surface of the playground should consist of relatively soft materials such as grass, earth, sand or tanbark. Concrete, asphalt and other hard, unyielding surfaces greatly increase the chances of serious injury . Check that the surface is given the necessary maintenance to keep it safe. Make sure the playground is kept clear of broken glass, bottles, metal tabs from cans and other debris, especially around slides, sand boxes and swings. Broken-down, dilapidated structures are obviously dangerous and should never be used. However , every piece of equipment used in the playground must be examined to make sure it is safe for your child's play. The equipment must be firmly anchored into the ground. In most public playgrounds, the apparatus is safely embedded in concrete. Backyard equipment anchored with pegs must be checked regularly to make sure that they haven't worked their way loose. All anchoring devices should be buried well below ground where they won't be tripped over. Check that the equipment hasn't shifted with use. Structural components designed to be horizontal or vertical must be maintained that way. Shifts in position can impose a strain on the structure which may eventually lead to its breaking or collapsing.v v v v v v vPlay Ground Safety128v v v v vScrews and bolts holding the equipment together must not be loose or missing. Exposed screws and bolts should fit flush or be capped and any protruding parts covered with tape. Fittings must be examined frequently to make sure they remain securely in place. Split-link chains, S-hooks and similar fittings separate easily and are extremely dangerous. Hanging rings should either be much smaller than a child's head or much larger , under 5 inches (12.7 cm) or over 10 inches (4.4 cm.). Metal structures should be kept free form rust. Wooden equipment should be protected against deterioration and restored or replaced as required Check for splinters.129Functions of Assessment Assessment and Evaluation Teaching: Communication: Assessed? Who Should Assess? Too much focus on rather than on the understanding and application skills inherent in the course of study should be avoided. Stress must be placed on acquiring health skills for entire life. However the following are purposes for which assessment may be considered. Students and teachers may gain greater understanding of the substance of the program when the results of test and assignments are reported to them. Students tend to organise their study around the demands of assignments and assessment requirements. Thus assessment helps them to understand the objectives of the course and the standards expected. To determine whether a student has achieved a satisfactory standard or may count the course towards some level of award. Assessment can provide the student with information on personal level of attainment and the teacher with indication of success and suitability of methods, resources and effectiveness of teaching. Allow students to clarify and refine their understanding of attitudes and values of themselves and others. To demonstrate whether a student has attained the necessary practical skills required in a particular area. The readiness of the student to proceed to the next unit of word or course may be determined by appropriate assessment procedures. When considering the evaluation necessary it is important to consider the need in varying circumstances to assess all students, selection groups, individual students, the teaching, the course, organisation and administration. At varying times, students should be encouraged to self-assess, groups of students may undertake peer assessment. The whole class may assess a piece of work, the teacher may assess in varying ways a teacher from another group.7. Assessment and Evaluation 7. Assessment and Evaluation130 Frequency of Assessment ExaminationsAssessment may profitably occur in varying ways as process assessment during the course of the program or as outcome evaluation at the completion, at the end or during each lesson, during a workshop or tutorial, at the end of a unit of work, at the end of each term, at the conclusion of the year's work at graduation. Examinations in this syllabus are required and are to be used in assessment of progress. Care should be taken in development of examination papers to ensure that there is an array of question types (as indicated as follows) and that the examinations are valid in that they test the subject matter taught but also allow for some deductive reasoning in solving problems posed. Furth er, as the health work covered is very practical in nature, at least 30% of marks should be allocated for practical work carried out in the home, school or community . This may be done as a project task undertaken by an individual or small group in which a final report is written by each student, individually covering: 1. Clear statement of the problem; 2. Aims of the project; 3. Methods undertaken to achieve aims; 4. Problems which were encountered; 5. Conclusion. 131Sources of Evidence Indicators of ImpactWhen considering objectives which encompass health knowledge, attitudes and skills, assessment procedures must include a variety of approaches, including; - individual as well as group assignments and reports - essays, children's writing - observation and analysis of behaviour , in classroom, school, community - records of staff meetings - changes in maintenance of school facilities - critical incidents, reports, journals, diaries, reports - judgement against standards - interviews, discussions, meetings, surveys, reports from parents - restricted response questionnaires, rating scales - free response questionnaires, interviews, feedback sheets - teachers' subjective judgement - already available information may be varied in a course involving health and living skills. They may include: - improvement in personal hygiene, - better home sanitation, - improvement in institutional health and hygiene practices, - evidence of better , cleaner maintenance of school toilets, - increase in confidence, - greater flexibility , - increased care for the well-being of the other , - increase in ability to cope with problems and difficulties, - increase in decision -making opportunities and responsibilities, -improvement in communication, research, oral/written work, presentation, - improved responses to quizzes, tests, examinations on knowledge, - practical ability improved in health situations, - accepting and respecting each other's opinions, - increase in team-work and group decision-making, - challenge in stereotype and prejudice, - easy reorganisation of classroom for active, participatory teaching/learning, - more experiential, practical teaching/learning strategies, - reduction in incidents of transferable disease,132- low morbidity , - better immunisation cover , - less home, school, street, recreation and workplace accidents, - better cooking and food preservation practices, - decrease in corporal punishment, abuse and exploitation, - greater rewarding and appreciation of children, - better communication between home and school, - more responsibility and decision-making opportunities for students, - equal treatment for all children, for boys and girls, for children with special needs. should thus be one means of seeking a better learning and teaching environment and thus improved personal and group health. Tests are often used to evaluate knowledge, which may be a starting point for change in thinking, attitudes and behaviour . It is difficult to devise valid, reliable tests and it is often desirable to use a variety of types.

It is a means to reach out to the community by the school and an opportunity to present the school as a caring educational institution which is very much part of the community it serves. Health exhibition is a school-level event involving all stakeholders-children, teachers, health functionaries and the community . It gives the parents and community an opportunity to know more about their own health and their well being of their children. Health check ups by renowned and super-specialist hospitals. Display of Ayurvedic, homeopathy , naturopathy system of medicine, medicinal plants and organic products prepared by Home Science students. Lectures by eminent expert and clinicians on concepts and applications of dimensions of health and awareness regarding adolescence concerns. Inter-school Competitions to create awareness regarding health. Exhibitions and sale of books and publications, food supplements and eco-friendly products, fitness products and knowledge regarding health insurance. A Primary Health Unit, adulteration tests and experiments conducted under DNA club presented by science students. Preparation was the key to successfully organizing and conducting the health exhibition. Preparation, discussions and meetings were started in the beginning of the academic year. The health exhibition was named as NIROG DHAM. The date for conducting the exhibition was decided well in advance and was incorporated in the school calendar . Pamphlets and advertisements were designed to attract the health agencies to participate the exhibition.v v v v v-A Case Study1391.The Hospitals and other healthcare institutes were contacted and were asked to participate in the exhibition. The Different indicators of health were taken by each hospital to impart different health check-ups. 2.The Home Science faculty was responsible to collect the recipes of different organic product of amla like chutney , murabba, candy and supari. The Home Science students prepared different products under the supervision of Home Science teachers. 3.The super specialist doctors of different fields were approached to give review regarding various health concerning problems. Expressions India also took keen interest in conducting work shops on Parent Advocacy and different Adolescence issues. 4.The school librarian contacted different publishers to display magazines, books and other material related to healthcare in the exhibition. 5.The Science faculty was responsible for training the students to handle different medical emergencies. The different science models and displays were prepared by the children under the supervision of science teachers. The DNA club presentation also showcased different activities, field trips and experiments conducted through out the academic year. One could hardly recognize the school on the D-day . With more than 2000 people gathered, the entire school building was converted into a health catering institute, as the name symbolized NIROG DHAM. The school ground was covered with bright shamiana, numerous colorfully dressed people; the atmosphere was no less than that during a village jathre (fair) bustling with activity . The hustle and bustle began at around 9\"00 a.m. The class rooms were nicely decked up with bright canopies. Each classroom had two stalls. On the whole 36 health catering institutes participated in the health exhibition. 12 organizations were for check-ups, 8 organizations were for Ayurveda, naturopathy and homeopathy consultancy , 4 organizations for books and publishers, 2 for medical insurance and 1 for medicinal plants. At the entrance was a registration desk where children noted the names of visitors. Here each visitor was handed a printed list of institutions participating and feedback form to indicate the grade obtained by him/her after visiting each of the stall.The Process: On the Health Exhibition Day:140People gathered in large numbers around each stalls and it was amazing to observe the children working as a team. The children were totally in charge of the stalls and hence communicated freely and made independent decisions. Word of mouth was a strong force in drawing people to the exhibition. P eople who first came and visited the exhibition must have gone back home and told their friends and neighbours that this was an event not to be missed. The expenses of the exhibition were minimal especially considering the wide spread participation of the people. Care was taken to minimize expenses by using in-house expenses. Props and the decorating material- to decorate the entire school building were prepared by art & craft faculty . The infrastructure i.e. chairs, beds (PHC), bulletin boards, display boards were all in house. Banners and the instructional material were prepared by the teachers. Food was in issue that was discussed at length. Ultimately it was decided that two times tea/coffee from vending machine should be served to the participants while the doctors who came for the health check ups could be served with lunch. The cost of shamianas was saved as the entire event was held in the building. However the competition were held in the playground, hence required few shamianas. The table below gives detail of the approximate expenditure towards organizing the exhibition.Budget: Expenditure for Health Exhibition (Approx) S.No. Items Amount (Rs.) Remarks 1.

The Students, T eachers and the Parents were made aware regarding the different alternative medicines. The products prepared by Home Science students were appreciated to a great extent. The event provided a space for children to act independently with immense self confidence, as the students projected their models & displays. The Primary Health Centre Unit involved a lot of group dynamics. Lectures by eminent experts helped the students and community to gain insight regarding childhood related problems like diabetes, Asthma and different adolescence concerns like HIV/AIDS, substance abuse etc. Sale & Display on books inspired the students and parents to be aware about health education and the latest finding in this stream.Appendix-3 142ActivitiesPlan of the Year - Medical 2009-2010 Month April May July August September October November December January February MarchDate 6th, 7th, & 8th 22nd 9th (on PTM) 13th, 8th 11th, 20th 1st to 7th 22nd 10th (Open Day) 10th & 11th 1st 13th 16thImportant Days World Healthy Day (7th) World Earth Day (22nd) World Asthma Day (3rd) No Tobacco Day (31st) World P opulatin Day (11th) Dengue P revention Day (10th) World Mosquito Day (20th) World Nutrition W eek (1st to 7th) World Alzheimer's Day (21st) World Sight Day (12th) World Diabetic Day (14th) World AIDS Day (1st) Laughter Day (13th) -No Smoking Day (13th)Tentative Plan -Healthy Tiffin Competition for o Montessori o Primary -Yoga & Meditation o Middle o Senior -Presentation on Global Warming o Primary oSenior -Health Talk on Asthma for parents -Inter-house quiz Competition -Skit -Banner/Rally-On Cleanliness -Inspection by the Students -Quiz with W ellness Club -Self made Nutritious recipe competition/ -Talk by the class XI Home science students on nutrition related issues -Question Answer Session -Eye Check up by V enu Eye Institute -Blood Sugar Check Up for Obese and Children having Family History of Diabetes -Red Ribbon Distribution for Senior Student -Jokes session by class XI students in the assembly -Poster Making CompetitionDetails -To be coordinated by primary wing -Art of Living/P hysical Education Department -Power point presentation by Medical Faculty -By expert/School Doctor -Students to be given literature before hand to prepare -Skit in the assembly to be coordinated by Music/Dance Faculty -To be prepare by the students of Class VII & IX -Criteria to be provided by the Medical faculty -Selection Criteria by the medical, counseling & home science faculty -In the assembly -For Staff, Students & Parents -Criteria Medical R ecords -To be distributed to the students of class XI & XII in their respective classes -To be coordinated by senior teachers -For classes VI to IXAppendix-4 143STUDENT'S MEDICAL RECORD (To be filled by the parent on the first day of the session) 1.Specific ailments suffered in the past: __________________________________________________________________ 2.Operations undergone in 3.Allergies, if any: __________________________________________________________________ 4.Is the If so, give details: __________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________ 1.A student who has been sick should bring a medical & fitness certificate from the doctor on rejoining the school after illness. 2.The parents should fill in the reason for the absence of the child from the school in the 'Record of Absence\" given in the Almanac or fill the Leave Application From available at the reception. 3.Students suffering from the following disease must observe the prescribed period of quarantine before returning to the school :-Leave /Absence (on medical grounds) (a) Conjunctivitis Till full recovery (b) Measles Two weeks after the rash disappears (c) Mumps 7 to 10 days after the swelling subsides (d) Chicken P ox Two weeks after the onset of lesions (e) Jaundice Six weeks after recoveryAppendix-5 144Experience Sharing By The Peer Trainers Our Future PlansInitial Impressions What we learnt What we did about itv v v v v v v v v v v v v v v v vWe got the chance to meet students from various schools and realized that they were not much different from us. i.e. they had similar interests, queries etc. chance to meet students from various schools and realized that they were not much different from us. i.e. they had similar interests, queries etc. We got a platform to voice our opinions and felt that sharing our thoughts was easier in this group. Rather , a variety of opinion was encouraged. We learnt that the issues, which bothered us, were actually important and needed appropriate handling. Concepts of Life Skills were introduced, which appeared timeless and ageless. The workshop on Anger and stress helped to understand how different people react to same situation differently . Learnt more about deadly disease (AIDS/HIV), its diagnosis and prevention. At an age when many of us differ in opinions with our family , we learnt the various effective ways to cope up with situations in the workshop on Family Relations and Bonding. During the session in our school, we got a chance to know our peers better though they have studied with us for many years. We conducted the workshop on 'Introduction to Life Skills' in our school It was conducted on the basis of the initiation session. We divided the students in to 10 groups and gave each of them a thought provoking task based on different life skills. For example, Creative Thinking - Forming a unique prefectorial board; Coping with stress and emotions - Role play on dealing with a bully. Each group was asked to make a presentation; followed by a group discussion. Finally the significance of life skills was discussed and feedback taken. We plan to conduct these workshops for classes IX to XII and form a rapport of being friendly peers. With the help of our counselor want to develop a Peer Mentor Club so that no needy student suffers silently and has someone to share and discuss. We, the Peer Trainers and our Counsellor , thank the team of EXPRESSIONS and especially Dr. Jitendra Nagpal for this learning experience.

ACAD/EO/2006 Dated : 31.5.2006 Circular No. 09 All the Heads of the institutions affiliated to CBSE. Subject: Comprehensive School Health Programme and Creating Health Club in the school. Dear Principal, Childhood and adolescence form the most joyful period of an individual's life. They are times of immense creative energy, self-discovery and exploration of the world. They can also be fraught with feelings of isolation, loneliness and confusion. They can be due to various factors relating to the physical, social, emotional, mental and spiritual well being of the younger generation. Schools, families and communities need to play a positive and responsible role in bringing up young children in a healthy environment which would enable each one to maximize their potential. Schools can provide dynamic settings for promoting health, for enabling children to grow and mature into healthy adults. Yet the potential of the school to enhance health is often underutilized. 'Sc hool Health' has largely remained confined to medical check-ups of children or some hours of health instruction in the curriculum. There is a growing recognition that the health and psycho-social wel l- being of children and youth is of fundamental value and the schools can provide a strategic means of improving children's health, self-esteem, life skills and behaviour. Although schools have undertake n many initiatives in promoting school health, the comprehensiveness and sustainability in these initi a- tives is not clearly laid out. The need of the hour is a comprehensive school health policy integra ted within the school system. The Central Board of Secondary Education suggests that schools plan out a Comprehensive School Health Programme which could be initiated through HEALTH CLUB in each school to begin with. Need For Creating Health Clubs in Schools Healthy living incase of school children is the prime concern of all stakeholders including principa ls, parents, teachers and the community. To achieve this objective collective responsibility needs to b e assumed. An important dimension is that of experience and development of health skills and phy- sique through practical engagements with play, exercises, sports and practices of personal and com- munity hygiene. Health and Wellness Clubs in Schools would focus on the overall well being comprising emotional, soc ial and mental health of the child. It would act as the enabling and organizational point for conductin g activities related to various dimensions of health and wellness. A Health Card needs to be created for students which would form a continuous part of their growth and development. This could form an effective monitoring and feedback system for the overall health of a child during his schooling. ...................../- - 2 - 146Constitution of a Health Club Principal as Convener Counselor / Psychologist / P . T Teacher / Nodal Teacher as Secretary Student representative (one boy and one girl from each level) Identified teachers from each level Parent for each level (preferably a doctor) Responsibilities of the Health Club As an organizer of all health relevant activities (at least 8-10 activities in the year at each level). As a Resource Centre for the overall well being of students Objectives of the Health Club To create Health Cards for each student To create a health newspaper at least twice a year/poster competition related to health issues To conduct surveys on health related concerns To organize 'health walks' as part of social campaigns To organize health fairs and immunization projects To tap the local resources in the community to arrange health talks To render service in any area affected by a disaster or a calamity To create health help line within the school to distress, cope with emotional and social behaviour and to clarify misconceptions regarding sexual and reproductive health To teach the students techniques of yoga and meditation from an early age To inculcate in the students healthy and positive ways of living To teach health songs on various health topics Celebration of important days (World Health Day - April 7) Creating awareness regarding 'World No Tobacco Day' (May 31), 'World AIDS Day' (December 1) etc. The Board is suggesting a plethora of activities in Annexure A for various levels which can be conducted as part of co-curricular inputs during the calendar year.

Subject : Importance of Nutrition for Bone Health. Dear Principal, Bone Health is a neglected area and has resulted in various problems both for adults and young children. The major causes for the poor bone health in India are genetic predisposition, lower bone mineral density due to deficiency of calcium and vitamin D, inadequate exposure of body surface area to direct sunshine even though the country has plenty of sunshine throughout the year, clothing pattern , relatively pigmented skin, poor diet, lack of availability of foods fortified with essential vitamin s and minerals and lack of physical activity. Childhood and adolescence is the time when bones are beginning to be modeled until around the age of 30 when peak bone mass is achieved. Diet in the modeling phase is extremely important. A critical element that helps absorb deposition of dietary calcium into bone mass is vitamin D. Defi- ciency of vitamin D is one of major contributory factor responsible for lower bone mineral density (BMD). A related bone problem is flurosis. It is prevalent in 17 States and has affected 66 million people including about 6 million children below the age of 14. It results from consuming ground water with excessive fluoride leading to bone disorders. Inadequate exposure of body surface area to direct sunshine, clothing pattern, relatively pigmented skin, environmental pollution, faulty housing archi - tecture which does not allow enough sunshine, poor diet and lack of required food fortification, are among the major factors responsible for compromised bone health. It is important to pay attention to bone health right for childhood. It is in this regard, schools may be advised to take steps regarding the following aspects : 1. Schools should promote outdoor physical activity after 9.00 a.m. and before 4.00 p.m. for adequate exposure to sunshine. Sunshine is the most important source of vitamin D. Vitamin. D helps absorption of calcium. The main source of vitamin D is the exposure to sunlight. Exposure of legs and arms to sunlight for about 25 minutes between 9 AM and 4 PM is adequate. Physical activity at all ages, particularly weight bearing activity, is important for bone health. It also reduces the risk of falling by strengthening muscles and maintaining bal- ance. Calcium is critical for sound bone health. Foods containing calcium like milk, leafy green vegetables, etc. should be a part of the normal daily diet.1513. During the educational programs, schools should emphasis the importance of calcium and vita- min D and thus the schools play a crucial role in creating awareness on such vital issues by sharing this message with the entire student community as well as the parents.

CBSE/ACAD/HELATH/2007 20th June,2007 Circular No. 29 All the Heads of the institutions affiliated to CBSE Subject : Comprehensive School Health Programme : Dear Principals, The Central Board of Scondary Education in continuation of its Circular No. 09 dated 31.5.2006 regarding Comprehensive School Health Programme and creating Health Club in school would like to reiterate and create awareness about the following issues : 1. School must have by now intiated the creation the creation of Health Clubs to implement the Comprehensive School Health Programme. i) Health and Wellnesss Clubs in schools need to focus on over all well being comprising mental and social health of the child. These would act as nodal centres for creating an enabling environment in the school to ensure an ambience of wellness and fostering reventive health care. ii) The Constitution, responsibilities and objectives of a Health Club have already been stated in the previous circular. iii) Activities for promoting health and wellness in schools have also been stated in the circular. 2.Comprehensive School Health Manual The Comprehensive School Health Manual addressed a basic gap in schooling that has crept in over the years. The is largely to do with the aspect of school health which has somehow been relegated to sporadic health check ups or in some cases a few hours of health instruction in the curriculum. It i s imperative that something is done urgently to take up the issue of holistic health. The School Healt h Policy and now the Manual proposes to view health holistically, utilize all educational opportunitie s for health promotion including formal and informal aproaches in curriculum and pedagogy. Providing a safe school environment, an activity oriented health education curriculum to avoid health-related risk behaviour, ensuring physical fitness activities and sports, providing nutritous snacks in the s chool canteen, ensuring access to primary health care services, providing emergency care for illness or injury, providing counselling services and integrated family and community activities and staff heal th promotion policy are some of the expectations that a school should fulfill as was advised earlier in the circular issued to all schools regarding setting up of Health Clubs. Comprehensive School Health Manual will be available to all schools by August 2007. 3.Health Websites : The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW), Government of India has commissioned a website on Health Living ( www.healthy-india.org ) to address the concerns in India on the lifestyle preventable diseases.153The objectives of the website are : a)to harmonize the burden of preventable chronic diseases in the country by creating awareness b)to bring in the need for a healthy lifestyle c)to create Agents of Change among school children with regard to health issues d)to encourage the setting up of a health fostering school e)to create awareness regarding canteens as social responsible outlets which inculate healthy eating behaviours f)to ensure that there is enough emphasis on physical activity in schools and on enjoyment of this physical activity. The website has been so designed that it is user - friendly and containg a number of dynamic section s for interative sessions. As India advances economically and gains greater control over traditional health threats, diseases related to distorted lifestyles and unhealthy living habits are rapidly growing as major public heal th problems. Imbalanced diet, physical inactivity, tobacco consumption and alcohol abuse are leading to many Indians suffering from diabetes, heart disease, cancer and lung disease. Many of these diseases are preventable. Such preventive efforts are best started in childhood and in schooling years. Armed with appropriate health information people can protect and promote their personal health and families can create healthy living conditions for individuals of all ages. Schools and colleges are important stakeholders in disseminating healthy lifestyle information to children and youth. Healthy India endeavours to advance consciousness of disease prevention opprtunities, encourage earlier detection and treatment of chronic diseases and foster healthy living through information an d resources on healthy lifestyle viz. Healthy Diet; Physical Activity; Dealing with Tobacoo and related health problems; Yoga Stress Management; Diabetes; Cancers; Heart Attacks and Strokes. We would request you to encourage students, teachers and staff to adopt healthy life style practices suggested in this useful site ( www.healthy-india.org ) and practice the provided advise therein.

Subject : Comprehensive School Health Programme and Release of School Health Manuals in four Volumes. Dear Principal, Children are the greatest asset of a country and those in school have a right to a happy and healthy life within the school environment as well as at home. Investment in the health of children is an investment in the future of the nation. It is essential to build on the components of knowledge relating to health and nutrition, develop healthy attitudes and enhance Life Skills to overcome the multiple health concerns affecting school going children both in the urban and remote areas of the country. This is further to our circulars (No. 09 dated 31.5.2006 and No. 29 dated 20.6.2007) on Comprehensiv e School Health Programme in which the Board has requested schools to set up `Health Clubs' in order t o implement the Comprehensive School Health Programme. It is heartening to note that some of the schools affiliated with the board have responded positively in this regard. Comprehensive School Health Programme and Health Manuals : The objectives of the School Health Club as mentioned in the earlier circular are also being reitera ted: To create Health Cards for each student To create a health newspaper at least twice a year / poster competition related to health issues To conduct surveys on health related concerns To organize ` health walks' as part of social campaigns To organize health fairs and immunization projects To tap the local resources in the community to arrange health talks To render service in any area affected by a disaster or a calamity To create health help line within the school to distress, cope with emotional and social behaviour and to clarify misconceptions regarding adolescent health To teach the students techniques of yoga and meditation from an early age To inculcate in the students healthy and positive ways of living To teach health songs on various health topics ................./- Celebration of important days (World Health Day - April 7) Creating awareness regarding `World No Tobacco Day' (May 31), `World AIDS Day (December 1) etc.156Health Manuals : The Comprehensive School Health Manuals address a basic gap in schooling that has crept in over the years. School Health has somehow been relegated to sporadic health check-ups or in some cases a few hours of health instruction in the curriculum. It was imperative that something is done urgently to take up the issue of holistic health in school going children which includes physical, mental, emotional and psychological health. The School Health Policy and now the Manuals propose to view health holistically, utilize all educational opportunities for health promotion including formal and informal approaches in curriculum pedagogy. Providing a safe school environment, an activity oriente d health education curriculum to avoid health-related risk behavior, ensuring physical fitness activit ies and sports, providing nutrituous snacks in the school canteen, ensuring access to primary health car e services and integrated family and community activities and a staff health promotion policy are some of the expectations that a school should fulfill. There are four Manuals in this package. The first Manual-Vol I is addressed to all stakeholders concerned with school health. The other three Manuals are activity based manuals for teachers. Vol II is Teachers Activity Manual which consist of activities for Primary Level (Classes I-V), Vol III is Teacher's Manual for Upper Primary Level (Classes VI-VIII) and Vol IV is Teachers' Manual for Second ary and Senior Secondary Level (Classes IX-XII). The activities revolve around six different themes - Knowing your Body, Food and Nutrition, Personal and Environmental Hygiene, Physical Fitness, Being Responsible and Safe and Behaviour and Life Skills. The objectives of the modules and activities is to focus on the different aspects of growth and age appropriate development of the child. The Manuals are holistic in their approach since they deal with not only physical health but also mental, social, emotional and spiritual well being. Their uniqueness lies in their participative and interactive approach. The activities mentioned can be easily incorporated in the classroom transacti on, keeping in mind that hands on learning is internalized faster than conventional learning. It is also recommended that teachers may modify or customize the activities according to their social, cultural and demographic needs. The activities for teachers in each Section are suggestive and it is earnestly hoped that they will carry on the spirit of each section through curriculum plus intervention strategies within the school. The activities are learner centred and will help to empower them to construct knowledge for themselves in a classroom or out of the class setting. ................./- The graded activities provided in the manual follow outcome based approach to learning, teaching and assessment. They are positive in attitude and stress on developing health promoting habits from an early age which emphasizes the concept of learning throughout life. For the success of the school health programme it has to be developed and implemented by a strong indigenous group committed teachers under the guidance of the dynamic head of the organization as well as a committed management. A special feature of this development would be a cooperative, caring and concerned atmosphere which it is hoped will be the key note of the school learning environment while implementing the programme. The integration of school and community efforts should be related where the school is regarded as a social unit providing a focal point from which the school may reach out to the family, to the local community and to the community at large as a whole which in turn may support the efforts of the school.157It is hoped that the Health Manuals will foster the need to provide for a healthy environment for ea ch child studying in a school and in that sense the CBSE Comprehensive School Health Program is dedicat ed to all children. The Health Clubs can be used to conduct the activities which are detailed in the School Health Manua ls in four Volumes being released to all the schools. One set of the four volumes is being sent to all schools free of cost, however, for additional volumes the school will have to make a request as thes e will be priced documents. These will be available from the Stores, CBSE, 17 Institutional Area, Rou se Avenue, New Delhi as well as from the Regional Offices.

CBSE/EO(L)/ACAD/2008 1st Sept.,2008 Circular No. 33/08 All the Heads of the institutions affiliated to CBSE. Subject : Creating a Healthy School Environment Dear Principal, One of the lofty aims of education is to shape young individuals into caring, thinking sensitive and value enriched citizens of the country. These are achievable when the schools provide a nurturing environment and create a value based climate within the school. The schools affiliated to CBSE are seen as powerful resources of Human Resource Development. This is possible and can be ensured only if the schools themselves are convinced of the positive benefits of a value enriched environment. The conflicting role models thrown up by the social context as well as the explosion of media often result in giving out ambiguous signals to young minds. It thus becomes even more mandatory that the schools serve as agents of change and transformation by bringing out the best from within each child. The inspiration, motivation and upliftment of spirit should go hand in glove with transactio n of academic knowledge. The Central Board of Secondary Education has received feedback about certain schools where the school authorities forcibly keep the children back in Classes IX & XI under various pretexts. This has been viewed very seriously. The Board requires all heads of institutions to reflect on the long ter m objectives of imparting holistic education in schools. It is impossible to create vibrance and a jo yful and friendly learning ambience to ensure there is collaborative synergy between learners, teachers, heads of the institutions, parents and the management of the school. Unless the heads of schools realize their own responsibility towards all these stakeholders there wi ll be a serious backlash from all these quarters. Cases of indiscipline, rowydism, bullying, smoking and other kinds of drug abuse in some institutions have also been reported to which a blind eye is turne d by the school authorities. The Adolescence Education Programme and the Life Skills ................/- Programme as well as the Comprehensive School Health Programme advocated by the Board focuses on the growing concerns of adolescence which need to be addressed with an urgency and immediacy and unless stringent action is taken at the right point of time in collaborati on with the parents of the adolescents it may become a matter of serious concern. Life Skills Educatio n is an excellent tool for bringing about positive behavioural changes in individuals. It is essential that all stakeholders involved in imparting value based education within the school environment should come together to find an answer to some of these areas that ultimately concern all of us. This may be brought to the notice of all teachers, students and parents through staff meetings / assembly meetings, circulars and advisory issued and reinforced from time to time.

CBSE/ACAD/CSHP/2008 6th Nov.,2008 Circular No. 49 All the Heads of the institutions affiliated to CBSE. Subject: Follow up on Comprehensive School Health Programme. Dear Principal, The Central Board of Secondary Education has recommended the setting up Health and Wellness Clubs and launched the four manuals in the package of Comprehensive School Health Manuals (vide circular no. 27 dated 24th June, 2008). We hope that you have received the following four volumes of the Comprehensive School Health Manuals : 1. Comprehensive School Health Teachers Activity Manual Volume I 2. Teacher's Manual for Classes I-V 3. Teachers' Activity Manual for Classes VI-VIII 4. Teachers' Activity Manual for Classes IX - XII In continuation of the above the Board would like to bring to you an advisory on some of the components related to health such as Physical Fitness, Substance Abuse and Emotional Concerns. 1. Physical Fitness : a. There should be at least 30 minutes of Physical Activities or games with maximum health benefits for Classes I-VIII everyday. a. For Classes IX - XII it should be ensured that all the students participate in Physical Activity / Games / Mass P .T / Yoga with maximum health benefits for at least 2 periods per week (90- 120 min / week). b. In case the school has constraints of space, climatic conditions, presence of enough PE Teachers, or coaches it may consider indoor activities which would provide maximum health benefits (Aerobics / Meditation & breathing exercises / Yoga). c. Mass P .T . in the morning keeping in view the climate conditions is another alternative the school can use. d. Too much of time being spent by children at house in watching TV or playing computer games needs to be carefully monitored by the parents. An advisory can be sent by schools to parents and reinforced in the beginning of every term. e. Parental Awareness Programmes regarding Adolescent concerns including the above may be held at regular intervals by the schools.1612. Eating Habits and Diet: School canteens should provide healthy snacks which can be monitored by the Health Clubs of the schools. Doctors / Nutritional Experts/ dieticians / Counsellors / Nurses/ Home Science Department may be involved in designing the recipes for the menu (healthy, nutritious, wholesome) and monitorin g quality of the food items. Junk / fast food needs to be replaced completely with healthy snacks. Carbonated and aerated beverages may be replaced by juices and diary products (Lassi, Chach, Flavored milk etc.) 3. Substance Abuse : Passive smoking is as harmful as indulging in active tobacco use. Awareness regarding the hazardous effects of passive smoking need to be created among the students and this may also be a part of the Parental Awareness Programmes. Awareness on recent laws enacted on prohibition of Tobacco products in public places needs to be created among students. Heads of Institutes should ensure that no Tobacco products should be sold either by minor or by major children in the vicinity of the educatio nal institutes. Regular vigilance against smoking at home and school needs to be emphasized. The matter can be discussed in PTA meetings with parents. Project work on Substance / Tobacco abuse may be assigned to students as part of school assignment across disciplines and `No Tobacco Week' may be celebrated in school. A substance abuse control committee at school level involving PTA member's local leaders and students may also be initiated. Value Education and Value Enhanced Life Skills should form a part of the larger curriculum plus activities in the schools. Schools should also be able to integrate unstructured programmes on Valu e Education through their Literary Clubs, Health Clubs and Eco Clubs. 4. Emotional Health: There is a need for Value Education aided Conceptual Framework of Life Skills related to values for sensitizing teachers and learners to the Universal Skills such as Thinking Skills (Creative and Crit ical Thinking, Self Awareness, Problem Solving, Decision Making), Social Skills (Interpersonal Relationsh ips, Effective Communication, Empathy) and Emotional Skills (Managing feeling / Emotions, Coping with Stress).

All students study Science as a compulsory subject upto grade X and a significant percentage of them continue studying Physics, Chemistry, Biology, BioTechnology, Home Science etc. at senior secondary level. This requi res conduct of regular practical work and use of variety of equipment, instruments, gadgets, materials, chemicals, glassware etc. It is of utmost importance that in order to ensure safety of students working in Science laboratories, every essential precaution is taken well in advance. It is not uncommon to observe that in many cases, the essential safety measures are either not given much attention or are ignored altogether. Gas fittings in chemistry laboratory often do not fulfil t he mandatory standards and requirements. Chemical are, in many cases, not stored in safe manner and kept under safe custody. It is also observed that exhaust fans are sometimes not provided in chemist ry laboratory. Mandatory items such as laboratory coats, goggles and gloves are not used while doing experimental work. Electrical fittings are at times done with sub-standard materials and components. Laboratories are not located with easy and open exits. Fire extinguishers are not installed at desir ed locations. First aid facilities are inadequate or missing. Medical facilities are also found wantin g on many occasions. All such negligent actions may result in dangerous and unfortunate incidents and need to be attended to urgently. In order to ensure safety of students in Science Laboratories, there is an urgent need to look into its different aspects and make the following provisions: Designing of all science laboratories according to necessary norms and standards. Two wide doors for unobstructed exits from the laboratory. Adequate number of fire extinguishers near science laboratories. Periodical checking of vulnerable points in the laboratories in relation to possibility of any mishappening. Ensuring gas fittings in Chemistry laboratory fulfilling desired norms and standards. Periodical checking of electrical fittings/ insulations for replacement and repairs. Timely and repeated instructions to students for careful handling of chemicals and equipments in the laboratory. Display of do's and dont's in the laboratory at prominent places. Safe and secure storage of all chemicals. Proper labelling and upkeep of chemicals. Proper safety and protection provisions such as fume hood, goggles and gloves while doing practical work. Careful supervision of students while doing practical work. Advance precautionary arrangements to meet any emergency situations. Conduct of any additional experimental work only under supervision and with due advance permission.164 Availability of First Aid and basic medical facilities in the school. Proper location of the laboratories. The tragic fire incident in a school at Kumbakonam in 2004 is still afresh in which nearly 100 child ren lost their precious lives. The Board had issued a detailed Circular no. 28/2004 dated 26th July, 200 4 asking schools to take all safety measures for meeting adverse situations and ensuring safe custody of children in the school. It is reiterated that all necessary safety measures may be taken and the above guidelines may be discussed in detail with the teachers as well as students for greater awaren ess and sensitization on safety matters. The Board may depute an expert team to visit your school to find out whether all safety provisions i n Science laboratories have been made.

Dear Principal, Schools are dynamic settings for promoting health and wellness through various correlated areas such as Physical Education and Sports as well as through Health and Wellness Clubs. There is a growing awareness that the health and psycho-social well-being of young children is of paramount importance and schools can provide a strategic means of improving children's health, self-esteem, life skills a nd behaviour. Healthy living incase of school children is the prime concern of all stakeholders including principa ls, parents, teachers and the community. To achieve this objective collective responsibility needs to be assumed. An important dimension is that of experience and development of health skills and physique through practical engagements with play, exercises, sports and practices of personal and community hygiene. The CBSE through its various advisories (Circular No. 09 dated 31.5.2006, Circular No. 29 dated 20th June, 2007, Circular No. 27/08 dated 24th June, 2008, Circular No. 49 dated 6th Nov., 2008 and Circular No. 57 dated 20.11.2009) has directed schools to set up Health and Wellness Clubs which can be used to conduct the activities which are detailed in the School Health Manuals in four volumes already released to all the schools. It is well established that participation in Physical Education & Sports activities is highly benefi cial to one's health and it leads to improved performance by students in schools, in addition to helping the m in developing many life skills. Children lead happier lives as a result of being actively involved in sporting activities and it has long been established that fitness and improved academics performance go hand in hand. Physical Education and Sports activities during the school hours reduce boredom and help keep students attentive in the classrooms. Keeping in view the above, the Central Board of Secondary Education has time and again recommended for providing compulsory time schedule for Physical Education & Sports activities for the students o f all classes. The Board is of the firm opinion that the Physical Education & Sports programs teach important conflict resolution skills including team work, fair play and communication leading to reduced viole nt behaviour among children. Further, children who participate in Physical Education & Sports develop a positive attitude towards their every day life activities. In the above background, it is advised that the following in respect of the Physical Education & Spo rts may be strictly adhered to: a. There should be at least 40-45 minutes of Physical Activities or Games period for Classes I-X everyday. b. For Classes XI - XII it should be ensured that all the students participate in Physical Activity / Games / Mass P .T / Yoga with maximum health benefits for at least two periods per week171(90-120 min / week). c. In case the school has constraints of space, climatic conditions, presence of enough PE Teachers, or coaches it may consider indoor activities which would provide maximum health benefits (Aerobics / Meditation / Yoga & Asanas). d. Mass P .T . in the morning keeping in view the climate conditions is another alternative the school can have. As part of Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation the students will be assessed on participation and performance in by choosing any two activities from the 13 activities given for Classes VI-VIII a nd 08 activities given for Classes IX-X. It is earnestly hoped that all schools will follow these directives to ensure that all students draw maximum health benefit in terms of physical fitness and team building as well as collaborative skill s. This may be brought to the notice of all teachers, students and parents.
