If you have type 2 diabetes, your doctor may prescribe them as part of your treatment plan. There are several different tablets in the SGLT2 group. Tablets in the work? SGLT2 inhibitors can help to lower your blood sugar levels by: - reducing the amount of glucose being absorbed in the kidneys so that it is passed out in the urine - reducing the amount of glucose in your blood. How well they work will depend on your kidney function. If you take SGLT2 tablets, you may experience some side effects. Check the Patient Information Leaflet (PIL) that comes with your medication. If you think you may be experiencing any of the side effects, speak to your GP straight away. It's also important to be aware that your urine will test positive for glucose if you take this medication. "}
