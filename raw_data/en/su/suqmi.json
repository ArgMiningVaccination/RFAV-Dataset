Even doctors do it, sending a patient to a specialist for one symptom and to someone entirely different for another. But humans are complex, so staying healthy means paying attention to all aspects of the person, including mental, emotional, and physical health. At [The Doctor's House](https://www.thedrshouse.com/about) in Edina, Minnesota, [Dr. Adepero Okulaja](https://www.thedrshouse.com/provider/adepero-okulaja-md) understands that total wellness involves the whole person, from diet and physical health to mood, stress levels, and spirituality. That's why she takes all of these components into consideration and creates a [total wellness](https://www.thedrshouse.com/service/total-wellness) plan that sets the people in her care on the journey toward optimal health. Here are a few ways your emotional well-being impacts your physical health and how Dr. Okulaja can help. It's easy to focus entirely on physical factors regarding health. This often leads to narrowing in on a specific symptom and concentrating on diet and getting enough exercise. Yes, these things play a part in health and wellness, but mental state plays a significant role as well. The mind/body connection acknowledges that your feelings, thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes can impact your biological functions. This approach isn't new. In fact, almost [every system of medicine throughout the world](https://www.takingcharge.csh.umn.edu/what-is-the-mind-body-connection) used to approach health in this way until approximately 300 years ago. During the 17th century, Western societies started thinking of the mind and body as two distinct entities instead of two intimately connected components. While this change created a foundation that advanced methods of care like trauma care, pharmaceuticals, and surgery, it also lost sight of a person's innate ability to heal. However, 20th-century research started drawing more attention back to these earlier concepts, confirming the medical and mental benefits of mind-body practices. You can experience mental states without being aware of them, whether positive or negative. Similarly, your mental state can trigger biological reactions. For example, if you feel anxious, your body produces stress hormones. Mind/body therapies help people become more consciously aware of mental state. That awareness means you can guide your mental state in a more positive direction, improving your overall health at the same time. Common forms of mind/body therapies include: Each of these activities can create a positive circle of wellness because a healthy mind impacts the body, and a healthy body impacts the mind.
