About 1. Ban biometric mass surveillance Across Europe, highly intrusive and rights-violating facial recognition and biometric processing technologies are quietly becoming ubiquitous in our public spaces. As the European Commission consults the public on what to do, EDRi calls on the Commission and EU Member States to ensure that such technologies are comprehensively banned in both law and practice. Keep walking. Nothing to see here... By the end of 2019, at least 15 European countries had experimented with invasive biometric mass surveillance technologies, such as facial recognition. These are designed to watch, track or analyse people, score them, and make judgements about them as they go about their daily lives. Worse still, many governments have done this in collaboration with secretive tech companies, in the absence of public debate, and without having demonstrated that the systems meet even the most basic thresholds of accountability, necessity, proportionality, legitimacy, legality or safeguarding. A few thousand cameras to rule them all Without privacy, you do not have the right to a private chat with your friends, your family, your boss or even your doctor. Your activism to save the planet becomes everyone's business. You will be caught when blowing the whistle on abuse and corruption, or when attending a political march that your government does not want you to attend. You lose the right to go to a religious service or Trade Union meeting without someone keeping an eye on you; to hug your partner without someone snooping; or to wander freely without someone thinking you are being suspicious. With constant mass surveillance, you lose a way to ever be truly alone. Instead, you become constantly surveilled and controlled. COVID-1984? Since the start of the Coronavirus pandemic, apps and other proposals have been suggested to rapidly expand bodily and health surveillance systems under the guise of public health. However, there is a real risk that the damage caused by widening surveillance measures will last long after the pandemic is over. For example, will employers remove the cameras doing temperature checks in offices after the pandemic? Biometric mass surveillance systems can exacerbate structural inequalities, accelerate unlawful profiling, have a chilling effect on their freedoms of expression and assembly, and put limits on everyone's ability to participate in public and social activities. Fanny Hidv\u00e9gi, Europe Policy Manager at EDRi member Access Now (AN) explains: \"Human rights apply in emergencies and health crises. We don't have to choose between privacy and health: protecting digital rights also promotes public health. The suspension of data protection rights in Hungary show why the EU needs to step up to protect fundamental rights.\" Biometric surveillance - an architecture of oppression Portrayed as an \"architecture of oppression\", the untargeted capture or processing of sensitive biometric data makes it possible for governments and companies to build up incredibly detailed permanent records of who you meet, where you go, and what you do. More, it allows these actors to use all these records against you - whether for law enforcement, public authority or even commercial uses. By linking them to faces and bodies, these permanent records become quite literally carved into your skin. The increased capacity of states to track and identify individuals through facial recognition and other biometric processing is likely to disproportionately impact populations which are already highly policed, surveilled and targeted by abuse, including people of colour, Roma and Muslim communities, social activists, LGBTQ+ people and people with irregular migration status. There can be no place for this in a democratic, rights-based, rule-of-law-respecting society. Ioannis Kouvakas, Legal Officer at EDRi member Privacy International (PI) warns that: \"The introduction of facial recognition into cities is a radical and dystopic idea which significantly threatens our freedoms and poses fundamental questions about the kind of societies we want to live in. As a highly intrusive surveillance technique, it can provide authorities with new opportunities to undermine democracy under the cloak of defending it. We need to permanently ban its roll out now before it's too late.\" EDRi is therefore calling for an immediate and indefinite ban on biometric mass surveillance across the European Union. Biometric mass surveillance is unlawful This ban is grounded in the rights and protections enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Law Enforcement Directive (LED) which are currently under the spotlight for their two-year anniversary reviews. Together, these instruments guarantee that the people of the EU can live without fear of arbitrary treatment or abuse of power; with respect for their autonomy and self-development; and in safety and security by setting strong data protection and privacy standards. Biometric mass surveillance constitutes a violation of the essence of these instruments, and a contravention of the very heart of the EU's fundamental rights. Once systems are in place that normalise and legitimise the 24/7 watching of everyone, all the time, it's a slippery slope towards authoritarianism. The EU must ensure, therefore, through legislative and non-legislative means, that biometric mass surveillance is comprehensively banned in law and in practice. Lotte Houwing, Policy Advisor at EDRi member Bits of Freedom (BoF) cautions that: \"We are shaping the world of tomorrow with the measures we are taking today. It is of utmost importance that we keep this in mind and do not let the COVID-19 crisis scare us in to a (mass) surveillance state. Surveillance is not a medicine.\" The EU regulates everything from medicines to children's toys. It is unimaginable that a drug which has not been shown to be effective, or a toy which poses significant risks to children's wellbeing, would be allowed onto the market. However, when it comes to biometric data capture and processing, in particular in an untargeted way in public spaces (i.e. mass surveillance), the EU has been a haven for unlawful biometric experimentation and surveillance. This has happened despite the fact that a 2020 study demonstrated that over 80% of Europeans are against sharing their facial data with authorities. EDRi calls on the EU Commission, European Parliament and Member States to stick to their values and protect our societies by banning biometric mass surveillance. Failing to do so will increase the risks of an uncontrolled and uncontrollable demise into a digital dystopia.

[COVID-Tech]: COVID infodemic and the lure of censorship In EDRi's series on COVID-19, COVIDTech, we will explore the critical principles for protecting fundamental rights while curtailing the spread of the virus, as outlined in the EDRi network's statement on the virus. Each post in this series will tackle a specific issue at the intersection of digital rights and the global pandemic in order to explore broader questions about how to protect fundamental rights in a time of crisis. In our statement, we emphasised the principle that states must \"defend freedom of expression and information\". In this second post of the series, we take a look at the impact on freedom of expression and information that the measures to fight the spread of misinformation could have. Automated tools, content-analysing algorithms, state-sponsored content moderation, all have become normal under COVID-19, and it is a threat to many of our essential fundamental rights. We already knew that social media companies perform pretty badly when it comes to moderate content on their platforms. Regardless of the measures they deploy (whether using automated processes or employing human moderators), they make discriminatory and arbitrary decisions. They fail to understand context and cultural and linguistic nuances. Lastly, they provide no proper effective access to remedies. In times of a global health crisis where accessing vital health information, keeping social contact and building solidarity networks are so important, online communications, including social media and other content hosting services, have become even more essential tools. Unfortunately, they are also vectors of disinformation and misinformation that erupt in such exceptional situations and threaten public safety and governmental responses. However, private companies - whether voluntarily or pressured by governments - should not impose over-strict, vague, or unpredictable restrictions on people's conversations about important topics. Automated tools don't work: what a surprise! As the COVID-19 crisis broke out, emergency health guidelines forced big social media companies to send their content moderators home. Facebook and the like promised to live up to expectations by basing daily content moderation on their so-called artificial intelligence. It only took a few hours to observe glitches in the system. Their \"anti-spam\" system was striking down quality COVID-19 content from trustworthy sources as violations of the platforms' community guidelines. Sharing newspaper articles, links to official governmental websites or simply mentioning the term \"coronavirus\" in a post would result in having your content preemptively blocked. This whole trend perfectly demonstrates why relying on automated processes can only be detrimental to freedom of expression and to freedom of receiving and imparting information. The current context led even the Alan Turing Institute to suggest that content moderators should be considered \"key workers\" in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Content filters show high margins of error and are prone to over-censoring. Yet the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the EU's response to the pandemic which calls on social network companies to proactively monitor and \"stop disinformation and hate speech\". In the meantime, the European Commission continues its \"voluntary approach\" with the social media platforms and contemplates the possibility to propose soon a regulation. Criminalising misinformation: a step too far In order to swiftly respond to the spreading of COVID-19 health crisis, some Member States desperately try to control the flow of the information about the spread of the virus. In their efforts, they are seduced by the adoption of hasty legislation that criminalises disinformation and misinformation which may ultimately lead to state sponsored censorship and suppression of public discourse. For instance, Romania granted new powers to its National Authority for Administration and Regulation in Communications to order take-down notices for websites containing \"fake news\". A draft legislation in its neighbour Bulgaria originally included the criminalisation of the spread of \"internet misinformation\" with fines of up to 1,000 euros and even imprisonment of up to three years. In Hungary, new emergency measures include the prosecution and potential imprisonment of those who spread \"false\" information. The risks of abuse of such measures and unjustified interference with the right to freedom of expression directly impair the media's ability to provide objective and critical information to the public, which is crucial for individuals' well-being in times of national health crisis. While extraordinary situations definitely require extraordinary measures, they have to remain proportional, necessary and legitimate. Both the EU and Member States must refrain from undue interference and censorship and instead focus on measures that promote media literacy and protect and support diverse media both online and offline. None of the approaches taken so far show a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that enable the creation, amplification and dissemination of disinformation as a result of curation algorithms and online advertising models. It is extremely risky for a democratic society to rely only on very few communications channels, owned by private actors of which the business model feeds itself from sensationalism and shock. The emergency measures that are being adopted in the fight against COVID-19 health crisis will determine how European democracies will look like in its aftermath. The upcoming Digital Services Act (DSA) is a great opportunity for the EU to address the monopolisation of our online communication space. Further action should be done specifically in relation to the micro-targeting practices of the online advertising industry (Ad Tech). This crisis also showed to us that the DSA needs to create meaningful transparency obligations for better understanding of the use of automation and for future research -starting with transparency reports that include information about content blocking and removal. What we need for a healthy public debate online are not gatekeepers entitled by governments to restrict content as in non-transparent and arbitrary manner. Instead, we need diversified, community-led and user-empowering initiatives, that allow everyone to contribute and participate.

Today we introduce our Portuguese member: D3 - Defesa dos Direitos Digitais. 1. Who are you and what is your organisation's goal and mission? We are a volunteer-run association dedicated to the defense of fundamental rights in the digital context. Our focus is to ensure autonomy and freedom of choice; uphold privacy and free access to information, knowledge and culture; and defend digital rights as a reinforcement to the principles of a democratic society. 2. How did it all begin, and how did your organisation develop its work? For many years there has been a gap within Portuguese civil society: there was no entity dedicated to digital rights issues. Some people would fight for them in their individual capacity, and a few organisations would cover them when absolutely needed, but often going beyond their original scope of action by doing so (such as free software organizations). Around 2016, some people got together and started to discuss how we could start such an organization. The objective was to coordinate the already existing civil society efforts in an organized and dedicated way, with a wide enough scope that would allow us to cover any issue within the field - not because we wanted to cover everything but because we wanted the freedom to tackle any of them. It finally happened in March 2017, and we have been active since then. 3. The biggest opportunity created by advancements in information and communication technology is... It can enable further universal access to many rights such as education, participation in democratic life, access to more information and data, tools for both on day to day life and to support the individuals and society in exceptional moments. 4. The biggest threat created by advancements in information and communication technology is... Lack of oversight and disregard of the dangers associated with technology and its usage; excess of optimism about the capacity of technology to solve problems for both the individuals and the society; magical thinking that comes with the lack of understanding of technology and science in general. 5. Which are the biggest victories/successes/achievements of your organisation? We managed to become the first divergent voice in matters where there used to be no entity representing the public interest. We brought new issues to the Portuguese public debate like data retention, copyright, net neutrality, electronic voting, public surveillance, and more. Our biggest achievement was having our data retention complaint to the Justice Ombudsman reach the Constitutional Court (the decision is still pending) 6. If your organisation could now change one thing in your country, what would that be? Exclude non-policy influences from public policy decision making. 7. What is the biggest challenge your organisation is currently facing in your country? Internally we face the usual issues related to the small scale of the country; for example, we could use more volunteers lending a hand. Externally, right now it is impossible to escape the subject of COVID-19, which is making some people fall prey to questionable tech-solutionism promises which are inspired by practices of non-democratic countries. 8. How can one get in touch with you if they want to help as a volunteer, or donate to support your work? You can reach us at geral@direitosdigitais.pt If you speak Portuguese, you can find more information on our website, including how to volunteer and how to donate. An English-language smaller scale version is also in our plans. Read more: EDRi Member in the spotlight series https://edri.org/member-in-the-spotlight/ D3 Home Page https://direitosdigitais.pt/ 4. Austria's biggest privacy scandal: residential addresses made public Nobody took data protection into account for the so-called Supplementary Register for Other Concerned Parties\" (Erg\u00e4nzungsregister f\u00fcr sonstige Betroffene). The Ministry for the Economy and the Finance Ministry are responsible for a data breach to which the Austrian Economic Chambers were an accomplice. Personal data of at least one million people have been publicly posted on the Internet for years without any protective measures, as NEOS and epicenter.works explained in a joint press conference on 8 May. This is a gift from the Republic to every data dealer and identity thief. \"The technical and organisational measures necessary for protecting the rights of the affected persons according to GDPR are completely absent\", adds epicenter.works' managing director Thomas Lohninger. In contrast to the Central Register of Residents (ZMR), all protective mechanisms are missing here, such as requiring identification of the querying person or charging a fee for the release of data, or the option to protect one's own data with an informational release block. Private residential addresses are particularly sensitive \"We do not yet know exactly how many people are affected by this data scandal and which groups are involved,\" Lohninger continues. \"According to our estimates, there must be about one million concerned people.\" It could also be deduced from the data when tax returns were filed or whether, for example, state assistance was received. \"What is even more dramatic is that the private residential addresses of these people are publicly available on the Internet and there is no way to defend oneself against it. From the Federal President downwards, almost everyone can be found there who has and has had income other than from non-self-employment\", the data protection expert adds. No purpose, no information block, no protective measures \"The purpose of this public register is not apparent. Public registers regularly entail rights and obligations, such as Entries in the Civil Register, Register of Companies or Register of Associations. Although the internal provision of source numbers within the administration may be the reason for the creation of the supplementary register, this does not explain its years of public and barrier-free access,\" says epicenter.works' lawyer Lisa Seidl. In many cases, the scope of the accessible data goes beyond the data that can be retrieved from the ZMR and, in contrast, there are no protective mechanisms, such requiring the identification of the querying person, charging a fee for the release of information or providing the option of setting up an informational release block. Even if the 2009 regulation provides a legal basis for the publication of the register, this regulation could constitute a violation of the fundamental right to data protection, said Seidl. On the basis of redacted excerpts from this database, we can show that the data of journalists, politicians and other persons who are particularly concerned about the confidentiality of their private data were included. For example, out of 183 members of Parliament, 100 were visible with their private addresses. You can find a corresponding list here. Furthermore, many Public Broadcasting (ORF) journalists could be found easily. How is this different from the Commercial Register? The Commercial Register is easily accessible, but it costs quite a lot - 12.90\u20ac per extract - and is essential (i.e. it has an important purpose), because you have to and should know about the economic risk you are taking when you sign contracts with other companies. In any case, it does not contain private residential addresses, but the business addresses of the companies. Is the regulation potentially even illegal or unconstitutional? In principle, the Austrian state must comply with GDPR, but it is exempt from penalties. If data that are not already publicly accessible (e.g. tax data of private individuals - not companies!) are in the register, this needs its own legal basis (in this case a decree), and only then according to the GDPR the data can be processed. However, this decree could still be unconstitutional (\u00a71 of the Data Protection Act (DSG) has constitutional status). Justified constraints of fundamental rights always require a legitimate objective that is necessary and proportionate. The register falls at this first hurdle, as making tax data accessible for the public is not a \"legitimate objective\". Therefore, the constraint of fundamental rights is unjustified and a violation of the fundamental right to data protection. As long as the Austrian Constitutional Court has not repealed the regulation on the grounds of unlawfulness or unconstitutionality, it is to be applied. Chronology of the register - Decision to establish this register publicly 2004/2009, Sch\u00fcssel / Faymann - Register transferred to the Austrian Ministry for the Economy in December 2018 without question, no protective measures established, despite introduction of GDPR no enforcement of the rights of those affected - Austrian Finance Ministry continuously sends data to registers, unclear from which sources Read more: Wohnadressen \u00f6ffentlich (08.05.2020) https://en.epicenter.works/content/grosster-datenskandal-der-republik-uber-eine-million-wohnadressen-offentlich Austrian government hacking law is unconstitutional (18.02.2019) https://edri.org/austrian-government-hacking-law-is-unconstitutional Austrian postal service involved in a data scandal (28.01.2019) https://edri.org/austrian-postal-service-involved-in-a-data-scandal/ (Contribution by Thomas Lohninger, from EDRi Member epicenter.works) 5. Xnet issues two complaints to improve data protection in Spain Xnet highlights gaps in Spain's adaptation of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The Spanish member of EDRi has opened two complaints to the European Commission related to the lack of effective adaptation of the data minimisation principle and the lack of conciliation between personal data protection and freedom of expression and information in the Spanish legislation. The COVID-19 Crisis has forcefully put on the table the scope to which the extraction and use of citizens' personal data may reach. These problems had already been detected and explained in a February 2020 report by Xnet, \"Privacy, Data Protection and Institutionalised Abuses\" and with the campaign #DatosPorLiebre. Xnet believes that the use of personal data in the general interest is necessary. However, it should never conflict with the respect for the fundamental rights to privacy and intimacy. The procedures that Xnet is now starting are a consequence of the report, but the EDRi member believes that they will also be useful in the design of policies post-COVID-19. The European Commission has published a position that supports Xnet's point of view. This could positively influence the new Spanish Secretary-General for Digital Transformation. This is why Xnet considers that this is a good moment to start these two procedures. As Xnet explained in the report \"Privacy, Data Protection and Institutionalised Abuses\", they consider that the \"Organic Law on Data Protection and the Guarantee of Digital Rights\", which aims to adapt the GDPR to the Spanish system, contains gaps that are detrimental to fundamental rights. The report and the procedures explain the collision between the principle of minimisation, which is fundamental in the GDPR, and other laws in force that prevent its enforcement and the control of personal data, their use and destination by individuals. Specifically, the identification requirements of citizens when they want to carry out any type of procedure, however simple it may be, at a Public Administration or other companies, are abusive and disproportionate. These identification requirements of Spanish legislation are no longer justified in the new framework established by the GDPR. The principle of minimisation establishes that no one should ask or extract more data than necessary. The privacy must be by design and by default. The second procedure highlights the lack of transposition of Article 85 of the Regulation into national law, thus failing to comply with the obligation that it establishes to reconcile the right to personal data protection with the freedoms of expression and information. This makes it difficult to uncover cases of abuse or corruption, which is very necessary in a situation such as this one.
