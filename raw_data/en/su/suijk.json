JACOBSON, M.D. Vice Chancellor for Health AffairsDEAN DIXON This year we are celebrating the 125th anniversary of theVanderbilt School of Medicine. In 1875 the first graduate ofthe newly constituted VanderbiltUniversity, William Henry Morgan, wasawarded an M.D. and sent off to begin hispractice. He entered the world of medi - cine just a decade removed from the shad- ow of the Civil War. His surgical tools were not vastly different from a carpen-ter's. His arsenal of medicine was barelyadvanced beyond those of a medievalalchemist. Anesthesia was a novelty, anti-septics were brand new, and x-rays wouldnot be discovered for another 20 years. The same explosion of knowledge we've gained in the last 125 years will bematched by the end of this decade. It is asobering reflection for those of us who havechosen careers in preparing the next genera-tion of physicians and scientists. It leads meto wonder what medicine might look likewhen the Class of 2025 prepares to enterthe practice of medicine, on the 150thanniversary of the School of Medicine. Newborns will enter the world with their genetic code not only written withintheir cells but in their medical records, too.We'll know their genetic susceptibilitiesand we'll advise their parents accordingly. We will treat their illnesses with drugsmade especially for them to mimic, blockor promote their own cellular chemistry.We'll rebuild cartilage, bone and sinewwith tissue cultured from the patients' ownstem cells. We'll perform surgeries withsmaller tools with the aid of increasinglysophisticated computers and robotics.Some of the debilitating chronic diseases oftoday might be little more than inconven - iences in that tomorrow 25 years from now. Medical education will need to change just as dramatically. For those of us in prac- tice today, it has become increasingly diffi - cult to stay on top of wave of discovery and innovation sweeping across medicine. Werely on our professional societies, journalsand contact with our colleagues. But thatantiquated system is groaning under theweight of new information, new discoveryand new innovation. In 1875, Dr. Morgan's teachers sent him out into the world of medicine like abullet shot out of a Tennessee long rifle -propelled by all the knowledge they couldgather into those years of training with atrajectory shaped and spun by the rifling ofscience. Dr. Morgan took the trajectory of that education and rode it through hiswhole career in medicine. Today's studentscan't expect the same thing from their fouryears here. The world simply changes toorapidly. We need to think of our studentsand graduates as guided missiles, not bullets.We might be able to help them achievelaunch velocity in their training at Vanderbiltbut we acknowledge that we need to domore. We must help them make the infinitenumber of mid-course corrections they willneed to make in order to respond to changesin knowledge and practice. Look for the School of Medicine to fulfill our lifelong commitment to ourgraduates - from opening our EskindBiomedical Library and research servicesfor our graduates, pioneering internet - basedtraining and formulating ways of bringingknowledge to the fingertips of practitionerswhen they need it. It is part of ourcovenant with each of the remarkably tal-ented young people who have broughttheir intellect, their aspirations and theirhopes to us over the last 125 years. alifelongcommitmentpage 3VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTERFall 2000 The School of Medicine has created a new Department of Cancer Biology, the first newbasic science department since the establish-ment of Microbiology and Immunology in 1955. Lynn M. Matrisian, Ph.D., leader of the Host-Tumor Interaction research programwith the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Centerand internationally recognized researcher inthe role of proteolytic enzymes in cancer, hasbeen named as the department's first chair. Creation of the new department recog - nizes the organization and focus of the fieldof cancer biology as a discipline in its ownright. Establishment of the new department Does ice really help bone and joint injuries heal or is it just a superficial remedy? Sports medicine researchers at VUMC have asked the questions, and for the first timethey have solid scientific proof about theeffectiveness deep inside the knee of iceapplied topically. \"We have proven that not only does the ice cool the superficial aspect of the joint, wenow know that the ice actually cools the innerlining of the knee, the synovium,\" said Dr.Kurt P. Spindler, associate professor ofOrthopaedics and Rehabilitation and directorof Vanderbilt Sports Medicine. \"And we know that the synovium is the active component in the knee that producesall the inflammation. It produces chemicalmediators, cytokines that can produce a lot ofpain and inflammation. No one has evershown until now that ice applied externallyactually cools the knee down internally,\" \"Hundreds of thousands of routine arthro- scopies are done each year and this informa - tion will help all of us reduce the trauma on the synovium, thereby helping the patientheal quicker and with better results.\" Spindler supervised two studies on cool- ing the knee, which produced these newresults. He said the new research can alsohelp the general public struggling with aknee or other joint injury - the studies showthat applying ice and some general compres-sion to the area is a good idea. Spindler says he is thrilled to find a scientif- ic basis for what people have done for manyyears. \"People have given up using ice in recent years saying even if it works, it's because ofthe peripheral skin effect that helps with paincontrol. What we are saying is, 'No, it's morethan that. It is actually working where wewant it to work, at the deeper level inside theknee, at the synovium, the structure that is so critical in its reaction to trauma and injury.'\" The original idea for this study, Spindler says, came from a Vanderbilt University med-ical student, Hilary Ann Peterson, VUSM 2000. \"It is just the power of academics. The power of young people asking questions,even though you think they are alreadyanswered.\"over time to about 20 faculty, will begin with a core group of about six faculty from the cur-rent department of Cell Biology. The overarching theme to the research conducted in the Cancer Biology Departmentwill be the communication pathwaysbetween cells and their environment,Matrisian said. \"The cues that the cells takefrom the environment are often disrupted incancer, so it provides an excellent place totarget therapy and prevention strategies.\" Dr. Harold L. Moses, Benjamin F. Byrd Professor of Oncology and director of theVanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, said thatestablishment of the new department willhelp Vanderbilt-Ingram capitalize on theopportunity to recruit new scientists present-ed by the ongoing \"Imagine A World WithoutCancer Campaign.\" The $100 million fund-raising campaign was launched last year witha gift from the Ingram Charitable Fund.was sparked by Vanderbilt University Medical Center's desire to enhance the quality andquantity of its research and to increase itsnational visibility in research and medicaleducation overall, said Dr. Harry Jacobson,vice chancellor for Health Affairs. \"Achieving this goal will involve increasing research strengths in both our clinical andbasic science departments,\" Jacobson said.\"We believe that the development of addi-tional basic science departments, such asCancer Biology, is the most desirableapproach, rather than increasing the size ofdepartments or changing the scope ofresponsibility for department chairs in orderto manage and mentor ever-larger numbersof faculty.\" The new department, expected to grow New basic science department formed by Cynthia Manley Giving injuries the cold shoulder by Barb Cramer DANA JOHNSON Dr. Kurt P. Spindlerpage 4Fall 2000 he New York City office of Dr. Joseph A. Cook seems an unlikely place to be implementing a program aimed at eradi - cating a blinding, bacterial eye condition found in some of the poorest countries ofthe world. In his small, plain office, located only half a block from famed Fifth Avenue andits extravagant designer shops, Cook,MD'64, is waging a war against trachoma,the world's leading cause of preventableblindness. As executive director of the International Trachoma Initiative (ITI),Cook directs a non-profit organizationfounded by Pfizer Inc and the EdnaMcConnell Clark Foundation. The goal issimple, yet very daunting - eliminating adisease that currently blinds six millionpeople and infects another 150 million.About half a billion people or 10 percentof the world's population, are at risk ofinfection. Founded in 1998, the ITI is working with five countries - Ghana, Mali,Morocco, Tanzania and Vietnam - to con-trol trachoma. The countries were selectedfrom a World Health Organization priori -ty list. The ITI's strategy is called SAFE: Surgery to correct advanced-stage tra - choma; Antibiotics to treat active infec- tion; Face washing to reduce disease trans- mission; and Environmental change to increase access to clean water, improvedsanitation and health education. Pfizer isdonating the drug Zithromax for the \"A\"in the strategy. A single dose of this oraldrug replaces six weeks of tetracycline eyeointment. \"With the improvement of sanitation and hygiene, trachoma will go away. Weknow that,\" Cook said. \"Trachoma is acommon disease and we feel we have awinning strategy. If we can put into placeprimary prevention, along with the cura-tive measures, we will succeed. In placeslike Tanzania, families have to walk 2 to 3kilometers for water, but we're trying toshow them that they can keep their chil-dren's' faces clean, and it only takes a verysmall amount of water. We know for a factthat a gourd or a coffee can with a hole init can wash the faces of 20 to 25 children - about a liter or a liter and a half of water.\" Trachoma was once prevalent in the United States. When the first immigrantscame to Ellis Island, many brought the dis - ease with them. Physicians marked the immigrants' collars with an \"E\" for eye andthey were detained from leaving while theywere treated. The last hospital for tra- choma, located in Missouri, closed in the late 1930s. Now, it's endemic in parts of Africa, Asia, the Middle East, Latin America andAustralia. Active infection usually beginsin early childhood when the bacterium,Chlamydia trachomatis, causes an irritat - ing infection of the eye. Through the dis- charge from the eyes of an infected child,trachoma is spread easily from person toperson - by hands, on clothing or by fliesthat are attracted to runny eyes and noses.Blindness occurs after repeated infectionswhen the eyelashes turn inward and abradethe cornea. Women are blinded two to Tavenuea longway fromfifthby Nancy Humphrey page 5Fall 2000 three times as often as men. Cook, who was president of his grad - uating class at Vanderbilt and a member of AOA, said \"extraordinarily good luck\"played a part in his becoming involved ininternational health. While completing hisresidency in internal medicine at theUniversity of North Carolina Hospital,Chapel Hill, the chairman of the depart-ment of medicine introduced him to Dr.Robert Watson, who had just retired fromthe Rockefeller Foundation. Following that meeting, Cook received a Foundationfellowship to study tropical public healthat Harvard. When he completed the fel - lowship, he was hired by the Rockefeller Foundation to work on a project control-ling schistosomiasis in St. Lucia. Aftereight years, he went to work at theNational Institute of Allergy andInfectious Diseases then continued hisschistosomiasis work for the EdnaMcConnell Clark Foundation directing their tropical disease research program forthe next 20 years. In 1985, as the drugtreatment for schistosomiasis improved,the foundation began looking for anotherfocus. They saw an opportunity to make adifference in supporting the immunology,epidemiology and control of trachoma.When the philanthropic arm of Pfizeragreed to get involved, the ITI was found-ed. The results of the ITI plan, although preliminary, are promising. During thefirst 18 months of the program inTanzania and Morocco, the prevalence ofactive infection in children under 10 hasbeen cut in half. In Tanzania, about 75percent of the people said they didn'tknow how to prevent trachoma when theprogram began. That number has nowbeen reduced to 34 percent. More than _million people have been treated with theantibiotic Zithromax. Cook spends about 25 percent of his time outside New York City, visiting thefive countries and participating in theWorld Health Organization Alliance forthe Global Elimination of Trachoma by2020 (GET2020). Cook finds his work in administration and fund raising fulfilling. \"People who haven't been in the developing world don't realize how desper - ately poor a large percentage of the world's population really is,\" he said. \"The poorestpeople in any community have trachomaand the poorest hygiene. Although it isonly one of many problems, knowing thatwe are making a lasting improvement inthe lives of these people, is a very reward - ing thing.\" e Dr. Joseph Cook watches as antibiotics are given for the treatment of trachoma during a 1999 trip to Morocco. VROBERT WALLISh page 6Fall 2000 devastationof a page 7Fall 2000 a When schizophr enia hits, its debilitating and baffling effects can last a lifetime. Treatment during and after the first episode, until recently, has not prevented the functionalimpairment. But there's a brief period before a patient is diagnosed wher e the characteristic behavior of a pre-schizophrenic patient mayoffer hints that the devastation of schizophrenia isn't far behind. by Nancy Humphrey page 8Fall 2000 This phase of the illness is being studied by a multi-discipli - nary group at Vanderbilt led by Dr. Herbert Y. Meltzer, director of the division ofPsychopharmacology, one of thenation's leading experts in schizo-phrenia, and Dr. Myung A. Lee,associate professor of Psychiatry. Schizophrenia is a lifelong ill- ness that affects about one percent ofthe population. Characterized by\"positive symptoms\" such as delu- sions and and \"negative symptoms\" such aswithdrawal, lack of pleasure andlack of motivation, the diseaseusually manifests between theages of 17 and 25. About 9 to 13percent of patients with schizo-phrenia commit suicide. \"Most people think of schizo- phrenia as a split personality butit's anything but that,\" Meltzersaid. \"Schizophrenia should beunderstood as a cognitive disorder.Our main objective is to restorethe research and treatment focus tothe idea that it's basically a cogni - tive disorder and much closer inspirit to dementias like Alzheimer'sDisease than it is to the group of drug-induced psychosis.\" There is a period of one to two years before the delusions and hallucinations ofschizophrenia emerge, the prodromal peri-od, where various types of behaviors mayoffer clues to the impending emergence ofpsychotic symptoms such as paranoia, delu-sions and hallucinations, Meltzer said.During this time patients may becomewithdrawn, have difficulty concentrating ormay become depressed or disheveled. \"My firm belief about schizophrenia is that it is essential to prevent it. Our treat - ments are rarely able to restore patients totheir prior level of function,\" Meltzer said,adding that about 30 percent of patients with schizophrenia have persistent psychot- ic symptoms. If quality of life issues are con- sidered, like being able to work and takepart in social activities, about 90 percent ofschizophrenics are considered to be treat-ment-resistant. \"Once it's developed, the cognitive impairment is so devastating from the pointof view of function that even though newdrugs can help, most of our patients can getonly part of the way back to normal. Priorto psychosis, most have only very mild cog-nitive impairment.\" Meltzer said the Vanderbilt research is looking at what happens to the brain duringthe prodrome period and whether medications can preventor delay the development of cog - nitive impairment. \"Even delaying the develop- ment for two to five yearsthrough late adolescence or intothe 30s, when people have estab-lished adult patterns of work andinterpersonal relationships,would be an enormous benefit,\"he said. \"By the time delusions orhallucinations develop, there isalready devastating and persistentdamage to cognitive function.\" Very little is known about the prodrome period, Meltzersaid, and it is extremely difficultto find patients to study sincethey are normally not hospital-ized and often only mildly dys-functional during this time. Meltzer and others at VUMC are using a rat animal model based upon prior work atYale and Nagoya (Japan)Universities, to learn if drugtreatment can prevent the cogni - tive devastation that occurs withschizophrenia. The researchfocuses on how phencyclidine (PCP, sometimes referred to as Angel Dust)mimics the cognitive deficits of schizophre-nia as well as the delusions and hallucina-tions. The Vanderbilt group has alreadylearned how to reverse the cognitive damageonce it occurs and is studying how to pre-vent it from developing in the first place. Further development of the animal model is being aided by a prestigious grantfrom the National Alliance for Research inSchizophrenia and Depression as well asfrom funding generated by a $610,000endowment from Donald Test of Dallasand his ex-wife, Lydia, in honor of Dr. JackMartin, MD'53, a Dallas psychiatrist. (seeaccompanying article). Dr. Change Kim Most people think of schizophrenia as a split personality, but it's anything but that. page 9Fall 2000 from Yonsei University in Seoul, Korea, has joined the Vanderbilt group to work on thismodel. A separate gift of $150,000 between1989 and 1993, by another patient,endowed the Jack Martin Scholarship Fundat VUSM. Another area of Meltzer's research focuses on developing the next generationof anti-psychotic drugs. He is one of the co-developers of the drug clozapine, used totreat patients with schizophrenia. A newresearch program, jointly directed by Dr.Junji Ichikawa, assistant professor of pscyhi- atry, looks at the mechanism of action of some of the new anti-psychotic drugs,specifically focusing on the drugs' abilitiesto affect the transmitters dopamine andacetylcholine in the frontal cortex of thebrain. Dr. Zhu hi from Shenyang, China, isjoining the Vanderbilt research team toaccelerate progress in this area. So far the research is showing that the atypical drugs, drugs that improve psychosiswithout some of the Parkinsonism-like sideeffects, selectively enhance dopamine andacetylcholine function in the cortex - afinding that has also stimulated research touse these drugs to treat early Alzheimer'sdisease. With the aid of Sohee Park, Ph.D., associate professor of Psychology, a new fac-ulty member, the research team will be able to image the cognitive functions of thebrain using the functional MRI. The teamwill be looking at how anti-psychotic drugsimprove memory, learning and attention. \"We know that in the absence of these drugs, the mechanisms that people withschizophrenia often employ in theirattempts to learn and remember and attendto the things they should attend to are don't work to learn something so they develop alterna-tive pathways. There are problems withconnectivity,\" he said. \"We know thesedrugs can significantly improve the func-tion, and allow patients to remember betterand learn better. With the fMRI scanner, we will be able to see if it's because the connectivity is com-pletely rearranged and they're using thesame modalities that others use, or if it'sbecause their abnormal mechanism is func - tioning a little more effectively, or somecombination of both.\" Another area of research is in pharma- cogenetics. Meltzer and his team are looking at the genes that cause anti-psychotic drugs toproduce weight gain and other side effectsand the genes that areinvolved in the specificsymptoms of schizo-phrenia, like hallucina-tions. Specifically, theyare looking for the genesthat modulate how good the response isgoing to be to a particular drug. \"Our hope is that it eventually will lead to the genetic means of predicting whichpatients should receive a particular drug. Right now when we evaluate a patient we have five to seven drugs to choose from.Everybody's looking for help in decidingwhich of those drugs would be best for theirpatient to start with.\" Finally, Dr. Robert M. Kessler, profes- sor of Radiology and Radiological Sciences,has developed a ligand for measuringdopamine receptor occupancy in key areasof the brain which have eluded previousefforts to quantify them. Kessler andMeltzer have already made observationswhich challenge established concepts abouthow the atypical anti-psychotic drugs work. \"We feel very lucky to be able to work in an era when major advances in schizo - phrenia research are happening with dra-matic rapidity,\" Meltzer said. Making a Difference The grateful friends and families of patients of Dr. Jack Martin, MD '53 are quietly helping fund theresearch of Dr. Herbert Y. Meltzer, one of thenation's leading experts in schizophrenia. When friends asked Martin how they might rec- ognize his good work and support efforts to findanswers to the causes and treatment of schizophre-nia, he suggested his alma mater and the cuttingedge work of Meltzer. Two of Martin's friends madesignificant gifts in his honor for the benefit of brain research. Donald Test of Dallas has ensured thisresearch will continue through a commitment to anendowed fund, which also honors Martin. Martin, of Dallas, is no stranger to grateful gifts made in his honor. In April 1989, Murphy H. Baxterof Houston, made a gift to VUMC to endow the JackMartin Scholarship Fund.

Vanderbilt University Medical Center was one of the participating 30 centers in thestudy, which focused on the effect of supple-mental oxygen in treating retinopathy of pre-maturity (ROP). The study was called theSupplemental Therapeutic Oxygen for Pre-threshold ROP (STOP-ROP) study. The findings, published in Pediatrics, mean that clinicians don't have to be as restrictiveas they have been when giving supplementaloxygen to infants who have already devel - oped moderate ROP. Many premature infants need supplemen- tal oxygen soon after birth because theirlungs are not sufficiently mature enough toefficiently transfer oxygen into their bodies,babies. Premature babies during the 50s were usually considered 30 to 32 weeks. The study, which began in 1994, grouped half of the 649 babies into a group receivingnormal amounts of oxygen and half into agroup receiving a greater amount. The find-ing: the eyes of the group receiving higheramounts did not worsen, but also did notimprove significantly. In the group receivingnormal amounts of oxygen, 48 percent wenton to need surgery. In the group receivingsupplemental oxygen, 41 percent requiredsurgery, Walsh said.said Dr. William F. Walsh, professor of Pediatrics. It has long been believed that sup-plemental oxygen, while helping infants sur-vive, might also increase the occurrence andseverity of ROP. About 225 babies are born at Vanderbilt University Medical Center each year at risk forROP. However, there are not many babieswho actually do go on to develop ROP. In fact,Vanderbilt has such a low incidence that theyonly enrolled 7 in the study, instead of theestimated 30, and had to drop out of thestudy. Walsh said the debate about supplemental oxygen and ROP has been ongoing for morethan 50 years. An epidemic of blindness inpremature infants in the late 1940s and early1950s was believed to be associated with theincreased amount of oxygen given to the Oxygen safe for ROP infants by Nancy Humphrey Dr. Arnold Strauss Dr. Martin Sandler page 11Plop, plop, fizz, fizz. Oh, what a relief it is. The catchy jingle rep- resents what was once thought of as the most prominent weapon against heartburn. In recent years, however, the public has been inundated with advertisements for heartburn relief products. There are even dozens of web sites dedicated to the topic. Why all the fuss? At worst, heartburn is just a nuisance, right? \"Heartburn is a significant problem,\" says Dr. Glenn M. Eisen, associ- ate professor of Medicine in Gastroenterology. Studies indicate about seven percent of the U.S. population experiences heartburn or other symptoms of gastroe- sophageal reflux disease (GERD) every day. About 20 percent have at least weekly heartburn. The good news is that the vast majority of people with heartburn and reflux problems can be easily treated, Eisen said. \"The problem is that very few people consider it a disease, but rather a nuisance and just live with it.\" Heartburn occurs when gastric acids from the stomach splash back up into the lower por- tion of the esophagus, causing pain and discomfort. Eisen recommends lifestyle modification for people who suffer from occasional reflux, or typical heartburn, particularly after a big meal or alcohol consumption. These can include: avoiding eating for at least several hours before bedtime elevating the head of the bed for those who have symptoms while lying down avoiding foods known to cause stomach irritation (chocolate, garlic, onions, peppermint, citrus fruits) For those people who don't want to forego their favorite indulgences, antacids might be the best bet. Eisen recommends the liquid form because it works the fastest. Patients with recurring symptoms need stronger therapy such as H2 blockers, which are available over the counter, and another class of medications known as proton pump inhibitors,now considered the standard treatment for patients who experience regular heartburn or refluxsymptoms. These medications are very effective in eliminating heartburn symptoms in about90 percent of patients, Eisen said. People who experience severe symptoms such as difficulty swallowing, vomiting blood, severe abdominal pain, or unexplained weight loss may need to undergo endoscopy, and forthose patients whose disease cannot be successfully managed by medication, surgery presentsan option. The newly formed Heartburn Center at VUMC can help determine the appropri-ate treatment plan for each individual. Fortunately, there are very few patients who don't respond to medication, and in most cases, Alka Seltzer will do the trick. Fall 2000 HEALTH TALK The ofheartacheheartburnby Kathleen Whitney V page 12Fall 2000 Thedefinitiv edeanSaying there's nobody quite like Dean John E. Chapman isn't just a compliment. There really isn't. Chapman is the longest-tenured dean in the medical education profession. He's graduated 3,317 medical students over the past 25 years. The second longest-tenured dean ofany of the other 125 accredited medical schools in the coun- try recently retired after 17 years. Chapman is stepping down as dean of the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, a post he has held for the past quarter-century, to take on a new role - associate vice-chan- cellor for M edical Alumni Affairs. It's hard to separate Chapman from medical education at Vanderbilt, the two hav e been together so long. N ot only has he conferred medical degrees to two-thirds of the living graduates of VUSM, appointed most of Vanderbilt UniversityMedical Center 's mor e than 1,000 faculty members, and been part of the appointment process for every current depar tment chair , he has also overseen the initiatives that have led to the medical school being consistently ranked numberone in the nation in terms of student satisfaction. In 1987, the Karolinska Institute of Stockholm, Sweden awarded Chapman an honorary Doctor of Medicine degreefor his \" conspicuous contribution to medical education worldwide.\" A national search for Vanderbilt's eighth medical school dean is underway. Ask students what impr esses them most about Chapman and they'll recall his reassuring first-day and commencement addresses, his accessibility and his humor. The Dean's Cadaver Ball characters - Gen. George Patton, Alfred Hitchcock,Darth Vader and Superman to name a few -- have reached leg- endar y status. Ask fello w faculty members and colleagues at other institutions and you'll hear a deep admiration for hisdedication and commitment to Vanderbilt. Some of those who have worked closest with Chapman over the past quarter century were asked their thoughts about \"the D ean.\" page 13Fall of Anesthesiology and Pharmacology, VUMC \"When I was graduating in 1990, my wife was pregnant with our sonJimmy, now 9, and was having aterribly difficult time with pre-term labor. Dean Chapman calledme about two weeks before gradu-ation and offered to set up a smallgraduation ceremony at our home,so that Melinda could see me grad-uate. Melinda's preterm laborimproved and it turned out not tobe necessary, but his willingness todo this for just one medical studentleft a lasting impression.\"Dr. Steven C. Beering, president Purdue University \"I am privileged to know and to have worked with John Chapmanfor 35 years. He is tremendouslyadmired and respected for hisintellect and his vision. He'simmensely capable as a clinicianand administrator but through itall he's been the students' bestfriend. He's a role model of finestprinciples. He's a remarkableindividual. I just can't say enoughabout him. He's a dear friend andone whom I admire endlessly. Ilove this man. Our relationship isa conversation without a begin - ning and an end. When we haven't seen each other in awhile,we get together and pick right up \" Dr. L. Thompson Bowles, for- mer president of the National Board of Medical Examiners \"I believe Dean Chapman has been among the most importantcontributors to the United Statesduring the last half of the 20thcentury.

He puts his whole self ineverything he does, but he's alwaysbeen available if I need him.\" Dr. Lewis B. Lefkowitz Jr. pro- fessor of Preventive Medicine,VUMC, from a letter written toDean Chapman \"Your tenure here has meant some - thing very special to me, a squarepeg that has stared into many around hole in this academic envi-ronment over these 34 long years.You have always been there to pro - vide the requisite square holes forme; and, for that, I am ever grate-ful. As a consequence, I have beenenabled to fulfill my own, deeplyfelt personal mission of teaching;and, I hope, to make a lasting con-tribution that, without your con-sistent support, concurrence andinterest, would have been impossi-ble. I will think of these kindnessesall my days. You must know howmuch it has meant to me to be apart of the Vanderbilt educationalenterprise, and to share with you,my students, my colleagues, and theentire medical school family, in thefeeling of the excellence of it all.\"Dr. Terence S.

His legacy as Dean extends far beyond the many students,staff, and faculty who have madeVanderbilt home to encompass asteadfast dedication to the impor-tance of teaching and learning inmedicine and science. Whether inthe classroom, laboratory or clinic,Dean Chapman set the standardfor service to others through aninsatiable pursuit of excellence. Hewill be fondly remembered by thewords he guided us by as Dean:\"Artus longus, vita brevis, the artis long, the life is short.\" Dr. David Harley, president of the VUSM Class of 2000, resident inSurgery at Vanderbilt UniversityHospital \"I remember the time when he first spoke to us, when he told us that asVanderbilt medical students, we wereprivileged. He said that we were hisforemost priority, and that the facultyand administration were here for us,not vice-versa. He said that if we everneeded him, for any reason, he wouldstop what he was doing and answerour call. As first-year students foreignto the daunting world of medicine, wewere officially welcomed into theVanderbilt medical family by itsfather figure. For his commitment tous, we owe a great debt of gratitude.\"Dr. Harry R. Jacobson, vice-chan- cellor for Health Affairs, VUMC \"John Chapman is truly a giant of medical education.

Chapman acknowledges a standing ovation at the recog- nition ceremony for the Class of 2000.DANA JOHNSONV page 15Fall 2000 Dr. G. Canby Robinson Dean 1920-1928 In the quarter century following 1895, the school has two deans: William L. Dudley, until 1913, followed by Lucius E. Burch in 1920. Dr. Burch continued as acting dean until 1925 while dean-elect G. Canby Robinson planned the school'snew program and physical plant. Robinson's plans were the essence of a Flexnerian medical center with hospital, laboratories, and school facil-ities under one roof. It was regarded as the best arranged medical school and hospital combina- tion in the United States. He resigned to become dean of Cornell University and died in 1960. Dr. John W. Patterson Dean 1958-1962 Dr. Patterson came to Vanderbilt in 1958 from the University of British Columbia where he wasdean. During his tenure at Vanderbilt, the med-ical center expanded 50 percent in size andimproved its financial position. He resigned in1962, to become, for a year, professor of physi-ology, then moved to the University of Connecticut.Dr. Randolph Batson Dean 1963-1972 Dr. Batson was the first of the School of Medicine's own graduates to be named Dean. He joined the faculty in 1944, two years afterreceiving his medical degree and presided over a decade of growth. Noted also for his fundraising, his influence brought about the donation of pri- vate monies from Dr. Rudolph A. Light that made possible the construction of Rudolph A.Light Hall for Medical Education. Dr. Batson is professor emeritus of pediatrics.Dr. John E. Chapman Dean 1975-present During his tenure as dean, the medical faculty has more than doubled, as has the research pro- gram. Its academic program has been boosted bythe addition of numerous buildings on the med - ical center campus. Dean Chapman's hallmark has been to give individual attention to each med- ical student's personal needs and educational pro- gram and to the research needs of the faculty.Dr. Waller S. Leathers Dean 1928-1945 Leathers, who continued as chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine and Public Health, was one of the first physicians nationallyinvolved in the attempts to combat disease by pre - ventive measures. At Vanderbilt he emphasized curriculum devoted to preventive medicine and public health. He retired in 1945 and died in 1946.Dr. Ernest W. Goodpasture Dean 1945-1950 A research pathologist and dedicated academi- cian, Goodpasture placed a strong emphasis on research activities. He resigned as dean to returnto full-time teaching and research in pathology. He was professor of Pathology from 1924 until 1955. He died in 1960.Dr. John B. Youmans Dean 1950-1958 Internationally renowned for his research in nutrition, Youmans was appointed dean in 1950. He emphasized patient care and research andsolidified relationships with the Nashville Academy of Medicine and other community groups. He resigned in 1958 to become head of medical research for the Army. He died in 1979. thedeans of VUSM page 16Fall 2000 A oftraditionexcellenceTheir names ar e the ones that ar e familiar - they're on portraits, conference rooms, and textbooks at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.Their contributions to Vanderbilt UniversitySchool of Medicine and to medicine and sci-ence, in general, ar e incalculable. They ar e the legends of VUSM, those teachers and researchers who hav e helped VUSM earn the reputation it holds today. VUSM celebrates its 125th anniv ersary this year. The first diplomas issued by a newly organ- ized Vanderbilt University were to 61 doctors of medicine in F ebruary 1875. In honor of this milestone, a list of the leg- ends of VUSM has been compiled for Vanderbilt Medicine. All of the researchers selected for this article are members of a National Academy (National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine), or are recipients of the Nobel Prize or Sutherland Prize (Vanderbilt's highest research award).Many of the teachers included have won teaching awards, but it is their unique styles ofteaching - some intimidating, some endearing -that brought about their selection for this article. Only faculty members who are not actively participating in teaching or research at the med- ical center today ar e included in this list. S ome have died. Some are emeritus faculty. But all have left permanent imprints on Vanderbilt University School of M edicine, one of the most respected medical schools in the world. Upcoming issues of Vanderbilt Medicine will highlight the outstanding teachers and researchers of today. by Nancy Humphrey and Leigh MacMillanV page 17Fall 2000 xcellence page 18Fall 2000 A Blalock R. Harrison (1900-1978) VUSM faculty years (1925-1941) They are often called the \"dynamic duo\" of the early years of Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. Drs. AlfredBlalock and Tinsley Harrison were room - mates at Johns Hopkins and came toVanderbilt in 1925 asthe first chief residents inSurgery and Medicine.Blalock is known for hispioneering research onthe nature and treatmentof hemorrhagic and trau - matic shock, and is credited with saving thelives of many casualties during World WarII, and with the first open heart operationfor tetralogy of Fallot (blue baby). But histeaching techniques also set him apart. \"He was entirely dedicated to the edu- cation of students and residents,\" says Dr.Walter H. Merrill, professor of Cardiac andThoracic Surgery at VUMC. \"He talked alot over the years about his real joy in life -working with residents. He liked to givepositive reinforcement. He was courtly and courteous.\" Harrison, wasthe author of Harrison'sPrinciples of InternalMedicine, one of the major textbooks in internal medicine. His lectures were \"excit-ing,\" according to a tribute written by thelate Dr. Addison B. Scoville Jr. of VUMC. \"He made heart sounds come alive. The 'lub-dub' he mimicked was accentuat-ed by screeches and whistles so that youcould actually visualize the heart valve puck-ering up or opening wide...He would notmake a correct diagnosis on rounds. He would send us scurrying to the library to prove he was wrong. Invariably we foundout he had a method to his madness andthis was a superb way of getting us to knowthe library and making us think.\" Dr. Thomas E. Brittingham (1924-1986) VUSM faculty years (1963-1980) The key to the suc- cess of Dr. Thomas Brittingham's teachingwasn't as much what hetaught but how hetaught it, said Dr. JohnS. Sergent, MD'66,HS'70,'71, now professor of Medicine and chief medical officer of the Vanderbilt Medical Group. \"His success was in the way he taught and the challenge he threw down to us, toalways be skeptical, to follow our owninstincts and to really get to know ourpatients,\" Sergent said. His Saturday morning patient confer - ences for third-year students are legendary. \"He would invariably work up the patientfar better than we did, sometimes going toextraordinary extremes,\" said Sergent, thefirst recipient of Vanderbilt's BrittinghamAward for clinical teaching. He might call agrandparent or go to another hospital andlook up medical records.\"You felt like you were working in a goldfish bowl when you worked with Dr.Brittingham,\" Sergent said. \"He created anenvironment so detailed in his knowledge ofhis patients, that he made everybody try torise to that level.\" Brittingham, who kept a framed letter on his wall from the Dean of HarvardMedical School telling him his career was injeopardy, rarely took vacations, made house calls, and gave his patients his home phone number. \"I knew him to buy firewood andhelp out with the rent for two of his patients,\"Sergent said. Dr. Barney Brooks (1884-1952) VUSM faculty years ( 1925-1951) There's an urban legend about the surgical rounds of Dr.Barney Brooks that's oftentold to medical school classes. It may not betrue but the story adequately represents theeffect he had on students. Brooks, in his intimidating, jerky voice, supposedly asked a third-year stu-dent, called down from his seat during oneof Brooks' Tuesday morning amphitheaterclinics, what type of diet to recommend fora patient unable to absorb foods. The stu-dent replied \"sweet potatoes,\" only to havethe bald-headed, face, \"sweet potatoes?!\" The stu-dent reportedly fainted. \"He was admired. Not everybody loved him, but he had everybody's respect. Hetaught in a very structured, strict andauthoritative manner. Students were in aweof him, but they were somewhat fearful ofhis presence,\" says Dr. Irwin B. Eskind, Fall 2000 page 19MD'48, HS'51. Brooks loved talking with patients during his teaching rounds.Farmers and farmer's wives were among hisfavorite patients. He sometimes spent classtime discussing farm life, crops or theweather with the patient. When Dr. Harris D. Riley, Jr., MD'48, HS'50, professor of Pediatrics, wasa third-year student, Brooks told one ofRiley's patients that he would need surgery the following morning. The patient told Brooks he would have to obtain the permis-sion of his physician, Dr. Riley. Brookscalled a terrified Riley, who was convincedhis medical career was over, into a studentlaboratory. Instead Brooks told Riley, \"I amdeeply gratified at what we have just wit - nessed. That a student has established sucha relationship with his patient pleases megreatly.\" Riley said he recalls little afterthose two sentences. Dr. Amos U. Christie (1902-1986) VUSM faculty years (1943-1986) Dr. Amos Christie may be best known for his research in histo - plasmosis but he's alsofondly remembered atVUSM for his unortho-dox teaching practices. He rarely used lectures, never quite finishedhis sentences and didn't really worry aboutwhether he pronounced his words correctly.But he taught students to be consummateclinicians, compassionate, and knowledge-able in all areas of pediatrics. \"He taught us by example that to weep over a dying child is acceptable no matterhow big or tough we may think we are,\" saidDr. Robert Merrill, MD'49,HS'49,'50,'53,'54. \"He taught us to blamered eyes and moisture on the common cold. Some of us still do that.\" Christie is known for integrating the Vanderbilt Hospital children's ward fiveyears before the U. S. Supreme Court madeit mandatory. \"It was done in the interest of patient care. There was no committee, no permis-sion granted, no authority vested and nopublicity. It was just done by executive decree. I call that administration.\" Dr. Jack Davies (1919-1991) VUSM faculty years (1963-1989) Dr. Jack Davies once said thisabout teaching:\"I want it to befun. If it's notfun, it's no good. I think teaching is a gift...Ilearn something every time, every day.\" Dr. Jeanette J. Norden, professor of Cell Biology and a colleague and friend ofthe former professor and chair of anatomy,said Davies was \"one of a kind.\" Davies had an outrageous sense of humor, knew Greek and Latin, was wellversed in the classics and had an outstand-ing artistic ability. He could draw withboth hands. He had an \"unbelievableknowledge of how the body was puttogether,\" Norden says. \"Most of all, he loved students. He loved gross anatomy and knew how tocommunicate both the knowledge and hislove of the subject to the students in a realand meaningful way. He could take stu-dents and teach them the wonders of thehuman body with enthusiasm and awe,year after year. Dr. James R. Dawson Jr. (1908-1986) VUSM faculty years (1938-1949) Dr. James R. Dawson, who taught the school's sec-ond-year pathology course,endeared himself to students byhis bluntness, said Dr. Fred Allison,MD'46, HS'46. \"He was very quick to say what he thought and if he told you something, heexpected you to remember it,\" Allison said.\"He didn't call on students very much, butif he did, you'd better hope you knew theanswer to his question.\" Dawson left Vanderbilt in 1949 to become professor and chair of Pathology atthe University of Minnesota. He was influ - enced during his early years at Vanderbilt byDr. Ernest T. Goodpasture and developed astrong interest in virology, especially viral dis-eases of the central nervous system. \"Behind all of that fierceness, he was a hard working, wonderful person with agreat sense of humor. He was very currentand knew the research literature. He gen-uinely liked medical students. He scaredyou to death in class, but when class wasover, he was a different person, smiling andjoking with you.\" Dr. J. William Hillman (1921-1970) VUSM faculty years (1952-1970) Dr. J. William Hillman had a \"genuine interest\" inhis patients, a traitthat was transmittedto students and residents, said Dr. Robert page 20Fall 2000 A oftraditionexcellence D. Collins, John L. Shapiro professor of Pathology. \"He was committed to his patients' wel- fare. He showed students and residents how it was possible for an individual doctor tomake a difference in people's lives,\" Collinssaid. Hillman was relentless in his work ethic. Within six years of his arrival atVanderbilt, he had become professor and head of orthopaedics, then a section of gen- eral surgery. In 1962, he convinced Dean John W. Patterson to establish anautonomous Department of Orthopaedicsand Rehabilitation. After his death, studentsdeveloped the Hillman Award, a teachingaward, given to a member of the housestaffwith the greatest interest in the education ofmedical students. Chancellor Alexander Heard once called Hillman \"a premier member of theVanderbilt faculty . . . We had none betterand I know of no one who gave more of hislife selflessly and without limit to help others.\" Dr. Rudolph H. Kampmeier (1898-1990) VUSM faculty years (1936-1963) World War II took its toll on Vanderbilt's Department of Medicine in the early 1940s. Dr. Rudolph H. Kampmeier, by himself, held it together while all other faculty members were serving their country during the war. \"He was able to effectively use friend- ships with practitioners in Nashville to keepthe department running,\" Collins said. Kampmeier, who taught the physical diagnosis course for second-year students, waswell known for his ability to get information from a patient and how to analyze what theinformation meant. He also excelled at thedynamics of physical examinations andpatient histories. \"He routinely figured outwhere and what the problems were by palpa-tion or auscultation,\" Collins said. \"Dr. Kampmeier was the master of the patient history, of getting information that isoften locked inside the patient.\" Chancellor Emeritus Harvie Branscomb said that Kampmeier's \"warm and friendlyspirit\" made it a privilege to know him. \"ForRudy Kampmeier, medicine was more than acareer, it was a vocation he served withunflagging devotion.\" Dr. Barton McSwain (1906-1981) VUSM faculty years (1946-1981) Barton McSwain, MD'30, was an expert in surgical patholo-gy and knew the humanbody like few others. Butwhat set McSwain apartfrom other experts inpathology was that he had enormous clinicalexperience. McSwain, the third of four generations to graduate from VUSM, taught the surgicalpathology course to third-year medical studentsand was well known for his energy. He deliv-ered a once-a-week, three-hour lecture in a 55-seat lecture hall with no break. \"He would talk without notes,\" Collins said. He had a well-organized presentation ofdisease from the standpoint of surgery. Hispresentations were lucid and well organized.He could pull together enormous amounts ofnew material as well as provide reinforcementfor the material the students learned as sec-ond-year pathology students.\"Dr. John L. Shapiro (1915-1983) VUSM faculty years (1948-1980) Dr. Clifton K. Meador, MD'55, HS'59, believes that Dr. John L. Shapiro scared students into learning. \"It was awesome. Hetaught by com- plete fear. It was the mosteffective use ofthe technique I've ever seen. He genuinelywanted you to learn the material and if you did-n't, he would tell you about it. Meador said that Shapiro, who was appointed professor and chairman of theDepartment of Pathology in 1956, was knownto curse, shake his head, stamp his feet or justleave the classroom in disgust if a question wasanswered wrong in his second-year pathologycourse. \"He wasn't acting. He was truly disgusted. Sometimes I think he was really mad at himselffor not getting through to you. \"You were terrified of him, yet you weren't. You wanted to please him morethan anything. I had enormous respect forthis man.\" Meador said that a legendary Shapiro story tells of a medical student who lost all 20feet of intestine while washing it in a sink.\"What am I going to tell the old SOB,\" thestudent asked, not knowing that Shapiro hadjust entered the room. \"I'm not old,\" Shapirotold the shocked student. page 21Fall 2000 the Researchers Sidney P. Colowick, Ph.D. (1916-1985) VUSM faculty years (1959-1985) In a memorial tribute to Sidney P. Colowick, Ph.D., his friend and colleague Nathan O. Kaplan,Ph.D.,describedhim as\"the - was the American Cancer Society-Charles Hayden Foundation Professorof Microbiology, is known principally for hiswork on an enzyme called hexokinase and theregulation of sugar transport in cultured animalcells. He made fundamental contributions tounderstanding how cells derive energy from themetabolism of carbohydrates and the enzymesinvolved in the early steps of sugar metabolism. Together with Kaplan, he planned and edited the first six volumes of Methods inEnzymology, launching in 1955 what became aseries of well-known and useful handbooks. Colowick joined the Vanderbilt faculty as an American Cancer Society Professor withresearch support from the society until the endof his career. With Dr. Rollo Park, Colowickattracted Dr. Earl Sutherland and other out-standing scientists to Vanderbilt, establishingthe institution as a world leader in the field ofregulatory biology. Colowick was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1972.Dr. Ernest W. Goodpasture (1886-1960) VUSM faculty years (1924-1960) Viruses and chicken eggs made Dr. Ernest W. Goodpasture famous. In1931, Goodpasture,professor of Pathology,developed the firstpractical method forcultivating large quanti - ties of a virus in the lab- oratory\u2014by growing it in the exposed membrane of achick embryo. \"It revolutionized the study of viruses and viral diseases,\" said Collins, one ofGoodpasture's students. \"Scientists from all overthe world came here to learn the technique.\" The method opened the door for research that probed the nature of viruses and led to thedevelopment of vaccines to protect against viraldiseases. Goodpasture was most proud of his dis- covery of the cause of mumps, which hadeluded investigators since ancient times. In aseries of experiments using monkeys, heproved the viral nature of the disease. Goodpasture was one of the first choices in a drive to expand the School of Medicine facul - ty to one distinguished in American medical education and research. Among his many hon-ors, Goodpasture was elected to the NationalAcademy of Sciences in 1937 and the AmericanPhilosophical Society in 1943.Lubomir S. Hnilica, Ph.D. (1929-1986) VUSM faculty years (1975-1986) Lubomir S. Hnilica, Ph.D., was considered an international authority on the effects of chemical carcinogens on nuclear proteins,before he died in 1986. He made many basicpioneering observations related to the biochem-istry of chromosomal proteins. His early work focused on the chromoso- mal proteins called histones and laid the foun - dation for the purification of histone proteins inlarge quantities for further characterization.Hnilica's research suggested that cancer-causingchemicals change the nature and amount of his-tone proteins, revealing the site where cancercells suffer DNA damage. Hnilica, professor of Biochemistry and Mary Geddes Stahlman Professor of CancerResearch, was also interested in other non-his - tone chromosomal proteins and their changesduring chemical carcinogenesis and sponta - neous human malignancies. Hnilica served as the Associate Director for Research for the Vanderbilt UniversityCancer Research and Treatment Center\u2014thepredecessor of today's Vanderbilt-IngramCancer Center. the Research in1986. page 22Fall 2000 A Grant W. Liddle (1921-1989) VUSM faculty years (1956-1989) An inherited form of hypertension, pseudoaldosteronism,today is called Liddle'ssyndrome in honor ofthe man who first char-acterized the disease anddiscovered that it could becontrolled with medication. Dr. Grant W. Liddle, professor of Medicine and chair of Medicine from 1968 to1983, was internationally recognized for hispioneering research in clinical endocrinology. Focusing especially on the physiology of the pituitary and adrenal glands, he was able toclarify the role of the pituitary in Cushing's dis-ease, and he developed improved methods forthe treatment of the disease. He discovered thatnon-endocrine sites could produce the hor-mone ACTH (ectopic ACTH syndrome),causing Cushing's syndrome. Liddle show that metyrapone, an adrenal enzyme inhibitor, sup - presses com-pensatory increase in pituitary gland ACTHsecretion. He used the finding to devise practi-cal tests of pituitary and adrenal gland function. He was also the first to study the aldos - terone antagonist, spironolactone, which pro- motes sodium loss and is clinically useful totreat effects of aldosteronism like edema andhypertension. Liddle received Vanderbilt's Sutherland Prize in 1979 and became a member of theNational Academy of Sciences in 1981.Dr. Earl W. Sutherland Jr. (1915-1974) VUSM faculty years (1963-1973) Dr. Earl W. Sutherland opened the black box that concealed the secrets of hor- mone action. In studying how adrenalinecauses liver cellsto convert glyco- gen to glucose, Sutherland dis-covered a previ - ously unknown substance\u2014cyclic AMP\u2014that occurred as an intermediate in the process. Sutherland, professor of Physiology, pro - posed a general scheme for hormone action inwhich hormones interact with receptors on thecell surface. These receptors, he contended,then pass the signal along to an enzyme thatmanufactures cyclic AMP intracellularly whereit activates He called cyclic AMP the \"secondmessenger\" (the hormone was the first messen - ger). His scheme, now including multiple dif - ferent \"second messenger\" compounds,remains an accurate description of how hor - mones work. Sutherland became a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1966 andwon the 1971 Nobel Prize in Physiology orMedicine for \"his discoveries concerning themechanisms of the action of Stanley Cohen, Ph.D. (1922- ) VUSM faculty Stanley Cohen, Ph.D. injected sali- vary gland extract into newborn mice, he noticed a strange acceleration of develop-ment\u2014their eyes opened and teeth eruptedearlier than usual. This keen observation ledCohen to discover the substance epidermalgrowth factor (EGF), so named because it stimu-lated the growth ofepithelial cells in thecornea and skin. Cohen had previ- ously, with Rita Levi-Montalcini, isolated anerve growth factor(NGF) that she had discovered in certain mouse tumors. The two shared the 1986 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their \"dis-coveries of growth factors.\" Cohen's isolation of EGF and determina- tion of its amino acid sequence provided scien-tists for the first time with a factor that allowedstudies of the cell growth process. Cohen con - tinued to study EGF, its interaction with cellsurface receptors, and the intracellular signalingpathways activated by the growth factor. Cohen's work laid the foundation for the study of growth factors and the mechanismsregulating the growth and survival of cells, ofcritical importance to cancer research. Cohen, now Distinguished Professor of Biochemistry, Emeritus, received Vanderbilt'sSutherland Prize in 1977, was elected to theNational Academy of Sciences in 1980, andreceived both the Nobel Prize and the AlbertLasker Basic Medical Research Award in 1986. William J. Darby, M.D., Ph.D. (1913- ) VUSM faculty years (1944-present) Not many biochemists have the opportu - nity to conduct research all over the world. But Dr. William J. Darby, an interna-tionally renowned expert in nutritional science,traveled around the globe to conduct studiesthat have shaped international nutrition educa-tion and assistance programs. Darby, currentlyprofessor of Biochemistry, Emeritus, served aschair of the department from 1949-1971. page 23Darby's early research with Dr. Paul L. Day led to the discovery of vitamin M, nowcalled folic acid, and his subsequent studiesdefined the roles of folic acid, Vitamin C, andVitamin B12 in metabolism. Darby and his col- leagues at Vanderbiltwere the first to demon-strate the ability of folicacid to combat the ane- mia and gastrointestinal dysfunction in tropicalsprue. A Vanderbiltstudy evaluating the nutritional status ofinfants, children, and pregnant women set thestandards for assessing nutritional status and ledto a series of nutritional surveys all over theworld. Some of Darby's global research included studies in the Middle East and Africa thatdefined zinc deficiency and characterized theeffects of parasites on nutrition. The application of Darby's research and his personal involvement in advisory commit - tees has influenced all of the major national andinternational agencies that have responsibilitiesin nutrition. Darby became a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1972. Dr. Charles R. \"Rollo\" Park (1916- ) VUSM faculty years (1952-present) Dr. Charles once said inan interview thathe thought hismain contribu-tion to Vanderbilt was putting together adepartment focused on the study of metabolicproblems, particularly diabetes, that in its con-centration of effort and interest has \"trainedmany people who are well-known in diabetes circles.\" Park, now Professor of Physiology, Emeritus, was chair of Physiology from 1952to 1984, is no stranger in diabetes circles. Hiscareer-long studies of carbohydrate metabo-lism, insulin action, and glucose utilization havegreatly contributed to knowledge about dia-betes. Park demonstrated that insulin acts by promoting the transport of glucose (sugar) across the muscle cell membrane, and he subse-quently found evidence for both an insulinreceptor site and a glucose carrier site in the cellmembrane. With colleagues at Vanderbilt, Park devel - oped quantitative analytical methods to meas - ure the various substances produced during glu-cose metabolism. They were the first to identi-fy the role of the hormone glucagon in stimu-lating gluconeogenesis\u2014the production of glu - cose by the liver. Park is credited with the selection of Vanderbilt University for the establishment ofthe first Diabetes and Endocrinology ResearchCenter in 1973. He was elected to the NationalAcademy of Sciences in 1980 and awardedVanderbilt's Sutherland Prize in 1984. *Special thanks to Mary Teloh, special collections librarian, Eskind Biomedical Library, for provid-ing historical data and photographs. Dr. Walter M. Morgan III is con- tinuing the history of a long-time family association withVanderbilt University School ofMedicine. Morgan, assistant profes - sor of Pediatric Surgery, is thegreat-great grandson of Dr.William Henry Morgan, the firstgraduate of the newly consti-tuted Vanderbilt University.The first diplomas issued thatyear by Vanderbilt were to 61 doctors of medicine in 1875. Morgan's name was calledfirst. The Morgan's association with VUSM continued. William Henry Morgan's grandson, Walter Morgan Sr., was on the dental surgery fac-ulty from 1930-1956. Morgan Sr.'s first cousin, Dr. Hugh Morgan, was a long-time(1925-1961) professor of Medicine at VUSM.Continuing the TraditionContinuing the Tradition VDANA JOHNSON Fall 2000 page 24It was a journey worth taking. There's no doubt about that. But the results weren't what they had hoped.Justin and Dana Piasecki, identical twins and Vanderbilt medical students, took leave during their second year of medical school, trying to make the kayaking team for the 2000Olympics in Sydney, Australia. The two raced separately and together in the Olympic Trials, held in Seattle in June, missing the qualification cut-off only by inches in a couple of instances. The competitionwas fierce, says Justin Piasecki. \"We were extremely well prepared, focused and ready to race but as is the case in any sport, sometimes, despite all that, the outcomes don't always turn out the way you hadhoped.

I've always believed that experiences either build character or reveal it. It's beena most remarkable experience going after this dream and we feel so lucky to have had theopportunity to go for it,\" Justin said. \"The Olympics would have been icing on the cake, but even without that, the cake was pretty good too. We feel most fortunate for the lessons we've learned about ourselves and theconfidence and courage we've gained along this journey. We feel so grateful to Vanderbiltfor supporting us.

The 11th annual assessment of health care facilities, called \"America's Best Hospitals,\"ranks institutions by 17 different specialties. Vanderbilt University Hospital and The Vanderbilt Clinic are ranked in 11 of the 17specialty areas surveyed, including cancer,27th; digestive 19th; disorders,15th; and urology, 18th. This is the first yearthat kidney disease has been ranked as a spe-cialty. The annual ranking of health care facilities is designed to serve as a guide for consumerseach year. To be eligible for ranking in any of the 17 specialties, a hospital had to meet at least oneof three requirements \u2014 affiliation with amedical school, membership in the Council ofTeaching Hospitals or a minimum of nine outof 17 key technologies readily available.looking for the best in medical care. This year's complete guide is published in thenewsmagazine's July 17 issue and can also beaccessed on-line at www.usnews.com. \"We are very pleased that, once again, VUMC is ranked among the best in the coun-try and that the number of specialty areas inwhich we're recognized continues to grow,\"said Dr. Harry R. Jacobson, vice chancellor forHealth Affairs. \"While this is only one indicatorof quality when comparing providers ofhealth care services, national recognitionsuch as this is important in reaching our goalof being regarded as one of the country's pre-miere academic medical institutions.\" The rankings use a statistical method developed by the National Opinion ResearchCenter (NORC), a noted social scienceresearch group at the University of Chicago,to rank the quality of the nation's hospitals VUMC ranks among nation's elite by Doug Campbell by Leigh MacMillan Fall 2000 page 26 lifeFall 2000 page 27It has been called the \"Book of Life,\" but this is one book that may not make it to the New York Times Bestseller List. At three bil-lion letters, with no spaces or punctuation, the sequence of the human genome isn't exactly a page-turner. But it promises to revolutionize medicine and improvehuman health with the wealth of information it contains. Right now, estimates on the total number of human genes vary widely, from 40,000 to 120,000. Scientists plan to use the sequence of the human genome to identify all of the genes, whichwill serve as a launching pad for more difficult studies of what each gene does - under normal cir - cumstances, and for some genes, during disease. At the end of June, the leaders of two rival groups of scientists\u2014the publicly funded consor- tium known as the Human Genome Project and the company Celera Genomics\u2014announcedtogether that they had effectively decoded the entire human genome. Data acquired by the public consortium is freely available on the World Wide Web. Celera Genomics offers subscription-only access to its databases of genomic information and powerfulcomputing tools, and Vanderbilt University was the first academic institution to partner withCelera Genomics for access to the company's vast resources. The agreement between Vanderbilt University and Celera is designed to protect academic free - dom, ensuring that Vanderbilt's own inventions and discoveries can be used to advance patient care and treatment. Under the agreement, Vanderbilt can: publish and present its research results; develop intel- lectual property based on its discoveries; use Celera information in filing or prosecuting patent applications and maintaining patents; and use Celera information in filing and maintaining regula-tory applications and approvals. \"We are extremely pleased to be at the leading edge of efforts to harness the potential of these data,\" said Dr. Harry R. Jacobson, vice chancellor for Health Affairs, when the agreement wassigned in May. \"We believe this will be a powerful tool in the ongoing quest to expand our base ofa newchapter in the ofbook by Leigh MacMillan facility, the third largest in the world, to access the databases and bioinformaticstools for viewing, browsing, and analyzingthe genomic information. \"By partnering with Celera, we put ourselves at the forefront of the genomicsfield,\" said Dr. Mark A. Magnuson, assis-tant vice chancellor for Research, who alongwith Lee E. Limbird, Ph.D., associate vicechancellor for Research, and George M.Stadler, director of Enterprise Developmentin the Office of Technology Transfer,worked with Celera to develop the terms forpartnership between an academic institu- tion and Celera. Unlocking the secrets of the genome promises to revolutionize the practice ofmedicine. \"Within five years, I believe there are going to be great strides in bringing thepower of genetics and the wealth of newinformation from the Human GenomeProject directly to the benefit of patients,\"said Dr. Alfred L. George, Jr., Grant W.Liddle Professor of Medicine and directorof the division of Genetic Medicine. Those strides will likely include improved diagnosis of disease, earlier detec - tion of genetic susceptibility to disease, indi- vidually customized drug treatments,rational drug design, and new DNA-baseddrugs (gene therapy). To apply genomic data to medical care, scientists will search for genetic differencesbetween individuals, many of which takescientific knowledge and apply it to discov- ering new ways to combat illness.\" J. Craig Venter, Ph.D., Celera's presi- dent and chief scientific officer, agreed. \"It is very fitting that our first academ- ic database subscription is with a premiermedical and research institution such asVanderbilt. We firmly believe thatresearchers everywhere should have access toour genomic database information and nowwith the launch of our web-based sciencediscovery system, we have made it easier todo so,\" Venter said. Since May, the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, University of Cincinnati, and Ohio State University have also signed subscription agreementswith Celera. Celera is an information company whose goal is to make the rising volumes ofbiological information more accessible anduseful to researchers. It is creating an unparalleled library of genomic information in databases, whichinclude the human genome, genetic varia-tions in the fly)genome. Celera's databases bothsequence and annotation\u2014theidentification of genes and description oftheir functions. Celera has also amassed powerful com- puting tools, which are necessary to handlethe volumes of genomic data. Subscribersare able to log into Celera's supercomputingthe form of a single letter change\u2014an A instead of a T, for example. Single-letterchanges are called SNPs (pronounced\"snips\") for \"single nucleotide polymor-phisms.\" Scientists plan to find SNPs and link them to diseases and variability in drugresponse. Genetic tests looking at SNPs, for example, could help predict a patient's riskfor developing coronary artery disease. Apredicted high risk might indicate an earlyneed for drugs or other treatments to reduce the need for bypass operations. Genetic tests related to drug response could indicate that a particular drug willwork for a certain patient at half the usualdose, allowing a customized prescriptionthat avoids potential side effects associatedwith higher doses. Or the test might revealthat the patient will not respond at all,allowing the physician to select an alternatedrug immediately, rather than after weeksof treatment. As scientists unravel the functions of each gene, we can expect greater under-standing of both normal and disease physi - ology, leading ultimately to preventive ther-apies, better treatments, and even cures,George said.

Dr. Charles J. Wray becamethe last of 3,317 students to receive his diplomafrom Dean John E. Chapman. Dr. Chapmanannounced a year ago that he would step down asDean as soon as his replacement is in place. Atthat time he will assume the position of ViceChancellor for Medical Alumni Affairs. In completing his 25thyear as Dean, Dr. Chapman has conferred medical degrees on67% of all living VUSM graduates, certainly an exemplary record. Forty graduate students also participated in the graduation exercises and received Doctor of Philosophy degrees in biomedicalsciences. On average, these students require over five years to com-plete requirements for the Ph.D. degree and they are critical to theresearch program of the University.

Vanderbilt Medicine garners national award page 36Fall 2000 lookingbackCRSTHE CANBY ROBINSON SOCIETY SPECIAL SECTION \"When great events occur in the history of human institu-tions, they are found, almostwithout exception, to be associ - ated with unusual individuals.Such a one was G. CanbyRobinson.\" - Charles Sidney Burwell, M.D. The Vanderbilt University School of Medicinewas born in 1875. But it was reborn in 1925 withthe opening of theVanderbiltUniversity Hospital, an act ofvision, will and determina - tion wrought by G. Canby Robinson, the Dean of theSchool of Medicine from1920 to 1928. This one manchanged the direction of American medical education and set the stage for 75 yearsof remarkable progress thathas made Vanderbilt one of the nation's premier cen-ters of medical education, research and clinical care. No wonder then, in 1978, when a small group ofpeople got together with theidea of furthering theMedical Center's mission,they took their name andtheir guiding spirit from G.Canby Robinson. Foundedto build the community lead-ership needed to garner phil-anthropic support, theCanby Robinson Society hasgrown from just over 100members at its founding tomore than 1,500 memberstoday. The CRS allows mem - bers to become personally acquainted with the peopleand programs at Vanderbilt.Faculty, students and staffprovide tours, acquaintmembers with new projects and share their pride in newdevelopments. The CRS also promotes both unrestricted andrestricted giving in supportof the Medical Center.Unrestricted gifts support theMedical School's financialaid programs. Restricted giftssupport a department, pro-gram or project within themedical center. This generos- ity attracts promising indi- viduals who will become out-standing physicians and fur- thers the opportunities for the Medical Center to con-tinue to benefit humanhealth. Last year, members of the CRS gave more than $20million in gifts to theMedical Center. With a deepcommitment to students, theSociety has funded the fulltuition of 26 scholars since1991 through the unrestrict-ed gifts of its members. Thisyear the CRS will begin tobuild a $50 million scholar-ship endowment - anamount sufficient to offerevery student that enters ascholarship. Like every good philan- thropic society, the CRSpublished a periodical tokeep its members informedof its activities and goals. The CRS Magazine , our quarterly publication formembers, has served that rolequite well. But the time hascome to bring the mission ofthe Society to a broader audi-ence beyond Nashville toinclude the alumni of theSchool of Medicine and oth- ers. Look for the Canby Robinson Society to be a regular feature of VanderbiltMedicine. We look forwardto bringing you more about the CRS in each issue. Robert E. McNeilly Jr. President, Canby Robinson Society THE CANBY VISION CRSANNE RAYNER page 37Fall 2000 With a single, unexpected phone call, his medical career was transformed before he even set foot in medical school. JohnZic was in his Notre Dame dorm roomwhen the call came. On the other endof the phone was Dr. Gerald S.Gotterer, associate dean of theVanderbilt University School ofMedicine, calling with good news.\"You've been selected to receive a full,four-year scholarship to Vanderbiltmedical school,\" he told John. That was in 1987. Thirteen years later, Dr. John A. Zic, assistant profes-sor of Medicine (Dermatology) atVUMC, says the Canby RobinsonSociety Scholarship has had far-reach - ing implications for his career. \"It dramatically changed my life because it made a Vanderbilt medicaleducation an attainable goal by knock-ing down any financial barriers in theway,\" he said. \"The impact of the four-year scholarship lasted into my residencywhen I made a decision to pursue anacademic career over a more lucrativeprivate practice career in dermatology.I would imagine that a substantiallyhigher debt burden could have swayedme away from academia.\" The CRS aids and honors medical students by giving four-year, full tuitionscholarships each year, awarded on thebasis of demonstrated leadership andscholarship activities. The dean and thechairman of the admissions committeerecommend scholarship recipients, andtheir recommendations are then for - warded to the CRS awards committeefor final selection by the committeeboard members. CRS scholar, Allan Moore, a sec - ond-year VUSM student, said the\"As I work in the hospital, I realize that it takes a whole community tomake possible all the wonderful thingsthat go on at Vanderbilt from day today: learning, teaching, discovering,and healing. The spirit of service, com-munity, and generosity of the CanbyRobinson Society is truly unique. It hasmade my Vanderbilt experience every - thing I hoped for and more. I amdeeply grateful.\"award is more than just money. \"While the scholarship is a major financial award, it is a lot more thanthat,\" Moore said. \"It's a family atmos-phere. More than the money, it is afeeling of inclusion.\" The scholarship allows incoming first-year student, Erik Musiek, anopportunity to pursue his dream ofentering the M.D./Ph.D. program atVanderbilt. Chosen to be the Faye andJoe B. Wyatt CRS scholar, Erik is thefirst student in the combined programto receive the scholarship. Musiek'swife, Amy, is also a first-year medicalstudent. Fourth-year medical student Yen- Lin Chen worked many part time jobsto help pay for college: from dishwash-ing in the freshman dining hall, tomaintaining 500 culture vials ofmutant fruit flies, to teaching in sum-mer camps. \"To be given a four-year,full-tuition scholarship was simplybeyond my wildest dreams. Not onlyhas it relieved me of the tremendousburden of a large medical school debt,it has also served as a source of inspira-tion for me throughout medicalschool,\" she said.
