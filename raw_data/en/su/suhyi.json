Directed by and starring Nanni Moretti. (speaking foreign language) This film is somewhat in the form of a filmed diary, the very subject of which is the convergence of cinema and life. It's exuberant and funny, but it's hardy humor and cinematic convention are shadowed by the proximity of death. (salsa music) The movie is in three parts. In the first, On My Vespa, Moretti tools around Rome, giving free range to his musings, his curiosities, and his fantasies. In the second, Islands, Moretti shows himself getting to work on a screenplay. His work materials are a pile of odd press clippings that he has collected over the course of the years and in order to get to work, he travels with his friend Gerardo, an idiosyncratic and ernest intellectual, to the island of Lipari for a little peace and quiet. But those travels soon turn comical and distracting. Gerardo, a James Joyce scholar who epudiates the effluvia of media modernity, sees TV for the first time in 30 years and becomes an instant addict. (speaking foreign language) As they go from island to island in search of a good working environment, Gerardo drags his new obsession along with him. It takes on a particularly riotous and cinema-centric satirical aspect when the two friends turn up on the island of Stromboli, the volcanic island which is both the title and the setting of Roberto Rossellini's great 1959 drama, the first that he filmed with Ingrid Bergman. Moretti and Gerardo climb arduously to exalted ground, near the summit of the volcano, a place where in Rossellini's film, Bergman's character experiences a spiritual transfiguration. But now in the company of Moretti, Gerardo, seeing American tourists in the vicinity, sends his friend downhill on a mission of another sort of mercy. If Sally Spectra has told her husband that she's pregnant? [Woman] Sally Spectra from the Bold and the Beautiful? Beautiful. [Woman] Yeah, she has. (speaking foreign language) [Richard] Gerardo's obsessional one-sidedness is, for Moretti, a counter-endorsement of the director's own intimate, confessional eclecticism. In the fifth section, Doctors, Moretti tells the story of his illness, the diary-like aspect of the film being reinforced by his filming in real life of his final chemotherapy session. The comedy of the section arises from the long path from his symptoms, nocturnal itching, to the diagnosis. Moretti collects his prescripts and keeps a record of his medical visits, and general practitioners, dermatologists, and specialists in traditional Chinese medicine offer ever-odder diagnoses and submit him to ever-more arduous treatments until he's diagnosed with a happily treatable form of cancer. But the near-death experience lends the glorious conclusion and retrospectively the entire film an air of exultation in the opportunities and peculiarities of daily life. It has the feel of a joyful recovery of life from the very clutches of oblivion. The first segment, in which Moretti drives around Rome and muses about his visions from the wheel of his Vespa is also the most cinema-centric of the three parts, as is appropriate, since the cinema is exactly what one would expect the great film maker to muse about. Moretti, who is in love with the face of Rome, fantasizes about a movie that would be nothing but houses and in the process, he makes it. He thinks about his pleasure in dancing, as sparked by a viewing of flash dance. And then meets, of all people, Jennifer Beals on the streets of Rome. Moretti drives out to the place where the director, Pier Paolo Pasolini was murdered in 1975. It's a remarkable, mournful sequence in which Moretti makes sure that the cinematogropher following him stays at a solemn, contemplative distance. But above all, this rest section contains what is, for me, the single greatest and most cautionary sequence about the practice of film criticism. Moretti takes the advice of a critic who has written enthusiastically about the film Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer. And here's the result. (speaking foreign language) \"The "}
