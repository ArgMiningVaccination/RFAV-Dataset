The study aims to describe the pathophysiology and discuss different therapeutic agents currently available for long COVID. Another objective is to assess comparative efficacy between different types of vaccines on symptoms of long COVID. A preliminary search was conducted using Ovid Medline, Embase, medRxiv, and NIH COVID-19 portfolios. A total of 16 studies were included in our review. Despite some of the data showing variable results, most of the vaccinated patients reported improvement in long COVID symptoms with no significant difference between various types of vaccines. Further trials are needed to better identify the comparative efficacy of vaccines for long COVID and ascertain other therapeutic modalities.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-07-16", "cleaned_text": "COVID-19 Vaccine and Long COVID: A Scoping Review [https://doi.org/10.3390/life12071066](https://doi.org/10.3390/life12071066) [COVID-19 [1](#B1-life-12-01066)]. Long COVID can impact any organ in the body and is characterized by a wide range of symptoms, profound fatigue being the most common one [ [2](#B2-life-12-01066)]. Uncertainties around the etiology and pathophysiology of long COVID have raised alarm in the general population and have led to vaccine hesitancy in the general population [ [3](#B3-life-12-01066)]. While vaccinations have significantly proven to be efficacious in decreasing the severity of symptoms and overall hospitalization rate, our understanding of their effect on long COVID remains limited [ [4](#B4-life-12-01066), [5](#B5-life-12-01066)]. - To describe the pathophysiology of long COVID along with the most common signs and symptoms. - To study the impact of vaccination on patients with preexisting signs and symptoms of long COVID. - To decipher the impact of vaccinations before developing COVID-19 infection. - To find any possible differences that may exist in the rates of developing long COVID when comparing vaccinated vs. unvaccinated people. - To distinguish any similarities or differences between the various types of vaccines and the risk of developing long COVID symptoms. - To report the management and therapeutic options available for long COVID. 2. Methods 3. Results A Total of 16 Studies Were Included in Our Review and Were Divided into Two Groups [Table 1](#life-12-01066-t001). A total of 35,527 participants were included, with 32,726 of those vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. A total of 8667 participants had preexisting signs and symptoms of long COVID. While there were limited data available about first and second doses, most of the participants reported improvement in symptoms after one dose, with few claiming no change, and a small cohort described worsening symptoms. [8](#B8-life-12-01066)] utilized a questionnaire regarding the patient experience of long COVID symptomatology and functional status. A total of 28,356 participants were included and followed for an 8-month period. The first and second vaccine dose were associated with an improvement of long COVID symptomatology as defined in the study (OR = 0.87) and (OR = 0.91), respectively. [11](#B11-life-12-01066)] recruited 1596 symptomatic patients who were followed by means of a survey for the development of six cardinal symptoms of long COVID as defined by the study. A total of 825 participants were unvaccinated, 424 were partially vaccinated, and 347 were fully vaccinated. Participants who were partially or fully vaccinated had a decreased prevalence of the six cardinal post-SARS-CoV-2 symptoms (adjusted OR = 0.72) as well as a decreased prevalence of any one symptom (adjusted OR = 0.60). [15](#B15-life-12-01066)] conducted an online survey where patients with long COVID were invited to complete a web-based questionnaire that included the range and severity of long COVID symptoms and which vaccine they had received. Out of the 812 participants included, 698 were partially vaccinated and 114 were fully vaccinated. Of the total participants, 57% reported an improvement in symptoms, 25% reported no change, while 19% of participants reported a worsening of symptoms. [16](#B16-life-12-01066)] recruited 910 participants who either had confirmed or highly suspected COVID-19 infection and were followed for 120 days. A total of 455 patients were vaccinated and were matched with 455 unvaccinated patients. The participant-reported data were then analyzed to form an arbitrarily assigned ST score from 0 to 53 reflecting the number and severity of symptoms. It was found that long COVID symptoms were less severe in vaccinated compared with unvaccinated participants (mean difference in COVID ST score = 1.8) and it was also found that vaccinated participants were more likely to experience remission of symptoms (HR = 1.97). [7](#B7-life-12-01066)] recruited 44 vaccinated and 22 unvaccinated patients who were exhibiting long COVID symptoms. Both sets of participants were then followed for a period of one month for persistent symptoms of long COVID-19. The study found that vaccinated patients were more likely to show symptomatic improvement (23.2% vs. 15.4%, p = 0.035). [17](#B17-life-12-01066)] recruited 453 participants with at least one long COVID symptom to complete a baseline interview regarding symptomatology, who were then followed for 6 months. Of those participants, 324 were vaccinated and 129 were unvaccinated. By the end of the 6-month period, the study showed no significant association between symptomatology as defined by the study and vaccination status (p > 0.05 for all comparisons). [13](#B13-life-12-01066)] evaluated 380 vaccinated patients exhibiting long COVID symptoms for at least 4 weeks. The study found that 47% of patients demonstrated no change in symptoms over the 4-week period, 31% of patients showed worsening symptoms, and lastly only 22% of patients felt an improvement in their symptoms, most commonly anosmia and brain fog. [9](#B9-life-12-01066)] evaluated 83 healthcare workers who were suffering from long COVID syndrome. The study utilized a questionnaire that evaluated any changes in long COVID symptomatology over the course of several weeks. It was found that 14 (21%) participants reported symptomatic improvement, 8 (12%) participants reported a worsening in symptoms, and 45 (67%) participants reported no change in their symptoms. [12](#B12-life-12-01066)] investigated the impact of vaccination on the development of long COVID symptoms. Participants were to be evaluated at baseline and then telephone-interviewed by the same trained nurses at 6 and 12 months using a standardized questionnaire. Out of the 479 participants recruited, 132 patients were fully vaccinated, while 347 patients were unvaccinated. After analysis, the study found that there was no statistically significant difference between the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups regarding any of the post-COVID syndrome symptoms as defined in the study (p > 0.05). [14](#B14-life-12-01066)] conducted a cross-sectional study aimed to examine a total of 773 participants with confirmed COVID-19 infection by asking them to complete a survey over a 6-week period. Of those participants, 407 were unvaccinated, 173 were partially vaccinated, and 193 were fully vaccinated. The study found that fully vaccinated individuals were less likely to have long COVID symptoms (OR = 0.55). [10](#B10-life-12-01066)] recruited 951 participants with confirmed COVID-19 infection (RT-PCR) over 1 year. Participants were then followed up between 16 July and 18 November 2021 by means of an online survey. Upon analysis, the study found that the fully vaccinated were 36-73% less likely to report 7 of the 10 most commonly reported long COVID symptoms (p < 0.04). [6](#B6-life-12-01066)] recruited 487 participants who tested positive for COVID-19. Participants were surveyed regarding vaccination status and long COVID symptomatology. A total of 287 participants were fully vaccinated with COVAXIN, 81 participants were partially vaccinated, and 119 participants were unvaccinated. The study found a positive correlation between vaccination status and the development of long COVID symptoms (adjusted OR = 2.32). [Table 2](#life-12-01066-t002). A total of 264,389 participants were studied, with 32,052 vaccinated participants. [20](#B20-life-12-01066)] in 2021 aimed at studying the relationship between vaccination status before or after confirmed COVID-19 infection and the development of long COVID symptoms. A total of 240,648 cases were eventually recruited. Of these, 220,460 cases were unvaccinated by 12 weeks after their COVID-19 diagnosis, 17,796 cases received 1 dose of vaccine within 12 weeks of their diagnosis, and only 2392 cases received 1 dose of vaccine before their diagnosis. Participants were followed and surveyed at 12 and 20-week periods after diagnosis for the persistence of long COVID symptoms. Participants who were vaccinated before diagnosis, 4 to 8 weeks after diagnosis, and 8 to 12 weeks after diagnosis were less likely to have any symptoms of long COVID after the follow-up period (OR = 0.220) (OR = 0.535) (OR = 0.747) respectively. [18](#B18-life-12-01066)] recruited 4,740 participants and followed them for one month for the persistence of long COVID symptoms. A total of 2370 unvaccinated patients were matched with the same number of participants who were fully vaccinated. It was found that participants of all age groups who were partially or fully vaccinated were less likely to be hospitalized (OR = 0.31). The study also found that fully vaccinated participants of all groups were about half as likely to have symptoms lasting 28 days than unvaccinated participants (OR = 0.51). [19](#B19-life-12-01066)] recruited 9479 vaccinated individuals who were matched with the same number of unvaccinated individuals with confirmed COVID-19 infection. The participants were followed and surveyed after a 6-month period. The study found that there was no association between vaccination and the composite long COVID-19 outcome (HR = 1). [21](#B21-life-12-01066)], 28 unvaccinated and 15 vaccinated participants were recruited. All the individuals underwent a symptom limited cardio-pulmonary exercise test (CPET) after acute COVID-19 infection to compare aerobic capacity and exercise performance. A significant difference between the vaccinated and unvaccinated group was identified with a lower peak oxygen-consumption percentage, reduction in the peak-exercise heart rate, and lower ventilation values noted in the vaccinated group. 4. Discussion [22](#B22-life-12-01066), [23](#B23-life-12-01066)]. Persistent viremia, viral shedding, variable organ injury, and healing time are the few most common hypotheses. While the pathophysiology remains uncertain, there are also no definite diagnostic criteria for long COVID. Involvement of all organ systems has been reported and long COVID is characterized by a wide range of symptoms ranging from fatigue to cognitive dysfunctions. If anything, it highlights the heterogeneity of symptoms, and the significant functional impact of prolonged illness on somatic, cognitive, and psychological health. [24](#B24-life-12-01066)]. [25](#B25-life-12-01066)]. In literature, the severity of disease at onset, hospital admission, obesity, pre-existing comorbidities (particularly asthma), and the need for oxygen therapy are highlighted as the main determinants of long-term symptoms [ [26](#B26-life-12-01066), [27](#B27-life-12-01066)]. [28](#B28-life-12-01066)]. At the population level, it is critical to quantify the burden of long COVID to assess its impact on the healthcare system and identify age, gender, and the demographic group as probable risk factors to ensure inclusive, equitable, and effective healthcare for everyone despite the growing healthcare disparities. [29](#B29-life-12-01066)]. Vaccination can help reset the immune and inflammatory response and can also help eradicate the persistent viral particles. More studies are needed to identify the triggers and if consistent can help develop the potential therapeutic targets. 4.1. COVID-19 Vaccination after Developing COVID-19 Infection [7](#B7-life-12-01066)]. He reported a decrease in symptom burden in those patients who were vaccinated with no worsening of symptoms or quality of life. His findings were consistent with Ayoub, who observed that the first dose of vaccine was significantly associated with a 13% decrease in the development of long COVID symptoms with sustained improvement after the second dose over the median follow-up for 67 days [ [8](#B8-life-12-01066)]. These findings were consistent with other studies by Strain and Tran [ [15](#B15-life-12-01066), [16](#B16-life-12-01066)]. [11](#B11-life-12-01066)]. These symptoms were fatigue, difficulty concentrating or memory loss, loss of or change in smell and taste, shortness of breath, and headache. [9](#B9-life-12-01066)]. 4.2. COVID-19 Vaccination before Developing COVID-19 Infection [20](#B20-life-12-01066)]. Al-Aly et al. also identified a similar finding in the population who received both doses and had no history of prior infection [ [30](#B30-life-12-01066)]. On the contrary, Taquet et al. did not find any difference between vaccinated and unvaccinated populations [ [19](#B19-life-12-01066)]. Paradoxically, Arjun et al. reported worsening symptoms in participants who were completely vaccinated before contracting the coronavirus disease [ [6](#B6-life-12-01066)]. 4.3. Difference between Vaccines? [15](#B15-life-12-01066)]. None of the other literature we studied identified any such difference and reported no association between efficacy and type of vaccines. The observational nature of these findings calls for multiple randomized controlled trials to better identify a difference. [31](#B31-life-12-01066)]. Furthermore, this may encourage international initiatives such as COVAX spearheaded by Gavi, WHO, and UNICEF [ [32](#B32-life-12-01066)]. The COVAX initiative has not only administered over 1 billion vaccines (mostly AstraZeneca) but has also helped develop the logistical capabilities of countries and their procurement of vaccines. In middle- and low-income countries, vaccination may act as an additional layer of protection along with the proven methods of social distancing and self-isolation in curtailing COVID and the development of long COVID. 4.4. Approach to Patients with Long COVID [33](#B33-life-12-01066)]. Another study reported 19.1% of patients being unable to work, (mostly due to a COVID-related illness.) with 12% of patients hospitalized 2 weeks after the onset of illness [ [28](#B28-life-12-01066)]. This highlights the urgent need for proper guidelines to identify, support and manage the symptoms of long COVID. 4.5. Are Antivirals an Answer? [34](#B34-life-12-01066)]. Bigel et al. in a double-blind randomized controlled trial first reported the efficacy of remdesivir. They found that the remdesivir group had a faster recovery time as compared to the placebo. This was consistent with the findings of another trial that assessed nonhospitalized participants with a high risk of COVID-19 progression. Gottlieb et al. in this study found that a 3-day course of remdesivir had an 87% lower risk of hospitalization or death than a placebo, as well as an acceptable safety profile [ [35](#B35-life-12-01066)]. While the preliminary data against acute infections are promising, not much has been studied about its efficacy against long-term complications of COVID-19. The accessibility and dosing of Remdesivir also make it a difficult drug of choice to combat COVID-19. [36](#B36-life-12-01066)]. It has two components, Nirmatrelvir (Protease needed for the replication of coronavirus. Coadministration with a low dose of ritonavir helps slow the metabolism of Nirmatrelvir and increases its levels in the body. Hammond et al. in a phase 2/3 double-blind clinical trial reported an 89% lower risk of progression to severe COVID infection after treatment with PAXLOVID as compared to placebo [ [37](#B37-life-12-01066)]. They also reported no serious adverse effects, leading to its approval from the FDA in December 2021. Recently Najjar-Debbiny conducted a wide-scale retrospective analysis in Israel to assess its efficacy in a non-controlled setting and reported similar findings [ [38](#B38-life-12-01066)]. Interestingly, the study also found that PAXLOVID is more effective in high-risk patients; older, immunosuppressed, and patients with underlying neurological or cardiovascular disease. While PAXLOVID was associated with positive outcomes, its ritonavir component makes it a difficult drug to prescribe due to many complex drug-drug interactions. They concluded that while PAXLOVID shows great promise, the COVID-19 vaccine remains the most effective way to prevent disease progression and death among COVID-19 patients. Gupta et al. in a recent preprint reported a relapse of symptoms in a 71-year-old vaccinated and boosted male whose symptoms responded to PAXLOVID [ [39](#B39-life-12-01066)]. The viral load fluctuated with symptoms with two distinctive peaks on days 1 and 9. This poses the question if PAXLOVID should be used as a bridge to transiently suppress viral replication till natural immunity takes over. Further randomized controlled trials are warranted to better understand the dosing and efficacy of PAXLOVID. [40](#B40-life-12-01066)]. Li et al. studied Molnupiravir in addition to PAXLOVID and their efficacy against the Omicron virus. Their study has demonstrated that molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir potently inhibited the infection of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant [ [41](#B41-life-12-01066)]. The combination of molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir also exerted synergistic antiviral activity, indicating their efficacy against different variants. 5.
