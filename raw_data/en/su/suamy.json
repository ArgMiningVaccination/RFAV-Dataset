This initiative began in November 2011, when a wide range of stakeholders gathered to address the growing chronic disease burden in New Jersey. Bringing in expertise and experience from organizations and initiatives all over the state, they created workgroups that shared the common goal of creating a framework that would allow us all to initiate an evidence-based strategy to promote disease prevention and wellness programs for a healthier New Jersey. Chronic disease puts a tremendous burden on individuals, families, and communities. It is a major cause of disability and death and a major contributor to escalating healthcare costs in the United States. Seven of the leading causes of death in NJ are chronic diseases. Heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes caused 59% of deaths in New Jersey last year. Chronic disease has been characterized as the public health challenge of the 21st century. Partnering for a Healthy New Jersey documents the activities and recommendations of these workgroups and provides the framework for a statewide approach to implement evidence-based prevention programs and environmental strategies to promote prevention and wellness programs, and to support healthy lifestyles for a growing population over the next five years. We are grateful to the scores of individuals representing nonprofit organizations, advocacy organizations, academic institutions, and businesses, who participated in these meetings and workgroup activities. It is our hope that this plan and the work that follows will move us towards achieving sustainable reductions of the chronic disease burden in New Jersey. Sincerely, Mary E. O'Dowd, M.P.H.

Introduction | The Planning Context in New Jersey 4 Partnering for a Healthy New Jersey : Chronic Disease & Health Promotion Plan 2013 - 2018 INTRODUCTION The Planning Context in New Jersey According to The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP), chronic diseases - such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, and arthritis - are among the most common, costly, and preventable of all health problems in the United States. The NCCDPHP has called upon all states and territories to strengthen and better coordinate activities within health departments and in the community aimed at preventing chronic diseases and promoting health. This CDC initiative aims to improve health and the quality of life by promoting environmental and policy changes related to nutrition, physical activity, and clinical preventive services, and by promoting education and management skills for people diagnosed with or at high risk for chronic diseases. A major portion of this CDC initiative is the joint development of this State Plan for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion in New Jersey. This plan represents the work of a wide variety of New Jersey stakeholders including various parts of state government, the healthcare sector, private business, local government, and community service providers. An integrated approach to reducing the individual and community burden of chronic disease will require this joint effort. New Jersey is well on its way towards improving health and wellness. New Jersey made the largest improvement by any state for overall state health between 2011 and 2012. According to the 2012 America's Health Rankings , compiled by the United Health Foundation, New Jersey ranked 8th overall, up from 17th in 2011. New Jersey was also in the top ten of all states in a number of healthcare core measures. Besides having one of the lowest smoking rates and one of the highest income per capita rates in the nation, New Jersey excelled in several specific core measures:1 Introduction | The Planning Context in New Jersey 5 Partnering for a Healthy New Jersey : Chronic Disease & Health Promotion Plan 2013 - 2018 Table 1 | Non-Social Determinants of Health and Actual Health Outcomes Core Measures1 National Ranking Over-18 smoking rates 3rd out of 50 states Adult obesity rates 4th out of 50 states Teen birth rate 5th out of 50 states Infectious disease rate 6th out of 50 states Premature death rates; Percentage of adult population who have been told by a healthcare professional that they have had a stroke 7th out of 50 states Infant mortality rate 9th out of 50 states The fourth smallest state in land mass, New Jersey has a very strong \"home rule\" ethos with 21 counties, 565 local municipalities, 95 local health departments, and 690 public school districts. It is also the most densely populated state and one of the most diverse, with close to 30% of the population speaking a language other than English at home. Such diversity and local control mean that one size never fits all, and local policy decisions carry at least as much weight as state level policy. Thus, such rankings are possible because of the efforts not just of state-level organizations, but local policy makers. In fact, the CEO of UnitedHealth attributed New Jersey's commendable rankings to the wellness programs instituted by employers in many local municipalities,2 brought about by state and federal healthcare reform efforts.3 New Jersey is bordered by the first and fourth largest media markets in the country. The absence of print and broadcast media dedicated to New Jersey limits the state's direct messaging to residents, and health promotion messaging to residents must compete with messaging from New York and Pennsylvania. This is a challenge that New Jersey news organizations describe not as a hindrance, but as \"a rare opportunity to...share resources, and reach broader audiences throughout the state...encouraging the public to participate more actively in their communities.\"4 Although some of the above factors present challenges, they also present opportunities. Activities at the \"ground level\" can more effectively address the specific needs of target populations in that community. Over 390 local communities have registered and established local Green Teams under the Sustainable Jersey certification program. These communities are Introduction | The Planning Context in New Jersey 6 Partnering for a Healthy New Jersey : Chronic Disease & Health Promotion Plan 2013 - 2018 customizing evidence-based toolkits to build local sustainability and improve community health. At the same time, the current economic climate in a state with very high property taxes has forced communities to seriously consider economy of scale and regionalization. There are new and exciting examples of shared services across municipalities - a trend that was unthinkable just a few years ago. These new shared services include mergers of local health departments, combined county-wide transportation services for the disabled and elderly, and shared public health nurses across municipalities. Similar challenges and opportunities exist within state agencies. There are currently 5,200 fewer state government employees than in 2011, with most of the reductions coming from unfilled positions and retirements. A prolonged hiring freeze and budget reductions have impacted every state department and have affected state department infrastructure capabilities, particularly in technology. The goal for leaner, more efficient government is changing the role of every part of state government and the relationships between departments. The New Jersey Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Plan is directly connected to the NJDOH Strategic Plan (see page 14), which means that the New Jersey Chronic Disease Prevention and Control Unit (NJCDPC) can better leverage its efforts within the NJDOH as a whole and across a number of state departments. Of course, successful messaging is only part of the solution; messaging has no influence on social determinants like personal income. Thus, while Table 2 shows that the personal income rates in New Jersey are higher than average, these rates vary drastically by county; poverty levels range from 3.6% in Hunterdon County to 15.7% in Cumberland County. More than half of the counties in the state have poverty levels above the national average, but this is offset by counties whose poverty levels are far, far lower than the rest of the country. This is true of most social determinants (e.g. in 2011, Cumberland County's Memorial High School had a graduation rate of 14%; Hunterdon County's South Hunterdon Regional High had a graduation rate of 100%5, but New Jersey ranks 6th in the nation for high school graduation rates), so a commendable national ranking like those in Table 2 should not be taken to mean that there is not a significant proportion of the state population in need of customized healthcare initiatives and community supports. Introduction | The Planning Context in New Jersey 7 Partnering for a Healthy New Jersey : Chronic Disease & Health Promotion Plan 2013 - 2018 Table 2 | Social Determinants of Health and Actual Health Outcomes Core Measures 1 National Ranking Personal income per capita 3rd out of 50 states Percent of incoming 9th graders who graduate in four years 6th out of 50 states Number of primary care physiciansi 9th out of 50 states Reducing the burden and impact of chronic disease and building healthy communities will require the coordination of efforts of many state departments, most notably departments dealing with human services, insurance, transportation, municipal land use, education, agriculture, and environmental protection. It will also require the full engagement of outside partners in healthcare, local government, and community-based services. While state government has an important and unique role to play, it is clear that nurturing and supporting strong public-private partnerships is becoming a key role of state government. Changes at the federal level in healthcare delivery are creating powerful forces that currently are and will continue to significantly redefine health systems in New Jersey. The planning process made evident that New Jersey has significant public and private health resources available but has lagged in cross-system collaboration and communication. Our \"home rule\" ethos can create unique obstacles to collaboration. Some indicators that NJ is lagging in key areas include: 71.8% of office-based physicians are using an electr onic health records (EHRs) system in the United States while only 53.8% of New Jersey's office-based physicians are using an EHR system.6 Medicare hospital readmission rates in New Jersey fa r exceed the national average. Care transitions are generally problematic and insufficient for community-based care and support, but especially among high risk populations.7 Reducing hospital readmissions will require that New Jersey follow the comprehensive approach to wellness described by the National Prevention and Health Promotion Strategy. We will join with other private partners in shifting the focus from illness to wellness. We will expand our focus from living well with chronic disease to also include primary prevention through making the healthy choice the easy choice in local communities. We are joining with our partners i Based on the number of primary care physicians per 100,000 residents. Introduction | The Planning Context in New Jersey 8 Partnering for a Healthy New Jersey : Chronic Disease & Health Promotion Plan 2013 - 2018 in the private sector in making the shift to evidence-based practice and data-informed decision- making to reduce costs and improve quality care. Figure 1 | National vs. New Jersey Readmission Rates Such system changes offer opportunities for restructuring and new role definition for all government, clinical and community partners. New Jersey already has a number of existing state, regional, and local collaborations focused on chronic disease prevention and healthcare reform, presenting both an opportunity and a challenge. Using the principles of community engagement, we must all work to: Share a common agenda; Respect the unique culture, social n etworks, norms and values of various communities; Build trust across all sectors; Accept the right and responsibility for c ommunity based self determination; Share power at all levels and across all s ectors; Engage in continuous communications a nd capacity building; and Ensure a strong infrastructure to s upport sustainable long term collaboration. \" John Kania and Mark Kramer in \"Collective Impact,\" Stanford Social Innovation Review, Winter 2011, speak about the need for coordinated efforts across sectors to address social issues. They also speak to the time and effort that must be expended to build the communication and structure for collaboration.8 \" Introduction | The Planning Context in New Jersey 9 Partnering for a Healthy New Jersey : Chronic Disease & Health Promotion Plan 2013 - 2018 In summary, any New Jersey-specific chronic disease prevention and health promotion efforts should: Always be adapted for a wide variety of diverse audi ences; Include both community-based and regional health & w ellness models; Include communication strategies that can break thro ugh the noise of other media markets; Have strong and broad public and private co-ownershi p and engagement in implementation; and Build adequate state government infrastructure for c ontributing to the process of community engagement. Partnering for a Healthy New Jersey : Chronic Disease & Health Promotion Plan 2013 - 2018 Part One | Stakeholder Engagement in Planning 10 PART ONE Stakeholder Engagement in Planning FIRST PHASE The New Jersey Chronic Disease Prevention and Control Services Unit (NJCDPC), housed under the Family Health Services (FHS) Division, Public Health Services Branch, within the New Jersey Department of Health, kicked off the planning process by convening an internal Chronic Disease Planning Team (the Planning Team) in November 2011. The Chronic Disease Planning Team met regularly through 2012 to discuss internal opportunities for integration and to initiate planning efforts. The Chronic Disease Planning Team identified a preliminary list of key external stakeholders with expertise in each of the categorical areas of interest: heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, arthritis, poor nutrition, lack of physical activity, and tobacco use. Many of these individual stakeholders were already actively involved in at least one of the existing chronic disease-related partnership groups but to date had not formally worked together across disciplines on the issue of integration of efforts. Representatives of the NJCDPC Planning Team visited and/or conducted phone interviews with representatives of the partnership groups in June 2012 to begin discussions about future integration efforts and to identify key representatives that would participate in the external planning process. Overall, stakeholders were very interested and anxious for details about the New Jersey State Plan initiative and participating in the planning process. However, as the principles inherent in an integrated New Jersey State Plan would require changes to existing approaches stakeholders also expressed discomfort and concern in a number of areas: How will the new coordinated planning approach affec t existing initiatives? How will funds be allocated under the new coordinate d plan? How will the Workgroup meetings be scheduled so as n ot to interfere with collaborations already underway? How will the activities be coordinated and informati on shared? Partnering for a Healthy New Jersey : Chronic Disease & Health Promotion Plan 2013 - 2018 Part One | Stakeholder Engagement in Planning 11 How can the planning process ensure that evidence-ba sed programs currently underway will be incorporated? Will there be support for the New Jersey State Plan at top levels within the State, particularly in the Executive and Legislative branches? Will there be sufficient resources, particularly sta ff, at the Department of Health to support the planning process and implementation of the plan itself? How will we ensure that initiatives for important po pulation groups are properly addressed (e.g. children, the mentally ill, and other disparate populations)? SECOND PHASE A new Director of the NJCDPC Unit was appointed and began work in September 2012. The transition to new leadership created a slight delay in the planning process to ensure that the new leadership had time to get oriented and assess the internal needs of the unit. The New Jersey Chronic Disease Advisory Council (NJCDAC) acted as the external advisors to NJCDPC on the plan process and content. During the process they requested more information about the emerging paradigm shift from a chronic illness model to a wellness model. The Governor's Task Force on Cancer Prevention, Early Detection and Screening was also preparing to update their plan and was eager to coordinate efforts with an eye toward greater integration of strategies in the future. The two groups met together in January 2013 and heard presentations about New Jersey Community Transformation grant activities, the ShapingNJ Obesity Prevention Plan implementation efforts, and the National Prevention Strategy. In late January 2013, a full stakeholder meeting was held to kick off the external planning process and respond to some of the concerns expressed in the initial planning phase. Invitees included representatives from the existing and independently operating chronic disease partnership entities including the Pediatric Adult Asthma Coalition, NJ Breathes, Governor's Task Force on Cancer Prevention, ShapingNJ, and the NJCDAC. Key additional representatives from private businesses, health \" The New Jersey Chronic Disease Advisory Council (NJCDAC) includes NJDOH Commissioner- appointed members representing a wide range of constituents including healthcare providers, government agencies, professional organizations, healthcare organizations, and minority health groups. The purpose of CDAC is to act in an advisory capacity in the areas of chronic disease prevention, detection, and treatment. \" Partnering for a Healthy New Jersey : Chronic Disease & Health Promotion Plan 2013 - 2018 Part One | Stakeholder Engagement in Planning 12 insurance companies and others who will play a critical part in healthcare reform were invited to this meeting. The group received training in the core concepts of chronic disease prevention and health promotion. They then broke into domain workgroups to begin discussing available data about the chronic disease burden and related risk factors in New Jersey. The four domains outlined by the CDC provided the workgroup framework for the planning process: Domain One: Epidemiology, Surveillance and Evaluatio n, in which we gather, analyze and disseminate data and information and conduct evaluation to inform, prioritize, deliver, and monitor programs and population health. Domain Two: Environmental Strategies , in which we promote health and support and reinforce healthful behaviors statewide in schools, worksites, and communities. Domain Three: Health System Interventions , in which we improve the effective delivery and use of clinical and other preventive services to prevent disease, detect disease early, reduce or eliminate risk factors, and mitigate or manage complications. Domain Four: Community-Clinical Linkages , in which we ensure that communities support and clinics refer patients to programs that improve management of chronic conditions. The external planning process was created to cover t he following topics in each of four domains: Prioritization of key disparate populations across r isk factors and disease areas, including identification of the barriers faced by these populations; Assessment of current evidence-based strategies for each domain that should be integrated and brought to scale in the future, and opportunities for pilot testing new strategies that will be needed to address the needs of the identified disparate populations; Assessment of existing policy that supports wellness in NJ and future policy needs to support new community and population norms about wellness; and Identification of key messaging that will support th is integrated shift to wellness. During the spring of 2013, twenty-two stakeholder me etings were held. Bracketed by two statewide meetings, workgroups designated by domain met five times each. A list of the various people and the organizations represented is in Appendix I: Planning Stakeholders. Each workgroup was facilitated by NJCDPC staff representatives. The stakeholder priorities from the workgroups were summarized and shared in July 2013 with the New Jersey Chronic Disease Advisory Council, NJDOH leadership, and at a follow-up Partnering for a Healthy New Jersey : Chronic Disease & Health Promotion Plan 2013 - 2018 Part One | Stakeholder Engagement in Planning 13 meeting of stakeholders. This New Jersey Chronic Disease Prevention & Health Promotion Plan (the Plan) represents the final consensus of priorities that will guide all activities aimed at reducing the burden of chronic disease in New Jersey for the next five years. The final stakeholder planning meeting was held July 11, 2013, and stakeholder representatives presented the findings from each domain workgroup. Participants also shared the lessons learned from the planning process including: There is much happening in New Jersey to help our re sidents get healthy. Working together leads to better coordination and use of resources for building networks and breaking out of silos. Workgroup members found that the greatest risk facto rs for chronic disease are often the same across diseases, and there are opportunities to work together toward the common goal of decreasing chronic disease. Workgroup members were highly engaged in the process and are committed to staying engaged through implementation. This process differed from other past processes in t hat stakeholders were treated as equal partners in the development of final plan recommendations. Part Two | State Plan Integration 14 Partnering for a Healthy New Jersey : Chronic Disease & Health Promotion Plan 2013 - 2018 PART TWO State Plan Integration The work of this five-year plan is directly correlated with the NJDOH Strategic Plan: 2012- 2015: Lead Proactive Efforts to Drive Measurable Improveme nts in the Health of the People of New Jersey. Both have a common goal of leading proactive effor ts to drive measurable improvements in the health of the people of New Jersey: Table 3 | Common Goals of the NJDOH Strategic Plan and NJCDPHP Plan NJ Department of Health Strategic Plan, 2012-2015 Partnering for a Healthy New Jersey: New Jersey Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Plan, 2013-2018 Strengthen the demonstrated impact of public health programs. Improve access, application, communication and collaboration around data collection, analysis, and distribution to ensure population management and data-based decision making at all levels. Communicate the value & contributions to public health. Establish advanced and culturally appropriate communication channels to stakeholders and the public at large, with special attention paid to ensuring that people can easily act on information so they can live healthier lives. Foster accountable, accessible health & prevention services. Prioritize evidence-based strategies for: Achieving policy and environmental changes to make t he healthy choice the easy choice for everyone in NJ; Achieving important improvements so that state healt hcare systems detect, manage, and control chronic disease, conditions and risk factors through better use of chronic disease early detection and clinical preventive services; and Enhancing clinical-community linkages so that people at high risk can better take charge of their health through self- management and other community supports. Optimize the acquisition & utilization of resources. Leverage both public and private resources to implement plan strategies and build sustainable infrastructure for collaboration. Strengthen organizational effectiveness & adaptability. Develop and implement a NJCDPC staffing structure that ensures high quality strategy integration, external collaboration, and evaluation. Expand & strengthen key partnerships. Using the principles of \"community engagement,\" build strong public-private partnerships that make the best use of each other's skills, time and available resources. Part Three | Disease Burd en 15 Partnering for a Healthy New Jersey : Chronic Disease & Health Promotion Plan 2013 - 2018 PART THREE Disease Burden Chronic Disease is a major cause of disability and death in New Jersey and the United States. In New Jersey in 2009, heart disease, cancer, stroke and diabetes caused 59% of deaths.9 Reducing this burden with an emphasis on wellness across the diseases would have a major impact on the residents of the State, both personally and collectively. For example, in 2009, according to America's Health Rankings, New Jersey spent an estimated $2.2 billion in obesity- attributable healthcare. Figure 2 | Distribution of New Jersey Deaths by Underlying Cause, 20099 Chronic disease puts a tremendous burden on families and communities. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), chronic diseases are responsible for about 70% of all deaths nationally and lead to disabilities for nearly 10% of Americans.10 Experts estimate that about 83% of health care spending in the U.S. is accounted for by people with chronic conditions.11 It is not surprising that chronic disease has been characterized as the public health challenge of the 21st century.12 Part Three | Disease Burd en 16 Partnering for a Healthy New Jersey : Chronic Disease & Health Promotion Plan 2013 - 2018 Figure 3 | Chronic Disease Prevalence by Activity Limitation, New Jersey Adults, 2009-201013 Arthritis is known nationally as the leading cause of disability. Among New Jersey adults with activity limitations, about 53% have arthritis. Figure 4 | Leading Causes of Death, New Jersey and the United States, 20099 Seven of the ten leading causes of death in New Jersey are chronic diseases. Despite a dvances in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, stroke for example, remains a leading cause of death in New Jersey.14 Just last year, there were more than 20,000 hospitalizations attributable to stroke and more than 1,000 of those patients died while in the hospital. Part Three | Disease Burd en 17 Partnering for a Healthy New Jersey : Chronic Disease & Health Promotion Plan 2013 - 2018 According to the CDC, New Jersey women younger than 65 years of age had a higher incidence rate of breast cancer (129.7) compared to the national rate (121.2). New Jersey ranking by cancer incidence nationally includes: breast (10th), cervical (16th), colorectal (17th), and, prostate (6th). In NJ, the age-adjusted cancer incidence rate for both males and females is significantly higher than the national average. Primary cancers with the ten highest age- adjusted incidence rates from 2006 to 2010 in New Jersey were prostate, lung, colon and rectum, urinary bladder, melanoma of the skin, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, kidney and renal pelvis, leukemia, pancreas and oral cavity and pharynx for men; and breast, lung, colon and rectum, endometrial (corpus and uterus, NOS), thyroid, melanoma of the skin, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, ovary, urinary bladder, and pancreas for women. These cancer cases accounted for 79 percent of the total cancers.15 In New Jersey, diabetes was the sixth-leading cause of death in 2009. Adult diabetes is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke. What is important about this is that diabetes has become a Top 10 Leading Cause of Death in New Jersey and the U.S. over the last decade. The most recent asthma surveillance data for New Jersey shows that approximately 14.2% of the State's children have a history of asthma and approximately 9% of the children have current asthma.17 Asthma was the leading cause of hospitalization for New Jersey children aged one through seventeen years.18 About 44% of New Jersey children aged birth through four years with a diagnosis of asthma experience activity limitation due to their asthma symptoms. Residents had nearly 52,000 emergency department visits and 15,000 hospitalizations for asthma in 2011.19 In New Jersey, 24% of adults and 11% of high school students are obese.10 Over the past ten years, rates of adult obesity increased 40%. If obesity rates continue to increase at the current pace, nearly half of NJ adults will be obese in 2030. Tobacco use is the single most preventable cause of death and disease in the United States. Tobacco use increases the risk for lung cancer and cardiovascular disease. Between 2000 and 2010, the smoking prevalence for New Jersey was less than the national average, but there is \" Tobacco use, followed by poor diet and physical inactivity, is the leading modifiable risk factors associated with death.16 \" Part Three | Disease Burd en 18 Partnering for a Healthy New Jersey : Chronic Disease & Health Promotion Plan 2013 - 2018 still room for improvement. About 17 percent of adults and 14 percent of high school students are current smokers.13,20 The burden of these conditions is not uniformly distributed amongst the residents of New Jersey. POVERTY AFFECTS CHRONIC DISEASE BURDEN According to the 2012 U.S. Census, approximately 9.4% of New Jersey's population lives below the poverty level compared to 14.3% nationally. New Jersey has a higher mean family income ($111,800) compared to the U.S. as a whole ($84,422). These statistics are somewhat misleading. While New Jersey as a whole fares better than the national average, there are still areas of the State impacted by higher rates of poverty than others, with some \"hot spots\" as high as 15.7% of the population below poverty level (Cumberland County). Table 4 and Figure 5, with data provided by the U.S. Census Bureau, 2012, illustrate the variation in poverty level by county. Figure 5 | Percent of Residents below Poverty Level in New Jersey, By County Part Three | Disease Burd en 19 Partnering for a Healthy New Jersey : Chronic Disease & Health Promotion Plan 2013 - 2018 Table 4 | Poverty in New Jersey by County County Below Poverty Line Atlantic 12.5% Bergen 6.1% Burlington 5.3% Camden Union 9.8% Warren 7.6% New Jersey residents living below the poverty level experience a higher chronic disease burden. Obesity prevalence among low-income children ages two to less than five years is one of the highest in the nation.13 Part Three | Disease Burd en 20 Partnering for a Healthy New Jersey : Chronic Disease & Health Promotion Plan 2013 - 2018 Among residents living in households where total income is less than $15,000 per year: Adult and childhood asthma prevalence is highest (14 .5% and 14.4%, respectively);20 Adult arthritis prevalence is highest (33.8%);12 Adult diabetes prevalence is highest (15.1%);12 and Adults smoking prevalence is highest (27.2%)12 RACE AND ETHNICITY AFFECT CHRONIC DISEASE BURDEN Black residents have the: Highest asthma prevalence, hospitalization and ED vi sit rates across all ages;21 Highest diabetes prevalence among adults;12 Highest age-adjusted diabetes, heart disease, and st roke mortality; 12 Highest smoking and obesity prevalence among adults; 12 Highest age-adjusted cancer mortality rate; 12 and Highest percent with late-stage breast cancer diagno sis across all ages among women with breast cancer.22 Hispanic residents have the: Highest percent of adults with arthritis who report fair or poor health status (47%);23 Second-highest diabetes prevalence (9.5%);12 and Second-highest age-adjusted mortality rate for diabe tes. 12 GEOGRAPHY AFFECTS CHRONIC DISEASE BURDEN Asthma Emergency Department visits vary widely by county with age-adjusted rates ranging from 232 per 100,000 among residents of Hunterdon County to 1,254 per 100,000 among residents of Essex County.16 HOT SPOTS AND READMISSION RATES New Jersey has clear \"hot spots\" for the chronic disease burden. Significant future healthcare cost savings will require specific, targeted shorter-term investments, especially in high-risk communities. For example, a recent study from the Rutgers University Center for State Health Policy describes the differences in hospital readmissions by income.24 While the State ranks high in income level, the unfortunate reality is that there are many counties in which the poverty level is significantly higher than average (See Table 4, Page 19). Table 5 Part Three | Disease Burd en 21 Partnering for a Healthy New Jersey : Chronic Disease & Health Promotion Plan 2013 - 2018 shows how New Jersey readmission rates across the board are some of the highest in the nation, ranking very last out of 50 states and three U.S. territories for readmissions of patients discharged to skilled nursing facilities (SNF).25 Table 5 | Readmission Rankings 30-Day Readmission NJ 2011 Rank (out of 53) NJ 2011 Rate National Rate26 All Readmissions 50 21.2% 17.6% Readmissions of Patients Discharged to Home without Home Healthcare 49 18.1% 17.1% Readmissions of Patients Discharged to SNFs 52 26.1% 22.2% Readmissions of Patients Discharged with Home 22.3% Readmissions of Hospice Patients 24 2.8% 2.6% In the past, hospitals had no financial incentives to reduce readmission rates and even benefited from higher readmission rates due to the cost of repeated treatments. Since 2010, however, hospitals have been penalized for high readmission rates and pushed to increase the quality of post-discharge care. The national average for readmissions has been about 19 percent for several years, but New Jersey readmission rates have seen no significant reduction in that time period.27 It is important to note that although a readmission rate on the surface does not appear to be significantly above the national average, the ranking reflects the reality: New Jersey readmission rates are very nearly the highest in the nation. Much of this is because of the disproportionately high poverty rates in over half the counties in the State. Overall, New Jersey poverty rates are ranked among the lowest in the nation, but this is because of extremely low rates in Hunterdon, Sussex, and Warren counties, among others (see Table 4, page 19). Not surprisingly, readmission rates in Hunterdon, Sussex, and Warren counties are the lowest in the State and well below the national average, while readmission rates from the poorest counties (e.g. Hudson, Essex, and Salem) are well above average.28 Part Three | Disease Burd en 22 Partnering for a Healthy New Jersey : Chronic Disease & Health Promotion Plan 2013 - 2018 Table 6 demonstrates the association of poverty levels and readmission rates in several NJ counties. Table 6 | Positive Correlation Between Poverty and Readmission Rate County Below Poverty Line Readmission Part Four | Winnable Battles 23 Partnering for a Healthy New Jersey : Chronic Disease & Health Promotion Plan 2013 - 2018 PART FOUR Winnable Battles Chronic disease and the related modifiable risk factors such as physical inactivity, poor diet, tobacco use, and obesity are clearly contributing causes of death and disability in New Jersey. Winnable Battles are public health priorities with large-scale impact on health and with known, effective strategies to address them. Winning these battles through use of evidence-based strategies and a focus on \"health in all policies\" is at the core of the Plan priorities. New Jersey has identified the following priorities of winnable battles for chronic disease prevention and health promotion: Increase physical activity; Improve nutrition; Eliminate tobacco use; Improve environmental health; Enable self management; Increase early detection; and Improve access to quality health care. The planning process kept these modifiable risk fact ors front and center when identifying key disparate populations and when evaluating future use of evidence-based strategies.Part Five | Selecting Populations and Strategies 24 Partnering for a Healthy New Jersey : Chronic Disease & Health Promotion Plan 2013 - 2018 PART FIVE Selecting Populations and Strategies ADDRESSING HEALTH INEQUITY According to the World Health Organization (WHO), \"health inequities are avoidable inequalities in health between groups of people...Social and economic conditions and their effects on people's lives determine their risk of illness and the actions taken to prevent them becoming ill or treat illness when it occurs.\"30 Few of these factors exist in isolation. For example, a migrant worker is also likely to be an ethnic minority of low economic status. The intersectionality of the social determinants of health increases the likelihood of individuals losing the \"winnable battles\" through no fault of their own. Each of the planning workgroups answered the question, \"What groups of people are most likely to lose the winnable battles?\" The planning process intentionally started with this discussion in order to frame the selection of priority strategies for the future. It was important to keep in mind those groups for whom current policy, environmental, clinical and behavioral strategies have been inadequate in achieving positive health outcomes. A listing of population groups, such as that below, is significant in the planning process in that it points to certain populations that need to be counted (e.g. prisoners), populations that need to have an extra effort made to find them (e.g. rural populations), or those for whom we need to have culturally appropriate materials developed (e.g. low health literacy). All residents deserve access to quality healthcare whether or not they fall into the various groups and categories that emerged from the discussions so \" Disparities in health and healthcare are now viewed not only as an issue of justice, but also as one of quality. During the past 2 decades, one of Healthy People's overarching goals has focused on disparities. In Healthy People 2000, it was to reduce health disparities among Americans. In Healthy People 2010, it was to eliminate, not just reduce, health disparities. In Healthy People 2020, that goal was expanded even further: to achieve health equity, eliminate disparities, and improve the health of all groups.29 \"\"\"\" Part Five | Selecting Populations and Strategies 25 Partnering for a Healthy New Jersey : Chronic Disease & Health Promotion Plan 2013 - 2018 far, but access to quality healthcare comes with special challenges and burdens for these groups. Combining data about disease burden and community knowledge of those groups that experience a disparity in health outcomes, the planning workgroups produced the following list of high-risk populations. Children and youth Those living with a physical and/or mental health di sability The uninsured, underinsured Low-income households Rural & urban residents Racial/ethnic communitiesii Individuals with low literacy skills Seniors New/undocumented i mmigrants/migrant workersiii Inadequate Data The Domain One Epidemiology, Surveillance and Evaluation Workgroup identified populations whose disease burden and modifiable risk factors were most likely to be invisible in the data. Individuals with physical and/or mental health disabilities, children generally, prisoners, veterans, and the LGBT population were specifically identified as having data disparities. While there may be community knowledge about disparate health outcomes for these groups, there is a lack of specific data to track their health outcomes. Future data-improvement strategies should include adequate sampling targets and customized questions to identify potential health disparities for these groups. ii The workgroups identified a variety of specific racial/ethnic groups that experience disparate health outcomes . The goal here was to call attention to the need to take into consideration the specific groups in that community when implementing any evidence -based strategy. iii Note that federal and state funds can not be used to relieve the chronic dise ase burden on these people . Private grants must be acquired in order to address the health disparities for this population. \" Prisoner's disease burden is often \"invisible\" in traditional health data. An April 2013 daily health survey at Monmouth County Corrections revealed 37% of inmates had some form of long- term medical concern requiring treatment (with high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, and cancer high on the list) and 26% had mental health issues. Adapting strategies for different communities will ensure that the needs of high-risk communities are addressed.31 \" Part Five | Selecting Populations and Strategies 26 Partnering for a Healthy New Jersey : Chronic Disease & Health Promotion Plan 2013 - 2018 RESPONDING TO HEALTH INEQUITY As a result of this early and repeated focus on disparate populations, a number of specific strategies for addressing health inequities were highlighted across the domains: Health Literacy The issue of health literacy came up repeatedly. One size does not fit all, especially in New Jersey. Both health system and community providers will need to customize their messages for many different audiences. Multi-channel messaging\u2014print, web-based, oral, and visual\u2014is always more effective than single-channel messaging. Health literacy is not simply the ability to read. It requires a complex group of reading, listening, analytical, and decision-making skills, and the ability to apply these skills to health situations. For example, it includes the ability to understand instructions on prescription drug bottles, appointment slips, medical education brochures, doctors' directions, discharge instructions, consent forms, and the ability to negotiate complex healthcare systems. Urban residents who experience daily trauma and pervasive fear of crime will require health messaging that takes into account their circumstances. Senior citizens will require more than an appointment slip to remember the next appointment. The NJCDPC will continue to work with the Office of Minority and Multicultural Health's Language Access Initiative. That Office has greatly expanded access to Spanish-language health education documents as well as a limited number of other documents in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese and Haitian Creole. The Office has also worked with the New Jersey Hospital Association to create and distribute a Communication Picture Board to help providers better communicate with patients who speak a language other than English. In addition, NJCDCP will coordinate with all partners implementing this Plan to develop customized public messaging that creates an even playing field for all residents in making healthcare and wellness care decisions. Continuity of Care There was also much discussion about the need for self-management and patient Part Five | Selecting Populations and Strategies 27 Partnering for a Healthy New Jersey : Chronic Disease & Health Promotion Plan 2013 - 2018 navigation strategies that are clear, culturally competent, and reflect the daily realities of high- risk populations. Adapting these strategies for different communities and pilot testing a variety of models will ensure that the needs of high-risk communities are addressed in the design and final array of strategy choices. Risk reduction and prevention are key, and patient screenings were specifically referenced as a gateway for disparate populations to enter the system. Workgroups described screenings as a \"teaching moment\" that should be readily available to all populations in traditional and non-traditional settings, and treatment after screenings needs to be easily accessible. Community-based care that is directly and seamlessly linked to local, accessible and culturally competent prevention resources is therefore required.

To establish and improve communication channels to stakeholders and the public at large: Develop statewide user-friendly websites focused on the health and wellness needs of NJ residents; Define and improve the way consumers can find health care providers and community-based wellness services, and the way providers can find up-to-date information on wellness care; Bring the technology infrastructure of state governm ent, especially the Department of Health, in line with its role as a clearinghouse of information and facilitator of public-private partnerships; Develop a strategic communications plan featuring an integrated focus on wellness that ensures common messaging across all sectors and among all stakeholders. This communications plan must include an integrated social media strategy that has both the public and private sector as content providers and administrators; Increase communication links between the State and l ocal health departments; and Develop personal stories and testimonials to convey a Wellness Lifestyle. To improve health literacy for all groups with cultu rally competent products and services: Focus on the end user in developing health and welln ess materials. Customize messages and communications strategies to reach the full range of high-risk disparate populations; and Support healthcare providers through training and in centives in using new techniques for providing culturally appropriate quality care. Collaboration There are and have been many examples of successful partnerships and collaborations in New Jersey. The future goal must be to share power, co-brand efforts, and share expertise to create efficiencies and maximize the most effective features of existing groups. Part Five | Selecting Populations and Strategies 29 Partnering for a Healthy New Jersey : Chronic Disease & Health Promotion Plan 2013 - 2018 Building on past success while unifying efforts through the process of community engagement is much preferable than starting over building all new collaborations and alliances. Past success at collaboration that will inform future success includes the work of: NJ Breathes, in enacting, enhancing, expanding and m onitoring smoke free legislation in New Jersey; The Governor's Task Force on Cancer Prevention, Earl y Detection, and Treatment in their use of \"Choose Your Cover,\" an AHRQ Healthcare Innovation Exchange- recognized skin cancer screening and education program, as the catalyst for enacting stricter regulation of tanning beds; ShapingNJ partners in developing and implementing ne w regulations and policies for child care centers (i.e. nutrition and fitness standards) and maternity hospitals (e.g. supporting breastfeeding); and The Pediatric/Adult Asthma Coalition in supporting New Jersey's Asthma Friendly S chool Award program has reached more than 388,900 students and nearly 29,500 school faculty. To qualify for an award, a school has to fulfill six components, including signing a no-idling pledge for school buses, training school nurses, and having a nebulizer on site. The six components also help schools comply with New Jersey's laws for asthma management and indoor air quality. About 600 schools have received the award since 2006. In 2012, the New Jersey asthma program launched a similar program for child care centers, reaching more than 800 children and more than 200 child care staff. The partnership between New Jersey's Office of Tobac co Control (OTC) and Office of Cancer Control and Prevention (OCCP) resulted in four additional municipal smoke-free outdoor ordinances, impacting about 113,000 residents. The purpose of the collaboration between the OTC and OCCP was to develop strategies aimed at mobilizing the community to raise awareness around the impact of secondhand smoke, and to facilitate the adoption of smoke-free outdoor recreational ordinances through Integrated Municipal Advisory Councils (IMACs). Together, OTC and OCCP grantees launched a collaborated effort for the implementation of the OTC's Smoke-Free Policy Toolkit. The toolkit provides step-by-step guidance for the drafting and development of smoke-free municipal outdoor ordinances, including answers to questions frequently asked by town councils, sample letters and press releases, and strategies to develop and sustain an IMAC. A cross-sector collaboration cosponsored by Region I I Center for Medicare and Medicaid, ShapingNJ and New Jersey's Office of Nutrition and Fitness at the Department of Health was titled \"Bringing the Affordable Care Act Home.\" The all- day meeting held at Rutgers University was attended by over two-hundred people from a wide range of sectors. The goal was to learn and network with other organizations/collaborations working to implement health reform in the state. To that end, breakout groups were organized to highlight challenges and opportunities in the three regions of the state. Experts spoke to a range of topics from electronic records, to reaching the uninsured, to care-coordination success stories.32 The NJ Department of Children & Families, Office of Licensing and the ShapingNJ Child Care Workgroup collaboration in the development and implementation of Part Five | Selecting Populations and Strategies 30 Partnering for a Healthy New Jersey : Chronic Disease & Health Promotion Plan 2013 - 2018 revised child care regulations pertaining to nutrition, physical activity, TV/screen time and breastfeeding support. Just in time for the 2013 baseball season, Horizon B CBSNJ and ShapingNJ opened a new Healthy Plate Concession Stand at Campbell Field, where fans at every game will be able to find nutritious alternatives to the traditional ball park fare. Campbell Field is one of three New Jersey minor league baseball parks where fans can find the Horizon Healthy Plate Concession Stand this season. Stands are also up and running at Arm & Hammer Park (Trenton Thunder) and FirstEnergy Park (Lakewood BlueClaws). Future collaboration is critical to develop a set of seamless, comprehensive health models that are right for New Jersey, through: Developing State, regional and local partnerships to integrate the resources of the government, private and nonprofit sectors into a seamless system of care that is easily accessible, culturally appropriate and sending a common message about wellness; Distinguishing among the FQHC/Community Health Cente r/Patient Center Medical Home models and build on the strengths of each so that high-risk residents can access a full range of health and prevention services in their own community and from a variety of public and private payers; Developing and promoting multiple Patient Navigation models in order to bridge and forge necessary linkages to address both clinical needs and community support for sustaining optimal health and wellness; Enhancing the collaborative use of allied health pro fessionals and paraprofessionals in a team-based approach to care; and Supporting the use of electronic health records and data collaborations to improve practice performance outcomes and support a seamless system of wellness care. Enhancing the engagement of large and small business and industry in growing worksite wellness efforts that lead to better health outcomes and healthcare cost savings. Another clear example of the need for better collabo ration is the need to integrate the activities of several existing coalitions that are internal to state government. The current disease- and risk factor-specific coalitions and planning efforts must be better integrated with the Chronic Disease Advisory Council (CDAC), and future disease- and risk factor-specific plans must be vetted against the integrated priorities in this Plan. See Appendix II for a full list of existing coalitions. Part Five | Selecting Populations and Strategies 31 Partnering for a Healthy New Jersey : Chronic Disease & Health Promotion Plan 2013 - 2018 Figure 6 | Internal Partnership Integration The creation of this Plan includes the understanding that any future chronic disease- specific and risk factor-specific plans will align with the priority strategies, health messaging and high-risk populations included here. While there may be customization for unique circumstances, a core requirement and future mission standard is the focus on prevention, and comprehensive, accessible, seamless health and wellness services across the lifespan. As well, there must be a focus on living well and optimal health, rather than only medical treatment. Part Five | Selecting Populations and Strategies 32 Partnering for a Healthy New Jersey : Chronic Disease & Health Promotion Plan 2013 - 2018 Develop a strong network of partners for implementation of stakeholders' policy priorities Changing policy, whether at the State or institutional level, is a long-term process that requires joint action by a variety of stakeholders. Creating better technology and other mechanisms for communication with partners can ensure that interested parties can find, analyze and support plan identified policy solutions faster and more effectively. As noted above, past policy success in tobacco control, obesity prevention, asthma self-management, and cancer prevention have benefited from strong historical collaborations. A future focus on Health in All Policies (HIAP) to support chronic disease prevention and health promotion as a central consideration in food, environmental, building and land use, transportation, safety and other policy discussions will also benefit from the support of current and future partners. Part Five | Selecting Populations and Strategies 33 Partnering for a Healthy New Jersey : Chronic Disease & Health Promotion Plan 2013 - 2018 GOALS & STRATEGIES BY DOMAIN Domain One: Epidemiology, Surveillance and Evaluation Domain One priorities were defined: \"Gather, analyze, and disseminate data and information and conduct evaluation to inform, prioritize, deliver, and monitor programs and population health.\" Stakeholder-Identified Strategies IMPROVE ACCESS Provide an inventory of reliable data sources; Make translated data available in a user-friendly fo rmat for the spectrum of data users; and Make standardized data available at the county level through county profiles or other formats.

Continuum of Data Users The Domain One Work Group identified a continuum of chronic disease data-users in New Jersey, including individual constituents for change, service providers in health systems, and population-based advocates for change. The activities of each data user group must be considered in order to effectively gather, analyze, and disseminate chronic disease data and information. Therefore, the Domain One Work Group outlined the data each user group is currently using, how the data should be used, and some other related activities that can help to reduce the chronic disease burden in New Jersey. For example, individuals may look for data on diseases for personal decision making and increased knowledge while funders may look for data to support grant developing and evaluation.

Part Six | Resources for Implementation of State Plan 45 Partnering for a Healthy New Jersey : Chronic Disease & Health Promotion Plan 2013 - 2018 PART SIX Resources for Implementation of State Plan BUILDING ON SUCCESS The work of chronic disease prevention and health promotion is not happening in a vacuum. There are a number of state, federal, and private initiatives that directly impact this work and bring both expertise and funding to the implementation of this plan. Below is a list of existing efforts and organization that must be at the core of any future partnership for a healthy New Jersey. The list contained here is not exhaustive but represents the core resources (expertise and funding) available to support plan implementation in New Jersey. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) : CMS has funded and is providing technical assistance for several critical pilot projects under its Innovation Center. Please see Appendix IV for a full listing of NJ CMS projects. Comprehensive Primary Care Initiative : 70 practices, 272 providers, and five payers a re currently working together to test models for improved care coordination. FQHC Advanced Primary Care Practice Demonstration : Seven federally-qualified h ealth center sites in NJ are implementing and testing the medical home model for care coordination. Bundled Payments for Care Improvements (BCPI) : 33 sites in NJ are pilot testing new p ayment models that may lead to higher quality, more coordinated care at a lower cost to Medicare. Community-Based Care Transitions Program (CTCP) : One funded pilot for improving c are transitions from the hospital to other settings and reducing readmissions for high-risk Medicare beneficiaries. State-Level Healthcare Innovation Awards : Six awards to organizations located in or s erving New Jersey for testing new payment and service delivery models that will deliver better care and lower costs for Medicare, Medicaid, and/or CHIP enrollees. Electronic Health Records Incentive Program : Will provide EHR incentive payments to e ligible professionals and eligible hospitals as they adopt, implement, upgrade, or demonstrate Meaningful Use of certified Electronic Health Record (EHR) technology. New Jersey Health Information Technology Extension C enter (NJHITEC) : NJHITEC is w orking with NJ physicians on the selection, implementation, and achievement of Me aningful Use of an accredited Electronic Health Record (EHR) system. This work is partially funded by the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Part Six | Resources for Implementation of State Plan 46 Partnering for a Healthy New Jersey : Chronic Disease & Health Promotion Plan 2013 - 2018 through a grant awarded to the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT). Through this grant, NJ-HITEC is responsible for assisting five thousand Primary Care Providers (PCPs) attain Meaningful Use of an EHR system. Robert Wood Johnson Foundation : There are several current initiatives that are supported by the Foundation that will have a direct impact on plan success. These include but are not limited to: The New Jersey Partnership for Healthy Kids : The goal of the program is to convene, connect, and empower community partnerships across the state to implement environment and policy changing strategies that prevent childhood obesity. Community coalitions in Camden, New Brunswick, Newark Trenton, and Vineland are leading these efforts. Aligning Forces for Quality (AF4Q): The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's goal is to lift the overall quality of healthcare in targeted communities, reduce racial and ethnic disparities and provide models for national reform. While none of the targeted communities are in New Jersey, the lessons learned from this work and other healthcare reform and public health studies sponsored by the Foundation will strongly inform efforts in New Jersey. Coalition for a Healthy NJ : The Coalition for a Healthy NJ works to create healthier communities across New Jersey by building capacity among professionals and community members in a thirteen-county target area. This capacity-building grant serves communities in Atlantic, Burlington, Cape May, Cumberland, Gloucester, Hunterdon, Mercer, Morris, Passaic, Salem, Somerset, Sussex, and Warren. The project is funded through a grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS's) Community Transformation Grants to support public health efforts to reduce chronic diseases, the leading causes of death and disability. The CTG program's goal is to create healthier communities by making healthier living easier and more affordable where people work, live, learn and play. New Jersey Healthcare Quality Institute (NJCHQI) : Their mission is to promote projects and system changes that ensure quality, safety, and cost-containment for patients and consumers. NJCHQI is currently oversees and provides technical support for: The Leapfrog Patient Safety Initiative , which promotes a marketplace in which consumers can easily discern hospital and physician quality and value, and creates a healthcare system in which superior providers are rewarded; Affiliated Accountable Care Organizations (AACO), which serves as a resource for current regional healthcare coalitions that are seeking to become operational Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs), facilitates the growth of new regional Part Six | Resources for Implementation of State Plan 47 Partnering for a Healthy New Jersey : Chronic Disease & Health Promotion Plan 2013 - 2018 healthcare coalitions, and links current and emerging healthcare coalitions to share best practices; NJ Mayor's Wellness Campaign to develop active living initiatives in local communities; The Workplace Wellness Campaign, in partnership with the New Jersey State Chamber of Commerce and the New Jersey Business and Industry Association; and How's Your Health, NJ?, a program to help residents improve their health by fostering better communication with their medical providers and by providing customized preventative care and self-management information to consumers. This project is supported by the State Chamber of Commerce and the State of New Jersey. Other Private Funding and Resource Partners There are several other foundations that currently support work specific to this plan including the Bristol Myers Squibb Foundation (asthma self-management), Campbell Soup Foundation (nutrition and healthy communities) and Nemours Foundation (child care nutrition standards). Private healthcare payers are investing in new continuum of care models that can significantly impact a number of strategies highlighted in the plan. Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield recently announced that fewer hospital admissions and trips to the ED, and better and less costly diabetes care, are among the 2012 results of the patient-centered medical home program of Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey. Horizon said it plans increase enrollment in medical homes, which seek to coordinate medical care in order to improve quality while lowering costs.33 Private organizations such as the Healthcare Institute of New Jersey (representing the research-based biopharmaceutical and medical technology industry in New Jersey), the NJ Business and Industry Association, the New Jersey Hospital Association, and the Medical Society of New Jersey all have access to important data and expertise that can support plan implementation and evaluation. Federal Funding for Chronic Disease Prevention and Control The President's FY14 budget request includes \"a new, competitive cooperative agreement program that refocuses activities from disease-specific programs into a more comprehensive approach. Because many chronic disease conditions share common risk factors, the new program will improve health outcomes by coordinating the interventions that can reduce the Part Six | Resources for Implementation of State Plan 48 Partnering for a Healthy New Jersey : Chronic Disease & Health Promotion Plan 2013 - 2018 overall burden of chronic disease. CDC will award grants to health departments to implement evidence-based strategies and will address the leading causes of death and health disparities. In addition, CDC will award grants to academic health centers to develop, test, and evaluate effective interventions to reduce chronic conditions; and to national organizations to provide technical assistance, training, and support to health departments. CDC will provide performance awards for states that significantly improve health outcomes.\"34 The President's proposed budget \"eliminates duplicative community grant programs and the Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant. CDC will address the goals of these activities through the new comprehensive grants program and new Community Transformation Grants funded through the Prevention Fund...[and consolidate] the Asthma, Childhood Lead Poisoning Program, and Healthy Homes programs into one comprehensive program.\"34 State Funding for Chronic Disease Prevention and Control Like many states, much of the funding for public health and chronic disease prevention originates at the federal level and is passed through to numerous state departments. Investments of direct state aid for chronic disease prevention are in the NJDOH FY2014 budget for specific diseases and modifiable risk factors, including funding for cancer research, cancer screening, breast cancer awareness, obesity prevention pilot grants, diabetes self- management, and worksite wellness programs for small businesses. The fiscal year 2014 budget provides $20 million in new funding specifically for cancer research and treatment and to support the state's Cancer Programs. There are also related resources to support plan strategy implementation through the Departments of Transportation, Banking & Insurance, Human Services (Divisions of Aging and Medical Assistance & Health Services) and Agriculture. New Jersey already has one of the most expansive and generous Medicaid programs in the nation, including the second-highest eligibility rate for children. Expanding Medicaid will mean that more New Jerseyans at or near the poverty line will have access to critical health services, while saving New Jersey taxpayers approximately $227 million in fiscal year 2014. Nursing homes will see their Medicaid reimbursement increase by $10.3 million in State funding ($20.6 million with matching federal funds), providing them with additional resources as New Jersey begins its transition to managed long-term services.Part Seven | Evaluation 49 Partnering for a Healthy New Jersey : Chronic Disease & Health Promotion Plan 2013 - 2018 PART SEVEN Evaluation CORE INDICATORS OF SUCCESS The evaluation standards directly reflect Healthy New Jersey 2020 objectives35 for the related burden of chronic disease and modifiable risk factors. These targets will become the preliminary long-term goals for the plan. During the development of HNJ2020 , numerous data gap areas were identified. Collaboration between state and local public health officials, academia, and private health organizations will be required to close the data gaps and better inform health improvement activities statewide. An inventory of all data gaps is currently being drafted by the NJDOH Healthy New Jersey Coordinating Committee.

2018 Over the course of the next year, the Epidemiology, Surveillance and Evaluation Workgroup will create final domain-specific logic models and an evaluation plan to track implementation and impact. It will also identify other missing core health indicators at both the state and local level, which reflect the shift to a focus on wellness. Reducing the burden of diseases and reducing risk factors must be combined with increasing protective factors: \"winning the winnable battles.\" Some Healthy New Jersey 2020 objectives do not currently have baseline data but will become available in the period covered by HNJ 2020. PLAN EVALUATION PROCESSES Plan evaluation is a core backbone function for the NJCDPC Unit even though plan evaluation activities will require the expertise and effort of a wide variety of public and private partners and a shared data system. Unlike grant evaluation, plan evaluation depends on the voluntary participation of stakeholders and must be designed in a manner that meets the needs of many different stakeholders. The Epidemiology, Surveillance and Evaluation Workgroup will continue to meet and will design an integrated evaluation process that captures: Key process and short-term outcome data for each lis ted strategy that documents adaptations made for reaching and engaging disparate populations, lessons learned from pilot implementation, and core levels of service (i.e. the number of complete street policies adopted, the number of CHWs trained, and the number of private practices achieving meaningful use of EHR systems); Core health indicators that measure interim progress in improving health outcomes (i.e. blood pressure, A1C, BMI , increase in physical activity); Long-term progress on reducing disease burden overal l and health disparities for targeted groups; and Indicators of collaboration on plan implementation, and evaluation functions, including the development of integrated evaluation tools for use with all internal and external partnerships. We will build on the evaluation tools used by Pediat ric/Adult Asthma Coalition of New Jersey (PACNJ) & ShapingNJ to develop an integrated partnership assessment tool for the \" In 2013, NJ-AEEP received the NACP Evaluation Award for its State Asthma Partnership Assessment. This assessment was initiated by the AAEP Evaluation Team comprised of members from NJDOH, PACNJ, and Rutgers University. Its mission is to address and plan evaluation strategies for the Asthma Program. \" Part Seven | Evaluation 55 Partnering for a Healthy New Jersey : Chronic Disease & Health Promotion Plan 2013 - 2018 future. The Workgroup will create a plan that involves a broad range of partners in routinely capturing and sharing additional core indicators of success: Government, community, worksite, school, and faith c ommunity environments that have policies and practices to promote and reinforce healthful behaviors and practices across the life span; Meaningful use of EHR systems in public and private settings; Hospital readmissions across all disease c ategories; Health literacy: the degree to which an i ndividual has the capacity to obtain, communicate, process, and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions; Easy and seamless access to care in local c ommunities and services available where they live, work, pray, and play; Policy implementation that extends c urrent policies into new settings; Data on existing HNJ 2020 targets where c urrent data is not yet available; and All health indicators for high-risk d isparate populations identified in the plan. The goal of evaluation efforts is to inform continuo us quality improvement over the term of the plan. As such, it will be important to implement a strong and timely feedback loop between partners and a venue for discussion and establishment of corrective action plans as needed. It is expected that plan progress will be reported annually at an overall partnership meeting, bringing together all the individuals and organizations that developed this plan and will participate in implementation. \" ShapingNJ is the obesity prevention public-private partnership that was designed to make the healthy choice the easy choice in New Jersey. This partnership was evaluated each of the last three years using the Wilder Collaboration Inventory and findings were used to develop quality improvement plans each year. \" Part Eight | Messaging / Communication Plan 56 Partnering for a Healthy New Jersey : Chronic Disease & Health Promotion Plan 2013 - 2018 PART EIGHT Messaging/Communication Plan Health promotion requires individual and population-based strategies that address health disparities in culturally relevant and culturally sensitive ways. Health promotion also requires common messaging to support community systems, norms, and values around health and wellness. At our final full stakeholder planning meeting in July 2013, it was clear that a common style guide will need to be developed to support consistent messaging among all stakeholders. There are still several concepts relevant to the paradigm shift where the language used varies by field and would benefit from more discussion and clarification. Some of these concepts include: Living well with chronic disease (optimal health wit h both self and clinical management); Making the healthy choice the easy choice (populatio n based primary prevention efforts); Expanding the continuum of the care paradigm to incl ude both clinical care in traditional health systems and preventive/wellness care in the community; Winnable battles; Health inequity and health disparities; and Terminology for new innovations in care models: pati ent-centered medical homes, accountable care, and comprehensive community health systems. A major overarching task for Year One is the develop ment of a Strategic Communications Plan featuring an integrated focus on wellness that ensures this common messaging across all sectors and among all stakeholders. As noted in the beginning section of this Plan and from all the workgroups, any communications strategy in New Jersey must break through the noise of the New York and Philadelphia media markets. Messages specifically targeted to New Jersey residents will need to use alternative communication channels and common messaging from all partners. The use of social media and web-based tools by both the public and private sector will be critical. Integrating our efforts as content providers and administrators for these tools must become a top partnership priority. Part Nine | Future Role of the NJCDPC 57 Partnering for a Healthy New Jersey : Chronic Disease & Health Promotion Plan 2013 - 2018 PART NINE Future Role of the NJCDPC Partnering for a Healthy New Jersey aptly names the key role of the NJCDPC Unit in building seamless and integrated chronic disease prevention systems. At all levels (i.e. local, county, cross-county, state) and within all sectors (i.e. government, non-profit, private), chronic disease prevention and health promotion activities are taking place in New Jersey. Based on input from the planning workgroups though, there is little coordination and a resultant concern for potential gaps of coverage and possible redundancy. Stakeholders repeatedly expressed concern about the lack of information available about the efficacy of these programs and that consumers, the end-user, often get lost as they try to navigate the health system. Therefore, a key function for the NJCDPC Unit is to act as the coordinator by inventorying and categorizing the myriad of initiatives and services available in the State. It will then be a supporter of current and future growth in practices and policies by identifying gaps, potential growth, best practices, and change agents. It will support and encourage evaluation and implementers of successful initiatives. With partners, it will develop and provide toolkits for effective strategies. It will be a resource agent as it collates and disseminates positive efforts ranging from grass roots activities to policy improvements and a leveraging agent as it seeds innovation and works with private funders to take new initiatives to scale. It will coordinate evaluation as it tracks evidence-based efforts to increase the return on investment. It will support and encourage research and track the desired changes in health status of high-risk disparate populations. It will communicate with all partners so that they stay informed during major changes in the fields of healthcare and prevention. It will also ensure that appropriate and effective communication is provided for consumers so they can make healthcare and daily life decisions that support wellness. Stakeholders raised the issue that partnerships frequently falter because no one group has the specific charge to unite and facilitate the required host of activities. The NJCDPC Unit is Part Nine | Future Role of the NJCDPC 58 Partnering for a Healthy New Jersey : Chronic Disease & Health Promotion Plan 2013 - 2018 ideally suited to bridge the activities within and beyond State government under a common wellness goal. The NJCDPC Unit is also positioned to provide specific coordinating functions of gathering information, providing the time and space for aligning partner activities, establishing shared measurement, mobilizing public-private resources and communicating both to the consumer as well as to healthcare and community prevention partners. Finally, the NJCDPC Unit will be a champion for keeping health in all policies by identifying opportunities for stronger public-private partnerships within multiple government agencies and policy-making bodies at the local, county, and state level.

Chronic Disease Advisory Council : The Chronic Disease Advisory Council (CDAC) includes DOH Commissioner appointed members representing a wide range of constituents including healthcare providers, government agencies, professional organizations, healthcare organizations, and minority health groups. The purpose of CDAC is to act in an advisory capacity in the areas of chronic disease prevention, detection, and treatment. Regional Chronic Disease Coalitions : New Jersey has 10 regional chronic disease coalitions that receive funding through the New Jersey DOH's Office of Cancer Control and Prevention. These coalitions originated from the State's 21 county cancer coalitions and were recently consolidated into regional coalitions that are engaged in both comprehensive cancer control efforts and chronic disease interventions. Governor's Task Force on Cancer Prevention, Early De tection, and Treatment : This task force is comprised of a wide range of experts charged with addressing the impact of cancer on New Jersey citizens. Several workgroups and committees were developed as an extension of this task force and are currently working to implement the New Jersey Comprehensive Cancer Control Plan. The New Jersey State Commission on Cancer Research ( NJCCR) promotes significant and original research in New Jersey into the causes, prevention and treatment of cancer and serves as a resource to providers and consumers of cancer services. Pediatric/Adult Asthma Coalition of New Jersey (PACN J): The Pediatric/Adult Asthma Coalition of New Jersey is sponsored by the American Lung Association of the Mid-Atlantic and receives funding from the New Jersey DOH's Asthma Awareness and Education Program. The PACNJ has over 70 members and is currently working with schools, child care providers, healthcare providers, health insurers, community groups and environmental agencies to reduce the burden of asthma in New Jersey. NJBreathes : New Jersey Breathes is a coalition of organizations from public, private, government and non-profit sectors interested in decreasing tobacco use in the State. Membership for this coalition includes many existing State partners such as the American Cancer Society, New Jersey Global Advisors on Smoke-Free Policy, and the Southern New Jersey Perinatal Cooperative. Rural Health Advisory Committee : The Rural Health Advisory Council serves as a statewide resource for rural health concerns, to improve rural health, and to foster available and accessible health services for rural New Jerseyans.
