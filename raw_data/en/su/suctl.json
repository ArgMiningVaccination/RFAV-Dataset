Our Common Future Chairman's Foreword From A/42/427. Our Common Future: Report of the World Co mmission on Environment and Development \"A global agenda for change\" - this was what the Wo rld Commission on Environment and Development was asked to formulate. It was an urgent call by the Ge neral Assembly of the United Nations: to propose long-term environmental strategies for achieving sustainable development by the year 2000 and beyond; to recommend ways concern for the environment may be translated into greater co-operation among developing countries and between countries at diffe rent stages of economical and social development and lead to the achievement of common and mutually supportive objectives that take account of the interrelationships between people, resources, envir onment, and development; to consider ways and means by which the internatio nal community can deal more effectively with environment concerns; and to help define shared perceptions of long-term env ironmental issues and the appropriate efforts neede d to deal successfully with the problems of protectin g and enhancing the environment, a long term agenda for action during the coming decades, and aspiratio nal goals for the world community. When I was called upon by the Secretary-General of the United Nations in December 1983 to establish an d chair a special, independent commission to address this major challenge to the world community, I was acutely aware that this was no small task and obligation, a nd that my day-to day responsibilities as Party lea der made it seem plainly prohibitive. What the General Assembly asked for also seemed to be unrealistic and much t oo ambitious. At the same time, it was a clear demonst ration of the widespread feeling of frustration and inadequacy in the international community about our own ability to address the vital global issues and deal effectively with them. The fact is a compelling reality, and should not ea sily be dismissed. Since the answers to fundamental and serious concerns are not at hand, there is no alter native but to keep on trying to find them. All this was on my mind when the Secretary-General presented me with an argument to which there was no convincing rebuttal: No other political leader had become Prime Minister with a background of several years of political struggle, nationally and internationally, as an environment minister. This gave some hope th at the environment was not destined to remain a side issue in central, political decision making. In the final analysis, I decided to accept the chal lenge. The challenge of facing the future, and of s afeguarding the interests of coming generations. For it was abu ndantly clear: We needed a mandate for change. We live in an era in the history of nations when th ere is greater need than ever for co-ordinated poli tical action and responsibility. The United Nations and its Secr etary-General are faced with an enormous task and b urden. Responsibly meeting humanity's goals and aspiration s will require the active support of us all. My reflections and perspective were also based on o ther important parts of ray own political experienc e: the preceding work of the Brandt Commission on North So uth issues, and the Palme Commission on security an d disarmament issues, on which I served. I was being asked to help formulate a third and com pelling call for political action: After Brandt's P rogramme for Survival and Common Crisis, and after Palme's Commo n Security, would come Common Future. This was my message when Vice Chairman Mansour Khalid and I sta rted work on the ambitious task set up by the Unite d Nations. This report, as presented to the UN Genera l Assembly in 1987, is the result of that process. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. Perhaps our most urgent task today is to persuade n ations of the need to return to multilateralism. Th e challenge of reconstruction after the Second World War was the real motivating power behind the establishment of our post-war international economi c system. The challenge of finding sustainable development paths ought to provide the impetus - in deed the imperative - for a renewed search for mult ilateral solutions and a restructured international economic system of co-operation. These challenges cut acros s the divides of national sovereignty, of limited strateg ies for economic gain, and of separated disciplines of science. After a decade and a half of a standstill or even d eterioration in global co-operation, I believe the time has come for higher expectations, for common goals pursued t ogether, for an increased political will to address our common future. There was a time of optimism and progress in the 19 60s, when there was greater hope for a braver new w orld, and for progressive international ideas. Colonies b lessed with natural resources were becoming nations . The locals of co-operation and sharing seemed to be ser iously pursued. Paradoxically, the 1970s slid slowl y into moods of reaction and isolation while at the same t ime a series of UN conferences offered hope for gre ater co- operation on major issues. The 1972 UN Conference on the Human Environment brought the industrialized and developing nations together to delineate the \"right s\" of the human family to a healthy and productive environment. A string of such meetings followed: on the rights of people to adequate food, to sound ho using, to safe water, to access to means of choosing the size of their families. The present decade has been marked by a retreat fro m social concerns. Scientists bring to our attentio n urgent but complex problems bearing on our very survival: a warming globe, threats to the Earth's ozone layer , deserts consuming agricultural land. We respond by demandin g more details, and by assigning the problems to institutions ill-equipped to cope with them. Enviro nmental degradation, first seen as mainly a problem of the rich nations and a side effect of industrial wealth, has become a survival issue for developing nations. It is part of the downward spiral of linked ecological and econom ic decline in which many of the poorest nations are trapped. Despite official hope expressed on all sid es, no trends identifiable today, no programmes or policies, offer any real hope of narrowing the growing gap be tween rich and poor nations. And as part of our \"development\", we have amassed weapons arsenals cap able of diverting the paths that evolution has foll owed for millions of years and of creating a planet our ancestors would not recognize. When the terms of reference of our Commission were originally being discussed in 1982, there were thos e who wanted its considerations to be limited to \"environ mental issues\" only. This would have been a grave m istake. The environment does not exist as a sphere separate from human actions, ambitions, and needs, and atte mpts to defend it in isolation from human concerns have given the very word \"environment\" a connotation of naivety in some political circles. The word \"development\" h as also been narrowed by some into a very limited f ocus, along the lines of \"what poor nations should do to become richer\", and thus again is automatically dis missed by many in the international arena as being a concern of specialists, of those involved in questions of \"development assistance\". But the \"environment\" is where we all live; and \"de velopment\" is what we all do in attempting to impro ve our lot within that abode. The two are inseparable. Further , development issues must be seen as crucial by the political leaders who feel that their countries hav e reached a plateau towards which other nations mus t strive. Many of the development paths of the industrialized nations are clearly unsustainable. And the develop ment decisions of these countries, because of their grea t economic and political power, will have a profoun d effect upon the ability of all peoples to sustain human pr ogress for generations to come. Many critical survival issues are related to uneven development, poverty, and population growth. They all place unprecedented pressures on the planet's lands, wate rs, forests, and other natural resources, not least in the developing countries. The downward spiral of povert y and environmental degradation is a waste of opportunities and of resources. In particular, it i s a waste of human resources. These links between p overty, inequality, and environmental degradation formed a major theme in our analysis and recommendations. Wh at is needed now is a new era of economic growth - gro wth that is forceful and at the same time socially and environmentally sustainable. Due to the scope of our work, and to the need to ha ve a wide perspective. I was very much aware of the need to put together a highly qualified and influential political and scientific team, to constitute a trul y independent Commission. This was an essential part of a success ful process. Together, we should span the globe, an d pull United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. together to formulate an interdisciplinary, integra ted approach to global concerns and our common futu re. We needed broad participation and a clear majority of members from developing countries, to reflect world realities. We needed people with wide experience, and from all political fields, not only from environment or dev elopment and political disciplines, but from all areas of vi tal decision making that influence economic and soc ial progress, nationally and internationally. We therefore come from widely differing backgrounds : foreign ministers, finance and planning officials , policymakers in agriculture, science, and technolog y. Many of the Commissioners are cabinet ministers and senior economists in their own nations, concerned l argely with the affairs of those countries. As Commissioners, however, we were acting not in our n ational roles but as individuals; and as we worked, nationalism and the artificial divides between \"ind ustrialized\" and \"developing\", between East and Wes t, receded. In their place emerged a common concern fo r the planet and the interlocked ecological and eco nomic threats with which its people, institutions, and go vernments now grapple. During the time we met as a Commission, tragedies s uch as the African famines, the leak at the pestici des factory at Bhopal, India, and the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl, USSR appeared to justify the grave pr edictions about the human future that were becoming commonpla ce during the mid-1980s. But at public hearings we held on five continents, we also heard from the ind ividual victims of more chronic, widespread disaste rs: the debt crisis, stagnating aid to and investment in de veloping countries, falling commodity prices and fa lling personal incomes. We became convinced that major ch anges were needed, both in attitudes and in the way our societies are organized. The question of population - of population pressure , of population and human rights - and the links be tween these related issues and poverty, environment, and development proved to be one of the more difficult concerns with which we had to struggle. The differe nces of perspective seemed at the outset to be unbridgeable, and they required a lot of thought an d willingness to communicate across the divides of cultures, religions, and regions. Another such concern was the whole area of internat ional economic relations. In these and in a number of other important aspects of our analysis and recomme ndations, we were able to develop broad agreement. The fact that we all became wiser, learnt to look a cross cultural and historical barriers, was essenti al. There were moments of deep concern and potential crisis, moments of gratitude and achievement, moments of success in building a common analysis and perspecti ve. The result is clearly more global, more realist ic, more forward looking than any one of us alone could have created. We joined the Commission with different v iews and perspectives, different values and beliefs, and very different experiences and insights. After the se three years of working together, travelling, listening, a nd discussing, we present a unanimous report. I am deeply grateful to all the Commissioners for t heir dedication, their foresight and personal commi tment to our common endeavour. It has been a truly wonderful team. The spirit of friendship and open communicat ion, the meeting of minds and the process of learning an d sharing, have provided an experience of optimism, something of great value to all of us, and, I belie ve, to the report and its message. We hope to share with others our learning process, and all that we have e xperienced together. It is something that many othe rs will have to experience if global sustainable developmen t is to be achieved. The Commission has taken guidance from people in al l walks of life. It is to these people - to all the peoples of the world - that the Commission now addresses itsel f. In so doing we speak to people directly as well as to the institutions that they have established. The Commission is addressing governments, directly and through their various agencies and ministries. The congregation of governments, gathered in the Genera l Assembly of the United Nations, will be the main recipients of this report. The Commission is also addressing private enterpris e, from the one-person business to the great multin ational company with a total economic turnover greater than that of many nations, and with possibilities for b ringing about far-reaching changes and improvements. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. But first and foremost our message is directed towa rds people, whose well being is the ultimate goal o f all environment and development policies. In particular , the Commission is addressing the young. The world 's teachers will have a crucial role to play in bringi ng this report to them. If we do not succeed in putting our message of urge ncy through to today's parents and decision makers, we risk undermining our children's fundamental right t o a healthy, life-enhancing environment. Unless we are able to translate our words into a language that can rea ch the minds and hearts of people young and old, we shall not be able to undertake the extensive social chang es needed to correct the course of development. The Commission has completed its work. We call for a common endeavour and for new norms of behaviour a t all levels and in the interests of all. The changes in attitudes, in social values, and in aspirations that the report urges will depend on vast campaigns of education, d ebate and public participation. To this end, we appeal to \"citizens\" groups, to non governmental organizations, to educational institu tions, and to the scientific community. They have all played i ndispensable roles in the creation of public awaren ess and political change in the past. They will play a cruc ial part in putting the world onto sustainable deve lopment paths, in laying the groundwork for Our Common Futu re. The process that produced this unanimous report pro ven that it is possible to join forces, to identify common goals, and to agree on common action. Each one of t he Commissioners would have chosen different words if writing the report alone. Still, we managed to agre e on the analysis, the broad remedies, and the recommendations for a sustainable course of develop ment. In the final analysis, this is what it amounts to: furthering the common understanding and common spir it of responsibility so clearly needed in a divided world . Thousands of people all over the world have contrib uted to the work of the Commission, by intellectual means, by financial means, and by sharing their experience s with us through articulating their needs and dema nds. I am sincerely grateful to everyone who has made such contributions. Many of their names are found in Annexe 2 of the report. My particular gratitude goes to Vic e Chairman Mansour Khalid, to all the other members of the Commission, and to Secretary-General Jim MacNeill a nd his staff at our secretariat, who went above and beyond the call of duty to assist us. Their enthusi asm and dedication knew no limits. I want to thank the chairmen and members of the Intergovernmental Inter -sessional Preparatory Committee, who co-operated closely with the Commission and provided inspiratio n and support. I thank also the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme, Dr. Mostafa T olba, for his valuable, continuous support and inte rest.

A Call for Action United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 1. In the middle of the 20th century, we saw our pl anet from space for the first time. Historians may eventually find that this vision had a greater impact on thoug ht than did the Copernican revolution of the 16th c entury, which upset the human self-image by revealing that the Earth is not the centre of the universe. From s pace, we see a small and fragile ball dominated not by human activity and edifice but by a pattern of clouds, o ceans, greenery, and soils. Humanity's inability to fit it s activities into that pattern is changing planetar y systems, fundamentally. Many such changes are accompanied by life-threatening hazards. This new reality, from w hich there is no escape, must be recognized - and manage d. 2. Fortunately, this new reality coincides with mor e positive developments new to this century. We can move information and goods faster around the globe than ever before; we can produce more food and more good s with less investment of resources; our technology a nd science gives us at least, the potential to look deeper into and better understand natural systems. From sp ace, we can see and study the Earth as an organism whose health depends on the health of al its parts. We have the power to reconcile human affairs with natural laws and to thrive in the process. In this our cult ural and spiritual heritages can reinforce our econ omic interests and survival imperatives. 3. This Commission believes that people can build a future that is more prosperous, more just, and mor e secure. Our report, Our Common Future , is not a prediction of ever increasing environmen tal decay, poverty, and hardship in an ever more polluted world among e ver decreasing resources. We see instead the possib ility for a new era of economic growth, one that must be based on policies that sustain and expand the environmental resource base. And we believe such gr owth to be absolutely essential to relieve the grea t poverty that is deepening in much of the developing world. 4. But the Commission's hope for the future is cond itional on decisive political action now to begin m anaging environmental resources to ensure both sustainable human progress and human survival. We are not forecasting a future; we are serving a notice - an urgent notice based on the latest and best scientif ic evidence - that the time has come to take the decisions needed to secure the resources to sustain this and coming generations. We do not offer a detailed blueprint f or action, but instead a pathway by which the peopl es of the world may enlarge their spheres of cooperation. I. The Global Challenge 1. Successes and failures 5. Those looking for success and signs of hope can find many: infant mortality is falling; human life expectancy is increasing; the proportion of the world's adults who can read and write is climbing; the proportion of children starting school is rising; and global food producti on increases faster than the population grows. 6. But the same processes that have produced these gains have given rise to trends that the planet and its people cannot long bear. These have traditionally b een divided into failures of 'development' and fail ures in the management of our human environment. On the develop ment side, in terms of absolute numbers there are more hungry people in the world than ever before, a nd their numbers are increasing. So are the numbers who cannot read or write, the numbers without safe wate r or safe and sound homes, and the numbers short of woodfuel with which to cook and warm themselves. Th e gap between rich and poor nations is widening - n ot shrinking - and there is little prospect, given pre sent trends and institutional arrangements, that th is process will be reversed. 7. There are also environmental trends that threate n to radically alter the planet, that threaten the lives of many species upon it. including the human species. Each year another 6 million hectares of productive dryla nd turns into worthless desert. Over three decades, this wou ld amount to an area roughly as large as Saudi Arab ia. More than 11 million hectares of forests are destro yed yearly, and this, over three decades, would equ al an area about the size of India. Much of this forest i s converted to low-grade farmland unable to support the farmers who settle it. In Europe, acid precipitatio n kills forests and lakes and damages the artistic and architectural heritage of nations; it may have acid ified vast tracts of soil beyond reasonable hope of repair. The burning of fossil fuels puts into the atmosphere ca rbon dioxide, which is causing gradual global warmi ng. This 'greenhouse effect' may by early next century have increased average global temperatures enough to shi ft agricultural production areas, raise sea levels to flood coastal cities, and disrupt national economie s. Other United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. industrial gases threaten to deplete the planet's p rotective ozone shield to such an extent that the n umber of human and animal cancers would rise sharply and the oceans' food chain would be disrupted, industry an d agriculture put toxic substances into the human foo d chain and into underground water tables beyond re ach of cleansing. 8. There has been a growing realization in national governments and multilateral institutions that it is impossible to separate economic development issues from enviro nment issues; many forms of development erode the environmental resources upon which they must be bas ed, and environmental degradation can undermine economic development. Poverty is a major cause and effect of global environmental problems. It is ther efore futile to attempt to deal with environmental proble ms without a broader perspective that encompasses t he factors underlying world poverty and international inequality. 9. These concerns were behind the establishment in 1983 of the World Commission on Environment and Development by the UN General Assembly. The Commiss ion is an independent body, linked to but outside t he control of governments and the UN system. The Commi ssion's mandate gave it three objectives: to re-exa mine the critical environment and development issues and to formulate realistic proposals for dealing with them; to propose new forms of international cooperation on t hese issues that will influence policies and events in the direction of needed changes; and to raise the level s of understanding and commitment to action of indi viduals, voluntary organizations, businesses, institutes, an d governments. 10. Through our deliberations and the testimony of people at the public hearings we held on five conti nents, all the commissioners came to focus on one central them e: many present development trends leave increasing numbers of people poor and vulnerable, while at the same time degrading the environment. How can such development serve next century's world of twice as many people relying on the same environment? This realization broadened our view of development. We c ame to see it not in its restricted context of econ omic growth in developing countries. We came to see that a new development path was required, one that sust ained human progress not just in a few pieces for a few y ears, but for the entire planet into the distant fu ture. Thus 'sustainable development' becomes a goal not just f or the 'developing' nations, but for industrial one s as well. 2. The Interlocking Crises 11. Until recently, the planet was a large world in which human activities and their effects were neat ly compartmentalized within nations, within sectors (e nergy, agriculture, trade), and within broad areas of concern (environment, economics, social). These compartment s have begun to dissolve. This applies in particula r to the various global 'crises' that have seized public con cern, particularly over the past decade. These are not separate crises: an environmental crisis, a develop ment crisis, an energy crisis. They are all one. 12. The planet is passing through a period of drama tic growth and fundamental change. Our human world of 5 billion must make room in a finite environment for another human world. The population could stabilize at between 8 and 14 billion sometime next century, acc ording to UN projections. More than 90 per cent of the increase will occur in the poorest countries, and 9 0 per cent of that growth in already bursting citie s. 13. Economic activity has multiplied to create a $1 3 trillion world economy, and this could grow five to tenfold in the coming half century. Industrial production has grown more than fiftyfold over the past century, fo ur-fifths of this growth since 1950. Such figures reflect and pr esage profound impacts upon the biosphere, as the w orld invests in houses, transport, farms, and industries . Much of the economic growth pulls raw material fr om forests, soils, seas, and waterways. The World Commission on Environment and Development first met in October 1984. and published its Repor t 900 days later, in April 1987. Over those few days: The drought-triggered, environment-development cri sis in Africa peaked, putting 36 million people at risk, killing perhaps a million. A leak from a pesticides factory in Bhopal, India, killed more than 2,000 people and blinded and inju red over 200,000 more. Liquid gas tanks exploded in Mexico City, killing 1,000 and leaving thousands more homeless. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. The Chernobyl nuclear reactor explosion sent nucle ar fallout across Europe, increasing the risks of f uture human cancers. Agricultural chemicals, solvents, and mercury flow ed into the Rhine River during a warehouse fire in Switzerland, killing millions of fish and threateni ng drinking water in the Federal Republic of German y and the Netherlands. An estimated 60 million people died of diarrhoeal diseases related to unsafe drinking water and malnutrition; most of the victims were children. 14. A mainspring of economic growth is new technolo gy, and while this technology offers the potential for slowing the dangerously rapid consumption of finite resources, it also entails high risks, including n ew forms of pollution and the introduction to the planet of new variations of life forms that could change evoluti onary pathways. Meanwhile, the industries most heavily re liant on environmental resources and most heavily p olluting are growing most rapidly in the developing world, w here there is both more urgency for growth and less capacity to minimize damaging side effects. 15. These related changes have locked the global ec onomy and global ecology together in new ways. We h ave in the past been concerned about the impacts of eco nomic growth upon the environment. We are now force d to concern ourselves with the impacts of ecological st ress - degradation of soils, water regimes, atmosph ere, and forests upon our economic prospects. We have in the more recent past been forced to face up to a sharp increase in economic interdependence among nations. We are now forced to accustom ourselves to an accelerating ecological interdependence among natio ns. Ecology and economy are becoming ever more interwoven locally, regionally, nationally, and glo bally into a seamless net of causes and effects. 16. Impoverishing the local resource base can impov erish wider areas: deforestation by highland farmer s causes flooding on lowland farms; factory pollution robs local fishermen of their catch. Such grim loc al cycles now operate nationally and regionally. Dryland degr adation sends environmental refugees in their milli ons across national borders. Deforestation in Latin Ame rica and Asia is causing more floods, and more dest ructive floods, in downhill, downstream nations. Acid preci pitation and nuclear fallout have spread across the borders of Europe. Similar phenomena are emerging on a glob al scale, such as global warming and loss of ozone. Internationally traded hazardous chemicals entering foods are themselves internationally traded. In th e next century, the environmental pressure causing populat ion movements may be increase sharply, while barrie rs to that movement may be even firmer than they are now. 17. Over the past few decades, life-threatening env ironmental concerns have surfaced in the developing world. Countrysides are coming under pressure from increas ing numbers of farmers and the landless. Cities are filling with people, cars, and factories. Yet at the same t ime these developing countries oust operate in a wo rld in which the resources gap between most developing and industrial nations is widening, in which the indus trial world dominates in the rule-making of some key inte rnational bodies and in which the industrial world has already used much of the planet's ecological capita l. This inequality is the planet's main 'environmen tal' problem; it is also its main 'development' problem. 18. International economic relationships pose a par ticular problem for environmental management in man y developing countries. Agriculture, forestry, energy production, and mining generate at least half the gross national product of many developing countries and a ccount for even larger shares of livelihoods and employment. Exports of natural resources remain a l arge factor in their economies, especially for the least developed. Most of these countries face enormous ec onomic pressures, both international and domestic, to overexploit their environmental resource base. 19. The recent crisis in Africa best and most tragi cally illustrates the ways in which economics and e cology can interact destructively and trip into disaster. Trig gered by drought, its real causes lie deeper. They are to be found in part in national policies that gave too li ttle attention, too late, to the needs of smallhold er agriculture and to the threats posed by rapidly rising populati ons. Their roots extend also to a global economic s ystem that takes more out of a poor continent than it puts in. Debts that they cannot pay force African nations r elying on commodity sales to overuse their fragile soils, thu s turning good land to desert. Trade barriers in th e wealthy nations - and in many developing nations - make it hard for African nations to sell their goods for re asonable United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. returns, putting yet more pressure on ecological sy stems. Aid from donor nations has not only been ina dequate in scale, but too often has reflected the prioritie s of the nations giving the aid, rather than the ne eds of the recipients. The Commission has sought ways in which global deve lopment can be put on a sustainable path into the 2 1st Century. Some 5,000 days will elapse between the pu blication of our report and the first day of the 21 st Century. What environmental crises lie in store ove r those 5,000 days? During the 1970s, twice as many people suffered eac h year from 'natural' disasters as during the 1960s . The disasters most directly associated with environment /development mismanagement - droughts and floods - affected the most people and increased most sharply in terms of numbers affected. Some 18.5 million pe ople were affected by drought annually in the 1960s, 24. 4 million in the 1970s. There were 5.2 million floo d victims yearly in the 1960s, 15.4 million in the 1970s. Num bers of victims of cyclones and earthquakes also sh ot up as growing numbers of poor people built unsafe houses on dangerous ground. The results are not in for the 1960s. But we have s een 35 billion afflicted by drought in Africa alone and tens of millions affected by the better managed and thus le ss-publicized Indian drought. Floods have poured of f the deforested Andes and Himalayas with increasing forc e. The 1960s seem destined to sweep this dire trend on into a crisis-filled 1990s. 20. The production base of other developing world a reas suffers similarly from both local failures and from the workings of international economic systems. As a co nsequence of the 'debt crisis' of Latin America, th at continent's natural resources are now being used no t for development but to meet financial obligations to creditors abroad. This approach to the debt problem is short-sighted from several standpoints: economi c, political, and environmental. It requires relativel y poor countries simultaneously to accept growing p overty while exporting growing amounts of scarce resources. 21. A majority of developing countries now have low er per capita incomes than when the decade began. R ising poverty and unemployment have increased pressure on environmental resources as more people have been forced to rely more directly upon them. Many govern ments have cut back efforts to protect the environm ent and to bring ecological considerations into development planning. 22. The deepening and widening environmental crisis presents a threat to national security - and even survival - that may be greater than well-armed, ill-disposed n eighbours and unfriendly alliances. Already in part s of Latin America, Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, environ mental decline is becoming a source of political un rest and international tension. The recent destruction of mu ch of Africa's dryland agricultural production was more severe than if an invading army had pursued a scorc hed-earth policy. Yet most of the affected governme nts still spend far more to protect their people from invadin g armies than from the invading desert. 23. Globally, military expenditures total about $1 trillion a year and continue to grow. In many count ries, military spending consumes such a high proportion of GNP tha t it itself does great damage to these societies' development efforts. Governments tend to base their approaches to 'security' on traditional definition s. This is most obvious in the attempts to achieve security th rough the development of potentially planet-destroy ing nuclear weapons systems. Studies suggest that the c old and dark nuclear winter following even a limite d nuclear war could destroy plant and animal ecosyste ms and leave any human survivors occupying a devastated planet very different from the one they inherited. 24. The arms race - in all parts of the world - pre -empts resources that might be used more productive ly to diminish the security threats created by environmen tal conflict and the resentments that are fuelled b y widespread poverty. 25. Many present efforts to guard and maintain huma n progress, to meet human needs, and to realize hum an ambitions are simply unsustainable - in both the ri ch and poor nations. They draw too heavily, too qui ckly, on already overdrawn environmental resource accounts t o be affordable far into the future without bankrup ting those accounts. They may show profit on the balance sheets of our generation, but our children will in herit the losses. We borrow environmental capital from future generations with no intention or prospect of repay ing. They may damn us for our spendthrift ways, but they can never collect on our debt to them. We act as w e do United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. because we can get away with it: future generations do not vote; they have no political or financial p ower; they cannot challenge our decisions. 26. But the results of the present profligacy are r apidly closing the options for future generations. Most of today's decision makers will be dead before the pla net feels; the heavier effects of acid precipitatio n, global warming, ozone depletion, or widespread desertifica tion and species loss. Most of the young voters of today will still be alive. In the Commission's hearings i t was the young, those who have the most to lose, w ho were the harshest critics of the planet's present manage ment. 3. Sustainable Development 27. Humanity has the ability to make development su stainable to ensure that it meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generati ons to meet their own needs. The concept of sustain able development does imply limits - not absolute limits but limitations imposed by the present state of te chnology and social organization on environmental resources and by the ability of the biosphere to absorb the e ffects of human activities. But technology and social organiz ation can be both managed and improved to make way for a new era of economic growth. The Commission believes that widespread poverty is no longer inevitable. P overty is not only an evil in itself, but sustainable deve lopment requires meeting the basic needs of all and extending to all the opportunity to fulfil their aspirations for a better life. A world in which poverty is ende mic will always be prone to ecological and other catastrophes. 28. Meeting essential needs requires not only a new era of economic growth for nations in which the ma jority are poor, but an assurance that those poor get thei r fair share of the resources required to sustain t hat growth. Such equity would be aided by political systems tha t secure effective citizen participation in decisio n making and by greater democracy in international decision making. 29. Sustainable global development requires that th ose who are more affluent adopt life-styles within the planet's ecological means - in their use of energy, for example. Further, rapidly growing populations can increase the pressure on resources and slow any ris e in living standards; thus sustainable development can only be pursued if population size and growth are i n harmony with the changing productive potential of the ecosystem. 30. Yet in the end, sustainable development is not a fixed state of harmony, but rather a process of c hange in which the exploitation of resources, the direction of investments, the orientation of technological de velopment, and institutional change are made consistent with f uture as well as present needs. We do not pretend t hat the process is easy or straightforward. Painful choices have to be made. Thus, in the final analysis, sust ainable development must rest on political will. 4. The Institutional Gaps 31. The objective of sustainable development and th e integrated nature of the global environment/devel opment challenges pose problems for institutions, national and international, that were established on the ba sis of narrow preoccupations and compartmentalized concern s. Governments' general response to the speed and scale of global changes has been a reluctance to re cognize sufficiently the need to change themselves. The challenges are both interdependent and integrated, requiring comprehensive approaches and popular participation. 32. Yet most of the institutions facing those chall enges tend to be independent, fragmented, working t o relatively narrow mandates with closed decision pro cesses. Those responsible for managing natural reso urces and protecting the environment are institutionally separated from those responsible for managing the e conomy. The real world of interlocked economic and ecologic al systems will not change; the policies and instit utions concerned must. 33. There is a growing need for effective internati onal cooperation to manage ecological and economic interdependence. Yet at the same time, confidence i n international organizations is diminishing and su pport for them dwindling. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 34. The other great institutional flaw in coping wi th environment/development challenges is government s' failure to make the bodies whose policy actions degrade the environment responsible for ensuring that their po licies prevent that degradation. Environmental concern aro se from damage caused by the rapid economic growth following the Second World War. Governments, pressu red by their citizens, saw a need to clean up the m ess, and they established environmental ministries and a gencies to do this. Many had great success within t he limits of their mandates - in improving air and water qual ity and enhancing other resources. But much of thei r work has of necessity been after-the-fact repair of dama ge: reforestation, reclaiming desert lands, rebuild ing urban environments, restoring natural habitats, and rehab ilitating wild lands. 35. The existence of such agencies gave many govern ments and their citizens the false impression that these bodies were by themselves able to protect and enhan ce the environmental resource base. Yet many industrialized and most developing countries carry huge economic burdens from inherited problems such an air and water pollution, depletion of groundwater, and the proliferation of toxic chemicals and hazardous wastes. These have been joined by more recent problems - er osion, desertification, acidification, new chemical s, and new forms of waste - that are directly related to a gricultural, industrial, energy, forestry, and tran sportation policies and practices. 36. The mandates of the central economic and sector al ministries are also often too narrow, too concer ned with quantities of production or growth. The mandates of ministries of industry include production targets, while the accompanying pollution is left to ministries of env ironment. Electricity boards produce power, while t he acid pollution they also produce is left to other bodies to clean up. The present challenge is to give the central economic and sectoral ministries the responsibility for the quality of those parts of the human enviro nment affected by their decisions, and to give the enviro nmental agencies more power to cope with the effect s of unsustainable development. 37. The same need for change holds for internationa l agencies concerned with development lending, trad e regulation, agricultural development, and so on. Th ese have been slow to take the environmental effect s of their work into account, although some are trying t o do so. 38. The ability to anticipate and prevent environme ntal damage requires that the ecological dimensions of policy be considered at the same time as the econom ic, trade, energy, agricultural, and other dimensio ns. They should be considered on the same agendas and in the same national and international institutions. 39. This reorientation is one of the chief institut ional challenges of the 1990s and beyond. Meeting i t will require major institutional development and reform. Many co untries that are too poor or small or that have lim ited managerial capacity will find it difficult to do th is unaided. They will need financial and technical assistance and training. But the changes required involve all coun tries, large and small, rich and poor. II. The Policy Directions 40. The Commission has focused its attention in the areas of population, food security, the loss of sp ecies and genetic resources, energy, industry, and human sett lements - realizing that all of these are connected and cannot be treated in isolation one from another. Th is section contains only a few of the Commission's many recommendations. 1. Population and Human Resources 41. In many parts of the world, the population is g rowing at rates that cannot be sustained by availab le environmental resources, at rates that are outstrip ping any reasonable expectations of improvements in housing, health care, food security, or energy supp lies. 42. The issue is not just numbers of people, but ho w those numbers relate to available resources. Thus the 'population problem' must be dealt with in part by efforts to eliminate mass poverty, in order to assu re more equitable access to resources, and by education to improve human potential to manage those resources. 43. Urgent steps are needed to limit extreme rates of population growth. Choices made now will influen ce the level at which the population stabilizes next centu ry within a range of 6 billion people. But this is not just a United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. demographic issue; providing people with facilities and education that allow them to choose the size o f their families is a way of assuring - especially for wome n - the basic human right of self-determination. 44. Governments that need to do so should develop l ong-term, multifaceted population policies and a ca mpaign to pursue broad demographic goals: to strengthen so cial, cultural, and economic motivations for family planning, and to provide to all who want them the e ducation, contraceptives, and services required. 45. Human resource development is a crucial require ment not only to build up technical knowledge and capabilities, but also to create new values to help individuals and nations cope with rapidly changing social, environmental, and development realities. Knowledge shared globally would assure greater mutual understanding and create greater willingness to sha re global resources equitably. 46. Tribal and indigenous peoples will need special attention as the forces of economic development di srupt their traditional life-styles - life-styles that ca n offer modern societies many lessons in the manage ment of resources in complex forest, mountain, and dryland ecosystems. Some are threatened with virtual extinc tion by insensitive development over which they have no con trol. Their traditional rights should be recognized and they should be given a decisive voice in formulating pol icies about resource development in their areas. (S ee Chapter 4 for a wider discussion of these issues and recomme ndations.) 2. Food Security: Sustaining the Potential 47. Growth in world cereal production has steadily outstripped world population growth. Yet each year there are more people in the world who do not get enough food . Global agriculture has the potential to grow enou gh food for all, but food is often not available where it i s needed. 48. Production in industrialized countries has usua lly been highly subsidized and protected from inter national competition. These subsidies have encouraged the ov eruse of soil and chemicals, the pollution of both water resources and foods with these chemicals, and the d egradation of the countryside. Much of this effort has produced surpluses and their associated financial b urdens. And some of this surplus has been sent at concessional rates to the developing world, where i t has undermined the farming policies of recipient nations. There is, however, growing awareness in some countr ies of the environmental and economic consequences of such paths, and the emphasis of agricultural polici es is to encourage conservation. 49. Many developing countries, on the other hand, h ave suffered the opposite problem: farmers are not sufficiently supported. In some, improved technolog y allied to price incentives and government service s has produced a major breakthrough in food production. B ut elsewhere, the food-growing small farmers have b een neglected. Coping with often inadequate technology and few economic incentives, many are pushed onto marginal land: too dry, too steep, lacking in nutri ents. Forests are cleared and productive drylands r endered barren. 50. Most developing nations need more effective inc entive systems to encourage production, especially of food crops. In short, the 'terms of trade' need to be tu rned in favour of the small farmer. Most industrial ized nations, on the other hand, must alter present systems in or der to cut surpluses, to reduce unfair competition with nations that may have real comparative advantages, and to promote ecologically sound farming practices . 51. Food security requires attention to questions o f distribution, since hunger often arises from lack of purchasing power rather than lack of available food . It can be furthered by land reforms, and by polic ies to protect vulnerable subsistence farmers, pastora1ist s, and the landless - groups who by the year 2000 w ill include 220 million households. Their greater prosp erity will depend on integrated rural development t hat increases work opportunities both inside and outsid e agriculture. (See Chapter 5 for a wider discussion of these issues and recommendations.) 3. Species and Ecosystems: Resources for Developmen t United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 52. The planet's species are under stress. There is a growing scientific consensus that species are disappearing at rates never before witnessed on the planet, although there is also controversy over th ose rates and the risks they entail. Yet there is still time to halt this process. 53. The diversity of species is necessary for the n ormal functioning of ecosystems and the biosphere a s a whole. The genetic material in wild species contrib utes billions of dollars yearly to the world econom y in the form of improved crop species, new drugs and medici nes, and raw materials for industry. But utility as ide, there are also moral, ethical, cultural, aesthetic, and p urely scientific reasons for conserving wild beings . 54. A first priority is to establish the problem of disappearing species and threatened ecosystems on political agendas as a major economic and resource issue. 55. Governments can stem the destruction of tropica l forests and other reservoirs of biological divers ity while developing them economically. Reforming forest reve nue systems and concession terms could raise billio ns of dollars of additional revenues, promote more effici ent, long-term forest resource use, and curtail def orestation. 56. The network of protected areas that the world w ill need in the future must include much larger are as brought under so.ne degree of protection. Therefore , the cost of conservation will rise - directly and in terms of opportunities for development foregone. But over th e long term the opportunities for development will be enhanced. International development agencies should therefore give comprehensive and systematic attent ion to the problems and opportunities of species conser vation. 57. Governments should investigate the prospect of agreeing to a 'Species Convention', similar in spir it and scope to other international conventions reflecting principles of 'universal resources'. They should a lso consider international financial arrangements to support the implementation of such a convention. (See Chapter 6 for a wider discussion of these issues and recommendation s.) 4. Energy: Choices for Environment and Development 58. A safe and sustainable energy pathway is crucia l to sustainable development; we have not yet found it. Rates of increase in energy use have been declining . However, the industrialization, agricultural deve lopment, and rapidly growing populations of developing natio ns will need much more energy. Today, the average p erson in an industrial market economy uses more than 80 t imes as much energy as someone in sub-Saharan Afric a. Thus any realistic global energy scenario must prov ide for substantially increased primary energy use by developing countries. 59. To bring developing countries' energy use up to industrialized country levels by the year 2025 wou ld require increasing present global energy use by a factor of five. The planetary ecosystem could not stand this , especially if the increases were based on non-renew able fossil fuels. Threats of global warming and acidification of the environment most probably rule out even a doubling of energy use bared on present mixes of primary sources. 60. Any new era of economic growth must therefore b e less energy intensive than growth in the past. En ergy efficiency policies must be the cutting edge of nat ional energy strategies for sustainable development , and there is much scope for improvement in this directi on. Modern appliances can be redesigned to deliver the same amounts of energy-services with only two-third s or even one-half of the primary energy inputs nee ded to run traditional equipment. And energy efficiency so lutions are often cost-effective. 61. After almost four decades of immense technologi cal effort, nuclear energy has become widely used. During this period, however, the nature of its costs, risk s, and benefits have become more evident and the su bject of sharp controversy. Different countries world-wide t ake up different positions on the use of nuclear en ergy. The discussion in the Commission also reflected these d ifferent views and positions. Yet all agreed that t he generation of nuclear power is only justifiable if there are solid solutions to the unsolved problems to which it gives rise. The highest priority should be accorded to research and development on environmentally sou nd and ecologically viable alternatives, as well as on mea ns of increasing the safety of nuclear energy. 62. Energy efficiency can only buy time for the wor ld to develop 'low-energy paths' based on renewable sources, which should form the foundation of the gl obal energy structure during the 21st Century. Most of these United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. sources are currently problematic, but given innova tive development, they could supply the same amount of primary energy the planet now consumes. However, ac hieving these use levels will require a programme o f coordinated research, development, and demonstratio n projects commanding funding necessary to ensure t he rapid development of renewable energy. Developing c ountries will require assistance to change their en ergy use patterns in this direction. 63. Millions of people in the developing world are short of fuelwood, the main domestic energy of half of humanity, and their numbers are growing. The wood-p oor nations must organize their agricultural sector s to produce large amounts of wood and other plant fuels . 64. The substantial changes required in the present global energy mix will not be achieved by market p ressures alone, given the dominant role of governments as pr oducers of energy and their importance as consumers . If the recent momentum behind annual gains in energy e fficiency is to be maintained and extended,governme nts need to make it an explicit goal of their policies for energy pricing to consumers, prices needed to e ncourage the adoption of energy-saving measures may be achie ved through several means. Although the Commission expresses no preference, 'conservation pricing' req uires that governments take a long-term view in wei ghing the costs and benefits of the various measures. Giv en the importance of oil prices on international en ergy policy, new mechanisms for encouraging dialogue bet ween consumers and producers should be explored. 65. A safe, environmentally sound, and economically viable energy pathway that will sustain human prog ress into the distant future is clearly imperative. It i s also possible. But it will require new dimensions of political will and institutional cooperation to achieve it. (See Chapter 7 for a wider discussion of these issues and recommendations.) 5. Industry: Producing More with Less 66. The world manufactures seven times more goods t oday than it did as recently as 1950. Given populat ion growth rates, a five- to tenfold increase in manufa cturing output will be needed just to raise develop ing world consumption of manufactured goods to industrialized world levels by the time population growth rates l evel off next century. 67. Experience in the industrialized nations has pr oved that anti-pollution technology has been cost-e ffective in terms of health, property, and environmental damage avoided, and that it has made many industries more profitable by waking them more resource-efficient. While economic growth has continued, the consumptio n of raw materials has held steady or even declined, and new technologies offer further efficiencies. 68. Nations have to bear the costs of any inappropr iate industrialization, and many developing countri es are realizing that they have neither the resources nor - given rapid technological change - the time to da mage their environments now and clean up later. But they also need assistance and information from industrialized nations to make the best use of technology. Transnational c orporations have a special responsibility to smooth the path of industrialization in the nations in which they o perate. 69. Emerging technologies offer the promise of high er productivity, increased efficiency, and decrease d pollution, but many bring risks of new toxic chemic als and wastes and of major accidents of a type and scale beyond present coping mechanisms. There is an urgen t need for tighter controls over the export of haza rdous industrial and agricultural chemicals. Present cont rols over the dumping of hazardous wastes should be tightened. 70. Many essential human needs can be net only thro ugh goods and services provided by industry, and th e shift to sustainable development must be powered by a continuing flow of wealth from industry. (See Chapter 8 for a wider discussion of these issues and recommen dations.) 6. The Urban Challenge 71. By the turn of the century, almost half of huma nity will live in cities; the world of the 21st cen tury will be a largely urban world. Over only 65 years, the develo ping world's urban population has increased tenfold , from around 100 million in 1920 to 1 billion today. In 1 940, one person in 100 lived in a city of 1 million or more inhabitants; by 1980, one in 10 lived in such a cit y. Between 1985 and the year 2000, Third World citi es could United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. grow by another three-quarters of a billion people. This suggests that the developing world must, over the next few years, increase by 65 per cent its capacity to produce and manage its urban infrastructure, servic es, and shelter merely to maintain today's often extremely inadequate conditions. 72. Few city governments in the developing world ha ve the power, resources, and trained personnel to p rovide their rapidly growing populations with the land, se rvices, and facilities needed for an adequate human life: clean water, sanitation, schools, and transport. The resu lt is mushrooming illegal settlements with primitiv e facilities, increased overcrowding, and rampant disease linked to an unhealthy environment. Many cities in industr ial countries also face problems - deteriorating infras tructure, environmental degradation, inner-city dec ay, and neighbourhood collapse. But with the means and reso urces to tackle this decline, the issue for most in dustrial countries is ultimately one of political and social choice. Developing countries are not in the same s ituation. They have a major urban crisis on their hands. 73. Governments will need to develop explicit settl ements strategies to guide the process of urbanizat ion, taking the pressure off the largest urban centres a nd building up smaller towns and cities, more close ly integrating them with their rural hinterlands. This will mean examining and changing other policies - taxation, food pricing, transportation, health, industrializa tion - that work against the goals of settlements s trategies. 74. Good city management requires decentralization of funds, political power, and personnel - to local authorities, which are best placed to appreciate an d manage local needs. But the sustainable developme nt of cities will depend on closer work with the majoriti es of urban poor who are the true city builders, ta pping the skills, energies and resources of neighbourhood gro ups and those in the 'informal sector'. Much can be achieved by 'site and service' schemes that provide households with basic services and help them to ge t on with building sounder houses around these. (See Chapter 9 for a wider discussion of these issues and recommendations.) III. International Cooperation and Institutional Re form 1. The Role of the International Economy 75. Two conditions must be satisfied before interna tional economic exchanges can become beneficial for all involved. The sustainability of ecosystems on which the global economy depends must be guaranteed. And the economic partners must be satisfied that the basis of exchange is equitable. For many developing count ries, neither condition is set. 76. Growth in many developing countries is being st ifled by depressed commodity prices, protectionism, intolerable debt burdens, and declining flows of de velopment finance. If living standards are to grow so as to alleviate poverty, these trends must be reversed. 77. A particular responsibility falls to the World Bank and the International Development Association as the main conduit for multilateral finance to developing countries. In the context of consistently increase d financial flows, the World Bank can support environmentally s ound projects and policies. In financing structural adjustment, the International Monetary Fund should support wider and longer term development objective s than at present: growth, social goals, and environm ental impacts. 78. The present level of debt service of many count ries, especially in Africa and Latin America, is no t consistent with sustainable development. Debtors are being req uired to use trade surpluses to service debts, and are drawing heavily on non-renewable resources to do so . Urgent action is necessary to alleviate debt burd ens in ways that represent a fairer sharing between both d ebtors and lenders of the responsibilities and burd ens. 79. Current arrangements for commodities could be s ignificantly improved: more compensatory financing to offset economic shocks would encourage producers to take a long-term view, and not to overproduce commodities; and more assistance could be given fro m diversification programmes. Commodity-specific arrangements can build on the model of the Internat ional Tropical Timber Agreement, one of the few tha t specifically includes ecological concerns 80. Multinational companies can play an important r ole in sustainable development, especially as devel oping countries come to rely more on foreign equity capit al. But if these companies are to have a positive i nfluence on United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. development, the negotiating capacity of developing countries vis a vis transnationals must be strengt hened so they can secure terms which respect their environme ntal concerns. 81. However, these specific measures must be locate d in a wider context of effective cooperation to pr oduce an international economic system geared to growth and the elimination of world poverty. (See Chapter 3 for a more detailed discussion of issues and recommendati ons on the international economy.) 2. Managing the Commons 82. Traditional forms of national sovereignty raise particular problems in managing the 'global common s' and their shared ecosystems - the oceans, outer space, and Antarctica. Some progress has been made in all three areas; much remains to be done. 83. The UN Conference on the Law of the Sea was the most ambitious attempt ever to provide an internationally agreed regime for the management of the oceans. All nations should ratify the Law of t he Sea Treaty as soon at possible. Fisheries agreements sh ould be strengthened to prevent current overexploit ation, as should conventions to control and regulate the d umping of hazardous wastes at sea. 84. There are growing concerns about the management of orbital space, centering on using satellite tec hnology for monitoring planetary systems; on making the mos t effective use of the limited capacities of geosyn chronous orbit for communications satellites; and on limitin g space debris. The orbiting and testing of weapons in space would greatly increase this debris. The internation al community should seek to design and implement a space regime to ensure that space remains a peaceful envi ronment for the benefit of all. 85. Antarctica is managed under the 1959 Antarctica Treaty. However, many nations outside of that pact view the Treaty System as too limited, both in participa tion and in the scope of its conservation measures. The Commission's recommendations deal with the safeguar ding of present achievements; the incorporation of any minerals development into a management regime; and various options for the future. (See Chapter 10 for more discussion in issues and recommendations on the man agement of the commons.) 3. Peace, Security, Development, and the Environmen t 86. Among the dangers facing the environment, the p ossibility of nuclear war is undoubtedly the graves t. Certain aspects of the issues of peace and security bear directly upon the concept of sustainable deve lopment. The whole notion of security as traditionally under stood in terms of political and military threats to national sovereignty - must be expanded to include the growi ng impacts of environmental stress - locally, natio nally, regionally, and globally. There are no military sol utions to 'environmental insecurity'. 87. Governments and international agencies should a ssess the cost-effectiveness, in terms of achieving security, of money spent on armaments compared with money spent on reducing poverty or restoring a ravaged environment. 88. But the greatest need is to achieve improved re lations among those major powers capable of deployi ng weapons of mass destruction. This is needed to achi eve agreement on tighter control over the prolifera tion and testing of various types of weapons of mass destruc tion - nuclear and non nuclear - including those th at have environmental implications. (See Chapter 11 for more discussion of issues and recommendations on the links between peace, security, development, and the envir onment.) 4. Institutional and Legal Change 89. The Report that follows contains throughout (an d especially in Chapter 12 ), many specific recommendations for institutional and legal change. These cannot be adequately summarized here. Howeve r, the Commission's main proposals are embodied in six priority areas. 4.1 Getting at the Sources United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 90. Governments must begin now to make the key nati onal, economic, and sectoral agencies directly responsible and accountable for ensuring that their policies, programmes, and budgets support developm ent that is economically and ecologically sustainable. 91. By the same token, the various regional organiz ations need to do more to integrate environment ful ly in their goals and activities. New regional arrangemen ts will especially be needed among developing count ries to deal with transboundary environmental issues. 92. All major international bodies and agencies sho uld ensure that their programmes encourage and supp ort sustainable development, and they should greatly im prove their coordination and cooperation. The Secre tary- General of the United Nations Organization should p rovide a high level centre of leadership for the UN system to assess, advise, assist, and report on progress m ade towards this goal. 4.2 Dealing with the Effects 93. Governments should also reinforce the roles and capacities of environmental protection and resourc e management agencies. This is needed in many industr ialized countries, but most urgently in developing countries, which will need assistance in strengthen ing their institutions. The UN Environment Programm e (UNEP) should be strengthened as the principal sour ce on environmental data, assessment, and reporting and as the principal advocate and agent for change and international cooperation on critical environment a nd natural resource protection issues. 4.3 Assessing Global Risks 94. The capacity to identify, assess, and report on risks of irreversible damage to natural systems an d threats to the survival, security, and well being of the wo rld community must be rapidly reinforced and extend ed. Governments, individually and collectively, have th e principal responsibility to do this. UNEP's Earth watch programme should be the centre of leadership in the UN system on risk assessment 95. However, given the politically sensitive nature of many of the most critical risks, there is also a need for an independent but complementary capacity to assess an d report on critical global risks. A new internatio nal programme for cooperation among largely non-governm ental organizations, scientific bodies, and industr y groups should therefore be established for this pur pose. 4.4 Making Informed Choices 96. Making the difficult choices involved in achiev ing sustainable development will depend on the wide spread support and involvement of an informed public and o f NGOs, the scientific community, and industry. The ir rights, roles and participation in development plan ning, decision-making, and project implementation s hould be expanded. 4.5 Providing the Legal Means 97. National and international law is being rapidly outdistanced by the accelerating pace and expandin g scale of impacts on the ecological basis of development. Governments now need to fill major gaps in existing national and international law related to the environment, t o find ways to recognize and protect the rights of present and future generations to an environment adequate for t heir health and well-being, to prepare under UN aus pices a universal Declaration on environmental protection a nd sustainable development and a subsequent Convent ion, and to strengthen procedures for avoiding or resolv ing disputes on environment and resource management issues. 4.6 Investing in our Future 98. Over the past decade, the overall cost-effectiv eness of investments in halting pollution has been demonstrated. The escalating economic and ecologica l damage costs of not investing in environmental protection and improvement have also been repeatedl y demonstrated - often in grim tolls of flood and f amine. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. But there are large financial implications: for ren ewable energy development, pollution control, and a chieving less resource intensive forms of agriculture. 99. Multilateral financial institutions have a cruc ial role to play. The World Bank is presently reori enting its programmes towards greater environmental concerns. This should be accompanied by a fundamental commitment to sustainable development by the Bank. It is also essential that the Regional Development Banks and the International Monetary Fund incorporate sim ilar objectives in their policies and programmes. A new priority and focus is also needed in bilateral aid agencies. 100. Given the limitations on increasing present fl ows of international aid, proposals for securing ad ditional revenue from the use of international commons and n atural resources should now be seriously considered by governments. IV. A Call for Action 101. Over the course of this century, the relations hip between the human world and the planet that sus tains it has undergone a profound change. 102. When the century began, neither human numbers nor technology had the power radically to alter planetary systems. As the century closes, not only do vastly increased human numbers and their activit ies have that power, but major, unintended changes are occur ring in the atmosphere, in soils, in waters, among plants and animals, and in the relationships among all of these. The rate of change is outstripping the abili ty of scientific disciplines and our current capabilities to assess and advise. It is frustrating the attemp ts of political and economic institutions, which evolved in a diffe rent, more fragmented world, to adapt and cope. It deeply worries many people who are seeking ways to place t hose concerns on the political agendas. 103. The onus lies with no one group of nations. De veloping countries face the obvious life-threatenin g challenges of desertification, deforestation, and p ollution, and endure most of the poverty associated with environmental degradation. The entire human family of nations would suffer from the disappearance of r ain forests in the tropics, the loss of plant and anima l species, and changes in rainfall patterns. Indust rial nations face the life-threatening challenges of toxic chemi cals, toxic wastes, and acidification. All nations may suffer from the releases by industrialized countries of ca rbon dioxide and of gases that react with the ozone layer, and from any future war fought with the nuclear arsenal s controlled by those nations. All nations will hav e a role to play in changing trends, and in righting an interna tional economic system that increases rather than d ecreases inequality, that increases rather than decreases nu mbers of poor and hungry. 104. The next few decades are crucial. The time has come to break out of past patterns. Attempts to ma intain social and ecological stability through old approac hes to development and environmental protection wil l increase instability. Security must be sought throu gh change. The Commission has noted a number of act ions that must be taken to reduce risks to survival and to put future development on paths that are sustain able. Yet we are aware that such a reorientation on a continu ing basis is simply beyond the reach of present dec ision- making structures and institutional arrangements, b oth national and international. 105. This Commission has been careful to base our r ecommendations on the realities of present institut ions, on what can and must be accomplished today. But to kee p options open for future generations, the present generation must begin now, and begin together. 106. To achieve the needed changes, we believe that an active follow-up of this report is imperative. It is with this in mind that we call for the UN General Assemb ly, upon due consideration, to transform this repor t into a UN Programme on Sustainable Development. Special fo llow-up conferences could be initiated at the regio nal level. Within an appropriate period after the prese ntation of this report to the General Assembly, an international conference could be convened to revie w progress made, and to promote follow up arrangeme nts that will be needed to set benchmarks and to mainta in human progress. 107. First and foremost, this Commission has been c oncerned with people - of all countries and all wal ks of life. And it is to people that we address our report. The changes in human attitudes that we call for depend on a vast campaign of education, debate, and public part icipation. This campaign must start now if sustaina ble human progress is to be achieved.

The Members of the World Commission on Environ ment and Development came from 21 very different nations. In our discussions, we disagreed often on details and priorities. But despite our widely diff ering backgrounds and varying national and international responsibilities, we were able to agree to the line s along which change must be drawn. 109. We are unanimous in our conviction that the se curity, well-being, and very survival of the planet depend on such changes, now.

New Approaches to Environment and Development United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 1. The Earth is one but the world is not. We all de pend on one biosphere for sustaining our lives. Yet each community, each country, strives for survival and p rosperity with little regard for its impact on othe rs. Some consume the Earth's resources at a rate that would leave little for future generations. Others, many m ore in number, consume far too little and live with the pr ospect of hunger, squalor, disease, and early death . 2. Yet progress has been made. Throughout much of t he world, children born today can expect to live lo nger and be better educated than their parents. In many parts, the new-born can also expect to attain a hig her standard of living in a wider sense. Such progress provides hope as we contemplate the improvements st ill needed, and also as we face our failures to make th is Earth a safer and sounder home for us and for th ose who are to come. 3. The failures that we need to correct arise both from poverty and from the short-sighted way in whic h we have often pursued prosperity. Many parts of the world a re caught in a vicious downwards spiral: Poor peopl e are forced to overuse environmental resources to surviv e from day to day, and their impoverishment of thei r environment further impoverishes them, making their survival ever more difficult and uncertain. The pr osperity attained in some parts of the world is often precar ious, as it has been secured through farming, fores try, and industrial practices that bring profit and progress only over the short term. 4. Societies have faced such pressures in the past and, as many desolate ruins remind us, sometimes succumbed to them. But generally these pressures we re local. Today the scale of ow interventions in na ture is increasing and the physical effects of our decision s spill across national frontiers. The growth in ec onomic interaction between nations amplifies the wider con sequences of national decisions. Economics and ecol ogy bind us in ever-tightening networks. Today, many re gions face risks of irreversible damage to the huma n environment that threaten the basis for human progr ess. 5. These deepening interconnections are the central justification for the establishment of this Commis sion. We travelled the world for nearly three years, listeni ng. At special public hearings organized by the Com mission, we heard from government leaders, scientists, and expe rts, from citizens' groups concerned about a wide r ange of environment and development issues, and from thousa nds of individuals farmers, shanty-town residents, young people, industrialists, and indigenous and tribal p eoples. 6. We found everywhere deep public concern for the environment, concern that has led not just to prote sts but often to changed behaviour. The challenge is to ens ure that these new values are more adequately refle cted in the principles and operations of political and econ omic structures. 7. We also found grounds for hope: that people can cooperate to build a future that is more prosperous , more just, and more secure; that a new era of economic g rowth can be attained, one based on policies that s ustain and expand the Earth's resource base; and that the progress that some have known over the last century can be experienced by all in the years ahead. But for t his to happen, we must understand better the sympto ms of stress that confront us, we must identify the cause s, and we must design new approaches to managing environmental resources and to sustaining human dev elopment I. Symptoms and Causes 8. Environmental stress has often been seen as the result of the growing demand on scarce resources an d the pollution generated by the rising living standards of the relatively affluent. But poverty itself poll utes the environment, creating environmental stress in a dif ferent way. Those who are poor and hungry will ofte n destroy their immediate environment in order to sur vive: They will cut down forests; their livestock w ill overgraze grasslands; they will overuse marginal la nd; and in growing numbers they will crowd into con gested cities. The cumulative effect of these changes is s o far-reaching as to make poverty itself a major gl obal scourge. 9. On the other hand, where economic growth has led to improvements in living standards, it has someti mes been achieved in ways that are globally damaging in the longer term. Much of the improvement in the pa st has been based on the use of increasing amounts of raw materials, energy, chemicals, and synthetics and on the creation of pollution that is not adequately accoun ted for in figuring the costs of production process es. These United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. trends have had unforeseen effects on the environme nt. Thus today's environmental challenges arise bot h from the lack of development and from the unintended con sequences of some forms of economic growth. 1. Poverty 10. There are more hungry people in the world today than ever before in human history, and their numbe rs are growing. In 1980, there were 340 million people in 87 developing countries not getting enough calories to prevent stunted growth and serious health risks. Th is total was very slightly below the figure for 197 0 in terms of share of the world population, but in terms of s heer numbers, it represented a 14 per cent increase . The World Bank predicts that these numbers are likely t o go on growing. /1 I think this Commission should give attention on ho w to look into the question of more participation f or those people who are the object of development. Their bas ic needs include the right to preserve their cultur al identity, and their right not to be alienated from their own society, and their own community. So the point I wa nt to make is that we cannot discuss environment or developmen t without discussing political development. And you cannot eradicate poverty, at least not only by redi stributing wealth or income, but there must be more redistribution of power. Aristides Katoppo Publisher WCED Public Hearing Jakarta, 26 March 1985 11. The number of people living in slums and shanty towns is rising, not falling. A growing number lac k access to clean water and sanitation and hence are prey to the diseases that arise from this lack. There is s ome progress, impressive in places. But, on balance, po verty persists and its victims multiply. 12. The pressure of poverty has to be seen in a bro ader context. At the international level there are large differences in per capita income, which ranged in 1 984 from $190 in low income countries (other than C hina and India) to $11,430 in the industrial market econ omies. (See Table 1-1) Table 1-1 Population Size and per capita GDP by Groups of Cou ntries Population Per capita GDP Average annual growth rate of per capita GDP, 1965-1984 (millions) (1984 dollars) (per cent) Countries Low-income countries (excluding China, India) 611 190 0.9 China and India 1,778 390 3.2 Lower Middle-income Economies 691 740 1.0 Upper Middle-income Economies 497 1,980 3.1 High-Income Oil Exporters 19 11,350 3.2 Industrial Market Economies 732 11,430 2.4 Source: Based on data in World Bank, World Developm ent Report, 1985. (New York, Oxford University Pres s, 1986) 13. Such inequalities represent great differences n ot merely in the quality of life today, but also in the capacity of societies to improve their quality of life in th e future. Most of the world's poorest countries dep end for increasing export earnings on tropical agricultural products that are vulnerable to fluctuating or dec lining terms of trade. Expansion can often only be achieved at t he price of ecological stress. Yet diversification in ways that will alleviate both poverty and ecological stress i s hampered by disadvantageous terms of technology t ransfer, by protectionism, and by declining financial flows to those countries that most need international fin ance. /2 United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 14. Within countries, poverty has been exacerbated by the unequal distribution of land and other asset s. The rapid rise in population has compromised the abilit y to raise living standards. These factors, combine d with growing demands for the commercial use of good land , often to grow crops for exports, have pushed many subsistence farmers onto poor land and robbed them of any hope of participating in their nations' econ omic lives. The same forces have meant that traditional shifting cultivators, who once cut forests, grew cr ops, and then gave the forest time to recover, now have neit her land enough nor time to let forests re-establis h. So forests are being destroyed, often only to create p oor farmland that cannot support those who till it. Extending cultivation onto steep slopes is increasing soil er osion in many hilly sections of both developing and developed nations. In any river valleys, areas chronically li able to floods are now farmed. 15. These pressures are reflected in the rising inc idence of disasters. During the 1970s, six times as many people died from 'natural disasters' each year as i n the 1960s, and twice as many suffered from such d isasters. Droughts and floods, disasters among whose causes a re widespread deforestation and overcultivation, increased most in terms of numbers affected. There were 18.5 million people affected by droughts annua lly in the 1960s, but 24.4 billion in the 1970s; 5.2 billi on people were victims of floods yearly in the 1960 s, compared with 15.4 million in the 1970s. /3 The results are not in for the 1980s, but this dis aster-prone decade seems to be carrying forward the trend, with droughts in Afr ica, India, and Latin America, and floods throughou t Asia, parts of Africa, and the Andean region of Latin Ame rica. 16. Such disasters claim most of their victims amon g the impoverished in poor nations, where subsisten ce farmers must make their land more liable to drought s and floods by clearing marginal areas, and where the poor make themselves tore vulnerable to all disaste rs by living on steep slopes and unprotected shores - the only lands left for their shanties. Lacking food an d foreign exchange reserves their economically vuln erable governments are ill-equipped to cope with such cata strophes. 17. The links between environmental stress and deve lopmental disaster are most evident in sub-Saharan Africa. Per capita food production, declining since the 1960s, plummeted during the drought of the 198 0s, and at the height of the food emergency some 35 million people were exposed to risk. Human overuse of land and prolonged drought threaten to turn the grasslands o f Africa's Sahel region into desert. /4 No other region more tragically suffers the vicious cycle of poverty lea ding to environmental degradation, which leads in t urn to even greater poverty. If people destroy vegetation in order to get land, food, fodder, fuel, or timber, the soil is no longe r protected. Rain creates surface runoff, and the soil erodes. W hen the soil is gone, no water is retained and the land can no longer produce enough food, fodder, fuel, or tim ber, so people need to turn to new land and start t he process all over again. All major disaster problems in the Third World are essentially unsolved development problems. Disaster prevention is thus primarily an aspect of developme nt, and this must be a development that takes place within the sustainable limits. Odd Grann Secretary General, Norwegian Red Cross WCED Public Hearing Oslo, 24-25 June 1985 2. Growth 18. In some parts of the world, particularly since the mid-1950s, growth and development have vastly i mproved living standards and the quality of life. Many of t he products and technologies that have gone into th is improvement are raw material- and energy-intensive and entail a substantial amount of pollution. The consequent impact on the environment is greater tha n ever before in human history. 19. Over the past century, the use of fossil fuels has grown nearly thirtyfold, and industrial product ion has increased move than fiftyfold. The bulk of this inc rease, about three-quarters in the case of fossil f uels and a little over four-fifths in the case of industrial p roduction, has taken place since 1950. The annual i ncrease in industrial production today is perhaps as large as the total production in Europe around the end of th e 1930s. /5 United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. Into every year we now squeeze the decades of indus trial growth and environmental disruption that form ed the basis of the pre-war European economy. 20. Environmental stresses also arise from more tra ditional forms of production. More land has been cl eared for settled cultivation in the past 100 years than in a ll the previous centuries of human existence. Inter ventions in the water cycles have increased greatly. Massive da ms, most of them built after 1960, impound a large proportion of the river flow. In Europe and Asia, w ater use has reached 10 per cent of the annual run off, a figure that is expected to rise to 20-25 per cent b y the end of the century. /6 21. The impact of growth and rising income levels c an be seen in the distribution of world consumption of a variety of resource intensive produce. The more aff luent industrialized countries use most of the worl d's metals and fossil fuels. Even in the case of food products a sharp difference exists, particularly in the pro ducts that are more resource-intensive. (See Table 1-2.) Table 1-2 Distribution of World Consumption, Averages for 198 0-83 Developed Countries (26% of population) Developing Countries (74% of population) Units of Per Capita Consumption Share in World Consumption Share in World Consumption Commodity per cent per capita per cent per capita Food Calories kcal/day 34 3,395 66 2,389 Protein gms/day 38 99 62 Fat gms/day 53 127 47 40 Paper kg/year 85 123 15 8 Steel kg/year 79 459 21 41 Other Metals kg/year 86 26 14 2 Commercial Energy /year 80 20 0.5 Source : WCED estimates based on country-level data from F AO, UN Statistical Office, UNCTAD and American Metals Association 22. In recent years, industrial countries have been able to achieve economic growth using less energy and raw materials per unit of output. This, along with the efforts to reduce the emission of pollutants, will help to contain the pressure on the biosphere. But with the increas e in population and the rise in incomes, per capita consumption of energy and materials will go up in t he developing countries, as it has to if essential needs are to be met. Greater attention to resource efficiency ca n moderate the increase, but, on balance, environme ntal problems linked to resource use will intensify in g lobal terms. 3. Survival 23. The scale and complexity of our requirements fo r natural resources have increased greatly with the rising levels of population and production. Nature is boun tiful, but it is also fragile and finely balanced. There are thresholds that cannot be crossed without endangeri ng the basic integrity of the system. Today we are close to many of these thresholds; we must be ever mindful o f the risk of endangering the survival of life on E arth. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. Moreover, the speed with which changes in resource use are taking place gives little time in which to anticipate and prevent unexpected effects. 24. The 'greenhouse effect', one such threat to lif e support systems, springs directly from increased resource use. The burning of fossil fuels and the cutting an d burning of forests release carbon dioxide (CO2). The accumulation in the atmosphere of CO2 and certain o ther gases traps solar radiation near the Earth's s urface, causing global warming. This could cause sea level rises over the next 45 years large enough to inunda te many low lying coastal cities and river deltas. It could also drastically upset national and internati onal agricultural production and trade systems. /7 The remarkable achievements of the celebrated Indus trial Revolution are now beginning seriously to be questioned principally because the environment was not considered at the time. It was felt that the sk y was so vast and clear nothing could ever change its colour , our rivers so big and their water so plentiful th at no amount of human activity could ever change their quality, and there were trees and natural forests so plentif ul that we will never finish them. After all, they grow again. Today we should know better. The alarming rate at w hich the Earth's surface is being denuded of its na tural vegetative cover seems to indicate that the world m ay soon become devoid of trees through clearing for human developments. Hon. Victoria Chitepo Minister of Natural Resources and Tourism, Governme nt of Zimbabwe WCED Opening Ceremony Harare, 18 Sept 1986 25. Another threat arises from the depletion of the atmospheric ozone layer by gases released during t he production of foam and the use of refrigerants and aerosols. A substantial loss of such ozone could ha ve catastrophic effects on human and livestock health and on some life forms at the base of the marine fo od chain. The 1986 discovery of a hole in the ozone layer abo ve the Antarctic suggests the possibility of a more rapid depletion than previously suspected. /8 26. A variety of air pollutants are killing trees a nd lakes and damaging buildings and cultural treasu res, close to and sometimes thousands of miles from points of emi ssion. The acidification of the environment threate ns large areas of Europe and North America. Central Europe i s currently receiving more than one gramme of sulph ur on every square metre of ground each year. /9 The loss of forests could bring in its wake disast rous erosion, siltation, floods, and local climatic change. Air p ollution damage is also becoming evident in some ne wly industrialized countries. 27. In many cases the practices used at present to dispose of toxic wastes, such as those from the che mical industries, involve unacceptable risks. Radioactive wastes from the nuclear industry remain hazardous for centuries. Many who bear these risks do not benefit in any way from the activities that produce the wa stes. 28. Desertification - the process whereby productiv e arid and semi-arid land is rendered economically unproductive - and large-scale deforestation are ot her examples of major threats to the integrity of r egional ecosystems. Desertification involves complex intera ctions between humans, land, and climate. The press ures of subsistence food production, commercial crops, a nd meat production in arid and semi-arid areas all contribute to this process. 29. Each year another 6 million hectares are degrad ed to desert-like conditions. /10 Over three decades, this would amount to an area roughly as large as Saudi A rabia. More than 11 million hectares of tropical fo rests are destroyed per year and this, over 30 years, would a mount to an area about the size of India. /11 Apart from the direct and often dramatic impacts within the immedi ate area, nearby regions are affected by the spread ing of sands or by changes in water regimes and increased risks of soil erosion and siltation. 30. The loss of forests and other wild lands exting uishes species of plants and animals and drasticall y reduces the genetic diversity of the world's ecosystems. Th is process robs present and future generations of g enetic material with which to improve crop varieties, to m ake them less vulnerable to weather stress, pest at tacks, and disease. The loss of species and subspecies, many a s yet unstudied by science, deprives us of importan t United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. potential sources of medicines and industrial chemi cals. It removes forever creatures of beauty and pa rts of our cultural heritage; it diminishes the biosphere. 31. Many of the risks stemming from our productive activity and the technologies we use cross-national boundaries; many are global. Though the activities that give rise to these dangers tend to be concentr ated in a few countries, the risks are shared by all, rich an d poor, those who benefit from them and those who d o not. Most who share in the risks have little influence o n the decision processes that regulate these activi ties. 32. Little time is available for corrective action. In some cases we may already be close to transgres sing critical thresholds. While scientists continue to research a nd debate causes and effects, in many cases we alre ady know enough to warrant action. This is true locally and regionally in the cases of such threats as des ertification, deforestation, toxic wastes, and acidification; it is true globally for such threats as climate change , ozone depletion, and species loss. The risks increase fas ter than do our abilities to manage them. 33. Perhaps the greatest threat to the Earth's envi ronment, to sustainable human progress, and indeed to survival is the possibility of nuclear war, increas ed daily by the continuing arms race and its spread to outer space. The search for a more viable future can only be meaningful in the context of a more vigorous ef fort to renounce and eliminate the development of means of annihilation. 4. The Economic Crisis 34. The environmental difficulties that confront us are not new, but only recently have we begun to un derstand their complexity. Previously our main concerns cent red on the effects of development on the environmen t. Today, we need to be equally concerned about the wa ys in which environmental degradation can dampen or reverse economic development. In one area after ano ther, environmental degradation is eroding the pote ntial for development. This basic connection was brought into sharp focus by the environment and development crises of the 1980s. 35. The slowdown in the momentum of economic expans ion and the stagnation in world trade in the 1980s challenged all nations' abilities to react and adju st. Developing countries that rely on the export of primary products have been hit particularly hard by falling commodity prices. Between 1980 and 1984, developin g countries lost about $55 billion in export earnings because of the fall in commodity prices, a blow fe lt most keenly in Latin America and Africa. /12 36. As a consequence of this period of slow growth in the world economy - together with rising debt se rvice obligations and a decline in the inflow of finance - many developing countries have facet) severe econ omic crises. Over half of all developing countries actua lly experienced declining per capita GDP in the yea rs 1982-85 and per capita GDP has fallen, for developing count ries as a whole, by around 10 per cent in the 1980s . (See Table 1-3.) Table 1-3 Annual Rate of Increase of Gross Domestic Product i n Developing Countries, 1976-85 Indicator 1976-80 1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 (per cent) Gross Domestic Product All Developing Countries 4.9 1.3 0.2 0.8 2.1 2.5 Developing Countries Excluding Large Countries 4.5 1.0 0.6 0.1 1.5 1.4 Per Capita GDP All developing Countries 2.4 1.0 2.1 1.5 0.2 0.2 Developing Countries Excluding Large Countries 1.9 1.5 -3.1 -2.4 -1.0 1.1 Source: Department of International Economic and So cial Affairs, Doubling Development Finance: Meeting a United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. Global Challenge, Views and Recommendations of the Committee on Development and Planning (New York: UN, 1986) 37. The heaviest burden in international economic a djustment has been carried by the world's poorest p eople. The consequence has been a considerable increase in human distress and the overexploitation of land an d natural resources to ensure survival in the short t erm. 38. Many international economic problems remain unr esolved: Developing country indebtedness remains serious; commodity and energy markets are highly un stable; financial flows to developing countries are seriously deficient; protectionism and trade wars a re a serious threat. Yet at a time when multilatera l institutions, and rules, are more than ever necessa ry, they have been devalued. And the notion of an international responsibility for development has vi rtually disappeared. The trend is towards a decline in multilateralism and an assertion of national domina nce. II. New Approaches to Environment and Development 39. Human progress has always depended on our techn ical ingenuity and a capacity for cooperative actio n. These qualities have often been used constructively to achieve development and environmental progress: in air and water pollution control, for example, and in in creasing the efficiency of material and energy use. Many countries have increased food production and reduce d population growth rates. Some technological advan ces, particularly in medicine, have been widely shared. 40. But this is not enough. Failures to manage the environment and to sustain development threaten to overwhelm all countries. Environment and developmen t are not separate challenges; they are inexorably linked. Development cannot subsist upon a deteriora ting environmental resource base; the environment c annot be protected when growth leaves out of account the costs of environmental destruction. These problems cannot be treated separately by fragmented institut ions and policies. They are linked in a complex sys tem of cause and effect. 41. First, environmental stresses are linked one to another. For example, deforestation, by increasing run off, accelerates soil erosion and siltation of rivers an d lakes. Air pollution and acidification play their part in killing forests and lakes. Such links mean that several dif ferent problems must be tackled simultaneously. And success in one area, such as forest protection, can improve chances of success in another area, such a s soil conservation. 42. Second, environmental stresses and patterns of economic development are linked one to another. Thu s agricultural policies may lie at the root of land, water, and forest degradation. Energy policies are associated with the global greenhouse effect, with acidificati on, and with deforestation for fuelwood in many dev eloping nations. These stresses all threaten economic devel opment. Thus economics and ecology must be complete ly integrated in decision making and lawmaking process es not just to protect the environment, but also to protect and promote development. Economy is not just about the production of wealth, and ecology is not just a bout the protection of nature; they are both equally rel evant for improving the lot of humankind. How long can we go on and safely pretend that the e nvironment is not the economy, is not health, is no t the prerequisite to development, is not recreation? Is it realistic to see ourselves as managers of an ent ity out there called the environment, extraneous to us, an altern ative to the economy, too expensive a value to prot ect in difficult economic times? When we organize ourselve s starting from this premise, we do so with dangero us consequences to our economy, health, and industrial growth. We are now just beginning to realize that we must f ind an alternative to our ingrained behaviour of bu rdening future generations resulting from our misplaced bel ief that there is a choice between economy and the environment. That choice, in the long term, turns o ut to be an illusion with awesome consequences for humanity.

Third, environmental and economic problems are linked to many social and political factors. For ex ample, the rapid population growth that has so profound an impact on the environment and on development in ma ny regions is driven partly by such factors as the sta tus of women in society and other cultural values. Also, environmental stress and uneven development can inc rease social tensions. It could be argued that the distribution of power and influence within society lies at the heart of most environment and developme nt challenges. Hence new approaches must involve progr ammes of social development, particularly to improv e the position of women in society, to protect vulner able groups, and to promote local participation in decision making. 44. Finally, the systemic features operate not mere ly within but also between nations. National bounda ries have become so porous that traditional distinctions betw een matters of local, national, and international s ignificance have become blurred. Ecosystems do not respect nati onal boundaries. Water pollution moves through shar ed rivers, lakes, and seas. The atmosphere carries air pollution over vast distances. Major accidents - p articularly those at nuclear reactors or at plants or warehouse s containing toxic materials - can have widespread regional effects. 45. Many environment economy links also operate glo bally. For instance, the highly subsidized, incenti ve- driven agriculture of industrialized market economi es generates surpluses that depress prices and erod e the viability of the often neglected agriculture of dev eloping countries. Soils and other environmental re sources suffer in both systems. Each country may devise nat ional agricultural policies to secure short-tern ec onomic and political gains, but no nation alone can devise policies to deal effectively with the financial, e conomic, and ecological costs of the agricultural and trade poli cies of other nations. To successfully advance in solving global problems, we need to develop new methods of thinking, to ela borate new moral and value criteria, and, no doubt, new pa tterns of behaviour. Mankind is on the threshold of a new stage in its d evelopment. We should not only promote the expansio n of its material, scientific, and technical basis, but, wha t is most important, the formation of new value and humanistic aspirations in human psychology, since wisdom and h umaneness are the 'eternal truths' that make the ba sis of humanity. We need new social, moral, scientific, an d ecological concepts, which should be determined b y new conditions for the life of mankind today and in the future. I.T. Frolov Editor-in-Chief, Communist Magazine WCED Public Hearing Moscow, 6 Dec 1986 46. In the past, responsibility for environmental m atters has been placed in environmental ministries and institutions that often have had little or no contr ol over destruction caused by agricultural, industr ial, urban development, forestry, and transportation policies and practices. Society has failed to give the respo nsibility for preventing environmental damage to the 'sectoral' m inistries and agencies whose policies cause it. Thu s our environmental management practices have focused lar gely upon after-the-fact repair of damage: reforest ation, reclaiming desert lands, rebuilding urban environme nts, restoring natural habitats, and rehabilitating wild lands. The ability to anticipate and prevent environmental damage will require that the ecological dimensions of policy be considered at the same time as the economic, tra de, energy, agricultural, and other dimensions. 47. In most countries, environmental policies are d irected at the symptoms of harmful growth; these po licies have brought progress and rewards and must be conti nued and strengthened. But that will not be enough. What is required is a new approach in which all nat ions aim at a type of development that integrates p roduction with resource conservation and enhancement, and tha t links both to the provision for all of an adequat e livelihood base and equitable access to resources. 48. The concept of sustainable development provides a framework for the integration of environment pol icies and development strategies - the term 'development' being used here in its broadest sense. The word is often taken to refer to the processes of economic and soc ial change in the Third World. But the integration of environment and development is required in all coun tries, rich and poor. The pursuit of sustainable development requires changes in the domestic and in ternational policies of every nation.

You talk very little about life, you talk too much about survival. It is very important to remember th at when the possibilities for life are over, the possibilities for survival start. And there are peoples here in B razil, especially in the Amazon region, who still live, and these people s that still live don't want to reach down to the l evel of survival. Speaker from the floor WCED Public Hearing Sao Paulo, 26-29 Oct 1985 49. Sustainable development seeks to meet the needs and aspirations of the present without compromisin g the ability to meet those of the future. Far from requi ring the cessation of economic growth, it recognize s that the problems of poverty and underdevelopment cannot be solved unless we have a new era of growth in which developing countries play a large role and reap lar ge benefits. 50. Economic growth always brings risk of environme ntal damage, as it puts increased pressure on environmental resources. But policy makers guided b y the concept of sustainable development will neces sarily work to assure that growing economies remain firmly attached to their ecological roots and that these roots are protected and nurtured so that they may support gro wth over the long term. Environmental protection is thus inherent in the concept of sustainable development, as is a focus on the sources of environmental prob lems rather than the symptoms. 51. No single blueprint of sustainability will be f ound, as economic and social systems and ecological conditions differ widely among countries. Each nation will hav e to work out its own concrete policy implications. Yet irrespective of these differences, sustainable deve lopment should be seen as a global objective. 52. No country can develop in isolation from others . Hence the pursuit of sustainable development requ ires a new orientation in international relations. Long te rm sustainable growth will requite far-reaching cha nges to produce trade, capital, and technology flows that a re more equitable and better synchronized to enviro nmental imperatives. 53. The mechanics of increased international cooper ation required to assure sustainable development wi ll vary from sector to sector and in relation to particular institutions. But it is fundamental that the trans ition to sustainable development be managed jointly by all n ations. The unity of human needs requires a functio ning multilateral system that respects the democratic pr inciple of consent and accepts that not only the Ea rth but also the world is one. 54. In the chapters that follow we examine these is sues in greater detail and make a number of specifi c proposals for responding to the crises of a threate ned future. Overall, our report carries a message o f hope. But it is hope conditioned upon the establishment of a new era of international cooperation based on the p remise that every human being - those here and those who a re to come - has the right to life, and to a decent life. We confidently believe that the international communit y can rise, as it must, to the challenge of securin g sustainable human progress.

Merging Environment and Economics in Decision Makin g Conclusion United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 1. Sustainable development is development that meet s the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own nee ds. It contains within it two key concepts: the concept of 'needs', in particular the essentia l needs of the world's poor, to which overriding pr iority should be given; and the idea of limitations imposed by the state of te chnology and social organization on the environment 's ability to meet present and future needs. 2. Thus the goals of economic and social developmen t must be defined in terms of sustainability in all countries - developed or developing, market-oriented or centr ally planned. Interpretations will vary, but must s hare certain general features and must flow from a consensus on the basic concept of sustainable development and on a broad strategic framework for achieving it. 3. Development involves a progressive transformatio n of economy and society. A development path that i s sustainable in a physical sense could theoretically be pursued even in a rigid social and political se tting. But physical sustainability cannot be secured unless de velopment policies pay attention to such considerat ions as changes in access to resources and in the distribut ion of costs and benefits. Even the narrow notion o f physical sustainability implies a concern for social equity between generations, a concern that must logically be extended to equity within each generation. I. The Concept of Sustainable Development 4 The satisfaction of human needs and aspirations i n the major objective of development. The essential needs of vast numbers of people in developing countries f or food, clothing, shelter, jobs - are not being me t, and beyond their basic needs these people have legitima te aspirations for an improved quality of life. A w orld in which poverty and inequity are endemic will always be prone to ecological and other crises. Sustainabl e development requires meeting the basic needs of all and extending to all the opportunity to satisfy th eir aspirations for a better life. 5. Living standards that go beyond the basic minimu m are sustainable only if consumption standards everywhere have regard for long-term sustainability . Yet many of us live beyond the world's ecological means, for instance in our patterns of energy use. Perceiv ed needs are socially and culturally determined, an d sustainable development requires the promotion of v alues that encourage consumption standards that are within the bounds of the ecological possible and to which all can reasonably aspire. 6. Meeting essential needs depends in part on achie ving full growth potential, and sustainable develop ment clearly requires economic growth in places where su ch needs are not being met. Elsewhere, it can be consistent with economic growth, provided the conte nt of growth reflects the broad principles of susta inability and non-exploitation of others. But growth by itsel f is not enough. High levels of productive activity and widespread poverty can coexist, and can endanger th e environment. Hence sustainable development requir es that societies meet human needs both by increasing productive potential and by ensuring equitable opportunities for all. 7. An expansion in numbers can increase the pressur e on resources and slow the rise in living standard s in areas where deprivation is widespread. Though the i ssue is not merely one of population size but of th e distribution of resources, sustainable development can only be pursued if demographic developments are in harmony with the changing productive potential of t he ecosystem. 8. A society may in many ways compromise its abilit y to meet the essential needs of its people in the future - by overexploiting resources, for example. The directio n of technological developments may solve some imme diate problems but lead to even greater ones. Large secti ons of the population may be marginalized by ill-co nsidered development. 9. Settled agriculture, the diversion of watercours es, the extraction of minerals, the emission of hea t and noxious gases into the atmosphere, commercial fores ts, and genetic manipulation are all examples or hu man intervention in natural systems during the course o f development. Until recently, such interventions w ere small in scale and their impact limited. Today's interven tions are more drastic in scale and impact, and mor e United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. threatening to life-support systems both locally an d globally. This need not happen. At a minimum, sus tainable development must not endanger the natural systems t hat support life on Earth: the atmosphere, the wate rs, the soils, and the living beings. 10. Growth has no set limits in terms of population or resource use beyond which lies ecological disas ter. Different limits hold for the use of energy, materi als, water, and land. Many of these will manifest t hemselves in the form of rising costs and diminishing returns, r ather than in the form of any sudden loss of a reso urce base. The accumulation of knowledge and the development o f technology can enhance the carrying capacity of t he resource base. But ultimate limits there are, and s ustainability requires that long before these are r eached, the world must ensure equitable access to the constrain ed resource and reorient technological efforts to r elieve the presume. A communications gap has kept environmental, popula tion, and development assistance groups apart for t oo long, preventing us from being aware of our common interest and realizing our combined power. Fortunat ely, the gap is closing. We now know that what unites us is vastly more important than what divides us. We recognize that poverty, environmental degradatio n, and population growth are inextricably related a nd that none of these fundamental problems can be successfu lly addressed in isolation. We will succeed or fail together. Arriving at a commonly accepted definition of 'sust ainable development' remains a challenge for all th e actors in the development process. 'Making Common Cause' U.S. Based Development, Environment, Population NGO s WCED Public Hearing Ottawa, 26-27 May 1986 11. Economic growth and development obviously invol ve changes in the physical ecosystem. Every ecosyst em everywhere cannot be preserved intact. A forest may be depleted in one part of a watershed and extende d elsewhere, which is not a bad thing if the exploita tion has been planned and the effects on soil erosi on rates, water regimes, and genetic losses have been taken i nto account. In general, renewable resources like f orests and fish stocks need not be depleted provided the r ate of use is within the limits of regeneration and natural growth. But most renewable resources are part of a complex and interlinked ecosystem, and maximum sustainable yield must be defined after taking into account system-wide effects of exploitation. 12. As for non-renewable resources, like fossil fue ls and minerals, their use reduces the stock availa ble for future generations. But this does not mean that suc h resources should not be used. In general the rate of depletion should take into account the criticality of that resource, the availability of technologies tor minimizing depletion, and the likelihood of substitutes being available. Thus land should not be degraded beyond reasonable recovery. With minerals and fossil fuels , the rate of depletion and the emphasis on recycli ng and economy of use should be calibrated to ensure that the resource does not run out before acceptable sub stitutes are available. Sustainable development requires tha t the rate of depletion of non renewable resources should foreclose as few future options as possible. 13. Development tends to simplify ecosystems and to reduce their diversity of species. And species, on ce extinct, are not renewable. The loss of plant and a nimal species can greatly limit the options of futu re generations; so sustainable development requires th e conservation of plant and animal species. 14. So-called free goods like air and water are als o resources. The raw materials and energy of produc tion processes are only partly converted to useful produ cts. The rest comes out as wastes. Sustainable development requires that the adverse impacts on th e quality of air, water, and other natural elements are minimized so as to sustain the ecosystem's overall integrity. 15. In essence, sustainable development is a proces s of change in which the exploitation of resources, the direction of investments, the orientation of techno logical development; and institutional change are a ll in harmony and enhance both current and future potenti al to meet human needs and aspirations. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. II. Equity and the Common Interest 16. Sustainable development has been described here in general terms. How are individuals in the real world to be persuaded or made to act in the common interest? The answer lies partly in education, institutional development, and law enforcement. But many problems of resource depletion and environmental stress ari se from disparities in economic and political power. A n industry may get away with unacceptable levels or air and water pollution because the people who bear the bru nt of it are poor and unable to complain effectivel y. A forest may be destroyed by excessive felling because the p eople living there have no alternatives or because timber contractors generally have more influence then fore st dwellers. 17. Ecological interactions do not respect the boun daries of individual ownership and political jurisd iction. Thus: In a watershed, the ways in which a farmer up the slope uses land directly affect run-off on farms downstream. the irrigation practices, pesticides, and fertiliz ers used on one farm affect the productivity of nei ghbouring ones, especially among small farms. The efficiency of a factory boiler determines its rate of emission of soot and noxious chemicals and affects all who live and work around it. The hot water discharged by a thermal power plant into a river or a local sea affects the catch of al l who fish locally. 18. Traditional social systems recognized some aspe cts of this interdependence and enforced community control over agricultural practices and traditional rights relating to water, forests, and land. This enforcement of the 'common interest' did not necessarily impede gr owth and expansion though it may have limited the acceptance and diffusion of technical innovations. 19. Local interdependence has, if anything, increas ed because of the technology used in modern agricul ture and manufacturing. Yet with this surge of technical progress, the growing 'enclosure' of common lands, the erosion of common rights in forests and other resou rces, and the spread of commerce and production for the market, the responsibilities for decision making ar e being taken away from both groups and individuals . This shift is still under way in many developing countri es. If the desert is growing, forest disappearing, maln utrition increasing, and people in urban areas livi ng in very bad conditions, it is not because we are lacking re sources but the kind of policy implemented by our r ulers, by the elite group. Denying people rights and peoples' interests is pushing us to a situation where it is only the poverty that has a very prosperous future in Africa . And it is our hope that your Commission, the Worl d Commission, will not overlook these problems of hum an rights in Africa and will put emphasis on it. Be cause it is only free people, people who have rights, who ar e mature and responsible citizens, who then partici pate in the development and in the protection of the enviro nment. Speaker from the floor WCED Public Hearing Nairobi, 23 Sept 1986 20. It is not that there is one set of villains and another of victims. All would be better off if eac h person took into account the effect o\" his or her acts upon others. But each is unwilling to assume that others will b ehave in this socially desirable fashion, and hence all cont inue to pursue narrow self-interest. Communities or governments can compensate for this isolation throu gh laws, education, taxes, subsidies, and other met hods. Well-enforced laws and strict liability legislation can control harmful side effects. Most important, effective participation in decision-making processes by local communities can help them articulate and effective ly enforce their common interest. 21. Interdependence is not simply a local phenomeno n. Rapid growth in production has extended it to th e international plane, with both physical and economi c manifestations. There are growing global and regi onal pollution effects, such as in the more than 200 int ernational river basins and the large number of sha red seas. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 22. The enforcement of common interest often suffer s because areas of political jurisdiction and areas of impact do not coincide. Energy policies in one juri sdiction cause acid precipitation in another. The f ishing policies of one state affect the fish catch of anot her. No supranational authority exists to resolve s uch issues, and the common interest can only be articulated thr ough international cooperation. 23. In the same way, the ability of a government to control its national economy is reduced by growing international economic interactions. For example, f oreign trade in commodities makes issues of carryin g capacities and resource scarcities an international concern. (See Chapter 3 .) If economic power and the benefits of trade were more equally distributed, co mmon interests would be generally recognized. But t he gains from trade are unequally distributed, and patterns of trade in, say, sugar affect not merely a local s ugar- producing sector, but the economies and ecologies o f the many developing countries that depend heavily on this product. 24. The search for common interest would be less di fficult if all development and environment problems had solutions that would leave everyone better off. Thi s is seldom the case, and there are usually winners and losers. Many problems arise from inequalities in ac cess to resources. An inequitable landowner ship st ructure can lead to overexploitation of resources in the sm allest holdings, with harmful effects on both envir onment and development. Internationally, monopolistic control over resources can drive those who do not share in them to excessive exploitation of marginal resources. The d iffering capacities of exploiters to commandeer 'fr ee' goods - locally, nationally, and internationally - is ano ther manifestation of unequal access to resources. 'Losers' in environment/development conflicts include those who suffer more than their fair share of the health, p roperty, and ecosystem damage costs of pollution. 25. As a system approaches ecological limits, inequ alities sharpen. Thus when a watershed deteriorates , poor farmers suffer more because they cannot afford the same anti-erosion measures as richer farmers. When urban air quality deteriorates, the poor, in their more vulnerable areas, suffer more health damage th an the rich, who usually live in more pristine neighbourhoods. W hen mineral resources become depleted, late-comers to the industrialization process lose the benefits of low-cost supplies. Globally, wealthier nations are better placed financially and technologically to cope with the ef fects of possible climatic change. 26. Hence, our inability to promote the common inte rest in sustainable development is often a product of the relative neglect of economic and social justice wit hin and amongst nations. III. Strategic Imperatives 27. The world must quickly design strategies that w ill allow nations to move from their present, often destructive, processes of growth and development on to sustainable development paths. This will require policy changes in all countries, with respect both to thei r own development and to their impacts on other nat ions' development possibilities. (This chapter concerns i tself with national strategies. The required reorie ntation in international economic relations is dealt with in Chapter 3 .) 28. Critical objectives for environment and develop ment policies that follow from the concept of susta inable development include: reviving growth; changing the quality of growth; meeting essential needs for jobs, food, energy, wa ter, and sanitation; ensuring a sustainable level of population; conserving and enhancing the resource base: reorienting technology and managing risk; and merging environment and economics in decision maki ng. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 1. Reviving Growth 29. As indicated earlier, development that is susta inable has to address the problem of the large numb er of people who live in absolute poverty - that is, w ho are unable to satisfy even the most basic of the ir needs. Poverty reduces people's capacity to use res ources in a sustainable manner; it intensifies pressure on the environment. Most such absolute pov erty is in developing countries; in many, it has be en aggravated by the economic stagnation of the 1980s. A necessary but not a sufficient condition for the elimination of absolute poverty is a relatively rap id rise in per capita incomes in the Third World. I t is therefore essential that the stagnant or declining growth trends of this decade be reversed. 30. While attainable growth rates will vary, a cert ain minimum is needed to have any impact on absolut e poverty. It seems unlikely that, taking developing countries as a whole, these objectives can be accomplished with per capita income growth of under 3 per cent. (See Box 2-1.) Given current populatio n growth rates, this would require overall national i ncome growth of around 5 per cent a year in the developing economies of Asia, 5.5 per cent in Latin America, and 6 per cent in Africa and West Asia. 31. Are these orders of magnitude attainable? The r ecord in South and East Asia over the past quarter- century and especially over the last five years sug gests that 5 per cent annual growth can be attained in most countries, including the two largest, India an d China. In Latin America, average growth rates on the order of 5 per cent were achieved during the 1960s and 1970s, but fell well below that in the first ha lf of this decade, mainly because of the debt crisis. /1 A revival of Latin American growth depends on the resolution of this crisis. In Africa, growth rates during the 1960s and 1970s were around 4-4.5 per ce nt, which at current rates of population growth would m ean per capita income growth of only a little over 1 per cent. /2 Moreover, during the 1980s, growth nearly halted a nd in two-thirds of the countries per capita income declined. /3 Attaining a minimum level of growth in Africa requ ires the correction of short-term imbalances, and also the removal of deep-rooted con straints on the growth process. 32. Growth must be revived in developing countries because that is where the links between economic growth, the alleviation of poverty, and environment al conditions operate most directly. Yet developing countries are part of an interdependent world econo my; their prospects also depend on the levels and patterns of growth in industrialized nations. The m edium-term prospects for industrial countries are f or growth of 3-4 per cent, the minimum that internatio nal financial institutions consider necessary if th ese countries are going to play a part in expanding the world economy. Such growth rates could be environmentally sustainable if industrialized natio ns can continue the recent shifts in the content of their growth towards less material- and energy-intensive activities and the improvement of their efficiency in using materials and energy. Box 2-1 Growth, Redistribution, and Poverty 1. The poverty line is that level of income below w hich an individual or household cannot afford on a regular basis the necessities of life. The percenta ge of the population below that line will depend on per capita national income and the manner in which it i s distributed. How quickly can a developing country expect to eliminate absolute poverty? The answer wi ll vary from country to country, but much can be learned from a typical case. 2. Consider a nation in which half the population l ives below the poverty line and where the distribut ion of household incomes is as follows: the top one-fif th of households have 50 per cent of total income, the next fifth have 20 per cent, the next fifth have 14 per cent, the next fifth have 9 per cent, and the bottom fifth have just 7 per cent. This is a fair represen tation of the situation in many low-income developi ng countries. 3. In this case, if the income distribution remains unchanged, per capita national income would have t o double before the poverty ratio drops from 50 to 10 per cent. If income is redistributed in favour of the poor, this reduction can occur sooner. Consider the case in which 25 per cent of the incremental incom e of the richest one-fifth of the population is redis tributed equally to the others. The assumptions her e about redistribution reflect three judgements. First, in most situations redistributive policies can only op erate on increases in income. Second, in low-income developi ng countries the surplus that can be skimmed off fo r redistribution is available only from the wealthier groups. Third, redistributive policies cannot be s o United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. precisely targeted that they deliver benefits only to those who are below the poverty line, so some of the benefits will accrue to those who are just a little above it. 4. The number of years required to bring the povert y ratio down from 50 to 10 per cent ranges from: o 18-24 years if per capita income grows at 3 per ce nt, o 26-36 years if it grown at 2 per cent, and o 51-70 years if it grows only at 1 per cent. In each case, the shorter time is associated with t he redistribution of 25 per cent of the incremental income of the richest fifth of the population and t he longer period with no redistribution. 5. So with per capita national income growing only at 1 per cent a year, the time required to eliminat e absolute poverty would stretch well into the next c entury. If, however, the aim is to ensure that the world is well on its way towards sustainable development by the beginning of the next century, it is necessary to aim at a minimum of 3 per cent per capita national income growth and to pursue vigorous redistributive policies. 33. As industrialized nations use less materials an d energy, however, they will provide smaller market s for commodities and minerals from the developing nation s. Yet if developing nations focus their efforts up on eliminating poverty and satisfying essential human needs, then domestic demand will increase for both agricultural products and manufactured goods and so me services. Hence the very logic of sustainable development implies an internal stimulus to Third W orld growth. 34. Nonetheless, in large numbers of developing cou ntries markets are very small; and for all developi ng countries high export growth, especially of non-tra ditional items, will also be necessary to finance i mports, demand for which will be generated by rapid develop ment. Thus a reorientation of international economi c relations will be necessary for sustainable develop ment, as discussed in Chapter 3 . 2. Changing the quality of Growth 35. Sustainable development involves more than grow th. It requires a change in the content of growth, to make it less Material- and energy-intensive and mor e equitable in its impact. These changes are requir ed in all countries as part of a package of measures t o maintain the stock of ecological capital, to impr ove the distribution of income, and to reduce the degree of vulnerability to economic crises. 36. The process of economic development must be mor e soundly based upon the realities of the stock of capital that sustains it. This is rarely done in ei ther developed or developing countries. For example , income from forestry operations is conventionally m easured in terms of the value of timber and other products extracted, minus the costs of extraction. The costs of regenerating the forest are not taken into account, unless money is actually spent on such wor k. Thus figuring profits from logging rarely takes full account of the losses in future revenue incurred th rough degradation of the forest. Similar incomplete accounting occurs in the exploitation of other natu ral resources, especially in the case of resources that are not capitalized in enterprise or national accou nts: air, water, and soil. In all countries, rich o r poor, economic development must take full account in its measurements of growth of the improvement or deterioration in the stock of natural resources. 37. Income distribution is one aspect of the qualit y of growth, as described in the preceding section, and rapid growth combined with deteriorating income dis tribution may be worse than slower growth combined with redistribution in favour of the poor. For inst ance, in many developing countries the introduction of large-scale commercial agriculture may produce reve nue rapidly, but may also dispossess a large number of small farmers and make income distribution more inequitable. In the long run, such a path may not b e sustainable; it impoverishes many people and can in crease pressures on the natural resource base through overcommercialized agriculture and through the marginalization of subsistence farmers. Relying more on smallholder cultivation may be slower at fi rst, but more easily sustained over the long term. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. People have acquired, often for the first time in h istory, both an idea of their relative poverty and a desire to emerge from it and improve the quality of their lives. As people advance materially, and eat and li ve better, what, were once luxuries tend to be regarde d as necessities. The net result is that the demand for food, raw materials, and power increases to an even greater degree than the population. As demand increases, a greater and greater strain is put on t he finite area of the world's land to produce the p roducts needed. Dr. I. P. Garbouchev Bulgarian Academy of Sciences WCED Public Hearing Moscow, 11 Dec 1986 38. Economic development is unsustainable if it inc reases vulnerability to crises. A drought may force farmers to slaughter animals needed for sustaining production in future years. A drop in prices may ca use farmers or other producers to overexploit natural r esources to maintain incomes. But vulnerability can be reduced by using technologies that lower production risks, by choosing institutional options that redu ce market fluctuations, and by building up reserves, e specially of food and foreign exchange. A developme nt path that combines growth with reduced vulnerabilit y is more sustainable than one that does not. 39. Yet it is not enough to broaden the range of ec onomic variables taken into account. Sustainability requires views of human needs and well-being that i ncorporate such non-economic variables as education and health enjoyed for their own sake, cl ean air and water, and the protection of natural be auty. It must also work to remove disabilities from disad vantaged groups, many of whom live in ecologically vulnerable areas, such as many tribal groups in for ests, desert nomads, groups in remote hill areas, a nd indigenous peoples of the Americas and Australasia. 40. Changing the quality of growth requires changin g our approach to development efforts to take accou nt of all of their effects. For instance, a hydropower project should not be seen merely as a way of prod ucing more electricity; its effects upon the local enviro nment and the livelihood of the local community mus t be included in any balance sheets. Thus the abandonmen t of a hydro project because it will disturb a rare ecological system could be a measure of progress, n ot a setback to development. /4 Nevertheless, in some cases, sustainability considerations will invo lve a rejection of activities that are financially attractive in the short run. 41. Economic and social development can and should be mutually reinforcing. Money spent on education and health can raise human productivity. Economic d evelopments can accelerate social development by providing opportunities for underprivileged groups or by spreading education more rapidly. 3. Meeting Essential Human Needs 42. The satisfaction of human needs and aspirations is so obviously an objective of productive activit y that it may appear redundant to assert its central role in the concept of sustainable development. All too often poverty is such that people cannot satisfy their ne eds for survival and well-being even if goods and services are available. At the same time, the deman ds of those not in poverty may have major environmental consequences. 43. The principal development challenge is to meet the needs and aspirations of an expanding developin g world population. The most basic of all needs is fo r a livelihood: that is, employment. Between 1985 a nd 2000 the labour force in developing countries will increase by nearly 800 million, and new livelihood opportunities will have to be generated for 60 mill ion persons every year. /5 The pace and pattern of economic development have to generate sustainable w ork opportunities on this scale and at a level of productivity that would enable poor households to m eet minimum consumption standards. 44. More food is required not merely to feed more p eople but to attack undernourishment. For the developing world to eat, person for person, as well as the industrial world by the year 2000, annual increases of 5.0 per cent in calories and 5.8 per c ent in proteins are needed in Africa; of 3.4 and 4. 0 per cent, respectively, in Latin America; and of 3.5 an d 4.5 per cent in Asia. /6 Foodgrains and starchy roots United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. are the primary sources of calories, while proteins are obtained primarily from products like milk, me at, fish, pulses, and oil-seeds. 45. Though the focus at present is necessarily on s taple foods, the projections given above also highl ight the need for a high rate of growth of protein avail ability. In Africa, the task is particularly challe nging given the recent declining per capita food production and the current constraints on growth. In Asia and Lat in America, the required growth rates in calorie and p rotein consumption seem to be more readily attainab le. But increased food production should not be based o n ecologically unsound production policies and compromise long-term prospects for food security. 46. Energy is another essential human need, one tha t cannot be universally met unless energy consumption patterns change. The most urgent proble m is the requirements of poor Third World households, which depend mainly on fuelwood. By the turn of the century, 3 billion people may live in areas where wood is cut faster than it grows or whe re fuelwood is extremely scarce. /7 Corrective action would both reduce the drudgery of collecting wood o ver long distances and preserve the ecological base . The minimum requirements for cooking fuel in most d eveloping countries appear to be on the order of 25 0 kilogrammes of coal equivalent per capita per year. This is a fraction of the household energy consumption in industrial countries. In the developing world, mostly in the Third World, we realize that the main problem we have is that w e do not have employment opportunities, and most of thes e people who are unemployed move from rural areas and they migrate into the cities and those wh o remain behind always indulge in processes - for example charcoal burning - and all this leads to de forestation. So maybe the environmental organizatio ns should step in and look for ways to prevent this ki nd of destruction. Kennedy Njiro Student, Kenya Polytechnic WCED Public Hearing Nairobi, 23 Sept 1986 47. The linked basic needs of housing, water supply , sanitation, and health care are also environmenta lly important. Deficiencies in these areas are often vi sible manifestations of environmental stress. In th e Third World, the failure to meet these key needs is one of the major causes of many communicable diseases such as malaria, gastro-intestinal infesta tions, cholera, and typhoid. Population growth and the drift into cities threaten to make these problems w orse. Planners must find ways of relying more on supporting community initiatives and self-help effo rts and on effectively using low-cost technologies. See Chapter 9 . 4. Ensuring a Sustainable Level of Population 48. The sustainability of development is intimately linked to the dynamics of population growth. The i ssue, however, is not simply one of global population siz e. A child born in a country where levels of materi al and energy use are high places a greater burden on the Earth's resources than a child born in a poorer country. A similar argument applies within countrie s. Nonetheless, sustainable development can be pursued more easily when population size is stabili zed at a level consistent with the productive capac ity of the ecosystem. 49. In industrial countries, the overall rate of po pulation growth is under 1 per cent, and several co untries have reached or are approaching zero population gro wth. The total population of the industrialized wor ld could increase from its current 1.2 billion to abou t 1.4 billion in the year 2025. /8 50. The greater part of global population increase will take place in developing countries, where the 1985 population of 3.7 billion may increase to 6.8 billi on by 2025. /9 The Third World does not have the option of migration to 'new' lands, and the time available fo r adjustment is much less than industrial countries had. Hence the challenge now is to quickly lower populat ion growth rates, especially in regions such as Afr ica, where these rates are increasing. 51. Birth rates declined in industrial countries la rgely because of economic and social development. Rising levels of income and urbanization and the ch anging role of women all played important roles. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. Similar processes are now at work in developing cou ntries. These should be recognized and encouraged. Population policies should be integrated with other economic and social development programmes female education, health care, and the expansion of the li velihood base of the poor. But time is short, and developing countries will also have to promote dire ct measures to reduce fertility, to avoid going rad ically beyond the productive potential to support their po pulations. In fact, increased access to family plan ning services is itself a form of social development tha t allows couples, and women in particular, the righ t to self-determination. 52. Population growth in developing countries will remain unevenly distributed between rural and urban areas. UK projections suggest that by the first dec ade of the next century, the absolute size of rural populations in most developing countries will start declining. Nearly 90 per cent of the increase in t he developing world will take place in urban areas, th e population of which in expected to rise from 1.15 billion in 1985 to 3.25 million in 2025. /10 The increase will be particularly marked in Africa and, to a lesser extent, in Asia. 53. Developing-country cities are growing much fast er than the capacity of authorities to cope. Shorta ges of housing, water, sanitation, and mass transit are widespread. A growing proportion of city-dwellers live in slums and shanty towns, many of them exposed to air and water pollution and to industrial and natur al hazards. Further deterioration is likely, given tha t most urban growth will take place in the largest cities. Thus more manageable cities may be the principal ga in from slower rates of population growth. 54. Urbanization is itself part of the development process. The challenge is to manage the process so as to avoid a severe deterioration in the quality of l ife. Thus the development of smaller urban centres needs to be encouraged to reduce pressures in large citie s. Solving the impending urban crisis will require the promotion of self-help housing and urban services b y and for the poor, and a more positive approach to the role of the informal sector, supported by suffi cient funds for water supply, sanitation, and other services. See Chapter 9 . 5. Conserving and Enhancing the Resource Base 55. If needs are to be met on a sustainable basis t he Earth's natural resource base must be conserved and enhanced. Major changes in policies will be nee ded to cope with the industrial world's current hig h levels of consumption, the increases in consumption needed to meet minimum standards in developing countries, and expected population growth. However, the case for the conservation of nature should not rest only with development goals. It is part of our moral obligation to other living beings and future generations. 56. Pressure on resources increases when people lac k alternatives. Development policies must widen people's options for earning a sustainable liveliho od, particularly for resource-poor households and i n areas under ecological stress. In a hilly area, for instance, economic self-interest and ecology can b e combined by helping farmers shift from grain to tre e crops by providing them with advice, equipment, a nd marketing assistance. Programmes to protect the inc omes of farmers, fishermen, and foresters against short-term price declines may decrease their need t o overexploit resources. 57. The conservation of agricultural resources is a n urgent task because in many parts of the world cultivation has already been extended to marginal l ands, and fishery and forestry resources have been overexploited. These resources must be conserved an d enhanced to meet the needs of growing populations. Land use in agriculture and forestry m ust be based on a scientific assessment of land capacity, and the annual depletion of topsoil, fish stock, or forest resources must not exceed the rat e of regeneration. 58. The pressures on agricultural land from crop an d livestock production can be partly relieved by increasing productivity. But short-sighted, short-t erm improvements in productivity can create differe nt forms of ecological stress, such as the loss of gen etic diversity in standing crops, salinization and alkalization of irrigated lands, nitrate pollution of ground-water, and pesticide residues in food. Ec ologically more benign alternatives are available. Future incr eases in productivity, in both developed and develo ping countries, should be based on the better controlled application of water and agrochemicals, as well as on United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. more extensive use of organic manures and non-chemi cal means of pest control. These alternatives can be promoted only by an agricultural policy based on ecological realities. (See Chapter 5 .) 59. In the case of fisheries and tropical forestry, we rely largely on the exploitation of the natural ly available stocks. The sustainable yield from these stocks may well fall short of demand. Hence it will be necessary to turn to methods that produce more fish , fuelwood, and forest products under controlled conditions. Substitutes for fuelwood can be promote d. 60. The ultimate limits to global development are p erhaps determined by the availability of energy resources and by the biosphere's capacity to absorb the by-products of energy use. /11 / These energy limits may be approached far sooner than the limits imposed by other material resources. First, there are the supply problems: the depletion of oil reserves, the high cost and environmental impact of coal min ing, and the hazards of nuclear technology. Second, ther e are emission problems, most notably acid pollutio n and carbon dioxide build up leading to global warmi ng. I work with rubber trees in the Amazon. I am here t o speak about the tropical forest. We live from this forest they want to destroy. And we want to take this opportunity of having so many people here gathered with the same objective in min d to defend our habitat, the conservation of forest , of tropical forest. In my area, we have about 14-16 native products tha t we extract from the forest, besides all the other activities we have. So I think this must be preserv ed. Because it is not only with cattle, not only wi th pasture lands, and not only with highways that we w ill be able to develop the Amazon. When they think of falling trees, they always think of building roads and the roads bring destruction under a mask called progress. Let us put this progress wh ere the lands have already been deforested, where i t is idle of labour and where we have to find people work, and where we have to make the city grow. But let us leave those who want to live in the forest, who want to keep it as it is. We have nothing written. I don't have anything that was created in somebody's office. There is no philosophy. It is just the real truth, because this is what our life is. Jaime Da Silva Araujo Rubber Tapper Council WCED Public Hearing Sao Paulo, 28-29 Oct 1985 61. Some of these problems can be met by increased use of renewable energy sources. But the exploitation of renewable sources such as fuelwood and hydropower also entails ecological problems. Hence sustainability requires a clear focus on cons erving and efficiently using energy. 62. Industrialized countries must recognize that th eir energy consumption is polluting the biosphere a nd eating into scarce fossil fuel supplies. Recent imp rovements in energy efficiency and a shift towards less energy-intensive sectors have helped limit consumpt ion. But the process must be accelerated to reduce per capita consumption and encourage a shift to non polluting sources and technologies. The simple duplication in the developing world of industrial c ountries' energy use patterns is neither feasible n or desirable. Changing these patterns for the better w ill call for new policies in urban development, ind ustry location, housing design, transportation systems, a nd the choice of agricultural and industrial technologies. 63. Non-fuel mineral resources appear to pose fewer supply problems. Studies done before 1960 that assumed an exponentially growing demand did not env isage a problem until well into the next century. /12 since then, world consumption of most metals has re mained nearly constant, which suggests that the exhaustion of non-fuel minerals is even more distan t. The history of technological developments also suggests that industry can adjust to scarcity throu gh greater efficiency in use, recycling, and substi tution. More immediate needs include modifying the pattern of world trade in minerals to allow exporters a hig her share in the value added from mineral use, and impr oving the access of developing countries to mineral supplies, as their demands increase. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. Indigenous peoples are the base of what I guess cou ld be called the environmental security system. We are the gate-keepers of success or failure to husba nd our resources. For many of us, however, the last few centuries have meant a major loss of control ov er our lands and waters. We are still the first to know about changes in the environment, but we are now th e last to be asked or consulted. We are the first to detect when the forests are bei ng threatened, as they are under the slash and grab economics of this country. And we are the last to b e asked about the future of our forests. We are the first to feel the pollution of our waters, as the Ojibway peoples of my own homelands in northern Ontario wi ll attest. And, of course, we are the last to be consu lted about how, when, and where developments should take place in order to assure continuing harmony fo r the seventh generation. The most we have learned to expect is to be compens ated, always too late and too little. We are seldom asked to help avoid the need for compensation by le nding our expertise and our consent to development. Louis Bruyere President, Native Council of Canada WCED Public Hearing Ottawa, 26-27 May 1986 64. The prevention and reduction of air and water p ollution will remain a critical task of resource conservation. Air and water quality come under pres sure from such activities as fertilizer and pestici de use, urban sewage, fossil fuel burning, the use of certain chemicals, and various other industrial act ivities. Each of these is expected to increase the pollution load on the biosphere substantially, particularly in developing countries. Cleaning up after the event i s an expensive solution. Hence all countries need t o anticipate and prevent these pollution problems, by , for instance, enforcing emission standards that r eflect likely long-term effects, promoting low-waste techn ologies, and anticipating the impact of new product s, technologies, and wastes. 6. Reorienting Technology and Managing Risk 65. The fulfilment of all these tasks will require the reorientation of technology the key link betwee n humans and nature. First, the capacity for technolo gical innovation needs to be greatly enhanced in developing countries so that they can respond more effectively to the challenges of sustainable development. Second, the orientation of technology development must be changed to pay greater attention to environmental factors. 66. The technologies of industrial countries are no t always suited or easily adaptable to the socio- economic and environmental conditions of developing countries. To compound the problem, the bulk of world research and development addresses few of the pressing issues facing these countries, such as arid-land agriculture or the control of tropical di seases. Not enough is being done to adapt recent innovations in materials technology, energy conserv ation, information technology, and biotechnology to the needs of developing countries. These gaps must be covered by enhancing research, design, development, and extension capabilities in the Thir d World. 67. In all countries, the processes of generating a lternative technologies, upgrading traditional ones , and selecting and adapting imported technologies should be informed by environmental resource concerns. Most technological research by commercial organizat ions is devoted to product and process innovations that have market value. Technologies are needed tha t produce 'social goods', such as improved air quality or increased product life, or that resolve problems normally outside the cost calculus of indi vidual enterprises, such as the external costs of pollutio n or waste disposal. 68. The role of public policy is to ensure, through incentives and disincentives, that commercial organizations find it worthwhile to take fuller acc ount of environmental factors in the technologies t hey develop. (See Chapter 6 .) Publicly funded research institutions also need such direction, and the objectives of sustainable development and environme ntal protection must be built into the mandates of the institutions that work in environmentally sensi tive areas. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 69. The development of environmentally appropriate technologies is closely related to questions of ris k management. Such systems as nuclear reactors, elect ric and other utility distribution networks, communication systems, and mass transportation are vulnerable if stressed beyond a certain point. The fact that they are connected through networks tends to make them immune to small disturbances but more vulnerable to unexpected disruptions that exce ed a finite threshold. Applying sophisticated analy ses of vulnerabilities and past failures to technology design, manufacturing standards, and contingency pl ans in operations can make the consequences of a failur e or accident much less catastrophic. 70. The best vulnerability and risk analysis has no t been applied consistently across technologies or systems. A major purpose of large system design sho uld be to make the consequences of failure or sabotage less serious. There is thus a need for new techniques and technologies - as well as legal and institutional mechanisms - for safety design and co ntrol, accident prevention, contingency planning, damage mitigation, and provision of relief. 71. Environmental risks arising from technological and developmental decisions impinge on individuals and areas that have little or no influence on those decisions. Their interests must be taken into acco unt. National and international institutional mechanisms are needed to assess potential impacts of new technologies before they are widely used, in order to ensure that their production, use, and disposal do not overstress environmental resources. Similar arr angements are required for major interventions in natural systems, such as river diversion or forest clearance. In addition, liability for damages from unintended consequences must be strengthened and en forced. 7. Merging Environment and Economics in Decision Ma king 72. The common theme throughout this strategy for s ustainable development is the need to integrate economic and ecological considerations in decision making. They are, after all, integrated in the work ings of the real world. This will require a change in at titudes and objectives and in institutional arrange ments at every level. 73. Economic and ecological concerns are not necess arily in opposition. For example, policies that conserve the quality of agricultural land and prote ct forests improve the long-term prospects for agricultural development. An increase in the effici ency of energy and material use serves ecological purposes but can also reduce costs. But the compati bility of environmental and economic objectives is often lost in the pursuit of individual or group ga ins, with little regard for the impacts on others, with a blind faith in science's ability to find solutions, and i n ignorance of the distant consequences of today's decisions. Institutional rigidities add to this myo pia. 74. One important rigidity is the tendency to deal with one industry or sector in isolation, failing t o recognize the importance of intersectoral linkages. Modern agriculture uses substantial amounts of commercially produced energy and large quantities o f industrial products. At the same time, the more traditional connection - in which agriculture is a source of raw materials for industry - is being dil uted by the widening use of synthetics. The energy-industry connection is also changing, with a strong tendenc y towards a decline in the energy intensity of indust rial production in industrial countries. In the Thi rd World, however, the gradual shift of the industrial base t owards the basic material producing sectors is lead ing to an increase in the energy intensity of industrial p roduction. 75. These inter sectoral connections create pattern s of economic and ecological interdependence rarely reflected in the ways in which policy is made. Sect oral organizations tend to pursue sectoral objectiv es and to treat their impacts on other sectors as side effects, taken into account only if compelled to d o so. Hence impacts on forests rarely worry those involve d in guiding public policy or business activities i n the fields of energy, industrial development, crop husb andry, or foreign trade. Many of the environment an d development problems that confront us have their ro ots in this sectoral fragmentation of responsibilit y. Sustainable development requires that such fragment ation be overcome. The issues that have been brought forward here, I t hink, are wide-ranging and maybe you know, maybe you don't know, the answers to all those issues. Bu t at least by hearing all those questions, stories, all these expressions that have been put forward, at le ast you could have some idea. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. You don't know the answers nor the solutions, but y ou could suggest the way to solve many problems and this is by suggesting either to governments, or the UN, or international agencies, to solve any proble m the best way: that is to include those with direct inte rests in it. The beneficiaries, as well as the vict ims of any development issue should be included, should be hea rd. I think that is the one thing, maybe that all of us are hearing here, or expecting: that in every deve lopment planning or development issue as much as possible t o listen and to include, to consult the people concerned. If that is taken care of, at least one s tep of the problem is resolved. Ismid Hadad Chief Editor, Prisma WCED Public Hearing Jakarta, 26 March 1985 76. Sustainability requires the enforcement of wide r responsibilities for the impacts of decisions. Th is requires changes in the legal and institutional fra meworks that will enforce the common interest. Some necessary changes in the legal framework start from the proposition that an environment adequate for health and well-being is essential for all human be ings including future generations. Such a view plac es the right to use public and private resources in it s proper social context and provides a goal for mor e specific measures. 77. The law alone cannot enforce the common interes t. It principally needs community knowledge and support, which entails greater public participation in the decisions that affect the environment. This is best secured by decentralizing the management of resourc es upon which local communities defend, and giving these communities an effective say over the use f these resources. It will also require promoti ng citizens' initiatives, empowering people's /13 78. Some large-scale projects, however, require par ticipation on a different basis. Public inquiries a nd hearings on the development and environment impacts can help greatly in drawing attention to different points of view. Free access to relevant information and the availability of alternative sources of tec hnical expertise can provide an informed basis for public discussion. When the environmental impact of a proposed project is particularly high, public scrut iny of the case should be mandatory and, wherever feasible, the decision should be subject to prior p ublic approval, perhaps by referendum. It has not been too difficult to push the environme nt lobby of the North and the development lobby of the South together. And there is now in fact a blurring of the distinction between the two, so they are co ming to have a common consensus around the theme of sust ainable development. The building blocks are there. Environmental concer n is common to both sides. Humanitarian concern is common to both sides. The difference lies in the me thods of each and the degree to which each side tri es to achieve its own economic interest through the de velopment assistance process. The time is right for bridging this gap for some ve ry pragmatic political reasons. First of all, the p eople of the North do not want to see their taxes wasted. Se condly, they do not want to see growing poverty, an d they obviously care for the environment, be it the environment of the North, where they live, or of th e South. And the majority of people in the South do n ot want short-term overpass solutions. In effect, there is a political community of intere st, North and South, in the concept of sustainable development that you can build upon. Richard Sandbrook International institute for Environment and Develop ment WCED Public Hearing Oslo, 24-25 June 1985 79. Changes are also required in the attitudes and procedures of both public and private-sector enterprises. Moreover, environmental regulation mus t move beyond the usual menu of safety regulations, zoning laws, and pollution control enactments; envi ronmental objectives must be built into taxation, p rior United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. approval procedures for investment and technology c hoice, foreign trade incentives, and all components of development policy. 80. The integration of economic and ecological fact ors into the law and into decision making systems within countries has to be matched at the internati onal level. The growth in fuel and material use dic tates that direct physical linkages between ecosystems of different countries will increase. Economic interactions through trade, finance, investment, an d travel will also grow and heighten economic and ecological interdependence. Hence in the future, ev en more so than now, sustainable development requires the unification of economics and ecology i n international relations, as discussed in the next chapter. IV. Conclusion 81. In its broadest sense, the strategy for sustain able development aims to promote harmony among human brings and between humanity and nature. In th e specific context of the development and environment crises of the 1980s, which current nati onal and international political and economic institutions have not and perhaps cannot overcome, the pursuit of sustainable development requires: a political system that secures effective citizen participation in decision making. an economic system that is able to generate surplu ses and technical knowledge on a self-reliant and sustained basis a social system that provides for solutions for th e tensions arising from disharmonious development. a production system that respects the obligation t o preserve the ecological base for development, a technological system that can search continuousl y for new solutions, an international system that fosters sustainable p atterns of trade and finance, and an administrative system that is flexible and has the capacity for self-correction. 82. These requirements are more in the nature of go als that should underlie national and international action on development.

A Sustainable World Economy United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 1. Through the ages, people have reached beyond the ir own borders to obtain essential, valued, or exot ic materials. Today's surer communications and larger trade and capital movements have greatly enlarged t his process, quickened its pace, and endowed it with fa r-reaching ecological implications. Thus the pursui t of sustainability requires major changes in internatio nal economic relations. I. The International Economy, the Environment, and Development 2. Two conditions must be satisfied before internat ional economic exchanges can become beneficial for all involved. The sustainability of ecosystems on which the global economy depends must be guaranteed. And the economic partners must be satisfied that the basis of exchange is equitable; relationships that are un equal and based on dominance of one kind or another are not a sound and durable basis for interdependence. For m any developing countries, neither condition is met. 3. Economic and ecological links between nations ha ve grown rapidly. This widens the impact of the gro wing inequalities in the economic development and streng th of nations. The asymmetry in international econo mic relations compounds the imbalance, as developing na tions are generally influenced by - but unable to i nfluence - international economic conditions. 4. International economic relationships pose a part icular problem for poor countries trying to manage their environments, since the export of natural resources remains a large factor in their economies, especia lly those of the least developed nations. The instability and adverse price trends faced by most of these countr ies make it impossible for them to manage their natural reso urce bases for sustained production. The rising bur den of debt servicing and the decline in new capital flows intensify those forces that lead to environmental deterioration and resource depletion occurring at t he expense of long-term development. 5. The trade in tropical timber, for example, is on e factor underlying tropical deforestation. Needs f or foreign exchange encourage many developing countries to cut timber faster than forests can be regenerated. Thi s overcutting not only depletes the resource that und erpins the world timber trade, it causes the lost o f forest- based livelihoods, increases soil erosion and downs tream flooding, and accelerates the loss of species and genetic resources. International trade patterns can also encourage the unsustainable development polic ies and practices that have steadily degraded the croplands and rangelands in the drylands of Asia and Africa; an example of that is provided by the growth of cotton production for export in the Sahel region. (See Bo x 3-1.) Box 3-1 Cotton Produced for Export in the Sahel In 1963-64, as drought and hunger were taking hold in the Sahel region of Africa, five Sahelian nation s - Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Niger, and Senegal - prod uced record amounts of cotton. They harvested 154 m illion tons of cotton fibre, up from 22.7 million tons in 1961-62. The Sahel as a whole set another record in 1984: It imported a record 1.77 million tons of cereals, up from 200,000 tons yearly in the early 1960s. Over t he period that Sahelian cotton harvests were steadily rising, world cotton prices were steadily falling in real terms. These figures do not suggest that Sahelian nations should plough up all cotton to plant sorghum and millet. But the fact that farmers who can grow cotton cannot grow e nough food to feed themselves suggests that cash cr ops are getting too much attention and food crops too l ittle. Source: J. Giri, 'Retrospective de l'Economie Sahel ienne', Club du Sahel, Paris, 1984. 6. Growth in many developing countries also require s external capital inflows. Without reasonable flow s, the prospect for any improvements in living standards i s bleak. As a result, the poor will be forced to ov eruse the environment to ensure their own survival. Long-term development thus becomes much harder, and in some cases impossible. Yet trends in the movement of cap ital are worrying. Net resource flows to developing countries have fallen in real terms; in aggregate, there is now actually an outflow. (See Table 3-1) T he increase of international capital flows to developing countr ies expected over the rest of the 1980s is only hal f that thought necessary to restore growth to levels where a reduction in poverty can occur. /1 United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 7. A mere increase in flows of capital to developin g countries will not necessarily contribute to deve lopment. Domestic efforts are of paramount importance. More external funding is also required, but it must come in ways that are sensitive to the environmental impacts. Th e point is that the reduction of poverty itself is a precondition for environmentally sound development. And resource flows from rich to poor flows improved both qualit atively and quantitatively are a precondition for the eradi cation of poverty.

II. Decline in the 1980s 8. The pressures of poverty and rising populations make it enormously difficult for developing countri es to pursue environmentally sound policies even in the b est of circumstances. But when international econom ic conditions are bad, the problems can become unmanag eable. During the 1980s, economic growth rates declined sharply or even turned negative in much of the Third World, particularly in Africa and Latin America. Over the five years from 1981 to 1985, population g rowth outstripped economic growth in most developin g countries. /2 9. Deteriorating terms of trade, rising debt servic e obligations, stagnating flows of aid, and growing protectionism in the developed market economies cau sed severe external payment problems. The increased cost of foreign borrowing, at a time when exports w ere depressed, also helped to plunge many developin g countries into debt crises. Austerity programmes la id down by the IMF as a prerequisite for extending credit to meet short-term balance-of-payments needs became pa rticularly onerous after the debt crisis. Growth wa s cut back and many social objectives fell by the wayside , including those having to do with employment, hea lth, education, environment, and human settlements. We know that the world lives through an internation al finance crisis, which increases the misery and t he poverty in the Third World arid we sacrifice even more our environment, though we know that this situation can be reversed, if we can use correctly new technology an d knowledge. But for this we have to find a new eth ic that will include the relationship between man and natur e above all. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. Sergio Dialetachi Speaker from the floor WCED Public Hearing Sao Paulo, 26-29 Oct 1985 10. This was a radical change from the 1960s and 19 70s. Then it was rapid economic growth that was see n as an ecological threat. Now it is recession, austerit y, and falling living standards. The decline of the 1980s has aggravated pressures on the environment in several ways: Austerity measures and general recessionary condit ions have brought sharp declines in per capita incomes and increased unemployment. This forces mor e people back into subsistence agriculture, where they draw heavily on the natural resource base and thus degrade it. Austerity programmes inevitably include government cutbacks in both the staff and expenditure of fledgling, weak environmental agencies, undermining even the minimal efforts being made to bring ecological considerations into development planning . Conservation always taken a back seat in times of economic stress. As economic conditions have worsened in developing countries and debt pressures have mounted, planners have tended to ignore environmental planning and conservation in both ind ustrial and rural development projects. 11. The critical situations in sub Saharan Africa a nd the debt strapped countries of Latin America dem onstrate, in an extreme way, the damaging impacts that unrefo rmed international economic arrangements are having on both development and the environment. 1. The African Continent 12. Africa on the whole has been caught up in a ser ies of downward spirals: poverty and hunger leading to environmental degrad ation, deteriorating agriculture, and hence more poverty and hunger; falling savings and a neglect of new investment in the wake of growing poverty; high infant mortality, poverty, and lack of educat ion; high population growth rates; and a flight from rural hunger to the cities, leading to explosive levels of urban growth and squalor, compounding the problems of inadequate food supplie s. 13. The situation is not everywhere so bleak. Some nations have coped well, and some far-reaching and courageous policy reforms begun in the last few yea rs have begun to bear fruit. Encouragement also com es from South Asia, where a comparable crisis 20 years ago has given way to an upward spiral of rising fo od production, diminishing (but still vast) poverty, s lowing population growth, rising savings and invest ment, and greater attention to the long-term questions of env ironmental management and appropriate technology. 14. Among the many causes of the African crisis, th e workings of the international economy stand out. Sub- Saharan Africa's economic well-being depends even m ore than low-income Asia's on developments in the world economy. Within the last decade, many sub-Sah aran countries have been hit by adverse trends in commodity terms of trade and external shocks such a s higher oil prices, fluctuating exchange rates, an d higher interest rates. Over the last 10 years, the prices of major commodities such as copper, iron ore, suga r, ground- nuts, rubber, timber, and cotton have fallen signif icantly. In 1985, the terms of trade of sub-Saharan countries (except oil-exporting countries) were 10 per cent b elow 1970 levels. In countries eligible for funds f rom the International Development Association (IDA), the av erage fall was well over 20 per cent, with even gre ater drops in some, including Ethiopia, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Zaire, and Zambia. /3 United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 15. The problem has been compounded by growing diff iculties in attracting development capital from the industrial world. At the same time, debt repayments and interest charges have risen Debt service rose in sub- Saharan Africa as a whole from 15 per cent of expor t earnings in 1980 to 31 per cent in 1985. /4 This combination of events has led to a situation where net resource transfers to the area fell from an est imated $10 billion a year in 1982 to $1 billion in 1985. /5 Thus nations have been able to import far less. In countries eligible for IDA loans, the import volume per person in 1984 was only 62 per cent of the volume in 1970. /6 Imports for agriculture - machinery, fertilizers, and pesticide s - and of essential supplies to meet basic needs h ave all been cut. The combination of diverse international and i nternal factors cut per capita incomes by 16 per ce nt in sub- Saharan Africa between 1960 and 1985. /7 16. The economic difficulties of sub-Saharan countr ies have had devastating social impacts. Declining per capita rood production has contributed to growing u ndernourishment. The recent drought placed some 35 million lives at risk in 1984/85, and as the drough t receded some 19 million people continued to suffe r famine. /8 Malnutrition and hunger have weakened much of the p opulation, reducing their productivity, and made mo re of them (especially children and the old) more suscept ible to debilitating diseases and premature death. The crisis has reversed progress in supplying safe drinking wa ter and sanitation. The seriousness of the African crisis cannot be ove remphasized and in its entirety, it should really e ngage the whole world. The lives of 400 million people living in Africa today are imperilled. And many more peop le yet to be born will face a very bleak future unless effect ive solutions are found and found quickly. It requires of course very little imagination to ap preciate the fact that it is not only Africa that i s in danger. In the long term the entire world economy could be threate ned not only because of the indivisibility of human welfare but because of Africa's crucial position in the glo bal economy as a source of a large number of vital raw materials. Maxime Ferrari Director, UNEP Regional Office for Africa WCED Public Hearing Harare, 18 Sept 1986 17. It is now more widely recognized that it is nec essary to deal with the long-term causes rather tha n the symptoms. The vast misery brought on by the drought in Africa is now generally acknowledged, and the w orld community has responded with a substantial emergenc y programme. But emergency food aid is only a short - term reaction, and, at best, a partial answer. The roots of the problem lie in national and internatio nal policies that have bo far prevented African economies from r ealizing their full potential for economic expansio n and thus for easing poverty and the environmental pressures that it generates. 18. The resolution lies in large part with African decision makers, but the international community al so has a heavy responsibility to support Africa's adjustment efforts with adequate aid and trade arrangements a nd to see to it that more capital flows into poorer nations t han out. These two complementary aspects of the res olution of the problems have been fully recognized by the Afri can countries themselves /9 and generally acknowledged by the international community. /10 The World Bank estimates that even if external eco nomic conditions are favourable over the next five years, and even if Af rican governments implement key policy reforms, a substantial gap will still remain between the finan ce or debt relief available on current donor polici es and the amounts needed to prevent a further deterioration i n the living standards of low-income Africa. /11 And there is no money in this grim equation for restoring the da maged environment. 19. The international community must realize that A frica cannot pull itself out of the planet's most s erious economic and ecological crisis without much more lo ng-term assistance than is currently envisioned. In addition, greatly increased external financing for development must be accompanied by policy changes t hat recognize the need to avoid environmental degradati on. 2. Latin American Debt 20. Debt is an acute problem for many countries of Africa. But, because of the magnitudes of debt invo lved, it has had its most visible impact in some middle-inco me countries - particularly in Latin America. The d ebt crisis remains a threat to international financial stabili ty, but its main impact so far has been on the proc ess of United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. development, both in its economic and ecological as pects. Of the total world debt of around $950 billi on in 1985, roughly 30 per cent was owed by four countrie s: Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and Venezuela. Their debts constitute roughly two-thirds of the outstanding lo ans of banks to developing countries. /12 21. In the 1970s, Latin America's economic growth w as facilitated by external borrowing. Commercial ba nks were happy to lend to growing countries rich in nat ural resources. Then major changes in international conditions made the debt unsustainable. A global re cession restricted export markets, and tight moneta ry policies forced up global interest rates to levels far exceeding any in living memory. Bankers, alarme d by deteriorating creditworthiness, stopped lending. A flight of indigenous capital from developing countr ies compounded the problem. 22. The ensuing crisis forced governments into aust erity policies to cut back imports. As a result, La tin American imports fell by 40 per cent in real terms over three years. /13 The consequent economic contraction reduced per capita gross domestic product by an ave rage of B per cent in the eight main Latin American countries. /14 Much of the burden was carried by the poor, as rea l wages fell and unemployment rose. Growing poverty and deteriorating environmental conditions are clearly visible in every major Latin American c ountry. 23. Further, the lack of new credit and the continu ing burden of debt service forced these countries t o service their debts by running trade surpluses. The net tra nsfers from seven major Latin American countries to creditors rose to almost $39 billion in 1984, and i n that year 35 per cent of export earnings went to pay interest on overseas debt. /15 This massive drain represents 5 to 6 per cent of t he region's GDP, around a third of the internal savings, and nearly 40 per cent of export earnings. It has been achieved by adjustment polici es that impose severe and regressively skewed cuts in wages , social services, investment, consumption, and employment, both public and private, further aggrav ating social inequity and widespread poverty. Press ures on the environment and resources have increased sharpl y in the search for new and expanded exports and replacements for imports, together with the deterio ration and overexploitation of the environment brou ght about by the swelling number of the urban and rural poor in desperate struggle for survival. A substantial p art of Latin America's rapid growth in exports are raw materials , food, and resource-based manufactures. The impact of the present crisis on Latin America h as been compared, in its depth and extension, with the Great Depression of 1929-32. The crisis has made it clear that, although the need to protect the envir onment against the traditional problems of deterioration a nd depletion continues to be a valid objective, pol icy-makers responsible for environmental management ought to a void negative attitudes in the face of the need for economic reactivation and growth. The expansion, conservation, maintenance, and prote ction of the environment can make an essential contribution to the improvement of the standard of living, to employment, and to productivity. Osvaldo Sunkel Coordinator, Joint ECLAC/UNEP Development and Envir onment Unit WCED Public Hearing Sao Paulo, 28-29 Oct 1985 24. So Latin American natural resources ate being u sed not for development or to raise living standard s, but to meet the financial requirements of industrialized c ountry creditors. This approach to the debt problem raises questions of economic, political, and environmental sustainability. To require relatively poor countri es to simultaneously curb their living standards, accept growing poverty, and export growing amounts of scar ce resources to maintain external creditworthiness ref lects priorities few democratically elected governm ents are likely to be able to tolerate for long. The present situation is not consistent with sustainable devel opment. This conflict is aggravated by the economic policies of some major industrial countries, which have depress ed and destabilized the international economy. In order to bring about socially and environmentally sustainab le development it is indispensable, among other elemen ts, for industrial countries to resume internationa lly expansionary policies of growth, trade, and investm ent. The Commission noted that, in these circumstan ces, some debtor countries have felt forced to suspend o r limit the outflow of funds. 25. Growing numbers of creditor banks and official agencies are realizing that many debtors simply wil l not be able to keep servicing their debts unless the burde n is eased. Measures under discussion include addit ional new lending, forgiveness of part of the debt, longe r-term rescheduling, and conversion to softer terms . But a United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. necessary sense of urgency is lacking. Any such mea sures must incorporate the legitimate interests of creditors and debtors and represent a fairer sharin g of the burden of resolving the debt crisis. III. Enabling Sustainable Development 26. Developing countries have sought, for many year s, fundamental changes in international economic arrangements so as to make them more equitable, par ticularly with regard to financial flows, trade, transnational investment, and technology transfer. /16 Their arguments must now be recast to reflect the ecological dimensions, frequently overlooked in the past. 27. In the short run, for most developing countries except the largest a new era of economic growth hi nges on effective and coordinated economic management among major industrial countries - designed to facilitat e expansion, to reduce real interest rates, and to ha lt the slide to protectionism. In the longer term, major changes are also required to make consumption and p roduction patterns sustainable in a context of high er global growth. 28. International cooperation to achieve the former is embryonic, and to achieve the latter, negligibl e. In practice, and in the absence of global management o f the economy or the environment, attention must be focused on the improvement of policies in areas whe re the scope for cooperation is already defined: ai d, trade, transnational corporations, and technology transfer . 1. Enhancing the Flow of Resources to Developing Co untries 29. Two interrelated concerns lie at the heart of o ur recommendations on financial flows: one concerns the quantity, the other the 'quality of resource flows to developing countries. The need for more resource s cannot be evaded. The idea that developing countries would do better to live within their limited means is a cruel illusion. Global poverty cannot be reduced by the g overnments of poor countries acting alone. At the s ame time, more aid and other forms of finance, while ne cessary, are not sufficient. Projects and programme s must be designed for sustainable development. 1.1 Increasing the Flow of Finance 30. As regards the quantity of resources, the strin gency of external finance has already contributed t o an unacceptable decline in living standards in develop ing countries. The patterns and the needs of the he avily indebted countries that rely mainly on commercial f inance have been described, along with those of low -income countries that depend on aid. But there are other p oor countries that have made impressive progress in recent years but still face immense problems, not least in countering environmental degradation. Low-income A sia has a continuing need for large amounts of aid; in gene ral, the main recipients in this region have a good record of aid management. Without such aid it will be much mo re difficult, to sustain the growth that, together with poverty-focused programmes, could improve the lot o f hundreds of millions of the 'absolute poor'. The universal importance of ecological problems can hardly be denied. Their successful solution will increasingly require coordinated activities not onl y within every country's economy but also within th e scope of international cooperation. Ecological problems are unprecedented in the history of mankind. Dr. Todor I. Bozninov Committee for Environment Protection, Bulgaria WCED Public Hearing Moscow, 8 Dec 1986 31. To meet such needs requires that the main donor s and lending institutions re-examine their policie s. Official development assistance (ODA) levels have stagnated in absolute terms, and most donor countries fall we ll short of internationally agreed targets. Commercial lending and lending by export credit agencies has fallen sharply. As part of a concerted effort to reverse t hese trends it is vitally important for development that there should be a substantial increase in resources avail able to the World Bank and IDA. Increased commercia l bank lending is also necessary for major debtors. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 1.2 Lending for Sustainable Development 32. In the past, development assistance has not alw ays contributed to sustainable development and in s ome cases detracted from it. Lending for agriculture, f orestry, fishing, and energy has usually been made on narrow economic criteria that take little account of envir onmental effects For instance, development agencies have sometimes promoted chemical-dependent agriculture, rather than sustainable, regenerative agriculture. It is important therefore that there should be a qualitat ive as well as a quantitative improvement. 33. A larger portion of total development assistanc e should go to investments needed to enhance the environment and the productivity of the resource se ctors. Such efforts include reforestation and fuelw ood development, watershed protection, soil conservatio n, agroforestry, rehabilitation of irrigation proje cts, small scale agriculture, low-cost sanitation measures, an d the conversion of crops into fuel. Experience has shown that the most effective efforts of this type are sm all projects with maximum grass-roots participation . The programmes most directly related to the objective o f sustainable development may therefore involve hig her local costs, a higher ratio of recurrent to capital costs, and a greater use of local technology and e xpertise. 34. A shift towards projects of this kind would als o require donors to re-examine the content of their aid programmes, particularly with regard to commodity a ssistance, which has sometimes served to reduce rat her than enhance the possibilities for sustainable deve lopment. (See Chapter 5 .) The industrialized world's demands for raw material s, higher productivity, and material goods have imp osed serious environmental impacts and high economic cos ts not only in our own countries, but also on the developing world. The existing international patter ns of financial, economic trade and investment poli cies further add to the problems. We must all be willing to examine our relations in international trade, investments, development assis tance, industry, and agriculture in light of the consequen ces these may have for underdevelopment and environ mental destruction in the Third World. We must even be wil ling to go further and implement the means necessar y to alienate these symptoms. Rakel Surlien Former Minister of Environment Government of Norway WCED Opening Ceremony Oslo, 24 June 1985 35. The major priority is for sustainability consid erations to be diffused throughout the work of inte rnational financial institutions. The roles of the World Bank and the IMF are particularly crucial because their lending conditions are being used as benchmarks for paralle l lending by other institutions - commercial banks and export credit agencies. It is important in this con text that sustainability considerations be taken in to account by the Bank in the appraisal of structural adjustment lending and other policy-oriented lending directed to resource-based sectors - agriculture, fishing, fore stry, and energy in particular - as well as specifi c projects. 36. A similar shift of emphasis is required in resp ect of adjustment programmes undertaken by developi ng countries. To date, 'adjustment' - particularly und er IMF auspices - has led more often than not to cu tbacks in living standards in the interest of financial stabi lization. Implicit in many suggested plans for copi ng with the debt crisis is the growing recognition that future adjustment should be growth-oriented. Yet it also n eeds to be environmentally sensitive. 37. The IMF also has a mandate for structural adjus tment lending, as in its new Structural Adjustment Facility. There has been a strongly expressed demand from dev eloping-country borrowers for the Fund to take into account wider and longer-term development objective s than financial stabilization: growth, social goal s, and environmental impacts. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 38. Development agencies, and the World Bank in par ticular, should develop easily usable methodologies to augment their own appraisal techniques and to assis t developing countries to improve their capacity fo r environmental assessment. 2. Linking Trade, Environment, and Development 39. The importance of foreign trade to national dev elopment has greatly increased for most countries i n the post-war period. (See Table 3-2.) This is one measu re of the extent to which trade has made nations, economically and ecologically, more interdependent. Patterns of world trade also have changed markedly . First, the value of trade in manufactured goods gre w at a faster rate than that in primary products ot her than fuel, and a growing number of developing countries have emerged as major exporters of such goods. Manufactured goods now account for twice the value of developing countries' non-oil exports. /17 (See Chapter 8.) Second, the industrialized market economies have come to depend more on fuel imports from developin g countries, which accounted for 43 per cent of consu mption in 1980-81 compared with only 16 per cent in 1959- 60 and even less in pre-war years. /18 40. The dependence of the developed market economie s on other mineral imports from the developing countries has also grown, and the share of these im ports in consumption increased from 19 per cent in 1959-60 to 30 per cent in 1980-81. /19 Non-renewable resources like fuels and minerals, a s well as manufactured goods, are now far more important than tropical products a nd other agricultural materials in the flow of prim ary products from developing to industrial countries. I n fact, the flow of food grains is in the opposite direction. 41. The main link between trade and sustainable dev elopment is the use of non-renewable raw materials to earn foreign exchange. Developing countries face th e dilemma of having to use commodities as exports, in order to break foreign exchange constraints on grow th, while also having to minimize damage to the environmental resource base supporting this growth. There are other links between trade and sustainabl e development; if protectionism raises barriers again st manufactured exports, for example, developing na tions have less scope for diversifying away from traditio nal commodities. And unsustainable development may arise not only from overuse of certain commodities but fr om manufactured goods that are potentially pollutin g. 2.1 International Commodity Trade 42. Although a growing number of developing countri es have diversified into manufactured exports, prim ary commodities other than petroleum continue to accoun t for more than one-third of the export earnings of the group as a whole. Dependence on such exports is par ticularly high in Latin America (52 per cent) and A frica (62 per cent). /20 The countries recognized as 'least developed' for the purposes of the UN Special Programme use primary commodities for 73 per cent of their ex port earnings. /21 43. Non-oil commodity prices fell during the early 1980s, not only in real but also in nominal terms. By early 1985, the UNCTAD commodity price index was 30 per c ent below the 1980 average. /22 This recent weakness of commodity prices may not be only a temporary phe nomenon. Commodity prices have not yet recovered fr om the depth of the world recession despite increased economic growth in consuming countries. The reasons may be partly technological (an acceleration in raw mat erial substitution); partly monetary, caused by the high cost of holding stocks of commodities; and partly due to increases in supplies by countries desperate to ea rn foreign exchange.

These countries are turning the terms of trade against themselves, earning less while exporting mo re. The promotion of increased volumes of commodity exports has led to cases of unsustainable overuse of the n atural resource base. While individual cases may not exact ly fit this generalization, it has been argued that such processes have been at work in ranching for beef, f ishing in both coastal and deep sea waters, forestr y, and the growing of some cash crops. Moreover, the price s of commodity exports do not fully reflect the environmental costs to the resource base. In a sens e, then, poor developing countries are being caused to subsidize the wealthier importers of their products . 45. The experience of oil has of course been differ ent from that of most other commodities. (See Chapter 7 .) It does provide one example of producers combining to restrict output and raise prices in ways that great ly increased export earnings while conserving the reso urce base and promoting energy saving and substitut ion on a large scale. Recent events suggest that regulatio n of the market by producers is very difficult in t he long term, whether or not it is desirable in the wider, global interest, and in any event the conditions have not existed for other commodity exporters to operate in a like mann er. Any arrangement encompassing measures to enhanc e the export earnings of producers, as well as to ens ure the resource basis, would require consumer as w ell as producer support. 46. In recent years, Third World commodity exporter s have sought to earn more by doing the first-stage processing of raw materials themselves. This first stage often involves subsidized energy, other conce ssions, and substantial pollution costs. But these countrie s often find that they do not gain much from this c apital- and energy-intensive first-stage processing, as the pri ce spread shifts in favour of downstream products, most of which continue to be manufactured mainly in industr ial countries. Tariff escalation in the industrial market economies reinforces this tendency. 47. The main international response to commodity pr oblems has been the development of international commodity agreements to stabilize and raise develop ing countries' earnings from these exports. But rea l progress has been very limited and in fact there ha ve been reversals. Moreover, environmental resource considerations have not played any part in commodit y agreements, with the notable exception of the International Tropical Timber Agreement. /23 48. Commodity agreements have not been easy to nego tiate, and regulation of commodity trade has been notoriously controversial and difficult. Current ar rangements could be improved in two crucial respect s: United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. Larger sums for compensatory financing to even out economic shocks - as under the IMF's Compensatory Financing Facility - would encourage p roducers to take a long-term view, and not to overproduce commodities where production is close t o the limits of environmental sustainability during periods of market glut. Where producers need to diversify from traditional , single-crop production patterns, more assistance could be given for diversification programmes. The second window of the Common Fund could be used for promoting resource regeneration and conservatio n. /24 49. Individual governments can better use renewable resources such as forests and fisheries to ensure that exploitation rates stay within the limits of sustai nable yields and that finances are available to reg enerate resources and deal with all linked environmental ef fects. As for non-renewable resources like minerals , governments should ensure that: the leaseholder undertakes exploration aimed at ad ding to proven reserves at least the amount extracted; that the ratio of production to proven reserve rem ains below a pre-specified limit; that the funds generated by royalties are used in a way that compensates for the declining income whe n the resource deposit is exhausted; and that the leaseholder is responsible for land resto ration and other environmental control measures in the urea affected by mining. I think it is also of importance for the Commission to note the problem of negotiation of contracts on resource development. We have been trying for 10 years to in clude provisions on environment. We have been successful only to get from the investors a very br oad description of what should be done in environme ntal protection. If you go into details you get problems with the lawyers and so on. That hampers then the investment. For us, of course, it is a choice of whether to loo sen the grip a little bit or if you maintain that, then of course, there will be no investment in the country. If an a ppeal could be made to the multinationals, mainly t o understand that what has been done in timber should also be applied to other agreements like coffee, t in, and others. I think this would be a great help. Speaker from the floor Government agency WCED Public Hearing Jakarta, 26 March 1985 50. Relevant international organizations such as va rious UN agencies, the World Bank, and regional gro ups could develop further their work on model contracts and guidelines incorporating these principles. 2.2 Protectionism and International Trade 51. The increase in protectionism in industrial cou ntries stifles export growth and prevents diversifi cation from traditional exports. The success of some Far Easter n developing countries in increasing exports of lab our- intensive manufactured goods shows the development potential of such trace. However, other countries - especially low-income Asian and Latin American nati ons - seeking to follow the same route have found themselves severely handicapped by growing trade ba rriers, particularly in textiles and clothing. If d eveloping countries are to reconcile a need for rapid export growth with a need to conserve the resource base, i t is imperative that they enjoy access to industrial cou ntry markets for non traditional exports where they enjoy a comparative advantage. In many cases, the problems of protectionism relate to manufactures; but there are cases - sugar is a good example - where industrial countries employ agricultural trade restrictions in ways that are damaging ecologically as well as economically. (See Box 3-2.) United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 2.3 'Pollution-intensive' Goods 52. The processing of certain raw materials - pulp and paper, oil, and alumina, for example - can have substantial environmental side effects. Industrial countries have generally been more successful than developing ones in seeing to it that export product prices reflect the costs of environmental damage a nd of controlling that damage. Thus in the case of export s from industrial countries, these costs are paid b y consumers in importing nations, including those in the Third World. But in the case of exports from de veloping countries, such costs continue to be borne entirely domestically, largely in the form of damage costs to human health, property, and ecosystems. Box 3-2 Sugar and Sustainable Development Thirty million poor people in the Third World depen d on sugar cane for their survival. Many developing countries have a genuine comparative advantage in p roduction and could earn valuable foreign exchange by expanding output. Some small states - Fiji, Mauriti us, and several Caribbean islands - depend for thei r economic survival on cane sugar exports. Industrial countries have actively promoted, and pr otected, beet sugar production, which competes with cane and has had quite damaging effects on developing co untries: High-cost, protected beet production encou rages artificial sweeteners; quotas have kept out Third W orld imports (except for some guaranteed imports as under the EEC's Sugar Protocol); and surpluses are dumped on world markets depressing prices. In the 1986 World Development Report, the World Ban k estimated that industrial countries' sugar polici es cost developing countries About $7.4 billion in lost rev enues during 1963, reduced their real income by abo ut $2.1 billion and increased price instability by about 25 per cent. Over and above the increased developing country pov erty that results from these practices, the promoti on of beet production in industrial countries has had adv erse ecological side effects. Modern beet growing i s highly capital-intensive, it depends heavily on chemical h erbicides, and the crop has poorer regenerative pro perties than others. The same product could be grown in dev eloping countries, as cane, more cheaply, using mor e labour and fewer chemical additives. 53. In 1980 the industries of developing countries exporting to OECD members would have incurred direc t pollution control costs of $5.5 billion if they had been required to meet the environmental standards then prevailing in the United States, according to a stu dy conducted for this Commission. /25 If the pollution control expenditures associated with the materials that wen t into the final product are also counted, the cost s would have mounted to $14.2 billion. The evidence also su ggests that OECD imports from developing countries involve products that entail higher average environ mental and resource damage costs than do overall OE CD imports. /26 These hypothetical pollution control costs probabl y understate the real costs of environmental and resource damage in the exporting countries. Further more, these costs relate only to environmental poll ution and net to the economic damage costs associated wit h resource depletion. 54. The fact that these costs remain hidden means t hat developing countries are able to attract more investment to export manufactured goods than they w ould under a more rigorous system of global environmental control. Many Third World policymaker s see this as beneficial in that it gives developin g countries a comparative advantage in 'pollution-int ensive' goods that should be exploited. They also s ee that passing along more of the real costs could reduce t he competitive position of their country in some ma rkets, and thus regard any pressure in this direction as a form of disguised protectionism from established p roducers. Yet it is in developing countries' own long-term in terests that more of the environmental and resource costs associated with production be reflected in prices. Such changes must come from the developing countrie s themselves.

Although a number of UNCTAD research projects h ave considered the links between trade and environment, these issues have not been taken up sy stematically by intergovernmental organizations. Th e mandates of these organizations - principally GATT and UNCTAD - should include sustainable development . Their activities should reflect concern with the im pacts of trading patterns on the environment and th e need for more effective instruments to integrate environment and development concerns into international tradin g arrangements. 56. International organizations dealing with trade will find it easier to reorientate their activities if each nation designates a lead agency with a broad mandate to as sess the effects of international trade on sustaini ng the environmental and resource base of economic growth. This agency could be responsible for raising sustainability issues in the work of UNCTAD, GATT, OECD, CMEA, and other relevant organizations. 3. Ensuring Responsibility in Transnational Investm ent 57. Overseas investment activity by companies in ma rket economies has grown substantially over the pas t 40 years. (See Box 3-3.) Foreign affiliates now accoun t for 40 per cent of sales, 33 per cent of net asse ts, and 56 per cent of net earnings for 380 of the largest ind ustrial corporations in the market economies, accor ding to data compiled by the UN Centre for Transnational Co rporations. /27 A high proportion of transnational investment is within industrial market economies, a nother aspect of the growing integration of these e conomies. 58. Transnationals play an important role as owners , as partners in joint ventures, and as suppliers o f technology in the mining and manufacturing sectors in many developing countries, especially in such environmentally sensitive areas as petroleum, chemi cals, metals, paper, and automobiles. They also dom inate world trade in many primary commodities. 59. In recent years, many developing countries have begun to take a more positive view of the role TNC investment can play in their development process. T his has been somewhat influenced by these countries ' needs for foreign exchange and their awareness of t he role that foreign investment might play in provi ding it. Effective cooperation with TNCs is possible in crea ting equal conditions for all parties. This can be attained by a strict observance of the principle of sovereignty o f the host country For their part, many corporation s have recognized the need to share managerial skills and technological know-how with host country nationals and to pursue profit-seeking objectives within a framework of long-tern sustainable development. Box 3-3 The Role of Transnational Corporations In 1983 chemicals accounted for roughly one-fourth of the stock of foreign direct investment in manufacturing in developing countries by companies from four leading countries - Japan (23 per cent), the United States (23 per cent), the United Kingdom (27 per cent), and the Federal Republic of Germany (14 per cent). Agriculture, mining, and other extractive industri es accounted for 38 per cent of the stock of U.S. investment in developing countries in 1983, 29 per cent of the stock of Japanese investment in 1983, 2 1 per cent of the total FRG investment in 1981-83, an d 9 per cent of the stock of U.K. investment in 197 8. Eighty to ninety per cent of the trade in tea, cof fee, cocoa, cotton, forest products, tobacco, jute, copper, iron ore, and bauxite is controlled in the case of each commodity by the three to six largest transnationals. Source: UN Centre on Transnational Corporations, En vironmental Aspects of the Activities of Transnatio nal Corporations: A Survey (New York: UN, 1985). 60. But mutual suspicions still exist, usually beca use of an asymmetry in bargaining power between lar ge corporations and small, poor, developing countries. Negotiations are often made one sided by a develop ing country's lack of information, technical unprepared ness, and political and institutional weaknesses. S uspicions United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. and disagreements remain, particularly concerning t he introduction of new technologies, the developmen t of natural resources, and the use of the environment. If multinationals are to play a larger role in deve lopment, these conflicts and suspicions must be reduced. 61. Strengthening the bargaining posture and respon se of developing countries vis a vis transnationals is therefore critical. Where nations lack indigenous c apacity to deal with large TNCs, regional and other international institutions should assist. As indica ted earlier, they could expand existing help in the form of model agreements with transnationals for different situat ions, such an lease agreements for the exploitation of a mineral resource. They could also field technical a ssistance and advisory teams when a country negotia tes with a transnational. 62. Transnational can have a substantial impact on the environment and resources of other countries an d on the global commons. Both the home and host countrie s of TNCs share responsibilities and should work together to strengthen policies in this sphere. For example, information on policies and standards app lied to and followed by corporations when investing in thei r own home country, especially concerning hazardous technologies, should be provided to host countries. Moreover, the policies of some industrialized coun tries that major investments are subject to prior environmenta l assessment should be considered for application t o investments made elsewhere and should be broadened to include sustainability criteria. The information and recommendations thus arrived at should be shared wi th the host countries, which of course would retain the final responsibility. 63. Despite their importance, international measure s regarding transnational have been generally lacki ng and have proved extremely difficult to negotiate. The c odes of conduct for transnational corporations form ulated by the OECD and under discussion in the UN should deal explicitly with environmental matters and the obje ctive of sustainable development. More detailed and speci fic instruments are needed for other problems. In particular, when introducing a new technology, plan t, product, or process, or when setting up a joint venture in a developing country, the parties involved must also recognize and accept certain special responsibiliti es. (See Chapter 8 .) 4. Broadening the Technological Base 64. The promotion of resource productivity is large ly the work of domestic economic policy. But the in ternational economy impinges on possibilities for productivity improvement in several ways, particularly in the tr ansfer of technology from one country to another. 4.1 The Diffusion of Environmentally Sound Technolo gies 65. The promotion of sustainable development will r equire an organized effort to develop and diffuse n ew technologies, such as for agricultural production, renewable energy systems, and pollution control. Mu ch of this effort will be based on the international exchange of technology: through trade in improved equipment, technology-transfer agreements, provision of expert s, research collaboration, and so on. Hence the pro cedures and policies that influence these exchanges must st imulate innovation and ensure ready and widespread access to environmentally sound technologies. 66. The real challenge is to ensure that the new te chnologies reach all those who need them, overcomin g such problems as the lack of information and in some cas es an inability to pay for commercially developed technologies. The measures required at the national level to deal with these problems are discussed in Part II of this report. However, both these issues also ari se in the international diffusion of technology. Transfer of technology should be also looked upon a s being a social process. Actually, ideally, it is the people themselves who have to make the selection, not us. So, to sum it up I think, talking about technology it is very important to, perhaps, understand that we are deali ng here with a process of change. Technologies cann ot be directly transferred except by relating this to a s ocial process. So, actually technology is not an in dependent variable in this case, but it is very much dependen t of social change. M. Nashihin Hasan Speaker from the floor United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. WCED Public Hearing Jakarta, 26 March 1985 67. Developing countries paid about $2 billion in 1 960 by way of royalties and fees, mainly to industr ial countries. /28 The gap in scientific and technological capabiliti es is particularly wide in areas of direct relevanc e to the objectives of sustainable development, inclu ding biotechnology and genetic engineering, new ene rgy sources, new materials and substitutes, and low-was te and non-polluting technologies. 68. The principal policy issue as regards the impac t of payments is the impact of patents and propriet ary rights. In 1980, industrialized market economies accounted for 65 per cent of the world total of patents grant ed, and the socialist countries of Eastern Europe held 29 p er cent. /29 Developing countries held only 6 per cent, and most of these had been granted to non-residents. Pr oprietary rights are a key element in the commercia l development of technology. But their application in certain areas may hamper the diffusion of environm entally sound technologies and may increase inequities. 69. In the past, publicly funded research provided new technology to small producers, particularly far mers, on a full or subsidized basis. The situation is not very different now, and in areas such as new seed varie ties there is some reason to believe proprietary rights could act as a major barrier to developing countries' acquis ition of new technologies. International cooperation is esse ntial to maintain the flow of genetic material and to ensure an equitable sharing of gains. 4.2 Building Up Technological Capabilities in Devel oping Countries 70. At present, most of the global research and dev elopment effort is devoted to military purposes or the commercial objectives of large corporations. Little of this is of direct relevance to conditions in de veloping countries. In many areas the gap in technological c apabilities is narrowing, but these efforts must be supported by international assistance, especially in such key areas as biotechnology. Unless action is taken to accumulate biological knowledge, valuable informati on as well as vital genetic variety will be lost fo rever, and developing countries will be at a permanent disadva ntage in adapting the new biotechnologies to their own needs. 71. Developing countries therefore have to work, in dividually and together, to build up their technolo gical capabilities. The creation and enhancement of the i nfrastructure for research and technology is a prec ondition for such cooperation. The countries concerned could share the burden by establishing cooperative resea rch projects along the lines of the International Agric ultural Research Centres. /30 Mission-oriented cooperative research ventures could be developed in areas such as dryland agriculture, tropical forestry, pollutio n control in small enterprises, and low-cost housing. Specific r esponsibilities would be assigned to institutions a nd corporations in the participating countries, and th e agreement could provide for the equitable sharing and widespread diffusion of the technologies developed. IV. A Sustainable World Economy 72. If large parts of the developing world are to a vert economic, social, and environmental catastroph es, it is essential that global economic growth be revitalize d. In practical terms, this means more rapid econom ic growth in both industrial and developing countries, freer market access for the products of developing countr ies, lower interest rates, greater technology transfer, and si gnificantly larger capital flows, both concessional and commercial. 73. But many people fear that a more rapidly growin g world economy will apply environmental pressures that are no more sustainable than the pressures presente d by growing poverty. The increased demand for ener gy and other non-renewable raw materials could signifi cantly raise the price of these items relative to o ther goods. 74. The Commission's overall assessment is that the international economy must speed up world growth w hile respecting the environmental constraints. Some favo urable trends have been noted in the pattern of consumption and production in industrial countries, which collectively still consume most of the world 's non- renewable resources. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 75. Sustaining these trends will make it easier for developing countries to grow by diversifying their own economies. But for them to emerge from dependence a general acceleration of global economic growth is not enough. This would mean a mere perpetuation of exis ting economic patterns, though perhaps at a higher level of incomes. It must be ensured that the economies o f developing countries grow fast enough to outpace their growing internal problems and fast enough for that first leap needed to acquire momentum. A continuati on of economic growth and diversification, along with the development of technological and managerial skills , will help developing countries mitigate the strains on t he rural environment, raise productivity and consum ption standards, and allow nations to move beyond depende nce on one or two primary products for their export earnings. 76. Future patterns of agricultural and forestry de velopment, energy use, industrialization, and human settlements can be made far less material-intensive (see Chapters 5, 7, 8, and 9), and hence both more economically and environmentally efficient. Under t hese conditions, a new era of growth in the world e conomy can widen the options available to developing count ries. 77. Reforms at an international level are now neede d to deal simultaneously with economic and ecologic al aspects in ways that allow the world economy to sti mulate the growth of developing countries while giv ing greater weight to environmental concerns. Such an a genda requires deep commitment by all countries to the satisfactory working of multilateral institutions, such as the multilateral development banks; to the making and observance of international rules in fields such as trade and investment; and to constructive dialogue on the many issues where national interests do not immedia tely coincide but where negotiation could help to r econcile them. 78. The Commission therefore regrets but cannot ign ore the recent decline in multilateral cooperation in general and a negative attitude to dialogue on deve lopment in particular. At first sight, the introduc tion of an environmental dimension further complicates the sea rch for such cooperation and dialogue. But it also injects an additional element of mutual self-interest, sinc e a failure to address the interaction between reso urce depletion and rising poverty will accelerate global ecological deterioration. 79. New dimensions of multilateralism are essential to human progress. The Commission feels confident that the mutual interests involved in environment and de velopment issues can help generate the needed momentum and can secure the necessary international economic changes that it will make possible.

In 1985. some 80 million people were added to a world population of 4.8 billion. Each year the numb er of human beings increases, but the amount of natural r esources with which to sustain this population, to improve the quality of human lives. and to eliminate mass p overty remains finite. On the other hand, expanding knowledge increases the productivity of resources. 2. Present rates of population growth cannot contin ue. They already compromise many governments' abili ties to provide education, health care, and food securit y for people, much less their abilities to raise li ving standards. This gap between numbers and resources i s all the more compelling because so much of the population growth is concentrated in low-income cou ntries, ecologically disadvantaged regions, and poo r households. 3. Yet the population issue is not solely about num bers. And poverty and resource degradation can exis t on thinly populated lands, such as the drylands and th e tropical forests. People are the ultimate resourc e. Improvements in education, health, and nutrition al low them to better use the resources they command, to stretch them further. In addition, threats to the s ustainable use of resources come as much from inequ alities in people's access to resources and from the ways in w hich they use them as from the sheer numbers of peo ple. Thus concern over the 'population problem' also cal ls forth concern for human progress and human equal ity. 4. Nor are population growth rates the challenge so lely of those nations with high rates of increase. An additional person in an industrial country consumer far more and places far greater pressure on natura l resources than an additional person in the Third Wo rld. Consumption patterns and preferences are as important as numbers of consumers in the conservati on of resources. 5. Thus many governments must work on several front s to limit population growth; to control the impact of such growth on resources and, with increasing knowledge, enlarge their range and improve their productivity ; to realize human potential so that people can better h usband and use resources; and to provide people wit h forms of social security other than large numbers of chil dren. The means of accomplishing these goals will v ary from country to country, but all should keep in mind tha t sustainable economic growth and equitable access to resources are two of the more certain routes toward s lower fertility rates. 6. Giving people the means to choose the size of th eir families is not just a method of keeping popula tion in balance with resources; it is a way of assuring - e specially for women the basic human right of self- determination. The extent to which facilities for e xercising such choices are made available is itself a measure of a nation's development. In the same way. enhanci ng human potential not only promotes development bu t helps to ensure the right of all to a full and dign ified life. I. The Links with Environment and Development 7. Population growth and development are linked in complex ways. Economic development generates resources that can be used to improve education and health. These improvements, along with associated social changes, reduce both fertility and mortality rates. On the other hand, high rates of population growth that eat into surpluses available for economic and socia l development can hinder improvements in education and health. 8. In the past, the intensification of agriculture and the production of higher yields helped nations cope with the increasing population pressures on available land. Migration and international trade in food and fuels eased the pressure on local resources. They permitted and hel ped sustain the high population densities of some industrialized countries. 9. The situation is different in most of the develo ping world. There, improvements in medicine and pub lic health have led to a sharp drop in mortality rates and hav e accelerated population growth rates to unpreceden ted levels. But fertility rates remain high; much human potential remains unrealized, and economic develop ment is stalled. Agricultural intensification can go some w ay towards restoring a balance between food product ion and population, but there are limits beyond which inten sification cannot go. (See Box 4-1.) 10. The very possibility of development can be comp romised by high population growth rates. Moreover, most developing countries do not have the resources to w ait for a few generations before population stabili zes. The option of migration to new lands is virtually close d. And low levels of economic and social developmen t United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. combined with changing trade production relationshi ps limit possibilities of using international trade to augment access to resources. Hence, in the absence of delib erate measures, the imbalance between population gr owth and resource development will worsen. 11. Population pressure is already forcing traditio nal farmers to work harder, often on shrinking fame on marginal land, just to maintain household income. I n Africa and Asia, rural population nearly doubled between 1950 and 1985, with a corresponding decline in land availability./ 1 Rapid population growth also creates urban economic and social problems that threaten to make cities wholly unmanageable. (See Chapter 9.) 12. Larger investments will be needed just to maint ain the current inadequate levels of access to educ ation, health care, and other services. In many cases, the resources required are just not available. Health, housing conditions, and the quality of education and public services all deteriorate; unemployment, urban drif t, and social unrest increase. Box 4-1 The Food/Population Balance The potential population-supporting capacity of la nd in developing countries has been assessed in a j oint study by FAO and the International Institute for Ap plied Systems Analysis. Data on soil and land characteristics were combined with climatic data to calculate the potential yields of major crops, to select the optimum crops, and to derive the overall potent ial for calorie production. Three levels of crop production were calculated: the first at a low leve l of technology with no fertilizer or chemicals, tr aditional crop varieties, and no soil conservation; the secon d at an intermediate level, where the most producti ve crop mix is used on half the land along with fertil izers, improved varieties, and some soil conservati on; and the third at a high level of technology with an ideal crop mix and technology on all lands. The population-supporting capacity was determined by di viding the total calorie production by a minimum pe r capita intake level. This figure was then compared with the medium-variant UN population projections. The 117 developing countries covered in the study, taken together, can produce enough food to feed one-and-a-half times their projected population in the year 2000. even at a low level of technology. B ut the picture is less hopeful in the cases of individ ual countries. At the low level of technology, 64 c ountries with a population of around 1.1 billion lack the re sources to feed themselves. With the most advanced agricultural methods, the number of countries where food production potential would fall short of requirements drops to 19, with a total population o f 100 million. Most are high-income West Asian countries and some small island states. Many of the se countries have the capacity to earn enough foreign exchange to import their food requirements. In the others, the real issue is the modernization of agriculture on a sustainable basis. Some researchers have assessed the 'theoretical' p otential for global food production. One study assumes that the area under food production can be around 1.5 billion hectares (close to the current level) and that average yields could go up to 5 ton s of grain equivalent per hectare (as against the present average of 2 tons of grain equivalent}. All owing for production from rangelands and marine sources, the total 'potential' is placed at 8 billi on tons of grain equivalent. How many people can this sustain? The present glob al average consumption of plant energy for food, seed, and animal feed amounts to about 6,000 calori es daily, with a range among countries of 3,000- 15,000 calories, depending on the level of meat con sumption. On this basis, the potential production could sustain a little more than 11 billion people. But if the average consumption rises substantially - say, to 9,000 calories - the population carrying capacit y of the Earth comes down to 7.5 billion. These fig ures could be substantially higher if the area under foo d production and the productivity of 3 billion hect ares of permanent pastures ran be increased on a sustainabl e basis. Nevertheless, the data do suggest, that meeting the food needs of an ultimate world populat ion of around 10 billion would require tone changes in food habits, as well as greatly improving the ef ficiency of traditional agriculture.

Industrial countries seriously concerned with h igh population growth rates in other parts of the w orld have obligations beyond simply supplying aid packages of family planning hardware. Economic development, through its indirect impact on social and cultural factors, lowers fertility rates. International poli cies that interfere with economic development thus interfere with a dev eloping nation's ability to manage its population g rowth. A concern for population growth must therefore be a p art of a broader concern for a more rapid rate of e conomic and social development in the developing countries. 14. In the final analysis, and in both the develope d and developing worlds, the population issue is ab out humane and not about numbers. It is misleading and an injustice to the human condition to see people m erely fit; consumers. Their well being and security old a ge security, declining child mortality, health care , and so on are the goal o( development Almost any activity tha t increases well-being and security lessens peoples ' desires to have more children than they and national ecosys tems can support. II. The Population Perspective 1. Growth in Numbers 15. Population growth accelerated in the middle of the 18th century with the advent of the Industrial Revolution and associated improvements in agriculture, not jus t in the regions that are more developed but elsewh ere as well. The recent phase of deceleration started arou nd 1950 with the sharp reduction in mortality rates in the developing countries. Since 1970 it has been fashionable to draw a distin ction between population and environment as two cri sis areas, but often times we forget that population is in fact a very integral part of the environment an d therefore when we are addressing ourselves to population we a re looking at not only the physical, biological, an d chemical environments, we are also looking at the s ocio-cultural or socio-economic environment in whic h these development programmes are being set. And populatio n makes much more sense if you are talking of population within a context. Dr. J.O. Oucho Population Studies and Research institute WCED Public Hearing Nairobi. 23 Sept 1986 16. Between 1950 and 1985. world population grew at an annual rate of 1.9 per cent, compared with 0.8 per cent in the half-century preceding 1950./ 2 population growth is now concentrated in the devel oping regions of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, which accounted fo r 85 per cent of the increase of global population since 1950. (See Table 4-1.) 17. The processes of population growth are changing in most developing countries as birth and death ra tes fall. In the early 1950s, practically all developing coun tries had birth rates over 40 and death rates over 20, the major exception being the low death rates in Latin America. (These rates refer to the annual number of births and deaths per 1,000 population.) Today the situati on is quite different: Thirty-two per cent of the people in the Third Wor ld live in countries - such as China and the Republ ic of Korea - with birth rates below 25 and death rates b elow 10. Forty-one per cent are in countries where birth ra tes have fallen, but not as much as death rates, an d their populations are growing at around 2 per cent - doubling, in other words, every 34 years. Such countries include Brazil, India, Indonesia, and Mex ico. The remaining 27 per cent live in countries, such as Algeria, Bangladesh. Iran, and Nigeria, where de ath rates have fallen slightly but birth rates remain h igh. Overall population growth is in the range of 2 .5 to 3 per cent (doubling every 28 to 23 years), with even higher growth rates in some countries, such as Kenya./ 3 United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 18. In the industrial world, fertility rates have d eclined and the population is not growing rapidly. In fact, it has stabilized in many countries. Still, the population in North America, Europe, the USSR, and Oceania is expected to increase by 230 million by the year 202 5. which is as many people as live in the United St ates today.

The acceleration of population growth in the Th ird World and the decline in fertility levels in in dustrial countries are (changing age distribution patterns r adically. In developing countries, the young predom inate. In 1900, 39 per cent of developing country populations were younger than 15; the figure for industrialize d countries was only 23 per cent./ 4 Yet in these countries, the proportion of the elde rly is growing. Those 65 or older accounted for 11 per cent of the population i n 1980; in developing countries, they represented o nly 4 per cent./ 5 Thus in the industrial world, relatively fewer peo ple of working age will bear the burden of supporti ng relatively larger numbers of older people. 20. A changing age structure helps to set patterns of future population growth. The large number of yo ung people in developing countries means large numbers of future parents, so that even if each person prod uces fewer children. The total number of births will con tinue to increase. Population growth can continue t o grow for some decades after fertility rates decline to the ' replacement level' of slightly over two children on average per couple. Thus in many nations, high population growt h over the next few generations are assured. 21. Population projections indicate an increase in global population from 4.8 billion in 1985 to 6.1 b illion by 2000, and to 8.2 billion by 2025. (See Table 4 2.) More than 90 pet cent of this increase is expected in developing regions. Large differences exist among c ountries in these areas, and the momentum of popula tion growth is higher in Africa than in Latin America or Asia. In some developing countries, such as China, population growth rates are already well below 2 pe r cent and are expected to fall below 1 per cent by the beginning of the next century./ 6 United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 22. Reflecting the 'momentum' of population growth, long term UN projections show that at the global l evel: if replacement-level fertility is reached in 2010, global population will stabilize at 7.7 billion by 2060; if this rate is reached in 2025, population will s tabilize at 10.2 billion by 2095; if. however, the rate is reached only in 2065, glo bal population in 2100 would be 14.2 billion./ 7 23. These projections show that the world has real choices. Policies to bring down fertility rates cou ld make a difference of billions to the global population nex t century. The greater part of the differences betw een the three variants is accounted for by South Asia. Africa, an d Latin America. Hence much depends on the effectiv eness of population policies in these regions. 2. Changes in Mobility 24. The number of people in Europe, Japan. North Am erica. and the Soviet Union quintupled between 1750 and 1950. and these regions' share in world populat ion increased sharply over thin period./ 8 By the latter part of the 19th century, there was growing concern abou t population pressures in Europe. Migration to Nort h America, Australia, and New Zealand helped to some extent. At its peak between 1881 and 1910, permanen t emigration absorbed nearly 20 per rent of the incre ase in population in Europe./ 9 25. Today, however, migration in not a major factor in determining population distribution among count ries. Between 1970 and 1980 permanent emigration as a per centage of population increase fell to 4 per cent i n Europe and was only 2.5 per cent in Latin America. The corresponding percentages in Asia and Africa we re very much lower./ 10 Thus the option of emigration to new lands has not been and will not be a significant element in relieving demographic pressures in devel oping countries In effect, this reduces the time av ailable to bring population into balance with resources. 26. Within countries, populations are more mobile. Improved communications have enabled large movement s of people. Sometimes as a natural response to the g rowth of economic opportunities in different places . Some governments have actively encouraged migration from densely to sparsely settled areas. A more recent phenomenon is the flight of 'ecological refugees' f rom areas of environmental degradation.

Much of the movement is from countryside to cit y. (See Chapter 9.) In 1985. some 40 per cent of th e world's population lived in cities; the magnitude o f the urban drift can be seen in the fact that sinc e 1950, the increase in urban population has been larger than t he increase in rural population both in percentage and in absolute terms. This shift is most striking in deve loping countries, where the number of city-dwellers quadrupled during this period./ 11 3. Improved Health and Education 28. Improvements in the health and education of all , but especially of women and in conjunction with o ther social changes that raise the status of women, can have a profound effect in bringing down population growth rates. In an initial period, however, better health care means that more babies live to reproduce and that women reproduce over longer time spans. Table 4-3 Health Indicators Life Expectancy at Birth Infant Mortality Rates 1950-55 1980-85 1960-65 1980-85 Region (years) (deaths per 1,000 live births) World 49.9 64.6 117 81 Africa 37.5 49.7 157 114 Asia 41.2 57.9 133 87 South America 52.3 64.0 101 64 North America 64.4 71.1 43 27 Europe 65.3 73.2 37 16 USSR 61.7 70.9 32 25 Oceania 61.0 67.6 55 39 Source: WCED, based on data in World Resources Inst itute / International Institute for Environment and Development, World Resources 1986 (New York: Basic Books, 1986). 29. The 'health status' of a society is a complex c oncept that cannot be measured easily. Two widely a vailable indicators that reflect at least some aspects of a given society's health are life expectancy and infa nt mortality rates. (See Table 4-3.) These statistics suggest th at health has improved virtually everywhere; and, a t least with regard to these two indicators, the gap betwee n industrial and developing regions has narrowed. 30. Many factors can increase life expectancy and r educe mortality rates: two are worth emphasizing. F irst, although generally speaking national wealth buys na tional health, some relatively poor nations and are as, such as China, Sri Lanka, and the Indian state of Kerala , have achieved remarkable success in lowering infa nt mortality and improving health through increases in education, especially of women; the establishment of primary health clinics; and other health care progr ammes./ 12 Second, the principal reductions in mortality rate s in the industrial world came about before the adven t of modern drugs; they were due to improved nutrit ion, housing, and hygiene. The recent gains in developin g countries have also been largely due to public he alth programmes, particularly for the control of communi cable diseases. 31. Education is another key dimension of 'populati on quality'. The past few decades have seen a great expansion of educational facilities in virtually al l countries. In terms of school enrolment, literacy rates, the growth in technical education, and the development of scientific skills, much progress has been achiev ed. (See Table 4-4.) III. A Policy Framework 32. Excessive population growth diffuses the fruits of development over increasing numbers instead of improving living standards in many developing count ries: a reduction of current growth rates is an imp erative for sustainable development. The critical issues are th e balance between population size and available res ources and the rate of population growth in relation to th e capacity of the economy to provide for the basic needs of the United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. population, not just today but for generations. Suc h a long-term view is necessary because attitudes t o fertility rarely change rapidly and because, even after ferti lity starts declining, past increases in population impart a momentum of growth as people reach child-bearing ag e. However a nation proceeds towards the goals of sustainable development and lower fertility levels, the two are intimately linked and mutually reinfor cing. 33. Measures to influence population size cannot be effective in isolation from other environment/deve lopment issues. The number, density, movement, and growth r ate of a population cannot be influenced in the sho rt run if these efforts are being overwhelmed by adverse patt erns of development in other areas. Population poli cies must have a broader focus than controlling numbers: Measures to improve the quality of human resources in terms of health, education, and social development are as important. 34. A first step may be for governments to abandon the false division between 'productive' or 'economi c' expenditures and 'social' expenditures. Policymaker s must realize that spending on population activiti es and on other efforts to raise human potential is crucial t o a nation's economic and productive activities and to achieving sustainable human progress - the end for which a go vernment exists. 1. Managing Population Growth 35. Progress in population policies is uneven. Some countries with serious population problems have comprehensive policies. Some go no further than the promotion of family planning. Some do not do even that. 36. A population policy should set out and pursue b road national demographic goals in relation to othe r socio- economic objectives. Social and cultural factors do minate all others in affecting fertility. The most important of these is the roles women play in the family, the ec onomy, and the society at large Fertility rates fal l as women's employment opportunities outside the home and farm, their access to education, and their age at marria ge all rise. Hence policies meant to lower fertility rates not only must include economic incentives and disi ncentives, but must aim to improve the position of women in so ciety. Such policies should essentially promote wom en's rights.

Poverty breeds high rates of population growth: Families poor in income, employment, and social se curity need children first to work and later to sustain el derly parents. Measures to provide an adequate live lihood for poor households, to establish and enforce minimum-a ge child labour laws, and to provide publicly finan ced social security will all lower fertility rates. Imp roved public health and child nutrition programmes that bring down infant mortality rates - so parents do not need 'ex tra' children as insurance against child death - ca n also help to reduce fertility levels. The environment is the business of everybody, devel opment is the business of everybody, life and livin g is the business of everybody. I think the solution will be found in encouraging mass environmental literacy s o that there can be democratic and literate decisions, bec ause if decisions are taken by a few without the incorporation of the opinion of the masses, the NGO s especially included, the likelihood is that the s ituations will not succeed. They will be imposed from above, the people will not respond positively to them, and the project is lost before it is launched. Joseph Ouma Dean of School of Environmental Studies, Moi Univer sity WCED Public Hearing Nairobi, 23 Sept 1986 38. All these programmes are effective in bringing down birth rates only when their benefits are share d by the majority. Societies that attempt to spread the bene fits of economic growth to a wider segment of the p opulation may do better at lowering birth rates than societie s with both faster and higher levels of economic gr owth but a less even sharing of the benefits of that growth. 39. Thus developing-country population strategies m ust deal not only with the population variable as s uch but also with the underlying social and economic condit ions of underdevelopment. They must be multifaceted campaigns: to strengthen social, cultural, and econ omic motivations for couples to have small families and. through family planning programmes, to provide to a ll who want them the education, technological means , and services required to control family size. 40. Family planning services in many developing cou ntries suffer by being isolated from other programm es that reduce fertility and even from those that increase motivation to use such services. They remain separa te both in design and implementation from such fertility-re lated programmes as nutrition, public health, mothe r and United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. child care, and preschool education that take place in the same area and that are often funded by the same agency. 41. Such services must therefore be integrated with other efforts to improve access to health care and education. The clinical support needed for most mod ern contraceptive methods makes family planning ser vices heavily dependent on the health system. Some govern ments have successfully combined population programme: with health, education, and rural develo pment projects, and implemented them as part of maj or socio-economic programmes in villages or regions. T his integration increases motivation, improves acce ss, and raises the effectiveness of investments in family p lanning. 42. Only about 1.5 per cent of official development aid now goes for population assistance./ 13 Regrettably, some donor countries have cut back on their assista nce for multilateral population programmes and so weakened them; this must be reversed. 43. Zimbabwe is one nation that has successfully in tegrated its family planning efforts not only with its rural health services but also with efforts to improve wo men's abilities to organize group activities and ea rn money through their own labour. The government's initial efforts were aimed less at limiting population grow th than at assisting women to space births in the interests of mother and child health and at helping infertile w omen to bear children. But gradually families have begun to use the contraceptives made available for child sp acing as a way to limit fertility. Zimbabwe now leads sub-Sa haran Africa in the use of modern contraceptive met hods./ 14 2. Managing Distribution and Mobility 44. Population distribution across a country's diff erent regions is influenced by the geographical spr ead of economic activity and opportunity. Most countries a re committed in theory to balancing regional develo pment, but are rarely able to do this in practice. Governm ents able to spread employment opportunities throug hout their nations and especially through their countrys ides will thus limit the rapid and often uncontroll ed growth of one or two cities. China's effort to support villag e-level industries in the countryside is perhaps th e most ambitious of this sort of national programme. 45. Migration from countryside to city is not in it self a bad thing; it is part of the process of econ omic development and diversification. The issue is not s o much the overall rural urban shift but the distri bution of urban growth between large metropolitan cities and smaller urban settlements. (See Chapter 9.) 46. A commitment to rural development implies more attention to realizing the development potential of all regions, particularly those that are ecologically d isadvantaged (See Chapter 6.) This would help reduc e migration from these areas due to lack of opportuni ties. But governments should avoid going too far in the opposite direction, encouraging people to cove into sparsely populated areas such as tropical moist fo rests, where the land may not be able to provide sustainab le livelihoods. Demographic phenomena constitute the heart of the A frican Development problematique. They are the data that lead most analysts to project a continuing and deepening crisis in Africa. There is no doubt of t he imperative and urgent need for a far reaching popul ation policy to be adopted and vigorously implement ed by African governments. One issue of relevance that requires further resear ch is the use of the tax system as a means for cont rolling population growth and discouraging rural-urban migr ation. To slow down population growth, should families wit hout children be given a tax incentive or tax break ? Should a tax penalty be imposed for each child after a fix ed number of children, considering that the tax sys tem has not solved the population migration problem?

From Liability to Asset 47. When a population exceeds the carrying capacity of the available resources, it can become a liabil ity in efforts to improve people's welfare. But talking of population just as numbers glosses over an importa nt point: People are also a creative resource, and this creat ivity is an asset societies must tap. To nurture an d enhance that asset, people's physical well-being must be im proved through better nutrition, health care, and s o on. And education must be provided to help them become more capable and creative, skilful, productive, and bet ter able to deal with day-to-day problems. All this has to be achieved through access to and participation in the processes of sustainable development. 3.1 Improving Health We in Asia, I feel, want to have an equilibrium bet ween the spiritual and material life. I noticed tha t you have tried to separate religion from the technological s ide of life. Is that not exactly, the mistake in th e West in developing technology, without ethics, without reli gion? If that is the case, and we have the chance t o develop a new direction, should we not advise the group on te chnology to pursue a different kind of technology w hich has as its base not only the rationality, but also the spiritual aspect? Is this a dream or is this someth ing we cannot avoid? Speaker from the floor WCED Public Hearing Jakarta, 26 March 1985 48. Good health is the foundation of human welfare and productivity. Hence a broad-based health policy is essential for sustainable development. In the devel oping world, the critical problems of ill health ar e closely related to environmental conditions and development problems. 49. Malaria is the most important parasitic disease in the tropics, and its prevalence is closely rela ted to wastewater disposal and drainage. Large dams and ir rigation systems have led to sharp increases in the incidence of schistosomiasis (snail fever) in many areas. Inadequacies in water supply and sanitation are direct causes of other widespread and debilitating disease s such as diarrhoeas and various worm infestations. 50. Though much has been achieved in recent years, 1.7 billion people lack access to clean water, and 1.2 billion to adequate sanitation./ 15 Many diseases can be controlled not just through t herapeutic interventions but also through improvements in rural water supply, sa nitation, and health education. In this sense, they really require a developmental solution. In the developing world, the number of water taps nearby is a better indication of the health of a community than is the number of hospital beds. 51. Other examples of links between development, en vironmental conditions, and health include air poll ution and the respiratory illnesses it brings, the impact of housing conditions on the spread of tuberculosi s, the effects of carcinogens and toxic substances, and th e exposure to hazards in the workplace and elsewher e. 52. Many health problems arise from the nutritional deficiencies that occur in virtually all developin g countries, but most acutely in low-income areas. Most malnutri tion is related to a shortage of calories or protei n or both, but some diets also lack specific elements and comp ounds, such as iron and iodine. Health will be grea tly improved in low-income areas by policies that lead to the production of more of the cheap foods the po or traditionally eat - coarse grains and root crops. 53. These health, nutrition, environment, and devel opment links imply that health policy cannot be con ceived of purely in terms of curative or preventive medicine, or even in terms of greater attention to public he alth. Integrated approaches are needed that reflect key h ealth objectives in areas such as food production; water supply and sanitation: industrial policy, particula rly with regard to safety and pollution; and the pl anning of human settlements. Beyond this, it is necessary to identify vulnerable groups and their health risks a nd to ensure that the socio-economic factors that underli e these risks are taken into account in other areas of development policy. 54. Hence. WHO's 'Health for All' strategy should b e broadened far beyond the provision of medical wor kers and clinics, to cover health-related interventions in all development activities./ 16 Moreover, this broader approach must be reflected in institutional arrange ments to coordinate all such activities effectively . United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 55. Within the narrower area of health care, provid ing primary health care facilities and making sure that everyone has the opportunity to use them are approp riate starting points. Maternal and child health ca re are also particularly important. The critical elements here are relatively inexpensive and can have a prof ound impact on health and well-being. An organized syste m of trained birth attendants, protection against t etanus and other childbirth infections, and supplemental f eeding can dramatically reduce maternal mortality. Similarly, low-cost programmes to assure immunization, teach a nd supply oral dehydration therapy against diarrhoe as, and encourage breast-feeding (which in turn can red uce fertility) can increase child survival rates dr amatically. 56. Health care must be supplemented by effective h ealth education. Some parts of the Third World may soon face growing numbers of the illnesses associated wi th life-styles in industrial nations - cancer and h eart disease especially. Few developing nations can afford the e xpensive treatment required for the latter diseases , and should begin efforts now to educate their citizens on the dangers of smoking and of high-fat diets. 57. A rapid spread of acquired immune deficiency sy ndrome (AIDS) in both developed and developing nati ons could drastically alter all countries' health prior ities. AIDS is threatening to kill millions of peop le and disrupt the economies of many countries. Governments should ove rcome any lingering shyness and rapidly educate the ir people about this syndrome and about the ways in wh ich it is spread. International cooperation on rese arch and the handling of the disease is essential. 58. Another major health problem with international ramifications is the increase in drug addiction. I t is a problem closely linked to organized crime in the pr oduction of drugs, in large-scale international tra ffic in these drugs, and in the networks for distribution. It dis torts the economy in many poor producing areas and destroys people the world over. International cooperation is essential in tackling this scourge. Some countries have to deploy considerable financial resources to halt the production and traffic in narcotics and to promote crop diversification and rehabilitation schemes in the p roducing areas, which are generally impoverished. T o sustain their efforts, greater international assistance is essential 59. Most medical research focuses on pharmaceutical s, vaccines. and other technological interventions for disease management. Much of this research is direct ed at the diseases of industrialized countries, as their treatment accounts for a substantial part of the sa les of pharmaceutical companies. More research is u rgently needed on the environmentally related tropical dise ases that are the major health problem in the Third World, This research should focus not merely on new medici nes, but also on public health measures to control these diseases. Existing arrangements for international c ollaboration on tropical disease research should be greatly strengthened. Education and communication are vitally important i n order to impress each individual of his or her responsibility regarding the healthy future of the earth. The best way for students to recognize that their action can make a difference is to have projects organized by the school or community on which the students c an work. Once convinced that they can help, people ten d to change both their attitude and their behaviour . New attitudes towards the environment will be reflected in decisions at home and in corporate boardrooms a round the world. Bernice Goldsmith Student, North Toronto Collegiate WCED Public Hearing Ottawa, 26-27 May 1986 3.2 Broadening Education 60. Human resource development demands knowledge an d skills to help people improve their economic performance. Sustainable development requires chang es in values and attitudes towards environment and development - indeed, towards society and work at h ome, on farms, and in factories. The world's religi ons could help provide direction and motivation in form ing new values that would stress individual and joi nt responsibility towards the environment and towards nurturing harmony between humanity and environment. 61. Education should also be geared towards making people more capable of dealing with problems of overcrowding and excessive population densities, an d better able to improve what could be called 'soci al carrying capacities'. This is essential to prevent ruptures in the social fabric, and schooling should enhance the United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. levels of tolerance and empathy required for living in a crowded world. Improved health, lower fertili ty, and better nutrition will depend on greater literacy an d social and civic responsibility. Education can in duce all these, and can enhance a society's ability to overc ome poverty, increase incomes, improve health and n utrition, and reduce family size. 62. The investment in education and the growth in s chool enrolment during the past few decades are sig ns of progress. Access to education is increasing and wil l continue to do so. Today almost all the world's b oys are getting some form of primary education. In Asia and Africa, however, enrolment rates for girls are muc h lower than for boys at all levels. A large gap also exist s between developed and developing countries in enr olment rates beyond primary schools, as Table 4-4 indicate d. 63. UN projections of enrolment rates for the year 2000 suggest a continuation of these trends. Thus d espite the growth in primary education, illiteracy will co ntinue to rise in terms of sheer numbers: there wil l be more than 900 million people unable to read and write at the end of the century. By then, girls' enrolment rates are still expected to be below the current rates for bo ys in Asia. As for secondary education, developing countries are not expected to attain even the 1960 industrial country levels by the year 2000./ 17 64. Sustainable development requires that these tre nds be corrected. The main task of education policy must be to make literacy universal and to close the gaps between male and female enrolment rates. Realizing these goals would improve individual productivity and ear nings, as well as personal attitudes to health, nut rition, and child-bearing. It can also instill a greater awaren ess of everyday environmental factors. Facilities f or education beyond primary school must be expanded to improve s kills necessary for pursuing sustainable developmen t. 65. A major problem confronting many countries is t he widespread unemployment and the unrest that it l eads to. Education has often been unable to provide the skills needed for appropriate employment. This is e vident in the large numbers of unemployed people who have bee n trained for white-collar employment in swelling u rban populations. Education and training should also be directed towards the acquisition of practical and v ocational skills, and particularly towards making people more self-reliant. All this should be supported by effo rts to nurture the informal sector and the participation of commun ity organizations. 66. Providing facilities is only the beginning. Edu cation must be improved in quality and in relevance to local conditions. In many areas, it should be integrated with children's participation in farm work, a proce ss requiring flexibility in the school system. It should impart knowledge relevant for the proper management of loc al resources. Rural schools must teach about local soi ls, water, and the conservation of both, about defo restation and how the community and the individual can revers e it. Teachers must be trained and the curriculum developed so that students learn about the agricult ural balance sheet of an area. 67. Most people base their understanding of environ mental processes and development on traditional bel iefs or on information provided by a conventional education . Many thus remain ignorant about ways in which the y could improve traditional production practices and better protect the natural resource base. Education should therefore provide comprehensive knowledge, encompas sing and cutting across the social and natural scie nces and the humanities, thus providing insights on the interaction between natural and human resources, be tween development and environment. 68. Environmental education should be included in a nd should run throughout the other disciplines of t he formal education curriculum at all levels - to foster a se nse of responsibility for the state of the environm ent and to teach students how to monitor, protect, and improve it. These objectives cannot be achieved without th e involvement of students in the movement for a bette r environment, through such things as nature clubs and special interest groups. Adult education, on-the-jo b training, television, and other less formal metho ds must be used to reach out to as wide a group of individuals as possible, as environmental issues and knowledge systems now change radically in the space of a life time. 69. A critical point of intervention is during teac her training. The attitudes of teachers will be key in increasing understanding of the environment and its. links wit h development. To enhance the awareness and capabil ities of teachers in this area, multilateral and bilatera l agencies must provide support for the relevant cu rriculum development in teacher training institutions, for t he preparation of teaching aids, and for other simi lar activities. Global awareness could be fostered by encouraging c ontacts among teachers from different countries, fo r instance in specialized centres set up for this pur pose.

I am here as the son of a small nation, the Krenak Indian Nation. We live in the valley of the Rio Doc e. which is the frontier of Espirito Santo with the State of Mi nas Gerais. We are a micro-country - a micro-nation . When the government took our land in the valley of Rio Doce, they wanted to give us another place some where else. But the State, the government will never unde rstand that we do not have another place to go. The only possible place for the Krenak people to li ve and to re-establish our existence, to speak to o ur Gods, to speak to our nature, to weave our lives is where ou r God created us. It is useless for the government to put us in a very beautiful place, in a very good place wit h a lot of hunting and a lot of fish. The Krenak pe ople, we continue dying and we die insisting that there is o nly one place for us to live. My heart does not become happy to see humanity's in capacity. I have no pleasure at all to come here an d make these statements. We can no longer see the pla net that we live upon as if it were a chess-board w here people just move things around. We cannot consider the planet as something isolated from the cosmic. We are not idiots to believe that there is possibil ity of life for us outside of where the origin of o ur life is. Respect our place of living, do not degrade our living cond ition, respect this life. We have no arms to cause pressure, the only thing we have is the right to cry for our dignity and the need to live in our land. Ailton Krenak Coordinator of Indian Nations Union WCED Public Hearing Sao Paulo. 28-29 Oct 1985 3.3 Empowering Vulnerable Groups 70. The processes of development generally lead to the gradual integration of local communities into a larger social and economic framework. But some communities - so-called indigenous or tribal peoples - remain isolated because of such factors as physical barrie rs to communication or marked differences in social and cultural practices. Such groups are found in North America, in Australia, in the Amazon Basin, in Cent ral America, in the forests and hills of Asia, in the d eserts of North Africa, and elsewhere. 71. The isolation of many such people has meant the preservation of a traditional way of life in close harmony with the natural environment. Their very survival h as depended on their ecological awareness and adapt ation. But their isolation has also meant that few of them have shared in national economic and social develo pment; this may be reflected in their poor health, nutriti on, and education. 72. With the gradual advance of organized developme nt into remote regions, these groups are becoming l ess isolated. Many live in areas rich in valuable natur al resources that planners and 'developers' want to exploit, and this exploitation disrupts the local environmen t so as to endanger traditional ways of life. The l egal and institutional changes that accompany organized deve lopment add to such pressures. 73. Growing interaction with the larger world is in creasing the vulnerability of these groups, since t hey are often left out of the processes of economic development. Social discrimination, cultural barriers, and the e xclusion of these people from national political processes make s these groups vulnerable and subject to exploitati on. Many groups become dispossessed and marginalized, and th eir traditional practices disappear. They become th e victims of what could be described as cultural exti nction. 74. These communities are the repositories of vast accumulations of traditional knowledge and experien ce that links humanity with its ancient origins. Their disa ppearance is a loss for the larger society, which c ould learn a great deal from their traditional skills in sustain ably managing very complex ecological systems. It i s a terrible irony that as formal development reaches more deepl y into rain forests, deserts, and other isolated environments, it tends to destroy the only cultures that have proved able to thrive in these environme nts. 75. The starting point for a just and humane policy for such groups is the recognition and protection of their traditional rights to land and the other resources that sustain their way of life - rights they may de fine in terms that do not fit into standard legal systems. These groups' own institutions to regulate rights and obl igations are crucial for maintaining the harmony with nature and the environmental awareness characteristic of the United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. traditional way of life. Hence the recognition of t raditional rights must go hand in hand with measure s to protect the local institutions that enforce responsibility in resource use. And this recognition must also giv e local communities a decisive voice in the decisions about resource use in their area. 76. Protection of traditional rights should be acco mpanied by positive measures to enhance the well-be ing of the community in ways appropriate to the group's li fe-style. For example, earnings from traditional ac tivities can be increased through the introduction of marketing arrangements that ensure a fair price for produce, but also through steps to conserve and enhance the resource base and increase resource productivity. 77. Those promoting policies that have an impact on the lives of an isolated, traditional people must tread a fine line between keeping them in artificial, perhaps un wanted isolation and wantonly destroying their life -styles. Hence broader measures of human resource developmen t are essential. Health facilities must be provided to supplement and improve traditional practices; nutri tional deficiencies have to be corrected, and educa tional institutions established. These steps should preced e new projects that open up an area to economic development. Special efforts should also be made to ensure that the local community can derive the ful l benefit of such projects, particularly through jobs. 78. In terms of sheer numbers, these isolated, vuln erable groups are small. But their marginalization is a symptom of a style of development that tends to neg lect both human and environmental considerations. H ence a more careful and sensitive consideration of their interests is a touchstone of a sustainable develop ment policy.

Food for the Future Footnotes United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 1. The world produces more food per head of populat ion today than ever before in human history. In 198 5, it produced nearly 500 kilogrammes per head of cereals and root crops, the primary sources of food./ 1 Yet amid this abundance, more than 730 million people did no t eat enough to lead fully productive working lives ./ 2 There are places where too little is grown; there are pla ces where large numbers cannot afford to buy food. And there are broad areas of the Earth, in both industrial an d developing nations, where increases in food produ ction are undermining the base for future production. 2. The agricultural resources and the technology ne eded to feed growing populations are available. Muc h has been achieved over the past few decades. Agricultur e does not lack resources; it lacks policies to ens ure that the food is produced where it is needed and in a ma nner that sustains the livelihoods of the rural poo r. He can meet this challenge by building on our achievements and devising new strategies for sustaining food an d livelihood security. I. Achievements 3. Between 1950 and 1985, cereal production outstri pped population growth, increasing from around 700 million tons to over 1,800 million tons, an annual growth rate of around 2.7 per cent./ 3 This increase helped to meet escalating demands for cereals caused by popul ation growth and rising incomes in developing count ries and by growing needs for animal feed in developed c ountries. Yet regional differences in performance h ave been large. (See Table 5-1.) 4. As production has increased sharply in some regi ons and demand in others, the pattern of world trad e in foods, especially cereals, has changed radically. N orth America exported barely 5 million tons of food grains yearly before the Second World War; it exported nea rly 120 million tons during the 1980s. Europe's gra in deficit is very much lower now. and the bulk of North Ameri can exports are to the USSR. Asia, and Africa. Thre e countries - China, Japan, and the USSR - took half the world exports in the early 1980s; much of the r est went to relatively wealthy developing countries, such as Middle Eastern oil exporters. Several poor agricul tural countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, have b ecome net importers of foodgrains. Still, although one-fourth of sub-Saharan Africa's population relied on import ed grains in 1984, that region's imports have accou nted for less than 10 per cent of world grain trade thus far in the 1980s./ 4 Table 5-1 Two Decades of Agricultural Development Per Capita Food Production (Index 1961-64 = 100) Per Capita Gross Cropped Area (Hectares) Per Hectare Fertilizer use (kg.) 1961-64 1981-84 1964 1984 1964 1984 World 100 112 0.44 0.31 29.3 85.3 North America 100 121 1.05 0.90 47.3 93.2 Western Europe 100 131 0.11 0.25 114.4 124.1 Eastern Europe and USSR 100 128 0.84 0.71 30.4 122.1 Africa 100 88 0.74 0.35 1.8 9.7 Near East* 100 107 0.53 0.35 6.9 53.6 Far East** 100 116 0.10 0.20 4.4 45.4 United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology.

Demand fo r milk and meat is growing as incomes rise in societies th at prefer animal protein. and much agricultural dev elopment in the industrialized nations has been devoted to m eeting these demands. In Europe, meat production mo re than tripled between 1950 and 1984, and milk produc tion nearly doubled./ 5 Meat production for exports increased sharply, particularly in the rangelands o f Latin America and Africa. World meat exports have risen from around 2 million tons in 1950-52 to over 11 mi llion tons in 1984./ 6 6. To produce this milk and meat required in 1984 a bout 1.4 billion cattle and buffaloes, 1.6 billion sheep and goats, 800 million pigs, and a great deal of poultr y - all of which weigh more than the people on the planet./ 7 Most of these animals graze or browse or are fed lo cal plants collected for them. However, rising dema nds for livestock feedgrains led to sharp increases in the production of cereals such as corn, which accounted for nearly two-thirds of the total increase in grain pr oduction in North America and Europe between 1950 a nd 1985. 7. This unprecedented growth in food production has been achieved partly by an extension of the produc tion base: larger cropped areas, more livestock, more fi shing vessels, and so on. But most of it is due to a phenomenal rise in productivity. Population increas es have meant a decline in the area of cropped land in most of the world in per capita terms. And as the availa bility of arable land has declined, planners and fa rmers have focused on increasing productivity. In the past 35 years this has been achieved by: using new seed varieties designed to maximize yiel ds, facilitate multiple cropping, and resist diseas e; applying more chemical fertilizers, the consumptio n of which rose more than ninefold/ 8; using more pesticides and similar chemicals, the u se of which increased thirty-two-fold/ 9; and increasing irrigated area, which more than doubled ./ 10 8. Global statistics mask substantial regional diff erences. (See Box 5-1.) The impacts of new technolo gy have been uneven, and in some respects the agricultural technology gap has widened. For instance, average A frican foodgrain productivity declined in relation to Euro pean productivity from roughly one-half to about on e-fifth over the past 35 years. Even in Asia, where new technolo gy has spread rapidly, productivity in relation to European levels dropped./ 11 Similar 'technology gaps' have emerged between reg ions within countries. 9. The past few decades have seen the emergence of three broad types of food production systems, 'Indu strial agriculture', capital- and input-intensive and usua lly large-scale, is dominant in North America, West ern and Eastern Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and in s ome small areas in developing countries. 'Green Revolution agriculture' is found in uniform, resour ce-rich, often flat and irrigated areas in the agri cultural heartlands of some developing countries. It is more widespread in Asia but is also found in parts of L atin America and North Africa. Though initially the new technologies may have favoured large farmers, they are today accessible to a growing number of small produ cers. 'Resource-poor agriculture' relies on uncerta in rain rather than irrigation and is usually found in deve loping regions difficult to farm - drylands, highla nds, and forests - with fragile soils. This includes most of sub-Saharan Africa and the remoter areas of Asia a nd Latin America. Here, per capita production has been decli ning and hunger is a critical problem. But today, a ll three systems of food production display signs of crises that endanger their growth.

II. Signs of Crisis 10. Agricultural policies in practically all countr ies have focused on output growth. Despite this, it has proved far more difficult to raise world agricultural output b y a consistent 3 per cent a year in the mid-1980s t han it was in the mid-1950s. Moreover, production records have be en offset by the appearance Box 5-1 Regional Perspectives on Agricultural Devel opment Africa a drop in per capita food output of about 1 per ce nt a year since the beginning of the 1970s a focus on cash crops and a growing dependence on imported food, fostered by pricing policies and for eign exchange compulsions major gaps in infrastructure for research, extensi on, input supply, and marketing degradation of the agricultural resource base due to desertification, droughts, and other processes large untapped potential of arable land, irrigatio n, and fertilizer use West Asia and North Africa improvements in productivity due to better irrigat ion, the cultivation of high-yielding varieties, an d higher fertilizer use limited arable land and considerable amounts of de sert, making food self-sufficiency a challenge a need for controlled irrigation to cope with dry conditions South and East Asia increased production and productivity, with some c ountries registering grain surpluses rapid growth in fertilizer use in some countries a nd extensive development of irrigation government commitments to be self-reliant in food, leading to national research centres, development of high-yielding seeds, and the fostering of location- specific technologies little unused land, and extensive, unabated defore station growing numbers of rural landless Latin America declining food imports since 1980, as food product ion kept pace with population growth over the last decade government support in the form of research centres to develop high-yielding seeds and other technolog ies inequitable distribution of land deforestation and degradation of the agricultural resource base, fueled partly by foreign trade and d ebt crisis a huge land resource and high productivity potenti al, though most of the potentially arable land is i n the remote, lightly populated Amazon Basin, where perha ps only 20 per cent of the land is suitable for sustainable agriculture North America and Western Europe North America the world's leading source of surplu s foodgrain, though the rate of increase in output per hectare and in total productivity slowed in the 197 0s United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. subsidies for production that are ecologically and economically expensive depressing effect of surpluses on world markets an d consequent impact on developing countries a resource base increasingly degraded through eros ion, acidification, and water contamination in North America, some scope for future agricultur al expansion in frontier areas that can be intensiv ely farmed only at high cost Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union food deficits met through imports, with the Soviet Union being the world's largest grain importer increased government investment in agriculture acc ompanied by eased farm distribution and organizatio n to meet desires for food self-reliance, leading to production increases in meat and root crops pressures on agricultural resources through soil e rosion. acidification, salinization, alkalization, and water contamination of linked economic and ecological cri ses: Industrialized countries are finding it increa singly difficult to manage their surplus food production, the livelihood base of millions of poor producers i n developing countries is deteriorating, and the reso urce base for agriculture is under pressure virtual ly everywhere. 1. Impact of Subsidies 11. The food surpluses in North America and Europe result mainly from subsidies and other incentives t hat stimulate production even in the absence of demand. Direct or indirect subsidies, which now cover virt ually the entire food cycle, have become extremely expensive. In the United States, the cost of farm support has grown from $2.7 billion in 1980 to $25.8 billion in 1986. In the EEC, such costs have risen from $6.2 billio n in 1976 to $21.5 billion in 1986./ 12 12. It has become politically more attractive, and usually cheaper, to export surpluses - often as foo d aid - rather than to store them. These heavily subsidized surpluses depress the international market prices of commodities such as sugar and have created severe p roblems for several developing countries whose economies are based on agriculture. Non-emergency f ood aid and low-priced imports also keep down price s received by Third World farmers and reduce the ince ntive to improve domestic food production. 13. The environmental consequences of a heavily sub sidized production system are becoming evident with in industrialized nations/ 13 ; lower productivity as soil quality declines due to intensive soil cultivation and overuse of chemical fertilizers and pesticides/ 14 ; the destruction of the countryside, through cleari ng of hedgerows, park: belts, and other protective cover and the levelling, occupation, and cultivatio n of marginal land and watershed protection areas; and nitrate pollution of ground-water aquifers due to the often subsidized overuse of nitrate fertilizers , 14. The financial, economic, and environmental effe cts of the current incentive systems are beginning to be questioned by many governments and groups, includin g farm organizations. A particular area of concern is the impact of these policies on developing countries. T hey depress international prices of products, such as rice and sugar, that are important exports for many deve loping countries and so reduce exchange earnings of developing countries. They increase the instability of world prices. And they discourage the processin g of agricultural commodities in the producing countries ./ 15 15. It is in the interests of all, including the fa rmers, that the policies be changed. Indeed, in rec ent years some conservation-oriented changes have taken place and some subsidy systems have increasingly stressed the need to retire land from production. The financial and economic burden of subsidies must be reduced. T he United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. harm that these policies do to the agriculture of d eveloping countries by disrupting world markets mus t be eliminated. 2. Neglect of the Small Producer 16. The new technology behind increases in agricult ural productivity requires scientific and technolog ical skills, a system for technology extension and other service s for farmers, and commercial orientation in farm management. In many' parts of Asia, in particular, small farmers have shown a remarkable capacity to u se new technology once they are given incentives and adequ ate financial and infrastructural support. Small ca sh-crop farmers in Africa have demonstrated the potential o f the smallholder on that continent, and in the las t few years successes have been recorded in food crops also. Bu t ecologically disadvantaged areas and land-poor ru ral masses have not benefited from advances in technolo gy and will not until governments are willing and a ble to redistribute land and resources, and give them the necessary support and incentives. 17. Agricultural support systems seldom take into a ccount the special circumstances of subsistence far mers and herders. subsistence farmers cannot afford the high cash outlay of modern inputs. Many are shiftin g cultivators who do not have a clear title to the la nd they use. They may plant a variety of crops on o ne plot to meet their own needs, and are thus unable to use me thods developed for large stands of a single crop. 18. Many herders are nomadic and difficult to reach with education, advice, and equipment. They, like subsistence farmers, depend on certain traditional rights, which are threatened by commercial developm ents. They herd traditional breeds, which are hardy but r arely highly productive. 19. Women farmers, though they play a critical role in food production, are often ignored by programme s meant to improve production. In Latin America, the Caribb ean, and Asia they form a large agricultural labour force, while most of sub-Saharan Africa's food is grown by women. Yet almost all agricultural programmes tend to neglect the special needs of women farmers. I think that at a forum like this there always tend s to be someone standing up and saying you forgot m y issue. I think my serious sensitivity to women!s role vis-a- vis the environment. Especially in Africa, I think it has been clearly s tated over and again that women are responsible for between 60 to 90 per cent of the food production, processing, and marketing. No one can really address the food c risis in Africa or many of the other crises that seem to exi st here without addressing the question of women, a nd really seeing that women are participants in decision-maki ng processes at the very basic all the way through up the highest level. Mrs. King The Greenbelt Movement WCED Public Hearing Nairobi. 23 Sept 1986 3. Degradation of the Resource Base 20. Short-sighted policies are leading to degradati on of the agricultural resource base on almost ever y continent: soil erosion in North America: soil acid ification in Europe; deforestation and desertificat ion in Asia. Africa, and Latin America; and waste and pollution of water almost everywhere. Within 40-70 years, glo bal warming may cause the flooding of important coastal production areas. Some of these effects arise from trends in energy use and industrial production. Some arise from the pressure of population on limited resourc es. But agricultural policies emphasizing increased product ion at the expense of environmental considerations have also contributed greatly to this deterioration. 3.1 Loss of Soil Resources 21. Increases in cropped areas in recent decades ha ve often extended cultivation in marginal lands pro ne to erosion. By the late 1970s, soil erosion exceeded s oil formation on about a third of U.S. cropland, mu ch of it in the midwestern agricultural heartland./ 16 In Canada, soil degradation has been costing farme rs $1 billion a year./ 17 In the USSR, the extension of cultivation to the s o-called Virgin Lands was a major plank of agricult ural policy, but now it is believed that much of this la nd is marginal./ 18 In India, soil erosion affects 25-30 per cent of United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. the total land under cultivation./ 19 Without conservation measures, the total area of r ainfed cropland in developing countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin Ame rica would shrink by 544 million hectares over the long term because of soil erosion and degradation, according to an FAO study./ 20 22. Erosion makes soil less able to retain water, d epletes it of nutrients, and reduces the depth avai lable for the roots to take hold. Land productivity declines. Ero ded topsoil is carried to rivers. lakes, and reserv oirs, silts up ports and waterways, reduces reservoir storage capa city, and increases the incidence and severity of f loods. 23. Poorly designed and implemented irrigation syst ems have caused waterlogging, salinization, and alkalization of soils. FAO and UNESCO estimate that as much as half the world's irrigation schemes suf fer in some degree from these problems./ 21 These estimates indicate that some 10 million hect ares of irrigated land are being abandoned each year. 24. Soil degradation erodes the overall resource ba se for agriculture. The loss of croplands encourage s farmers to overuse the remaining land and to move i nto forests and onto rangelands. Sustainable agricu lture cannot be based on methods that mine and deplete th e soil, 3.2 Impact of Chemicals 25. Chemical fertilizers and pesticides have played a large role in production increases since the Sec ond World War, but clear warnings have been raised against ov er-reliance on them. The run-off of nitrogen and phosphates from excess use of fertilizers damages w ater resources, and such damage is spreading. 26. Using chemicals to control insects, pests, weed s, and fungi enhances productivity, but overuse thr eatens the health of humans and the lives of other species . Continuing, long-term exposure to pesticide and c hemical residues in food, water, and even in the air is haz ardous, particularly to children. A 1983 study esti mated that approximately 10.000 people died each year in devel oping countries from pesticide poisoning and about 400,000 suffered acutely./ 22 The effects are not limited to the area where pest icides are used but travel through the food chain. 27. Commercial fisheries have been depleted, bird s pecies endangered, and insects that prey on pests w iped out. The number of pesticide-resistant insect pest species worldwide has increased and many resist eve n the newest chemicals. The variety and severity of pest infestations multiply, threatening the productivity of agriculture in the areas concerned. 28, The use of agricultural chemicals is not in its elf harmful. In fact, the level of use is still qui te low in many regions. In these areas, response rates are high an d the environmental consequences of residues are no t yet a problem. Hence these regions would benefit by using more agrochemicals. However, the growth in the use of chemicals tends to be concentrated precisely where they may be doing more overall harm than good. 3.3 Pressure on Forests 29. Forests are crucial for maintaining and improvi ng the productivity of agricultural land. Yet agric ultural expansion, a growing world timber trade, and woodfu el demand have destroyed much forest cover. Althoug h this destruction has occurred worldwide, today the greatest challenge is in developing countries, part icularly in tropical forests. (See Chapter 6.) 30. Growing populations and the decreasing availabi lity of arable land lead poor farmers in these coun tries to seek new land in forests to grow more food. Some go vernment policies encourage the conversion of fores ts to pastures and others encourage large resettlement sc hemes in forests. There is nothing inherently wrong with clearing forests for farming, provided that the lan d is the best there is for new farming, can support the numbers encouraged to settle upon it, and is not already se rving a more useful function, such as watershed pro tection. But often forests are cleared without forethought o r planning. 31. Deforestation most severely disrupts mountainou s areas and upland watersheds and the ecosystems th at depend on them. The uplands influence precipitation , and the state of their soil and vegetation system s influence how this precipitation is released into t he streams and rivers and onto the croplands of the plains United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. below. The growing numbers and growing severity of both floods and droughts in many parts of the world have been linked to the deforestation of upland watershe ds./ 23 3.4 Advancing Deserts 32. Some 29 per cent of the earth's land area suffe rs slight, moderate, or severe desertification; an additional 6 per cent is classified as extremely severely desert ified./ 24 In 1984, the world's drylands supported some 850 million people, of whom 230 million were on lands a ffected by severe desertification./ 25 33. The process of desertification affects almost e very region of the globe, but it is most destructiv e in the drylands of South America, Asia, and Africa; for th ese three areas combined. 18.5 per cent (870 millio n hectares) of productive lands are severely desertif ied. Of the drylands in developing countries. Afric a's Sudano- Sahelian zones and, to a lesser extent, some countr ies south of this zone suffer the most. In their ar id and semi-arid lands are to be found 80 per cent of the moderately affected and 85 per cent of the severely affected people./ 26 34. Land permanently degraded to desert-like condit ions continues to grow at an annual rate of 6 milli on hectares./ 27 Each year. 21 million additional hectares provide no economic return because of the spread of desertification./ 28 These trends are expected to continue despite some local improvements. 35, Desertification is caused by a complex mix of c limatic and human effects. The human effects, over which we have more control, include the rapid growth of b oth human and animal populations, detrimental land use practices (especially deforestation), adverse terms of trade, and civil strife. The cultivation of cas h crops on unsuitable rangelands has forced herders and their cattle onto marginal lands. The unfavourable intern ational terms of trade for primary products and the policie s of aid donors have reinforced pressures to encour age increasing cash-crop production at any cost. 36. A Plan of Action conceived by UNEP and drawn up at the 1977 UN Conference on Desertification has l ed to some slight, mainly local gains./ 29 Progress on the plan has been hampered by lack of financial support from the international community, by inadequacies of the regional organizations established to respond to t he regional nature of the problem, and by the lack of involvement of grass-roots communities. Small farmers are held responsible for environmenta l destruction as if they had a choice of resources to depend on for their livelihood, when they really do n't. In the context of basic survival, today's need s tend to overshadow consideration for the environmental futu re. It is poverty that is responsible for the destr uction of natural resources, not the poor. Geoffrey Bruce Canadian International Development Agency WCED Public Hearing Ottawa, 26/27 May 1986 III. The Challenge 37. Food demand will increase as populations increa se and their consumption patterns change. In the remaining years of this century, about 1.3 billion people will be added to the human family (see Chapt er 4); rising incomes, however, may account for 30 to 40 p er cent of the increased demand for food in develop ing countries and about 10 per cent in industrial natio ns./ 30 Thus over the next few decades, the global food system must be managed to increase food production by 3 to 4 per cent yearly. 38. Global food security depends not only on raisin g global production, but on reducing distortions in the structure of the world food market and on shifting the focus of food production to food-deficit countr ies, regions, and households. Many of the countries not growing e nough food to feed themselves possess the largest remaining reservoirs of untapped agricultural resou rces. Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa have muc h unused land. although its quality and quantity vary greatly from nation to nation and much of it is ec ologically vulnerable./ 31 The Soviet Union and parts of North America have s ignificant amounts of frontier land suitable for agriculture; only Asia and Europe are truly lan d-starved. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 39. Global food security also depends on ensuring t hat all people, even the poorest of the poor, can g et food. While on the world scale this challenge requires a reappraisal of global food distribution, the task w eighs more immediately and heavily on national governments. In equitable distribution of production assets, unempl oyment, and underemployment are at the heart of the problem of hunger in many countries. 40. Rapid, sound agricultural development will mean not only more food but more opportunities for peop le to earn money to purchase food. Thus when countries wi th untapped agricultural resources provide food by importing more, they are effectively importing unem ployment. By the same token, countries that are sub sidizing food exports are increasing unemployment in food-im porting countries. This marginalizes people, and marginalized people are forced to destroy the resou rce base to survive. Shifting production to food-de ficit countries and to the resource-poor farmers within t hose countries is a way of securing sustainable liv elihoods. 41. Conserving the agricultural resource base and l ivelihood security of the poor can be mutually supp ortive in three ways. First, secure resources and adequate li velihoods lead to good husbandry and sustainable management. Second, they ease rural-to-urban migrat ion, stimulate agricultural production from resourc es that otherwise would be underused, and reduce the need f or food to be produced elsewhere. Third, by combati ng poverty, they help to slow population growth. 42. Shifting the focus of production to food-defici t countries will also reduce pressures on agricultu ral resources in the industrialized market economies, enabling th em to move towards more sustainable agricultural pr actices. Incentive structures can be changed so that instead of encouraging overproduction, they encourage farm practices that improve soil and water quality. Gove rnment budgets will be relieved of the burdens of s toring and exporting surplus products. 43. This shift in agricultural production will be s ustainable only if the resource base is secure. As indicated, this is far from the case today. Thus to achieve global food security, the resource base for food productio n must be sustained, enhanced, and, where it has been diminis hed or destroyed, restored. There are many contradictions in agricultural devel opment. The blind imitation of models developed und er different circumstances will have to give way to th e realities and conditions existing in Africa. Larg e areas of virgin land have been opened up for export crops wh ose prices keeps declining. This is not in the inte rest of developing countries. There are so many problems to be overcome that we f orget that every problem is an opportunity to do something positive. This is an opportunity for us t o think of conservation and environment in a broad educational context. In doing so, we will be able t o capture the next generation and demonstrate the w onder and the benefits of the world around them. Adolfo Mascarenhas IUCN Harare Office WCED Public Hearing Harare. 18 Sept 1986 IV. Strategies for Sustainable Food Security 44. Food security requires more than good conservat ion programmes, which can be - and usually are - overridden and undermined by inappropriate agricult ural, economic, and trade policies. Nor is it just a matter of adding an environmental component to programmes. Fo od strategies must take into account all the polici es that bear upon the threefold challenge of shifting production to where it is most needed, of securing the livelihoods of the rural poor, and of conserving re sources. 1. Government Intervention 45. Government intervention in agriculture is the r ule in both industrial and developing countries, an d it is here to stay. Public investment in agricultural research and extension services, assisted farm credit and m arketing services, and a range of other support systems have all played parts in the successes of the last half -century. In fact, the real problem in many developing countr ies is the weakness of these systems. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 46. Intervention has taken other forms as well. Man y governments regulate virtually the entire food cy cle - inputs and outputs, domestic sales, exports, public procurement, storage and distribution, price contr ols and subsidies - as well as imposing various land use re gulations: acreage, crop variety, and so on. 47. In general, patterns of government intervention suffer three basic defects. First, the criteria th at underlie the planning of these interventions lack an ecological orientation and are often dominated by short-term considerations. These criteria should discourage en vironmentally unsound farm practices and encourage farmers to maintain and improve their soils, forest s, and waters. 48. The second defect is that agricultural policy t ends to operate within a national framework with un iform prices and subsidies, standardized criteria for the provision of support services, indiscriminate fina ncing of infrastructure investments, and so forth. Policies that vary from region to region are needed to refle ct different regional needs, encouraging farmers to adopt practi ces that are ecologically sustainable in their own areas. The problem in agriculture is not faceless. I as a farmer am a potential victim of the system that we now operate under. Why are approximately a quarter of Canadian farmers facing the immediate prospects of farm bankruptcy? It is directly related to the general c oncept of a cheap food policy that has constituted a cornerstone of federal agricultural policy since th e beginning of settlement. We regard the current cheap food policy as a form o f economic violence that is contributing towards so il exploitation and the growing impersonal relationshi p between farmers and the soil for economic surviva l. It is a policy of industrialization that can lead only towa rds disaster economically for us as farmers, and environmentally for us all as Canadians and as worl d citizens. Wayne Easter President, National Farmers' Union WCED Public Hearing Ottawa, 26/27 May 1986 49. The importance of regional policy differentiati on can be easily illustrated: Hill areas may require incentive prices for fruits and subsidized supplies of foodgrains to induce fa rmers to shift towards horticulture, which may be ecologi cally more sustainable. In areas prone to wind and water erosion, public i ntervention through subsidies and other measures should encourage farmers to conserve soil and water . Farmers on land over recharge areas for undergroun d aquifers subject to nitrate pollution might be gi ven incentives to maintain soil fertility and increase productivity by means other than nitrate fertilizer s. 50. The third defect in government intervention lie s in incentive structures. In industrialized countr ies, overprotection of farmers and overproduction repres ent the accumulated result of tax reliefs, direct s ubsidies, and price controls. Such policies are now studded w ith contradictions that encourage the degradation o f the agricultural resource base and. in the long run, do more harm than good to the agricultural industry. Some governments now recognize this and are making effor ts to change the focus of the subsidies from produc tion growth to conservation. 51. On the other hand, in most developing countries the incentive structure is weak. Market interventi ons are often ineffective for lack of an organizational str ucture for procurement and distribution. Farmers ar e exposed to a high degree of uncertainty, and price support sys tems have often favoured the urban dweller or are l imited to a few commercial crops, leading to distortions of c ropping patterns that add to destructive pressures on the resource base. In some cases, price controls reduce the incentive to produce. What is required, in man y cases, is nothing less than a radical attempt to turn the 'terms of trade' in favour of farmers through prici ng policy and government expenditure reallocation. 52. Strengthening food security from a global point of view requires reducing incentives that force overproduction and non-competitive production in th e developed market economies and enhancing those th at encourage food production in developing countries. At the same time, these incentive structures must b e redesigned to promote farming practices that conser ve and enhance the agricultural resource base. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 2. A Global Perspective 53. Trade in agricultural products tripled between 1950 and 1970; it has doubled since then. Yet, when it comes to farming, countries are at their most conservativ e, continuing to think mainly in local or national terms and concerned, above all, to protect their own farmers at the expense of competitors. 54. Shifting food production towards food-deficit c ountries will require a major shift in trading patt erns. Countries must recognize that all parties lose thro ugh protectionist barriers, which reduce trade in f ood products in which some nations may have genuine adv antage. They must begin by redesigning their trade, tax, and incentive systems using criteria that include e cological and economic sustainability and internati onal comparative advantage. 55. The incentive-driven surpluses in developed mar ket economies increase pressures to export these surpluses at subsidized prices or as non-emergency food aid. Donor and receiving countries should be responsible for the impacts of aid and use it for l ong-term objectives. It can be beneficially used in projects to restore degraded lands, build up rural infrastructu re, and raise the nutrition level of vulnerable gro ups. 3. The Resource Base 56. Agricultural production can only be sustained o n a long-term basis if the land, water, and forests on which it is based are not degraded. As suggested, a reorient ation of public intervention will provide a framewo rk for this. But more specific policies that protect the resourc e base are needed to maintain and even enhance agri cultural productivity and the livelihoods of all rural dwell ers. 3.1 Land Use 57. The initial task in enhancing the resource base will be to delineate broad land categories: enhancement areas, which are capable of sustaining intensive cropping and higher population and consumption levels; prevention areas, which by common consent should n ot be developed for intensive agriculture or. where developed, should be converted to other uses; and restoration areas, where land stripped of vegetati ve cover has either totally lost its productivity o r had it drastically reduced. 58. Identifying land according to 'best use' criter ia requires information that is not always availabl e. Most industrial nations possess inventories and descript ions of their lands, forests, and waters that are d etailed enough to provide a basis for delineating land cate gories. Few developing countries have such inventor ies, but they can and should develop them quickly using sate llite monitoring and other rapidly changing techniq ues./ 32 59. Selection of land for each category could be ma de the responsibility of a board or commission repr esenting the interests involved, especially the poor and mor e marginalized segments of the population. The proc ess must be public in character, with publicly agreed c riteria that combine the best use approach with the level of development required to sustain livelihood. Classif ying land according to best use will determine vari ations in infrastructure provision, support services, promoti onal measures, regulatory restrictions, fiscal subs idies, and other incentives and disincentives. 60. Lands identified as prevention areas should be denied supports and subsidies that would encourage their development for intensive agriculture. But such are as might well support certain ecologically and econ omically sustainable uses such as grazing. fuelwood plantati ons, fruit farming, and forestry. Those redesigning support systems and incentives should focus on a broader ra nge of crops, including those that enhance grazing, soil and water conservation, and so on. 61. In vast areas today natural factors and land us e practices have reduced productivity to a point to o low to sustain even subsistence farming. Treatment of thes e areas must vary from site to site. Governments sh ould give priority to establishing a national policy and multidisciplinary programmes and to creating or st rengthening United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. institutions to restore such areas. Where these alr eady exist, they should be better coordinated and d esigned. The UN Plan of Action to Combat Desertification, wh ich is already in place, requires more support, par ticularly financial. 62. Restoration may require limits on human activit ies so as to permit the regeneration of vegetation. This can be difficult where there are large herds of animals or large numbers of people. for the agreement and participation of the local people are of the highes t importance. The state, with the cooperation of th ose living locally, could protect these areas by declaring the m national reserves. Where these areas are privatel y held, the state might wish either to purchase the land fr om the owners or to provide incentives for its rest oration. Intensive agriculture may quickly exhaust the soil cover. causing its degradation, unless some special soil protection measures aimed at constant restoration a nd expanded reproduction of fertility are taken. Th e task of agriculture is thus not confined to obtaining the b iological product but extends to constant maintenan ce and augmentation of soil fertility. Otherwise we will v ery quickly consume what by right belongs to our ch ildren, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, to say noth ing of more distant descendants. It is this misgiving - that our generation lives to a certain extent at the expense of the coming gene rations, thoughtlessly drawing on the basic reserves of soil fertility accumulated in the millennia of the bios pheric development. instead of living off the current annu al increment - that causes the increasing concern o f scientists dealing with the state of the planetary soil cover. B. G. Rozanov Moscow State University WCED Public Hearing Moscow, 11 Dec 1986 3.2 Water Management 63. Improvements in water management are essential to raise agricultural productivity and to reduce la nd degradation and water pollution. Critical issues co ncern the design of irrigation projects and the eff iciency of water use. 64. Where water is scarce, an irrigation project sh ould maximize productivity per unit of water; where water is plentiful, it must maximize productivity per unit o f land. But local conditions will dictate how much water can be used without damaging the soil. Salinization. alkal ization, and waterlogging can be avoided by a more careful approach to drainage, maintenance, cropping pattern s. the regulation of water quantities, and more rat ional water charges. Many of these objectives will be eas ier to realize in small-scale irrigation projects. But whether small or large, the projects must be designed with the abilities and aims of the participating farmers in mind, and then involve them in the management. 65. In some areas excessive use of ground-water is rapidly lowering the water table - usually a case w here private benefits are being realized at society's ex pense. Where ground-water use exceeds the recharge capacity of local aquifers, regulatory or fiscal co ntrols become essential. The combined use of ground and surface water can improve the timing of water avail ability and stretch limited supplies. 3.3 Alternatives to Chemicals 66. Many countries can and should increase yields b y greater use of chemical fertilizers and pesticide s, particularly in the developing world. But countries can also improve yields by helping farmers to use organic nutrients more efficiently. Hence governments must encourage the use of more organic plant nutrients t o complement chemicals. Pest control must also be bas ed increasingly on the use of natural methods. (See Box 5-2) These strategies require changes in public pol icies, which now encourage the increased use of che mical pesticides and fertilizers. The legislative, policy , and research capacity for advancing non-chemical and less- chemical strategies must be established and sustain ed. 67. Chemical fertilisers and pesticides are heavily subsidized in many countries. These subsidies prom ote chemical use precisely in the more commercially ori ented agricultural areas where their environmental damage may already outweigh any increases in productivity they bring. Hence different regions will require di fferent policies to regulate and promote chemical use. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 68. Legislative and institutional frameworks for co ntrolling agrochemicals must be greatly strengthene d everywhere. 69, Industrialized countries must tighten controls on pesticide exports. (See Chapter 8.) Developing c ountries must possess the basic legislative and institutiona l instruments to manage the use of agricultural che micals within their countries. And they will need technica l and financial assistance to do so. 3.4 Forestry and Agriculture 69. Undisturbed forests protect watersheds, reduce erosion. offer habitats for wild species, and play key roles in climatic systems. They are also an economic reso urce providing timber, fuelwood, and other products . The crucial task is to balance the need to exploit fore sts against the need to preserve them. 70. Sound forest policies can be based only on an a nalysis of the capacity of the forests and the land under them to perform various functions. Such an analysis might lead to some forests being cleared for inten sive cultivation, others for livestock; some forestland might be managed for increased timber production or agroforestry use and some left intact for watershed protection, recreation, or species conservation. T he extension of agriculture into forest areas must be based on scientific classification of land capaciti es. 71. Programmes to preserve forest resources must st art with the local people who are both victims and agents of destruction, and who will bear the burden of any new management scheme./ 33 They should be at the centre of integrated forest management, which is the basis of sustainable agriculture. 72. Such an approach would entail changes in the wa y governments set development priorities, as well a s the evolution of greater responsibility to local govern ments and communities. Contracts covering forest us e will have to be negotiated, or overall environmental sus tainability of forest exploitation and overall envi ronmental and ecosystem conservation. Prices for forest produ cts need to reflect the true resource value of the goods. Box 5-2 Natural Systems of Nutrient Supply and Peat Control Crop residues and farmyard manure are potential so urces of soil nutrients. Organic wastes reduce run-off, increase the take-u p of other nutrients, and improve soil's water-hold ing and erosion-resistance capacity. Using farmyard manure, especially in conjunction w ith intercropping and crop rotation, can greatly lo wer production costs. Overall systems efficiency is enhanced if manure o r vegetable biomass is anaerobically digested in biogas plants, yielding energy for cooking and to r un pumps, motors, or electric generators. Natural systems of biological nitrogen fixation th rough the use of certain annual plants, trees, and micro- organisms have a high potential. Integrated pest management (IPM) reduces the need for agrochemicals. improves a country's balance of payments. releases foreign exchange for other devel opment projects, and creates jobs where they are most needed. IPM requires detailed information about pests and their natural enemies, seed varieties tailored to r esist pests, integrated cropping patterns, and farmers wh o support the approach and are willing to modify fa rm practices to adopt it. 73. Portions of forests may be designated as preven tion areas. These are predominantly national parks, which could be set aside from agricultural exploitation t o conserve soil, water, and wildlife. They may also include marginal lands whose exploitation accelerates land degradation through erosion or desertification. In this connection, the reforestation of degraded forest ar eas is of utmost importance. Conservation areas or national parks can also conserve genetic resources in their natural habitats. (See Chapter 6.) United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 74. Forestry can also be extended into agriculture. Farmers can use agroforestry systems to produce fo od and fuel. In such systems, one or more tree crops are c ombined with one or more food crops or animal farmi ng on the same land, though sometimes at different times. Well-chosen crops reinforce each other and yield m ore food and fuel than when grown separately. The techn ology is particularly suitable for small farmers an d for poor-quality lands. Agroforestry has been practised by traditional farmers everywhere. The challenge t oday is to revive the old methods, improve them, adapt them to the new conditions. and develop new ones./ 34 75. International forestry research organizations s hould work in various tropical countries in various ecosystems along the lines now followed by the Consultative Gr oup on International Agricultural Research. There i s considerable scope for institution building and add itional research on forestry's role in agricultural production, for example by developing models that better predic t the effects on water and soil loss of removing sp ecific portions of forest cover. 3.5 Aquaculture 76. Fisheries and aquaculture are critical to food security in that they provide both protein and empl oyment. The greater part of world fish supply comes from marine fisheries, which yielded 76.8 million tons in 1983 . Landings have increased by 1 million tons per year over the past few years; by the end of the century, a catch of around 100 million tons should be possible./ 35 This is well short of the projected demand. There are indications that much of the naturally available freshwater fish sto cks are fully exploited or damaged by pollution. 77. Aquaculture. or 'fish-farming', which differs f rom conventional fishing in that fish are deliberat ely reared in controlled water bodies, can help meet future needs . Yields from aquaculture have doubled during the l ast decade and now represent about 10 per cent of world production of fishery products./ 36 A five- to tenfold increase is projected by the year 2000, given the n ecessary scientific, financial, and organizational support./ 37 Aquaculture can be undertaken in paddy fields, aban doned raining excavations, small ponds, and many ot her areas with some water, as well as on various commer cial scales: individual, family, cooperative, or co rporate. The expansion of aquaculture should be given high p riority in developing and developed countries. 4. Productivity and yields 78. The conservation and enhancement of agriculture 's resource base will increase production and produ ctivity. But specific measures are required to make inputs m ore effective. This is best done by strengthening t he technological and human resource base for agricultu re in developing countries. Thus at the root of this environmental problem is a land problem that has to be solved if any serious ecological policy is to be taken - and reorientation of the ag ricultural policy has to be undertaken. I believe t hat any conservationist policy has to be followed by a cohe rent agricultural policy that will meet the need no t only of preservation as such but also meet the needs of the Brazilian population. Julio M.G. Gaiger President, National Indian Support Association WCED Public Hearing Sao Paulo. 28/29 Oct 1985 4.1 The Technological Base Blends of traditional and modern technologies offer possibilities for improving nutrition and increasi ng rural employment on a sustainable basis. Biotechnology, i ncluding tissue culture techniques, technologies fo r preparing value-added products from biomass, micro- electronics, computer sciences, satellite imagery, and communication. technology are all aspects of fronti er technologies that can improve agricultural produ ctivity and resource management./ 38 80. Providing sustainable livelihoods for resource- poor farmers presents a special challenge for agric ultural research. The major advances in agricultural techno logy in recent decades are better suited to stable, uniform, resource-rich conditions with good soils and ample water supplies. New technologies are most urgently needed in sub-Saharan Africa and the remoter areas of Asia and Latin America, which typically have unreliable rainfall, uneven topography, and poorer soils, and hence are unsuited to Green Revolution technologies. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 81. To serve agriculture in these areas, research h as to be less centralized and more sensitive to far mers' conditions and priorities. Scientists will need to start talking to poor farmers and basing research p riorities on growers' priorities. Researchers must learn from an d develop the innovations of farmers and not just t he reverse. More adaptive research should be done righ t on the farm, using research stations for referral and with farmers eventually evaluating the results. 82. Commercial enterprises can help develop and dif fuse technology, but public institutions must provi de the essential framework for agricultural research and e xtension. Pew academic and research institutions in developing regions are adequately funded. The probl em is most acute in the low-income countries, where expenditure on agricultural research and extension amounts to 0.9 per cent of total agricultural incom e, as against 1.5 per cent in the middle-income countries ./ 39 Research and extension efforts must be greatly expanded, especially in areas where climate, soils, and terrain pose special problems. 83. These areas particularly will need new seed var ieties, but so will much developing-country agricul ture. At present, 55 per cent of the world's scientifically stored plant genetic resources is controlled by ins titutions in industrial countries, 31 per cent by institutions i n developing countries, and 14 per cent by Internat ional Agricultural Research centres./ 40 Much of this genetic material originated in develo ping countries. These gene banks must increase their inventories of material, improve their storage techniques, and ensure that t he resources are readily accessible to research centre s in developing countries. 84. Private companies increasingly seek proprietary rights to improved seed varieties, often without r ecognizing the rights of the countries from which the plant ma tter was obtained. This could discourage countries rich in genetic resources from making these internationally available and thus reduce the options for seed development in all countries. The genetic research capabilities of developing countries are so limited that agriculture there could become excessively dependen t on private gene banks and seed companies elsewher e. Thus international cooperation and a clear understa nding on the sharing of gains are vital in critical areas of agricultural technology, such as the development of new seed varieties. 4.2 Human Resources 85. The technological transformation of traditional agriculture will be difficult without a matching e ffort to develop human resources. (See Chapter 4.) This mean s educational reforms to produce researchers more attuned to the needs of rural peoples and agricultu re. Illiteracy is still widespread among the rural poor. But efforts to promote literacy should focus attention on functional literacy covering the efficient use o f land, water, and forests. 86. Despite women's critical role in agriculture, t heir access to education and their representation i n research, extension, and other support services is woefully i nadequate. Women should be given the same education al opportunities as men. There should be more female e xtension workers, and women should participate in f ield visits. Women should be given more power to take de cisions regarding agricultural and forestry program mes. 4.3 Productivity of Inputs 87. In traditional agriculture, local organic mater ial provided farmers with sources of energy, nutrie nts, and ways of controlling pests. Today, these needs are increa singly met by electricity, petroleum products, chem ical fertilizers, and pesticides. The cost of these inpu ts forms a growing proportion of agricultural costs , and wasteful use does economic and ecological harm. 88. One of the most important energy-related needs is mechanical power for irrigation. The efficiency of pumps could be greatly improved by providing appropriate incentives for equipment producers and farmers, and through effective extension work. Energy for irriga tion pumps can also be provided by wind generators or by conventional internal combustion engines running on biogas produced from local biomass wastes. Solar d ryers and solar coolers can save agricultural products. T hese non-conventional sources should be promoted, particularly in areas poor in energy resources. 89. Nutrients are lost when fertilizers are imprope rly applied. Often they leach away with the flow of water in a field and degrade local water supplies. Similar pro blems of waste and destructive side effects occur i n the use United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. of pesticides. Hence extension systems and chemical manufacturers will need to give priority to progra mmes to promote careful and economical use of these expensi ve, toxic materials. 5. Equity 90. The challenge of sustainable agriculture is to raise not just average productivity and incomes, bu t also the productivity and incomes of those poor in resources . And food security is not just a question of raisi ng food production, but of ensuring that the rural and urba n poor do not go hungry during the short term or mi dst a local food scarcity. All this requires the systematic pro motion of equity in food production and distributio n. 5.1 Land Reforms 91. In many countries where land is very unequally distributed land reform is a basic requirement. Wit hout it, institutional and policy changes meant to protect t he resource base can actually promote inequalities by shutting the poor off from resources and by favouri ng those with large farms, who are better able to o btain the limited credit and services available. By leaving h undreds of millions without options, such changes c an have the opposite of their intended effect, ensuring the continued violation of ecological imperatives. 92. Given institutional and ecological variations, a universal approach to land reform is impossible. Each country should work out its own programme of land r eform to assist the land-poor and to provide a base for coordinated resource conservation. The redistributi on of land is particularly important where large es tates and vast numbers of the land-poor coexist. Crucial comp onents include the reform of tenancy arrangements, security of tenure, and the clear recording of land rights. In agrarian reforms the productivity of th e land and. in forest areas, the protection of forests should be a major concern. 93. In areas where holdings are fragmented into man y non-contiguous plots, land consolidation can ease the implementation of resource conservation measures. P romoting cooperative efforts by small farmers - in pest control or water management, for instance - would a lso help conserve resources. 94. In many countries women do not have direct land rights; titles go to men only. In the interests of food security, land reforms should recognize women's rol e in growing food. Women, especially those heading households, should be given direct land rights. 5.2 Subsistence Farmers and Pastoralists 95. Subsistence farmers, pastoralists, and nomads t hreaten the environmental resource base when proces ses beyond their control squeeze their numbers onto lan d or into areas that cannot support them. 96. The traditional rights of subsistence farmers, particularly shifting cultivators, pastoralists. an d nomads, must therefore be protected from encroachments. Land ten ure rights and communal rights in particular must b e respected. When their traditional practices threate n the resource base, their rights may have to be cu rtailed, but only when alternatives have been provided. Most of these groups will need to be helped to diversify th eir livelihoods by entering the market economy through employment programmes and some cash-crop production . 97. Research should give early attention to the var ied requirements of the mixed farming typical in su bsistence agriculture. Extension and input supply systems mus t become more mobile to reach shifting cultivators and nomads and priority given to public investment to i mprove their cropland, grazing areas, and water sou rces. 5.3 Integrated Rural Development 98. Rural populations will continue to increase in many countries. With existing patterns of land dist ribution, the number of smallholders and landless households will increase by about 50 million, to nearly 220 millio n, by the year 2000./ 41 Together, these groups represent three-quarters of the agricultural households in developing countries./ 42 Without adequate livelihood opportunities, these r esource-poor households will remain poor and be forced to overuse the resource base to survive. 99. Considerable effort has gone into creating stra tegies of integrated rural development, and the req uirements and pitfalls are well known. Experience has shown t hat land reform is necessary but alone is not enoug h without support through the distribution of inputs and rural services. Smallholders, including - indee d especially United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. - women, must be given preference when allocating s carce resources, staff, and credit. Small farmers m ust also be more involved in formulating agricultural p olicies. 100. Integrated rural development also requires res ources to absorb the large increases in rural worki ng populations expected in most developing countries t hrough non-agricultural work opportunities, which s hould be promoted in rural areas. Successful agricultural development and the growth in incomes should open up opportunities in service activities and small-scale manufacturing if supported by public policy. 5.4 Food Availability Fluctuations 101. Environmental degradation can make food shorta ges more frequent and more severe. Hence sustainabl e agricultural development will reduce the season-to- season variability in food supplies. But such syste ms cannot eliminate it. There will be weather-induced fluctua tions, and the growing dependence on only a few cro p varieties over large areas may amplify the effects of weather and pest damage. Often it is the poorest households and the ecologically disadvantaged regio ns that suffer most from these shortages. 102. Food stocks are crucial in dealing with shorta ges. At present, the world stock of cereals is on t he order of 20 per cent of annual consumption: The developing w orld controls about one-third of the stock and the industrial world, two-thirds. More than half the de veloping-country stock is in two countries - China and India. Stock levels in most of the others provide only for immediate operational requirements; there is littl e by way of a reserve./ 43 As agriculture production is being developed, a ris ing number of farmers have been able to purchase tr actors. But they find that, after using them for a year, it becomes much more expensive than they expected bec ause they have to spend a tremendous amount of money on expensive spare parts. Perhaps we might recommend that Indonesia establish a factory that makes these spare parts, before they continue encouraging intr oduction of tractors in agriculture. For this reason, a number of loans that the governm ent has been providing for farmers to modernize the ir agricultural techniques, particularly buying tracto rs, have not been paid back. If the tractors were s till running, they could probably pay back their loans. In fact, now these tractors are becoming a problem themselve s, because they sit around getting rusty. and thus tur ning into pollution. Andi Mappasala Chairman. Yayasan Tellung Poccoe WCED Public Hearing Jakarta. 26 March 1985 103. The food stocks of industrialized countries ar e essentially surpluses, and provide a basis for em ergency assistance, which must be maintained. But emergency food aid is a precarious basis for food security: developing countries should build up national stock s in surplus years to provide reserves as well as encouraging development of food security at the hou sehold level. To do this, they will need an effecti ve system of public support for measures facilitating the pur chase, transportation, and distribution of food. Th e provision of strategically located storage facilities is critica l both to reduce post-harvest losses and to provide a base for quick interventions in emergencies. 104. During most food shortages, poor households no t only cannot produce food but also lose their usua l sources of income and cannot buy the food that is a vailable. Hence food security also requires that ma chinery is available promptly to put purchasing power in th e hands of disaster-struck households, through emer gency public works programme, and through measures to pro tect small farmers from crop failures. V. Food for the Future 105. The challenge of increasing food production to keep pace with demand, while retaining the essenti al ecological integrity of production systems, is colo ssal both in its magnitude and complexity. But we h ave the Knowledge we need to conserve our land and water re sources. New technologies provide opportunities for increasing productivity while reducing pressures on resources. A new generation of farmers combine experience with education. With these resources at our command, we can meet the needs of the human fam ily. Standing in the way is the narrow focus of agricult ural planning and policies. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 106. The application of the concept of sustainable development to the effort to ensure food security r equires systematic attention to the renewal of natural reso urces. It requires a holistic approach focused on e cosystems at national, regional. and global levels, with coor dinated land use and careful planning of water usag e and forest exploitation. The goal of ecological securit y should be embedded firmly in the mandates of FAO. other UN organizations that deal with agriculture, and al l other appropriate international agencies. It will also require an enhancement and reorientation of international a ssistance. (See Chapter 3.) 107. The agricultural systems that have been built up over the past few decades have contributed great ly to the alleviation of hunger and the raising of living sta ndards. They have served their purposes up to a poi nt. But they were built for the purposes of a smaller, more frag mented world. New realities reveal their inherent contradictions. These realities require agricultura l systems that focus as much attention on people as they do on technology, as much on resources as on productio n, as much on the long term as on the short term. O nly such systems can meet the challenge of the future.

Conservation of living natural resources - plant s, animals, and micro-organisms, and the non-living elements of the environment on which they depend - is crucia l for development. Today, the conservation of wild living resources is on the agenda of governments; nearly 4 per cent of the Earth's land area is managed expli citly to conserve species and ecosystems, and all but a smal l handful of countries have national parks. The cha llenge facing nations today is no longer deciding whether conservation is a good idea, but rather how it can be implemented in the national interest and within the means available in each country. I. The Problem: Character and Extent 2. Species and their genetic materials promise to p lay an expanding role in development, and a powerfu l economic rationale is emerging to bolster the ethic al, aesthetic, and scientific cases for preserving them. The genetic variability and germplasm material of speci es make contributions to agriculture, medicine, and industry worth many billions of dollars per year. 3. Yet scientists have intensively investigated onl y one in every 100 of Earth's plant species, and a far smaller proportion of animal species. If nations can ensure the survival of species, the world can look forwar d to new and improved foods, new drugs and medicines, and ne w raw materials for industry. This - the scope for species to make a fast-growing contribution to human welfar e in myriad forms - is a major justification for ex panded efforts to safeguard Earth's millions of species. 4. Equally important are the vital life processes c arried out by nature, including stabilization of cl imate, protection of watersheds and soil, preservation of nurseries and breeding grounds, and so on. Conservi ng these processes cannot be divorced from conserving the individual species within natural ecosystems. Managing species and ecosystems together is clearly the most rational way to approach the problem. Numerous examples of workable solutions to local pr oblems are available./ 1 5. Species and natural ecosystems make many importa nt contributions to human welfare. Yet these very important resources are seldom being used in ways t hat will be able to meet the growing pressures of f uture high demands for both goods and services that depen d upon these natural resources. 6. There is a growing scientific consensus that spe cies are disappearing at rates never before witness ed on the planet. But there is also controversy over those ra tes and the risks they entail. The world is losing precisely those species about which it knows nothing or littl e; they are being lost in the remotest habitats. Th e growing scientific concern is relatively new and the data b ase to support it fragile. But it firms yearly with each new field report and satellite study. 7. Many ecosystems that are rich biologically and p romising in material benefits are severely threaten ed. Vast stocks of biological diversity are in danger of dis appearing just as science is learning how to exploi t genetic variability through the advances of genetic enginee ring. Numerous studies document this crisis with ex amples from tropical forests, temperate forests, mangrove forests, coral reefs, savannas, grasslands, and ari d zones./ 2 Although most of these studies are generalized in t heir documentation and few offer lists of individua l species at risk or recently extinct, some present species-b y-species details. (See Box 6-1.) 8. Habitat alteration and species extinction are no t the only threat. The planet is also being impover ished by the loss of races and varieties within species. The var iety of genetic riches inherent in one single speci es can be seen in the variability manifested in the many race s of dogs, or the many specialized types of maize d eveloped by breeders./ 3 9. Many species are losing whole populations at a r ate that quickly reduces their genetic variability and thus their ability to adapt to climatic change and other forms of environmental adversity. For example, the remaining gene pools of major crop plants such as maize and r ice amount to only a fraction of the genetic divers ity they harboured only a few decades ago, even though the s pecies themselves are anything but threatened. Thus there can be an important difference between loss o f species and loss of gene reservoirs. 10. Some genetic variability inevitably will be los t, but all species should be safeguarded to the ext ent that it is technically, economically, and politically feasible . The genetic landscape is constantly changing thro ugh evolutionary processes, and there is more variabili ty than can be expected to be protected by explicit government programmes. So in terms of genetic conse rvation, governments must be selective, and ask whi ch United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. gene reservoirs most merit a public involvement in protective measures. However, as a more general proposition, governments should enact national laws and public policies that encourage individual, com munity, or corporate responsibility for the protection of g ene reservoirs. 11. But before science can focus on new ways to con serve species, policy makers and the general public for whom policy is made must grasp the size and the urg ency of the threat. Species that are important to h uman welfare are not just wild plants that are relatives of agricultural crops, or animals that are harvest ed. Species such as earthworms, bees, and termites may be far m ore important in terms of the role they play in a h ealthy and productive ecosystem. It would be grim irony in deed if just as new genetic engineering techniques begin to let us peer into life's diversity and use genes mor e effectively to better the human condition, we loo ked and found this treasure sadly depleted. Box 6-1 Some Examples of Species Extinction In Madagascar, until about mid-century, there were 12,000 plant species and probably around 190,000 animal species, with at least 60 per cent of them e ndemic to the island's eastern strip of forest (tha t is, found nowhere else on Earth). At least 93 per cent of the original primary forest has been eliminated. Using these figures, scientists estimate that at le ast half the original species have already disappea red, or are on the point of doing so. Lake Malawi in Central Africa holds over 500 cichl id fish species, 99 per cent of them endemic. The l ake is only one-eighth the size of North America's Grea t Lakes, which feature just 173 species, fewer than 10 per cent of which are endemic. Yet Lake Malawi is t hreatened through pollution from industrial installations and the proposed introduction of alie n species. Western Ecuador is reputed to have once contained between 8,000 and 10,000 plant species, some 40 and 60 per cent of them endemic. Given that there a re between 10 and 30 animal species for every one plant species in similar areas, western Ecuador mus t have contained about 200,000 species. Since 1960, almost all the forests of western Ecuador have been destroyed to make way for banana plantations, oil wells, and human settlements. The number of species thus eliminated is difficult to judge, but the tot al could well number 50.000 or more - all in just 25 y ears. The Pantanal area of Brazil contains 110,000 squar e kilometres of wetlands, probably the most extensi ve and richest in the world. They support the largest and most diversified populations of waterfowl in So uth America. The area has been classified by UNESCO as 'of international importance'. Yet it suffers increasingly from agricultural expansion, dam const ruction, and other forms of disruptive development. Sources: W. Rauh. 'Problems of Biological Conservat ion in Madagascar', in D.

II. Extinction Patterns and Trends 12. Extinction has been a fact of life since life f irst emerged. The present few million species are t he modern- day survivors of the estimated half-billion species that have ever existed. Almost all past extinction s have occurred by natural processes, but today human acti vities are overwhelmingly the main cause of extinct ions. 13. The average duration of a species is some 5 mil lion years. The best current estimates are that on average 900,000 species have become extinct every 1 million years during the last 200 million years, so the av erage 'background rate' of extinction has been very rough ly one in every one and one-ninth years./ 4 The present human-caused rate is hundreds of times higher, and could easily be thousands of times higher./ 5 We do not know. We have no accurate figures on the current ra tes of extinctions, as most of the species vanishin g are those least documented, such as insects in tropical forests. 14. Although tropical moist forests are by far the richest biological units in terms of genetic divers ity and by far the most threatened through human activities, other major ecological zones are also under pressure. Ar id and semi-arid lands harbour only a very small number of species compared with tropical forests. But becaus e of the adaptations of these species to harsh living condit ions, they feature many potentially valuable bioche micals, such as the liquid wax of the jojoba shrub and the natural rubber of the guayule bush. Many of these a re threatened by. among other things, the expansion of livestock herding. 15. Coral reefs, with an estimated half-million spe cies in their 400,000 square kilometres, are being depleted at rates that may leave little but degraded remnants b y early next century. This would be a great loss, i n that coral-reef organisms, by virtue of the 'biological warfare' they engage in to ensure living space in c rowded habitats, have generated an unusual number and vari ety of toxins valuable in modern medicine./ 6 16. Tropical moist forests cover only 6 per cent of the Earth's land surface but contain at least half the Earth's species (which totals 5 million at a minimum, but c ould be as many as 30 million). They may contain 90 per cent or even more of all species. The mature tropic al forests that still exist cover only 900 million hectares, out of the 1.5-1.6 billion hectares that once stood. Be tween 7.6 million and 10 million hectares are elimi nated outright each year, and at least a further 10 milli on hectares are grossly disrupted annually./ 7 But these figures come from surveys of the late 1970s, and since then deforestation rates have probably accelerated. 17. By the end of the century, or shortly thereafte r, there could be little virgin tropical moist fore st left outside of the Zaire Basin and the western half of Brazilian A mazonia, plus some areas such as the Guyana tract o f forest in northern South America and parts of the island o f New Guinea. The forests in these zones are unlike ly to survive beyond a few further decades, as world dema nd for their produce continues to expand and as the number of forestland farmers increases. 18. If deforestation were to continue in Amazonia a t present rates until the year 2000, but then halte d completely (which is unlikely), about 15 per cent o f plant species would be lost. Were Amazonia's fore st cover to be ultimately reduced to those areas now establi shed as parks and reserves, 66 per cent of plant sp ecies would eventually disappear, together with almost 69 per cent of bird species and similar proportions o f all other major categories of species. Almost 20 per cent of the Earth's species are found in Latin American for ests outside of Amazonia; another 20 per cent are found in forests of Asia and Africa outside the Zaire Bas in./ 8 All these forests are threatened, and if they were to d isappear, the species loss could amount to hundreds of thousands. 19. Unless appropriate management measures are take n over the longer term, at least one-quarter, possi bly one-third, and conceivably a still larger share of species existing today could be lost. Many experts suggest that at least 20 per cent of tropical forests should be protected, but to date well under 5 per cent has be en afforded protection of any sort - and many of the tropical f orest parks exist only on paper. 20. Even the most effectively managed parks and pro tected areas are unlikely to provide a sufficient a nswer. In Amazonia, if as much as half the forest were to be safeguarded in some way or another but the other ha lf were to be eliminated or severely disrupted, there might well not be enough moisture in the Amazonian ecosy stem to keep the remaining forest moist./ 9 It could steadily dry up until it became more like an open woodland - with the loss of most of the species adapted to tropical moi st forest conditions.

More widespread climatic changes are likely to emerge within the foreseeable future as the accumul ation of 'greenhouse gases' in the atmosphere leads to globa l warming early in the next century. (See Chapter 7 .) Such a change will produce considerable stress for all e cosystems, making it particularly important that na tural diversity be maintained as a means of adaptation. Twenty years ago, as we decided to intensify our fo rest exploitation, we just thought the resource is available, and we just took it. At the time, we also thought t he intensive selecting out of the trees being cut w ouldn't destroy forest regeneration. Because not all of the trees were being cut. But we forgot that we don't know yet about how the tropical forest should be rehabilitat ed. An indigenous species such as meranti, I don't know the name in English, meranti, rami, is our high-va lued wood, a timber that cannot make a shadow in its par ticular period of growth. And it cannot survive wit hout that shadow. And we still didn't think about it, we just accepted the technology from the West that we have to cut, to exploit our forest. Emmy H. Dharsono NGO Network for Forest Conservation WCED Public Hearing Jakarta, 26 March 1985 III. Some Causes of Extinction 22. The tropics, which host the greatest number and diversity of species, also host most developing na tions, where population growth is fastest and poverty is m ost widespread. If farmers in these countries are f orced to continue with extensive agriculture, which is inher ently unstable and leads to constant movement, then farming will tend to spread throughout remaining wildlife e nvironments. But if they are helped and encouraged to practise more intensive agriculture, they could mak e productive use of relatively limited areas, with less impact on wildlands. 23. They will need help: training, marketing suppor t, and fertilizers, pesticides, and tools they can afford. This will require the full support of governments, inclu ding ensuring that conservation policies are design ed with the benefit of agriculture foremost in mind. It may be expedient to stress the value to farmers rather tha n to wildlife of this programme, but in fact the destinies of the two are intertwined. Species conservation is tied to development, and the problems of both are more poli tical than technical. 24. Population growth is a major threat to conserva tion efforts in many developing nations. Kenya has allocated 6 per cent of its territory as parks and reserves i n order to protect its wildlife and to earn foreign exchange through tourism. But Kenya's present population of 20 million people is already pressing so hard on pa rks that protected land is steadily being lost to invading f armers. And the country's population is projected t o grow fourfold in the next 40 years./ 10 25. Similar population pressures threaten parks in Ethiopia, Uganda. Zimbabwe, and other countries in which a growing but impoverished peasantry is forced to dep end on a dwindling natural resource base. The prosp ects are bleak for parks that do not make important and recognizable contributions to national development objectives. 26. Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia. Cote d'lvoire, Ken ya, Madagascar, Peru, the Philippines. Thailand, an d other nations with an unusual abundance of species alread y suffer a massive flow of farmers from traditional homelands into virgin territories. These areas ofte n include tropical forests. perceived by the migran ts encouraged to farm there as 'free' lands available for unimpeded settlement. The people who are alread y living on such lands at low population densities and with only traditional rights to the land are often swept aside in the rush to develop lands that might better be left in extensively used forest. 27. Many tropical countries with large forest resou rces have provoked wasteful 'timber booms' by assig ning harvesting rights to concessionaires for royalty, r ent, and tax payments that are only a small fractio n of the net commercial value of the timber harvest. They have c ompounded the damage caused by these incentives by offering only short-term leases, requiring concessi onaires to begin harvesting at once, and adopting r oyalty systems that induce loggers to harvest only the bes t trees while doing enormous damage to the remainde r. In response, logging entrepreneurs in several countrie s have leased virtually the entire productive fores t area United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. within a few years and have overexploited the resou rce with little concern for future productivity (wh ile unwittingly opening it for clearing by slash-and-bu rn cultivators)./ 11 28. In Central and South America, many governments have encouraged the large-scale conversion of tropi cal forests to livestock ranches. Many of these ranches have proved ecologically and economically unsound, as the underlying soils are soon depleted of nutrients ; weed species replace planted grasses, and pasture productivity declines abruptly. Yet tens of million s of hectares of tropical forest have been lost to such ranches, largely because governments have underwritten the c onversions with large land grants, tax credits and tax holidays, subsidized loans, and other inducements./ 12 29. The promotion of tropical timber imports into c ertain industrial countries, through low tariffs an d favourable trade incentives, combined with weak domestic fores t policies in tropical countries and with high cost s and disincentives to harvesting in industrial countries , also drives deforestation. Some industrial countr ies typically import unprocessed logs either duty-free or at mini mal tariff rates. This encourages developed country industries to use logs from tropical forests rather than their own, a pattern that is reinforced by do mestic restrictions on the amounts that can be cut in dome stic forests. All of us in Africa are slowly waking up to the fac t the African crisis is essentially an environmenta l problem that has precipitated such adverse symptoms as drought, famine, desertification, overpopulation, environmen tal refugees, political instability, widespread poverty , etc. We are awaking to the fact that if Africa is dying it is because her environment has been plundered, overexploited, and neglected. Many of us in Africa are also waking up to the real ization that no good Samaritans will cross the seas to come to save the African environment. Only we Africans c an and should be sufficiently sensitive to the well -being of our environment. Mrs. Rahab W. Mwatha The Greenbelt Movement WCED Public Hearing Nairobi, 23 Sept 1986 IV. Economic Values at Stake 30. Species conservation is not only justified in e conomic terms. Aesthetic, ethical, cultural, and sc ientific considerations provide ample grounds for conservati on. For those who demand an accounting, the economi c values inherent in the genetic materials of species are alone enough to justify species preservation. 31. Today, industrialized nations record far greate r financial benefits from wild species than do deve loping countries, though unrecorded benefits to people liv ing in the tropical countryside can be considerable . But the industrial countries have the scientific and indust rial capacity to convert the wild material for indu strial and medical use. And they also trade a higher proportio n of their agricultural produce than do developing nations. Northern crop breeders are increasingly dependent o n genetic materials from wild relatives of maize an d wheat, two crops that play leading roles in the int ernational grain trade. The U.S. Department of Agri culture estimates that contributions from plant genetic mat erial lead to increases in productivity that averag e around l per cent annually, with a farm-gate value of well o ver $1 billion (1980 dollars)./ 13 32. The U.S. maize crop suffered a severe setback i n 1970. when a leaf fungus blighted croplands, caus ing losses to farmers worth more than $2 billion. Then fungus-resistant genetic material was found in gene tic stocks that had originated in Mexico./ 14 More recently, a primitive species of maize was di scovered in a montane forest of south-central Mexico./ 15 This wild plant is the most primitive known relati ve of modern maize and was surviving in only three tiny patches coveri ng a mere four hectares in an area threatened with destruction by farmers and loggers. The wild specie s is a perennial; all other forms of maize are annu als. Its cross-breeding with commercial varieties of maize o pens up the prospect that farmers could be spared t he annual expense of ploughing and sowing, since the p lant would grow again yearly of its own accord. The genetic benefits of this wild plant, discovered whe n not more than a few thousand last stalks remained , could total several thousand million dollars a year./ 16 United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 33. Wild species likewise contribute to medicine. H alf of all prescriptions dispensed have their origi ns in wild organisms./ 17 The commercial value of these medicines and drugs in the United States now amounts to some $14 billion a year./ 18 Worldwide, and including non-prescription material s plus pharmaceuticals, the estimated commercial value exceeds $40 billion a year./ 19 Industry also benefits from wildlife./ 20 34. Wildlife-derived materials contribute gums, oil s, resins, dyes, tanning, vegetable fats and waxes, insecticides, and many other compounds. Many wild p lants bear oil-rich seeds that can help in the manu facture of fibres, detergents, starch, and general edibles. For instance, the Fevillea genus of rain-forest vi nes in western Amazonia bear seeds with such a high oil co ntent that a hectare of such vines in an original f orest could produce more oil than a hectare of commercial oil palm plantation./ 21 35. A few plant species contain hydrocarbons rather than carbohydrates./ 22 Certain of these plants can flourish in areas that have been rendered useless through su ch activities as strip-mining. Hence land that has been degraded by extraction of hydrocarbons such as coal could be rehabilitated by growing hydrocarbons on the surface. Moreover, unlike an oil well, a 'petroleum plantation' need never run dry. 36. The emerging field of genetic engineering, by w hich science devises new variations of life forms, does not render wild genes useless. In fact, this new scienc e must be based on existing genetic material and ma kes such material even more valuable and useful. Extinc tion, according to Professor Tom Eisner of Cornell University, 'no longer means the simple loss of one volume from the library of nature. It means the lo ss of a loose-leaf book whose individual pages, were the sp ecies to survive, would remain available in perpetu ity for selective transfer and improvement of other species ./ 23 And Professor Winston Brill of the University of Wisconsin has noted: 'We are entering an age in whi ch genetic wealth, especially in tropical areas suc h as rain forests, until now a relatively inaccessible trust fund, is becoming a currency with high immediate va lue./ 24 37. Genetic engineering may mean that agriculture's Green Revolution will be superseded by a 'Gene Revolution'. This technology raises hopes of eventu ally harvesting crops from deserts, from seawater, and from other environments that did not previously support farming. Medical researchers foresee their own Gene Revolution bringing more innovative advances during the last two decades of this century than occurred during the previous 200 years. 38. Many of the nations with the least capacity for managing living resources are those richest in spe cies; the tropics, which contain at least two-thirds of all s pecies and a still greater proportion of threatened species, roughly coincide with the area generally referred t o as the Third World. Many developing nations recog nize the need to safeguard threatened species but lack the s cientific skills, institutional capacities, and fun ds necessary for conservation. Industrial nations seeking to rea p some of the economic benefits of genetic resource s should support the efforts of Third World nations to conse rve species; they should also seek ways to help tro pical nations and particularly the rural people most dire ctly involved with these species realize some of th e economic benefits of these resources. It will not be possible to restore the population o f 'oomurasaki' - our purple emperor butterfly - to the previous level. The forest for oomurasaki requires weeding, planting of trees, and care and maintenance. The fo rest will be handed down to the succeeding generations. Isn't it wonderful to think that you are linked to the s ucceeding generations by handing down the forest where many o omurasaki fly and people enjoy themselves? It would be nice if we could develop into the heart s of the children the love and affection for nature . We hope to make the forest we are making our gift to the child ren who will live in the 21st century.

The historical approach of establishing nationa l parks that are somehow isolated from the greater society has been overtaken by a new approach to conservatio n of species and ecosystems that can be characteriz ed as 'anticipate and prevent.' This involves adding a new dimension to the now-traditional and yet viabl e and necessary step of protected areas. Development patt erns must be altered to make them more compatible w ith United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. the preservation of the extremely valuable biologic al diversity of the planet. Altering economic and l and use patterns seems to be the best long-term approach to ensuring the survival of wild species and their ecosystems. 40. This more strategic approach deals with the pro blems of species depletion at their sources in deve lopment policies. anticipates the obvious results of the mo re destructive policies, and prevents damage now. A useful tool in promoting this approach is the preparation of National Conservation Strategies (NCS), which br ing the processes of conservation and development together. Preparing an NCS involves government agencies, non - governmental organizations, private interests, and the community at large in analysis of natural resou rce issues and assessment of priority actions. In this way. it is hoped that sectoral interests will better perce ive their interrelationships with other sectors and new poten tials for conservation and development will be reve aled. 41. The link between conservation and development a nd the need to attack the problem at the source can be seen clearly in the case of tropical forests. Somet imes it is government policy, not economic necessit y, that drives the overexploitation and destruction of thes e resources. The direct economic and fiscal costs o f this overexploitation - in addition to those of species extinction - are huge. The result has been wasteful exploitation of the tropical forests, the sacrifice of most of t heir timber and non-timber values. enormous losses of potential revenue to the government, and the destruction of r ich biological resources. 42. Third World governments can stem the destructio n of tropical forests and other reservoirs of biolo gical diversity while achieving economic goals. They can conserve valuable species and habitat while reducin g their economic and fiscal burdens. Reforming forest reven ue systems and concession terms could raise billion s of dollars of additional revenues, promote more effici ent, long-term forest resource use. and curtail def orestation. Governments could save themselves enormous expense and revenue loss, promote more sustainable land uses, and slow down the destruction of tropical for ests by eliminating incentives for livestock ranchi ng. 43. The link between conservation and development a lso requires some changes in trade patterns. This h as been recognized in the establishment in 1986 of the International Tropical Timber Organization, based in Yokohama, Japan, which seeks to rationalize trade f lows. It has been set up to implement the first com modity agreement that incorporates a specific conservation component. 44. Numerous other opportunities can be found to en courage both species conservation and economic productivity. Many governments maintain unrealistic ally low taxes on rural land, while allowing settle rs to establish title to 'virgin' land by converting it t o farmland. Thus wealthy landowners can keep huge, underused estates at little or no cost, while land-hungry pea sants are encouraged to clear forests to establish marginal holdings. Reforms of tax and tenure systems could i ncrease productivity on existing holdings and reduc e the pressures to expand cultivation into forests and up land watersheds. 45. Well-designed ecosystem conservation contribute s to the predominant' goals of sustainable developm ent in a number of ways. Safeguards for critical tracts of wildlands can serve also to safeguard agricultural land, for example. This is particularly true for upland fores ts of the tropics, which protect valley fields from floods and erosion, and waterways and irrigation systems from siltation. 46. A case in point is the Duraoga-Bone Reserve in Indonesia's northern Sulawesi, covering some 3,000 square kilometres of upland forest. It protects lar ge populations of most of Sulawesi's endemic mammal s, and many of the island's 80 endemic bird species. It al so protects the Dumoga Valley Irrigation Scheme, fu nded by a World Bank loan, set up in the flatlands below to achieve a tripling of rice production on more then 13,000 hectares of prime agricultural land./ 25 Similar examples include the Canaima National Park in Venezuela, which protects domestic and industrial water suppli es for a major hydropower facility that, in turn, p rovides electricity to the nation's key industrial centre a nd its capital city. 47. One conclusion from this connection is that gov ernments could think of 'parks for development', in sofar as parks serve the dual purpose of protection for spec ies habitats and development processes at the same time. National efforts to anticipate and prevent the adve rse consequences of development policies in any of these areas would surely yield much more for species cons ervation than all the measures of the past 10 years in support of park building, ranger patrols, anti-poac hing units, and the other conventional forms of wil dlife preservation.

VI. International Action for National Species 48. Species and their genetic resources - whatever their origins - plainly supply benefits to all huma n beings. Wild genetic resources from Mexico and Central Amer ica serve the needs of maize growers and consumers globally. The principal cocoa-growing nations are i n West Africa, while the genetic resources on which modern cocoa plantations depend for their continued produc tivity are found in the forests of western Amazonia . 49. Coffee growers and drinkers depend for the heal th of the crop on constant supplies of new genetic material from coffee's wild relatives, principally located i n Ethiopia. Brazil, which supplies wild rubber germ plasm to Southeast Asia's rubber plantation, itself depends on germplasm supplies from diverse parts of the wor ld to sustain its sugar-cane, soybean, and other leading crops. Without access to foreign sources of fresh germplasm year by year, the nations of Europe and N orth America would quickly find their agricultural output declining. 50. The Earth's endowment of species and natural ec osystems will soon be seen as assets to be conserve d and managed for the benefit of all humanity. This w ill necessarily add the challenge of species conser vation to the international political agenda. 51. At the heart of the issue lies the fact that th ere is often a conflict between the short-term econ omic interest of the individual nations and the long-term interes t of sustainable development and potential economic gains of the world community at large. A major thrust in act ions to conserve genetic diversity must therefore b e directed at making it more economically attractive both in t he short term and in the longer perspective to prot ect wild species and their ecosystems. Developing countries must be ensured an equitable share of the economic profit from the use of genes for commercial purposes. 1. Some Current Initiatives 52. A number of international measures are already being tried. But they are limited in scope, only pa rtially successful, and reactive in nature. UNESCO operates a clearing-house for information on natural areas and genetic resources. Its World Heritage Fund supports the management of a handful of exceptional ecosyst ems around the world, but all these activities receive small budgets. UNESCO has sought to establish a glo bal system of Biosphere Reserves representing the Earth 's 200 'biotic provinces' and harbouring sample communities of species. But only one-third of the n eeded reserves have been established, even though instituting and operating the rest would cost only about $150 million a year./ 26 53. UN agencies such as FAO and UNEP run programmes concerned with threatened species, genetic resources, and outstanding ecosystems. But their co mbined activities are tiny in the face of the large needs. Among national agencies, the U.S. Agency for Intern ational Development leads the field in recognizing the value of species conservation. Legislation passed b y the U.S. Congress in 1986 will make available $2. 5 million a year for this purpose./ 27 Again, this should be considered an important gest ure compared with what has been done to date by bilateral agencies, but trifli ng compared with the needs and opportunities. 54. IUCN, working in close collaboration with UNEP, WWF, the World Bank, and various international tec hnical assistance agencies, has established a 'Conservatio n Monitoring Centre', to provide data on species an d ecosystems for any part of the world quickly and ea sily. This service, which is available to all, can help ensure that development projects are designed with full in formation available about the species and ecosystem s that might be affected. Technical assistance is also ava ilable for nations, sectors, and organizations inte rested in establishing local data bases for their own applica tions. 55. Species problems tend to be perceived largely i n scientific and conservationist terms rather than as a leading economic and resource concern. Thus the iss ue lacks political clout. One important initiative that attempts to put conservation more squarely on the a genda of international development concerns has bee n the Tropical Forestry Action Plan. This collaborative e ffort coordinated by FAO involves the World Bank, I UCN, the World Resources Institute, and UNDP, along with num erous other collaborating institutions. The broad-b ased effort proposes the formulation of national forestr y reviews, national forestry plans, identification of new United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. projects, enhanced cooperation between development aid agencies at work in the forestry sector. and increased flows of technical and financial resource s into forestry and related fields such as' smallho lder agriculture. 56. Establishing norms and procedures with respect to resource issues is at least as important as incr eased funding. Precedents for such norms include the Conv ention on Wetlands of International Importance, the Convention on Conservation of Islands for Science ( both of which safeguard prime habitats and their sp ecies), and the Convention on International Trade in Endang ered Species. These three precedents all help, alth ough the first two are essentially reactive attempts to devise 'species refuges'. As deforestation progresses, it reduces the quality of life of millions of people in developing countr ies; their survival is threatened by the loss of the vegetatio n upon which they depend for their sources of house hold energy and many other goods. If tropical forests co ntinue to be cleared at the current rate, at least 556 million acres (225 million hectares) will be cleared by the year 2000; if destruction of the tropical rain for ests continues unabated, an estimated 10 to 20 per cent of the ear th's plant and animal life will be gone by the year 2000. Reversing deforestation depends on political leader ship and appropriate policy changes by developing-c ountry governments to support community-level initiatives. The key ingredient is active participation by the millions of small farmers and landless people who daily use for ests and trees to meet their needs. J. Gustave Speth President, World Resources Institute WCED Public Hearing Sao Paulo. 28-29 Oct 1985 2. Setting Priorities 57. A first priority is to establish the problem of disappearing species and threatened ecosystems on political agendas as a major resource issue. The World Charte r for Nature, adopted by the UN in October 1982, wa s an important step towards this objective. 58. Governments should investigate the prospect of agreeing to a 'Species Convention', similar in spir it and scope to the Law of the Sea Treaty and other intern ational conventions reflecting principles of 'unive rsal resources'. A Species Convention, such as a draft p repared by IUCN, should articulate the concept of s pecies and genetic variability as a common heritage. 59. Collective responsibility for the common herita ge would not mean collective international rights t o particular resources within nations. This approach need not in terfere with concepts of national sovereignty. But it would mean that individual nations would no longer be lef t to rely on their own isolated efforts to protect species within their borders. 60. Such a Convention would need to be supported by a financial arrangement that would have the active backing of the community of nations. Any such arran gement, and there are several possibilities, must n ot only seek to ensure the conservation of genetic resource s for all people, but assure that the nations that possess many of these resources obtain an equitable share o f the benefits and earnings derived from their development. This would greatly encourage the conse rvation of species. One such arrangement might be a Trust Fund to which all nations could contribute, w ith those benefiting most from the use of these res ources contributing an appropriate share. Governments of t ropical forest nations could receive payments to su pport the conservation of given areas of forest, with such pa yments rising or falling depending on the degree to which the forests are maintained and protected./ 28 61. The sums required for effective conservation ar e large. Traditional-type conservation needs in tro pical forests alone require outlays of $170 million a yea r for at least five years./ 29 However, the network of protected areas that the world will need by the year 2050 mus t include much larger areas brought under some degr ee of protection and a sophisticated degree of flexibilit y in management techniques./ 30 62. More funds will also be required for conservati on activities outside protected areas: wildlife man agement, ecodevelopment areas, education campaigns, and so o n. Other approaches of a less expensive sort includ e the conservation of wild gene reservoirs of special significance through 'genetic conservation areas' in countries United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. well endowed with biological wealth. Much of this w ork can be carried out by citizens' groups and othe r non- governmental means. 63. International development agencies - the World Bank and other major lending banks. UN agencies, an d bilateral agencies -should give comprehensive and s ystematic attention to the problems and opportuniti es of species conservation. Although the international tr ade in wildlife and wildlife products is considerab le, to date the economic values inherent in genetic variability and ecological processes have been generally disre garded. Possible measures include environmental impact anal yses of development projects with particular attent ion to species' habitats and life-support systems, identif ication of crucial localities featuring exceptional concentrations of species with exceptional levels of endemism that face exceptional degrees of threat, and special opportunities for linking species conservation with development aid. VII. Scope for National Action 64. As indicated earlier, governments need to follo w a new approach in this field - one of anticipatin g the impact of their policies in numerous sectors and acting to prevent undesirable consequences. They should revi ew programmes in areas such as agriculture, forestry, and settlements that serve to degrade and destroy s pecies' habitats. Governments should determine how many mor e protected areas are needed, especially in the spi rit of how such areas can contribute to national developme nt objectives, and make further provision for prote ction of gene reservoirs (for instance, primitive cultivated varieties) that may not normally be preserved thro ugh conventional protected areas. 65. In addition, governments need to reinforce and expand existing strategies. Urgent needs include be tter wildlife and protected-area management, more protec ted areas of a non-conventional type (such as the ecological stations that are proving reasonably suc cessful in Brazil), more game cropping and ranching projects (such as the crocodile schemes in India, Papua New Guinea, Thailand, and Zimbabwe), more promotion of wildlife-based tourism, and stronger anti-poaching measures (even though relatively few species are threatened by poaching, compared with the vast numb ers threatened by habitat loss). National Conservat ion Strategies, such as those already prepared in over 25 countries, can be important tools for coordinati ng conservation and development programmes. 66. Other measures governments could take to confro nt the crisis of disappearing species, recognizing that it constitutes a major resource and development challe nge, include consideration of species conservation needs and opportunities in land use planning and the expl icit incorporation of their genetic resource stocks into national accounting systems. This could entail esta blishing a natural-resource accounting system that directs particular attention to species as high-value yet l ittle-appreciated resources. Finally, they should s upport and expand programmes of public education to ensure tha t the species question receives the attention it de serves throughout the entire population. 67. Every nation has only limited resources at its disposal for dealing with conservation priorities. The dilemma is how to use these resources most effectively. Coo peration with neighbouring nations sharing species and ecosystems can help streamline programmes as well a s share expenses for regional initiatives. Explicit efforts to save particular species will be possible for onl y relatively few of the more spectacular or importa nt ones. Agonizing as it will be to make such choices, plann ers need to make conservation strategies as systema tically selective as possible. No one cares for the prospec t of consigning threatened species to oblivion. But insofar as choices are already being made, unwittingly, they s hould be made with selective discretion that takes into account the impact of the extinction of a species u pon the biosphere or on the integrity of a given ec osystem. 68. But even though public effort may be concentrat ed on a few species, all species are important and deserve some degree of attention; this might take the form of tax credits to farmers willing to maintain primi tive cultivars. an end to incentives to clear virgin forest, the pr omotion of research attention from local universiti es, and the preparation of basic inventories of native flora an d fauna by national institutions. The world is unfortunately not what we would like i t to be. The problems are many and great. Actually, they can only be solved with cooperation and quick-wittednes s. I represent an organization called 'Nature and Yout h'. I know that I have full support among our membe rs when I say that we are worried about the future if drast ic changes do not take place, concerning the world' s way of treating our essential condition, nature. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. We who work with youth, and are youth ourselves in Norway today, know very well how the destroying of nature leads to an apathetic fear among youth conce rning their future and how it will turn out. It is of great importance that common people get th e chance to take part in deciding how nature should be treated. Frederic Hauge Nature and Youth WCED Public Hearing Oslo, 24-25 June 1985 VIII. The Need for Action 69. There are numerous signs that the loss of speci es and their ecosystems is being taken seriously as a phenomenon that carries practical implications for people all around the world, now and for generation s to come. 70. The recent rise in public concern can be seen i n such developments as the growth in Kenya's Wildli fe Clubs. now numbering more than 1,500 school clubs w ith around 100.000 members./ 31 A parallel development in conservation education has occurred in Zambia. I n Indonesia, some 400 conservation groups have join ed together under the banner of the Indonesian Environ mental Forum and exert strong political influence./ 32 In the United States, membership of the Audubon Society re ached 385,000 in 1985./ 33 In the Soviet Union, nature clubs have over 35 million members./ 34 All of these indicate that the public puts a value on nature that is beyond the normal economic imperatives. 71. In response to this popular concern, government s have been moving to help species threatened withi n their borders, primarily through the establishment of add itional protected areas. Today, the worldwide netwo rk of protected areas totals more than 4 million square k ilometres, roughly equivalent to the size of most o f the countries of Western Europe combined, or twice the size of Indonesia. In terms of continental coverage , protected areas in Europe (outside the USSR) amount ed by 1985 to 3.9 per cent of territory; in the USS R, to 2.5 per cent; in North America, to 8.1 per cent; in South America, to 6.1 per cent; in Africa, to 6.5 per cent; and in Asia (outside the USSR) and Australia, to 4.3 pe r cent each./ 35 72. Since 1970, the networks have expanded in exten t by more than 80 per cent, around two-thirds of wh ich are in the Third World. But a great deal more remai ns to be done; a consensus of professional opinion suggests that the total expanse of protected areas needs to be at least tripled if it is to constitute a representative sample of Earth's ecosystems./ 36 73. There is still time to save species and their e cosystems. It is an indispensable prerequisite for sustainable development. Our failure to do so will not be forgi ven by future generations.

Energy Conservation Measures Conclusion United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 1. Energy is necessary for daily survival. Future d evelopment crucially depends on its long-term avail ability in increasing quantities from sources that are dependa ble, safe, and environmentally sound. At present, n o single source or mix of sources is at hand to meet this fu ture need. 2. Concern about a dependable future for energy is only natural since energy provides 'essential servi ces' for human life - heat for warmth, cooking, and manufact uring, or power for transport and mechanical work. At present, the energy to provide these services comes from fuels - oil, gas, coal, nuclear, wood, and ot her primary sources (solar, wind, or water power) - tha t are all useless until they are converted into the energy services needed, by machines or other kinds of end- use equipment, such as stoves, turbines, or motors. In many countries worldwide, a lot of primary energy i s wasted because of the inefficient design or runni ng of the equipment used to convert it into the services requ ired; though there is an encouraging growth in awar eness of energy conservation and efficiency. 3. Today's primary sources of energy are mainly non -renewable: natural gas, oil, coal, peat, and conve ntional nuclear power. There are also renewable sources, in cluding wood, plants, dung, falling water, geotherm al sources, solar, tidal, wind, and wave energy, as we ll as human and animal muscle-power. Nuclear reacto rs that produce their own fuel ('breeders') and eventually fusion reactors are also in this category. In theor y, all the various energy sources can contribute to the future energy mix worldwide. But each has its own economi c, health, and environmental costs, benefits, and risk s - factors that interact strongly with other gover nmental and global priorities. Choices must be made, but in the certain knowledge that choosing an energy strategy inevitably means choosing an environmental strategy . 4. Patterns and changes of energy use today are alr eady dictating patterns well into the next century. We approach this question from the standpoint of susta inability. The key elements of sustainability that have to be reconciled are: sufficient growth of energy supplies to meet human needs (which means accommodating a minimum of 3 per cent per capita income growth in developing cou ntries); energy efficiency and conservation measures, such that waste of primary resources is minimized; public health, recognizing the problems of risks t o safety inherent in energy sources; and protection of the biosphere and prevention of more localized forms of pollution. 5. The period ahead must be regarded as transitiona l from an era in which energy has been used in an unsustainable manner. A generally acceptable pathwa y to a safe and sustainable energy future has not y et been found. We do not believe that these dilemmas h ave yet been addressed by the international communi ty with a sufficient sense of urgency and in a global perspective. I. Energy, Economy, and Environment 6. The growth or energy demand in response to indus trialization, urbanization, and societal affluence has led to an extremely uneven global distribution of primary energy consumption. /1 The consumption of energy per person in industrial market economies, for example, is more than 80 times greater than in sub-Saharan Africa. (See Table 7-1.) And about a quarter of the world's population consumes three-quarters of the world's primary energy. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. Table 7-1 Global Primary Energy Consumption Per Capita, 1984 GNP Per Capita Energy Consumption Mid-1984 Population Total Consumption (1984 dollars) (kW per capita*) (million) (TW) World Bank GNP Economy Category Low Income 260 0.41 2,390 0.99 Sub-Saharan Africa 210 148 0.04 High-Income Oil Exporters 11,250 5.17 19 0.10 Industrial Market Economies 11,430 7.01 733 5.14 East European Non-Market Economies 6.27 389 2.44 World 2.11** 4.718 9.94 *kW per capita is kW ** Population-weighted average energy consumption ( kW/capita) for first three main categories is 0.654 and for industrial market and East European categories is 6 .76. Source: Based on World Bank, World Development Repo rt 1985 (New York: Oxford University Press, 1986). 7. In 1980, global energy consumption stood at arou nd 10TW. /2 (See Box 7-1.) if per capita use remained at the same levels as today, by 2025 a global populati on of 6.2 billion /3 would need about 14TW (over 4TW in developing and over 9TW in industrial countries) - an increase of 40 per cent over 1980. But if energy consumption per head became uniform worldwide at cu rrent industrial country levels, by 2025 that same global population would require about 55TW. Box 7-1 Energy Units A variety of units are used to measure energy produ ction and use in physical terms. This chapter user; the kilowatt (kW); the Gigawatt (GW), which is equal to 1 million kW; and the Terawatt (TW), which is equa l to 1 billion kilowatts. One kilowatt - a thousand watts of energy - if emitted continuously for a year is l kW year. Consuming 1 kW year/year is equivalent to the energ y liberated by burning 1,050 kilogrammes - approxim ately 1 ton - of coal annually. Thus a TW year is equal t o approximately 1 billion tons of coal. Throughout the chapter, TW years/year is written as TW. 8. Neither the 'low' nor the 'high' figure is likel y to prove realistic, but they give a rough idea of the range within which energy futures could move, at least hypotheti cally. Many other scenarios can be generated in-bet ween, some of which assume an improved energy base for th e developing world. For instance, if the average en ergy consumption in the low- and middle-income economies trebled and doubled, respectively, and if consumpt ion in the high-income oil-exporting and industrial market and non-market countries remained the same as toda y, then the two groups would be consuming about the sa me amounts of energy. The low- and middle-income categories would need 10.5TW and the three 'high' c ategories would use 9.3TW - totalling 20TW globally , assuming that primary energy is used at the same le vels of efficiency as today. 9. How practical are any of these scenarios? Energy analysts have conducted many studies of global ene rgy futures to the years 2020-2030. /4 Such studies do not provide forecasts of future en ergy needs, but they United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. explore how various technical, economic, and enviro nmental factors may interact with supply and demand . Two of these are reviewed in Box 7-2, though a much wid er range of scenarios - from 5TW up to 63TW - are available. In general, the lower scenarios (14.4TW by 2030, /5 11.2TW by 2020. /6 and 5.2 by 2030 /7 ) require an energy efficiency revolution. The higher scenarios (18.8TW by 2025. /8 24.7TW by 2020, /9 and 35.2 by 2030 /10 ) aggravate the environmental pollution problems th at we have experienced since the Second World War. Box 7-2 Two Indicative Energy Scenarios Case A: High Scenario By the year 2030, a 35TW future would involve produ cing 1.6 tines as much oil, 3.4 times as much natur al gas, and nearly 5 times as much coal as in 1960. This in crease in fossil fuel use implies bringing the equi valent of a new Alaska pipeline into production every one to tw o years. Nuclear capacity would have to be increase d 30 times over 1960 levels - equivalent to installing a new nuclear power station generating 1-gigawatt of electricity every two to four days. This 35TW scenario is still well below the 55TW future that assumes today's le vels of energy consumption per capita in industrial countri es are achieved in all countries. Case B: Low Scenario Taking the 11.2TW scenario as a highly optimistic e xample of a strong conservation strategy. 2020 ener gy demand in developing and industrial countries is qu oted as 7.3TW and 3.9TW respectively, as compared w ith 3.3TW and 7.0TW in 1980. This would mean a saving o f 3.1TW in industrial countries by 2020 and an additional requirement of 4.0TW in developing count ries. Even if developing countries were able to acq uire the liberated primary resource, they would still be lef t with a shortfall of 0.9TW in primary supply. Such a deficit is likely to be much greater (possibly two to three ti mes), given the extreme level of efficiency require d for this scenario, which is unlikely to be realized by most governments. In 1980, the following breakdown of pr imary supply was quoted: oil, 4.2TW; coal, 2.4; gas, 1.7; renewables, 1.7; and nuclear, 0.2. The question is - where will the shortfall in primary energy supply come fr om? This rough calculation serves to illustrate tha t the postulated average growth of around 30 per cent per capita in primary consumption in developing countr ies will still require considerable amounts of primary suppl y even under extremely efficient energy usage regim es. Sources: The 35TW scenario was originated in Energy Systems Group of the International Institute for A pplied Systems Analysis, Energy in a Finite World - A Glob al Systems Analysis, (Cambridge, Mass.: Ballinger, 1981); all other calculations are from J. Goldemberg et al ., 'An End-Use Oriented Global Energy Strategy', An nual Review of Energy, Vol. 10, 1985. 10. The economic implications of a high energy futu re are disturbing. A recent World Bank Study indica tes that for the period 1960-95, a 4.1 per cent annual growt h in energy consumption, approximately comparable t o Case A in Box 7-2, would require an average annual investment of some $130 billion (in 1982 dollars) i n developing countries alone. This would involve doub ling the share of energy investment in terms of agg regate gross domestic product. /11 About half of this would have to come from foreign exchange and the rest from internal spending on energy in developing countries . 11. The environmental risks and uncertainties of a high energy future are also disturbing and give ris e to several reservations. Four stand out: the serious probability of climate change generate d by the 'greenhouse effect' of gases emitted to th e atmosphere, the most important of which is carbon d ioxide (CO2) produced from the combustion of fossil fuels /12 ; urban-industrial air pollution caused by atmospher ic pollutants from the combustion of fossil fuels /13 ; acidification of the environment from the same cau ses /14 ; and the risks of nuclear reactor accidents, the proble ms of waste disposal and dismantling of reactors af ter their service life is over, and the dangers of prol iferation associated with the use of nuclear energy . United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. Along with these, a major problem arises from the g rowing scarcity of fuelwood in developing countries . If trends continue, by the year 2000 around 2.4 billio n people may be living in areas where wood is extre mely scarce. /15 12. These reservations apply at even lower levels o f energy use. A study that proposed energy consumpt ion at only half the levels of Case A (Box 7-2) drew speci al attention to the risks of global warning from CO 2. /16 The study indicated that a realistic fuel mix - a virtu al quadrupling of coal and a doubling of gas use, a long with 1.4 times as much oil - could cause significant global warming by the 2020s. No technology currently exist s to remove CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. T he high coal use would also increase emissions of o xides of sulphur and nitrogen, much of which turns to aci ds in the atmosphere. Technologies to remove these latter emissions are now required in some countries in all new and even some old facilities, but they can inc rease investment costs by 15-25 per cent. /17 If countries are not prepared to incur these expen ses, this path becomes even more infeasible, a limitation that app lies much more to the higher energy futures that re ly to a greater extent on fossil fuels. A near doubling of global primary energy consumption will be difficult without encountering severe economic, social, and environme ntal constraints. Energy is, put most simply, the fundamental unit of the physical world. As such, we cannot conceive of development without changes in the extent or the na ture of energy flows. And because it is so fundamen tal, every one of those changes of flows has environment al implications. The implications of this are profo und. It means that there is no such thing as a simple energ y choice. They are all complex. And they all involv e trade- offs. However, some of the choices and some of the trade-offs appear to be unequivocally better than o thers, in the sense that they offer more development and less environmental damage. David Brooks Friends of the Earth WCED Public Hearings Ottawa, 26-27 May 1986 13. This raises the desirability of a lower energy future, where GDP growth is not constrained but whe re investment effort is switched away from building mo re primary supply sources and put into the developm ent and supply of highly efficient fuel-saving end-use equipment. In this way, the energy services needed by society could be supplied at much reduced levels of primary energy production. Case B in Box 7-2 allow s for a 50 per cent fall in per capita primary energy consu mption in industrial countries and a 30 per cent in crease in developing countries. /18 By using the most energy-efficient technologies an d processes now available in all sectors of the economy, annual global per capita GD P growth rates of around 3 per cent can be achieved . This growth is at least as great as that regarded in thi s report as a minimum for reasonable development. B ut this path would require huge structural changes to allow market penetration of efficient technologies, and it seems unlikely to be fully realizable by most governments during the next 40 years. 14. The crucial point about these lower, energy-eff icient futures is not whether they are perfectly re alisable in their proposed time frames. Fundamental political a nd institutional shifts are required to restructure investment potential in order to move along these lower, more energy-efficient paths. 15. The Commission believes that there is no other realistic option open to the world for the 21st cen tury. The ideas behind these lower scenarios are not fanciful . Energy efficiency has already shown cost-effectiv e results. In many industrial countries, the primary energy re quired to produce a unit of GDP has fallen by as mu ch as a quarter or even a third over the last 13 years, muc h of it from implementing energy efficiency measure s. /19 Properly managed, efficiency measures could allow i ndustrial nations to stabilize their primary energy consumption by the turn of the century. They would also enable developing countries to achieve higher levels of growth with much reduced levels of investment, f oreign debt, and environmental damage. But by the e arly decades of the 21st century they will not alleviate the ultimate need for substantial new energy suppl ies globally. II. Fossil Fuels: The Continuing Dilemma 16. Many forecasts of recoverable oil reserves and resources suggest that oil production will level of f by the early decades of the next century and then graduall y fall during a period of reduced supplies and high er prices. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. Gas supplies should last over 200 years and coal ab out 3.000 years at present rates of use. These esti mates persuade many analysts that the world should immedi ately embark on a vigorous oil conservation policy. 17. In terms of pollution risks, gas is by far the cleanest fuel, with oil next and coal a poor third. But they all pose three interrelated atmospheric pollution probl ems: global warming, /20 urban industrial air pollution, /21 and acidification of the environment. /22 Some of the wealthier industrial countries may pos sess the economic capacity to cope with such threats. Most developing countries do not. 18. These problems are becoming more widespread par ticularly in tropical and subtropical regions, but their economic, social, and political repercussions are a s yet not fully appreciated by society. With the ex ception of CO2, air pollutants can be removed from fossil fuel combustion processes at costs usually below the co sts of damage caused by pollution. /23 However, the risks of global warming make heavy fu ture reliance upon fossil fuels problematic. 1. Managing Climatic change 19. The burning of fossil fuels and, to a lesser ex tent, the loss of vegetative cover, particularly fo rests, through urban-industrial growth increase the accumulation o f CO2 in the atmosphere. The pre-industrial concent ration was about 280 parts of carbon dioxide per million p arts of air by volume. This concentration reached 3 40 in 1980 and is expected to double to 560 between the m iddle and the end of the next century. /24 Other gases also play an important role in this 'greenhouse eff ect', whereby solar radiation is trapped near the g round, warming the globe and changing the climate. 20. After reviewing the latest evidence on the gree nhouse effect in October 1985 at a meeting in Villa ch, Austria, organized by the WMO, UNEP, and ICSU, scie ntists from 29 industrialized and developing countr ies concluded that climate change must be considered a 'plausible and serious probability. They further co ncluded that: 'Many important economic and social decisions are being made today on ... major water resource management activities such as irrigation and hydrop ower; drought relief; agricultural land use; struct ural designs and coastal engineering projects; and energ y planning - all based on the assumption that past climatic data, without modification, are a reliable guide to the future. This is no longer a good assumption'. /25 21. They estimated that if present trends continue, the combined concentration of CO2 and other greenh ouse gases in the atmosphere would be equivalent to a do ubling of CO2 from pre-industrial levels, possibly as early as the 2030s, and could lead to a rise in global me an temperatures 'greater than any in man's history' . /26 Current modelling studies and 'experiments' show a rise in globally averaged surface temperatures, for an effective CO2 doubling, of somewhere between 1.5\u00b0C and 4.5\u00b0C, With the warming becoming more pronounced at higher latitudes during winter than a t the equator. 22. An important concern is that a global temperatu re rise of 1.5-4.5\u00b0C, with perhaps a two to three t imes greater warming at the poles, would lead to a sea l evel rise of 25-140 centimetres. /27 A rise in the upper part of this range would inundate low-lying coastal cities and agricultural areas, and many countries could ex pect their economic, social, and political structures to be se verely disrupted. It would also alow the 'atmospher ic heat- engine', which is driven by the differences between equatorial and polar temperatures, thus influencin g rainfall regimes. /28 Experts believe that crop and forest boundaries wi ll move to higher latitudes; the effects of warmer oceans on marine ecosystems or fisheries and food c hains are also virtually unknown. 23. There is no way to prove that any of this will happen until it actually occurs. The key question i s: How much certainty should governments require before agreein g to take action? If they wait until significant cl imate change is demonstrated, it may be too late for any countermeasures to be effective against the inertia by then stored in this massive global system. The very long time lags involved in negotiating international ag reement on complex issues involving all nations have led some experts to conclude that it is already late. /29 Given the complexities and uncertainties surrounding the issu e, it is urgent that the process start now. A four track strategy is needed, combining: improved monitoring and assessment of the evolving phenomena; increased research to improve knowledge about the origins, mechanisms, and effects of the phenomena; United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. the development of internationally agreed policies for the reduction of the causative gases; and adoption of strategies needed to minimize damage a nd cope with the climate changes, and rising sea level. 24. No nation has either the political mandate or t he economic power to combat climatic change alone. However, the Villach statement recommended such a f our track strategy for climate change, to be promot ed by governments and the scientific community through WM O, UNEP, and ICSU - backed by a global convention i f necessary. /30 It is difficult to imagine an issue with more globa l impacts on human societies and the natural enviro nment than the greenhouse effect. The signal is unclear but we may already be witnessing examples, if not actual greenhouse effects, in Africa. The ultimate potential impacts of a greenhouse warm ing could be catastrophic. It is our considered jud gement that it is already very late to start the process o f policy consideration. The process of heightening public awareness, of building support for national policie s, and finally for developing multilateral efforts to slow the rate of emissions growth will take time to implement. The greenhouse issue is an opportunity as well as a challenge; not surprisingly, it provides another i mportant reason to implement sustainable development strateg ies. Irving Mintzer World Resources Institute WCED Public Hearing Oslo, 24-25 June 1985 25. While these strategies are being developed, mor e immediate policy measures can and should be adopt ed. The most urgent are those required to increase and extend the recent steady gains in energy efficiency and to shift the energy mix more towards renewables. Carbo n dioxide output globally could be significantly re duced by energy efficiency measures without any reduction of the tempo of GDP growth. /31 These measures would also serve to abate other emissions and thus reduce acid ification and urban-industrial air pollution. Gaseo us fuels produce less carbon dioxide per unit of energy outp ut than oil or coal and should be promoted, especia lly for cooking and other domestic uses. 26. Gases other than carbon dioxide are thought to be responsible for about one-third of present globa l warming, and it is estimated that they will cause a bout half the problem around 2030. /32 some of these, notably chlorofluorocarbons used as aerosols, refrigeration chemicals, and in the manufacture of plastics, may be more easily controlled than CO2. These, although not str ictly energy-related, will have a decisive influenc e on policies for managing carbon dioxide emissions. 27. Apart from their climatic effect, chlorofluoroc arbons are responsible to a large extent for damage to the earth's stratospheric ozone. /33 The chemical industry should make every effort to find replacements, and governments should require the use of such replacem ents when found (as some nations have outlawed the use of these chemicals as aerosols). Governments sh ould ratify the existing ozone convention and devel op protocols for the limitation of chlorofluorocarbon emissions, and systematically monitor and report implementation. 28. A lot of policy development work is needed. Thi s should proceed hand in hand with accelerated rese arch to reduce remaining scientific uncertainties. Nations urgently need to formulate and agree upon managemen t policies for all environmentally reactive chemicals released into the atmosphere by human activities, particularly those that can influence the radiation balance on e arth. Governments should initiate discussions leadi ng to a convention on this matter. 29. If a convention on chemical containment policie s cannot be implemented rapidly, governments should develop contingency strategies and plans for adapta tion to climatic change. In either case, WMO, UNEP, WHO, ICSU, and other relevant international and national bodies should be encouraged to coordinate and acce lerate their programmes to develop a carefully integrated strategy of research, monitoring, and assessment of the United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. likely impacts on climate, health, and environment of all environmentally reactive chemicals released into the atmosphere in significant quantities. 2. Reducing Urban-Industrial Air Pollution 30. The past three decades of generally rapid growt h worldwide have seen dramatic increases in fuel consumption for heating and cooling, automobile tra nsport, industrial activities, and electricity gene ration. Concern over the effects of increasing air pollutio n in the late 1960s resulted in the development of curative measures, including air-quality criteria, standards , and add-on control technologies that can remove p ollutants cost-effectively. All these greatly reduced emissio ns of some of the principal pollutants and cleaned air over many cities. Despite this, air pollution has today reached serious levels in the cities of several ind ustrial and newly industrialized countries as well as in those of most developing countries, which in some cases a re by now the world's most polluted urban areas. 31. The fossil fuel emissions of principal concern in terms of urban pollution, whether from stationar y or mobile sources, include sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, various volatile organic compounds , fly ash, and other suspended particles. They can injure human health and the environment, bringing increas ed respiratory complaints, some potentially fatal. But these pollutants can be contained so as to protect human health and the environment and all governments shou ld take steps to achieve acceptable levels of air q uality. 32. Governments can establish and monitor air quali ty goals and objectives, allowable atmospheric load ings, and related emission criteria or standards, as some successfully do already. Regional organizations ca n support this effort. Multilateral and bilateral dev elopment assistance agencies and development banks should encourage governments to require that the most ener gy-efficient technology be used when industries and energy utilities plan to build new or extend existi ng facilities. 3. Damage from the Long-Range Transport of Air Poll ution 33. Measures taken by many industrialized countries in the 1970s to control urban and industrial air p ollution (high chimney stacks, for example) greatly improved the quality of the air in the cities concerned. Ho wever, it quite unintentionally sent increasing amounts of po llution across national boundaries in Europe and No rth America, contributing to the acidification of dista nt environments and creating new pollution problems . This was manifest in growing damage to lakes, soils, and com munities of plants and animals. /34 Failure to control automobile pollution in some regions has seriously contributed to the problem. 34. Thus atmospheric pollution, once perceived only as a local urban-industrial problem involving peop le's health, is now also seen as a much more complex iss ue encompassing buildings, ecosystems, and maybe even public health over vast regions. During transp ort in the atmosphere, emissions of sulphur and nit rogen oxides and volatile hydrocarbons are transformed in to sulphuric and nitric acids, ammonium salts, and ozone. They fall to the ground, sometimes many hundreds or thousands of kilometres from their origins, as dry particles or in rain, snow, frost, fog, and dew. Fe w studied of their socio-economic costs are availab le, but these demonstrate that they are quite large and suggest t hat they are growing rapidly. /35 They damage vegetation, contribute to land and water pollution, and corrode buildings, metallic structures and vehicles, causi ng billions of dollars in damage annually. 35. Damage first became evident in Scandinavia in t he 1960s. Several thousand lakes in Europe, particu larly in southern Scandinavia /36 , and several hundreds in North America /37 have registered a steady increase in acidity levels to the point where their natural fis h populations have declined or died out. The same a cids enter the soil and groundwater, increasing corrosion of d rinking water piping in Scandinavia. /38 36. The circumstantial evidence indicating the need for action on the sources of acid precipitation is mounting with a speed that gives scientists and governments little time to assess it scientifically. Some of th e greatest observed damage has been reported in Central Europe , which is currently receiving more than one gramme of sulphur on every square metre of ground each year, at least five times greater than natural background . /39 There was little evidence of tree damage in Europe in 1970. In 1962, the Federal Republic of Germany r eported visible leaf damage in its forest plot samples nati onwide, amounting in 1983 to 34 per cent, and risin g in 1985 to BO per cent. /40 Sweden reported light to moderate damage in 30 per cent of its forests, and various reports United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. from other countries in Eastern and Western Europe are extremely disquieting. So far an estimated 14 p er cent of all European forestland is affected. /41 37. The evidence is not all in, but many reports sh ow soils in parts of Europe becoming acid throughou t the tree rooting layers, /42 particularly nutrient-poor soils such as those of Southern Sweden /43 The precise damage mechanisms are not known, but all theories include an air pollution component. Root damage /44 and leaf damage appear to interact - affecting the ability o f the trees both to take up water from the soil and to retain it in the foliage, so that they become particularly vulne rable to dry spells and other stresses. Europe may be experiencing an immense change to irreversible acid ification, the remedial costs of which could be bey ond economic reach. /45 (See Box 7-3.) Although there are many options for reducing sulphur, nitrogen, and hydrocarbon emissions, no single pollutant control strategy is likely to be effective in dealing with forest decline. It will require a total integrated mix of strategie s and technologies to improve air quality, tailored for each region. A forest in an ecosystem that exists under certain environmental conditions, and if you change the con ditions, the system is going to change. It is a very difficu lt task for ecologists to foresee what changes are going to be because the systems are so enormously complex. The direct causes behind an individual tree dying c an be far removed from the primary pressure that br ought the whole system into equilibrium. One time it migh t be ozone, another time it may be SO2, a third tim e it may be aluminium poisoning. I can express myself by an analogy: If there is fam ine, there are relatively few people who die direct ly from starvation: they die from dysentery or various infe ctious diseases. And in such a situation, it is not of very much help to send medicine instead of food. That means t hat in this situation, it is necessary to address t he primary pressures against the ecosystem. Alf Johnels Swedish Museum of Natural History WCED Public Hearing Oslo, 24-25 June 1985 38. Evidence of local air pollution and acidificati on in Japan and also in the newly industrialized co untries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America is beginning to eme rge. China and the Republic of Korea seem particula rly vulnerable, as do Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Ve nezuela. So little is known about the likely enviro nmental loading of sulphur and nitrogen in these region and about the acid-neutralizing capacity of tropical l akes and forest soils that a comprehensive programme of inve stigation should be formulated without delay. /46 39. Where actual or potential threats from acidific ation exist, governments should map sensitive areas , assess forest damage annually and soil impoverishment ever y five years according to regionally agreed protoco ls, and publish the findings. They should support transboun dary monitoring of pollution being carried out by a gencies in their region and, where there is no such agency, cr eate one or give the job to any suitable regional b ody. Governments in many regions could gain significantl y from early agreement to prevent transboundary air pollution and the enormous damage to their economic base now being experienced in Europe and North America. Even though the exact causes of the damage are hard to prove, reduction strategies are certai nly within reach and economic. They could be viewed as a cheap insurance policy compared with the vast amo unt of potential damage these strategies avoid. Box 7-3 The Damage and Control Costs of Air Polluti on It is very difficult to quantify damage control cos ts, not least because cost figures are highly depen dent on the control strategy assumed. However, in the eastern U nited States, it has been estimated that halving th e remaining sulphur dioxide emissions from existing s ources would cost $5 billion a year, increasing pre sent electricity rates by 2-3 per cent. If nitrogen oxid es are figured in, the additional costs might be as high as $6 billion a year. Materials corrosion damage alone is estimated to cost $7 billion annually in 17 states in the eastern United states. Estimates of the annual costs of securing a 55 to 6 5 per cent reduction in the remaining sulphur emiss ions in the countries of the European Economic Community be tween 1980 and 2000 range from $4.6 billion to $6.7 United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. billion (1982 dollars) per year. Controls on statio nary boilers to reduce nitrogen levels by only 10 p er cent annually by the year 2000 range between $100,000 an d $400,000 (1982 dollars). These figures translate into a one-time increase of about 6 per cent in the price of electrical power to the consumer. Studies place damage costs due to material and fish losses alone at $3 b illion a year, while damage to crops, forests, and health are estimated to exceed $10 billion per year. Technolog ies for drastically reducing oxides of nitrogen and hydrocarbons from automobile exhaust gases are read ily available and routinely used in North America a nd Japan, but not in Europe. Japanese laboratory studies indicate that air pollu tion and acid rain can reduce some wheat and rice c rop production, perhaps by as much as 30 per cent.

The Peaceful Atom 40. In the years following the Second World War, th e nuclear knowledge that under military control had led to the production of atomic weapons was redeployed for peaceful 'energy' purposes by civilian technologis ts. Several benefits were obvious at the time. 41. It was also realized that no energy source woul d ever be risk-free. There was the danger of nuclea r war, the spread of atomic weapons, and nuclear terrorism. Bu t intensive international cooperation and a number of negotiated agreements suggested that these dangers could be avoided. For instance, the Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), drafted in its final form in 1969, included a promise by signatory governments possessing nucl ear weapons and expertise to pursue and undertake nucle ar disarmament ad also to assist the non-nuclear signatories in developing nuclear power, but strict ly for peaceful purposes only. Other problems, such as radiation risks, reactor safety, and nuclear waste disposal were all acknowledged as very important bu t, with the right amount of effort, containable. 42. And now, after almost four decades of immense t echnological effort to support nuclear development, nuclear energy has become widely used. Some 30 gove rnments produce from nuclear generators a total of about 15 per cent of all the electricity used globa lly. Yet it has not met earlier expectations that i t would be the key to ensuring an unlimited supply of low-cost ene rgy. However, during this period of practical exper ience with building and running nuclear reactors, the nature o f the costs, risks and benefits have become much mo re evident and as such, the subject of sharp controver sy. 2. The Growing Understanding of Nuclear Issues 43. The potential for the spread of nuclear weapons is one of the most serious threats to world peace. It is in the interest of all nations to prevent proliferatio n of nuclear weapons. All nations therefore should contribute to the development of a viable non-proliferation regim e. The nuclear weapon states must deliver on their promise to reduce the number and ultimately eliminate nucle ar weapons in their arsenals and the role those wea pons play in their strategies. And the non-nuclear-weapo n states must cooperate in providing credible assur ances that they are not moving towards a nuclear weapon c apability. The health risks for the development of peaceful us es of nuclear technology, including nuclear electri city, are very small when compared with the benefits from the use of nuclear radiation for medical diagnosis tre atment. The safe application of nuclear radiation technolog y promises many benefits in environmental clean-up and in increasing world food supplies by eliminating spoil age. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. With a recent and very notable exception, the inter national cooperation that has marked the developmen t of nuclear power technology provides an excellent mode l by which to address common environmental and ethi cal problems posed by the development of other technolo gies. Ian Wilson Vice-President, Canadian Nuclear Association WCED Public Hearing Ottawa, 26-27 May 1986 44. Most schemes for non-proliferation mandate an i nstitutional separation between military and civili an uses of nuclear energy. But for countries with full access to the complete nuclear fuel cycle, no technical se paration really exists. Not all states operate the necessary clear-cut administrative separation of civilian an d military access. Cooperation is needed also among suppliers and buyers of civilian nuclear facilities and mater ials and the International Atomic Energy Agency, in order to provide credible safeguards against the diversion of civilian reactor programmes to military purposes, especially in countries that do not open all their nuclear pr ogrammes to IAEA inspection. Thus, there still remains a dan ger of the proliferation of nuclear weapons. 2.1 Costs 45. The costs of construction and the relative econ omics of electricity generating stations - whether powered by nuclear energy, coal, oil or gas - are conditioned by the following factors throughout the service lif e of a plant: the cost of borrowing money to finance plant const ruction, the impact of inflation; the duration of the period of planning, licensing, and construction; the cost of fuel and maintenance ; the costs of protective measures, to ensure safe o peration; and waste disposal costs (land, air, and water polluti on containment) and the costs of dismantling at the end of service life. 46. All these factors vary widely depending on diff ering institutional, legal, and financial arrangeme nts in different countries. Cost generalizations and compa risons are therefore unhelpful or misleading. Howev er, costs associated with several of these factors have increased more rapidly for nuclear stations during the last 5-10 years, so that the earlier clear cost advantag e of nuclear over the service life of the plant has been reduced or lost altogether. /47 Nations should therefore look very closely at cost comparisons to obtain the best value when choosing an energy path. 2.2 Health and Environment Risks 47. Very strict codes of safety practice are implem ented in nuclear plants so that under officially ap proved operating conditions, the danger from radiation to reactor personnel and especially to the general pub lic is negligible. However, an accident occurring in a rea ctor may in certain very rare canes be serious enou gh to cause an external release of radioactive substances . Depending upon the level of exposure, people are under a certain level of risk of becoming ill from variou s forms of cancer or from alteration or genetic mat erial, which may result in hereditary defects. 48. Since 1928, the International Commission on Rad iological Protection (ICRP) has issued recommendati ons on radiation dosage levels above which exposure is unacceptable. These have been developed for occupationally exposed workers and for the general public. The 'Nuclear Safety Standards (NUSS) codes of IAEA were developed in 1975 to reduce safety differ ences among member states. Neither system is in any way binding on governments, if an accident occurs, indi vidual governments have the responsibility of decid ing at United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. what level of radioactive contamination pasture lan d, drinking water, milk, meat, eggs, vegetables, an d fish, are to be banned for consumption by livestock or humans . 49. Different countries - even different local gove rnment authorities within a country - have differen t criteria. Some have none at all, ICRP and NUSS notwithstandin g. States with more rigorous standards may destroy large amounts of food or may ban food imports from a neighbour states with more permissive criteria. T his causes great hardship to farmers who may not receiv e any compensation for their losses. It may also ca use trade problems and political tension between states . Both of these difficulties occurred following the Chernobyl disaster, when the need to develop at least regiona lly conformable contamination criteria and compensa tion arrangements was overwhelmingly demonstrated. 2.3 Nuclear Accidents Risks 50. Nuclear safety returned to the newspaper headli nes following the Three Mile Island (Harrisburg, Un ited States) and the Chernobyl (USSR) accidents. Probabi listic estimates of the risks of component failure, leading to a radioactive release in Western style light wat er reactors wore made in 1975 by the U.S. Nuclear R egulatory Commission. /48 The most serious category of release through conta inment failure was placed at around 1 in 1,000,000 years of reactor operation. Post-accident analysis of both Harrisburg and Chernobyl - a comp letely different type of reactor - have shown that in both cases, human operator error was the main cause. Th ey occurred after about 2,000 and 4,000 reactor-years respectively. /49 The frequencies of such occurrences are well nigh impossible to estimate probabilistically. However, available analyses indicate that although the risk of a radioactive release accident is small, it is by n o means negligible for reactor operations at the pr esent time. 51. The regional health and environment effects of an accident are largely predictable from radioactiv e fall-out studies following early atomic weapons testing in t he atmosphere and have been confirmed in practice following the Chernobyl accident. What could not be confidently predicted before Chernobyl were the lo cal effects of such an accident. A much clearer picture is now emerging as a result of the experiences the re when a reactor exploded, following a series of infringem ents of the official safety regulations, on 26 Apri l 1986, causing the worst reactor accident ever experienced . As a result, the whole district had to be managed on something like a 'war footing' and efforts resembli ng a large military operation were needed to contai n the damage. 2.4 Radioactive Waste Disposal 52. Civil nuclear energy programmes worldwide have already generated many thousands of tons of spent f uel and high-level waste. Many governments have embarke d on large-scale programmes to develop ways of isolating these from the biosphere for the many hun dreds of thousands of years that they will remain hazardously radioactive. 53. But the problem of nuclear waste disposal remai ns unsolved. Nuclear waste technology has reached a n advanced level of sophistication. /50 This technology has not however been fully tested or utilized and problems remain about disposal. There is particular concern about future recourse to ocean dumping and the disp osal of contaminated waste in the territories of small or p oor states that lack the capacity to impose strict safeguards. There should be a clear presumption that all countr ies that generate nuclear waste dispose of it withi n their own territories or under strictly monitored agreements between states. 3. The Current International Situation 54. During the last 25 years, a growing awareness o f the difficulties outlined above has resulted in a wide range of reactions from technical experts, the public, an d governments. Many experts still feel that so much can be learned from the problems experienced up to now. Th ey argue that if the public climate allows then to solve the nuclear waste disposal and decommissioning issues a nd the cost of borrowing money remains reasonably below its 1980-82 peak, in the absence of viable ne w supply alternatives there is no reason why nuclea r energy should not emerge as a strong runner in the 1990s. At the other extreme, many experts take the view th at there are so many unsolved problems and too many risks fo r society to continue with a nuclear future. Public reactions also vary. Some countries have exhibited little public reaction, in others there appears to be a high United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. level of anxiety that expresses itself in anti-nucl ear results in public opinion polls or large anti-n uclear campaigns. Today the assessment of practical consequences can be based on practical experience. The consequences of Chernobyl has made Soviet specialists once again po se a question: Is not the development of nuclear en ergy on an industrial scale premature? Will it not be fa tal to our civilization, to the ecosystem of our pl anet? On our planet so rich in all sorts of energy sources, this question can be discussed quite calmly. We have a real choice in this, both on a state and a governmental level, and also on the level of individuals and profession als. We must put all our efforts to improve the technolo gy itself, to develop and elaborate strict standard s and norms of quality, of safety of a technology. We mus t work for the creation of anti-accident centres an d centres devoting themselves to compensating for the losses to the environment. The upgrading of the industrial level of safety and the solution of the problem of the relat ions between man and machine would be a lot more na tural thing to do than concentrating the efforts on only one element of the energy structure in the world. T his would benefit the whole of humanity. V. A. Legasov Member, Academy of Sciences of the USSR WCED Public Hearing Moscow, 8 Dec 1986 55. And so, whilst some states still remain nuclear -free, today nuclear reactors supply about 15 per c ent of all the electricity generated. Total electricity produc tion worldwide is in turn equivalent to around 15 p er cent of global primary energy supply. Roughly one-quarter o f all countries worldwide have reactors. In 1986, t here were 366 working and a further 140 planned, /51 with 10 governments possessing about 90 per cent o f all installed capacity (more than 5 GW (e)). Of these, there are 8 with a total capacity of more than 9 GW (e), /52 which provided the following percentages of electri c power in 1985: France, 65; Sweden, 42; Federal Re public of Germany, 31; Japan, 23; United Kingdom, 19; Unit ed States, 16; Canada, 13; and USSR, 10. According to IAEA, in 1985 there were 55 research reactors world wide, 33 of them in developing countries. /53 56. Nevertheless, there is little doubt that the di fficulties referred to above have in one way or ano ther contributed to a scaling back of future nuclear pla ns - in some countries, to a de facto nuclear pause . In Western Europe and North America, which today have almost 75 per cent of current world capacity, nucle ar provides about one-third of the energy that was for ecast for it 10 years ago. Apart from France, Japan , the USSR, and several other East European countries tha t have decided to continue with their nuclear programmes, ordering, construction, and licensing p rospects for new reactors in many other countries l ook poor. In fact, between 1972 and 1986, earlier globa l projections of estimated capacity for the year 20 00 have been revised downwards by a factor of nearly seven. Despite this, the growth of nuclear at around 15 p er cent a year over the last 20 years is still impressive. /54 57. Following Chernobyl, there were significant cha nges in the nuclear stance of certain governments. Several - notably China, the Federal Republic of Germany, Fra nce, Japan, Poland, United Kingdom, United States, and the USSR - have maintained or reaffirmed their pro- nuclear policy. Others with a 'no nuclear' or a 'ph ase-out' policy (Australia, Austria, Denmark, Luxembourg, Ne w Zealand, Norway, Sweden - and Ireland with an unofficial anti-nuclear position) have been joined by Greece and the Philippines. Meanwhile, Finland, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Yugoslavia are re-inv estigating nuclear safety and/or the anti-nuclear arguments, or have introduced legislation tying any further growth of nuclear energy and export/import of nuclear reactor technology to a satisfactory soluti on of the problem of disposal of radioactive wastes . Several countries have been concerned enough to conduct ref erenda to test public opinion regarding nuclear pow er. 4. Conclusions and Recommendations 58. These national reactions indicate that as they continue to review and update all the available evi dence, governments tend to take up three possible position s: remain non-nuclear and develop other sources of en ergy: United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. regard their present nuclear power capacity as nec essary during a finite period of transition, to saf er alternative energy sources; or adopt and develop nuclear energy with the convicti on that the associated problems and risks can and must, be solved with a level of safety that is both nationally and internationally acceptable. The discussion in the Commission also reflected the se tendencies, views, and positions. 59. But whichever policy is adopted, it is importan t that the vigorous promotion of energy-efficient p ractices in all energy sectors and large-scale programmes of re search, development, and demonstration for the safe and environmentally benign use of all promising energy sources, especially renewables, be given the highes t, priority. 60. Because of potential transboundary effects, it is essential that governments cooperate to develop internationally agreed codes of practice covering t echnical, economic, social (including health and en vironment aspects), and political components of nuclear energ y. In particular, international agreement must be r eached on the following specific items: full governmental ratification of the conventions on 'Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident' (incl uding the development of an appropriate surveillance and moni toring system) and on 'Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency' as rece ntly developed by IAEA; emergency response training - for accident contain ment and for decontamination and long-term clean-up of affected sites, personnel, and ecosystems; the transboundary movement of all radioactive mate rials - including fuels, spent fuels, and other was tes by land, sea, or air; a code of practice on liability and compensation; standards for operator training and international licensing; codes of practice for reactor operation, including minimum safety standards; the reporting of routine and accidental discharges from nuclear installations; effective, internationally harmonized minimum radi ological protection standards; agreed site selection criteria as well as consulta tion and notification prior to the siting of all ma jor civil nuclear - related installations; standards for waste repositories; standards for the decontamination and dismantling of time-expired nuclear reactors; and problems posed by the development of nuclear power ed shipping. 61. For many reasons, especially including the fail ure of the nuclear weapons states to agree on disar mament, the Nonproliferation Treaty has not proved to be a sufficient instrument to pr event the proliferation of nuclear weapons, which still remains a serious danger to wo rld peace. We therefore recommend in the strongest terms the construction of an effective international regi me covering all dimensions of the problem. Both nuc lear weapons states and non nuclear weapons states, shou ld undertake to accept safeguards in accordance wit h the statutes of IAEA. 62. Additionally, an international regulatory funct ion is required, including inspection of reactors i nternationally. This should be quite separate from the role of IAEA in promoting nuclear energy. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 63. The generation of nuclear power is only justifi able if there are solid solutions to the presently unsolved problems to which it gives rise. The highest priori ty must be accorded to research and development on environmentally sound and economically viable alter natives, as well as on means of increasing the safe ty of nuclear energy. IV. Wood Fuels: The Vanishing Resource 64. Seventy per cent of the people in developing co untries use wood and, depending on availability, bu rn anywhere between an absolute minimum of about 350 k ilogrammes to 2,900 kilogrammes of dry wood annually, with the average being around 700 kilogra mmes per person. /55 Rural woodfuel supplies appear to be steadily collapsing in many developing countries, e specially in Sub-Saharan Africa. /56 At the same time, the rapid growth of agriculture, the pace of migration to cities, and the growing numbers of people enteri ng the money economy are placing unprecedented pressures o n the biomass base /57 and increasing the demand for commercial fuels: from wood and charcoal to kerosen e, liquid propane, gas, and electricity. To cope wi th this, many developing country governments have no option but to immediately organize their agriculture to pr oduce large quantities of wood and other plant fuels. 65. Wood is being collected faster than it can regr ow in many developing countries that still rely pre dominantly on biomass wood, charcoal, dung, and crop residues - for cooking, for heating their dwellings, and eve n for lighting. FAO estimates suggest that in 1900, aroun d 1.3 billion people lived in wood-deficit areas. /58 If this population-driven overharvesting continues at prese nt rates, by the year 2000 some 2.4 billion people may be living in areas where wood is 'acutely scarce or ha s to be obtained elsewhere'. These figures reveal g reat human hardship. Precise data on supplies are unavai lable because much of the wood is not commercially traded but collected by the users, principally wome n and children, but there is no doubt that millions are hard put to find substitute fuels, and their numbers are growing. 66. The fuelwood crisis and deforestation - althoug h related are not the same problems. Wood fuels des tined for urban and industrial consumers do tend to come from forests. But only a small proportion of that u sed by the rural poor comes from forests. Even in these cases, villagers rarely chop down trees; most collect dea d branches or cut them from trees. /59 67. When fuelwood is in short supply, people normal ly economize; when it is no longer available, rural people are forced to burn such fuels as cow dung, crop ste ms and husks, and weeds. Often this does no harm, s ince waste products such as cotton stalks are used. But the burning of dung and certain crop residues may i n some cases rob the soil of needed nutrients. Eventually extreme fuel shortages can reduce the number of coo ked meals and shorten the cooking time, which increases malnourishment. 68. Many urban people rely on wood, and most of thi s is purchased. Recently, as the price of wood fuel s has been rising, poor families have been obliged to spe nd increasing proportions of their income on wood. In Addis Ababa and Maputo, families may spend a third to hal f of their incomes this way. /60 Much work has been done over the past 10 years to develop fuel-efficient st oves, and some of these new models use 30-50 per ce nt less fuel. These, as well as aluminium cooking pots and pressure cookers that also use much less fuel, shou ld be made more widely available in urban areas. Fuelwood and charcoal are, and will remain, the maj or sources of energy for the great majority of rura l people in developing countries. The removal of trees in bo th semiarid and humid land in African countries is a result to a large extent of increasing V. Renewable Energy: The Untapped Potential 73. Renewable energy sources could in theory provid e 10-13TW annually - equal to current global energy consumption. /63 Today they provide about 2TW annually, about 21 pe r cent of the energy consumed worldwide, of which 15 per cent is biomass and 6 pe r cent hydropower. However, most of the biomass is in the form of fuelwood and agricultural and animal wastes . As noted above, fuelwood can no longer be thought of as a 'renewable' resource in many areas, because consu mption rater have overtaken sustainable yields. 74. Although worldwide reliance on all these source s has been growing by more than 10 per cent a year since the late 1970s, it will be some time before they ma ke up a substantial portion of the world's energy b udget. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. Renewable energy systems are still in a relatively primitive stage of development. But they offer the world potentially huge primary energy sources, sustainabl e in perpetuity and available in one form or anothe r to every nation on Earth. But it, will require a substantial and sustained commitment to further research and development if their potential is to be realized. 75. Wood as a renewable energy source is usually th ought of as naturally occurring trees and shrubs ha rvested for local domestic use. Wood, however, is becoming an important feedstock, specially grown for advance d energy conversion processes in developing as well a s industrial countries for the product ion of proce ss heat, electricity, and potentially for other fuels, such as combustible gases and liquids. 76. Hydropower, second to wood among the renewables , has been expanding at nearly 4 per cent annually. Although hundreds of thousands of megawatts of hydr opower have been harnessed throughout the world, th e remaining potential is huge. /64 In neighbouring developing countries, interstate c ooperation in hydropower development could revolutionize supply potential es pecially in Africa. In the choice of resources to be utilized we should not stare at renewable resources of energy blindly , we should not blow it out of proportion, we should not promote it for the sake of the environment per se. Instead we should develop and utilize all resources available, renewable sources of energy included, as a long-te rm endeavour requiring a continuous and sustained effo rt that will not be subject to short-term economic fluctuations, in order that we, in Indonesia, will achieve a successful and orderly transition to a mo re diversified and balanced structure of energy supply and environ mentally sound energy supply system, which is the ultimate goal of our policy. Speaker from the floor WCED Public Hearings Jakarta, 26 March 1985 77. Solar energy use is small globally, but it is b eginning to assume an important place in the energy consumption patterns of some countries. Solar water and household heating is widespread in many parts of Australia, Greece, and the Middle East. A number of East European and developing countries have active solar energy programmes, and the United States and Japan support solar sales of several hundred million doll ars a year. With constantly improving solar thermal and s olar electric technologies, it is likely that their contribution will increase substantially. The cost of photovolta ic equipment has fallen from around $500-600 per pe ak watt to $5 and is approaching the $1-2 level where it ca n compete with conventional electricity production. /65 But even at $5 per peak watt, it still provides electri city to remote places more cheaply than building po wer lines. 78. Wind power has been used for centuries - mainly for pumping water. Recently its use has been growi ng rapidly in regions such as California and Scandinav ia. In these cases the wind turbines are used to ge nerate electricity for the local electricity grid. The cos ts of wind-generated electricity, which benefited i nitially from substantial tax incentives, have fallen dramaticall y in California in the last five years and may poss ibly be competitive with other power generated there within a decade. /66 Many countries have successful but small wind programmes, but the untapped potential is stil l high. 79. The fuel alcohol programme in Brazil produced a bout 10 billion litres of ethanol from sugar-cane i n 1984 and replaced about 60 per cent of the gasoline that would have been required. /67 The cost has been estimated at $50-60 per barrel of gasoline replaced. When sub sidies are removed, and a true exchange rate is use d, this is competitive at 1981 oil prices. With present low er oil prices, the programme has become uneconomica l. But it saves the nation hard currency, and it provides the additional benefits of rural development, employme nt generation, increased self-reliance, and reduced vu lnerability to crises in the world oil markets. 80. The use of geothermal energy, from natural unde rground heat sources, has been increasing at more t han 15 per cent per year in both industrial and develop ing countries. The experience gained during the pas t decades could provide the basis for a major expansi on of geothermal-capacity. /68 By contrast, technologies for low-grade heat via heat pumps or from solar ponds a nd ocean thermal gradients are promising but still mostly at the research and development stage. 81. These energy sources are not without their heal th and environment risks. Although they range from rather trivial to very serious problems, public reactions to them are not necessarily in proportion to the da mage United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. sustained. For instance, some of the commonest diff iculties with solar energy are, somewhat surprising ly, the injuries from roof falls during solar thermal maint enance and the nuisance of sun-glare off their glas s surfaces. Or a modern wind turbine can be a significant noise nuisance to people living nearby. Yet, these appar ently small problems often arouse very strong public reac tions. 82. But these are still minor issues compared with the ecosystem destruction at hydropower sites or th e uprooting of homesteads in the areas to be flooded, as well as the health risks from toxic gases gener ated by rotting submerged vegetation and soils, or from wat erborne diseases such as schistosomiasis (snail fev er). Hydrodams also act as an important barrier to fish migration and frequently to the movement of land an imals. Perhaps the worst problem they pose is the danger o f catastrophic rupture of the dam-wall and the swee ping away or flooding of human settlements downstream - about once a year somewhere in the world. This risk is small but not insignificant. 83. One of the most widespread chronic problems is the eye and lung irritation caused by woodsmoke in developing countries. When agricultural wastes are burned, pesticide residues inhaled from the dusts o r smoke of the crop material can be a health problem. Moder n biofuel liquids have their own special hazards. A part from competing with food crops for good agricultural lan d, their production generates large quantities of o rganic waste effluent, which if not used as a fertilizer c an cause serious water pollution. Such fuels, parti cularly methanol, may produce irritant or toxic combustion products. All these and many other problems, both l arge and small, will increase as renewable energy system s are developed. 84. Most renewable energy systems operate best at s mall to medium scales, ideally suited for rural and suburban applications. They are also generally labo ur-intensive, which should be an added benefit wher e there if surplus labour. They are less susceptible than f ossil fuels to wild price fluctuations and foreign exchange costs. Most countries have some renewable resources , and their use can help nations move towards self- reliance. 85. The need for a steady transition to a broader a nd more sustainable mix of energy sources is beginn ing to become accepted. Renewable energy sources could con tribute substantially to this, particularly with ne w and improved technologies, but their development will d epend in the short run on the reduction or removal of certain economic and institutional constraints to their use . These are formidable in many countries. The high level of hidden subsidies for conventional fuels built into the legislative and energy programmes of most count ries distorts choices against renewables in research and development, depletion allowances, tax write-offs, and direct support of consumer prices. Countries should undertake a full examination of all subsidies and other forms of support to various sources of energy and r emove those that are not clearly justified. 86. Although the situation is changing rapidly in s ome jurisdictions, electrical utilities in most hav e a supply monopoly on generation that allows them to arrange pricing policies that discriminate against other, u sually small, suppliers. /69 In some countries a relaxation of this control, re quiring utilities to accept power generated by industry, small systems, and individuals, has cr eated opportunities for the development of renewabl es. Beyond that, requiring utilities to adopt an end-us e approach in planning, financing, developing, and marketing energy can open the door to a wide range of energy- saving measures as well as renewables. 87. Renewable energy sources require a much higher priority in national energy programmes. Research, development, and demonstration projects should comm and funding necessary to ensure their rapid development and demonstration. With a potential of 10TW or so, even if 3-4TW were realized, it would m ake a crucial difference to future primary supply, especi ally in developing countries, where the background conditions exist for the success of renewables. The technologi cal challenges of renewables are minor compared wit h the challenge of creating the social and institutional frameworks that will ease these sources into energy supply systems. 88. The Commission believes that every effort shoul d be made to develop the potential for renewable en ergy, which should form the foundation of the global ener gy structure during the 21st Century. A much more concerted effort must be mounted if this potential is to be realized. But a major programme of renewab le energy development will involve large costs and high risks , particularly massive-scale solar and biomass indu stries. Developing countries lack the resources to finance all but a small fraction of this cost although they will be important users and possibly even exporters. Large- scale financial and technical assistance will there fore be required.

VI. Energy Efficiency: Maintaining the Momentum 89. Given the above analysis, the Commission believ es that energy efficiency should be the cutting edg e of national energy policies for sustainable developmen t. Impressive gains in energy efficiency have been made since the first oil price shock in the 1970s. Durin g the past 13 years, many industrial countries saw the energy content of growth fall significantly as a result of increases in energy efficiency averaging 1.7 per c ent annually between 1973 and 1983. /70 And this energy efficiency solution costs less, by savings made on the extra primary supplies required to run traditional equipm ent. 90. The cost-effectiveness of 'efficiency' as the m ost environmentally benign 'source' of energy is we ll established. The energy consumption per unit of out put from the most efficient processes and technolog ies is one-third to less than one-half that of typically a vailable equipment. /71 91. This is true of appliances for cooking, lightin g and refrigeration, and space cooling and heating - needs that are growing rapidly in most countries and putting s evere pressures on the available supply systems. It is also true of agricultural cultivation and irrigation sys tems, of the automobile, and of many industrial pro cesses and equipment. 92. Given the large disproportion in per capita ene rgy consumption between developed and developing countries in general, it is clear that the scope an d need for energy saving is potentially much higher in industrial than in developing countries. Nonetheless, energy e fficiency is important everywhere. The cement facto ry, automobile, or irrigation pump in a poor country is fundamentally no different from its equivalent in the rich world. In both, there is roughly the same scope for reducing the energy consumption or peak power dema nd of these devices without loss of output or welfare. Bu t poor countries will gain much more from such redu ctions. 93. The woman who cooks in an earthen pot over an o pen fire uses perhaps eight times more energy than an affluent neighbour with a gas stove and aluminium p ans. The poor who light their homes with a wick dip ped in a jar of kerosene get one-fiftieth of the illuminatio n of a 100-watt electric bulb, but use just as much energy. These examples illustrate the tragic paradox of pov erty. For the poor, the shortage of money is a grea ter limitation than the shortage of energy. They are fo rced to use 'free' fuels and inefficient equipment because they do not have the cash or savings to purchase en ergy-efficient fuels and end-use devices. Consequen tly, collectively they pay much more for a unit of deliv ered energy services. 94. In most cases, investments in improved end-use technologies save money over time through lowered energy-supply needs The costs of improving the end- use equipment is frequently much less than the cost of building more primary supply capacity. In Brazil, f or example, it has been shown that for a discounted total investment of $4 billion in more efficient end-use technologies (such as more efficient refrigerators, street- lighting, or motors) it would be feasible to defer construction of 21 gigawatts of new electrical supp ly capacity, corresponding to a discounted capital savings for n ew supplies of $19 billion in the period 1986 to 20 00. /72 We must change our attitude towards consumption goo ds in developed countries and we must create technological advances that will allow us to carry on economic development using less energy. We must ask ourselves can we solve the problems of underdevelop ment without using or increasing the tremendous amo unt of energy used by these countries. The idea that developing countries use very little energy is an incorrect idea. We find that the poore st countries of all have a different problem; their problem is i nefficient use of energy. Medium countries such as Brazil use more efficient and modern sources of fuel. The grea t hope for these countries is that the future will be built not based on technologies of the past, but using advanc ed technology. This will allow them to leap forward in relation to countries that are already developed. Jose Goldemberg President, Companhia Energetica de Sao Paulo WCED Public Hearing Brasilia, 30 Oct 1985 95. There are many examples of successful energy ef ficiency programmes in industrial countries. The ma ny methods used successfully to increase awareness inc lude information campaigns in the media, technical press, and schools; demonstrations of successful practices and technologies; free energy audits; energy 'labe lling' of United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. appliances; and training in energy-saving technique s. These should be quickly and widely extended. Industrialized countries account for such a large p roportion of global energy consumption that even sm all gains in efficiency can have a substantial impact on cons erving reserves and reducing the pollution load on the biosphere. It is particularly important that consum ers, especially large commercial and industrial age ncies, obtain professional audits of their energy use. Thi s kind of energy 'book-keeping' will readily identi fy those places in their consumption patterns where signific ant savings can be made. 96. Energy pricing policies play a critical role in stimulating efficiency. At present, they sometimes include subsidies and seldom reflect the real costs of prod ucing or importing the energy, particularly when ex change rates are undervalued. Very rarely do they reflect the external damage costs to health, property, and the environment. Countries should evaluate all hidden a nd overt subsidies to see how far real energy costs can be passed on to the consumer. The true economic pricin g of energy - with safeguards for the very poor - n eeds to be extended in all countries. Large numbers of coun tries both industrial and developing are already ad opting such policies. 97. Developing countries face particular constraint s in saving energy. Foreign exchange difficulties c an make it hard to purchase efficient but costly energy conver sion and end-use devices. Energy can often be saved cost- effectively by fine-tuning already functioning syst ems. /73 But governments and aid agencies may find it less attractive to fund such measures than to invest in new large-scale energy supply hardware that is perc eived as a more tangible symbol of progress. 98. The manufacture, import, or sale of equipment c onforming to mandatory minimal energy consumption o r efficiency standards is one of the most powerful an d effective tools in promoting energy efficiency an d producing predictable savings. International cooper ation may be required when such equipment is traded from nation to nation. Countries and appropriate regiona l organizations should introduce and extend increas ingly strict efficiency standards for equipment and manda tory labelling of appliances. 99. Many energy efficiency measures cost nothing to implement. But where investments are needed, they are frequently a barrier to poor households and small-s cale consumers, even when pay-back times are short. In these latter cases, special small loan or hire-purc hase arrangements are helpful. Where investment cos ts are not insurmountable, there are many possible mechani sms for reducing or spreading the initial investmen t, such as loans with favourable repayment periods and 'inv isible' measures such as loans repaid by topping up the new, reduced energy bills to the pre-conservation l evels. 100. Transport has a particularly important place i n national energy and development planning. It is a major consumer of oil, accounting for 50-60 per cent of t otal petroleum use in most developing countries. /74 It is often a major source of local air pollution and regional acidification of the environment in industrial and developing countries. Vehicle markets will grow much more rapi dly in developing countries, adding greatly to urba n air pollution, which in many cities already exceeds int ernational norms. Unless strong action is taken, ai r pollution could become a major factor limiting industrial dev elopment in many Third World cities. 101. In the absence of higher fuel prices, mandator y standards providing for a steady increase in fuel economy may be necessary. Either way, the potential for sub stantial future gains in fuel economy is enormous. If momentum can be maintained, the current average fue l consumption of approximately 10 litres per 100 kilometres in the fleet of vehicles in use in indus trial countries could be cut in half by the turn of the century. /75 102. A key issue is how developing countries can ra pidly improve the fuel economy of their vehicles wh en these are, on average, used for twice as long those as in industrial countries, cutting rates of renew al and improvement in half. Licensing and import agreement s should be reviewed to ensure access to the best available fuel efficient designs and production pro cesses. Another important fuel-saving strategy espe cially in the growing cities of developing countries is the o rganizing of carefully planned public transport sys tems. 103. Industry accounts for 40 60 pet cent of all en ergy consumed in industrial countries and 10-40 per cent in developing countries. (See Chapter 6 .) There has been significant improvement in the en ergy efficiency of production equipment, processes, and products. In d eveloping countries, energy savings of as much as 2 0-30 per cent could be achieved by such skilful manageme nt of industrial development. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 104. Agriculture worldwide is only a modest energy consumer, accounting for about 3.5 per cent of comm ercial energy use in the industrial countries and 4.5 per cent in developing countries as a whole. /76 A strategy to double food production in the Third World through i ncreases in fertilizers, irrigation, and mechanizat ion would add 140 million tons of oil equivalent to their agr icultural energy use. This is only some 5 per cent of present world energy consumption and almost certainly a sma ll part of the energy that could be saved in other sectors in the developing world through appropriate efficie ncy measures. /77 105. Buildings offer enormous scope for energy savi ngs, and perhaps the most widely understood ways of increasing energy efficiency are in the home and wo rkplace. Buildings in the tropics are now commonly designed to avoid as much direct solar heating as p ossible by having very narrow east- and west-facing walls, but with long sides facing north and south and prot ected from the overhead sun by recessed windows or wide sills. 106. An important method of heating buildings is by hot water produced during electricity production a nd piped around whole districts, providing both heat and hot water. This extremely efficient use of fossil fuel s demands a coordination of energy supply with local physical p lanning, which few countries are institutionally eq uipped to handle. /78 Where it has been successful, there has usually be en local authority involvement in or control of regional energy-services boards, such as in Scandin avia and the USSR. Given the development of these o r similar institutional arrangements, the cogeneratio n of heat and electricity could revolutionize the e nergy efficiency of buildings worldwide. VII. Energy Conservation Measures 107. There is general agreement that the efficiency gains achieved by some industrialized countries ov er the past 13 years were driven largely by higher energy prices, triggered by higher oil prices. Prior to th e recent fall in oil prices, energy efficiency was growing at a r ate of 2.0 per cent annually in some countries, hav ing increased gradually year by year. /79 108. It is doubtful whether such steady improvement s can be maintained and extended if energy prices a re held below the level needed to encourage the design and adoption of more energy-efficient homes, indus trial processes, and transportation vehicles. The level r equired will vary greatly within and between countr ies, depending on a wide range of factors. But whatever it is, it should be maintained. In volatile energy markets, the question is how. 109. Nations intervene in the 'market price' of ene rgy in a variety of ways. Domestic taxes (or subsid ies) on electrical power rates, oil, gas and other fuels ar e most common. They vary greatly between and even w ithin countries where different states, provinces, and so metimes even municipalities have the right to add t heir own tax. Although taxes on energy have seldom been levi ed to encourage the design and adoption of efficien cy measures, they can have that result if they cause e nergy prices to rise beyond a certain level - a lev el that varies greatly among jurisdictions. 110. Some nations also maintain higher than market prices on energy through duties on imported electri city, fuel, and fuel products. Others have negotiated bil ateral pricing arrangements with oil and gas produc ers in which they stabilize prices for a period of time. 111. In most countries, the price of oil eventually determines the price of alternative fuels. Extreme fluctuations in oil prices, such as the world has experienced re cently, endanger programmes to encourage conservati on. Many positive energy developments worldwide that ma de sense with oil above $25 per barrel, are harder to justify at lower prices. Investments in renewables, energy-efficient industrial processes, transport v ehicles, and energy-services may be reduced. Most are needed to ease the transition to a safer and more sustainable energy future beyond this century. This goal requir es a long, uninterrupted effort to succeed. 112. Given the importance of oil prices on internat ional energy policy, the Commission recommends that new mechanisms for encouraging dialogue between consume rs and producers be explored. 113. If the recent momentum behind annual gains in energy efficiency is to be maintained and extended, governments need to make it an explicit goal of the ir policies for energy pricing to consumers. Prices needed to encourage the adoption of energy-saving measures ma y be achieved by any of the above means or by other United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. means. Although the Commission expresses no prefere nce, conservation pricing requires that governments take a long-term view in weighing the costs and ben efits of the various measures. They need to operate over extended periods, dampening wild fluctuations in th e price of primary energy, which can impair progres s towards energy conservation. VIII. Conclusion 114. It is clear that a low energy path is the best way towards a sustainable future. But given effici ent and productive uses of primary energy, this need not me an a shortage of essential energy services. Within the next 50 years, nations have the opportunity to produce t he same levels of energy services with as little as half the primary supply currently consumed. This requires pr ofound structural changes in socio-economic and institutional arrangements and is an important chal lenge to global society. 115. More importantly, it will buy the time needed to mount major programmes on sustainable forms of renewable energy, and so begin the transition to a safer, more sustainable energy era. The development of renewable sources will depend in part on a rational approach to energy pricing to secure a stable matr ix for such progress. Both the routine practice of efficie nt energy use and the development of renewables wil l help take pressure off traditional fuels, which are most needed to enable developing countries to realize t heir growth potential worldwide. 116. Energy is not so much a single product as a mi x of products and services, a mix upon which the we lfare of individuals, the sustainable development of nations , and the life-supporting capabilities of the globa l ecosystem depend. In the past, this mix has been allowed to f low together haphazardly, the proportions dictated by short- term pressures on and short-term goals of governmen ts, institutions, and companies. Energy is too impo rtant for its development to continue in such a random ma nner. A safe, environmentally sound, and economical ly viable energy pathway that will sustain human progr ess into the distant future is clearly imperative. It is also possible. But it will require new dimensions of pol itical will and institutional cooperation to achiev e it.

Industry is central to the economies of modern s ocieties and an indispensable motor of growth. It i s essential to developing countries, to widen their development base and meet growing needs. And though industrial ized countries are said to be moving into a post industr ial, information-based era, this shift must be powe red by a continuing flow of wealth from industry. /1 2. Many essential human needs can be met only throu gh goods and services provided by industry. The production of food requires increasing amounts of a grochemicals and machinery. Beyond this, the produc ts of industry form the material basis of contemporary st andards of living. Thus all nations require and rig htly aspire to efficient industrial bases to meet changing need s. 3. Industry extracts materials from the natural res ource base and inserts both products and pollution into the human environment. It has the power to enhance or d egrade the environment; it invariably does both. (S ee Chapter 2 for a discussion of the concept of sustainable dev elopment within the context of industry and resource use.) I. Industrial Growth and its Impact 4. As recently as 1950, the world manufactured only one-seventh of the goods it does today, and produc ed only one-third of the minerals. Industrial production gr ew most rapidly between 1950 and 1973, with a 7 per cent annual growth in manufacturing and a 5 per cent gro wth in mining. Since then growth rates have slowed, to about 3 per cent yearly between 1973 and 1985 in ma nufacturing and virtually zero growth in mining. /2 5. That earlier, rapid growth in production was ref lected in the rising importance of manufacturing in the economies of virtually all countries. By 1982, the relative share of value added to gross domestic pro duct by manufacturing (the 'manufacturing value added', or MVA) ranged from 19 per cent in developing countrie s as a whole to 21 per cent in industrialized market econo mies and 51 per cent of net material product in cen trally planned economies. (See Table 8-1.) If the extracti ve industries are taken into account, the share is even higher.

In recent years, the trend of the 1950s and 1960 s has been reversed. Manufacturing has declined in importance relative to other sectors of the economy . In many countries, this decline has been in progr ess since 1973. It is most noticeable in the case of industri al market economies, but the share of MVA in GDP ha s also declined in nearly half the 95 developing countries surveyed by UNIDO. /3 This may reflect the growing United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. interaction between industry and all fields of scie nce and technology and the increasing integration o f industry and services, as well as industry's ability to prod uce more with less. 7. The relative importance of industry as an employ er has been declining for some time in developed co untries. But the shift in jobs towards the service sector ha s accelerated sharply over the past 15 years with t he increasing adoption of new processes and technologi es. Economists continue to argue over whether the a dvent of an information-based economy will further depres s employment in industry or will expand job opportu nities overall. /4 8. Most developing countries started at independenc e with virtually no modern industry. Then during th e 1960s and 1970s their industrial production, employment, and trade consistently grow faster than these secto rs in developed market economies. By 1984, developing cou ntries accounted for 11.6 per cent of world MVA (st ill well short of the 'Lima target' of 25 per cent adop ted by UNIDO in 1975). The centrally planned econom ies of Eastern Europe had raised their share of world MVA from 15.2 per cent in 1963 to 24.9 per cent in 1984 . /5 9. The international trade in manufactured goods, w hich has consistently grown fatter than has world manufacturing output, is one of the factors underly ing the changing geography of industrialization. Ma ny developing nations, particularly newly industrializ ed countries (NICs), have shared in this growth and made spectacular progress in industrialization. Taking t he Third World as a whole, exports of manufactured goods have grown steadily relative to primary exports, ri sing from 13.3 per cent of their total non-oil expo rts in 1960 to 54.7 per cent in 1982. (See Table 8-2.) 10. In general, developing-country industrial produ ction is diversifying and moving into more capital intensive areas such as metal products, chemicals, machinery, and equipment. And heavy industries, traditionally the most polluting, have been growing in relation to li ght industries. At the same time, the share of indu stries involved in food products, and to a lesser extent i n textiles and clothing, has fallen significantly. 2. Environmental Decline and Response 11. Industry and its products have an impact on the natural resource base of civilization through the entire cycle of raw materials exploration and extraction, transf ormation into products, energy consumption, waste generation, and the use and disposal of products by consumers. These impacts may be positive, enhancin g the quality of a resource or extending its uses. Or the y may be negative, as a result of process and produ ct pollution and of depletion or degradation of resour ces. 12. The negative environmental impacts of industria l activity were initially perceived as localized pr oblems of air, water, and land pollution. Industrial expansio n following the Second World War took place without much awareness of the environment and brought with it a rapid rise in pollution, symbolized by the Lob Ange les smog; the proclaimed 'death' of Lake Erie; the prog ressive pollution of major rivers like the Meuse, K ibe, and Rhine; and chemical poisoning by mercury in Minamat a. These problems have also been found in many part s of the Third World as industrial growth, urbanizati on, and the use of automobiles spread. /6 13. Public concern grew rapidly and forced a broad debate on environment conservation and economic gro wth. The possibility that the process of industrial grow th would run into material resource constraints bec ame an important theme in this debate. Although non-renewa ble resources are by definition exhaustible, recent assessments suggest that few minerals are likely to run out in the near future.

By the late 1960s, growing awareness and public concern led to action by governments and industry in both industrial and some developing countries. Environme ntal protection and resource conservation policies and programmes were established, along with agencies to administer them. Initially policies focused on reg ulatory measures aimed at reducing emissions. Later a range of economic instruments were considered - taxation , pollution charges, and subsidies for pollution cont rol equipment - but only a few countries introduced them. Expenditures rose, gradually at first, reaching 1.0 per cent and as high as 2.0 per cent of GNP in som e industrial countries by the late 1970s. 15. Industry also responded to these problems by de veloping new technologies and industrial processes designed to reduce pollution and other adverse envi ronmental impacts. Expenditures on pollution contro l measures rose rapidly in some highly polluting indu stries; and corporations began to set up their own environmental policy and control units. Guidelines and codes of conduct were published covering safety of products and plant operations, trade practices, tec hnology transfer, and international cooperation. /7 National and international industry associations have also d eveloped guidelines and voluntary codes of practice . /8 I am one of the patients of air pollution.

Yoshi Suzuki Association of Patients of Pollution and Their Fami lies WCED Public Hearing Tokyo, 27 Feb 1987 16. The results were mixed, but during the decade a number of industrial countries experienced a signi ficant improvement in environmental quality. There was a c onsiderable roll back in air pollution in many citi es and water pollution in many lakes and rivers. Certain c hemicals were controlled. 17. But these achievements were limited to some ind ustrial countries. Taking the world as a whole, fer tilizer run-off and sewage discharges into rivers, lakes, a nd coastal waters have increased, with resulting im pacts on fishing, drinking water supply, navigation, and sce nic beauty. The water quality of most major rivers has not markedly improved over the years. It is, in fact, w orsening in many of them, as it is in many smaller rivers. Industrialized countries still suffer from 'traditi onal' forms of air and land pollution. Levels of su lphur and nitrogen oxides (NOV), suspended particulates, and hydrocarbons remain high and in some cases have United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. increased. Air pollution in parts of many Third Wor ld cities has risen to levels worse than anything w itnessed in the industrial countries during the 1960s. /9 18. It is becoming increasingly clear that the sour ces and causes of pollution are far more diffuse, c omplex, and interrelated - and the effects of pollution more wi despread, cumulative, and chronic - than hitherto b elieved. Pollution problems that were once local are now reg ional or even global in scale. Contamination of soi ls, ground-water, and people by agrochemicals is wideni ng and chemical pollution has spread to every corne r of the planet. The incidence of major accidents involv ing toxic chemicals has grown. Discoveries of hazar dous waste disposal sites - at Love Canal in the United States, for example, and at Lekkerkek in the Nether lands, Vac in Hungary, and Georgswerder in the Federal Rep ublic of Germany - have drawn attention to another serious problem. It is absolutely clear now that the present scale a nd rate of development of the productive forces req uire a different approach to the questions connected with environmental protection and rational utilization o f natural resources. This is a task of immense economic and s ocial significance. For actually it is a question o f people's health and a caring approach to the national wealth of each country. Moreover, it is also a question o f the future. And on the solution depends the conditions in which the coming generations will live. A. P. Semyonov Central Council of Trade Unions WCED Public Hearing Moscow, 8 Dec 1986 19. In the light of this and the growth trends proj ected through the next century, it is evident that measures to reduce, control, and prevent industrial pollution w ill need to be greatly strengthened. If they are no t, pollution damage to human health could become intolerable in certain cities and threats to property and ecosyste ms will continue to grow. Fortunately, the past two decades of environmental action have provided governments and industry with the policy experience and the technol ogical means to achieve more sustainable patterns o f industrial development. 20. At the beginning of the 1970s, both governments and industry were deeply worried about the costs o f proposed environmental measures. Some felt that the y would depress investment, growth, jobs, competitiveness, and trade, while driving up inflat ion. Such fears proved misplaced. A 1984 survey by OECD of assessments undertaken in a number of industrial co untries concluded that expenditures on environmenta l measures over the past two decades had a positive s hort term effect on growth and employment as the increased demand they generated raised the output o f economies operating at less than full capacity. T he benefits, including health, property, and ecosystem damages avoided, have been significant. More impor tant, these benefits have generally exceeded costs. /10 21. Costs and benefits have naturally varied among industries.One method of estimating the cost of pol lution abatement in industry compares expenditures on new plants and equipment that have pollution control fa cilities to hypothetical expenditures on new plants without such features. Studies using this comparison in the United States found that pollution abatement expenditures foe new plant and equipment for all manufacturing industries in that country in 1984 amounted to $4.5 3 billion, or 3.3 per cent of total new expenditure s. The chemical industry spent $580 million (3.8 per cent) on such equipment. /11 Similar studies in the Japanese steel industry found that new investment in pollution con trol equipment reached as high as 21.3 per cent of total investment in 1976 and even today remains around 5 per cent. /12 22. Firms involved in food processing, iron and ste el, non-ferrous metals, automobiles, pulp and paper , chemicals, and electric power generation - all majo r polluters have borne a high proportion of the tot al pollution control investment by industry. Such costs provided a strong incentive for many of these industries to develop a broad range of new processes and cleaner and more e fficient products and technologies. In fact, some f irms that a decade ago established teams to research and develop innovative technologies to meet new environmental standards are today among the most co mpetitive in their fields, nationally and internati onally. 23. Waste recycling and reuse have become accepted practices in many industrial sectors.

Pollution control has become a thriving branch of industry in its own right in several industriali zed countries. High-pollution industries such as iron and steel, o ther metals, chemicals, and energy production have often led in expanding into the fields of pollution control e quipment, detoxification and waste disposal technol ogy, measurement instruments, and monitoring systems. No t only have these industries become more efficient and competitive, but many have also found new opportuni ties for investment, sales, and exports. Looking to the future, a growing market for pollution control syst ems, equipment, and services is expected in practic ally all industrialized countries, including NICs. II. Sustainable Industrial Development in a Global Context 25. If industrial development is to be sustainable over the long term, it will have to change radicall y in terms of the quality of that development, particularly in in dustrialized countries. But this is not to suggest that industrialization has reached a quantitative limit, particularly in developing countries. Even today, according to UNIDO, world industrial output would have to be inc reased by a factor of 2.6 if consumption of manufac tured goods in developing countries were to be raised to current industrial country levels. /14 Given expected population growth, a five- to tenfold increase in w orld industrial output can be anticipated by the ti me world population stabilizes sometime in the next century. Such growth has serious implications for the futur e of the world's ecosystems and its natural resource base. Our ecological movement is not against industry, bu t we must think of the social function of industrie s and that pollution and progress are not the same thing. Poll ution is not the synonym of progress and therefore time has come for new development concepts to come up. Pollu tion should not be a synonym of progress because we know that pollution is controlled and when you do n ot control pollution you are transferring this poll ution to the community of the whole. Fabio Feldman Lawyer for Victims of Cubatao WCED Public Hearing Sao Paulo, 28-29 Oct 1985 26. In general, industries and industrial operation s should be encouraged that are more efficient in t erms of resource use, that generate less pollution and wast e, that are based on the use of renewable rather th an non renewable resources, and that minimize irreversible adverse impacts on human health and the environmen t. 1. Industrialization in the Third World 27. Growing populations and high proportions of you ng people in the Third World are leading to large i ncreases in the labour force. Agriculture cannot absorb them . Industry must provide these expanding societies n ot only with employment but with products and services. The y will experience massive increases in the producti on of basic consumer goods and a concomitant build-up of industrial infrastructure - iron and steel, paper, chemicals, building materials, and transportation. All this im plies considerable increase in energy and raw mater ial use, industrial hazards and wastes, accidents, and resou rce depletion. 28. The problems and prospects for industrial devel opment vary among the countries of the Third World, which differ greatly in size and resources. There are som e large countries with abundant natural resources a nd a substantial domestic market that provide a base for wide-ranging industrial development. Smaller, reso urce-rich countries are trying to build up an export-oriented processing industry. Several developing countries have based much of their industrial development on expor t industries in garments, consumer electronics, and light engineering. In many countries, however, industrial development is restricted to a few consumer-goods industries that cater to relatively small domestic markets. 29. The developing countries' share in world produc tion of iron and steel rose from 3.6 per cent in 19 55 to 17.3 per cent in 1984, when four countries - Brazil, Chi na, India, and the Republic of Korea - produced mor e than 10 million tons of steel each, as much as in many medi um-sized industrialized countries. /15 At the same time that this industry is contracting in many developed coun tries, it is expected to expand by 38 million tons between United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 1982 and 1990 in the developing world. Latin Americ a is projected to account for 41 per cent of this r ise, Southeast Asia for 36 per cent, the Middle East for 20 per cent, and Africa for 1.3 per cent. /16 30. Many developing countries still depend heavily on their exports of minerals and other commodities, mostly in unprocessed or only intermediately processed for ms. In the case of several major minerals such as aluminium and nickel, a few transnational corporati ons control the whole industry, from mining through final processing. /17 Some countries have been moderately successful in increasing the share of refined products in their exports. Yet most of these 'manufactured' goo ds are processed further in the industrial country that imports them. Thus in 1980, only 39 per cent of all Third World exports of manufactured goods were rea dy for final use, while 43 per cent of its total exports w ere unprocessed. /18 This ratio should improve as developing nations move into the further stages of processing. These improvements should be speeded up. 31. The expected growth in basic industries foresha dows rapid increases in pollution and resource degr adation unless developing countries take great care to cont rol pollution and waste, to increase recycling and reuse, and to minimize hazardous wastes. These countries do no t have the resources to industrialize now and repai r the damage later; nor will they have the time, given th e rapid pace of technological progress. They can pr ofit from the improvements in resource and environmental mana gement being achieved in industrialized countries, and so avoid the need for expensive clean-ups. Such tec hnologies can also help them reduce ultimate costs and stretch scarce resources. And they can learn from t he mistakes of developed countries, 32. Economies of scale are no longer always the pri mary consideration. New technologies in communicati ons, information, and process control allow the establis hment of small-scale, decentralized, widely dispers ed industries, thus reducing levels of pollution and o ther impacts on the local environment. There may, h owever, be trade-offs to be made: small-scale raw material processing, for example, is often labour-intensive and widely dispersed but intensive in the use of energy. Such dispersed industries could relieve big cities of so me of their population and pollution pressures. They could prov ide non-farming jobs in the countryside, produce co nsumer goods that cater to local markets, and help spread environmentally sound technologies. 2. Use of Energy and Raw Materials 33. Industrial growth is widely seen as inevitably accompanied by corresponding increases in energy an d raw material consumption. In the past two decades, howe ver, this pattern appears to have fundamentally cha nged. As growth has continued in the developed market eco nomies, the demand for many basic materials, includ ing energy and water, has levelled off; in some cases, it has actually declined in absolute terms. 34. Energy consumption per unit of GDP in OECD coun tries has been dropping at a rate of 1-3 per cent e very year since the late 1960s. Between 1973 and 1983, t hese nations improved energy efficiency by 1.7 per cent annually. /19 Industrial water consumption per unit of productio n has also declined. Older pulp and paper mills typically used about 160 cubic metres of water per ton of pulp; those built during the 1970s, however, used only 70. With advanced techniques that keep water circul ating within a closed system, and with proper staff training, use rates could be lowered to 20-30 cubic metres pe r ton of pulp. /20 35. An integrated steel mill uses about 80-200 tons of water for every ton of crude steel. However, si nce only about 3 tons of water per ton of crude steel are lo st, mostly by evaporation, recycling can greatly re duce consumption. /21 Closed water circulation systems are not unique to the steel industry or to developed market economies. Between 1975 and 1980, the chemical indu stry's output in the USSR increased by 76 per cent, but the total consumption of fresh water remained at th e 1975 level. /22 And between 1981 and 1986, Soviet industrial output increased by 25 per cent but indu strial water consumption remained constant. /23 36. Declines in consumption of other raw materials began much earlier. In fact, the amount of raw mate rials needed for a given unit of economic output has been dropping over this entire century, except in warti me, for practically all non-agricultural commodities. /24 A recent study of consumption trends of seven basi c materials in the United States bears this out, /25 as do studies in Japan. Japan used only 60 per cen t as much raw materials for every unit of industrial production in 1984 as it used in 1973. /26 These efficiency trends do not result from a decline in manufacturing in favour of service indus tries, for over these periods the output of the man ufacturing sector continued to grow The productivity and effic iency of resource use are constantly improving, and industrial production is steadily switching away fr om heavily material intensive products and processe s. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 37. The two oil price hikes of the 1970s shocked ma ny countries into saving money by promoting conserv ation measures, switching to other fuels, and raising ove rall energy efficiency. These events demonstrated t he importance of energy pricing policies that take int o account their current stock, depletion rates, ava ilability of substitutes, and any unavoidable environmental dama ge associated with their extraction or processing. (See Chapter 7 .) They also indicated the potential of similar pri cing policies for other raw materials. I think there must be a persistent push, a persiste nt effort towards establishing some kind of interna tional code for areas of technologies having high environmental risks. At the moment not many in Indonesia would b e considered as very knowledgeable industries. We nee d also this kind of thing in order to guarantee som e kind of minimum safety for countries like ours to develo p within the context of international economic rela tions. Speaker from the floor WCED Public Hearing Jakarta, 26 March 1985 38. Some have referred to these processes as the in creasing 'de-materialization' of society and the wo rld economy. Yet even the most industrially advanced ec onomies still depend on a continued supply of basic manufactured goods. Whether made domestically or im ported, their production will continue to require l arge amounts of raw materials and energy, even if develo ping countries progress rapidly in the adoption of resource- efficient technologies. To sustain production momen tum on a global level, therefore, policies that inj ect resource efficiency considerations into economic, t rade, and other related policy domains are urgently needed, particularly in industrial countries, along with st rict observance of environmental norms, regulations , and standards. 3. Promises and Risks of New Technologies 39. Technology will continue to change the social, cultural, and economic fabric of nations and the wo rld community. With careful management, new and emergin g technologies offer enormous opportunities for rai sing productivity and living standards, for improving he alth, and for conserving the natural resource base. Many will also bring new hazards, requiring an improved capac ity for risk assessment and risk management. (See Chapter 12 .) 40. Information technology based chiefly on advance s in micro-electronics and computer science is of p articular importance. Coupled with rapidly advancing means of communication, it can help improve the productivit y, energy and resource efficiency, and organizational structure of industry. 41. New materials such it fine ceramics, rare metal s and metal alloys, high-performance plastics, and now composites allow more flexible approaches to produc tion. They also contribute to energy and resource conservation, as in general they require less energ y to manufacture and, being lighter, contain less m atter than conventional materials. 42. Biotechnology will have major implications for the environment. The products of genetic engineerin g could dramatically improve human and animal health. Resea rchers are finding new drugs, new therapies, and ne w ways of controlling disease vectors. Energy derived from plants could increasingly substitute for non- renewable fossil fuels. New high-yield crop varieties and tho se resistant to unfavourable weather conditions and pests could revolutionize agriculture. Integrated pest ma nagement will become more common. Biotechnology cou ld also yield cleaner and more efficient alternatives to many wasteful processes and polluting products. New techniques to treat solid and liquid wastes could h elp solve the pressing problem of hazardous waste disposal. /27 43. Advances in space technology, now the almost ex clusive domain of industrial countries, also hold p romise for the Third World, even for agriculture-based eco nomies. Weather forecasting services provided throu gh a satellite and communications network can help farme rs in deciding when to plant, water, fertilize, and harvest crops. Remote sensing and satellite imagery could f acilitate optimal use of the Earth's resources, per mitting the monitoring and assessment of long-term trends in cl imatic change, marine pollution, soil erosion rates , and plant cover. (See Chapter 10 .) 44. These new technologies and the Green Revolution blur the traditional distinctions between agricult ure, industry, and services. And they make it possible f or developments in one sector to more radically aff ect those United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. in another. Agriculture has become virtually an 'in dustry' in developed countries. Agriculture-related services - especially for regional weather forecasting, storag e, and transport - are becoming ever more important . New techniques of tissue culture and genetic engineerin g could soon generate plant strains able to fix nit rogen from the air, a development that would drastically affec t the fertilizer industry, but that would also redu ce the threat of pollution by agrochemicals. 45. The chemical and energy industries are moving i ncreasingly into the seeds business, providing new seeds that meet specific local conditions and requirement s - but that may also need specific fertilizers and pesticides. Here research and development, production, and mark eting need to be carefully guided so as not to make the world even more dependent on a few crop varieties - or on the products of a few large transnational 46. Yet new technologies are not all intrinsically benign, nor will they have only positive impacts on the environment. The large-scale production and widespr ead use of new materials, for example, may create hitherto unknown health hazards (such as the use of gallium arsenate in the microchip industry.) /28 Risk research might be carried out and products manufact ured where safeguards are weak or where people are unaware of the dangers. The need for caution in int roducing a new technology is reinforced by the expe rience of the Green Revolution, which, despite formidable achievements, raises concerns over dependence on relatively few crop strains and large doses of agro chemicals. New life forms produced by genetic engin eering should be carefully tested and assessed for their p otential impact on health and on the maintenance of genetic diversity and ecological balance before they are in troduced to the market, and thus to the environment . /29 III. Strategies for Sustainable Industrial Developm ent 47. Resource and environmental considerations must be integrated into the industrial planning and deci sion- making processes of government and industry. This w ill allow a steady reduction in the energy and reso urce content of future growth by increasing the efficien cy of resource use, reducing waste, and encouraging resource recovery and recycling. 1. Establish Environmental Goals, Regulations, Ince ntives, and Standards 48. In dealing with industrial pollution and resour ce degradation, it is essential that industry, gove rnment, and the public have clear benchmarks. Where the workfor ce and financial resources permit, national governm ents should establish clear environmental goals and enfo rce environmental laws, regulations, incentives, an d standards on industrial enterprises. In formulating such policies, they should give priority to public health problems associated with industrial pollution and h azardous wastes. And they must improve their environmental statistics and data base relating to industrial activities. 49. The regulations and standards should govern suc h matters as air and water pollution, waste managem ent, occupational health and safety of workers, energy a nd resource efficiency of products or processes, an d the manufacture, marketing, use, transport, and disposa l of toxic substances. This should normally be done at the national level, with local governments being empowe red to exceed, but not to lower, national norms. In preparing environmental regulations, it is importan t that flexible systems are adopted without specify ing a particular process or technology and recognizing th at governments differ greatly in their capacity to formulate legal standards and enforce them. 50. Regulations to control the impacts of industria l activity across national boundaries and on the in ternational commons are also needed. Existing or future interna tional conventions dealing with transfrontier pollu tion or management of shared natural resources should enshr ine certain key principles: the responsibility of every state not to harm the health and environment of other nations, liability and compensation for any damage caused b y transfrontier pollution, and equal right of access to remedial measures by all parties concerned.

Make More Effective Use of Economic Instruments 51. Pollution is a form of waste, and a symptom of inefficiency in industrial production. When industr ies recognize pollution as a cost, they are sometimes m otivated to make investments in improved products a nd processes to increase efficiency and hence to reduc e the pollution and waste they generate, particular ly when there are economic incentives to do so, it largely depends on whether such investments will increase t heir economic performance. 52. But there are limits to what society can expert industry operating in competition with other indus tries to do voluntarily. Regulations imposing uniform performan ce standards are essential to ensure that industry makes the investments necessary to reduce pollution and w aste and to enable them to compete on an equal foot ing. 53. Air and water have traditionally been regarded as 'free' goods, but the enormous costs to society of past and present pollution show that they are not free. The environmental costs of economic activity are no t encountered until the assimilative capacity of the environment has been exceeded. Beyond that point, t hey cannot be avoided. They will be paid. The policy qu estion is how and by whom they will be paid, not wh ether. Basically, there are only two ways. The costs can b e 'externalized' - that is, transferred to various segments of the community in the form of damage costs to human health, property, and ecosystems. Or they can 'internalized' - paid by the enterprise. The enterp rise may invest in measures to prevent the damages and, if the market for its product allows, pass the costs along to the consumer. Or it may invest in measures to r estore unavoidable damage replanting forests, restocking f ish, rehabilitating land after mining. Or it may co mpensate victims of health and property damage. In these cas es, too, the costs may be passed on to the consumer . 54. Enterprises may be encouraged to invest in prev entive, restorative, or compensatory measures with subsidies of various kinds. Indeed, in most industr ialized and many developing countries, subsidies ar e a common way of encouraging companies to invest in me asures needed to prevent external damage. But in th is case, of course, it is the taxpayer who pays, rathe r than the consumer of the product. Moreover, if th e subsidies are large and paid to industries operating in an in ternational market, they can lead to trade distorti ons and should be avoided. 55. In 1972, the member countries of OECD agreed to base their environmental policies on a Polluter Pa ys Principle (PPP). /30 Essentially an economic efficiency measure, PPP is intended to encourage industries to internalize environmental costs and reflect them in the prices of products. At the same time, state re gulations in CMEA countries are carried out through government b odies that allow environmental concerns to be taken into account. We move towards attacking the sources and not the e ffects. But we also meet environmental questions in our markets, among our own employees and in our local e nvironment. This definitely provides experiences th at underline the need for a more complete and comprehe nsive thinking about the systems of which environme nt becomes an integral part. We also, as industry, mee t the problems of international relations and envir onment, unfortunately very often in the way of hidden trade barriers or difficulties in cooperation between au thorities. Rolf Marstrander Director, Environment Affairs, Norsk Hydro WCED Public Hearing Oslo, 24-25 June 1985 56. In the case of OECD, the guidelines on PPP were intended to discourage subsidies that could lead t o distortions in trade. Countries agreed to phase out the use of subsidies over varying periods of time. (See Chapter 3 for the application of PPP to international trade and investment.) 57. Incentives to reduce pollution can be enhanced by other measures. Energy and water pricing policie s, for example, can push industries to consume less. Produ ct redesign and technological innovations leading t o safer products, more efficient processes, and recycling o f raw materials can also be promoted by a more effe ctive, integrated use of economic incentives and disincent ives, such as investment tax breaks, low-interest l oans, depreciation allowances, pollution or waste charges , and non-compliance fees. 58. Sometimes the way in which other policy objecti ves are promoted unintentionally reduces the effect iveness of environmental programmers. For example, subsidie s on raw materials or water supply or energy to pro mote United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. the development of industry in remote areas may wel l dilute the pressure to conserve resources. Govern ments should examine whether existing economic policies, instruments, or subsidies provided to various indus try- based programmes and projects contribute effectivel y to the promotion of environmentally sound and res ource efficient practices. 3. Broaden Environmental Assessments 59. An increasing number of countries require that certain major investments be subject to an environm ental impact assessment. This broader environmental asses sment should he applied not only to products and projects, but also to policies and programmed, espe cially major macroeconomic, finance, and sectoral p olicies that induce significant impacts on the environment. 60. Many developing countries, particularly in Asia and Latin America, have adopted systems for enviro nmental impact assessment. But the lack of institutional ca pacity and skilled personnel mean that these are of ten conducted by outside consultants, without quality c hecks. In some cases, government authorities would benefit from a second opinion on the environmental document ation they receive. Interested governments should c reate an independent international assessment body to hel p developing countries, upon request, evaluate the environmental impact and sustainability of planned development projects. 4. Encourage Action by Industry 61. Industry's response to pollution and resource d egradation has not been and should not be limited t o compliance with regulations. It should accept a bro ad sense of social responsibility and ensure an awa reness of environmental considerations at a levels. Toward s this end, all industrial enterprises, trade assoc iations, and labour unions should establish company wide or indu stry-wide policies concerning resource and environm ental management, including compliance with the laws and requirements of the country in which they operate. 62. International trade associations play a major r ole in Betting standards and disseminating informat ion, which must be significantly expanded. They should establi sh and make widely available sectoral guidelines fo r assessing the sustainability and potential hazards of new facilities, for developing accident continge ncy plans, and for selecting pollution control or waste treatm ent technologies. Such key industry associations as the International Chamber of Commerce and the European Council of Chemical Manufacturers' Federation that have taken important and encouraging leadership rol es in dealing with environmental issues should now take a lead in addressing the broader concerns inherent in sustainable development. 63. With limited resources at their disposal, small and medium- sized industries often find themselves unable to afford the changes necessary to meet environmental regulations and product controls. Small scale busin esses such as metal working, machine tools, printing, and tanning and dying are frequently among the worst offenders of environmental regulations in any count ry. New technologies, especially micro-electronics, already allow small industries inexpensive means to control an entire production process. Energy-saving biolog ical systems may be well suited to the needs of small an d medium sized industries for pollution control or waste disposal. 64. Small and medium scale enterprises, constitutin g the largest segment of industry in most nations, need information and may in some cases require financial and technical assistance from the public sector. Management and worker training can help them incorp orate cleaner technologies and environmental planni ng into work patterns. Governments should encourage co operative efforts smaller firms in joint research a nd development on environmental issues, for example, o r joint use of pollution control or waste treatment facilities. 5. Increase Capacity to Deal with Industrial Hazard s 65. Chemical products have greatly improved health and life expectancies; increased agricultural produ ction; raised comfort, convenience, and the general qualit y of life; and expanded economic opportunities. The chemical industry is also one of the most dynamic s ectors in most countries, including many developing ones. Yet this industry, together with its products, can have a particularly severe impact on the environmen t. It has given rise to a host of new problems both of produc t and process pollution. It continues to generate a n increasingly wider range of products and wastes who se effects, especially long-term ones, on human hea lth United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. and the environment are not precisely known. Major accidents have taken place, and the safety record o f the industry has been challenged in recent years. 66. In a world more and more dependent on chemical products and highly complex large-scale technologie s, accidents with catastrophic consequences are likely to increase. Some of the heavy metals and non-meta llic minerals, such as asbestos, also pose serious hazar ds to health and the environment. Various hazardous products and processes are already built into curre nt systems of production and the technological stru cture of contemporary society, and it will be a long time be fore these can be replaced with less dangerous, inh erently safer technologies and systems. Some highly toxic c hemicals that are known to cause cancer and birth d efects and have long-term genetic effects are already in t he environment in significant concentrations, and m ay take decades to be diffused. 5.1 Chemicals 67. Chemicals represent about 10 per cent of total world trade in terms of value, /31 some 70,000-80,000 chemicals are now on the market - and hence in the environment. /32 The figure is only an informed estimate because no complete inventory has been done. Some 1 ,000-2,000 new chemicals enter the commercial marke t each year, many without adequate prior testing or e valuation of effects. 68. According to a U.S. National Research Council s ample of 65,725 chemicals in common use, data requi red for complete health hazard evaluations were availab le for only 10 per cent of pesticides and 18 per ce nt of drugs. No toxicity data existed for nearly 80 per c ent of the chemicals used in commercial products an d processes inventoried under the Toxic Substances Co ntrol Act. /33 This situation is now beginning to change as governments move gradually from a system of post-ma rket testing to one of pre-market testing of all ne w chemicals. 69. By 1986, more than 500 chemicals and chemical p roducts had been banned altogether or had their use s severely restricted in the country of origin. /34 In addition, an unknown number of chemicals are wi thdrawn from clearance processes every year in the light of cont rol agency concerns, or are never submitted to nati onal control agencies for clearance. Some of these end u p on the export market. 70. In industrial countries, in an increasingly int erdependent and effective system, chemical control agencies share test results and notify each other of new res trictions on chemicals. A ban or restriction in one country is thus often quickly followed by a review and appropr iate action in the others. 71. Importing developing countries do not, as a rul e, share in this system. Recently, some industrial countries undertook to require their industry to provide a on e-time notification to importing countries of chemi cals that they have formally banned or severely restricted. T hey agreed to provide prior notification of the pro posed export/import of such chemicals and they also agree d to provide the importing country with the informa tion that led them to ban or restrict the chemical, if it is requested. While the intent behind this system is l audable, it is difficult to see how it can work for importing coun tries that have no control institutions to receive the notification or professional capacity to assess the information. 72. Third World importers have no way to effectivel y control trade in chemicals that have been banned or severely restricted in exporting countries. Thus th ese countries badly need the infrastructure to asse ss the risks associated with chemical use. In view of the seriou sness of this situation, the Commission recommends that all governments, particularly those of the major chemic al-producing countries, should: undertake that no new chemicals be placed on inter national markets until the health and environmental impacts have been tested and assessed; reinforce on-going efforts to obtain international agreement on the selection of existing chemicals f or priority testing, on criteria and procedures for th eir assessment, and on a system for international s haring of the tasks and the resources required; strictly regulate the export to developing countri es of those chemicals for which authorization for d omestic sale has not been sought or given, by extending req uirements for prior notification and information exchange to them; and United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. support the establishment in existing regional org anizations of units qualified to receive such prior notification and information, to assess it and to a dvise governments in the region on the risks associ ated with the use of these chemicals, in order to permit individual governments to weigh these risks agains t benefits they may perceive from importation of the chemicals. 73. Consumer awareness should be increased. Governm ents should encourage the establishment of information centres on chemical products used by co nsumers and strengthen the international networks o f information exchange, assessment, and data banks no w evolving in the UN and elsewhere. /35 Another essential step is the adoption and enforcement of r egulations on the packaging and labelling of chemic als whose use may be potentially harmful, to ensure tha t clear directions are provided in common local lan guages. Consumer unions and other non-governmental organiza tions should take the lead in collecting and distri buting comparative risk information on ingredients in cons umer products such as cleaning agents and pesticide s. The most explosive development in the establishment of chemical and pollutive industry has come in developing countries. This is an outright danger. T he last accidents are but a few of those that may c ome. However, we recognize that considerable responsibil ity tests on the trade union movement in the indivi dual countries in pressing for influence on authorities and managements to avoid both such accidents and investments from companies that do net follow accep table standards. Technology development has improved environment in the industrial parts of the world. The new producti on and information systems make it more difficult, the n, for the developing countries to use cheap labour as a means to attract industry to their countries. The f uture for these countries does not look very bright , unless the international society takes it upon itself to affec t a sharing of production technology and resources. This is politically difficult indeed. Juul Bjerke International Confederation of Free Trade Unions WCED Public Hearing Oslo, 24-25 June 1985 74. The chemical producer and user industries, as t he source of the risks associated with chemicals an d as the greatest beneficiary of their use should bear the r esponsibility for ensuring (and the liability for n ot ensuring) that their products meet the highest standards of s afety, have the fewest adverse side effects on heal th and the environment, and are handled with appropriate care by workers and users. This will require the fullest possible disclosure of information about the properties and production processes of chemical substances and on comparative risks, not only to the regulatory autho rities but also to the workers, consumers, and resi dents of the community in which a chemical industry operates . 5.2 Hazardous Wastes 75. Industrialized countries generate about 90 per cent of the world's hazardous wastes. Although all estimates have a wide margin of error, given considerable dif ferences in definition of 'hazardous waste', in 198 4 some 325 million to 375 million tons were generated worl dwide, /36 around 5 million tons of which were in the newly industrialized and developing areas of the world. /37 76. In OECD member countries alone, thousands of wa ste disposal sites exist, many of which are likely to require some form of remedial action. Clean-up is e xpensive: Estimates include $10 billion for the Fed eral Republic of Germany, more than $1.5 billion for the Netherlands, $20-100 billion for the United States , and at least $60 million for Denmark (in 1966 dollars). /38 A large number of potentially hazardous sites may also exist in concentrated industrial-urban areas in centrally planned economies as well as in developing countri es. Some form of government intervention is required through regulatory action or financial support. 77. Waste management in developing countries suffer s from a variety of problems. Frequent and heavy ra ins in the tropics, for instance, leach wastes into the so ils under landfills or even cause them to overflow. With little or no pretreatment of wastes, this could contaminate w ater supplies or cause local people to be directly exposed to the wastes. Land-filling generally occurs close to industrial states that are surrounded by poor neighbourhoods or shanty towns. /39 These dangers point up the need for land use plann ing in developing countries, and the mote urgent need to actually imp lement and enforce such plans. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 78. The overriding policy objective must be to redu ce the amount of waste generated and to transform a n increasing amount into resources for use and reuse. This will reduce the volume that otherwise must be treated or disposed of through incineration, land disposal, or dumping at sea. This is first and foremost a pr oblem of industrialized countries. But it is also a problem in NICs and developing countries, where rapid indus trialization is bringing the same severe problems of hazardous w aste management. 78. The amount of wastes crossing national frontier s is increasing and is likely to continue to do so. Between 1962 and 1983, wastes transported in Western Europe for disposal in another country virtually doubled, reaching some 250,000- 425,000 tons (1-2 per cent o f the total hazardous wastes generated). /40 This increase may be attributed partly to the availability of rel atively low-cost, legal, land-based disposal facili ties in some countries. For example, about 4,000 shipments of ha zardous wastes went from the Netherlands to the Ger man Democratic Republic in 1984. And the Federal Republ ic of Germany sent about 20,000 shipments to the German Democratic Republic the preceding year. Inte rnational transport of wastes meant for disposal at sea, either by incineration or dumping, amounted to abou t 1.8 million tons in 1983. /41 Small and poor countries are especially vulnerable to offshore dumping, as has o ccurred in the waters of the Pacific and the Caribb ean. 80. Some countries have recently proposed what amou nts to a commodity trade in hazardous (including radioactive) wastes. Strengthened international coo peration in this area is vitally important, and sev eral international bodies have taken up the matter. /42 An international agreement currently being develop ed by OECD is to be based on three important principles: equally strict controls on shipments to non member countries; prior notification to and consent from t he country of final destination, whether member or non- member country; and a guarantee of existence of ade quate disposal facilities in the recipient country. UNEP has drawn up extensive draft guidelines, but as of now there is no effective mechanism either to monit or or to control hazardous waste trade and dumping. /43 Governments and international organizations must m ore actively support efforts to achieve an effective in ternational regime to control the transfrontier mov ement of hazardous wastes. 5.3 Industrial Accidents 81. Accidents involving toxic chemicals and radioac tive materials can occur in plants in any region. A ccording to a survey carried out by the U.S. Environmental P rotection Agency, 6,928 accidents of varying severi ty occurred at U.S. plants between 1980 and 1965 - an average of five a day. /44 82. In 1984, liquid gas storage tanks exploded in M exico City, killing 1,000 people and leaving thousa nds more homeless. Only months after the Bhopal tragedy in I ndia, which killed over 2,000 people and injured 20 0,000 more, an accident at a plant in West Virginia in th e United States operated by the parent company of t he Bhopal facility resulted in emergency evacuation of residents and some health problems. The accidental release in 1976 of the highly toxic and mutagenic c hemical dioxin at Seveso, Italy, and the ensuing sa ga of drums of contaminated soil being passed around Euro pe, also showed that in industrial countries regula tions can be evaded and minimum safety standards breached . 83. In early November 1986, a fire at a warehouse o f a chemicals manufacturer in Basel, Switzerland, s ent toxic fumes into France and the Federal Republic of Germany and released toxic chemicals into the Rhin e, causing massive fish kills and affecting the vital water supply in countries downstream, all the way t o the Netherlands. Scientists investigating the Rhine agr eed that it could be years before the damaged river ine ecosystems would return to their former statue. /45 84. Thus incidents at Mexico City, Bhopal, Chernoby l, and Basel - all occurring within the short lifet ime of this Commission raised public concern about industrial d isasters. They also demonstrated the likelihood of significant increases in the frequency and magnitud e of industrial accidents with catastrophic consequ ences. 85. These events point to the need to strengthen na tional capabilities and the framework for bilateral and regional cooperation. National and local government s should: survey hazardous industrial operations and adopt, and enforce regulations or guidelines on the safe operation of industrial plants and on the transport , handling, and disposal of hazardous materials; United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. adopt land use policies or regional development pl ans that would require or provide incentives to industries that have a high pollution or accident p otential to locate away from population centres, an d that would discourage people from moving close to plants and waste disposal sites; ensure that plant workers are provided with full i nformation about the products and technologies they handle, and are given adequate training in safe ope rational procedures and emergency preparedness; and involve local governments and community residents in major siting decisions and emergency preparedness planning. In industry, we feel it must now be made mandatory for any firm that is potentially polluting nature t hrough liquid gas or particle emissions to enrol their staff in s hort but instructive courses of environmental educa tion. Too often firms pollute not just through accident or de sign but through gross ignorance by the labour invo lved of the destructive effect on the environment. Donald Aubrey Society to Overcome Pollution WCED Public Hearing Ottawa, 26-27 May 1986 86. Increasingly, the consequences of accidents may seriously affect neighbouring countries. Nations s hould enter into arrangements with other nations that cou ld be seriously affected by an accident in hazardou s facilities located on its territory, under which th ey would agree to: notify each other of the location and essential ch aracteristics of existing hazardous installations, an accident in which could spill over and affect lives , property, and ecosystems in the other; prepare contingency plans covering potential accid ents in these installations; provide prompt alert, full information, and mutual assistance in case of accidents; establish criteria for selection of sites for new hazardous facilities, which would then be subject t o the above; and establish standards for the liability and compensa tion for any damage caused by transfrontier polluti on. 87. Industrial accidents and their consequences are to a large extent unpredictable. In order to bette r identify risks, governments, international organizations, an d industry itself should promote further developmen t of technology/risk assessment methodologies, establish data banks on such assessments conducted, and make them easily available to all countries. 6. Strengthen International Efforts to Help Develop ing Countries 88. Pollution-intensive, resource-based industries are growing fastest in developing countries. These governments will thus have to substantially strengt hen their environmental and resource management capabilities. Even where policies, laws, and regula tions on the environment exist, they may not be con sistently enforced. Many developing nations have begun to bui ld up their educational and scientific infrastructu re, but their technical and institutional capacity for maki ng the most of imported or new technologies remains small. Some countries thus continue to depend on outside t echnical and managerial skills for the maintenance of industrial operations. For lack of capital, they of ten find that a new industry can only be started wi th the support of foreign aid, commercial loans, a direct investme nt, or a joint venture with a transnational corpora tion. 89. The importance of private investment and the ke y role of transnational corporations have already b een highlighted. (See Chapter 3 .) It is inconceivable that a successful transition to sustainable development can be achieved unless the policies and practices are reor iented around sustainable development objectives. T hose external agencies that support and facilitate priva te investment, particularly export credit and inves tment insurance organizations, should also incorporate su stainable development criteria into their policies and practices. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 90. The problems of developing-country governments are compounded by the vagaries of the international economic system, such as high debts, high interest rates, and declining terms nf trade for commodities . These do not encourage hard-pressed governments to spend high proportions of their meagre resources on environmental protection and resource management. ( See Chapter 3 .) 91. The developing countries themselves will eventu ally have to bear the consequences of inappropriate industrialization, and the ultimate responsibility for ensuring the sustainability of their developmen t rests with each government. They must define their own environ mental goals and development objectives, and establ ish clear priorities among competing demands on their s carce resources. They will also need to search for more self-reliant means of industrial and technological development. The choices are theirs, but they will need all the assistance - technical, financial, and institutiona l - that the international community can muster to help them set an environmentally sound and sustainable course of development. 92. Large industrial enterprises, and transnational corporations in particular, have a special respons ibility. They are repositories of scarce technical skills, and th ey should adopt the highest safety and health prote ction standards practicable and assume responsibility for safe plant and process design and for staff traini ng. The transnational should also institute environmental a nd safety audits of their plants measured against s tandards at other subsidiaries, not just against those of ot her local companies, which may have less stringent requirements These audits and their follow-up shoul d be made available to governments and other intere sted parties. 93. Particular care is required in dealing with tox ic chemicals and hazardous wastes, and in contingen cy planning for accidents. The views of non-government al organizations and the local community should be sought in planning new industrial facilities. The r elevant national and local authorities must be full y informed about the properties, potentially harmful effects, and any potential risks to the community of the tec hnology, process, or product being introduced. The necessary information should be disclosed to nearby resident s in an easily understandable manner. The enterprises must cooperate with the local government, and community in contingency planning and in devising clearly define d mechanisms for relief and compensation to polluti on or accident victims. 94. Many developing countries need information on t he nature of industry-based resource and environmen tal problems, on risks associated with certain processe s and products, and on standards and other measures to protect health and ensure environmental sustainabil ity. They also need trained people to apply such in formation to local circumstances. International trade associa tions and labour unions should develop special environmental training programmes for developing co untries and disseminate information on pollution co ntrol, waste minimization, and emergency preparedness plan s through local chapters. Footnotes 1/ As will be noted later in this chapter, the conv entional classification of economic activities into three sectors - primary (agriculture and mining), secondary (manufa cturing), and tertiary (commerce and other services ) - has become increasingly ambiguous. Some economic activi ties cut across all three. Furthermore, the service s sector has begun to occupy an important place of it s own in industrialized economies. In this chapter, however, the term 'industry' will be used in the traditional sense to include mining and quarrying, manufacturi ng, construction, electricity, water, and gas.

By the turn of the century, almost half the worl d will live in urban areas - from small towns to hu ge megacities. /1 The world's economic system is increasingly an urb an one, with overlapping networks of communications, production, and trade. /2 This system, with its flows of information, energy , capital, commerce, and people, provides the backbone for national deve lopment. A city's prospects - or a town's - depend critically on its place within the urban system, national and international. So does the fate of the hinterland, with its agriculture, forestry, and mining, on which the urb an system depends. 2. In many nations, certain kinds of industries and service enterprises are now being developed in rur al areas. But they receive high-quality infrastructure and se rvices, with advanced telecommunications systems en suring that their activities are part of the national (and global) urban-industrial system. In effect, the co untryside is being 'urbanized'.

Uni ted Nations, New York. I. The Growth of Cities 3. This is the century of the 'urban revolution'. I n the 35 years since 1950, the number of people liv ing in cities almost tripled, increasing by 1.25 billion. In the more developed regions, the urban population nearly doubled, from 447 million to 838 million. In the less develo ped world, it quadrupled, growing from 286 million to 1.14 billion. (See Table 9-1.) 4. Over only 60 years, the developing world's urban population increased tenfold, from around 100 mill ion in 1920 to close to 1 billion in 1980. At the same tim e, its rural population more than doubled. In 1940, only one person in eight lived in an urba n centre, while about one in 100 lived in a city wi th a million or more inhabitants (a 'million city'). By 1960, more than one in five persons lived in an urban centre, and one in 16 in a 'million city'. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. By 1980, nearly one in three persons was an urban dweller and one in 10 a 'million city' resident. /3 5. The population of many of sub-Saharan Africa's l arger cities increased more than sevenfold between 1950 and 1980 Nairobi, Dar es Salaam, Nouakchott, Lusaka , Lagos, and Kinshasa among them. /4 (See Table 9-2.) During these same 30 years, populations in many Asi an and Latin American cities (such as Seoul, Baghda d, Dhaka, Amman, Bombay, Jakarta, Mexico City, Manila, Sao Paulo, Bogota, and Managua) tripled or quadrupled. In such cities, net immigration has usu ally been a greater contributor than natural increa se to the population growth of recent decades. 6. In many developing countries, cities have thus g rown far beyond anything imagined only a few decade s ago and at speeds without historic precedent. (See Box 9-1.) But some experts doubt that developing nation s will urbanize as rapidly in the future as in the last 10 -40 years, or that megacities will grow as large as UN projections suggest. Their argument is that many of the most powerful stimuli to rapid urbanization in the past have less influence today, and that changing govern ment policies could reduce the comparative attracti veness of cities, especially the largest cities, and slow rates or urbanization. 7. The urban population growth rate in developing c ountries as a whole has been slowing down from 5.2 per cent per annum in the late 1950s to 3.4 per cent in the 1950s. /5 It is expected to decline even further in the coming decades. Nevertheless, if current trends hol d. Third World cities could add a further three-qua rters of a billion people by the year 2000. Over the same time , the cities of the industrial world would grow by a further 111 million. /6 8. These projections put the urban challenge firmly in the developing countries, in the space of just 15 years (or about 5,500 days), the developing world will have t o increase by 65 per cent its capacity to produce a nd manage its urban infrastructure, services, and shel ter - merely to maintain present conditions. And in many countries, this must be accomplished under conditio ns of great economic hardship and uncertainty, with resources diminishing relative to needs and rising expectations.

Few city governments in the developing world hav e the power, resources, and trained staff to provid e their rapidly growing populations with the land, services , and facilities needed for an adequate human life: clean water, sanitation, schools, and transport. The resu lt is mushrooming illegal settlements with primitiv e facilities, increased overcrowding, and rampant disease linked to an unhealthy environment. Box 9-1 Dominating Cities Nairobi, Kenya: In 1975, Nairobi had 57 per cent of all Kenya's manufacturing employment and two-third s of its industrial plants. In 1979, Nairobi contained aroun d 5 per cent of the national population. Manila, Philippines: Metropolitan Manila produces o ne-third of the nation's gross national product, ha ndles 70 per cent of all imports, and contains 60 per cent o f the manufacturing establishments. In 1981, it con tained around 13 per cent of the national population. Lima, Peru: The metropolitan area of Lima accounts for 43 per cent of gross domestic product, for four -fifths of bank credit and consumer goods production, and for more than nine-tenths of capital goods production i n Peru. In 1981, it was home to around 21 per cent of Peruv ians. Lagos, Nigeria: In 1978, Lagos' metropolitan area h andled over 40 per cent of the nation's external tr ade, accounted for over 57 per cent of total value added in manufacturing, and contained over 40 per cent o f Nigeria's highly skilled workers. It contains only some 5 per cent of the national population. Mexico City, Mexico: In 1970, with some 24 per cent of Mexicans living there, the capital contained 30 per cent of the manufacturing jobs, 28 per cent of employmen t in commerce, 38 per cent of jobs in services, 69 per cent of employment in national government, 62 per cent o f national investment in higher education, and 80 p er cent of research activities. In 1965, it contained 44 pe r cent of national bank deposits and 61 per cent of national credits. Sao Paulo, Brazil: Greater Sao Paulo, with around o ne-tenth of Brazil's national population in 1980, c ontributed one-quarter of the net national product and over 40 per cent of Brazil's industrial value-added.

In most Third World cities, the enormous pressu re for shelter and services has frayed the urban fa bric. Much of the housing used by the poor is decrepit. C ivic buildings are frequently in a state of disrepa ir and advanced decay. So too is the essential infrastruct ure of the city; public transport is overcrowded an d overused, as are roads, buses and trains, transport stations, public latrines, and washing points. Water supply systems leak, and the resulting low water pressure allows s ewage to seep into drinking water. A large proporti on of the city's population often has no piped water, storm d rainage, or roads. /7 Given the distribution of incomes, given the forese eable availability of resources national, local, an d worldwide given present technology, and given the present wea kness of local government and the lack of interest of national governments in settlement problems, I don' t see any solution for the Third World city. Third World cities are and they will increasingly b ecome centres of competition for a plot to be invad ed where you can build a shelter, for a room to rent, for a bed in a hospital, for a seat in a school or in a b us, essentially for the fewer stable adequately paid jobs, even for the space in a square or on a sidewalk where you c an display and sell your merchandise, on which so many households depend. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. The people themselves organize and help construct m ost new housing units in Third World cities and the y do so without the assistance from architects, planners , and engineers, nor from local or national governm ents. Furthermore, in many cases, national and local gove rnments are frequently harassing these groups. The people themselves are becoming increasingly the tru e builders and designers of Third World cities and quite often the managers of their own districts. Jorge Hardoy International Institute for Environment and Develop ment WCED Public Hearing Sao Paulo, 28-29 Oct 1985 11. A growing number of the urban poor suffer from a high incidence of diseases; most are environmenta lly based and could be prevented or dramatically reduce d through relatively small investments. (See Box 9- 2.) Acute respiratory diseases, tuberculosis, intestina l parasites, and diseases linked to poor sanitation and contaminated drinking water (diarrhoea, dysentery, hepatitis, and typhoid) are usually endemic; they a re one of the major causes of illness and death, especially a mong children. In parts of many cities, poor people can expect to see one in four of their children die of serious malnutrition before the age of five, or one adult in two suffering intestinal worms or serious respiratory i nfections. /8 12. Air and water pollution might be assumed to be less pressing in Third World cities because of lowe r levels of industrial development. But in fact hundreds of such cities have high concentrations of industry. A ir, water, noise, and solid waste pollution problems have incr eased rapidly and can have dramatic impacts on the life and health of city inhabitants, on their economy, and o n jobs. Even in a relatively small city, just one o r two factories dumping wastes into the only nearby river can conta minate everyone's drinking, washing, and cooking wa ter. Many slums and shanties crowd close to hazardous in dustries, as this is land no one else wants. This p roximity has magnified the risks for the poor, a fact demons trated by great loss of life and human suffering in various recent industrial accidents. Box 9-2 Environmental Problems in Third World Cities Out of India's 3,119 towns and cities, only 209 had partial and only 8 had full sewage and sewage trea tment facilities. On the river Ganges, 114 cities each wi th 50,000 or more inhabitants dump untreated sewage into the river every day. DDT factories, tanneries, paper an d pulp mills, petrochemical and fertilizer complexe s, rubber factories, and a host of others use the river to ge t rid of their wastes. The Hoogly estuary (near Cal cutta) is choked with untreated industrial wastes from more t han 150 major factories around Calcutta. Sixty per cent of Calcutta's population suffer from pneumonia, bronch itis, and other respiratory diseases related to air pollution. Chinese industries, most of which use coal in outda ted furnaces and boilers, are concentrated around 2 0 cities and ensure a high level of air pollution. Lung canc er mortality in Chinese cities is four to seven tim es higher than in the nation as a whole, and the difference i s largely attributable to heavy air pollution. In Malaysia, the highly urbanized Klang Valley (whi ch includes the capital, Kuala Lumpur) has two to t hree times the pollution levels of major cities in the U nited States, and the Klang river system is heavily contaminated with agricultural and industrial efflu ents and sewage.

The uncontrolled physical expansion of cities h as also had serious implications for the urban envi ronment and economy. Uncontrolled development makes provisi on of housing, roads, water supply, sewers, and pub lic services prohibitively expensive. Cities are often built on the most productive agricultural land, and unguided growth results in the unnecessary loss of this land . Such losses are most serious in nations with limi ted arable United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. land, such as Egypt. Haphazard development also con sumes land and natural landscapes needed for urban parks and recreation areas. Once an area is built u p, it is both difficult and expensive to re-create open space. 14. In general, urban growth has often preceded the establishment of a solid, diversified economic bas e to support the build-up of housing, infrastructure, an d employment. In many places, the problems are link ed to inappropriate patterns of industrial development an d the lack of coherence between strategies for agri cultural and urban development. The link between national ec onomies and international economic factors has been discussed in Part I of this report. The world econo mic crisis of the 1980s has not only reduced income s, increased unemployment, and eliminated many social programmes, it has also exacerbated the already low priority given to urban problems, increasing the ch ronic shortfall in resources needed to build, maint ain, and manage urban areas. /9 2. The Situation in Industrial World Cities 15. The Commission's focus on the urban crisis in d eveloping countries is not meant to imply that what transpires in the cities of the industrial world is not of crucial importance to sustainable developme nt globally. It is. These cities account for a high share of the wo rld's resource use, energy consumption, and environ mental pollution. Many have a global reach and draw their resources and energy from distant lands, with enorm ous aggregate impacts on the ecosystems of those lands. 16. Nor is the emphasis on Third World cities meant to imply that problems within the cities of indust rialized countries are not serious. They are. Many face prob lems of deteriorating infrastructure, environmental degradation, inner-city decay, and neighbourhood co llapse. The unemployed, the elderly, and racial and ethnic minorities can remain trapped in a downward spiral of degradation and poverty, as job opportunities an d the younger and better-educated individuals leave decli ning neighbourhoods. City or municipal governments often face a legacy of poorly designed and maintained pub lic housing estates, mounting costs, and declining tax bases. 17. But most industrial countries have the means an d resources to tackle inner-city decay and linked e conomic decline. Indeed, many have succeeded in reversing t hese trends through enlightened policies, cooperati on between the public and private sectors, and signifi cant investments in personnel, institutions, and te chnological innovation. /10 Local authorities usually have the political power and credibility to take initiatives and to assess and deploy resources in innovative ways reflecting unique local conditions. This gives them a capacity to manage, control, experiment, and lead urban develop ment. In centrally planned economies, the ability t o plan and implement plans for urban development has been significant. The priority given to collective goods over private consumption may also have increased the res ources available for urban development. 18. The physical environment in many cities of the industrial world has improved substantially over th e decades. According to the historical records of man y major centres - like London, Paris, Chicago, Mosc ow, and Melbourne - it was not too long ago that a major pa rt of their population lived in desperate circumsta nces amid gross pollution. Conditions have improved steadily during the past century, and this trend continues, although the pace varies between and within cities. Large cities by definition are centralized, manmade environments that depend mainly on food, water, en ergy, and other goods from outside. Smaller cities, by co ntrast, can be the heart of community-based develop ment and provide services to the surrounding countryside . Given the importance of cities, special efforts, an d safeguards are needed to ensure that the resource s they demand are produced sustainably and that urban dwel lers participate in decisions affecting their lives . Residential areas are likely to be more habitable i f they are governed as individual neighbourhoods wi th direct local participation. To the extent that energy and other needs can be met on a local basis, both the c ity and surrounding areas will be better off.

In most urban areas, almost everyone is served by refuse collection today. Air quality has general ly improved, with a decline in the emission of particl es and sulphur oxides. Efforts to restore water qua lity have met with a mixed record of success because of pollu tion from outside of cities, notably nitrates and o ther fertilizers and pesticides. Many coastal areas, how ever, close to major sewage outlets, show considera ble deterioration. There is rising concern about chemic al pollutants in drinking water and about the impac ts of toxic wastes on groundwater quality. And noise pollution has tended to increase. 20. Motor vehicles greatly influence environmental conditions in the cities of the industrial world. A recent slowdown in the growth rate of vehicle numbers, str icter emission standards for new vehicles, the dist ribution of lead-free gasoline, improvements in fuel efficiency , improved traffic management policies, and landsca ping have all helped reduce the impacts of urban traffic . 21. Public opinion has played a critical role in th e drive to improve urban conditions. In some cities , public pressure has triggered the abandonment of massive u rban development projects, fostered residential sch emes on a more human scale, countered indiscriminate dem olition of existing buildings and historic district s, modified proposed urban highway construction, and led to tra nsformation of derelict plots into playgrounds. 22. The problems that remain are serious but they a ffect relatively limited areas, which makes them mu ch more tractable than those of Cairo or Mexico City, for e xample. Certain aspects of urban decline even provi de opportunities for environmental enhancement. The ex odus of population and economic activities, while c reating severe economic and social difficulties, reduces ur ban congestion, allows new uses for abandoned build ings, protects historic urban districts from the threat o f speculative demolition and reconstruction, and co ntributes to urban renewal. The de-industrialization of these ci ties is often counterbalanced by the growth of the services sector, which brings its own problems. But this tre nd creates opportunities to remove heavy industrial pollution sources from residential and commercial areas. 23. The combination of advanced technology, stronge r national economies, and a developed institutional infrastructure give resilience and the potential fo r continuing recovery to cities in the industrial w orld. With flexibility, space for manoeuvre, and innovation by local leadership, the issue for industrial countri es is ultimately one of political and social choice. Deve loping countries are not in the same situation. The y have a major urban crisis on their hands. II. The Urban Challenge in Developing Countries 24. Settlements - the urban network of cities, town s, and villages - encompass all aspects of the envi ronment within which societies' economic and social interac tions take place. Internationally, the major cities of the world constitute a network for the allocation of investme nt and for the production and sale of most goods an d services. These centres are the first to be plugged into this network, through air- and seaports and telecommunications. New technologies usually arrive and are first put into practice in large and then smaller cities. Only if centres are firmly connected to thi s network can they hope to attract investment in te chnologies and manufacturing goods for world markets. National ly, cities are veritable incubators of economic act ivities. Some enterprises are large-scale but the vast major ity are small, doing everything from selling snack foods to mending shoes and building houses. The growth of th ese activities is the foundation of the domestic ec onomy. 1. National Urban Strategies 25. The natural evolution of this network of settle ments, however, has caused apprehension in most dev eloping countries. Of particular concern has been the pheno menal growth of often one or two major cities. In s ome countries, the desire to limit this growth has led to spatial policies designed to accelerate the deve lopment of secondary centres. Underlying this has been a parti cular concern that unbalanced growth is increasing interregional disparities and creating economic and social imbalances that can have serious consequenc es in terms of national unity and political stability. 26. Although far from conclusive, the available evi dence suggests that most attempts by central govern ments to balance spatial development have been both expensiv e and ineffective. Major macroeconomic, social, and sectoral policies have often been directly opposed to the decentralization policy. Investments support ed by governments and aid agencies have followed the same centralizing logic as private investments, and hav e built transportation facilities, educational and health i nstitutions, and urban infrastructure and services where the United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. demand exists - in the major city. Rural-urban migr ation has followed the same pattern. A major reason why so many migrants in recent decades went to cities such as Nairobi, Manila, Lagos, Mexico City, Sao Paulo, Rangoon, or Port au Prince was the dominant role ea ch centre came to play in its national economy. We see that the increasing urban drift is inevitabl e: There are a lot of 'push' factors working in the rural areas. Rural pluralization is caused by absence of land re form, by the increase of absentee landownership, by the displacement of the Green Revolution. Resides the 'push' factors of the rural areas, ther e are, of course, the 'pull' factors, the glamour o f the Big city, the higher pay of urban jobs as compared to rural i ncome possibilities. So the informal sector of Jaka rta has grown; maybe from the 7 million population of Jakar ta, 3 or 4 million - at least two-thirds - are the result of the urban drift. George Adicondro Director, Irian Jaya, Rural Community Development F oundation WCED Public Hearing Jakarta, 26 March 1985 27. The macroeconomic and pricing policies pursued by governments further reinforced this concentratio n. The major cities, often the capital, usually receive a disproportionately large share of the total nationa l expenditure on education and on subsidies to reduce the prices of water, corn, electric power, diesel fuel, and pu blic transport. Railroad freight rates sometimes favour routes that pass through the capital. Property taxe s in the city and surrounding districts may be undervalued. New or expanded industries given a boost by the imp ort substitution policies are encouraged to establish i n or near the capital. /11 28. Agricultural and food policies have also tended to promote rapid growth of larger cities. Low or e ven negative economic supports for agricultural product s have driven smallholders off their land and added to the numbers of the rural poor. Urban food prices, held low by subsidies, have served to attract many of th em to cities. In recent years, however, some developing c ountries have found it possible to begin to shift m ore income from the major cities to the rural areas and smalle r towns. In some cases, policies to promote small landholdings and intensive farming have had this ef fect. Increasing production, a growth in agricultur al employment, and higher average incomes have stimula ted the development of small and intermediate centr es in the agricultural regions they serve. /12 29. There are some important lessons to be learned about spatial strategies for urban development: Nothing much short of coercion will prevent the gr owth of the major city in the early stages of development. The key to successful intervention is timing, to e ncourage deconcentration only when the advantages o f concentration are diminishing. Avoid policy interventions that increase the attra ctiveness of the major city, particularly subsidies on food and energy, overly generous provision of urban infr astructure and other services, and excessive concentration of administrative power in the capita l. The best way to encourage the growth of secondary centres is to build on the natural economic advantages of their regions, especially in resource processing and marketing, and the decentralized provision of government services. Rural and urban development strategies and approac hes should be complementary rather than contradictory: The development of secondary centres is to the direct economic benefit of the resource areas they serve. 30. The job opportunities and housing provided by c ities are essential to absorb the population growth that the countryside cannot cope with; as long as price cont rols and subsidies do not interfere, the urban mark et should offer advantages to rural producers. But there are obviously conflicts of interest between developing country city-dwellers and farmers. A major thrust of the di scussion on food security (see Chapter 5 ) was to assert the importance of decisively turning the 'terms of trad e' in favour of farmers, especially small farmers, through United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. pricing and exchange rate policies. Many developing countries are not implementing such policies, part ly for fear of losing the support of politically powerful urban factions. Thus they fail both to stem urban d rift and to improve food security. 31. These considerations can provide the basis for developing an explicit national settlements strateg y and policies within which innovative and effective loca l solutions to urban problems can evolve and flouri sh. Every government has such a strategy in effect, but it is most often implicit in a range of macroeconomic, f iscal, budget, energy, and agricultural policies. These po licies have usually evolved incrementally in respon se to the pressures of the day and, almost invariably, they c ontradict each other and the stated settlement goal s of the government. A national urban strategy could provide an explicit set of goals and priorities for the de velopment of a nation's urban system and the large, intermedi ate, and small centres within it. Such a strategy m ust go beyond physical or spatial planning, it requires th at governments take a much broader view of urban po licy than has been traditional. 32. With an explicit strategy, nations can begin to reorient those central economic and major sectoral policies that now reinforce megacity growth, urban decline, and poverty. They can likewise promote more effecti vely the development of small and intermediate urban centres , the strengthening of their local governments, and the establishment of services and facilities needed to attract development initiatives and investment. Min istries of Planning, Finance, Industry, Agriculture, and so on would have clear goals and criteria against which to assess the effects of their policies and expenditures on u rban development. Contradictory policies and progra mmes could be changed. At the very least, the spatial bi ases inherent in macroeconomic and fiscal policies, annual budgets, pricing structures, and sectoral investmen t plans could be exposed and assessed. Within such a strategy, the traditional tools of urban policy, in cluding land use planning and control, would stand a better chance of being effective. 33. The formulation of such a strategy is clearly a central government responsibility. Beyond this, ho wever, the role of central governments should be primarily to strengthen the capacity of local governments to fin d and carry through effective solutions to local urban pr oblems and stimulate local opportunities. 2. Strengthening Local Authorities 34. The institutional and legal structures of local government in most developing nations are inadequa te for these purposes. In most African and Asian nations t he structure of urban government goes hack to the c olonial period and was designed to deal with predominantly rural and agricultural societies. It was never inte nded to cope with rapid urbanization or to manage cities of several million inhabitants. Newly independent gov ernments inherited a framework of laws and procedures totall y inappropriate to deal with the urban processes th ey were about to confront. Yet in many nations, this inheri ted framework remains largely in place. 35. Where the immediate colonial past is less evide nt, as in most Latin American nations, the politica l, institutional, and legal frameworks for local gover nment are often just as inappropriate and inadequat e. As in Asia and Africa, most are based on models imported from Europe or North America. This has made it diff icult for them to influence the direction of urbanization and to manage the problems of large, rapidly expan ding urban centres. It has created cities that are energ y and material-intensive and dependent on imports, and that add to the burden on the national economy, includin g pressures on trade and balance of payments. 36. Urban development cannot be based on standardiz ed models, imported or indigenous. Development possibilities are particular to each city and must be assessed within the context of its own region. W hat works in one city may be totally inappropriate in another. A lthough technical help from central agencies may be needed, only a strong local government can ensure that the needs, customs, urban forms, social priorities, and environmental conditions of the local area are refl ected in local plans for urban development. But loc al authorities have not been given the political power , decision making capacity, and access to revenues needed to carry out their functions. This leads to frustra tion, to continuing criticism of local government f or insufficient and inefficient services, and to a downward spiral of weakness feeding on weakness. A lot of youth in the Third World countries and eve n adults are unemployed. We want simple technologie s whereby one particular person can do a kind of a jo b that could have provided job opportunities to sev eral hundreds. What are we doing with the surplus potent ial energy? So again I say that development is peop le, it is not high technology, it is not modernization, it is not westernization. But it should be culturally re levant. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. Jan Selego World Vision International WCED Public Hearing Nairobi, 23 Sept 1986 37. The lack of political access is a major weaknes s of local government in many developing countries. Most local governments have difficulties getting enough revenue to cover their operating expenses, let alon e to make new investments to extend services and facilities. Even richer city governments have access to the equ ivalent of only $10-50 per inhabitant to invest each year. Despite these weaknesses, the trend in recent decad es has been for national governments to reduce the financi al capacity of local governments in real terms. 38. The result is growing centralization and contin uing weaknesses at both the central and local level . Instead of doing a few things well, central authorities end up doing too many things, none of them well. Human and financial resources get stretched too thin. Local g overnments do not gain the expertise, authority, an d credibility needed to deal with local problems. 39. To become key agents of development, city gover nments need enhanced political, institutional, and financial capacity, notably access to more of the w ealth generated in the city. Only in this way can c ities adapt and deploy some of the vast array of tools availabl e to address urban problems - tools such as land ti tle registration, land use control, and tax sharing. 3. Self-Reliance and Citizen Involvement 40. In most developing countries between one-fourth and one-half of the economically active urban popu lation cannot find adequate, stable livelihoods. With few jobs available in established businesses or governm ent services, people have to find or create their own s ources of income. These efforts have resulted in th e rapid growth of what has been termed the 'informal sector ', which provides much of the cheap goods and servi ces essential to city economies, business, and consumer s. 41. Thus, while many poor people may not be officia lly employed, most are working - in unregistered fa ctories end construction firms, selling goods on street cor ners, making clothes in their homes, or as servants or guards in better-off neighbourhoods. Most of the so-called unemployed are in fact working 10-15 hours a day, six to seven days a week. Their problem is not so much und eremployment as underpayment. 42. Most house building, maintenance, or upgrading in the cities of developing countries is done outsi de official plans and usually in illegal settlements. This proc ess mobilizes untapped resources, contributes to ca pital formation, and stimulates employment. These informa l sector builders represent an important source of urban employment, in particular for low and unskilled lab our. They are not capital- or technology-intensive, they are not energy-intensive, and as a rule they do not imp ose a drain on foreign exchange. In their way, they contribute their share to attaining some of the nat ion's major development objectives. Moreover, they are flexible in responding to local needs and demands, catering in particular to poorer households, which usually have nowhere else to turn. Many governments have be gun to see the wisdom of tolerating rather than quashing their work. Large-scale bulldozing of squa tter communities is now rarer, although it still ha ppens. 43. Governments should give more support to the inf ormal sector, recognizing its vital functions in ur ban development. Some governments have done so, facilit ating loans and credit to small entrepreneurs, buil ding cooperatives, and neighbourhood improvement associa tions. Providing tenure to those living in illegal settlements is basic to this process, as is easing some building and housing regulations. 44. Multilateral and bilateral development assistan ce agencies should follow suit, and some are beginn ing to do so. Non-governmental and private voluntary organiza tions are springing up in many countries to provide cost- effective channels for assistance, ensuring that it gets to those who can use it. A much larger propor tion of assistance could be channelled directly through the se organizations. 45. The above measures would also reinforce self-re liance and local governance by the poor in their ow n neighbourhood associations. Left to their own devic es, the poor in many Third World cities have organi zed to fill gaps in services left by the local government. Amon g other things, community groups mobilize and organ ize United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. fund-raising or mutual self-help to deal with secur ity, environmental, and health problems within the immediate area. 46. Governments should move from a position of neut rality or antagonism to active support for such eff orts. A few have actually institutionalized such programmes so that public ministries or agencies work continu ously with community organizations. In the Indian city of Hyderabad, for example, an Urban Community Develop ment Department set up by the municipal corporation work s directly with community groups and non-government organizations in poorer neighbourhoods. By 1983, so me 223 organizations had been formed by residents i n low-income areas, plus 135 youth organizations and 99 women's groups. /13 In this way governments can become partners and sponsors of the people who are the main builders of their cities. The shantytowns have found their own technique, the ir own resources without any assistance from anyone else, and they solved their housing problems. The r eal problem is not that. It is the poverty, the lac k of planning, the lack of technical assistance, the lack of finan cing to buy construction materials, the lack of urb an equipment. To change this housing policy for human settlements , they should stimulate self-construction, instead of financing these large housing complexes. It would h ave been much better and would have cost less to he lp the people to carry out the self-construction. Generally speaking, it seems clear that without mee ting the basic needs of human beings, concern for t he environment has to be secondary. Man has to survive , answer, and attend first to his basic survival ne eds - food, housing, sanitation - and then to the environ ment. Walter Pinto Costa President, Environmental and Sanitation Association WCED Public Hearing Sao Paulo, 28-29 Oct 1985 4. Housing and Services for the Poor 47. In most developing-world cities, there is littl e low-cost housing. Generally those on low incomes either rent rooms - whether in tenements or cheap boarding-hous es, or in someone else's house or shack - or they b uild or buy a house or shack in an illegal settlement. T here are many kinds and degrees of illegality, and these influence the extent to which governments tolerate the existence of such settlements, or even provide them with public services and facilities. 48. Whatever form it takes, low-income accommodatio n generally shares three characteristics. First, it has inadequate or no infrastructure and services - incl uding piped water, sewers, or other means of hygien ically disposing of human wastes. Second, people live in c rowded and cramped conditions under which communicable diseases can flourish, particularly wh en malnutrition lowers resistance. Third, poor peop le usually build on land ill-suited for human habitati on: floodplains, dusty deserts, hills subject to la ndslide, or next to polluting industries. They choose these sites be cause the land's low commercial value means they st and a better chance of not being evicted. 49. Landownership structures and the inability or u nwillingness of governments to intervene in these s tructures are perhaps the main factors contributing to 'illeg al' settlements and chaotic urban sprawl. When half or more of a city's workforce has no chance of obtaining a leg al plot on which a house can be built, let alone of affording to buy or rent a house legally, the balance between pr ivate landownership rights and the public good must be quickly rethought. 50. Given urbanization trends in most developing co untries, there is no time to wait for slow and unce rtain programmes. Government intervention must be reorien ted so that limited resources are put to maximum ef fect in improving housing conditions for the poor. The o ptions for intervention are many (see Box 9-3), but governments should be guided by these seven priorit ies: provide legal tenure to those living in 'illegal' settlements, with secure titles and basic services provided by public authorities; United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. ensure that the land and other resources people ne ed to build or improve their housing are available; supply existing and new housing areas with infrast ructure and services; set up neighbourhood offices to provide advice and technical assistance on how housing can be built better and cheaper, and on how health and hygiene c an be improved; plan and guide the city's physical expansion to an ticipate and encompass needed land for new housing, agricultural land, parks, and children's play areas ; consider how public intervention could improve con ditions for tenants and those living in cheap roomi ng or boarding-houses; and change housing finance systems to make cheap loans available to lower-income and community groups. 51. Most cities urgently need a large and continuou s increase in the availability of cheap housing plo ts convenient to the main centres of employment. Only government intervention can achieve this, but no ge neral prescriptions are possible. Societies differ too mu ch in how they view private landownership and land use rights, in how they use different instruments such as direct grants, tax write-offs, or deduction of m ortgage interest, and in how they treat land speculation, c orruption, and other undesirable activities that of ten accompany processes of this kind. Although the mean s are particular to each nation, the end must be th e same: governments ensuring that there are cheaper, better-serviced, better-located, legal alternatives to illegal plots. If this need is not met, the uncontrolled gr owth of cities - and its accompanying high costs - will not be stopped. 52. Besides land, building materials are another ma jor cost for people putting up their own houses. Go vernment support for the production of materials and of cert ain structural components, fixtures, and fittings c ould reduce housing costs and create many jobs. Small neighbour hood workshops often have cost advantages because o f the low cost of transport from the workshop to the building site. Box 9-3 Three Ways to Use $20 Million to Improve Conditions in a City of 1 Million Option 1: Build 2,000 public housing units for poor families (with an average of six family members), each costi ng $10,000. Conditions are improved for 12,000 people, but little cost recovery is possible for poor fami lies. If the city's population grows at 5 per cent annually, 630 .000 new inhabitants will be added over 10 years, s o only a tiny fraction of total population will have benefit ed. Option 2: Establish a 'site-and-service scheme', whereby poor families are responsible for building their houses on an allocated site supplied with piped water, connectio n to a sewer system, and electricity, roads, and dr ainage. At $2,000 per plot, this means housing for some 60,000 people - about 10 per cent of the city's populatio n growth over 10 years. Option 3: Allocate $100,000 to a neighbourhood organization r epresenting 1,000 poor households (6,000 people) in an existing low-income settlement. It chooses to impro ve drainage and roads, build a health clinic, estab lish a cooperative to produce inexpensive building materia ls and components, and reblock the settlement to im prove access roads and provide 50 new plots. With $10 mil lion, 100 such community initiatives are supported, reaching 600,000 people and providing 5,000 new hou sing plots. Many new jobs are stimulated. The remai ning $10 million is spent on installing piped water; at $100 per household, all 600,000 people reached. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 53. The majority of building codes and standards ar e ignored because following them would produce buil dings too expensive for most people. A more effective app roach might be to set up neighbourhood offices to p rovide technical advice on how health and safety can be im proved at minimum cost. Good professional advice ca n lower building costs and improve quality, and might be more effective than prescribing what can or can not be built. 54. Many poor people rent accommodation; half or mo re of a city's entire population may be tenants. In creasing the availability of house sites, materials, and cre dits does little for those who must rent. One possi bility is financial support to non-governmental, non-profit o rganizations to purchase end develop property speci fically for rental units. A second is support for tenants t o buy out landlords and convert tenancy into cooper ative ownership. 55. Governments, especially those strapped for reso urces, may claim that piped water supplies and sewa ge disposal systems are too expensive. As a consequenc e, poor people may have to pay water vendors far mo re per litre of water than middle- or upper-income gro ups pay public agencies to pipe water into their ho mes. Western water-borne sewage systems and treatment pl ants may be prohibitively expensive. But other techniques and systems cost between one-tenth and o ne-twentieth as much per household, and most of the se use much less water. Moreover, lower-cost technolog y can be upgraded over time, as money becomes available. /14 56. Major improvements can be made relatively cheap ly in all these areas. But costs will remain low on ly if low- income groups are encouraged to participate fully i n defining what they need, in deciding what they wi ll contribute to the new services, and in doing the jo b with their own hands. This cooperation depends on establishing the new relationship between citizens and government called for earlier. 5. Tapping More Resources 57. The available resources in or close to cities a re often underused. Many landowners leave well-loca ted sites undeveloped in order to benefit later from their in creasing value as the city grows. Many public agenc ies have land that could be put to better use, such as the a rea next to stations and harbours controlled by rai lway and port authorities. Several countries have introduced special programmes to encourage public and private cooperation in the development of such lands, a tre nd that should be encouraged. There is a general ne ed to find innovative and effective ways of pooling land for the common good. Most cities have mechanisms fo r acquiring land either at market rates (which means that schemes are never implemented), or at arbitrar ily low confiscatory rates (where the alliance of political forces and landlords blocks the acquisition anyway ). 58. Governments should also consider supporting urb an agriculture. This may have less relevance in cit ies where land markets are highly commercialized and la nd for housing is in short supply. But in most citi es, especially those with less commercialized land mark ets, considerable potential exists. Many African ci ties already realize this. Urban agriculture, especially on city fringes, is undertaken by people as a way to feed themselves, in other instances, the process is more commercialized, with enterprises specializing in v egetable production for sale within the city. 59. Officially sanctioned and promoted urban agricu lture could become an important component of urban development and make more food available to the urb an poor. The primary purposes of such promotion sho uld be to improve the nutritional and health standards of the poor, help their family budgets (50-70 per c ent of which is usually spent on food), enable them to ear n some additional income, and provide employment. U rban agriculture can also provide fresher and cheaper pr oduce, more green space, the clearing of garbage du mps, and recycling of household waste. /15 I'm an expert in slum dwelling. We're establishing a small, tiny organization trying to organize slum dwellers, because we see so many slums. Slums in the city, sl ums in the villages, slums in the forests. I have worked for four years to motivate my fellow slum dwellers to become transmigrants, and they fin ally migrated to ten places all over Indonesia. They are still in very good communication with me. They're still sending me letters, and they say that life is not b etter in the transmigration areas. Living in the sh adows in the urban slums or living in the shadows in the transmi gration site is just the same. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. When I go back to my people, the slum dwellers, ton ight they will ask me what I have got from this mee ting in the big hotel. They won't ask for information, just 'Have you brought some money for us to build new h ouses?' Syamsuddin Nainggolan Founder, Yayasan Panca Bakti WCED Public Hearing Jakarta, 26 March 1986 60. Another poorly used resource is solid wastes, t he disposal of which has become a major problem in many cities, with much of it dumped and uncollected. Pro moting the reclamation, reuse, or recycling of mate rials can reduce the problem of solid waste, stimulate employ ment, and result in savings of raw materials. Compo sting can support urban agriculture. If a municipal gover nment lacks the resources to collect household wast es regularly, it can support existing community-based schemes. In many cities, literally thousands of peo ple already make a living sorting through wastes by han d on municipal tips. Investing in a more capital-in tensive, automatic recycling plant could be doubly counterpr oductive if it unnecessarily consumes scarce capita l or if a plant would destroy many people's livelihoods. But an immediate need here is to give health advice and provide health care services to those who are making a livi ng off municipal tips. /16 III. International Cooperation 61. The future will be predominantly urban, and the most immediate environmental concerns of most peop le will be urban ones. The effectiveness of efforts to impr ove urban life depends largely on the health of nat ional economies. In many developing countries, this is li nked closely to the state of the world economy. An improvement in international economic relations (se e Chapter 3 ) would perhaps do more than anything else to enhance the capacity of developing countries to add ress their linked urban and environmental problems. But beyond that is the need to strengthen cooperation a mong developing countries and to increase various t ypes of direct support from the international community. 1. Cooperation Among Developing Countries 62. Developing countries can do a great deal togeth er to develop the policy concepts, programmes, and institutions needed to tackle the urban crisis they share. Although the management problems confrontin g Caracas, Dakar, or Delhi have little relevance to t hose confronting London or Paris, the cities of Lat in America, West Africa, or South Asia have much in common. As they formulate broad national urban strategies, it is important that they share experiences on the manage ment of their growing megacities, on the developmen t of small and intermediate centres, on strengthening lo cal government, on upgrading illegal settlements, o n crisis- response measures, and on a range of other problems that are more or less unique to the Third World. 63. Further research could provide the basis for re thinking the Third World city. It could also feed i n-country training programmes (or, for smaller nations, regio nal training programmes) for city and municipal gov ernment staff. Good policy proposals and good training cour ses depend on good local information and analysis; far too little of all three of these is found within develo ping countries and cities. 2. International Support 64. A greater flow of international resources is re quired to support the efforts of developing countri es to tackle the unfolding urban crisis. An agreed definition of 'urban development assistance' does not exist, but the Development Assistance Committee recently estimated that total bilateral and multilateral aid for urba n programmes averaged about $900 million per year ove r 1980-84. /17 It is also estimated that to date fewer than 5 per cent of the developing world's urban populati on has been reached by a housing or neighbourhood upgrading project sponsored by a development assist ance agency. This level of support needs to be incr eased significantly. Moreover, the scope of support shoul d be broadened and its quality and terms improved. 65. In addition, development assistance agencies sh ould increase aid and technical assistance in three areas: to set up infrastructure funds for local governmen ts; United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. to undertake tasks such as reorganizing local tax assessments and collection, preparing or updating maps of property ownership, and setting up technica l teams to advise households and community groups on improving housing; for in-country training courses and on-the job tra ining for local officials. 66. Part of the increased aid should go directly to community groups, using intermediaries such as nat ional or international NGOs. Several bilateral aid programme s have already demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of this approach; various NGOs have been responsible for ma ny successful community based schemes to improve housing and provide basic services. They are genera lly more successful at reaching the poorest. More a id should also go to supporting independent research g roups working in housing and urban issues, particul arly those providing advice to local governments and com munity groups; many are doing so already, especiall y in Latin America. Box 9-4 Misunderstanding Women's Needs in Housing Projects Housing projects often use a gridiron layout that d oes not allow women to work in their house and at t he same time keep an eye on their own or their neighbours' children. House designs and plot sizes rarely consi der the fact that many women will want to use their houses as workshops (to make clothes, for instance) or as shops, which in fact are often forbidden in low-income hou sing projects. Application procedure for low-income housing sometimes requires 'husbands' to apply; this exclud es women-headed households - between 30 and 50 per cent of all households. Women's special needs in di fferent cultures are ignored - in Islamic societies , for example, women's need for private open space within the house is rarely considered in house designs, w hile their need for relatively sheltered pathways to get to shops and clinics is not acknowledged in site l ayouts. Source: Based on C.O.N. Moser, 'Housing Gender Awareness Approach', Working Paper #71, Development Planning Unit, London, 1985. 67. International cooperation can also contribute t o developing low cost technologies for urban needs and studying ways of meeting the housing needs of women . (See Box 9-4.) 68. Many technical agencies within the UN system ha ve the appropriate knowledge bases to play a valuab le role in advising and supporting governments, notabl y the UN Centre for Human Settlements (UNCHS, or Habitat). They should identify the information and guidelines that city governments need and the form in which it can be made accessible and usable by them. This could be patterned, for example, upon the ongoing e fforts to prepare guidebooks for community workers on iden tifying disease vectors and mobilizing communities to deal with them, and on interventions to promote chi ld survival and health. More generally. Habitat can strengthen international cooperation at the global level, as in the UN International Year of Shelter for the Homeless . The capacity of the UN system to provide leadersh ip on human settlements issues through Habitat needs to be strengthened.

The traditional forms of national sovereignty ar e increasingly challenged by the realities of ecolo gical and economic interdependence. Nowhere is this more true than in shared ecosystems and in 'the global commo ns' - those parts of the planet that fall outside natio nal jurisdictions. Here, sustainable development ca n be secured only through international cooperation and agreed r egimes for surveillance, development, and managemen t in the common interest. But at stake is not just the s ustainable development of shared ecosystems and the commons, but of all nations whose development depen ds to a greater or lesser extent on their rational management. 2. By the same token, without agreed, equitable, an d enforceable rules governing the rights and duties of states in respect of the global commons, the pressure of d emands on finite resources will destroy their ecolo gical integrity over time. Future generations will be imp overished, and the people who suffer most will be t hose who live in poor countries that can least assert their own claims in a free-for-all. 3. Management of the various commons - the oceans, outer space, and Antarctica - is at different stage s of evolution, as is the very 'commonality' of these ar eas. In the Law of the Sea , the international community has developed one of the most ambitious and advanced of international conventions ever for the seas and th e sea- bed. But a few countries have so far declined to ad here to the multilateral regime that had been the s ubject of protracted global negotiations, and this is blockin g implementation of certain key aspects. Boundaries have been drawn on the oceans to separate the common sea s from national Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), bu t as the common and claimed waters form interlocked e cological and economic systems, and as the health o f one depends on the health of the other, both are di scussed in this chapter. As for outer space, the le ast tapped global commons, discussion of joint management has only just begun. Antarctica has been covered for ov er a quarter of a century by a binding Treaty. Many stat es that are not party to it feel they should by rig ht have a stake in the management of what they see as a part of the global commons. I. Oceans: The Balance of Life 4. In the Earth's wheel of life, the oceans provide the balance. /1 Covering over 70 per cent of the planet's surface, they play a critical role in maintaining i ts life-support systems, in moderating its climate, and in sustaining animals and plants, including minute, ox ygen-producing phytoplankton. They provide protein, transportation, energy, employment, recreation, and other economic, social, and cultural activities. 5. The oceans also provide the ultimate sink for th e by-products of human activities. Huge, closed sep tic tanks, they receive wastes from cities, farms, and industr ies via sewage outfalls, dumping from barges and sh ips, coastal run-off, river discharge, and even atmosphe ric transport. In the last few decades, the growth of the world economy, the burgeoning demand for food and f uel, and accumulating discharges of wastes have beg un to press against the bountiful limits of the oceans . 6. The oceans are marked by a fundamental unity fro m which there is no escape, interconnected cycles o f energy, climate, marine living resources, and human activities move through coastal waters, regional s eas, and the closed oceans. The effects of urban, industrial , and agricultural growth are contained within no n ation's Exclusive Economic Zone; they pass through currents of water and air from nation to nation, and throug h complex food chains from species to species, distri buting the burdens of development, if not the benef its, to both rich and poor. 7. Only the high seas outside of national jurisdict ion are truly 'commons'; but fish species, pollutio n, and other effects of economic development do not respect thes e legal boundaries. Sound management of the ocean commons will require management of land-based activ ities as well. Five zones bear on this management: inland areas, which affect the oceans mostly via ri vers; coastal lands - swamps, marshes, and so on - close to the sea, where human activities can directly affect the adjacent waters; coastal waters - estuaries, l agoons, and shallow waters generally - where the effects of lan d-based activities are dominant; offshore waters, o ut roughly to the edge of the continental shelf; and the high seas, largely beyond the 200-mile EEZs of coastal s tates' control. 8. Major fisheries are found mostly in offshore wat ers, while pollution affecting them comes mostly fr om inland sources and is concentrated in coastal waters. Form al international management is essential in the are as United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. beyond the EEZs, although greater international coo peration, including improved frameworks to coordina te national action, is needed for all areas. 1. The Balance Under Threat 9. Today, the living resources of the sea are under threat from overexploitation, pollution, and land- based development. Most major familiar fish stocks throug hout the waters over the continental shelves, which provide 95 per cent of the world's fish catch, are now thre atened by overfishing. 10. Other threats are more concentrated. The effect s of pollution and land development are most severe in coastal waters and semi-enclosed seas along the wor ld's shore-lines. The use of coastal areas for sett lement, industry, energy facilities, and recreation will ac celerate, as will the upstream manipulation of estu arine river systems through dams or diversion for agriculture a nd municipal water supplies. These pressures have destroyed estuarine habitats as irrevocably as dire ct dredging, filling, or paving. Shore-lines and th eir resources will suffer ever increasing damage if current, busi ness-as-usual approaches to policy, management, and institutions continue. The world's environmental problems are greater than the sum of those in each country. Certainly, they can no longer be dealt with purely on a nation-state basis . The World Commission on Environment and Developme nt must strike at this fundamental problem by recommen ding specific ways for countries to cooperate to su rmount sovereignty, to embrace international instruments i n order to deal with global threats. The growing tr end towards isolationism demonstrates that the current rhythm of history is out of harmony with human aspi rations, even with its chances for survival. The challenge ahead is for us to transcend the self -interests of our respective nation-states so as to embrace a broader self-interest -- the survival of the human species in a threatened world. Hon. Tom McMillan Minister of Environment, Government of Canada WCED Public Hearing Ottawa, 26-27 May 1986 11. Certain coastal and offshore waters are especia lly vulnerable to ecologically insensitive onshore development, to competitive overfishing, and to pol lution. The trends are of special concern in coasta l areas where pollution by domestic sewage, industrial wast es, and pesticide and fertilizer run-off may threat en not only human health but also the development of fisheries. 12. Even the high seas are beginning to show some s igns of stress from the billions of tons of contami nants added each year. Sediments brought to the oceans by great rivers such as the Amazon can be traced for as much as 2,000 kilometres out to sea. /2 Heavy metals from coal-burning plants and some ind ustrial processes also reach the oceans via the atmosphere. The amoun t of oil spilled annually from tankers now approach es 1.5 million tons. /3 The marine environment, exposed to nuclear radiati on from past nuclear weapons tests, is receiving more exposure from the continuing disposa l of low-level radioactive wastes. 13. New evidence of a possible rapid depletion of t he ozone layer and a consequent increase in ultravi olet radiation poses a threat not only to human health b ut to ocean life. Some scientists believe that this radiation could kill sensitive phytoplankton and fish larvae floating near the ocean's surface, damaging ocean f ood chains and possibly disrupting planetary support sy stems. /4 14. High concentrations of substances such as heavy metals, organochlorines, and petroleum have been f ound on the oceans' surface. With continued accumulation , these could have complex and long lasting effects . /5 The sea-floor is a region of complex physical, chemical , and biological activity where microbial processes play a major role, but as yet serious damage is known to h ave occurred only in very localized regions. Althou gh these findings are encouraging, given accelerating pressu res and the inadequacy of present data, they provid e no grounds for complacency.

Oceans Management 15. Looking to the next century, the Commission is convinced that sustainable development, if not surv ival itself, depends on significant advances in the mana gement of the oceans. Considerable changes will be required in our institutions and policies and more resources will have to be committed to oceans manag ement. 16. Three imperatives lie at the heart of the ocean s management question: The underlying unity of the oceans requires effect ive global management regimes. The shared resource characteristics of many region al seas make forms of regional management mandatory. The major land-based threats to the oceans require effective national actions based on international cooperation. 17. Mutual dependence has increased in recent years . The Law of the Sea Convention , with the establishment of the 200-mile EEZs, has put an additional 35 per cent of the oceans surface under national control w ith regard to management of natural resources. It has a lso provided an institutional setting that could le ad to better management of these areas, given that single govern ments may be expected to manage more rationally resources over which they have sole control. Howeve r, this expectation ignores the realities of short sighted political and economic goals. 18. An international ecosystem approach is required for the management of these resources for sustaine d use. Significant gains have been made in past decades, n ationally and internationally, and many essential components have been put in place. But they do not add up to a system that reflects the imperatives me ntioned above. Where the EEZs of several states come togeth er in semi-enclosed or regional seas, integrated management requires varying degrees of internationa l cooperation, such as joint monitoring and researc h on migratory species and measures to combat pollution and regulate actions whose effects reach across boundaries. 19. When it comes to the high seas beyond national jurisdiction, international action is essential. Th e sum of the multiple conventions and programmes now in plac e do not and cannot represent such a regime. Even t he separate UN programmes cannot easily be coordinated , given the structure of the United Nations. /6 20. The Commission believes that a number of action s are urgently needed to improve regimes for oceans management. Thus the Commission proposes measures t o: strengthen capacity for national action, especiall y in developing countries; improve fisheries management; reinforce cooperation in semi-enclosed and regiona l seas; strengthen control of ocean disposal of hazardous and nuclear wastes; and advance the Law of the Sea . 2.1 National Action 21. Coastal governments should launch an urgent rev iew of the legal and institutional requirements for integrated management of their EEZs, and of their r oles in arrangements for international cooperation. This review should be undertaken within the framework of a clear statement of national goals and priorities . Reducing overexploitation of fisheries in coastal a nd offshore waters might be one such goal. The rapi d clean- up of municipal and industrial pollution dischargin g into critical marine habitats could be another. O thers might include strengthening national research and managem ent capacity, and producing an inventory of coastal and marine resources. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 22. Given the increased pressures on coastal and ma rine resources projected through the year 2000, all coastal states should have a complete inventory of these assets. Drawing on senior experts from nation al and international agencies, nations could deploy the la test satellite mapping and other techniques to put together an inventory of these resources and then monitor chang es in them. 23. Many developing countries will require assistan ce to strengthen their legal and institutional fram eworks needed for integrated management of coastal resourc es. Many small island and maritime developing count ries lack the economic or military means to prevent the exploitation of their coastal resources or the poll ution of their waters by powerful countries or companies. This has become a major concern in the Pacific in particula r, and threatens the political stability of the region. In ternational development banks and development assis tance agencies should establish programmes to support the development of this Institutional capacity. 2.2 Fisheries Management 24. World fisheries have been expanding since the S econd World War, with the global catch rising at a steady 6-7 per cent annually from 20 million to 65 million tons between 1950 and 1969. But after 1970, as mor e and more stocks were depleted, the average annual growt h in catches fell to only about 1 per cent. (See Ta ble 10- 1.) With conventional management practices, the gro wth era in fisheries is over. Even assuming restore d productivity in now depleted stocks, and an increas ed harvest from underutilized fisheries, FAO sees o nly a gradual increase in catches, perhaps rising from cu rrent levels of over 80 million tons to about 100 m illion. This does not augur well for future food security, espec ially in low-income countries where fish are a prin cipal source of animal protein and where millions secure their l ivelihoods from fisheries activities. /7 25. Overexploitation threatens many stocks as econo mic resources. Several of the world's largest fishe ries - the Peruvian anchoveta, several North Atlantic herr ing stocks, and the Californian sardine - have coll apsed following periods of heavy fishing. In some of the areas affected by these collapses, and in other ric h fisheries such as the Gulf of Thailand and off West Africa, h eavy fishing has been followed by marked changes in species composition. /8 The reasons for these changes are not well underst ood, and more research is needed into the responses of marine resources to exploitat ion so that managers can receive better scientific advice. Greater support for such work is urgently needed, a nd this support must include additional assistance to developing countries in increasing their research c apacity and their knowledge of their own resources. 26. One factor leading to the establishment of exte nded EEZs was the concern of coastal states, both industrialized and developing, over the depletion o f fisheries off their coasts. A large number of con ventions had been established covering most major fisheries, but they proved inadequate in most cases. Particip ating countries were in general unable to overcome the di fficulties of allocating shares to limited common r esources. Improved management was seen as an urgent need, and open access was perceived as the main obstacle to it. 27. The advent of extended EEZs under the Law of th e Sea Convention was expected to solve or at least alleviate the problem. Coastal states were required to introduce effective conservation and management of the living resources in their EEZs. They could also con trol the activities of foreign fishermen and develo p their own fisheries. 28. Industrial countries have been much more succes sful in doing this than developing countries. In th e north- west Atlantic, the annual catch by long-range fleet s has declined from over 2 million tons before 1974 to around a quarter of a million tons in 1983, and the share of the catch taken by the United States and Canada has risen from under 50 per cent to over 90 per cent. Table 10-1 World Fish Catch in Major Fisheries, 1979-84 1979 1980 1981 1982 1983 1984 Region (thousand tons) North Atlantic 14,667 Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology.

Source: Based on data in FAO, Yearbooks of Fishery Statistics (Rome: 1979-84). 29. Yet long-range industrial fishing fleets still catch about 5 million tons annually in developing r egions. Off West Africa, for example, over half the total catch is still taken by such fleets. /9 This is due partly to the fact that many of the biggest resources lie off thinly popula ted areas - the western edge of the Sahara and off Namibia. But it is also due to the common lack of locally av ailable capital, and to a shortage of local experti se in many technical aspects of fisheries, especially processi ng and marketing. 30. Coastal developing countries can usually obtain some modest revenue in the form of licence fees, b ut this represents only a fraction of what they could earn from a full national use of the resource. Another 1 0-15 million tons of so far underutilized or unexploited resourc es could be added to the existing fisheries off the ir coasts. /10 There is a pressing need for these resources to be managed sustainably, for the benefit of developing countries and in ways that help to meet global nutritional ne eds. The opinion of the public is what you see here in t his room. You see important leaders from all over B razil, from all over the country that have come here, from the rubberman that was under a palmtree yesterday and w as here speaking to the U.N. Commission and leaders th at are independent. The Brazilian population yearne d to have someone to speak to. Someone who will listen, who will not sort of mystify things, and someone wh o will not trick them. So there is an enormous expectation with regards to the seriousness of your Commission . Randau Marques Journalist WCED Public Hearing Sao Paulo, 28-29 Oct 1985 31. Whaling offers another example. Recognizing tha t the history of whaling up to the 1960s was that o f overexploitation, the International Whaling Commiss ion (IWC), the main international body regulating w haling, has taken a series of conservation measures since t he early 1970s and now all stocks that are below a certain level have been classified as protected from commer cial whaling. 32. In its early days, the IWC was dominated by wha ling nations. After 1979, non-whaling nations becam e an increasingly significant majority of the membership . This change was reflected in the IWC's decisions, which increasingly opted in cases of scientific doubt for a cautious approach and the reduction of catch lev els or the cessation of whaling altogether on certain stocks. 33. This trend culminated in the moratorium decisio n of 1982. Members have the right to object and con tinue commercial whaling or to catch whales for scientifi c purposes. There is a strongly held view in conser vation circles that whaling for scientific purposes can be used as a loophole by whaling nations. Permissions for such hunting should be stringently applied by IWC member s, or the IWC's credibility will be undermined. 34. An important political factor in recent develop ments hat been the ability of the U.S. Government t o invoke legislation that enables contracts for fishing in U .S. waters to be withheld from nations that undermi ne marine United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. conservation agreements. The value of such fishery concessions is large and the legislation has signif icant political and economic leverage. Another important factor has been the strength of the NGOs in organiz ing support for anti-whaling actions, lobbying governme nts and organizing boycotts of fish and other produ cts from whaling nations. 35. By early 1987, whaling was restricted to scient ific catches by Iceland and the Republic of Korea a nd to a small catch by Norway, which continued to object to the moratorium, but which planned to halt its comm ercial whaling following the 1967 season. And there were c atches by Japan and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Un ion had indicated it would observe the moratorium after the 1987 Antarctic season, and Japan had withdrawn its objection to the moratorium with effect from 1988. However, Japan may continue whaling for scientific purposes. /11 In addition, some whaling was being performed by n ative peoples in the Soviet Union and Alaska. 36. If the moratorium is observed and whaling for s cientific purposes is not abused, commercial whalin g will no longer be a major threat to the conservation of wha le stocks taken as a whole. The annual rate of incr ease of these stocks, however, is unlikely to exceed a few per cent. Thus substantial whale populations will p robably not be observed much before the second half of the next century. 2.3 Cooperation on Regional Seas 37. A large number of agreements have been entered into on regional seas. The Commission has not attempted to evaluate them all, but given the Commi ssion's origin in the UNEP Governing Council and th e General Assembly resolution, it has given special a ttention to UNEP's Regional Seas Programme. This programme now brings together over 130 states borde ring 11 different shared seas around the world, sta tes that have an interest in cooperating for their own and mutual benefit. 38. UNEP provides the initial impetus by bringing g overnments together to develop a flexible legal fra mework within which further agreements can be negotiated a s needs require and politics allow. UNEP also provi des some initial seed money for programme development, but the governments of the region themselves are me ant to take over funding and management, drawing on the technical advice of UN and other agencies. The res ult is a gradually evolving action-oriented programme root ed in the needs of the regions as perceived by the governments concerned. Fourteen UN agencies and ove r 40 international and regional organizations participate in the worldwide programme. 39. The political strategy behind the programme' an d the requirement that management and financing be undertaken by the participating countries have clea rly been crucial to its success. But it is one thin g to contribute a few million dollars for research, and quite another to incorporate the resulting findings into land- based development plans and to enforce strong pollu tion control programmes. The massive U.S.-Canadian clean up of the Great Lakes over the past 15 years cost $8.85 billion for partial treatment of municip al and industrial wastes. /12 Huge investments will also be required to roll bac k land-based pollution along UNEP's regional seas. Yet nowhere have the sums been commi tted under agreed schedules to construct the necess ary urban and industrial pollution control systems and to underwrite policies to control agricultural run- off. The programme now has to confront the regional seas cha llenge through the year 2000 - moving beyond genera l agreement on goals and research to a solid schedule of investment on a scale that will make a differen ce. 2.4 Measures to Control Ocean Disposal of Waste 40. The Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter (London Dumping Convention), which has world-wide applicati on, was concluded in November 1972 and entered into force on 30 August 1975. /13 Its political evolution parallels that of the Inte rnational Whaling Commission. Initially, it consisted largely of dumping states, but non-dumping states are now in the majority. At present it has 61 contracting parties, and secretariat facilities are provided by the International Maritime Organiza tion. The dumping of wastes is regulated by the three annexes to the Convention: /14 on extremely dangerous substances including high-level radioactive wastes, the dumping of which is prohibited, ( Annex I ); on somewhat less noxious substances, the dumping or which can b e permitted only by 'prior special permit' ( Annex II ); and all other substances, which can be dumped only after a general permit has been obtained from national auth orities (Annex III ). Although the Convention applies to all wastes du mped deliberately at sea, the ocean disposal of radioactive wastes has attracted the most attention . It is this question that the Commission considers here. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 41. Prior to 1963, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Belgium, and the Netherlands had been dumping low- level wastes regularly at the north-east Atlantic dumpsit e in international waters off the coast of Spain. D espite protests from representatives of these nations at t he London Dumping Convention meeting that they woul d ignore a moratorium resolution on low-level wastes and carry out dumping during 1983, a de facto morat orium - which all countries honour but to which some have n ot formally agreed - went into and remains in effec t. Under it, no disposal should take place until it can be d emonstrated that it is environmentally safe. 42. In 1985, the London Dumping Convention voted to extend indefinitely the moratorium on the ocean dumping of low-level radioactive wastes. /15 As a result, the burden of proof that such activit ies are safe was effectively reversed, being put on those nations wh o want to dump. This revolutionary reversal, though not binding, reflects the changed composition of the Lo ndon Dumping Convention. 43. In 1986, the London Dumping Convention establis hed an intergovernmental panel of experts to examin e the issue of comparative risks of land- and sea-bas ed options for disposal of radioactive waste. Witho ut prejudging this assessment, the Commission would ur ge all states to continue to refrain from disposing of either low or high- level wastes at sea or in the sea-bed. Moreover, it would seem prudent to anticipate cont inuing opposition to sea dumping and to actively pursue th e siting and development of environmentally safe, l and based methods of disposal. Why must we gamble with the lives of innocent child ren in order to generate plutonium for bombs? Even to contemplate dumping radioactive waste in waters tha t belong to all of us as part of our global heritag e is an outrage. For us to make such important decisions on behalf of future generations without taking into a ccount the morality of using international waters as an ex clusive rubbish bin is an arrogant act. Peter Wilkinson Greenpeace WCED Public Hearing Oslo, 24-25 June 1985 44. Several other conventions regulate the dumping of wastes in the north-east Atlantic and North Sea, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Baltic Sea. Most of the Regional Seas Conventions also include a general provision calling on contracting parties to take al l appropriate measures to prevent and reduce pollut ion caused by dumping. 45. Land-based sources of nuclear waste have become significant in the North Sea, where high levels of radioactivity have been found in fish, and could th reaten other seas. /16 The Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Land Based Sources (Paris Convention) was ratified in 1978 by eight s tates and the European Economic Community. While it has achieved some international cooperation, its silence on nucl ear plants and its acceptance of the 'best available te chnology' principle in determining permitted levels of radioactive discharges clearly needs to be reviewed . 46. The Law of the Sea Convention requires states to establish national laws and reg ulations to 'prevent, reduce and control pollution of the marine environm ent from dumping'. It also requires express prior a pproval by the coastal state for dumping in the territorial sea, in the EEZs, and onto the continental shelf. The legislative history of this Article indicates that coastal stat es have not only the right to act but a duty to do so. States also have an obligation under the Law of the Sea to ensu re that their activities do not injure the health a nd environment of neighbouring states and the commons. 47. The Commission encourages the London Dumping Convention to reaffirm the rights and responsibilities of states to control and regulate dumping within the 2 00-mile EEZ. It is urgent that they do so, as ocean s and food chains respect no boundaries. 48. Moreover, all states should undertake to report releases of toxic and radioactive substances from land- based sources into any body of water to the appropr iate Convention Secretariat so that they may begin to report on the aggregate releases into various seas. Competent authorities must be designated to keep r ecords of the nature and quantities of wastes dumped. Beyo nd that, regional institutions should forward this information to the London Dumping Convention Secret ariat.

The United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea was the most ambitious attempt ever to provide an internationally agreed regime for the management of the oceans. The resulting Convention represents a major step towards an integrated management regime for th e oceans. It has already encouraged national and international action to manage the oceans. /17 50. The Convention reconciled widely divergent inte rests of states, and established the basis for a ne w equity in the use of the oceans and their resources. It co nfirmed that coastal states are empowered to exerci se sovereignty over their territorial sea, sea- bed an d subsoil, and the superjacent air space, up to a d istance of 12 nautical miles. It redefined the rights of coastal states concerning the continental shelf. It establi shed Exclusive Economic Zones of up to 200 nautical miles within w hich the coastal state may exercise sovereign right s with regard to the management of national resources, liv ing and non-living, in the waters, sea bed, and sub soil. 51. The Convention removed 35 per cent of the ocean s as a source of growing conflict between states. I t stipulates that coastal states must ensure that the living resources of the EEZs are not endangered by overexploitation. Thus, governments now have not on ly the legal power and the self-interest to apply s ound principles of resource management within this area, but they have an obligation to do so. The Conventi on calls for regional cooperation in formulating and impleme nting conservation and management strategies for li ving marine resources, including cooperation in the exch ange of scientific information, the conservation an d development of stocks, and the optimum use of highl y migratory species. 52. Similarly, coastal states now have a clear inte rest in the sound management of the continental she lf and in the prevention of pollution from land- and sea-base d activities. Under the Convention, coastal states may adopt laws and regulations for their EEZs compatible with international rules and standards to combat pollut ion from vessels. 53. The Convention also defines the waters, sea bed , and subsoil beyond the limits of national jurisdi ction, and recognizes this as international. Over 45 per cent of the planet's surface, this sea-bed area and its resources are declared to be the 'common heritage of mankind' , a concept that represents a milestone in the real m of international cooperation. The Convention would bri ng all mining activities in the sea-bed under the c ontrol of an International Seabed Authority. 54. By early 1987, the Convention had been signed b y 159 nations, and 32 countries had ratified it. Ho wever, a small number of significant states had indicated th at they were unlikely to ratify it. /18 The reasons for this rest largely with the regime proposed to manage the comm on sea bed. 55. Despite this, many of the Convention's other pr ovisions have been broadly accepted and have alread y entered into international law and practice in vari ous ways. This process should be encouraged, especi ally as regards those provisions that relate to the environ ment. This Commission believes that the Convention should be ratified by the major technological powers and c ome into force. Indeed, the most significant initia l action that nations can take in the interests of the oceans' th reatened life-support system is to ratify the Law o f the Sea Convention. II. Space: A Key to Planetary Management 56. Outer space can play a vital role in ensuring t he continued habitability of the Earth, largely thr ough space technology to monitor the vital signs of the planet and aid humans in protecting its health. According to the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use of occupation, or by any other means. The UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space has b een labouring to see that these ideals remain on th e agenda. This Commission, in view of these developme nts, considers space as a global commons and part o f the common heritage of mankind. 57. The future of the space as a resource will depe nd not so much on technology as on the slow and dif ficult struggle to create sound international institutions to manage this resource. It will depend most of al l upon humanity's ability to prevent an arms race in space . United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 1. Remote Sensing from Space 58. If humanity is going to respond effectively to the consequences of changes human activity has indu ced - the build-up of atmospheric carbon dioxide, depletion o f stratospheric ozone, acid precipitation, and trop ical forest destruction - better data on the Earth's natural sy stems will be essential. 59. Today several dozen satellites contribute to th e accumulation of new knowledge about the Earth's s ystems: for example, about the spread of volcanic gases, en abling scientists for the first time to describe th e specific links between a major natural disturbance of the up per atmosphere and changes in the weather thousands of miles away. /19 60. Satellites also played a key scientific role af ter the 1986 discovery of a 'hole' in the ozone lay er over Antarctica. When ground-based observers noted this phenomenon, archived satellite data were examined a nd provided a record of seasonal ozone fluctuation ext ending back nearly a decade. /20 And scientists have been able to follow closely the unfolding of the drought in the Sahel region of Africa in the 1980s. Satell ite-generated maps correlating rainfall patterns and biomass have served as a tool in understanding droughts and hel ped in the targeting of relief aid. We need a kind of new earth/space monitoring system . I think that it goes farther than simply an earth environmental system. It's a combined earth/space m onitoring system, a new agency that would have the resources to be able to monitor, report, and recomm end in a very systematic way on the earth/space int eraction that is so fundamental to a total ecological view o f the biosphere. Maxwell Cohen University of Ottawa WCED Public Hearing Ottawa, 26-27 May 1986 61. Recently, an international and interdisciplinar y group of scientists has proposed a major new init iative - the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) to be coordinated through ICSU. It would investigat e the biosphere using many technologies, including sa tellites. This proposal seemed in 1987 to be gainin g momentum; it was already influencing the budget dec isions of several nations on allocations for future satellite launches and is increasing coordination between exi sting efforts. 62. The primary frustration about this wealth of da ta is that the information is dispersed among gover nments arid institutions, rather than being pooled. UNEP's Global Environment Monitoring System is a modest e ffort to pool space data relevant to the Earth's habitabilit y. It should be strengthened. But most such efforts are underfunded, undercoordinated, and inadequate to th e tasks. 63. The primary responsibility for action rests ini tially with national governments, cooperating to po ol, store and exchange data. In time, international efforts might be funded through some direct global revenue sourc e or through contributions from individual nations. (See Chapter 12 .) 2. The Geosynchronous Orbit 64. From an economic point of view, the most valuab le part of the Earth's orbital space is the geosync hronous orbit, a band of space 36,000 kilometres, above the equator. /21 Most communication and many weather satellites - as well as many military orbits - are in geosynchronous orbit. To prevent signals to and from the satellites interfering with one another, satellites must be placed some distance apart, effectively li miting the number that can use this valuable band to 180. Thus , the geosynchronous orbit is not only a valuable b ut also a scarce and limited global resource. 65. The growth in satellite communication traffic d uring the 1970s led to many predictions that slots would soon be saturated. Thus conflict emerged over the use an d ownership of the geosynchronous orbit, largely be tween industrial nations that have the capacity to put sa tellites in this orbit and the equatorial developin g nations that do not but that lie beneath this band of space. 66. The first effort to devise a property regime fo r geosynchronous orbit was the 1976 Bogota Declarat ion, signed by seven equatorial countries. /22 These countries declared that the orbits above the m were extensions United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. of their territorial airspace. The Bogota Declarati on has been challenged by some nations that see it as contradicting the 'non-appropriation' principle of the Outer Space Treaty . Another group of developing countries proposed a licensing system for the use of geosynch ronous orbits. /23 Countries would be awarded slots that could then be sold, rented, or reserved for future use. 67. Another way of managing this resource and captu ring its rental value for the common interest would be for an international body to own and license the slots to bidders at an auction. Such an alternative would be analogous to the Seabed Authority in the Law of the Sea Convention . 66. Industrial countries have opposed the creation of a property rights regime for geosynchronous orbi t, especially a regime that granted rights to slots to countries that cannot now use them. They argue tha t a regime of prior allocation would drive up costs and reduce the incentive of the private sector to develop and use this orbit. Others, who see a rapidly growing role for s atellite communications, argue that regulatory regi mes should be established before competition makes such a step more difficult. 69. Since satellite communications involve the use of radio waves, a de facto regime for the parcellin g out of slots in geosynchronous orbit has emerged through t he activities of the International Telecommunicatio ns Union (ITU) in the past several years. The ITU allo cates the use of the radio waves (those parts of th e electromagnetic spectrum used for communication). /24 The highly technical character of the task of parc elling out radio waves, combined with the fact that strict compliance is necessary to allow any user to enjoy access to this resource, has produced a successful internatio nal resource regime, based on three regional confer ences, for effective management of the resource. /25 Whether this approach will endure depends in large part upon the perceived justice of the decisions reached by the r egional conferences. 3. The Pollution of Orbital Space 70. Debris in orbit is a growing threat to human ac tivities in space. In 1981, a panel of experts conv ened by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics concluded that the growth of space debris could pos e 'an unacceptable threat' to life in space within a deca de. /26 This debris consists of spent fuel tanks, rocket s hells, satellites that no longer function, and shrapnel fr om explosions in space: it is concentrated in the r egion between 160 and 1,760 kilometres above the Earth. 71. With greater care in the design and disposal of satellites, much of it could be avoided. However, the creation of debris is an integral and unavoidable c onsequence of the testing and use of space weapons. The contribution of military activities to the Earth's 'debris belt' could grow greatly if plans to place large numbers of satellite based weapons and weapons-related sensors are realized. 72. The most important measure to minimize space de bris, therefore, is to prevent the further testing and deployment of space based weapons or weapons design ed tor use against objects in space. 73. Clean up would be expensive. It has been propos ed that the major powers lead an international effo rt to retrieve the larger pieces of space debris from orb it. Such work would involve the design, constructio n, and launch of vehicles that could manoeuvre in space an d grapple with large, jagged, tumbling space object s. The proposal has elicited little enthusiasm. 4. Nuclear Power in Orbit 74. Many spacecraft are nuclear-powered and threate n contamination if they fall to the Earth. /27 There are two basic approaches to the problem: Ban or regulate. T he option of banning all radioactive materials from space is the simplest to enact. It would eliminate the probl em and would also severely stunt the further develo pment of space-based warfare systems. A total ban should exe mpt scientific uses in deep-space, as small amounts of fissionable materials have been essential for the p owering of deep-space probes. A ban on reactors in space would be easy to monitor, because reactors produce waste heat detectable by infrared sensors at great distances. Verifying the absence of small nuclear p ower systems would be more difficult, but still pos sible. 75. A wide variety of methods are available for reg ulating the use of radioactive materials in space. The most important include limiting the size of reactors per mitted in orbit, requiring shielding around radioac tive material sufficient to withstand reentry into the Earth's at mosphere, and requiring deep space disposal of spac ecraft that United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. contain radioactive material. All are technological ly feasible, but would add cost and complexity to m issions. Nevertheless, these measures should be implemented, as a minimum step. 5. Towards a Space Regime 76. Soon after the aeroplane was invented, it becam e obvious that collisions would occur unless a gene ral air traffic control regime was established. This model offers a useful way to think about the need for and contents of a space regime. The creation of 'rules of the ro ad' for orbital space could ensure that the activit ies of some do not degrade the resource for all. Utilization of spacecraft for solving the problems of forestry provides a good example of the peaceful use of space. Taking into account the interests of the pre sent and future generations, there is no other more favourable area of space technology application tha n environmental protection, to study the natural re sources of Earth and control their rational utilization and reproduction. We think that in the forthcoming yea rs international cooperation in this field will be fur ther expanded. L. E. Mikhailov USSR State Committee on Forestry WCED Public Hearing Moscow, 11 Dec 1986 77. Orbital space cannot be effectively managed by any one country acting alone. The inherently intern ational character of orbital space has been recognized by a majority of nations in the Outer Space Treaty . The international community should seek to design and i mplement a space regime to ensure that space remain s a peaceful environment for the benefit of all. 78. An essential step towards efficient management of the space resource is to abandon the notion that because outer space in general is unlimited, orbita l space can absorb all human activity. Because of t he speeds involved, orbital space is for practical pur poses much 'closer' than the atmosphere. A system o f space traffic control in which some activities were forbi dden and others harmonized cuts a middle path betwe en the extremes of a sole Space Authority and the present near anarchy. 79. The electromagnetic spectrum has been effective ly regulated by international agreement, and throug h this regulation has begun to emerge the beginnings of a space regime for geosynchronous orbital space. An extension of this type of approach to control debri s and the use of nuclear materials in orbit is the next logical step. 80. A fine balance must be struck between regulatin g activities too late and regulating non-existent a ctivities too soon. Regulating activities on the Moon, for exampl e, beyond the general principles laid out in the Outer Space Treaty is clearly premature. But regulating space debris and nuclear materials in Earth orbit is clearly ove rdue. III. Antarctica: Towards Global Cooperation 81. The Antarctic continent - larger than the Unite d states and Mexico combined - for over a generatio n has been managed under a regime of multilateral coopera tion that has secured environmental protection. Sig ned on 1 December 1959, the Antarctic Treaty has been the vehicle for a number of important ini tiatives in pursuit of its two primary objectives: to maintain Antarcti ca for peaceful uses only, prohibiting all military activities, weapons testing, nuclear explosions, and disposal o f radioactive wastes; and to promote freedom of sci entific investigation in Antarctica and international coope ration to that end. /28 82. The fact that the 'question of Antarctica' is t oday on the UN agenda /29 indicates the reality that there is a debate in the international community over the futu re management of the continent. Under the combined pressures of economic, technological, environmental , and other trends, there are new initiatives to es tablish a regime for minerals exploitation. New questions abo ut equitable management are presenting challenges t hat may reshape the political context of the continent within the next decade. /30 83. During the forthcoming period of change, the ch allenge is to ensure that Antarctica is managed in the interests of all humankind, in a manner that conser ves its unique environment, preserves its value for scientific research, and retains its character as a demilitari zed, non-nuclear zone of peace. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 84. Responsibility for guiding change at present re sts initially with the countries party to the Antar ctic Treaty. /31 Eighteen nations now enjoy full decision-making sta tus under the Treaty, with these consultative parti es exercising their rights and carrying out their obli gations in peaceful cooperation despite their diver gent views on the territorial claims to parts of the continent. A n additional 17 nations have observer status at the biennial Antarctic Treaty System (ATS) meetings. 85. The Antarctic Treaty is open to accession by any state that is a member of the United Nations, and by others invited to accede. To become a Consultative Party, a state must demonstrate concrete interest i n Antarctica by conducting substantial scientific res earch there. The Treaty nations feel that this syst em is applied flexibly and opens the Treaty to all nations with a genuine interest in Antarctica. Many developing na tions without the resources to conduct research on the co ntinent feel that this condition effectively exclud es most of the world's nations. /32 86. But the question of participation is not polari zed between industrial and developing countries. No t all industrialized countries are members of the Treaty, and Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, India, and Ur uguay have consultative status under it, while several ad ditional developing countries have acceded to it. H owever, the overwhelming majority of developing countries, including all those of Africa, remain outside the arrangements. 87. There is furthermore no general agreement as to whether Antarctica is part of the international co mmons. For example, seven states maintain territorial clai ms. Moreover, many developing countries reject the idea that what they regard as the common heritage of mankind should be managed by some countries to the exclusio n of others. Many of them see the Antarctic Treaty Sy stem as the exclusive preserve of the rich and technologically advanced countries. Some object to what they consider the exclusivity of the Treaty sy stem, with countries self-appointed to determine the futu re of the continent. Although the Consultative Part ies assert that they have managed Antarctica in the interests of all peoples, several nations maintain that these interests should not be defined by the Consultative Parties a lone; this view has gained many new sources of expr ession since 1959. Despite the present debate over the con tinent's future, many nations outside the Treaty ha ve recognized the trusteeship role played by the Treat y nations in protecting the environment of Antarcti ca. /33 88. The Commission does not propose to adjudicate t he status of Antarctica. But it sees it as essentia l that the continent be managed and protected in a responsible manner that takes into account the common interest s at stake, it notes also that the legal and management regimes are in the midst of a process of change lea ding to wider participation. 89. The Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties have endeavoured to demonstrate a strong concern for the protection of the continent's environment and the c onservation of its natural resources. (See Box 10-1 .) In 1964, they adopted the ' Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic F auna and Flora ', /34 which amount to a conservation protocol to the Treaty. At subseq uent biennial meetings, they have continued to deve lop environmental principles and measures to guide the planning and execution of their activities. Additio nal measures would improve the scope and effectiveness of environmental protection, and it would be useful to consider means to ensure that the record of complia nce with these measures is widely known. 90. The Consultative Parties have also played a lea ding role in the promulgation of two important inte rnational conventions relating to conservation of living reso urces: the 1972 Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Seals and the 1980 Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources ./35 The second arose out of concern that the depletion of Antarcti c fish stocks, particularly shrimp like krill, coul d have severe and unpredictable effects on related and dependent species. It adopts an 'ecosystem approach' to resou rce management. /36 91. Taken together, these legal instruments and acc ompanying protocols and recommendations, along with the non governmental body the Scientific Committee on A ntarctic Research (SCAR), constitute what is referr ed to as the Antarctic Treaty System. This system demonst rates the evolution that has taken place under the Antarctic Treaty since it entered into force. 92. Several international NGOs have begun to monito r the adequacy of and compliance with environmental protection and conservation measures in Antarctica and have frequently been critical of these measures . They have also sought observer status at ATS meetings an d greater involvement in the formulation and review of United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. Antarctic policies. Some UK agencies are concerned with southern hemisphere meteorology, oceanography, or fishing and have become involved in Antarctic scien ce and politics. A concrete result of this interest has been invitations extended to WMO, FAO, IOC, IUCN, IWC, S CAR, and the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research to attend as observers meetings of the Com mission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Li ving Resources (CCAMLR). The European Economic Community is also a CCAMLR member as a result of its member states ceding competence to it with respect to fisheries management policies. Box 10-1 Antarctica's Unique Treaty Arrangements Under the Antarctic Treaty , the seven states claiming territory there have ag reed with non-claimant parties to the Treaty to Bet aside the disputed territorial st atus of Antarctica in order to carry out agreed-upo n activities in the area. While the Treaty is in force, no acts or activities taking place will 'constitute a basis for assertin g, supporting or denying a claim to territorial sovereignty in Antar ctica', nor may any new claim, or enlargement of an existing claim, be asserted. Decisions are taken by consensus, which guarantees to both claimant and non-claimant states that no ac tivity or management practice prejudicial to their positio n on the territorial status of Antarctica will be a pproved. The Treaty provides for on-site inspection at any time in any or all areas of Antarctica by designated nat ionals of the consultative parties. Source: Based on Lee Kimball, 'Testing the Great Ex periment' Environment, September 1985. 93. For the ATS to remain viable into the next cent ury, it will need to continue to evolve and adapt i tself to deal with new issues and new circumstances. Although the Treaty could run indefinitely, in 1991 any of the Consultative Parties may call for a general confere nce of the signatory nations, to review its operati on. 1. Guard Present Achievements 94. Although further change in the management statu s of Antarctica is inevitable, it is essential that such change not jeopardize the achievements of the Treat y System in the areas of peace, science, conservati on, and environment. Antarctica has been an agreed zone of peace for nearly 30 years, free of all military activities, nuclear tests, and radioactive wastes. This is a fo undation on which humanity must build. 95. Cooperation in scientific investigation has ste adily expanded; it must be further strengthened, es pecially concerning Antarctica's role in global atmospheric and oceanic circulation and world climate. At the s ame time, more efforts should be made to secure full particip ation in such research. Means must be found to expa nd consultation and participation and to extend the be nefits of international cooperation in Antarctic sc ience and technology to the international community as a whol e. The most cruel environmental threat comes from the environmental movement itself as we see the animal rights laws systematically destroy our way of life and violate our right as aboriginal peoples to our traditions and values. Yet our people, including the Arctic people , need development. The challenge is to find strate gies for development that meet the needs of the people and t he environment. Rhoda Inuksu Inuit Indian WCED Public Hearing Ottawa, 26-27 May 1986 96. Several suggestions along these lines have been made. They include establishing a fund to facilita te the participation of interested developing countries in Antarctic science, and inviting more scientists fr om developing nations to join projects and visit scien tific stations. Given the costly technologies invol ved in Antarctic science, possibilities should be explored for sharing Antarctic base and logistics capabilit ies with interested non-consultative states. The right to co nsultative status could be extended to states parti cipating in scientific activities on a joint basis. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 97. As Antarctic activities multiply, sound conserv ation will also require increased data collection, monitoring, and environmental assessment. The interactive and c umulative effects of these projects must be careful ly reviewed and areas of unique scientific and environ mental value protected. 2. Anticipate Pressures for Mineral Development 98. Minerals of various kinds are known to exist in Antarctica, but the minerals talks have triggered false assumptions about the imminence of their developmen t. Even given the most optimistic growth trends, it seems clear that more accessible sources will be develope d elsewhere long before Antarctica attracts major investment. Only two minerals have been found that might exist in concentrations suitable for exploita tion - coal in the Transantarctic Mountains and iron in the Pri nce Charles Mountains. Mining them would be a fool' s venture. /37 The costs would be prohibitive, and sufficient coa l and iron can be found closer to the main markets. 99. Circumstantial evidence suggests the existence of offshore oil and gas, but no deposits have yet b een discovered. The USSR, Japan, France, the United Kin gdom, and the Federal Republic of Germany have surveyed Antarctica's continental shelves. The surv eys were of a scientific nature, but, coinciding as they did with the first serious discussions of a minerals re gime, were viewed by some observers as signalling commercial interests. 100. The 18 Consultative Parties are conducting neg otiations among themselves to complete an agreed le gal framework for determining the environmental accepta bility of possible minerals exploration and develop ment in Antarctica and to govern any such activities. /38 Treaty members felt that it would be more difficul t to agree on such a regime after actual finds have been made. Th e negotiations in many ways are an expression of th e idea that prevention is better than cure, forethought pr eferable to afterthought. 101. Antarctica is an enormous continent where clai ms to sovereignty are in dispute and where there ar e no agreed legal bases for issuing licences, leasing or selling mineral rights, or receiving royalty payme nts. These delicate questions have now been raised and will no t lie silent until they have been answered within a n internationally agreed framework. Until these matte rs are resolved, and protection of the Antarctic en vironment is assured, it seems unlikely that any nation or gr oup of nations will be able to invest securely in d eveloping the continent's mineral resources. /39 102. Given the absence of technologies tested in th e ultimate extremities of Antarctic conditions, the lack of agreement on procedures to assess and take account of the impacts of any development, and the sparse d ata base, it could take a generation or more of dedicat ed research and technological development to ensure that minerals exploitation would not destroy the Antarct ic's fragile ecosystem and its place in global envi ronmental processes. Thus it is important that no minerals ac tivity takes place until these conditions have chan ged, and then only in consonance with a regime that guarante es implementation of the most stringent standards n eeded to protect the continent's environment and share th e proceeds equitably. 3. Promote Evolution of Antarctic Treaty System 103. In the years ahead, activities in Antarctica w ill expand in kind and scale, as will the numbers o f participants in such activities. Further efforts must be made to ensure effective management of those activities an d an orderly expansion of participation in such manageme nt. A variety of options are being discussed by the international community. More effective management, including expanded participation, could evolve gra dually through the existing Treaty System. But given the e xtent of probable change and the lure of mineral we alth, however remote, such an approach could be too slow to retain political support. Another is that the ab ove goals might be reached through the negotiation of an enti rely new system. However, neither of these approach es would be free of difficulty. Yet another alternativ e would be to intensify efforts to make the Treaty System more universal, more open, and responsive to expressions of concrete and legitimate concern and interest in Antarctica. 4. Establish a Means for More Effective Communicati on 104. As activities under the different treaties inc rease, so does the importance of coordination among the advisory and decision making authorities responsibl e for various areas. Antarctica may require the United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. establishment of somewhat more formal institutions than have governed the first generation of activiti es, in order to foster better communication and coordinati on both within and outside the Treaty System. Some unique objects like Lake Baikal and Siberia, t he Great Lakes in Africa and North America, are par t of our global patrimony. They are some of the absolute val ues our planet possesses and their significance tra nscends any national boundaries. We should learn how to for esee their future and how to anticipate the after-e ffects of large-scale engineering projects. Since people's interests vary, it cannot be taken f or granted that people will accept scholars' recomm endations and come to agreement on that score. And their agre ement is of special importance in situations where global problems are involved and where the human race as a whole may be threatened with perils generated by t he absence of such agreement. What is needed today is the moulding of a new ethos and new arrangements for building an understanding among people, countries, and regions. And as a firs t step we should produce new knowledge, concentrate our research efforts on maintaining life on earth, and develop a system distributing and disseminating kno wledge and new moral criteria in a way that makes it avail able to billions of people who inhabit our planet. Academician N.N. Moiseev USSR Academy of Sciences WCED Public Hearing Moscow, 8 Dec 1986 105. Antarctica is on the agenda of the UN General Assembly and will probably remain so. Nothing will happen, however, unless the participants in the debate find terms of reference that can command broad-based su pport and an agreed upon means to explore and give effect to improved management. 106. To focus on longer-term strategies to preserve and build on the achievements of the existing Trea ty System, nations must create the means to foster dia logue among politicians, scientists, environmentali sts, and industries from countries within and outside it. A good place to start would be the development of clo ser working relationships between the parties to Antarc tic regimes and the international organizations wit hin and outside the UN system that have responsibilities fo r science and technology, conservation, and environ mental management. 107. National policy processes could also be struct ured to provide for dialogue with concerned industr ies, public interest organizations, and expert advisors, perhaps through an Antarctic advisory committee. T he U.S. Government has been in the forefront of those count ries appointing industry and public interest adviso rs to its delegations to Consultative Parties meetings. Austr alia, New Zealand, and Denmark have more recently followed suit. 108. Hammering out an internationally supported con sensus on Antarctica is a huge task requiting time and patience. And the lure of minerals increases with e very new rumour of a find. Yet such a consensus is the only way to prevent a tragic plundering of the silent co ntinent, and to maintain Antarctica as a symbol of peaceful international cooperation and environmental protect ion.

Among the dangers facing the environment, the po ssibility of nuclear war, or military conflict of a lesser scale involving weapons of mass destruction, is undoubted ly the gravest. Certain aspects of the issues of pe ace and security bear directly upon the concept of sustaina ble development. Indeed, they are central to it. 2. Environmental stress is both a cause and an effe ct of political tension and military conflict. /1 Nations have often fought to assert or resist control over raw m aterials, energy supplies, land, river basins, sea passages, and other key environmental resources. Such conflic ts are likely to increase as these resources become scarcer and competition for them increases. 3. The environmental consequences of armed conflict would be most devastating in the case of thermo-nu clear war. But there are damaging effects too from conven tional, biological, and chemical weapons, as well a s from the disruption of economic production and social or ganization in the wake of warfare and mass migratio n of refugees. But even where war is prevented, and wher e conflict is contained, a state of 'peace' might w ell entail the diversion into armament production of vast reso urces that could, at least in part, be used to prom ote sustainable forms of development. 4. A number of factors affect the connection betwee n environmental stress, poverty, and security, such as inadequate development policies, adverse trends in the international economy, inequities in multi-raci al and multi-ethnic societies, and pressures of population growth. These linkages among environment, developm ent, and conflict are complex and, in many cases, poorly understood. But a comprehensive approach to international and national security must transcend the traditional emphasis on military power and arme d competition The real sources of insecurity also enc ompass unsustainable development, and its effects c an become intertwined with traditional forms of confli ct in a manner that can extend and deepen the latte r. I. Environmental Stress as a Source of Conflict 5. Environmental stress is seldom the only cause of major conflicts within or among nations. Neverthel ess, they can arise from the marginalization of sectors of th e population and from ensuing violence. This occurs when political processes are unable to handle the effect s of environmental stress resulting, for example, f rom erosion and desertification. Environmental stress can thus be an important part of the web of causality associ ated with any conflict and can in some cases be catalytic. 6. Poverty, injustice, environmental degradation, a nd conflict interact in complex and potent ways. On e manifestation of growing concern to the internation al community is the phenomenon of 'environmental refugees'/2 The immediate cause of any mass movement of refuge es may appear to be political upheaval and military violence. But the underlying causes often include the deterioration of the natural resource b ase and its capacity to support the population. 7. Events in the Horn of Africa are a case in point . In the early 1970s, drought and famine struck the nation of Ethiopia. Yet it has been found that the hunger and human misery were caused more by years of overuse of soils in the Ethiopian highlands and the resulting severe erosion than by drought. A report commission ed by the Ethiopian Relief and Rehabilitation Commission foun d: 'The primary cause of the famine was not drought of unprecedented severity, but a combination of long-c ontinued bad land use and steadily increased human and stock populations over decades'. /3 8. Wars have always compelled people to leave their homes and their lands, to become refugees. Also, t he wars in our time have forced large numbers of peopl e to leave their homelands. In addition, we now hav e the phenomenon of environmental refugees. In 1984-85, s ome 10 million Africans fled their homes, accountin g for two-thirds of all refugees worldwide. Their flight was not surprising in a region where 35 million suf fered from famine. Many of them swarmed into cities. But many others moved across national boundaries, heightenin g interstate tensions. Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, and Nige ria have been generous in welcoming refugees from t he desertified Sahel. Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe h ave also been receiving large numbers of refugees. Yet, the Cote d'Ivoire, for instance, which depends for much of its export revenues on timber, is suffering rapid deforestation caused in part by land hunger, and on e-third of landless people are immigrants. Agricult ure destroys 4.5 times as much forestland in the Cote d 'Ivoire as logging does. /4 United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 9. Almost 1 million Haitian 'boat people', one-sixt h of the entire populace, have fled that island nat ion, an exodus fuelled in large part by environmental degra dation. Haiti suffers some of the world's most seve re erosion, down to bedrock over large parts of some r egions, so that even farmers with reasonable amount s of land cannot make a living. According to a US Agency for International Development (USAID) report, 'The social and economic effects of environmental degradation a re great, and contribute to the growing outflow fro m rural areas. Thousands of rural Haitians leave their home s each year for Port au Prince, other Caribbean isl ands and the United States in search of employment and bette r living conditions. /5 El Salvador, one of the most troubled nations of Central America, is also one of the most environmentally impoverished, with some of the wor st erosion rates in the region. The fundamental causes of the present conflict are as much environmental as political, stemming from problems of resource distr ibution in an overcrowded land, according to a draf t USAID environmental profile of El Salvador. /6 Today we cannot secure security for one state at th e expense of the other. Security can only be univer sal, but security cannot only be political or military, it m ust be as well ecological, economical, and social. It must ensure the fulfilment of the aspirations of humanity as a whole. A. S. Timoshenko Institute of State and Law, USSR Academy of Science s WCED Public Hearing Moscow, 11 Dec 1986 10. South Africa reveals similar problems. The inhu man policy of apartheid is at the core of the state of political conflict in Southern Africa. One of the many ways b y which apartheid institutionalizes both conflict a nd environmental degradation is by allocating, through the 'homelands' system, 14 per cent of the nation' s land to 72 per cent of the population. /7 Young working-age blacks flee the overcultivated a nd overgrazed 'homelands' to seek work in the cities, where, on top of the sq ualor of overcrowded townships, they encounter extr eme socio-economic inequality and racial segregation. T hey fight back. Repression intensifies, and the vic tims seek refuge over the border - whereupon the South Africa n regime widens the conflict into neighbouring stat es. The entire region is becoming caught up in the ensuing violence, which could well ignite wider conflict dr awing in major powers. 11. In addition to the interrelated problems of pov erty, injustice, and environmental stress, competit ion for non- renewable raw materials, land, or energy can create tension. It was the quest for raw materials that u nderlay much of the competition between colonial powers and the subjugation of their holdings. Conflicts in th e Middle East inevitably contain the seeds of great power in tervention and global conflagration, in part becaus e of the international interest in oil. 12. As unsustainable forms of development push indi vidual countries up against environmental limits, m ajor differences in environmental endowment among countr ies, or variations in stocks of usable land and raw materials, could precipitate and exacerbate interna tional tension and conflict. And competition for us e of the global commons, such as ocean fisheries and Antarct ica, or for use of more localized common resources in fixed supply, such as rivers and coastal waters, co uld escalate to the level of international conflict and to threaten international peace and security. 13. Global water use doubled between 1940 and 1980, and it is expected to double again by 2000, with t wo thirds of the projected water use going to agricult ure. Yet 80 countries, with 40 per cent of the worl d's population, already suffer serious water shortages. /8 There will be growing competition for water for ir rigation, industry, and domestic use. River water disputes ha ve already occurred in North America (the Rio Grand e), South America (the Rio de la Plata and Parana), Sou th and Southeast Asia (the Mekong and the Ganges), Africa (the Nile), and the Middle East (the Jordan, Litani, and Orontes, as well as the Euphrates). How can the world of nature and the community of pe oples with their national economies be harmonized? Posing the question this way suggests that the two are separate. But not so. Humanity, the human speci es, exists and it supported within the world of nature. And I mean that not figuratively but literally. We are deep-air animals living inside an ecological system. We draw boundaries, of course, on the ecos phere for national and regional purposes. But it is all o f one piece. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. When, therefore, we optimistically declare that eco nomic development and environmental maintenance can go along hand in hand, this qualifier must immediately be added: only if the maintenance of the ecosphere is made the first priority. Economic development must be se condary, guided by strict ecological standards. The se fundamental ideas are far from being universally ac cepted. Stanley Rowe Saskatchewan Environmental Society WCED Public Hearing Ottawa, 26-27 May 1986 14. Fisheries, whether coastal or oceanic, are fund amental to the diets of many countries. For some co untries, fishing is a key economic sector, and overfishing p oses immediate dangers to several national economie s. In 1974 Iceland, largely dependent on its fishing indu stry, found itself embroiled with the United Kingdo m in a 'cod war'. Similar tensions exist in the Japanese and Ko rean seas and on both sides of the South Atlantic. The 1986 declaration of an exclusive fishery zone around the Falkland/Malvinas Islands has further unsettled re lations between Britain and Argentina. Disputes over fishin g rights in the South Pacific and the search for tu na by distant-water fleets led to increased competition f or diplomatic and fisheries advantages by the major powers in that region in 1986. Fisheries-related disputes may well become more frequent as nations harvest fish stocks beyond the level of sustainable yields. 15. Environmental threats to security are now begin ning to emerge on a global scale. The most worrisom e of these stem from the possible consequences of global warming caused by the atmospheric build-up of carb on dioxide and other gases. /9 (See Chapter 7 .) Any such climatic change would quite probably be unequal in its effects, disrupting agricultural systems in areas t hat provide a large proportion of the world's cerea l harvests and perhaps triggering mass population movements in areas where hunger is already endemic. Sea levels may rise during the first half of the next century enou gh to radically change the boundaries between coast al nations and to change the shapes and strategic importance o f international waterways - effects both likely to increase international tensions. The climatic and sea-level changes are also likely to disrupt the breeding gro unds of economically important fish species. Slowing, or ad apting to, global warming is becoming an essential task to reduce the risks of conflict. II. Conflict as a Cause of Unsustainable Developmen t 16. Arms competition and armed conflict create majo r obstacles to sustainable development. They make h uge claims on scarce material resources. They pre-empt human resources and wealth that could be used to co mbat the collapse of environmental support systems, the poverty, and the underdevelopment that in combinati on contribute so much to contemporary political insecu rity. They may stimulate an ethos that is antagonis tic towards cooperation among nations whose ecological and economic interdependence requires them to overcome national or ideological antipathies. 17. The existence of nuclear weapons and the destru ctive potential inherent in the velocity and intens ity of modern conventional warfare have given rise to a ne w understanding of the requirements for security am ong nations. In the nuclear age nations can no longer o btain security at each other's expense. They must s eek security through cooperation, agreements, and mutua l restraint; they must seek common security. /10 Hence interdependence, which is so fundamental in the rea lm of environment and economics, is a fact also in the sphere of arms competition and military security. I nterdependence has become a compelling fact, forcin g nations to reconcile their approach to 'security'. 1. Nuclear War - Threat to Civilization 18. The likely consequences of nuclear war make oth er threats, to the environment pale into insignific ance. Nuclear weapons represent a qualitatively new step in the development of warfare. One thermo-nuclear b omb can have an explosive power greater than that of al l the explosives Used in wars since the invention o f gunpowder. In addition to the destructive effects o f blast and heat, immensely magnified by these weap ons, they introduce a new lethal agent - ionizing radiat ion - that extends lethal effects over both space a nd tine. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 19. In recent years, scientists have in addition ca lled our attention to the prospect of 'nuclear wint er'. It has been most authoritatively explored by some 300 scie ntists from the United States, the USSR, and more t han 30 other countries - working on a collaborative basis in some cases across ideological divides. /11 All youth organizations believe that environmental issues stand high on the priority list of global pr oblems. However, their solution depends on the preservation of peace on our planet. The quest of solutions to ecological problems is impossible without the curbi ng of the arms race, for the arms race absorbs trem endous intellectual and material resources of mankind. The solution of ecological problems also depends on th e way of life of young people and their value orientation. Dr. I.I. Russin Moscow State University WCED Public Hearing Moscow, 8 Dec 1986 20. The theory contends that the smoke and dust eje cted into the atmosphere by a nuclear war could abs orb enough solar radiation to remain aloft for some tim e, preventing sunlight from reaching the surface of the earth, causing a widespread and prolonged cooling of land areas. There would be severe repercussions for plan t life generally and for agriculture in particular, disrup ting the production of food to sustain survivors of the war. Great uncertainties remain about the scale and linkages d etermining environmental effects, but large-scale environmental perturbations are considered probable . A nuclear war cannot be won, and must never be fo ught. In the aftermath, there would be no difference betw een so called victor and vanquished. The nuclear-we apon states must spare no effort to conclude a verifiabl e agreement on banning all nuclear weapon tests. 21. The findings on nuclear winter are vitally impo rtant too for non-aligned nations, predominantly in the South, which are not parties to the East West conflict. Th ey cannot expect to avoid the potentially disastrou s environmental consequences of nuclear war in the no rthern hemisphere. The aftermath of such a war woul d envelop the world. There is a danger that nuclear w eapons will spread to more and more countries and b e used in what begins as a limited regional conflict. Beyo nd the five recognized nuclear-weapon states, at le ast six others have a widely acknowledged potential nuclear weapons capability; a dozen others are not far beh ind. The nuclear-weapon states cannot expect the non-nuc lear-weapon states to abstain from exercising the nuclear option in the absence of real progress on t he road to nuclear disarmament. It is imperative, t herefore, that the probable consequences of nuclear war be re cognized universally and that all states become inv olved in efforts to prevent the proliferation - and above al l the use of nuclear weapons. 2. Other Weapons of Mass Destruction 22. Other forms of war and other weapons of mass de struction have large scale effects or both human societies and the human environment. Biological war fare could release new agents of disease that would prove difficult to control. Recent advances in biotechnol ogy multiply the potentially lethal applications of such weapons. Likewise, the deliberate manipulation of t he environment (for example, through artificial ear thquakes and floods) would have consequences far beyond the borders of those involved in a conflict, were they ever used. Chemical agents can seriously damage the envi ronment, as demonstrated by the defoliants used in South-east Asia. The dangerous and environmentally unpredictable consequences of biological and chemic al weapons have led to international agreements bannin g their use. /12 But there is need for further efforts to strengthen the regimes to which these agreements co ntribute. In particular, the Geneva protocol prohib iting the use of chemical weapons should be supplemented by a greements prohibiting the production and stockpilin g of such weapons. 23. Military applications of new technologies now t hreaten lo make outer space a focus of internationa l competition and conflict. (See Chapter 10 .) Most countries in the international community se e space as a global commons that should benefit humanity as a whole and be preserved from military competition - a feeling reflected in the 1967 Outer Space Treaty , under which nations agreed not to deploy weapons of mass destruction there. Governments should now agree on measures to prevent an arms race in space and stop it on Earth. Failing such agreement, the arms race cou ld expand, with dire consequences for humanity. 3. The Costs of the 'Arms Culture' United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 24. The absence of war is not peace; nor does it ne cessarily provide the conditions for sustainable development. Competitive arms races breed insecurit y among nations through spirals of reciprocal fears . Nations need to muster resources to combat environm ental degradation and mass poverty. By misdirecting scarce resources, arms races contribute further to insecurity. 25. The coexistence of substantial military spendin g with unmet human needs has long evoked concern. President Eisenhower, for example, observed at the end his term in office that 'every gun that is made , every warship launched, every rocket fired represents, in the final analysis, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, who are cold and are not clothed'. /13 26. Global military spending in 1985 was well in ex cess of $900 billion. /14 This was more than the total income of the poorest half of humanity. It represented the equivalent of almost $1,000 for every one of the w orld's 1 billion poorest. Put another way, military spending surpassed the combined gross national products of China, India, and the African countries south of the Sahar a. Moreover, global military spending has risen not only absolutely but proportionately - from an estimated 4.7 per cent of world output in 1960 to over 6 per cent - representing an increase of about 150 per cent in r eal (constant price) terms. Three-quarters of curre nt expenditure is in the industrial world. /15 27. The true cost of the arms race is the loss of w hat could have been produced instead with scarce ca pital, labour skills, and raw materials. The plants that m anufacture weapons, the transport of those weapons, and the mining of minerals for their production all place e normous demands on energy and mineral resources and are a major contributor to pollution and environmental de terioration. 28. The distorting effects of the 'arms culture' ar e most striking in the deployment of scientific per sonnel. Half a million scientists are employed on weapons research world-wide, and they account to: around half of al l research and development expenditure. /16 This exceeds the total combined spending on develo ping technologies for new energy sources, improving huma n health, raising agricultural productivity, and co ntrolling pollution. Military research and development - $70- 80 billion world-wide in 1984 - is growing at twice the rate of military spending as a whole. /17 At the same time, there is a paucity of resources available for monitoring global climatic change, for surveying the ecosystem s of disappearing rain forests and spreading desert s, and for developing agricultural technologies appropriat e to rainfed, tropical agriculture. 29. Nations are seeking a new era of economic growt h. The level of spending on arms diminishes the prospects for such an era - especially one that emp hasizes the more efficient use of raw materials, en ergy, and skilled human resources. It also has a bearing, alb eit indirect, on the willingness of rich countries to provide development assistance to developing countries. Cle arly, there is no simple correspondence between red uced defence spending and increased aid. There are other reasons aside from domestic resource constraints f or a reluctance to expand aid, and nations cannot wait f or disarmament before devoting more resources to en suring sustainable development. Nonetheless, increased def ence spending puts pressure on other budgetary item s, and aid is an easy target, despite being a relative ly small outlay for most donor countries. /18 30. Although redeployment is clearly possible, reso urces currently employed in military applications c annot be redeployed quickly or easily elsewhere in other sec tors or other countries. There are technical proble ms in achieving such a transformation, not least the cont ribution made by military spending to jobs in econo mies with high unemployment. And beyond the technical problem s are questions of political will. Nonetheless, som e countries - China, Argentina, and Peru, for example - have recently shown that it is both technically and politically possible to make substantial shifts fro m military to civilian spending within a short time . /19 4. World Armaments and the Growth of the 'Arms Cult ure' 31. Traditionally, nations have adhered to an 'arms culture'. They find themselves locked into arms competitions fuelled among other things by powerful vested interests in the 'military-industrial compl ex' as well as in the armed forces themselves. Industrial natio ns account for most of the military expenditures an d the production and transfer of arms in international so ciety. However, the influence of this 'arms culture ' is not confined to these nations. It is present also in th e developing world, fostered both by the desire of many governments to seek security through acquisition of arms and by a burgeoning world arms trade. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. I have here listened to people speaking about finan cial crises, famine, pollution, and social injustic e at various levels. As an ecologist, I cannot see any of these questions without linking them to the armaments que stion and to the nuclear issue. Poverty generates tensions and conflicts, urban and rural violence. The indigenous people are still aw aiting solutions for their problems. All this depends on m oney and nevertheless we are spending money on our nuclear programmes. They say that this has peaceful objectives. This is not true because precious mone y is being spent on this. The greatest crime: the death of hope, the death of all of the rights we all have, especially that of the young of believing in a future, the hope for a normal life, a difficult life but something that appears as a ch allenge to live it the best we can. We have a right to this chance. Cacilda Lanuza Brazilian Ecological Movement WCED Public Hearing Sao Paulo, 28- 29 Oct 1985 32. Since the early 1960s, military spending in dev eloping countries as a whole has increased fivefold . Their share of total spending increased from under one-te nth to almost a quarter of a far larger total. /20 Some developing countries, such as the Republic of Korea , have achieved a high level of development in spit e of military spending. But systematic analysis suggests that increases in military spending have had negat ive effects on economic performance. /21 33. Moreover, defence expenditure is one of the mos t import-intensive of activities, usually creating a large secondary demand for imported spares, ammunition, s ervicing, training, and fuel. It has been estimated that 20 per cent of the external debt acquired by non-oil d eveloping countries in the decade to 1982 could be attributed to arms imports. /22 And high levels of arms spending motivated by a va riety of reasons have undoubtedly contributed to the severity of the crises of develo pment in Africa, where military spending rose, in r eal terms, by 7.8 per cent per annum between 1971 and 1982, and a rms imports rose by 18.5 per cent. /23 it should be noted in this connection that in the case of the Frontlin e States they have been compelled to expand their a rmed forces because of the threat from South Africa. 34. The development of an 'arms culture' in many de veloping countries presents particular dangers in t he context of environmental and poverty-induced stress es. There are already numerous simmering disputes i n the Third World - over 40 unresolved - many arising fro m boundaries defined in colonial times. 35. Sophisticated weapons can help convert the pote ntial into actual conflict. According to the UN Gro up of Governmental Experts on the Relationship Between Di sarmament and Development: There can no longer be the slightest doubt that res ource scarcities and ecological stresses constitute real and imminent threats to the future well-being of all people and nations. These challenges are fundamentally non-military and it is imperative tha t they be addressed accordingly. If this is not recognized, ... there is a grave risk that the situ ation will deteriorate to the point of crisis where , even with low probability of success, the use of force c ould be seen as a way to produce results quickly enough. This is far from being a remote possibility . In recent years, there has been a marked tendency in international relations to use or to threaten to use military force in response to non-military challenges to security. /24 36. The situation in many developing countries pres ents particular dangers in the context of environme ntal and poverty-induced stresses. Large-scale movements of refugees, competition for scarce water and fertile lands, deposits of oil and raw materials, ill-defined boun daries, and so on all add to tensions and increase possibilities for conflict. The importation of armaments by devel oping countries has increased also because of these real or potential conflicts. It is sometimes encouraged by the arms manufacturers because of the important pro fits that can themselves sustain the manufacture of arms in t he exporting countries. The export of arms have bee n evaluated at more than $35 billion annually. The ar ms trade is estimated to have absorbed over $300 bi llion over the last two decades, three-quarters in the fo rm of sales to developing countries. /25 United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. III. Towards Security and Sustainable Development 1. Principles 37. The first step in creating a more satisfactory basis for managing the interrelationships between s ecurity and sustainable development is to broaden our vision. C onflicts may arise not only because of political an d military threats to national sovereignty; they may derive al so from environmental degradation and the pre-empti on of development options. 38. There are, of course, no military solutions to 'environmental insecurity'. And modern warfare can itself create major internationally shared environmental h azards. Furthermore, the idea of national sovereign ty, has been fundamentally modified by the fact of interdep endence in the realm of economics, environment, and security. The global commons cannot be managed from any national centre: The nation state is insuffici ent to deal with threats to shared ecosystems. Threats to environmental security can only be dealt with by jo int management and multilateral procedures and mechanis ms. Environment must also be an approach to development . Environment is a social justice issue and environ ment even is a peace and security issue. The barriers to achieving sustainable development are great, as mi ght be expected in a major historical transformation, but they are far from insurmountable. We approach the millennium in a world in which glob al interdependence is the central reality, but wher e absolute poverty and environmental degradation clou d our vision of a common future, and where a geopol itical climate dominated by nuclear terrorism and increasi ng militarization saps the idealism of the young an d the will to dream in us all. Ralph Torrie On Behalf of Canadian Environment, Development and Peace Organizations WCED Public Hearing Ottawa, 26-27 May 1986 2. Cooperative Management 39. Already, environmental stresses are encouraging cooperation among nations, giving some indication of ways to proceed. Antarctica is subject to a far-rea ching agreement that provides a collective approach to management. (See Chapter 10 .) There are now various institutional systems, oft en of complex and advanced form, to foster bilateral and regional cooperation for marine fisheries in order to regulate maximum s ustainable yields and the distribution of catches. One of the main threats to the oceans the dumping of highly to xic wastes has so far been managed by the London Dumping Convention . As for international water bodies, impressive progress has been made by the bilateral U.S.-Canadi an Commission for the Great Lakes. The Mediterranea n Convention, only one of the many such treaties conc luded within the context of the UNEP Regional Seas Programme, brings together coastal nations in an ar rangement to monitor and combat pollution at sea. 40. Some of the most challenging problems require c ooperation among nations enjoying different systems of government, or even subject to antagonistic relatio ns. The 1986 Chernobyl reactor accident in the Sovi et Union has resulted in two agreements covering internation al cooperation in cases of such accidents. In the f uture, the nation concerned will immediately alert neighbourin g states; they, in turn, will offer assistance at c ost and free of liability. /26 The 1979 Convention on Transboundary Pollution has provided a framework for monitoring and assessing damage from pollutants causing acid rain in Europe. /27 41. Cooperation on environmental issues among devel oping countries has often been made difficult by po or communications. Nonetheless, many now participate i n UNEP's Regional Seas Programme. The nations of th e Sahel have formed a regional organization to deal w ith desertification, and there ie emerging a body o f successful case histories with respect to river bas in development: Witness the joint management progra mmes in Africa for the Senegal River Basin.

Box 11-1 Spending on Military Versus Environmental Security The world spent well over $900 billion on military purposes in 1985, more than $2.5 billion a day. The real cost is what the same resources might otherwise be used for: An Action Plan for Tropical Forests would cost $1. 3 billion a year over the course of five years. Thi s annual sum is the equivalent of half a day of milit ary expenditure worldwide. Implementing the UN Action Plan for Desertificatio n would cost $4.5 billion a year during the last tw o decades of this century - the equivalent of less th an two days of military spending. One of the greatest environmental hazards in the T hird World is lack of clean water for household use , contributing to 80 per cent of disease. The UN Wate r and Sanitation Decade, although given only a smal l fraction of support needed, would have cost $30 bil lion a year during the 1980s. This is the approxima te equivalent of 10 days of military spending. To supply contraceptive materials to all women alr eady motivated to use family planning would cost an additional $1 billion per year on top of the $2 bil lion spent today. This additional $1 billion is the equivalent of 10 hours of military spending.

Agarwal et al., Water, Sanitation an d Health for All? (London: IIED/Earthscan, 1981); W orld Bank, World Development Report, 1984 (New York: Oxf ord University Press, 1984). 3. The Importance of Early Warning 42. Since it is often uncertainty and insecurity th at prompts international conflict, it is of the utm ost importance that governments become aware of imminent environme ntal stress before the damage actually threatens co re national interests. Governments are usually not wel l equipped with this kind of foresight. 43. It would be highly desirable if the appropriate international organizations, including appropriate UN bodies and regional organizations, were to pool their reso urces and draw on the most sophisticated surveillan ce technology available - to establish a reliable earl y wanting system for environmental risks and confli ct. (See Chapter 12 .) such a system would monitor indicators of risks and potential disputes, such as soil erosion, growth in regional migration, and uses of commons t hat are approaching the thresholds of sustainabilit y. The organizations would also offer their services for h elping the respective countries to establish princi ples and institutions for joint management. 4. Disarmament and Security 44. Action to reduce environmental threats to secur ity requires a redefinition of priorities, national ly and globally. Such a redefinition could evolve through the widespread acceptance of broader forms of secur ity assessment and embrace military, political, environ mental, and other sources of conflict. 45. A broader approach to security assessment would no doubt find many cases in which national, region al, and global security could be enhanced through expen ditures quite small in relation to the levels of mi litary spending. Four of the most urgent global environmen tal requirements - relating to tropical forests, wa ter, desertification, and population - could be funded w ith the equivalent of less than one month's global military spending. (See Box 11-1.) It is difficult to shift budgetary resources, but individual governments hav e already shown that transformation is possible, given politi cal will. In some of the countries most seriously a ffected by environmental stress and poverty, the sums required to alleviate these conditions are small in relatio n to what is now spent on disaster relief, let alone military ac tivities. /28 However, these sums must be spent quickly, before deteriorating conditions require much larger expend itures.

But in terms of the aggregate resources involve d in arms spending and the potential throat to the environment from war, the greatest need is to impro ve relations among those major powers capable of deploying weapons of mass destruction. This is need ed to achieve agreement on tighter control over the proliferation and testing of various types of weapo ns of mass destruction nuclear and non-nuclear incl uding those that have environmental implications. /29 47. A substantial number of agreements already show the potential for negotiated, multilateral solutio ns. President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev ma de substantial progress towards strategic arms agreement, which must be carried forward to reverse the alarming trends of several decades. Apparently , the two major powers came close to agreeing on intermed iate range systems in Europe, to be followed by agreements banning forward deployment of shorter ra nge systems. It would alleviate significantly the p ressures exercised by nuclear weapons on the security order in Europe. In addition, they are moving towards, a 50 per cent reduction agreement on strategic systems, foll owed by total elimination agreements. They also nee d to agree on effective measures to prevent an arms race in space. Successful negotiations would contribute significantly to stemming the spread of nuclear wea pons as the major nuclear-weapon states would deliv er on their promise to build down their nuclear arsenals. Such progress is consistent with the basic needs o f our times and the right of humanity to have the spectre of nuclear destruction removed from the face of th e Earth. 48. Nations must turn away from the destructive log ic of an 'arms culture' and focus instead or their common future. The level of armaments and the destruction they could bring about bear no relation to the poli tical conflict that triggered the arms competition in the first place. Nations must not become prisoners of their own arms race. They must face the common danger inheren t in the weapon of the nuclear age. They must face the common challenge of providing for sustainable devel opment and act in concert to remove the growing environmental sources of conflict.

The figure of total military spending is neces sarily approximate because of the enormous problems of aggregating spending in different - and often non-c onvertible - currencies and from countries with dif ferent statistical conventions. According to Sivard, total military spending in 1983 was $728 billion. On the basis of trends and preliminary data, a figure of at least $ 900 billion and possibly $1,000 billion in current prices and exchange rates seems appropriate for 1986. 15/ Sivard, 1986 edition, op. cit., SIPRI Yearbook, op. cit. 16/ Sivard, 1986 edition, op. cit., SIPRI Yearbook, op. cit. 17/ M.

For the United States, fore ign aid accounts for 4 per cent of armaments spendi ng, and for the USSR, 1.5 per cent. In Austria, Denmark , the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden, by contrast, the proportion is close to 30 per cent, and it is over 10 per cent for Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, FRG, and Switzerland, United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 19/ According to L.H. Brown et al., in State of the World 1986 (London: W.W. Norton, 1986), China in 1 972 spent 14 per cent of its gross national product (GN P) on military purposes, one of the highest levels in the world. Since 1970 (except for 1979), the government has systematically reduced this until by 1985 it a mounted to only 7.5 per cent In mid 1985 the government ann ounced it would cut the armed forces to 3.2 million , a drop of 24 per cent. In Argentina, by 1984 new President Raul Alfonsin had cut arms outlays to half their p eak level of 1980 (nearly 4 per cent of GNP) by reordering pr iorities and shifting resources to social programme s. Peruvian President Alan Garcia Perez, on taking off ice in mid-1985, announced he would reduce military outlays, which then totalled 5 per cent of GNP, or one-quarter of the federal budget. First he cancell ed half the order for 26 French Mirage fighter planes. 20/ Over 1960-81, Third World military expenditures grew by some 7 per cent per year, as compared with 3.7 per cent in the industrial world. In 1960, Third Wo rld military expenditures accounted for less than o ne-tenth of the global total 1981 for more than one fifth of a far larger total. R.L.

By contrast, the amount req uired to counter Ethiopia's famine during 1985 amou nted to $500 million for relief measures alone.

A Call for Action United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 1. In the middle or the 20th century, we saw our pl anet from space for the first time. Historians may eventually find that this vision had a greater impact on thoug ht than did the Copernican revolution of the 16th c entury, which upset humans' self-image by revealing that th e Earth is not the centre of the universe. From spa ce, we see a small and fragile ball dominated not by human activity and edifice but by a pattern of clouds, o ceans, greenery, and soils. Humanity's inability to fit it s activities into that pattern is changing planetar y systems fundamentally. Many such changes are accompanied by life-threatening hazards, from environmental degradation to nuclear destruction. These new reali ties, from which there is no escape, must be recogn ized - and managed. 2. The issues we have raised in this report are ine vitably of far reaching importance to the quality o f life on earth - indeed to life itself. We have tried to sho w how human survival and well-being could depend on success in elevating sustainable development to a global et hic. In doing so, we have called for such major eff orts as greater willingness and cooperation to combat inter national poverty, to maintain peace and enhance sec urity world-wide, and to manage the global commons. We ha ve called for national and international action in respect of population, food, plant and animal species, ener gy, industry, and urban settlements. The previous c hapters have described the policy directions required. 3. The onus for action lies with no one group of na tions. Developing countries face the challenges of desertification, deforestation, and pollution, and endure most of the poverty associated with environm ental degradation. The entire human family of nations wou ld suffer from the disappearance of rain forests in the tropics, the loss of plant and animal species, and changes in rainfall patterns. Industrial nations fa ce the challenges of toxic chemicals, toxic wastes, and ac idification. All nations may suffer from the releas es by industrialized countries of carbon dioxide and of g ases that react with the ozone layer, and from any future war fought with the nuclear arsenals controlled by thos e nations. All nations will also have a role to pla y in securing peace, in changing trends, and in righting an inter national economic system that increases rather than decreases inequality, that increases rather than de creases numbers of poor and hungry. In the case of environmental problems, it is obviou s that the problems cannot be solved by one group, one group working in separation. You cannot say because people are dying of poisoning, it is the Ministry of Health that will solve it. Or to say because it comes from factories, it is the Ministry of Industry. That is impossible. I think the problems need a more holistic approach. The United Nations Organization, as a professional organization, has developed this fragmentation. It started automatically with no bad intention at all. But at the same time, the member countries requested and natio nal bodies also requested entry points in recipient countries. So WHO corresponds with the Ministry of Health, UNESCO corresponds with the Ministry of Education, FAO corresponds with the Ministry of Agr iculture the fragmentation is getting worse. Speaker from the floor Government Agency WCED Public Hearing Jakarta, 26 March 1985 4. The time has come to break out of past patterns. Attempts to maintain social and ecological stabili ty through old approaches to development and environmental pro tection will increase instability. Security must be sought through change. The Commission has noted a number o f actions that must be taken to reduce risks to sur vival and to put future development on paths that are sus tainable. 5. Without such reorientation of attitudes and emph asis, little can be achieved. We have no illusions about 'quick-fix' solutions. We have tried to point out s ome pathways to the future. But there is no substit ute for the journey itself, and there is no alternative to the process by which we retain a capacity to respond to the experience it provides. We believe this to hold tru e in all the areas covered in this report. But the policy changes we have suggested have institutional implic ations, and it is to these we now turn emphasizing that they are a complement to, not a substitute for, the wider policy changes for which we call. Nor do the y represent definitive solutions, but rather first st eps in what will be a continuing process. 6. In what follows we put forward, in the first pla ce, what are essentially conceptual guidelines for institutions at the national level. We recognize that there are lar ge differences among countries in respect of popula tion size, resources, income level, management capacity, and i nstitutional traditions, only governments themselve s can United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. formulate the changes they should make. Moreover, t he tools for monitoring and evaluating sustainable development are rudimentary and require further ref inement. 7. We also address, in more specific terms, the que stion of international institutions. The preceding chapters have major implications for international cooperati on and reforms, both economic and legal. The intern ational agencies clearly have an important role in making t hese changes effective, and we endeavour to set out the institutional implications, especially as regards t he United Nations system. I. The Challenge for Institutional and Legal Change 1. Shifting the Focus to the Policy Sources 8. The next few decades are crucial for the future of humanity. Pressures on the planet are now unprec edented and are accelerating at rates and scales new to hum an experience: a doubling of global population in a few decades, with most of the growth in cities; a five- to tenfold increase in economic activity in less t han half a century; and the resulting pressures for growth and changes in agricultural, energy, and industrial sy stems. Opportunities for more sustainable forms of growth and development are also growing. New technologies and potentially unlimited access to information offer g reat promise. 9. Each area of change represents a formidable chal lenge in its own right, but the fundamental challen ge stems from their systemic character. They lock together e nvironment and development, once thought separate; they lock together 'sectors' such as industry and agricu lture; and they lock countries together as the effe cts of national policies and actions spill over national b orders. Separate policies and institutions can no l onger cope effectively with these interlocked issues. Nor can nations, acting unilaterally. 10. The integrated and interdependent nature of the new challenges and issues contrasts sharply with t he nature of the institutions that exist today. These institutions tend to be independent, fragmented, an d working to relatively narrow mandates with closed decision pro cesses. Those responsible for managing natural reso urces and protecting the environment are institutionally separated from those responsible for managing the e conomy. The real world of interlocked economic and ecologic al systems will not change; the policies and instit utions concerned must. 11. This new awareness requires major shifts in the way governments and individuals approach issues of environment, development, and international coopera tion. Approaches to environment policy can be broad ly characterized in two ways. One, characterized as th e 'standard agenda', reflects an approach to enviro nmental policy, laws, and institutions that focuses on envi ronmental effects. The second reflects an approach concentrating on the policies that are the sources of those effects. /1 These two approaches represent distinctively different ways of looking both at the issues and at the institutions to manage them. 12. The effects-oriented 'standard agenda' has tend ed to predominate as a result of growing concerns a bout the dramatic decline in environmental quality that the industrialized world suffered during the 1950s and 1960s. New environmental protection and resource managemen t agencies were added on to the existing institutio nal structures, and given mainly scientific staffs. /2 13. These environment agencies have registered some notable successes in improving environmental quali ty during the past two decades. /3 They have secured significant gains in monitoring and research and in defining and understanding the issues in scientific and tech nical terms. They have raised public awareness, nat ionally and internationally. Environmental laws have induce d innovation and the development of new control technologies, processes, and products in most indus tries, reducing the resource content of growth. /4 14. However, most of these agencies have been confi ned by their own mandates to focusing almost exclus ively on the effects. Today, the sources of these effects must be tackled. While these existing environmenta l protection policies and agencies must be maintained and even strengthened, governments now need to tak e a much broader view of environmental problems and pol icies. 15. Central agencies and major sectoral ministries play key roles in national decision making. These a gencies have the greatest influence on the form, character, and distribution of the impacts of economic activi ty on the environmental resource base. It is these agencies, through their policies and budgets, that determine whether United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. the environmental resource base is enhanced or degr aded and whether the planet will be able to support human and economic growth and change into the next century. 16. The mandated goals of these agencies include in creasing investment, employment, food, energy, and other economic and social goods. Most have no mandate to concern themselves with sustaining the environmenta l resource capital on which these goals depend. Those with such mandates are usually grouped in separate environment agencies or, sometimes, in minor units within sectoral agencies. In either case, they usua lly learn of new initiatives in economic and trade policy, or in energy and agricultural policy, or of new tax m easures that will have a severe impact on resources, long after the effective decisions have been taken. Even if th ey were to learn earlier, most lack the authority to ensure th at a given policy is implemented. 17. Environmental protection and sustainable develo pment must be an integral part of the mandates of a ll agencies of governments, of international organizat ions, and of major private-sector institutions. The se must be made responsible and accountable for ensuring that their policies, programmes, and budgets encourage a nd support activities that are economically and ecolog ically sustainable both in the short and longer ter ms.They must be given a mandate to pursue their traditional goals in such a way that those goals are reinforce d by a steady enhancement of the environmental resource ba se of their own national community and of the small planet we all share. 2. New Imperatives for International Cooperation 18. National boundaries have become so porous that traditional distinctions between local, national, a nd international issues have become blurred. Policies formerly considered to be exclusively matters of 'n ational concern' now have an impact on the ecological bases of other nations' development and survival. Conver sely, the growing reach of some nations' policies - econo mic, trade, monetary, and most sectoral policies - into the 'sovereign' territory of other nations limits the a ffected nations' options in devising national solut ions to their 'own' problems. This fast-changing context for nati onal action has introduced new imperatives and new opportunities for international cooperation. 19. The international legal framework must also be significantly strengthened in support of sustainabl e development. Although international law related to environment has evolved rapidly since the 1972 Stockholm Conference , major gaps and deficiencies must still be overcom e as part of the transition to sustainable development. Much of the evidence and conclusions p resented in earlier chapters of this report calls i nto question not just the desirability but even the fea sibility of maintaining an international system tha t cannot prevent one or several states from damaging the eco logical basis for development and even the prospect s for survival of any other or even all other states. 20. However, just at the time when nations need inc reased international cooperation, the will to coope rate has sharply declined. By the mid-1980s, multilateral in stitutions were under siege for many, and often con tradictory, reasons. The UN system has come under increasing at tack for either proposing to do too much or, more frequently, for apparently doing too little. Confli cting national interests have blocked significant i nstitutional reforms and have increased the need for fundamental change. /5 By the mid-1980s, funds for many international organizations had levelled off or dec lined in both relative and absolute terms. 21. Bilateral development assistance has declined a s a percentage of GNP in many industrial countries, falling even further below the targets proposed in the earl y 1970s. /6 The benefits and effectiveness of aid have come under serious question, in part because of criticis m based on environmental considerations. /7 Yet, sustainable development creates the need for even greater inter national aid and cooperation. 22. Nations must now confront a growing number, fre quency, and scale of crises. A major reorientation is needed in many policies and institutional arrangeme nts at the international as well as national level. The time has come to break away. Dismal scenarios of mountin g destruction of national and global potential for development - indeed, of the Earth's capacity to su pport life - are not inescapable destiny. One of th e most hopeful characteristics of the changes the world is racing through is that invariably they reflect gre at opportunities for sustainable development, providin g that institutional arrangements permit sustainabl e policy options to be elaborated, considered, and implement ed. II. Proposals for Institutional and Legal Change United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 23. The ability to choose policy paths that are sus tainable requires that the ecological dimensions of policy be considered at the same time as the economic, trade, energy, agricultural, industrial, and other dimens ions - on the same agendas and in the same national and inter national institutions. That is the chief institutio nal challenge of the 1990s. 24. There are significant proposals for institution al and legal change in previous chapters of our rep ort. The Commission's proposals for institutional and legal change at the national, regional, and international levels are embodied in six priority areas: getting at the sources, dealing with the effects, assessing global risks, making informed choices, providing the legal means, and investing in our future. Together, these priorities represent the main direc tions for institutional and legal change needed to make the transition to sustainable development. Concerted ac tion is needed under all six. 1. Getting at the Sources 1.1 National Policies and Institutions 25. The way countries achieve sustainable developme nt will vary among the many different political and economic systems around the world. Governments diff er greatly in their capacity to monitor and evaluat e sustainable development, and many will need assista nce. Several features should be common to most countries. 26. Sustainable development objectives should be in corporated in the terms of reference of those cabin et and legislative committees dealing with national econom ic policy and planning as well as those dealing wit h key sectoral and international policies. As an extensio n of this, the major central economic and sectoral agencies of governments should now be made directly responsible and fully accountable for ensuring that their poli cies, programmes, and budgets support development that is ecologically as well as economically sustainable. 27. Where resources and data permit, an annual repo rt and an audit on changes in environmental quality and in the stock of the nation's environmental resource assets are needed to complement the traditional an nual fiscal budget and economic development plans. /8 These are essential to obtain an accurate picture of the true health and wealth of the national economy, and to a ssess progress towards sustainable development. /9 All governments should develop a 'foreign policy fo r the environment' as one major way of improving th e international coordination of national environmenta l policies. But in the long-term perspective, and here I think the World Commission could have an important messag e, I think that it will be politically sound and wise to get support from the NGOs to prepare for changes t hat have to take place anyway sooner or later. So I think it wo uld be politically wise to look into that in a much broader way than what has been done so far. Mats Segnestam Swedish Society for the Conservation of Nature WCED Public Hearing Oslo, 24-25 June 1985 28. Governments who have not done so should conside r developing a 'foreign policy for the environment' . /10 A nation's foreign policy needs to reflect the fact t hat its policies have a growing impact on the envir onmental United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. resource base of other nations and the commons, jus t as the policies of other nations have an impact o n its own. This is true of certain energy, agricultural, and other sectoral policies discussed in this repor t, as well as certain foreign investment, trade, and development assistance policies and those concerning the import or export of hazardous chemicals, wastes, and technolo gy. 1.2 Regional and Interregional Action 29. The existing regional and subregional organisat ions within and outside the UN system need to be strengthened and made responsible and accountable f or ensuring that their programmes and budgets encourage and support sustainable development polic ies and practices. In some areas, however, especial ly among developing countries, new regional and subreg ional arrangements will be needed to deal with transboundary environmental resource issues. 30. Some countries already enjoy comparatively well developed bilateral and regional structures, altho ugh many of them lack the mandate and support required to carry out the greatly expanded role they must as sume in the future. These include many specialized bilat eral organizations such as the Canada/USA Internati onal Joint Commission; subregional agencies in Europe su ch as the different Commissions for the Rhine River , the Danube River, and the Baltic Sea; and organizations such as the CMEA, OECD, and EEC. These bodies provide member countries with a strong foundation o n which to build. Although most of them have effect ive programmes for international cooperation on environ mental protection and natural resources management, these programmes will need to be strengthened and a dapted to new priorities. The regional organization s in particular need to do more to integrate environment fully in their macroeconomic, trade, energy, and o ther sectoral programmes. 31. Similar organizations among developing countrie s should be strengthened, particularly at bilateral and subregional levels. Organizations such as the Organ ization of African Unity, the Southern Africa Devel opment Coordination Conference, the Gulf Cooperation Counc il, the Arab League, the Organisation of American States, the Association of South East Asian Nations , and the South Asian Association for Regional Coop eration could work together to develop contingency plans an d the capacity to respond quickly to critical situa tions and issues. They need in such bodies to develop compara ble economic and environmental statistics, base-lin e quantity and quality surveys of shared resources, a nd early-warning capabilities to reduce environment and development hazards. They could develop and apply i n concert basic common principles and guidelines concerning environmental protection and resource us e, particularly with respect to foreign trade and investment. In this respect, developing countries h ave much to gain through sharing their common exper iences and taking common action. 32. A new focus on the sustainable use and manageme nt of transboundary ecological zones, systems, and resources is also needed. There are, for example, o ver 200 distinct biogeographic zones in the world. Moreover, most non-island countries in the world sh are at least one international river basin. The ent ire national territories of nearly one-quarter of those countrie s is part of an international river, basin. Yet ove r one-third of the 200 major international river basins in the wor ld are not covered by any international agreement, and fewer than 30 have any cooperative institutional arrangem ents. These gaps are particularly acute in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, which together have 144 internationa l river basins. /11 33. Governments, directly and through UNEP and IUCN , should support the development of regional and subregional cooperative arrangements for the protec tion and sustained use of transboundary ecological systems with joint action programmes to combat comm on problems such as desertification and acidificati on. 1.3 Global Institutions and Programmes 34. At the global level, an extensive institutional capacity exists that could be redirected towards s ustainable development. The United Nations, as the only interg overnmental organization with universal membership, should clearly be the locus for new institutional i nitiatives of a global character. 35. Although the funds flowing to developing countr ies through UN programmes represents a relatively s mall portion of total ODA flows, the UN can and should b e a source of significant leadership in the transit ion to sustainable development and in support of developin g countries in effecting this transition. Under exi sting United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. conditions the UN system's influence is often fragm ented and less effective than it might be because o f the independent character of the specialized agencies a nd endemic weaknesses of coordination. However, rec ent moves towards organizational reform and greater eco nomy and efficiency could improve the capacity of t he UN to provide this leadership, and should include sust ainable development as an important criterion. In retrospect, even if the institutional and policy goals of the decade had been achieved, one is left with the feeling that most developing countries would be onl y marginally better off than they are today. The re ason for this is a striking and humbling one. Although gover nments, environmentalists, and the aid agencies kep t their eye on the environmental ball during the 1970s and the early 1980s, recent events have starkly demonst rated that they were watching the wrong ball. While the w orld was worrying about the environmental impacts o f investments, controlling pollution, and conserving resources, we collectively failed to notice the dra matic decline in what had complacently been called 'renew able resources'. David Runnals International Institute for Environment and Develop ment WCED Public Hearing Ottawa, 26-27 May 1986 36. All major international bodies and agencies of the UN system should be made responsible and accoun table for ensuring that their programmes and budgets enco urage and support development policies and practice s that are sustainable. Governments, through parallel resolutions in the respective governing bodies, sh ould now begin to reorient and refocus the mandates, program mes, and budgets of key agencies to support sustain able development. They should also insist on much greate r coordination and cooperation among them. 37. Each agency will need to redeploy some staff an d financial resources to establish a small but high -level centre of leadership and expertise. That centre sho uld be linked to the programme planning and budget processes. 38. Each agency should be directly responsible (or ensuring that the environmental and resource aspect s of programmes and projects are properly taken into acc ount when they are being planned, and that the fina ncial resources needed are provided directly from its own budget. In line with these new responsibilities, t he following bodies should also assume full financial responsibility within their own budgets for certain programmes presently supported by the Environment F und of UNEP: WHO on 'Environmental Health', FAO th e Environment', DIESA on 'Environmental Aspects of Development Planning and 'E ducation', and UNDP on 'Technical Cooperation'. UNEP (discussed extensively in the next section) sh ould continue to cooperate closely with these agenc ies and help identify new programme needs and monitor perfo rmance. 39. As in each agency, there is also a need for a h igh-level centre of leadership for the UN system as a whole with the capacity to assess, advise, assist, and re port on progress made and needed for sustainable development. That leadership should be provided by the Secretary-General of the United Nations Organiz ation. 40. Governments at the UN General Assembly should t herefore take the necessary measures to reinforce t he system-wide responsibility and authority of the UN Secretary-General concerning interagency coordinati on and cooperation generally, and for achieving sustainabl e development specifically. This will require that the representatives of those same governments in the go verning bodies of all major UN organizations and specialized agencies take complementary measures. T his could be done as an integral part of the parall el resolutions just proposed on building sustainable d evelopment objectives and criteria into the mandate s, programmes, and budget of each agency 41. To help launch and guide the interagency coordi nation and cooperation that will be needed, the UN Secretary-General should constitute under his chair manship a special UN Board for Sustainable Developm ent. The principal function of the Board would be to agr ee on combined tasks to be undertaken by the agenci es to deal effectively with the many critical issues of s ustainable development that cut across agency and n ational boundaries. 2. Dealing With the Effects United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 42. Governments should also strengthen the role and capacity of existing environmental protection and resource management agencies. /12 2.1 National Environmental Protection and Natural R esources Management Agencies 43. Strengthening of environmental agencies is need ed most urgently in developing countries. Those tha t have not established such agencies should do so as a mat ter of priority. In both cases, bilateral and multi lateral organizations must be prepared to provide increased assistance for institutional development. Some of this increased financial support should go to community groups and NGOs, which are rapidly emerging as important and cost-effective partners in work to pr otect and improve the environment locally and natio nally, and in developing and implementing national conservatio n strategies. 44. Industrialized countries also need greatly stre ngthened environmental protection and resource management agencies. Most face a continuing backlog of pollution problems and a growing range of environment and resource management problems too. I n addition, these agencies will be called upon to a dvise and assist central economic and sectoral agencies h e they take up their new responsibilities for susta inable development. Many now provide institutional support , technical advice, and assistance to their counter part agencies in developing countries, and this need wil l grow. And, almost inevitably, they will play a la rger and more direct role in international cooperation, work ing with other countries and international agencies trying to cope with regional and global environmental problem s. 2.2 Strengthen the United Nations Environment Progr amme 45. When UNEP was established in 1972, the UN Gener al Assembly gave it a broad and challenging mandate to stimulate, coordinate, and provide policy guidan ce for environmental action throughout the UN syste m. /13 That mandate was to be carried out by a Governing C ouncil of 58 member states, a high-level UN interag ency Environment Coordination Board (ECB), /14 a relatively small secretariat located in Nairobi, and a voluntary fund set initially at a level of $100 million for t he first five years. UNEP's principal task was to e xercise leadership and a catalytic influence on the program mes and projects of other international organizatio ns, primarily in but also outside the UN system. Over t he past 10 years, the Environment Fund has levelled off at around $30 million annually, while its range of tas ks and activities have increased substantially. 46. This Commission has recommended a major reorien tation and refocusing of programmes and budgets on sustainable development in and among all UN organiz ations. Within such a new system-wide commitment to and priority effort on sustainable development, UNE P should be the principal source on environmental d ata, assessment, reporting, and related support for envi ronmental management as well as be the principal ad vocate and agent for change and cooperation on critical en vironment and natural resource protection issues. T he major priorities and functions of UNEP should be: to provide leadership, advice, and guidance in the UN system on restoring, protecting, and improving the ecological basis for sustainable development; to monitor, assess, and report regularly on change s in the state of the environment and natural resou rces (through its EarthWatch programme); to support priority scientific and technological r esearch on critical environmental and natural resou rce protection issues; to develop criteria and indicators for environment al quality standards and guidelines for the sustain able use and management of natural resources; to support and facilitate the development of actio n plans for key ecosystems and issues to be implemented and financed by the governments directl y concerned; to encourage and promote international agreements on critical issues identified by Earthwatch and to support and facilitate the development of internati onal law, conventions, and cooperative arrangements for environmental and natural resource conservation and protection; United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. to support the development of the institutional an d professional capacity of developing countries in all of these areas and help them develop specific programm es to deal with their problems and advise and assist development assistance agencies in this resp ect; and to provide advice and assistance to the United Nat ions Development Programme, the World Bank, and other UN organizations and agencies regarding the e nvironmental dimensions of their programmes and technical assistance projects, including training a ctivities. The environment has quickly deteriorated in certain areas and we don't know where to put the threshold s for nature's tolerance. We must move very fast towards a consensus on the necessity for taking urgent acti on. There is a strong popular support for this in our c ountry. The findings of several opinion polls tell us that ecological issues have heightened priority. People feel anxious about the legacy our generation will b e passing on to the next one. A new environmental awareness h as germinated among large sections of the community and mainly among young people. Dr. Litre V. Nagy Environment Protection Committee of the Patriotic P eople's Front, Hungary WCED Public Hearing Moscow, 6 Dec 1986 2.2.1 Focus on Environmental Protection Issues 47. UNEP has been a key agent in focusing the atten tion of governments on critical environmental probl ems (such as deforestation and marine pollution), in he lping develop many global and regional action plans and strategies (as on desertification), in contributing to the negotiation and implementation of internati onal conventions (on Protection of the Ozone Layer , for example), and in preparing global guidelines and principles for action by governments (such as on marine pollut ion from land-based sources). UNEP's Regional Seas Programme has been particularly successful, and cou ld serve as a model for some other areas of special concern, especially international river basins. 48. UNEP's catalytic and coordinating role in the U N system can and should be reinforced and extended. In its future work in critical environmental protection is sues, UNEP should focus particularly on: developing, testing, and helping to apply practica l and simple methodologies for environmental assessment at project and national levels; extending international agreements (such as on che micals and hazardous wastes) more widely; extending the Regional Seas Programme; developing a similar programme for international r iver basins; and identifying the need for and advising other UN org anizations and agencies in establishing and carryin g out technical assistance and training courses for e nvironmental protection and management. 2.2.2 Priority to Global Environmental Assessment a nd Reporting 49. Although more is known about the state of the g lobal environment now than a decade ago, there are still major gaps and a limited international capability f or monitoring, collecting, and combining basic and comparable data needed for authoritative overviews of key envi ronmental issues and trends. Without such, the info rmation needed to help set priorities and develop effective policies will remain limited. 50. UNEP, as the main UN source for environmental d ata, assessment, and reporting, should guide the gl obal agenda for scientific research and technological de velopment \"or environmental protection. To this end , the data collection, assessment, and state of the envir onment reporting sections (Earthwatch) of UNEP need to be significantly strengthened as a major priority. The Global Environment Monitoring System should be exp anded as rapidly as possible, and the development of the Global Resource Information Database should be accelerated to bridge the gap between environmental assessment and management. Special priority should be United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. accorded to providing support to developing countri es to enable them to participate fully in and deriv e maximum benefits from these programmes. 2.2.3 Strengthen International Environmental Cooper ation 51. The UNEP Governing Council cannot fulfil its pr imary role of providing leadership and policy guida nce in the UN system nor have a significant influence on natio nal policies unless governments increase their part icipation and the level of representation. National delegatio ns to future meetings should preferably be led by M inisters, with their senior policy and scientific advisers. S pecial provisions should be made for expanded and m ore meaningful participation by major non governmental organizations at future sessions. 2.2.4. Increase the Revenue and Focus of the Enviro nment Fund 52. The UNEP voluntary funding base of $30 million annually is too limited and vulnerable for an inter national fund dedicated to serving and protecting the common interests, security, and future of humanity. Six c ountries alone provided over 75 per cent of the 1985 contrib utions to the Environment Fund (the United States, Japan, USSR, Sweden, FRG, and UK). /15 Considering the critical importance of renewed eff orts on environmental protection and improvement, the Commission appeals to all governments to substantially enlarge the Environment Fund both through direct contributions by all members of the UN and through some of the so urces cited later in this chapter in the section 'Investi ng in Our Future'. 53. A substantial enlargement of the Environment Fu nd seems unlikely in the current climate of financi al austerity. Any additional funds made available by s tates for UN development programmes and activities will likely be channelled largely through UNDP and the d evelopment programmes of other UN agencies. Moreove r, as recommended earlier, the budgets of all of those agencies should be deployed so that environmental considerations are built into the planning and impl ementation of all programmes and projects. 54. The Environment Fund can be made more effective by refocusing the programme on fewer activities. A s other UN agencies assume full responsibility for ce rtain activities now provided through the Environme nt Fund and finance them entirely from their own budgets, s ome resources will be released for other purposes. These should be concentrated on the principal functions a nd priority areas identified earlier. 55. Expanding support and cooperation with NGOs cap able of carrying out elements of UNEP's programme w ill also increase the effectiveness of the Environment Fund. Over the last decade, non-governmental organizations and networks have become increasingly important in work to improve environmental protect ion locally, nationally, and internationally. However, financial support from the Environment Fund for coo perative projects with NGOs declined in both absolute and re lative terms in the last 10 years, from $4.5 millio n (23 per cent of the Fund) in 1976 to $3.6 million (13 per c ent) in 1985. /16 The amount and proportion of Environment Fund resources for cooperation and projects with NG Os should be significantly increased by using the capacities of those NGOs that can contribute to UNE P's programmes on a cost-effective basis. 3. Assessing Global Risks 56. The future - even a sustainable future - will b e marked by increasing risk. /17 The risks associated with new technologies are growing. /18 The numbers, scale, frequency, and impact of natur al and human-caused disasters are mounting. 19 / The risks of irreversible damage to natural syste ms regionally (for example through acidification, desertification, or deforestation) a nd globally (through ozone layer depletion or clima te change) are becoming significant. /20 57. Fortunately, the capacity to monitor and map Ea rth change and to assess risk is also growing rapid ly. Data from remote sensing platforms in space can now be m erged with data from conventional land-based source s. Augmented by digital communications and advanced in formation analysis, photos, mapping, and other techniques, these data can provide up-to-date infor mation on a wide variety of resource, climatic, pol lution, and other variables. /21 High-speed data communications technologies, inclu ding the personal computer, enable this information to be shared by individuals as wel l as corporate and governmental users at costs that are steadily falling. Concerted efforts should be made to ensure that all nations gain access to them and the information they provide either directly or through the UNEP Earthwatch and other special programmes. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 58. Governments, individually and collectively, hav e the principal responsibility to collect their inf ormation systematically and use it to assess risks, but to d ate only a few have developed a capacity to do so. Some intergovernmental agencies have a capacity to colle ct and assess information required for risk assessm ent, such as FAO on soil and forest cover and on fisheri es; WMO on climate; UNEP on deserts, pollutants, an d regional seas; quasi-governmental organizations lik e IUCN have a similar capacity. These are only a fe w examples from a long list. But no intergovernmental agency has been recognized as the centre of leader ship to stimulate work on risk assessment and to provide an authoritative source of reports and advice on evol ving risks. This gap needs to be filled both within and among governments. Beyond our proposal that the glo bal environment assessment and reporting functions of U NEP should be significantly strengthened, the Commission would now propose that UNEP's Earthwatch be recognized as the centre of leadership on risk assessment in the UN system. 59. But neither UNEP nor other intergovernmental or ganizations can be expected to carry out these impo rtant functions alone. To be effective, given the politic ally sensitive nature of many of the most critical risks, intergovernmental risk assessment needs to be suppo rted by independent capacities outside of governmen t. Several national science academies and internationa l scientific groups such as ICSU and its Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment, with spec ial programmes such as the newly inaugurated International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (see Chapter 10 ); the Man and the Biosphere Programme of UNESCO; quasi-governmental bodies such as IUCN; and certain industry groups and NGOs are active in thi s field. But, again, there is no recognized internati onal non-governmental centre of leadership through which the efforts of these groups can be focused and coordina ted. 60. During the 1970s, the growing capacity of compu ters led various governments, institutes, and inter national bodies to develop models for integrated policy anal ysis. They have provided significant insights and o ffer great promise as a means of anticipating the consequences of interdependent trends and of establishing the p olicy options to address them. /22 Without suggesting any relationship between them, early attempts were all limited by serious inconsistencies in the methods and assum ptions employed by the various sources on which the y depended for data and information. /23 Although significant improvements have been made i n the capability of models and other techniques, the data base remains weak. /24 61. There is an urgent need to strengthen and focus the capacities of these and other bodies to comple ment and support UNEP's monitoring and assessment functi ons by providing timely, objective, and authoritati ve assessments and public reports on critical threats and risks to the world community. To meet this need , we recommend the establishment of a Global Risks Asses sment Programme: to identify critical threats to the survival, secu rity, or well-being of all or a majority of people, globally or regionally; to assess the causes and likely human, economic, a nd ecological consequences of those threats, and to report regularly and publicly on their findings; to provide authoritative advice and proposals on w hat should or must be done to avoid, reduce, or, if possible, adapt to those threats; and to provide an additional source of advice and supp ort to governments and intergovernmental organizations for the implementation of programmes and policies designed to address such threats. 62. The Global Risk Assessment Programme would not requite the creation of a new international institu tion as such, as it should function primarily as a mechanis m for cooperation among largely non-governmental na tional and international organizations, scientific bodies, and industry groups. To provide intellectual leade rship and guide the programme, there should be a steering gro up composed of eminent individuals who together wou ld reflect a broad cross-section of the major areas of knowledge, vocations, and regions of the world, as well as the major bodies active in the field. 63. The steering group would serve as the focal poi nt for identifying the risks to be addressed by the programme, agreeing on the research needed to asses s those risks, and coordinating the work among the various participating bodies. It could form special consortia and task forces made up of experts from these bodies and it would also establish special expert a nd advisory groups consisting of world-known author ities in United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. specialized areas of science, economics, and law. T he steering group would be responsible for the over all evaluation of results, for their wide dissemination , and for follow-up activities. 64. The steering group would also be charged with h elping mobilize funds for implementing the programm e through contributions by the Environment Fund of UN EP, states, foundations, and other private sources. Funding would principally be for the purpose of fin ancing the various activities that would be carried out by other organizations as part of the programme, with only a small portion required to meet the costs of the steering group. 4. Making Informed Choices 65. As is evident from this report, the transition to sustainable development will require a range of public policy choices that are inherently complex and politically difficult. Reversing unsustainable development pol icies at the national and international level will require immen se efforts to inform the public and secure its supp ort. The scientific community, private and community groups, and NGOs can play a central role in this. If the NGO community is to translate its commitment to sustainable development into effective action, we will need to see a matching level of commitment from the governmental and intergovernmental communities, in genuine partnership with NGOs. The success and cost -effectiveness of NGO action is to an important deg ree a function of their spontaneity and freedom of action . Both among NGOs and amongst governments, we must fi nd ways to engender a new period of international cooperation. The urgency of our tasks no longer per mits us to spill our energies in fruitless and dest ructive conflict. Whilst we fight our wars of ideology on t he face of this planet, we are losing our productiv e relationship with the planet itself. David Bull Environmental Liaison Centre WCED Public Hearing Nairobi, 23 Sept 1986 4.1 Increase the Role of the Scientific Community a nd Non-Governmental Organizations 66. Scientific groups and NGOs have played - with t he help of young people /25 - a major part in the environmental movement from its earliest beginnings . Scientists were the first to point out evidence o f significant environmental risks and changes resulti ng from the growing intensity of human activities. Other non- governmental organizations and citizens' groups pio neered in the creation of public awareness and poli tical pressures that stimulated governments to act. Scien tific and non-governmental communities played a vit al role in the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm ./26 67. These groups have also played an indispensable role since the Stockholm Conference in identifying risks, in assessing environmental impacts and designing an d implementing measures to deal with them, and in maintaining the high degree of public and political interest required as a basis for action. Today, ma jor national 'State of the Environment' reports are being publis hed by some NGOs (in Malaysia, India, and the Unite d States, for instance). /27 Several international NGOs have produced significa nt reports on the status of and prospects for the global environment and natural re sources. /28 68. The vast majority of these bodies are national or local in nature, and a successful transition to sustainable development will require substantial strengthening of their capacities. To an increasing extent, natio nal NGOs draw strength from association with their counterpa rts in other countries and from participation in in ternational programmes and consultations. NGOs in developing co untries are particularly in need of international s upport - professional and moral as well as financial - to ca rry out their roles effectively. 69. Many international bodies and coalitions of NGO s are now in place and active. They play an importa nt part in ensuring that national NGOs and scientific bodie s have access to the support they require. These in clude regional groups providing networks linking together environment and development NGOs in Asia, Africa, Eastern and Western Europe, and North and South Ame rica. They also include a number of regional and gl obal coalitions on critical issues such as pesticides, c hemicals, rain, seeds, genetic resources, and devel opment United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. assistance. A global network for information exchan ge and joint action is provided through the Environ ment Liaison Centre (ELC) in Nairobi. ELC has over 230 N GO member groups, with the majority from developing countries, and is in contact with 7,000 others. 70. Only a few international NGOs deal on a broad b asis with both environment and development issues, but this is changing rapidly. One of them, the Internat ional Institute for Environment and Development, ha s long specialized in these issues and pioneered the conce ptual basis for the environment/development relatio nship. Most of them work with and support related organiza tions in the developing world. They facilitate thei r participation in international activities and their links with counterparts in the international commu nity. They provide instruments for leadership and cooperation among a wide variety of organizations in their resp ective constituencies. These capabilities will be ever mor e important in the future. An increasing number of environment and development issues could not be tac kled without them. 71. NGOs should give a high priority to the continu ation of their present networking on development cooperation projects and programmes, directed at th e improvement of the performance of NGO bilateral a nd multilateral development programmes. They could inc rease their efforts to share resources, exchange sk ills, and strengthen each other's capacities through grea ter international cooperation in this area. In sett ing their own house in order, 'environment' NGOs should assis t 'development' NGOs in reorienting projects that d egrade the environment and in formulating projects that co ntribute to sustainable development. The experience gained would provide a useful basis for continuing discuss ions with bilateral and multilateral agencies as to steps that these agencies might take to improve their performa nce. 72. In many countries, governments need to recogniz e and extend NGOs' right to know and have access to information on the environment and natural resource s; their right to be consulted and to participate i n decision making on activities likely to have a significant e ffect on their environment; and their right to lega l remedies and redress when their health or environment has been o r may be seriously affected. 73. NGOs and private and community groups can often provide an efficient and effective alternative to public agencies in the delivery of programmes and projects . Moreover, they can sometimes reach target groups that public agencies cannot. Bilateral and multilateral development assistance agencies, especially UNDP an d the World Bank, should draw upon NGOs in executing prog rammes and projects. At the national level, governments, foundations, and industry should also greatly extend their cooperation with NGOs in plann ing, monitoring, and evaluating as well as in carrying o ut projects when they can provide the necessary cap abilities on a cost-effective basis. To this end, governments should establish or strengthen procedures for offi cial consultation and more meaningful participation by N GOs in all relevant intergovernmental organizations . 74. International NGOs need substantially increased financial support to expand their special roles an d functions on behalf of the world community and in s upport of national NGOs. In the Commission's view, the increased support that will allow these organizatio ns to expand their services represents an indispens able and cost-effective investment. The Commission recommend s that these organizations be accorded high priorit y by governments, foundations, and other private and pub lic sources of funding. 4.2 Increase Cooperation with Industry 75. Industry is on the leading edge of the interfac e between people and the environment. It is perhaps the main instrument of change that affects the environmental resource bases of development, both positively and negatively. (See Chapter 8 .) Both industry and government, therefore, stand t o benefit from working together more closely. 76. World industry has taken some significant steps through voluntary guidelines concerning industry p ractices on environment, natural resources, science, and tec hnology. Although few of these guidelines have been extended to or applied regionally in Africa, Asia, or Latin America, industry continues to address the se issues through various international associations. 77. These efforts were advanced significantly by th e 1984 World Industry Conference on Environmental Management (WICEM). /29 Recently, as a follow-up to WICEM, several major c orporations from a number of developed countries formed the International Enviro nment Bureau to assist developing countries with th eir United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. environment/development needs. Such initiatives are promising and should be encouraged. Cooperation between governments and industry would be further f acilitated if they established joint advisory counc ils for sustainable development - for mutual advice, assist ance, and cooperation in helping to shape and imple ment policy, laws, and regulations for more sustainable forms of development. Internationally, governments in cooperation with industry, and NGOs should work thr ough appropriate regional organizations to develop basic codes of conduct for sustainable development, drawi ng on and extending relevant existing voluntary cod es, especially in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. 78. The private sector also has a major impact on d evelopment through commercial bank loans from withi n and outside countries. In 1983, for example, the propor tion of the total net receipts of developing countr ies from private sources, mostly in the form of commercial b ank loans, was greater than all ODA that year. Sinc e 1963, as indebtedness worsened, commercial bank lending t o developing countries has declined. /30 79. Efforts are being made to stimulate private inv estment. These efforts should be geared to supporti ng sustainable development. The industrial and financi al corporations making such investments, and the ex port credit, investment insurance, and other programmes that facilitate them, should incorporate sustainabl e development criteria into their policies. 5. Providing the Legal Means 80. National and international law has traditionall y lagged behind events. Today, legal regimes are be ing rapidly outdistanced by the accelerating pace and expanding scale of impacts on the environmental base of development. Human laws must be reformulated to kee p human activities in harmony with the unchanging a nd universal laws of nature. There is an urgent need; to recognize and respect the reciprocal rights and responsibilities of individuals and states regardi ng sustainable development, to establish and apply new norms for state and int erstate behaviour to achieve sustainable developmen t, to strengthen and extend the application of existi ng laws and international agreements in support of sustainable development, and to reinforce existing methods and develop new proc edures for avoiding and resolving environmental disputes. 5.1 Recognizing Rights and Responsibilities 81. Principle 1 of the 1972 Stockholm Declaration said that 'Man has the fundamental right to freedo m, equality and adequate conditions of life, in an environment of a quality that permits a life of dignity and wel l-being'. /31 It further proclaimed the solemn responsibility of gov ernments to protect and improve the environment for both present and future generations. After the Stockholm Conference, several states recognized in their Constitutions or laws the right to an adequate envi ronment and the obligation of the state to protect that environment. 82. Recognition by states of their responsibility t o ensure an adequate environment for present as wel l as future generations is an important step towards sustainabl e development. However, progress will also be facil itated by recognition of, for example, the right of individua ls to know and have access to current information o n the state of the environment and natural resources, the right to be consulted and to participate in decision mak ing on activities likely to have a significant effect on t he environment, and the right to legal remedies and redress for those whose health or environment has been or may b e seriously affected. What are we to do? It is axiomatic that we as indiv iduals or groups of individuals share territory in resources. We need to define common norms of behaviour. This i s true whether we are speaking of a family, small t own, a province or country, or the world community. Howeve r, the definition of common norms of behaviour is n ot in itself sufficient for the creation of a body of rul es and regulation. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. To operate effectively, certain basic conditions mu st be fulfilled: the existence of a general will am ong members of the community to accept and adhere to regulation s; the existence of a political framework not only for defining and quantifying common behaviour or norms, but also for adopting existing rules to change wit hin the community; a means of determining compliance with i nternational rules and regulations; and, finally, t he means for enforcement. Fergus Watt World Association of World Federalists WCED Public Hearing Ottawa, 26-27 May 1986 83. The enjoyment of any right requires respect for the similar rights of others, and recognition of r eciprocal and even joint responsibilities. States have a responsi bility towards their own citizens and other states: to maintain ecosystems and related ecological proc esses essential for the functioning of the biospher e; to maintain biological diversity by ensuring the s urvival and promoting the conservation in their nat ural habitats of all species of flora and fauna; to observe the principle of optimum sustainable yi eld in the exploitation of living natural resources and ecosystems; to prevent or abate significant environmental poll ution or harm; to establish adequate environmental protection sta ndards; to undertake or require prior assessments to ensur e that major new policies, projects, and technologi es contribute to sustainable development; and to make all relevant information public without de lay in all cases of harmful or potentially harmful releases of pollutants, especially radioactive releases. 84. It is recommended that governments take appropr iate steps to recognize these reciprocal rights and responsibilities. /32 However, the wide variation in national legal syst ems and practices makes it impossible to propose an approach that would be valid everywhere. Some countries have amended their basic laws or constitution; others are considering the a 'option of a special national law or charter setting out th e rights and responsibilities of citizens and the state regardin g environmental protection and sustainable developm ent Others may wish to consider the designation of a na tional council or public representative or 'ombudsm an' to represent the interests and rights of present and f uture generations and act as an environmental watch dog, alerting governments and citizens to any emerging t hreats. 5.2 A Universal Declaration and a Convention on Env ironmental Protection and Sustainable Development 85. Building on the 1972 Stockholm Declaration , the 1982 Nairobi Declaration , and many existing international conventions and General Assembly resolutions, there is now a need to consolidate and extend relevant l egal principles in a new charter to guide state behaviou r in the transition to sustainable development. It would provide the basis for, and be subsequently expanded into, a Convention, setting out the sovereign righ ts and reciprocal responsibilities of all states on enviro nmental protection and sustainable development. The charter should prescribe new norms for state and interstate behaviour needed to maintain livelihoods and life on our shared planet, including basic norms for prior noti fication, consultation, and assessment of activitie s likely to have an impact on neighbouring states or global com mons. These could include the obligation to alert a nd inform neighbouring states in the event of an accid ent likely to have a harmful impact on their enviro nment. Although a few such norms have evolved in some bila teral and regional arrangements, the lack of wider agreement on such basic rules for interstate behavi our undermines both the sovereignty and economic development potential of each and all states. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 86. We recommend that the General Assembly commit i tself to preparing a universal Declaration and late r a Convention on environmental protection and sustaina ble development. A special negotiating group could be established to draft a Declaration text for adoptio n in 1986. Once it is approved, that group could th en proceed to prepare a Convention, based on and extending the principles in the Declaration, with the aim of hav ing an agreed Convention text ready for signature by state s within three to five years. To facilitate the ear ly launching of that process the Commission has submitted for co nsideration by the General Assembly, and as a start ing point for the deliberations of the special negotiat ing group, a number of proposed legal principles em bodied in 22 Articles which were prepared by its group of int ernational legal experts. These proposed principles are submitted to assist the General Assembly in its del iberations and have not been approved or considered in detail by the Commission. A summary of the principl es and Articles appears as Annexe 1 of this report. 5.3 Strengthen and Extend Existing International Co nventions and Agreements 87. In parallel, governments should accelerate thei r efforts to strengthen and extend existing and mor e specific international conventions and cooperative arrangeme nts by: acceding to or ratifying existing global and regio nal conventions dealing with environment and development, and applying them with more vigour and rigour; reviewing and revising those relevant conventions that need to be brought in line with the latest ava ilable technical and scientific information; and negotiating new global and regional conventions or arrangements aimed at promoting cooperation and coordination in the field of environment and develo pment (including, for example, new conventions and agreements on climate change, on hazardous chemical s and wastes, and on preserving biological diversity). Law does not stand alone. It depends on the functio ning of many things. Experience from the past 15 ye ars of development has taught us that there is a danger th at bureaucracy with all its strength coming from th e West, in Indonesia's case because of the oil and gas revenue s, will strangle the community with so many laws. T hey have, for instance, laws that ask every gathering o f five or more people to have permission from the p olice. Sometimes I feel that maybe the best government is the one who governs the least. In this case, I feel that sometimes the Asian countries learn from each other . Adi Sasono Institute for Development Studies WCED Public Hearing Jakarta, 26 March 1985 88. It is recommended that the UNEP secretariat, in close cooperation with the IUCN Environmental Law Centre, should help in these efforts. 5.4 Avoiding and Settling Environmental Disputes 89. Many disputes can be avoided or more readily re solved if the principles, rights, and responsibilit ies cited earlier are built into national and international l egal frameworks and are fully respected and impleme nted by many states. Individuals and states are more reluct ant to act in a way that might lead to a dispute wh en, as in many national legal systems, there is an establishe d and effective capacity as well as ultimately bind ing procedures for settling disputes. Such a capacity a nd procedures are largely lacking at the internatio nal level, particularly environmental and natural resource man agement issues. /33 90. it is recommended that public and private organ izations and NGOs help in this area by establishing special panels or rosters of experts with experience in var ious forms of dispute settlement and special compet ence on the legal and substantive aspects of environmental protection, natural resources management, and susta inable development. In addition, a consolidated inventory and referral system or network for responding to re quests for advice and assistance should be established in avoiding or receiving such disputes. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 91. To promote the peaceful and early settlement of international disputes on environmental and resour ce management problems, it is recommended that the fol lowing procedure be adopted. States should be given up to 18 months to reach mutual agreement on a solutio n or on a common dispute settlement arrangement. If agreement is not reached, then the dispute can be s ubmitted to conciliation at the request of any one of the concerned states and, if still unresolved, thereaft er to arbitration or judicial settlement. 92. This proposed new procedure raises the possibil ity of invoking a binding process of dispute settle ment at the request of any state. Binding settlement is not the preferred method for settling international di sputes. But such a provision is now needed not only as a last r esort to avoid prolonged disputes and possible seri ous environmental damage, but also to encourage and pro vide an incentive for all parties to reach agreemen t within a reasonable time on either a solution or a mutuall y agreed means, such as mediation. 93. The capabilities of the Permanent Court of Arbi tration and the International Court of Justice to d eal with environmental and resource management problems also should be strengthened. States should make greater use of the World Court's capacity under Article 26 of its Statute to form special chambers for dealing with particular cases or categories of cases, including environmental protection or resource management cas es. The Court has declared its willingness and readines s to deal with such cases fully and promptly. 6. Investing in Our Future 94. We have endeavoured to show that: it makes long -term economic sense to pursue environmentally soun d policies. But potentially very large financial outl ays will be needed in the short term in such fields as renewable energy development, pollution control equipment, an d integrated rural development. Developing countrie s will need massive assistance for this purpose, and more generally to reduce poverty. Responding to this fin ancial need will be a collective investment in the future 6.1 National Action 95. Past experience teaches us that these outlays w ould be good investments. By the late 1960s, when s ome industrial countries began to mount significant env ironmental protection programmes, they had already incurred heavy economic costs in the form of damage to human health, property, natural resources, and the environment. After 1970, in order to roll back some of this damage, they saw expenditures on environme ntal pollution measurer, alone rise from about 0.3 per c ent of GNP in 1970 to somewhere between 1.5 per cen t and, in some countries, 2.0 per cent around the end of t he decade. Assuming low levels of economic growth i n the future, these same countries will probably have to increase expenditures on environmental protection somewhere between 20 to 100 per cent just to mainta in current levels of environmental quality. /34 First, if the problems of environmental degradation and of poverty, particularly in the Third World, a re to be solved, a continued economic development is essenti al. Second, we must reconcile environmental protect ion with economic growth. There is a growing consensus that this is perfectly possible and desirable. Thir d, there is also a great consensus that the application of stri ct environmental standards is good for economic gro wth, as well as for the environment, and that they encourag e innovation, promote inventiveness and efficiency, and generate employment. Fourth, to achieve the goals o f sustainable development, good environment, and de cent standards of life for all involves very large chang es in attitude. Stanley Clinton-Davis Commissioner for Environment European Economic Comm unity WCED Public Hearing Oslo, 24-25 June 1985 96. These figures relate only to expenditures to co ntrol environmental pollution. Unfortunately, simil ar figures are not available on the level of expenditures made to rehabilitate lands and natural habitats, re-est ablish soil fertility, reforest areas, and undertake other meas ures to restore the resource base. But they would b e substantial. 97. Nations, industrial and developing, that did no t make these investments have paid much more in ter ms of damage costs to human health, property, natural res ources, and the environment. And these costs contin ue to rise at an accelerating pace. Indeed, countries tha t have not yet instituted strong programmes now fac e the United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. need for very large investments. Not only do they n eed to roll back the first generation of environmen tal damage, they also need to begin to catch up with th e rising incidence of future damage. If they do not , their fundamental capital assets, their environmental res ources, will continue to decline. 98. In strictly economic terms, the benefits of the se expenditures have been generally greater than th e costs in those countries that have made them. /35 Beyond that, however, many of these countries foun d that economic, regulatory, and other environmental measures could be applied in ways that would result in innovation by industry. And those companies that did respond inno vatively are today often in the forefront of their industry. They have developed new products, new processes, an d entire plants that use less water, energy, and ot her resources per unit of output and are hence more eco nomic and competitive. 99. Nations that begin to reorient major economic a nd sectoral policies along the lines proposed in th is report can avoid much higher future levels of spending on environmental restoration and curative measures and also enhance their future economic prospects. By making central and sectoral agencies directly responsible for maintaining and enhancing environmental and resourc e stocks, expenditures for environmental protection and resource management would gradually be built into t he budgets of those agencies for measures to preven t damage. The unavoidable costs of environmental and resource management would thus be paid only once. We must have a true participation of all of the soc iety in the decision-making and More particularly i n the allocation of resources. And why so? because all of us are perfectly aware that there will never be su fficient resources for everything that we wish, but if the p opulation participates in the decision making it wi ll benefit those who need the most and it will express their t hought about the allocation of resources and it wil l give us the certainty that that which is bring done is the legitimate aspiration of the people. Aristides Marquee National Council for Urban Development WCED Public Hearing Brasilia, 30 Oct 1985 6.2 International Action 100. Developing countries, as noted earlier, need a significant increase in financial support from int ernational sources for environmental restoration, protection, and improvement and to help them through the necess ary transition to sustainable development. 101. At the global level, there is an extensive ins titutional capacity to channel this support. This c onsists of the United Nations and its specialized agencies: the mu ltilateral development banks, notably the World Ban k; other multilateral development cooperation organizations, such as those of the European Economic Community; national development assistance agencies, most of w hom cooperate within the framework of the Developme nt Assistance Committee of OECD or of OPEC; and other international groups, such as the Consultative Grou p on International Agricultural Research, that play a n important role and influence on the quality and n ature of development assistance. Together, the development o rganizations and agencies are responsible for the transfer of about $35 billion of ODA annually to de veloping countries. In addition, they are the sourc e of most technical assistance and policy advice and support to developing countries. 102. These organizations and agencies are the princ ipal instruments through which the development partnership between industrial and developing count ries operates and, collectively, their influence is substantial and pervasive. It is imperative that they play a le ading role in helping developing countries make the transition to sustainable development. Indeed, it is difficult to envisage developing countries making this trans ition in an effective and timely manner without their full comm itment and support. 6.2.1 Reorienting Multilateral Financial Institutio ns 103. The World Bank, IMF, and Regional Development Banks warrant special attention because of their ma jor influence on economic development throughout the wo rld. As indicated in Chapter 3 , there is an urgent need for much larger flows of concessional and non-conce ssional finance through the multilateral agencies. The role of the World Bank is especially important in this r espect, both as the largest single source of develo pment lending and for its policy leadership, which exerts a significant influence on both developing countri es and United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. donors. The World Bank has taken a significant lead in reorienting its lending programmes to a much hi gher sensitivity to environmental concerns and to suppor t for sustainable development. This is a promising beginning. But it will not be enough unless and unt il it is accompanied by a fundamental commitment to sustainable development by the World Bank and the t ransformation of its internal structure and process es so as to ensure its capacity to carry this out. The sa me is true of other multilateral development banks and agencies. 104. The IMF also exerts a major influence on the d evelopment policies of developing countries and, as described in Chapter 3 , there is deep concern in many countries that the conditions that accompany its lending are undermining sustainable development. It is ther efore essential that the IMF, too, incorporate sust ainable development objectives and criteria into its polici es and programmes. 105. Several countries have already formally instru cted their representatives on the Board of the Worl d Bank to ensure that the environmental impacts of projects p roposed for approval have been assessed and adequat ely taken into account. We recommend that other governm ents take similar action, not only with regard to t he World Bank but also in the Regional Banks and the o ther institutions. In this way they can support the ongoing efforts within the Banks and other institutions to reorient and refocus their mandates, programmes, an d budgets to support sustainable development. The transition to sustainable development by the development assis tance agencies and the IMF would be facilitated by the es tablishment of a high-level office in each agency w ith the authority and resources to ensure that all policies , projects, and loan conditions support sustainable development, and to prepare and publish annual asse ssments and reports on progress made and needed. A first step is to develop simple methodologies for s uch assessments, recognizing that they are at prese nt experimental and need further work. 106. In making these changes, the multilateral fina ncial institutions fortunately have some base on wh ich to build. In 1980, they endorsed a Declaration of Envi ronmental Policies and Procedures Relating to Econo mic Development. Since then they have been meeting and consulting through the Committee of International Development Institutions on the Environment (CIDIE) . /36 Some have articulated clear policies and project guidelines for incorporating environmental concerns and assessments into their planning and decision m aking, but only a few have assigned staff and resources to implementing them, notably the World Bank, which i s now considering even further institutional changes to s trengthen this work. Overall, as pointed out by the UNEP Executive Director in his statement reviewing the f irst five years of work. CIDIE has not yet truly su cceeded in getting environmental considerations firmly ingrain ed in development policies. \"There has been a disti nct lack of action by several multilaterals.\" CIDIE members have \"gone along with the Declaration in principle more than in major shifts in action.\" /37 107. In order to marshal and support investing its in conservation projects and national conservation strategies that enhance the resource base for development, ser ious consideration should be given to the developme nt of a special international banking programme or facili ty /38 linked to the World Bank. Such a special conservat ion banking programme or facility could provide leans a nd facilitate joint financing arrangements for the development and protection of critical habitats and ecosystems, including those of international signi ficance, supplementing efforts by bilateral aid agencies, mu ltilateral financial institutions, and commercial b anks. 106. In the framework of the Council of Mutual Econ omic Assistance (CMEA), there has been since the ea rly 1970s a Committee for Environmental Protection with the participation of the heads of appropriate organizations in the member states. This Committee coordinates the relevant research and development programmes and, in some cases, organizes technical assistance for the interested member states, involv ing the Investment Bank of CMEA. 6.2.2 Reorienting Bilateral Aid Agencies 109. Bilateral aid agencies presently provide nearl y four times as much total ODA as is provided by international organizations. As indicated in Chapter 3 , a new priority and focus in bilateral aid agencie s is needed in three main areas: new measures to ensure that all projects support s ustainable development; United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. special programmes to help restore, protect, and i mprove the ecological basis for development in many developing countries; and special programmes for strengthening the instituti onal and professional capacities needed for sustain able development. 110. Proposals for special bilateral aid programmes in the areas of agriculture, forestry, energy, ind ustry, human settlements, and genetic resources are made i n earlier chapters of this report. The first two pr iority areas in this chapter also contain proposals for st rengthening the institutional and professional capa cities in developing countries. The focus here is therefore o n the first area: new measures to ensure that all b ilateral aid projects support sustainable development. The problems of today do not come with a tag marked energy or economy or CO2 or demography, nor with a label indicating a country or a region. The problem s are multi-disciplinary and transnational or globa l. The problems are not primarily scientific and techn ological. In science we have the knowledge and in technology the tools. The problems are basically po litical, economic, and cultural. Per Lindblom International Federation of Institutes of Advanced Studies WCED Public Hearing Oslo, 24-25 June 1985 111. Over the past decade, bilateral aid agencies h ave gradually given more attention to the environme ntal dimensions of their programmes and projects. A 1980 survey of the environmental and practices of six m ajor bilateral aid agencies indicated that only one, USA ID, had systematic and enforceable procedures backe d by the staff resources necessary to carry them out. /39 Since then, others have made some progress on the policy level, increased funds for environmental projects, and produced guidelines or checklists to guide thei r programmes. However, a 1983 study of those guidelin es concluded that there was little evidence of thei r systematic application. /40 112. An important step towards concerted action was taken in 1986 with the adoption by OECD of a recommendation to member governments to include an environmental assessment policy and effective procedures for applying it in their bilateral aid p rogrammes. /41 It is based on a detailed analysis and studies carried out by a joint group of governmental expert s from both the Development Assistance Committee an d the Environmental Committee. /42 The recommendation includes proposals for adequate staff and financial resources to undertake environmental assessments an d a central office in each agency to supervise implementation and to assist developing countries w ishing to improve their capacities for conducting environmental assessments. We urge all bilateral ai d agencies to implement this recommendation as quic kly as possible, it is essential, of course, that this sho uld not reduce aid flows in the aggregate or slow d isbursements or represent a new form of aid conditionality. 6.2.3 New Sources of Revenue and Automatic Financin g 113. We have made a series of proposals for institu tional change within and among the organizations an d specialized agencies of the UN system in the sectio ns on 'Getting at the Sources' and 'Dealing with th e Effects'. Most of those changes will not require additional f inancial resources but can be achieved through a reorientation of existing mandates, programmes, and budgets and a redeployment of present staff. Once implemented, those measures will make a major diffe rence in the effective use of existing resources in making the transition to sustainable development. 114. Nevertheless, there is also a need to increase the financial resources for new multilateral effor ts and programmes of action for environmental protection a nd sustainable development. These new funds will no t be easy to come by if the international organizations through which they flow have to continue to rely so lely on traditional sources of financing: assessed contribu tions from governments, voluntary contributions by governments, and funds borrowed in capital markets by the World Bank and other international financial institutions. United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. 115. Assessed contributions from governments have t raditionally been used largely for the administrati ve and operating costs of international organizations; the y are not intended for multilateral assistance. The total assessed contributions from governments are much sm aller than the amount provided through voluntary contributions and the prospects of raising signific ant, additional funds through assessed contribution s are limited. 116. Voluntary contributions by governments give th e overall revenue system some flexibility, but they cannot be adjusted readily to meet new or increased requir ements. Being voluntary, the flow of these funds is entirely discretionary and unpredictable. The commitments ar e also extremely short-term, as pledges are normall y made only one or two years in advance. Consequently , they provide little security or basis for effecti ve planning and management of international actions requiring s ustained, longer-term efforts. Most of the limited funds provided so far for international environmental act ion have come through voluntary contributions, chan nelled principally through UNEP and NGOs. 117. Given the current constraints on major sources and modes of funding, it is necessary to consider new approaches as well as new sources of revenue for fi nancing international action in support of sustaina ble development. The Commission recognizes that such pr oposals may not appear politically realistic at thi s point in time. It believes, however, that - given the tre nds discussed in this report - the need to support sustainable development will become so imperative that politica l realism will come to require it. 118. The search for other, and especially more auto matic, sources and means for financing internationa l action goes almost as far back as the UN itself. It was no t until 1977, however, when the Plan of Action to C ombat Desertification was approved by the UN General Asse mbly that governments officially accepted, but neve r implemented, the principle of automatic transfers. That Plan called for the establishment of a special account that could draw resources not only from traditional sources but also from additional measures of finan cing, 'including fiscal measures entailing automaticity'. /43 119. Since then, a series of studies and reports /44 have identified and examined a growing list of new sources of potential revenue, including: revenue from the use of international commons (fro m ocean fishing and transportation, from sea-bed mining, from Antarctic resources, or from parking c harges for geostationary communications satellites, for example; taxes on international trade (such as a general tr ade tax; taxes on specific traded commodities, on invisible exports, or on surpluses in balance of tr ade; or a consumption tax on luxury goods); and international financial measures (a link between s pecial drawing rights and development finance, for example, or IMF gold reserves and sales). 120. In its 1980 report, the Brandt Commission call ed for raising additional funds from more automatic sources such as those cited above. In its follow-up report in 1983, the Brandt Commission strongly urged that these most 'futuristic' of all the Report's proposals not be lost completely from view. /45 Nevertheless, they again rank below the short term horizon of the international a genda. 121. The World Commission on Environment and Develo pment was specifically given the mandate by the UN General Assembly to look once again beyond that lim ited horizon. We have done so and, given the compel ling nature, pace, and scope of the different transition s affecting our economic and ecological systems as described in this report, we consider that at least some of t hose proposals for additional and more automatic so urces of revenue are fast becoming less futuristic and more necessary. This Commission particularly considers t hat the proposals regarding revenue from the use of interna tional commons and natural resources now warrant an d should receive serious consideration by governments and the General Assembly. III. A Call for Action 122. Over the course of this century, the relations hip between the human world and the planet that sus tains it has undergone a profound change. When the century b egan, neither human numbers nor technology had the power to radically alter planetary systems. As the century closes, not only do vastly increased human numbers United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. and their activities have that power, but major, un intended changes are occurring in the atmosphere, i n soils, in waters, among plants and animals, and in the relati onships among all of these. The rate of change is outstripping the ability of scientific disciplines and our current capabilities to assess and advise. It is frustrating the attempts of political and economic institutions , which evolved in a different, more fragmented wor ld, to adapt and cope. It deeply worries many people who a re seeking ways to place those concerns on the poli tical agendas. 123. We have been careful to base our recommendatio ns on the realities of present institutions, on wha t can and must be accomplished today. But to keep options open for future generations, the present generatio n must begin now, and begin together, nationally and inter nationally. 124. To achieve the needed change in attitudes and reorientation of policies and institutions, the Com mission believes that an active follow-up of this report is imperative. It is with this in mind that we call f or the UN General Assembly, upon due consideration, to transf orm this report into a UN Programme of Action on Sustainable Development. Special follow-up conferen ces could be initiated at the regional level. Withi n an appropriate period after the presentation of the re port to the General Assembly, an international Conf erence could be convened to review progress made and promo te follow-up arrangements that will be needed over time to set benchmarks and to maintain human progress wi thin the guidelines of human needs and natural laws . 125. The Commissioners came from 21 very different nations. In our discussions, we disagreed often on details and priorities. But despite our widely differing ba ckgrounds and varying national and international responsibilities, we were able to agree to the line s along which institutional change must be drawn. 126. We are unanimous in our conviction that the se curity, well-being, and very survival of the planet depend on such changes, now.

The World Commission on Environment and Development was created as a consequence of General Assembly resolution 38/161 adopted at the 38th Session of the United Nations in the fall of 1983. That resolution called upon the Secretary General to app oint the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Commissi on rind in turn directed them to jointly appoint the r emaining members, at least half of whom were to be selected from the developing world. The Secretary General ap pointed Mrs. Gro Harlem Brundtland of Norway, then leader of the Norwegian Labour Party, as Chairman a nd Dr. Mansour Khalid, the former Minister of Forei gn Affairs from Sudan, as Vice-Chairman. They together appointed the remaining members of the Commission. The Commission has functioned as an independent bod y. All its members have served the Commission in th eir individual capacities, not as representatives of th eir governments. The Commission has thus been able to address any issues, to solicit any advice, and to f ormulate and present any proposals and recommendati ons that it considered pertinent and relevant. In pursuing its mandate, the commission has paid ca reful attention to the Terms of Reference suggested by the General Assembly in Resolution 38/161 and has operated in close collaboration with the I ntergovernmental Inter-sessional Preparatory Committee of the Govern ing Council of the UN Environment Programme, which has itself been preparing an intergovernmental report o n environmental perspectives to the year 2000 and b eyond. After the Commission's report has been discussed by UNEP's Governing Council, it is to be submitted to the General Assembly of the United Nations for its cons ideration during its 42nd Session in the fall of 19 87.

The Commission's Mandate The Commission's Mandate, officially adopted at its Inaugural Meeting in Geneva on 1-3 October 1984, s tates: The World Commission on Environment and Development has been established at a time of unprecedented growth in pressures on the global environment, with grave predictions about the human future becoming commonplace. The Commission is confident that it is possible to build a future that is more prosperous, more just, and more secure because it rests on policies and practices t hat serve to expand and sustain the ecological basi s of development. The Commission is convinced, however, that this wil l no happen without significant changes in current approaches: changes in perspectives, attitudes and life styles; changes in certain critical policies a nd the ways in which they are formulated and applied; changes i n the nature of cooperation between governments, business, science, and people; changes in certain f orms of international cooperation which have proved incapable of tackling many environment and developm ent issues; changes, above all, in the level of understanding and commitment by people, organizatio ns and governments. The World Commission on Environment and Development therefore invites suggestions, participation, and support in order to assist it urgently: 1. to re-examine the critical issues of environment and development and to formulate innovative, concr ete, and realistic action proposals to deal with them; 2. to strengthen international cooperation on envir onment and development and to assess and propose ne w forms of cooperation that can break out of existing patterns and influence policies and events in the direction of needed change; and 3. to raise the level of understanding and commitme nt to action on the part of individuals, voluntary organizations, businesses, institutes, and governme nts. The Commission solicits the views of those individu als, scientific institutes, non-governmental organi zations, specialized agencies, and other bodies of the Unite d Nations, and national governments concerned with environment and development issues. It requests the ir support and it will facilitate their participati on in the work of the Commission. It wishes especially to hear the views of youth. In fulfilling its tasks, the Commission will pay ca reful attention to the Terms of Reference suggested by the General Assembly of the United Nations in resolution 38/161 , in which the General Assembly welcomed the establishment of the Commission.

The Commission's Work In May of 1984, an Organizational Meeting of the Co mmission was held in Geneva to adopt its rules of procedure and operation and to appoint a Secretary General to guide its work. In July of 1964, a Secre tariat was established in Geneva, temporarily at the Centr e de Morillon and later at the Palais Wilson. Members of the Secretariat Members of the Secretariat have included: Secretary General: Jim MacNeill Senior Professional Staff: Nitin Desai, Senior Economic Advisor Vitus Fernando, Senior Programme Officer Branislav Gosovic, Senior Programme Officer Marie-Madeleine Jacquemier, Finance and Administrat ive Officer Kazu Kato, Director of Programmes Warren H.

Jelka de Shane Vanderwert Inaugural Meeting & Workplan The Commission held its first official meeting in G eneva on 1-3 October 1984. During that meeting, the Commission agreed upon its Mandate, the key issues it would address in the course of its deliberations , the strategy it would employ to achieve its objectives, and the workplan and timetable that would be used to guide its work. Immediately following that meeting, the C ommission publicly released its principal working d ocument, 'Mandate for Change'. At its Inaugural Meeting, the Commission selected e ight key issues for analysis during the course of i ts work: Perspectives on Population, Environment, and Susta Environment and Development; Industry: Environment and Food Security, Agriculture, Forestry, Environment, and Development; Human Settlements: Environment and Development; International Economic Relations, Environment, and Development; Decision Support Systems for Environmental Managem ent; and International Cooperation. It agreed that it would examine these issues from t he perspective of the year 2000 and beyond and from the perspective of their common sources in economic, so cial, and sectoral policies. At its Inaugural Meeting, the Commission also decid ed that its processes would be open, visible, and participatory and that in conducting its work, stra tegies would be employed to ensure it of receiving the broadest range of views and advice on the key issue s it was addressing. Public Hearings The Commission therefore decided that it would hold deliberative meetings in all regions of the world and that it would take the occasion of those meetings to get a first hand view of environment and development issu es in United Nations UN Documents: Gathering a Body of Global Agreements has been compiled by the NGO Committee on Education of the Conference of NGOs from United Nations web sites with the invaluable help of information & communications technology. those regions. It also decided to use these visits to hold open Public Hearings where senior governmen t representatives, scientists and experts, research i nstitutes, industrialists, representatives of non-g overnmental organizations, and the general public could openly express their concerns to the Commission and submit their views and advice on issues of common concern. These Public Hearings, which are a unique feature o f the Commission, have become its 'trademark', demonstrating both to the Commissioners and the par ticipants that the issues addressed by the Commissi on are indeed of global concern and do transcend natio nal boundaries and disparate cultures. Hundreds of organizations and individuals gave testimony during the Public Hearings and over 800 written submissio ns constituting more than 10,000 pages of material wer e received by the Commission in connection with the m. The Public Hearings have been of immeasurable benef it to the Commissioners and the Secretariat, and th e gratitude of the Commission is extended to all who contributed to their success. Deliberative meetings, site visits, and/or Public H earings of the Commission were held in Jakarta, Ind onesia, 27-31 March 1985: Oslo, Norway, 21-28 June 1985; Sa o Paulo and Brasilia, Brazil, 25 October-4 November 1985; Vancouver, Edmonton, Toronto, Ottawa, Halifax , and quebec City, Canada, 21-31 May 1986; Harare, Zimbabwe, 15-19 September, Nairobi, Kenya, 20-23 Se ptember 1986; Moscow, USSR, 6-12 December 1986; and Tokyo, Japan, 23-28 February 1987. Special work ing group meetings of the Commission were also held in Geneva, Moscow, and Berlin (West). Expert Special Advisors To further widen its base of information and advice , the Commission appointed a group of expert Specia l Advisors to assist it and the Secretariat in the an alysis of the key issues. These included Edward S. Ayensu on Food Security and Forestry, Gamani Corea on Interna tional Economic Relations, Gordon T. Goodman on Energy. Ashok Khosla on Decision Support Systems fo r Environmental Management, Robert D. Munro on International Cooperation and Legal Regimes, Michae l Royston on Industry, Johan Jorgen Hoist on Environment and Security, and Guy-Olivier Segond on Youth. The Chairman was also advised by Hans Christian Bugge and Morten Wetland. Later in its wo rk, the Commission appointed Lloyd Timberlake as Sp ecial Editorial Advisor. To assist it in its work in three of the key issue areas - Energy, Industry, and Food Security - the C ommission constituted Advisory Panels of leading experts to a dvise it on the recommendations and conclusions it should consider making.
