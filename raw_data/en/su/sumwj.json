Montaigne Essays Medical education, while the stuff of endless academic debate, is hardly the meat of the tabloids. Yet media interest in Papua New Guinea has focussed upon criticism of thepresent medical course \u2014 one devoted to problem based learning (PBL), which replacedthe traditional model in our medical school in 2000. In an angry correspondence, critics ofPBL have suggested that the doctors trained in the new tradition are worse trained and lesscompetent than their peers across the world. More to the point, they are not as good doctorsas those trained in 'the old dispensation' pre-2000. There seems to be a great deal of opinion, but little evidence. It seems that medical education with its enthusiasts and detractors is a matter more for belief than for scientificinquiry. The BMJ in September 2002 tried to ask its readers to define 'a good doctor' and there was no real agreement despite passionate debate. If we are uncertain about theproduct of medical education it is difficult to be precise about 'how we best make doctors'. Medical education has arrived. There are training courses, university departments, Master's degrees, journals of medical education ... all devoted to the subject. In the wake of all thisenthusiasm has come change \u2014 the new syllabus has reduced teaching of anatomy and hastaken on behavioural sciences, environmental science, ethics and law; the pre-clinical andclinical disciplines have been integrated and are taught side by side; there is an emphasis onlifelong learning and the new information age in extracting evidence from the internet;there is interactive computer teaching and learning programmes. It all seems broadlysensible, consistent and modern. It is very difficult to get hard evidence, at the level of doctor performance, after receiving any particular model of medical education. Ten years after qualifying it is impossible to tellhow or where a doctor was trained. In principle you would need to do a sort ofFramingham study on doctors trained in different schools and follow performance over alifetime. But by the time the evidence came in, it would have all changed anyway formedical educators are great innovators and changers. People going into medical school in 2003 are among the most able in the country. The old gibe, 'people who cannot do maths do medicine', no longer applies. Competition is fierceand it seems likely that such gifted individuals would qualify almost regardless of how theywere educated. The general public and the GMC have a say too; the doctor has to have aminimum competence as a physician. He or she has to be 'safe' or perhaps 'good enough'which may mean being at least as good as 50% of one's peers 90% of the time. PBL was introduced in Papua New Guinea in 2000 across the whole 4 years of the School of Medicine (the student body numbers 200). The first, 'pure PBL graduates' complete in 2003.Other student cohorts had 1 or more years of the 'old curriculum' and the rest as PBL. Theyare sort of educational hybrids and seem none the worse. It has been a major effort andachievement in a country like this one \u2014 notoriously, 'the land of the unexpected', which isshorthand for 'there are more than the usual run of avoidable cock-ups'. Is it possible to tell the difference between a PBL doctor and a conventional doctor 10 years after qualifying? It seems likely that it is those first emotional and frightening years afterqualifying that have a greater effect upon the tyro practitioner. Importantly, medical education should be enjoyable and fun. The analogy of lighting a fire for life, which needs constant fuel (new data) and oxygen (time and energy) and the deadashes raked away, is a good one. The old model of filling the bucket with facts and a slowleakage for the rest of one's life was equating medicine with a craft rather than a growingscience, but it still works for much of our work. The best teachers, whatever their methods,have been enthusiasts, actors, dreamers and poets who could occasionally inspire andalways interest. Debate about PBL rumbles on. The McMaster medical student I met once in Africa summed it all up for me. 'You can get a baby by IVF or by sexual intercourse and mostpeople think the second a lot more fun!' PBL is more fun.

It isof course true that GPs typically handle theirown complaints and try to resolve theminformally, while some complaintsdepartments and in the past CHCs haveattempted to do likewise. However, suchapproaches are not always successful,whoever is involved, and it is useful to beable to call on PALS as intermediatebrokers. PALS are not intended as a way ofavoiding complaints procedures wherepatients wish to use these. Complaints aregenerally handled by a separate department,and advocacy services, such as ICAS,should support patients who do complainformally, not PALS. Of course, concerns about GPs themselves may be raised with PALS and this can be apoint of tension for GPs and PALS.However, it should be remembered thatsome patients previously took complaintsabout GPs directly to CHCs. But then,CHCs were independent, whereas PALS arepart of the PCTs within which GPs work.Not surprisingly, PALS has been regarded asyet another ingredient in the ever-increasingmixture of PCT surveillance andinterference to which GPs are subject. Furthermore, PALS are also tasked with feeding back to trust managers, so that thecollective experience of patients can be usedto bring about improvements in servicedelivery. This is likely to be more useful inchanging the practice of directly employedPCT staff than that of independentcontractors, such as GPs and dentists, andtheir teams. So does PALS have anything positive to offer GPs? Certainly, from researchcurrently being undertaken at CityUniversity, 2we know of examples where GPs have felt very supported by PALSofficers, who have been even-handed andconstructive in resolving patient concerns.GPs have been able to turn to PALS officersfor advice on how to handle particularsituations, such as help in drafting a letterresponding to a complex complaint. It isalso evident that PALS have been able tomake significant improvements to services.For example, one PALS received repeatedcomplaints about a PCT department thatappeared never to answer the phone. APALS officer, who spent a morning in thedepartment, discovered the limitations of thetelephone system in use, and discussedTHEgovernment is introducing a raft of new initiatives to increase patient andpublic involvement into the NHS in England (www.cppih.org). These includePatient Advice and Liaison Services(PALS), Patient and Public Involvement(PPI) Forums, and Independent Complaintsand Advocacy Services (ICAS). All theseare relatively new local services whichtogether replace Community HealthCouncils (CHCs), but not the complaintsdepartments and/or procedures whichalready exist in every NHS trust, primarycare trust (PCT) and each general practice.The large number of new acronymsindicates the complexity of the newarrangements. It is difficult to fault the broad intentions behind this strategy, which is designed bothto inform improvements to services andcustomer care, and to address the'democratic deficit' of the NHS (the largestpublic sector organisation in the country isnot locally accountable). One may, however,wonder about the motivations for such astrategy. 1Is this an attempt to turn patients into consumers, and health care into amarket? Or is it an attempt to legitimisehealthcare rationing by making members ofthe public share the responsibility? The complexity of these arrangements has led to a great deal of confusion andmisunderstandings about roles. Worryingly,the government shared suchmisunderstandings at the outset, when itchanged the name of PALS from 'PatientAdvocacy and Liaison Service' to 'Patient Advice and Liaison Service'. The change was made because it was pointed out duringconsultation that NHS employees could notoffer independent advocacy support to thosecomplaining against their own organisation. Every NHS Trust and PCT should by now have a PALS, although some trusts arestruggling to make funding available for anadequate level of service. The purpose ofPALS is to:\u007f offer information and advice about health and other services, \u007f help patients resolve concerns and dissatisfactions quickly, \u007f feed back to senior managers their learning about ways in which trustservices fail patients, in order to promoteculture change. With regard to the second of these, it is intended that PALS should supplementviewpoint 2 Can GPs and PALS be friends? References 1. Meyer J.

Once fully aware of the problem, the department usedPALS' support to apply successfully forfunds for a new system. Although GPs oftentry to act on behalf of their patients incorrecting process faults such as this, theydo not have the flexibility to take theapproach adopted by this PALS officer. Itcan also be of benefit that PALS officers arefellow employees of the PCT: staff may feelless defensive than if they were discussingproblems with outsiders. It is true that these examples are taken from a well-established PALS service, which isgenerously staffed and led by a complaintsmanager who for years has cultivated goodrelationships with GPs. Other PALS aremuch newer, and often have only one or twostaff, who struggle to create and sustaingood relationships with so many others: thePCT and its departments, the GPs and otherindependent contractors, such as dentistsand pharmacists, and community and patientgroups. In any case, as local PPI Forums and ICAS are set up in the latter part of 2003, the rolesof PPI organisations will become moreconfusing. Patients will inevitably approachthe most convenient source of help,particularly if local ICAS have a presence inthe 'high street', as CHCs did. Thus, the newarrangements are likely to be frustrating forpatients who have to be referred elsewhere,for PALS staff who will have to clarify thearrangements to patients, and for GPs andtheir teams who will need to relate to amultiplicity of staff in these new and variedorganisations. GPs and other primary care staff who are committed to responding positively topatient concerns will of course find a way ofmaking the new arrangements work. And wehave found plenty of evidence that PALSofficers themselves, while fully aware of thesize of the challenge, are enthusiasticallyfinding ways of working effectively. In time,custom and practice will solve some of theteething problems, or find 'work-arounds'.But it is a pity that the new initiativescurrently appear to be more a set of problemsto tackle than a set of arrangements tosupport and facilitate.

It was terminated prematurely when it showedan increase in cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. However, a study which examinedcoronary atheroma progression with and without HRT over 3.3 years found no difference(page 535), and HRT does not appear to increase risk of heart failure ( J Women' s Health 12: 341). But it certainly increases the risk of breast cancer, as shown by the observationalMillion Women Study ( Lancet 362: 419).

This prospective study shows that 'thombophilia screening' is a waste of time: the likelihood of recurrence after post-surgical VTE is zero over2 years, whereas following spontaneous VTE it is 19%.

The task? To put together a 'PDP' ready for my appraisal interview in 4 days' time. As ifI had nothing better to do on a Sundayafternoon. For some months now a jumbled collection of papers have resided in a folder quaintlylabelled 'Karen's PDP'. But what does PDPstand for? I had to double-check. Yes, itseems to be Personal Development Plan, solets proceed ... I have the PDP delegate workbook to assist me. I have a CD ROM but not the skills to setit up. I have a colleague's PDP alreadyscrutinized by the postgraduate tutor toperuse. And I have just returned from a2-day retreat in medical humanities. Thus, it is with a great feeling of satisfaction and smugness that I now place the majorityof the aforesaid bits of paper in the recyclingbin. PDPs, PUNS, DENS, Portfolios, the lotof them. I review the PDP of my colleagueDr de Quincey, an experienced, articulate,caring doctor. Four pages of reflectivewriting precede his 'PDP workbookdocument'. Here, he expresses feelings closeto his heart about the state of our professionbefore he prostitutes himself to complete thelittle boxes about 'Himps' and 'Audit' and'What do I do well?'. To think that theprofession has asked a man of hiscapabilities to demean himself in such a wayby answering these questions and called itpersonal development, in order to fulfil anexternally dreamt up requirement which isthe equivalent of throwing a slave to thelions, sticks in my throat like a piece of meatready to be regurgitated. And about to be regurgitated it is, because I will not do it. I will, and have, completed theappraisal document, which was thought-provoking and relevant. I will also collecttogether in a portfolio, evidence ofmeasurable activities in my professional life,which contribute to its development. But I will not attribute any of these to a heading of personal development. It strikesme that whoever dreams up these terms donot understand the meaning of the wordsthey use. Personal \u2014 adjective or noun, meaning 'one's own, individual' anddevelopment \u2014 noun, meaning 'gradual unfolding, growth. So personal development means surely the gradual unfolding of one's own self? Whathas 'Himp' or ' Audit' got to do with thisprocess I may ask? My eloquent colleaguespeaks of our work 'emotionally testing us'.Has the profession ever in the 19 years I havebeen a doctor offered me resources to copewith these demands? Is their idea of this theCounselling Service for Sick Doctors, thenumber of which lies embarrassingly hiddenon the inside cover of the BMJ? So, to need counselling you must be 'sick'. Really what this says is that you somehow letan emotional missile from your workpenetrate the armour plating built uppainstakingly at medical school. I believe as a doctor that I have a responsibility to my patients in severalareas. Many of these are covered in theappraisal document \u2014 probity, health \u2014and I look forward to having them furtherexplored in my appraisal interview. I wouldeven relish some form of assessment of myclinical competence that at present is notcovered! But to ask me what I think I am good at, and not good at, annoys me, and to tart the wholeprocess up and call it personal developmentenrages me. Personal development is concerned with the growth of the individual. As doctors we needresources to cope with the dilemmas andemotional traumas that our profession bringsto us on a day-to-day basis. I am fortunate tohave discovered medical humanities. For methis is a resource and my PDP this year isencompassed in my recent retreat. Of course,personal development happens silently, dayafter day, but since my last retreat 18 monthsago it was evident some unfolding hadoccurred. My colleague finishes his reflections by saying, 'the fact that I should prescribe fact-based learning to myself at best misses thepoint'. Misses the point! Unfortunately, I donot feel able to be so forgiving. It's about asfar away from the point as the Virgin Marywas from a brothel. By all means, help meestablish my learning needs, scrutinize mypractice, test my abilities, but do not speak tome of personal development until youunderstand its meaning and its vitalcontribution to my role as 'a good doctor'.My retreat clarified for me that I havepersonally developed in the 18 months sinceI last took stock. It has no doubt benefitedme, my family and my patients. But it is notto be found in so-called 'PersonalDevelopment Workbooks'. It's in my heartand it's a good job that my patients knowwhere to look for it, as the professionseemingly does not. Dr de Quincey's reply Karen, you're invoking arguments that in:\u007f Referring to 'the meaning' (here of personal development) as something towhich you have privileged access over all-those-idiots-who-try-to-lord-it-over-us, atbest come across as petulant, and at worstget lost in the invective. \u007f Thus appropriating 'the meaning', alienates you from what seems to me acentral tenet, nay raison d'etre of medical humanities \u2014 namely that yours is justanother story among innumerable othertakes on the world. For me, we undergo personal development by constantly writing and re-writing ourautobiographies, re-describing ourselves andour relation to the world. This quite simply issomeone who is having a go at getting theirhead round themselves, insight if you will, sothat life up to this moment is at least anattempt at a successful summation of allwhich led up to this moment. The poor buggers trying to see the profession accountable, likewise have another take onthe world. As managers, they have toapproach something from their end, and youfrom yours; what you cannot do is claim a priori high ground because of being a coalface GP. How much better to sound like someone who hears the other stories and makes them partof the next version of yourself; you'd comeacross better to acknowledge that you'vebecome a different person as a result, not justof medical humanities, but of the very act ofgetting vexed over PDP; instead it soundslike a retreat from the latter into the former. So the only way you'll win out over the hijackers of personal development is by yourstyle, by the way you come across after having listened to what they're trying to do,and being as fully as possible in touch withthe character you've become (in the sort ofworld where the powers that be might expectyou to do a PDP). This isn't an argument for superficiality \u2014 it's only saying that the stuff we attend to isfinally subsumed under the way we attend toit. We're presumably worried aboutpomposity in doctors because we think itdoesn't work very well (clouds bipartisanrelationships and impairs decision-making),as well as the more fuzzy stuff about notliking its smell. If you can tell me that the anger I've seen from you about such pomposity is where youwant to end up about it, then maybe you'rejust an angry cow. In which case, if I cansuggest that angry cows don't work verywell, then you might just as well be pompous. If it is a valid emotion on the way to telling me how you're going to exist as a doctor-character who is different and so makes theworld different by existing, then get on andtell me/live it. More immediately, if you sound in your writing like someone who could notassimilate, or felt they had a priori trumping over this argument, then how do I know there The British Journal of General Practice, October 2003 821isn't at least one other sort of character outthere for whom you might do the same thingbehind the consulting room door \u2014 closedown the options and retreat. I certainly can'tshare the terrifying certainty of your lastsentence that your patients will know whereto look for the other side of you. Dr O'Reilly tries again ... Let me try and put it another way I'm notaggressive or pompous all of the time. I'mbits of things on different days and indifferent situations. What I think I have learnt is to recognize which bits are which, how they got there,why they come out to play and not to panicwhen they do. My anger stems from resentment and hurt that in years gone by the profession that issupposed to help people didn't help me. Dayafter day I'd attend to the physical andemotional needs of my patients, while all thetime my own emotional needs wereneglected. I felt as if my medical schooltraining had been designed to rob me ofkeeping in touch with my emotional world.This was a side of my role as a doctor thatwasn't mandatory and could get in the way.When someone in the course of my generalpractice training tried to tap into theemotional torrent it was done in a clumsyand inappropriate way and left most of thosewho experienced it even more resentful. With time and maturity, or whatever, I can look back and understand these things, but atthe time it was really quite unpleasant. Astime has gone by I have found ways to moveforward emotionally, albeit sometimes in arather chaotic way. I feel I am makingprogress and it's how I feel that matters tome and, indirectly, to those that know me. Let me give you a specific example. When I was a little girl I wanted to be an actress butmy parents laughed at me. Well now I am anactress of sorts aren't I? And I love my job. Idon't feel burnt out or stressed. I feelchallenged and satisfied. Part of my job is the science bit. I need to know facts, know how to use them, knowhow to 'do' stuff like drips and minoroperations. And I'm glad the profession istrying to bring in some way of monitoringthis. That is reassuring. But this part is probably akin to an actress learning her lines. Anyone can learn lines butwhat makes an actress great? Her delivery?Her style? Well, it's not a very measurableentity, is it, but for me I see this bit being theperson that I am and this is where my'personal development' comes in. Another example. My father died when I was 20 years old. Being an only child and a'daddy's girl' this was, as you would expect,a pretty devastating experience. Two daysafter his funeral I was back at medical schoolstudying with the Second MB only a fewweeks away. I sailed through. 'Didn't shecope fantastically?'. Never having grievedproperly, the pain of my father's deathlingered on year after year. Whenever I wouldattend a terminally ill patient my emotionswould bubble out. It wasn't unusual for me tobe more visibly upset than the relatives. But this was my pain. I was crying for myself. Eighteen months ago on the medicalhumanities short course we were promptedto write a poem about something importantto us. I produced a short poem to my dad. Isobbed all the way through writing it and allthe way through reading it out to the group. But since then I can think of my dad fondly, feel comfortable with my pain at losing himand can now approach patients as theyapproach death with a feeling of sadnesswithout letting my own intense pain get inthe way. This to me, rightly or wrongly,constitutes 'personal development'. I'm not suggesting that we all go round sobbing, writing poetry. Only, for me, thatworked. The important thing is that werecognize that as doctors there is a part ofwhat we do that is part of who we are andwhere we are on our own emotional journey. And this intangible bit is what makes an actress great or maybe a doctor 'good'. Yes Ihave angry bits. I have vulnerable bits. I havesome low self-esteem. I have some need to beneeded and some fear of needing someone. But overall I quite like the funny mixed- upness that constitutes 'me'. I no longer feelthe need to be 'totally sorted'. I've learnt, Ithink, to just live my life as it is and relish allthe things that come my way. Like a childrummaging through an old box of toys. I canenjoy the experience without fretting that thetoys lay strewn across the attic floor are notin neat, tidy piles. I don't write to be right. Or better. Or revered. I write to feel. For me reflectivewriting is a way of expressing emotions,which at the time of the consultation may beinappropriate or impossible to visit, butwhich nonetheless cannot be ignored. Notthat is if the doctor and the patient are to getthe best out of the consultation process,which at the end of the day is at the heart ofwhat we do. It is not rocket science. It is noteven new. But isn't it about time the profession came out of the closet and recognised thissufficiently to put in place some resources sothat we could actually consider having a'PDP' in the true sense of the word? Karen O'Reilly Matt de Quincey822 The British Journal of General Practice, October 2003 postcards 2003-2004WORKING in the NHS sometimes feels like being caught in a tanglednet. Read codes spread like barnacles across the consultation, defensivemedicine scleroses decision-making and weseem more concerned with the disease thanthe person who has it. Outside theconsulting room work often reduces to afrenetic round of targets, meetings,institutional fads, crazy deadlines and achronic mismatch between aspirations andfunding. Look back 10 years ago and it is clear that practice is changing rapidly \u2014 but in amanner that feels enormously frustrating.This sense of walking through treacle canseem like failure \u2014 personal, practice,political or institutional. In fact it has verylittle to do with health services per se andeverything to do with the wider governanceof the public sector. Twenty years ago all services were delivered as hierarchical bureaucracies \u2014we just referred orthopaedic problems to theorthopods most of whom we knewpersonally because they and we had workedin the same silo institutions for years. Theseinflexible and paternalistic bureaucraciesthen gave way to markets. We attempted toregulate care via the price mechanism andfund-holders made hay with 'buy one getone free' offers on hip replacements. Today, amidst the archaeological rubble of previous systems, services are beingdelivered through multiple, fragmentednetworks. When referring an orthopaedicproblem I am now faced with an ever-greater multiplicity of services and evermore people across the network that want toinfluence that decision. We suffer our veryown version of attention deficit disorder asnumerous issues jostle for attention. Theguidelines, the new single point of access,the patient's own researches on the net, thelatest GPwSI service that the primary caretrust (PCT) is starting, the need to code theencounter accurately \u2014 which is going toget headspace? The move from bureaucracies to networks is happening right across society and isdriven by what has been called thehollowing out of the state. Recognising thatcentral control cannot deliver the flexible,personal services that the public nowdemands; governments have devolvedcontrol and budgets downwards. At thesame time transnational pressures \u2014 EUdictates, globalisation, the power ofmultinationals to move investment around\u2014 force governments to cede powerupwards and outwards. The end result isthat the state becomes hollowed out:government is called on to deliver morewhile its ability to directly control thatPostcards 4 ... The tangled net delivery is progressively whittled away. Faced with this unnerving vacuum, governments across the world haveincreased budgetary straightjackets andimposed output-based targets. At the sametime they declare \u2014 and sincerely believe\u2014 that the balance of power has moveddecisively to the front line. All this reinforces regulation. Targets, protocols, the judiciary, instant mediacommunication of high profile failure,multiple inter-dependencies betweenprogrammes and agencies \u2014 all inexorablylead to more regulation. CHI, NICE, NCCAand the rest proliferate to fill the gapbetween fragmenting central control andincreased public visibility. On the front line this can feel like chaos. In reality a new form of order based onnetworks not hierarchies is emerging. In theold days \u2014 10 years ago \u2014 the NHS waslargely a centralised hierarchy where eachpractice related to a singe hospital andevery patient was registered with a singlepractice. Now network-driven policies arerapidly emerging. Enhanced services willmean a rapid expansion of inter-practiceservice provision. By 2005 patients will beoffered a range of hospitals to choose from.And John Reid's recent suggestion thatpatients should be able to register with aPCT means patients may be able to useseveral practices for different problems.The one-to-many hub and spoke model ofthe old NHS is being transformed into thetangled web of the many-to-manydistributed network. Happily our formal understanding of networks has advanced rapidly recently.Insights from research on the internet helppredict what the new 'networked' NHS maybe like. Firstly, horizontal relationships between nodes (be they people or organisations)become much more important than verticalcommand. For practices this means thatrelationships with neighbouring practicesbecome dominant \u2014 think of localitygroups, local commissioning, sharingenhanced services. For professionals itmeans that teams are becoming essential tothe delivery of care \u2014 understanding whatthe practice nurse is doing and how thatrelates to the work of the PRIMIS facilitatorhas just become key to meeting your qualityoutcomes. For patients it means becomingboth empowered \u2014 for example via web-based resources \u2014 and bewildered assuper-specialisation is delivered acrossfragmented services. Secondly, the behaviour of networks is controlled by flow through the network \u2014The British Journal of General Practice, October 2003 823be it of patients or money \u2014 rather than its structure. No surprise therefore to see thatthe policy offering choice to patients goeshand in hand with one to reform financialflows and set national tariffs for electiveprocedures. Finally the number of connections across a distributed network does not rise linearly.Increasing the number of organisationsdealing with an issue from four to six meansthe possible inter-relationships betweenorganisations rises from 16 to 36. Henceendless meetings and exponential E-mails. Networks and the hollow state are two of the interlocking forces changing the NHS.Together they mean that we can no longerbe lords of our own domain, surveying theconsulting room and all it holds. Instead weare nodes in the net \u2014 the patient pulls thisway, the PCT that, guidelines tighten theweb, the churn of staff can loosen it. In this complex, networked world Sod and Murphy work their usual laws and the sourlaw of unintended consequences can anddoes befall us all. But typically this is notbecause we are stupid, lazy, ill-intentioned orunder-resourced. Unintended consequencesare inevitable because new knowledge isbeing added to the world at an ever-fasterrate. And new knowledge does not increasecontrol of the social world \u2014 it alters thatworld and sets it off in new andunpredictable directions. Networks actuallyreduce the risk of all this new knowledge for Sod and Murphy get networking 'A mostly sunny day, to some, can look a lot like partly grey' said Eeyore.1 Eeyore was a past master at expecting the worst. Yet despite what we see on the news not everything always turns out for the worst and not every unintended consequence is a disaster. Viagra\u00ae has been a blessing for the Black Rhino withnumbers soaring as the aphrodisiac market finally got turned on to evidence-based interventions. Limited access tocomputers in primary school has meant that poetry is booming among 8-10-year-olds as literacy lessons use poems toteach meaning and interpretation and so avoid the tedious chore of text entry. My sister has a parlour game of asking what things have got unequivocally better over the last 20 years, and can produce a list that is cheerfully long \u2014 mobile phones, British food, power tools, computer literacy, the number of books in print,the variety of butterflies, the quality of British beaches, most museums and art galleries. And for health we could add thefall in coronary heart disease, road safety deaths, and the quality of most practice buildings. Such Pollyanna-ish optimism is important because in a networked world improvements are often dispersed and difficult to see. Left to their own devices the feedback loops of the news media know they will garner more attention by concentratingon gore and than on success. Of course Sod and Murphy have not completely morphed into Mr Pangloss. But networks by their nature are more dispersed, trickier to track, than hierarchies. Perhaps things are not quite as bad as they sometime seem. 1. Marshall H. Lessons from the Hundred-Acre Wood . New York: Disney Press, 1999.even if several nodes cease to work the network still functions. Being a node in a netis actually safer than being a lynchpin in ahierarchy \u2014 it just does not feel that way. Itfeels as though we are loosing autonomy. Looked at differently, general practice is well placed to deal with a world built onnetworks. Structurally we already are anetwork of semi-autonomous units linkedthrough a web of relationships. Even more important we are the 'Googles' of our communities with thousands ofconnections stretching across every streetand strata of our localities. In network termspractices are much more deeply rooted, andby much more meaningful transactions,than shops, post offices or even schools.This connectedness is likely to be a hugeasset as we find ourselves deliveringcomplex care in an ageing society made upof fragmented communities. For years general practice has been the sleeping giant of community development\u2014 by and large we have been in ourcommunities, but not of them. In thecoming decade making the most of the rootsthat intimately connect every generalpractice to its network of carers, familiesand organisations will be just as importantas staying abreast of the latestdevelopments in genomics. Paul Hodgkin824 The British Journal of General Practice, October 2003 essay'Is this penicillin?' She wasn't stupid. 'Is it because my husband's given me a dose?'asked the well-dressed woman across thedesk. I'll never forget that day. My answers determined the subsequent course of mymedical career. It hadn't occurred to me thatI would confront an ethical dilemma on myvery first assignment with a distinguishedgentleman of the old school \u2014 the very oldschool. Patients don't walk in with signsaround their necks saying, Here' s a good one for you, doctor. See if you can sort it outin 6 minutes . I was feeling particularly contented, for which I make no excuses other than that Iwas as green as the grass outside. And I wasoff guard, a fatal addition to inexperienceand self-satisfaction in a medical setting.Humming jauntily, I peeked into the waitingroom and saw four women. A dark lady indesigner knock-offs turned the page of anarchitectural journal. A sweet motherly-typeknitted automatically while talking to afemale with aggressively grey hair and agrimace. A blond, middle-aged lady in creamsilk read a popular feminist tome. 'Mrs' \u2014 I looked down at the file\u2014 'Mrs McMurtry?' I looked hopefully at thematernal knitter, who glanced over at meand smiled. The silk lady closed her book with a thump and stood up. 'Coming, doctor,' she said. Maybe she wanted sleeping pills or to renew a prescription. Something non-invasive, Iprayed, intimidated by all that elegance.Then I saw a message I'd missed in myhaste, a note from the principal attached tothe file. See me immediately , I read as I followed her down the corridor to theconsulting room. After shepherding the ladyto a chair opposite the desk, I excusedmyself and scurried down the hall. I wasn't humming when I sat down across from my patient a few minutes later. 'Sorry for the interruption, Mrs McMurtry.' 'That's quite all right, doctor,' she saidpleasantly, adding, 'This is the thirdconsecutive day I've come.' 'Yes,' I replied, looking at the notes. Mr McMurtry, a local politician, had brought his wife a little souvenir from a business trip,of gonococci. At least he had the decency toarrange for her to be treated, but he didn'twant her to know why. We gave penicillinthen as a single daily injection of long-actingsuspension, something like 100 000 or200 000 units, over a 5- or 7-day period. Wegave it in the buttock, because it was bulkyand painful. 'Could you strip down to your undies and hop up on the table? On your tummy,please.' She looked at me for a long moment, then fired off those two fatal questions: 'Is thispenicillin you're giving me? And is itbecause my husband's given me a dose?' I was an honest chap. She was a patient with a right to know the truth, no matter what myprincipal said. After all, I had graduatedfrom medical school. I knew something. Iwasn't prepared to compromise my beliefs,no matter who issued the commandment. 'Yes, and yes,' I answered earnestly.All hell broke loose. I never truly understood the meaning of 'to gather oneselfup' until that moment. Mrs McMurtry'sposture straightened. Her demeanour lostnot an ounce of its composure. Herremoteness increased. Heightened facialpallor gave the only indication of the trueeffect of my words. 'Thank you for your honesty, doctor,' she replied icily. I prepared the syringes as she slid onto the table. Poor woman, having to endure such an unpleasant procedure. She submitted withbetter grace than I could have summoned.She uttered not a word of reproach, nary awhimper, during the indignity of beingjabbed in the buttocks by a very junior GPwielding syringe after syringe, in an ordealrequired by no action of her own. 'Thank you for your honesty, doctor,' she repeated. The quiet way she closed the dooras she left did not presage my principal'sthundering wrath. 'You did what?!' he screamed after I'd trotted down to see him. 'I, um ...' I faltered, the strong staff of truth temporarily wrenched from my quiveringknees. 'Go on, explain yourself, if you can,' he spluttered. I marshalled my forces and squeaked, 'It was the truth.' 'The truth!' he boomed. 'The truth!' I was petrified. 'You have ruined a marriage andlost the practice not one valuable patient butan entire family \u2014 not to mention theunhappiness your honesty' \u2014 he spat theword \u2014 'will bring to all concerned,including yourself.'Two samples from Secrets from the Black Bag , accounts of rural general practice collected by Susan Woldenberg Butler. Secrets from the Black Bag is arranged around the theme of home-visits. Eleven separatecharacters, including two doctors'wives, tell 65 interconnected stories,which cover many situations andexperiences and express a widerange of age, viewpoints, highexpression and downright folly. Based on personal interviews, the stories have been heavilyfictionalised. The GPs interviewedrange from 40-80 years of age. Some are refugees from Britain's NHS. Others are adventurers andidealists. The stories span 80 yearsand countries as diverse as Nigeria,Pakistan, New Zealand, theFalkland Islands, Tanganyika,England, Australia and Scotland, aswell as the high seas. Some of thestories have been published inAustralia; some are with twojournals in the USA.

Susan Woldenberg ButlerSamples from Secrets from the Black Bag Mrs McMurtry's doseThe British Journal of General Practice, October 2003 825I thought about my new wife and our idealistic promises to each other. 'Surelytelling the truth cannot be such a hideousthing,' I replied resentfully. This was before the days of the women's liberation movement. Concepts like truth-telling belong to a later era. At that time,medical ethics as we understand it did notexist in our intensely paternalist profession.The doctor was a god. Patients didn't questionhis \u2014 usually his \u2014 decisions and actions, soMrs McMurtry's inquiries were unexpectedand unsettling. I blurted out the truth withoutthinking. And if I had stopped to reflect? 'You have destroyed that marriage,' he repeated. 'Why didn't you see her yourself, then?''Because, dear sir,' he replied slowly, 'I thought your level of ability sufficientlydeveloped to conduct such a session, anopinion unfortunately not validated.' I hung my head. Telling the truth now seemed like a selfish act. 'You will be informed at the end of the day if your further services are required. I ratherdoubt it.' A much-deflated locum saw a few more patients. The afternoon wore on. I had justfinished writing a script when the phonerang. 'This is it,' I thought glumly. 'On thejob a day and a half and already I've ruinedthe lives of two adults and God knows howmany children. Multiply that over a career.' The telephone's insistence interrupted my calculations. 'Yes?' I said. I recognised the responding grunt. At least, after today I would never see my principalagain, to my eternal relief and certainly his. 'I have decided to keep you on due to prior commitments to my family, commitmentsthat I would break if I could. UnfortunatelyI have exhausted my store of spousal goodwill, although why I am explaining this toyou I do not know.' I breathed a silent sigh of relief.'Please,' he said, 'I beg of you, do not make any more heroic decisions. Just referpatients to me. I will be back in exactly12 days. If there is an emergency or if youhave any problems whatsoever, even smallones, please, please, consult my goodcolleague down the road. The receptionistknows how to reach him, and I have been onthe phone with him this afternoon.' I detected a note of desperation in his voice. 'You put me in this position,' I replied, withno good humour.'An error of judgment for which I shall payfor the rest of my days. This is a small place,you know.' How should I have handled Mrs McMurtry's questions? I replay a variation of myresponse in my head, with the benefit ofmany years' experience. I should have calledin both husband and wife and sat them downnext to one another, with myself nearby, notacross the desk, my knees almost touchingtheirs. I should have said to Mr McMurtry,'If you want to save your marriage, you mustconfess to your wife and beg herforgiveness.' I should have taken MrsMcMurtry's hand and told her that everyonemakes mistakes. From there, my own goodsense and experience would have guided me. By avoiding the truth, she might have steered her marriage to calm waters, despitebeing mated to a cigar-smoking, loud-mouthed, gonorrhoea-ridden bully. Theprincipal knew about her flounderingmarriage. He had the greater knowledge andexperience. On the other hand, my principal and Mr McMurtry were golfing partners. Theycolluded to keep the politician's wife in thedark, when she had every right to know whatailed her. That despotic attitude still sets meoff. Mrs McMurtry taught me my first lesson in medical ethics. To this day, the poor womanvisits me whenever the option of telling thebrutal truth to a patient confronts me. I wasnever unfortunate enough to employ aninexperienced locum with a differentphilosophy of practice who was presentedwith a truth-telling dilemma, thank God. It started as a typical morning at the surgery until the receptionist put through a call. 'Can you go out to the O'Connor place, doc?' asked Lance Smith, a local policeman. 'A child has died.' 'Sure,'I said. I hate it when children die, and I hate it more when the authorities call me in to pick up the pieces. My partner was stitching up a chainsaw accident, so I had to go. I got directions, since I didn'tknow the place. Had never heard of it, which was unusual. I thought I'd found every corner of thecountryside. 'Another thing, doc. Better take the four-wheel-drive.' Warning bells should have rung, but they didn't. The place was up the back of nowhere. Even the people who had farms nearby didn't know about it. I drove down a rough, rutted, rarely used road to a real humpy-looking place, thrown togetherfrom planky-looking wood. It looked roughly made and totally incomplete. No-one had painted it.In the yard sat one old car that went and another a fraction worse that didn't. The door was opened by a man I knew by reputation. Tattoos covered every visible surface of his body. Behind him cowered a pushed-around woman with stringy blonde hair. 'Where's the child?' I asked.They stood aside to let me in and pointed to a bundle on a makeshift bed in a dark corner. Two older children sat nearby, playing with a baby. There's always a baby to consummate the union. 'He had asthma,' the stepfather said authoritatively. The old scenario. We see it so often. These people didn't believe in doctors. They of course knew everything and doctors knew nothing. 'Weknow all about it. We treated it.' So often it's the stepfathers who kill these children. 'What happened?' I asked. The previous night, they had given the poor little fellow some candle vapours to sniff and gone to bed, presumably drunk and stoned, if my nose was correct. They left him, with a candle, sitting bythe fire. The poor lad had obviously had bad pneumonia, with half his chest full of pus. He pulled a blanket over him and died. One jab of penicillin would have given the little bloke a good chance of living. This poor child died a lonely death in the middle of the night in a bloody hovel. It was just so pitiful. This dead little kid was only 5 years old, and about the size of my 2-year-old. That he diedalone bothered me, without even the comfort of a toy animal. With his last bit of strength, hedragged his filthy little blanket across the floor and crawled into bed to die alone. When peopledie, they need the basics of companionship and love. They killed that child. It would not occur to these people that they would be at all responsible. I made four calls to child welfare, who never followed it up. Later I got distressed phone calls fromthe family of the real father, but what could I say? That was one of the few times I haven't been able to bounce back to work. I went home and had a cup of tea. I still think about it.A lonely death in the middle of the nightdigest 826 The British Journal of General Practice, October 2003Les Troyens Sir Colin Davies, London Symphony Orchestra and ChorusThe Proms, Royal Albert Hall, London, 25 August 2003 HOWmany times have I said: 'I must go to the Proms some day'? Don'task. London is a long way from Newcastle and in any case we have lots ofculture up here don't we? Not if reports thatwe are becoming known as the 'Faliraki ofthe North' are to be believed. So, theEditor's offer of a press ticket to hear SirColin Davis conduct Berlioz's Les Troyensin exchange for a review was mostwelcome. This was the great Bank Holiday Monday extravaganza: La Prise de Troie (Acts 1 and2) at 3 p.m. and Les Troyens \u00e0 Carthage(Acts 3 to 5) at 7 p.m., with enough time inbetween to down a bottle of wine with somefood. Excellent. Except that it being AugustBank Holiday weekend, lots of peoplewanted to come to London for the NottingHill Carnival, so it was a sensible time forRailtrack to close half the main lines in thecountry. But we won't dwell on that or onGNER, except to say that their service stinksand so do their trains if you have to stand for5 hours propped up against the toilet door.But being British, we put up with it(although I did think it was pushing it a bitfor a ticket collector to insinuate that weshould be thankful to be on a train at all). And the Proms too are very British in a plummy-voiced, middle class sort of way.Even if the acoustics were poor or theperformance not up to scratch we couldenjoy watching the people and engagingthem in conversation. For example: Me: 'What do you think of it so far?'Plummy voiced character (PVC): 'Davis isperhaps a little too emotional. But I think theLSO is on form. Did you get to Cellini?'Me: 'I heard it on the radio \u2014 we've comedown from Newcastle.'PVC: 'Ah yes, Newcastle. (lip curling): 'But it's not a propersymphony orchestra of course ...' I gave up, but got in a dig about London's Millennium Bridge compared to Gateshead's.I don't think he'd heard of Gateshead. But he was right about the LSO \u2014 and indeed its Chorus and most of the cast. Theywere incandescent. At the centre of thismusical brilliance was Sir Colin Davis,76 years old, resembling Berlioz himselfwith his unruly white hair, a man who hasknown and loved Les Troyens for more thanhalf his life. And it showed in his magisterialcommand of the vast forces arrayed in frontof him. Every detail of this extraordinarilycomplex score was lovingly displayed: theshrill wind and brass of the opening chorusof the Trojan people; the gorgeous clarinetsolo in Andromache's mime (playedexquisitely by Andrew theterrifying octet chorus to thedeath of Laocoon with its off-the-beatbasses (the choral texture and detail herewas a wonder); the raucous brass bandsblazing out the Trojan March from thegallery, and too much more to describe. It was, as the PVC said, emotional. This was a concert performance of a Grand Opera, butwho cared? Petra Lang sang Cassandra, theTrojan princess who was cursed with a giftof prophecy that no-one would believe, withspine-tingling intensity. Her anguish at thefate she foresaw for her people wastempered by flashes of false hope, and byher tenderness toward Corebus (sungperfectly by William Dazeley as anhonourable fellow who is no genius) thefianc\u00e9 she knew she would never marry.Within minutes, eyes were beingsurreptitiously wiped (mine included).Among other fine things was the gloriouslyspooky, descending chromatic scale of theghost of Hector wonderfully sung byJonathan Lemalu from a disembodiedposition in the gallery. After the smoke and darkness of La Prise de Troie, the start of Les Troyens \u00e0 Carthagebreathes sunshine, light breezes andprosperity. Michelle de Young was superb asDido in her journey from proud andconfident queen of Carthage, to the helplesslover of Aeneas who is so distraught by hisleaving her that she commits suicide. Unfortunately, one could not quite see why she was so enamoured of the Trojan hero, asBen Heppner in the role was not on his bestform and was emotionally too restrained, aswell as causing a near disaster by missingsome high notes in Act 5. Along the way to the brutal ending, where the Trojan March overpowers the curses ofthe Carthaginians to predict the ultimatetriumph of Rome (the descendants of theTrojans), we heard wonderful performances.For example, Toby Spence as the Trojansailor Hylas was simple, elegant and movingand the two comical Trojan sentries werebrilliantly done by Darren Jeffrey andRoderick Earle. But to praise every gem one would have to describe the whole opera. All I can say isthat after 5 hours I could have gone backand listened to the whole thing again. Trulyone cannot imagine a greater musicalexperience. Toby LipmanThe British Journal of General Practice, October 2003 827FITZHUGH Mullan takes us on a journey across America, introducing us to acast of compelling characters \u2014 his 'big doctors'. We hear first hand about thelives, dreams and disappointments of 15primary care practitioners. But mostly wehear about their work. Mullan hopes thischaracter-driven approach will be helpful tothose seeking insight into primary care inAmerica. It works: the book is entertaining,thoughtful and at times provocative. It willappeal to clinicians, medical historians andlay readers. What is more \u2014 it is reasonablypriced at \u00a319.95 and only 250 pages long. Mullan interviewed 74 'big doctors' in the late 1990s, asking about their work, whatinspired them and what they thought aboutthe American healthcare system. He turnedthe transcripts into oral histories \u2014 shortautobiographical narratives \u2014 anddeposited the collection in the NationalLibrary of Medicine. The 15 oral historiesforming the core of this book are part of thatcollection. The narratives reveal anextraordinary group of people working invery different settings. Twelve of them aredoctors, two are nurse practitioners, and onea physician assistant. Few of the doctors hada traditional career path and many do notwork in settings corresponding to primarycare in the UK. One San Francisco doctor,for example, sees mainly HIV positive gaymen; another doctor is Dean of anosteopathic medical school. Nevertheless,many of the doctors seem to have developeda strong sense of social justice and at leasttwo of them saw their religious beliefs ashaving a major formative influence in theirlives and work. Most career paths were quiteelaborate and many of the doctors hadadditional academic or administrativeduties, with few spending their whole timeseeing patients. Even fewer had spent theirworking lives in one place after completingmedical training. The commentaries, which Mullan adds to the beginning and the end of the book, arethe least satisfactory parts. He wants to tellBig doctoring in America \u2014 profiles in primary careFitzhugh MullanUniversity of California Press, 2002 HB, 255pp, \u00a319.95, 0 52022670 4 the broader story of the decline of thegeneralist (cast as the hero) and the linkedrise to dominance of the specialist (cast asthe villain) in American health care over thepast 100 years. He believes this has causedthe present inefficient, inequitable andfragmented system. This story is ascompelling as the oral histories, but it is anoversimplification and fails to recognize therole of consumerism, markets, insurancecoverage, political inertia and numerousother factors. Among health professionals, those with a broader view of primary care includingcommunity involvement and multi-disciplinary working may find that this bookhas too narrow a focus. But for those whowant some insight into the lives of primarycare physicians in the USA, this book willbe a valuable resource. Ron Gray INthis book with its topical and promising title, John Speirs is proposingthat UK health care be no longer provided out of general taxation but bechanged to a market-led structure in which'we will see responsible personal choiceamong competing providers who can onlysecure incomes by seeking subscriptionsfrom consumers with a free choice and whocan only retain their loyalty by satisfyingthem' (page 138). There will be a core ofpatient guaranteed care or 'pretty goodcare', patient fund holding, patientguaranteed social insurance, patientguaranteed care associations and patientguaranteed care providers. The governmentwill guarantee the structure funded in themain by general taxation. The individualwill select an insurer and a care plan with apurchasing cooperative, to negotiate choicesand to offer individuals the chance toprovide additional supplementary funding. The author, a champion of the Swiss, French and German healthcare systems in particularstates that the social insurance systems inEurope shows that the poorest are treatedimmeasurably better with legally guaranteedentitlements to fuller health coverage.However, as elsewhere in the book there areno facts to support this statement. This is apity as there is certainly a case for a clearexplanation and comparison of the differentEuropean systems for funding health carewith a critical examination of their strengthsand their weaknesses. Furthermore the authorcould have discussed the social insurancescheme now running in the Republic ofIreland, a country not dissimilar to the UK. Itis essential for the reader to have detailedinformation about how these social insuranceschemes work, what is included and what isexcluded before deciding whether to supportthe author's proposals for changes in the wayour health care is funded. In this scheme proposed by John Speirs, emphasis is laid on the importance ofpreventive care where the individual willreceive incentives for improvements in, forexample, blood pressure. The authorsuggests biannual meetings between patientand a doctor to discuss the individual'spreventive care with a 'loading' potential onthe premium for specific 'destructive lifestyles such as high consumption of alcohol,tobacco and lack of exercise'. A sort ofrevalidation of the patient! While the authoraccepts that staff would need to be trainedfor this he does not explain when GPs andother doctors would find time for thesemeetings nor discuss whether the patientwould tell the truth. The evidence to support the validity of patient fund holding is given as 'therevolution in ophthalmology ... financiallyempowered choice in health care'. Theauthor believes in the UK optics marketthere is one experience for everyone withoptics a public service managed privatelywithin the government's framework of rules.The author suggests that the expanded roleof optometrists in primary care haseffectively reduced pressures on NHSwaiting lists. Yet again there is not a criticalanalysis. While not in any way demeaningthe very excellent work done by manyoptometrists, there is some disquiet amongsome patient groups that not all high streetoptometry chains will dispense the morecomplicated contact lens or spectacleprescription with the result that somepatients are disadvantaged and someoptometrists are not gaining widerexperience. If I had not been invited to review this book, I doubt that I would have persevered to theend. It was a difficult book to read. Thepolemic style and the very frequent use ofsometimes obscure references in support ofstatements can be tedious and detracts ratherthan supports key points. This is a pity asJohn Speirs is making an important point. Patricia WilkiePatients, power and responsibility: the first principles of consumer-driven reform John SpeirsForeward: by The British Journal of General Practice, October 2003THEgreat American film director John Huston famously once called it 'Theonly film festival that's worth a damn'. Now in its 57th year, the EdinburghInternational Film Festival has expanded farbeyond its humble beginnings as adocumentary film festival and for 2 weeksevery August it brings the most exciting,innovative and dangerous cinema toScotland. Truly international, the Festivalcan justifiably claim to have something totease the palate of any moviegoer. While 2003 may have lacked the more obvious must-see films of recent years whenthe buzz surrounding The Full Monty , Ratcatcher eclipsed the films Festival's commitmentto dynamic new talent from around theworld has never been stronger and for achange much of that talent was home-grown. The biggest buzz this year surrounded David MacKenzie's second feature Young Adam . Adapted from a novel by Scottish Beatauthor Alexander Trocchi and playing likeLast Tango on the Clyde, the film has thewhiff of necrophilia about it as it charts anarcissistic failed writer's moral free fall.From its opening with a drowned womanbeing fished from the Clyde, the spectre ofspoilt film's brooding hero,Joe (human he drifts from one bout of joyless ruttingto the next, wallowing in a hell of his ownmaking. Already notorious for McGregor'sless than romantic use of custard (in a scenethat feels like it's wandered in from a PaulVerhoeven film), Young Adam is a cold beauty of a film, a numbing meditation onfutility, guilt and despair that deserves theacres of newsprint it has already spawned,but it's a hard film to like. Much more satisfying is the Scots-Danish co-production Wilbur (Wants To Kill Himself) , a touching black comedy about love, suicide and terminal illness. Self-destructive Wilbur (Jamie Sives) is barredfrom his support group and moves in withhis eternally optimistic older brotherHarbour (Adrian Rawlins). In between half-hearted suicide attempts and running theirsecond hand bookshop, love enters thebrothers' lives in the shape of shy singlemother Alice (Shirley Henderson). Buttragedy is waiting just around the corner...Sweet without ever being sickly, Wilbur is a gem of a film, beautifully written anddirected, that never allows the bleakeraspects of the story to smother the gentleromance at its heart. While all theperformances are strong, special mentionhas to be made of 11-year-old LisaMcKinlay who plays Alice's daughter, avery wise head on very young shoulders.Wilbur is a very human film, genuinely affecting without ever being mawkish oroverly sentimental. None of the films shown this year are going to rewrite cinema history but that's no badthing. There were good films and bad, smartfilms and dumb, highs and lows. ClintEastwood may have withdrawn his Mystic River at the last minute but there was traditional Hollywood fare on offer inmovies like Ned Kelly , Camp, and Party Monster , a decadent portrait of the rise and fall of 1980s club kid Michael Alig (anangelic Macaulay Culkin). Richard Jobson's16 Years Of Alcohol , Solid Air and Afterlife along with Wilbur and Young Adam showed how diverse and vibrant the Scottish filmindustry can be. Maverick director Jonas Akerlund (director of the Prodigy's Smack My Bitch Up video) transferred his grungy, pop videosensibilities to the big screen with Spun a frenetic, paranoid voyage into the lives of agroup of Californian speed freaks. With itsmix of explicit sex, wired to the moonanimation and constant drug taking, Spun was destined for cult status long beforeAkerlund gave us the image of a constipatedMena Suvari defecating. Far more sedate was Torremolinas 73 , a low- rent Boogie Nights relocated to Franco's Spain. Audiences were charmed by this taleof a Bergman obsessed amateur filmmakerdrifting into making cheap Super-8 pornwith his wife and the image of a black-cloaked Death getting jiggy with the heroinegave Young Adam' s custard cream a run for its money in terms of ludicrous sex scenes.

There was genre-hopping sci-fi from Japan in Returner and from America came ironic gore in Cabin Fever , a film which gave us obnoxious teens in a cabin in the woods battling scary localsand a flesh-eating virus. Elsewhere, Peter Greenaway came back from the dead with the ambitious, wilfullyobtuse The Tulse Luper Suitcases , his single- handed attempt to reinvent the medium offilm as a complete immersive experiencewith a project that encompasses featurefilms, TV , books, the internet and computergames, while Oliver Stone was remarkablycoherent in a Q&A session following thescreening of Comandante , his intimate documentary interview of Fidel Castro. The subject of this year's Retrospective (titled Hateful Man ) was the misanthropic Henri-Georges Clouzot who with The Wages Of Fear and Les Diaboliques proved himself a master of suspense to rival Hitchcock andwhose 1943 film The Raven led to him being black-listed after World War II and accusedof Nazi collaboration. Ultimately sidelinedby the birth of the French New Wave,Clouzot's films are pitiless portraits of greedand frailty which reflect his own cynicismand his influence is evident in the work ofScorsese, De Palma and William Friedkin(who remade, unsuccessfully, The Wages Of Fear ) and the generation of movie brats who are championed elsewhere in the Festival inthe documentary A Decade Under The Influence . For me though, the best film was The Other Final , a documentary that wore its heart on its sleeve (just below the captain'sarmband). Hilarious and touching, itchronicles Dutch filmmaker Johan Kramer'sscheme to organise an alternative World CupFinal (on the same day as the real final)between the two worst football teams in theworld, Montserrat and Bhutan. Hisobsession takes him from Europe to theCaribbean and finally the roof of the world,the Himalayas, encountering along the wayfootballing policeman, a prime minister whois also the manager of his country's nationalside, Zen archery and the most irritatingfootball song in the world. Quietly profound, the film never mocks its subjects and gives the audience a real Davidand Goliath story where there are no losers.The Other Final is the reason why film festivals exist; without them films this goodwould be relegated to Channel 4 in the weesmall hours. Festivals should be acelebration of the possibilities of cinema anda platform for unique and talented voices. This year, Edinburgh came pretty close. David Watsonational Film Festival roger neighbour behind the lines On performanceIFit's still on when you read this, and if you possibly can, catch Tom Stoppard's Jumpers at the National Theatre. This farce, which I saw premiered in 1972 \u2014 oh God!, the yearI started vocational training \u2014 this ever-fresh farce brings into unlikely collision the disparate worlds of philosophy and acrobatics. George our crumpled hero, stunningly played by becardiganed Simon Russell Beale, is that GP of the academic world, the Professor of Moral Philosophy. He is flagrantly cuckoldedby the smooth-talking consultant-resembling Archie, Vice Chancellor, psychiatrist andamateur acrobat. Another member of the acrobatic squad has been inadvertently shot byGeorge's wife, Dotty. Complications, as they say, set in. I love wordplay, and Stoppard's delicious linguistic pyrotechnics have me in heaven. For example: George, an amateur archer, soliloquising on Zeno's paradox, convinces himselfthat 'though an arrow is always approaching its target, it never quite gets there, and SaintSebastian died of fright.' Laugh? Till the tears ran down my leg. Why am I telling you this? Several weeks have gone by since I saw the play, and like all good art it's left something behind inside me, niggling away. It is hard to put into words;bear with me. Many GPs find their work engenders a form of spiritual fidgeting, a reaching-out for deeper meaning, an inclination to squeeze a little significance out of life's spitefulnesses. Asdoctors, we are valued for the empathic way we can come alongside individual people intheir individual extremity, and simultaneously for our role as the wise and detachedprofessional. It comforts patients to think we can see the big picture while they carry onsuffering the small ones. For a doctor to view patients' predicaments as so many wrinklesin the fabric of the universe is not callous or dismissive. It helps; for if we can take them inour stride, then \u2014 by proxy \u2014 so can they. In a word, the job makes philosophers of us, philosophers of the Stoic persuasion. Since we too are mortal and made of wrinkles, it takes a lot of practice to look uncrumpled, to actunfazed. And there is a sense, too, in which we must be acrobats. Good doctoring calls forbalance, timing, cooperation and agility \u2014 if not of the body, at least of the intellect. Thedropped catch, the fatal plummet is only a fumble away. I think the niggling heresy with which Stoppard has infected me is the wish to recognise general practice as a performance art. I don't mean simply in the 'All the world's a stage'sense, which holds people, ourselves included, to be no more than the portfolio of roles intheir repertoire. Anthony Rooley, in a book on performance 1, takes the Shakespearean view, seeing all our actions, every interplay of relationships and pursuits of all kinds as'performance'. 'At times,' he acknowledges, 'it seems as though such a view may take allspontaneity out of everything, only for us to discover that potentially it leads to yet greaterfreedom.' Rooley suggests that 'if we play our roles with ease, unselfconsciously, with loveand care, then through our play we may blossom, and those around us too.' If we buy into the idea of 'general practice as performance', and its corollary that GPs are actors, we must also accept the problems that go with it. Not least is the fundamental ironyevery actor faces \u2014 if he 2is to move the audience, he must himself remain unmoved and in command of his performance. This is an old chestnut. The 18th century French man ofletters Denis Diderot argued 3that great actors must possess judgment and penetration without 'sensibility' \u2014 that is, without actually experiencing the emotions they areportraying as characters on the stage. For to do so would be to lose the ability to lift theaudience or patient to yet greater insights. Diderot asked how the actor is to catch just thepoint at which he must stop being himself and become the practitioner of a contrived andwell-rehearsed skill. He couldn't answer his own question; but then, he had not had thebenefit of being in a Balint group. That great theatre takes place, albeit unwitnessed, in the consulting room few will deny. Occasionally Shakespearean in its import, it is more often Ibsen, or else Alan Bennett. Nostage or TV drama has quite captured the cameo subtleties of the two-handers played outbetween GP and patient every 6 minutes. Yet the consultation provides a ritual which (toquote Rooley again) 'in the moment of performance has relevance for our entire lives. Theexperience of performance contains such powerful things: heightened states of awareness,moments of incredible clarity, profound admiration and respect.' Applause?

(1713-1784) Paradoxe sur acting]: written 1773, published 1830.matters arising 830 The British Journal of General Practice, October 2003TRA VELLING in the mind as well as body is one of the great expectationsof a good holiday, and my baggage allowance is always endangered by a stockof books in the summer vacation. Tuckedbetween certain cult texts of magicalteenage fiction (which I felt obliged to readpurely for anthropological purposes), andEliot's Daniel Deronda (the closest I allow myself to get to classic romances), I wasprivileged to be taken on an entirelyunpredicted journey by this slim andscholarly work. It transported me to a time when, while Western Europe was still trying to upgradeits agriculture from hunter-gathering, thecultures of the Middle and Far East werealready sharing complex therapeuticknowledge through written translations andpersonal exchange (page 10). Kahl raises aninteresting point in the introduction when henotes that a work of this nature could onlybecome possible when a language reaches acertain level of formality and consistencycapable of expressing formal theory. Again,this points up the sophistication of theArabic culture at a time when, together withChina, India and Greece it constituted thecore of civilisation. Sabur ibn Sahl (d. 869 CE), the author of the original text, was an Iranian whose famewas derived from his practice as a physicianat the court of the Abbasid caliphs inSamarra in Iraq, and who in particular wascelebrated for his expertise inpharmacology. The work is largelytherapeutic recipes, based on a truly exoticrange of ingredients denoting the globaltrade in which Arabia was even thenengaged (page 16). As with contemporarydrug formularies (such as the BNF), there isno intellectual attribution of the recipes tothose many who must have shared theirexperience with ibn Sahl: one assumes thathis personal choice of therapies wassufficiently unique to justify his authorship,and that his choice to record this forposterity was the defining step in making thedispensatory his own, subsequently to beadhered to and modified by others(page 29). Every paragraph implies a wealth of scholarly activity \u2014 from the transcriber ofthe text after the death of ibn Sahl (page 14),through to the efforts to locate and identifyits author, and Kahl's own programme ofwork on Arabist literature, including thistranslation into English. The mostimpressive scholarship is that of thephysician himself, who also wrote a 'large'dispensatory; presumably this one is the'Vade Mecum' of the Arab practitioner?Reading the dispensatory made me acutelyaware of the lifelong effort required toperfect and transmit a body of clinicalknowledge, especially when working acrosslanguage barriers. Kahl notes that thelanguages of the text (and for himself whenannotating and verifying) were at leastArabic, Syriac, Greek and Persian/Sanskrit(page 24) \u2014 impressive to me, havingwitnessed the extreme difficulties of nativeEnglish speakers to converse in any otherlanguage at international conferences. Allthis must be set alongside time commitmentsto clinical practice and treatmentpreparations \u2014 some of which needed6 months plus to mature, after pounding,kneading, straining, melting and a host ofother mixings and measurings. It is alwaystempting to assume that we work harder thanany physicians before us, but the vividpicture of ibn Sahl conjured by hisdispensatory made me wonder if this is true. In fact, it is the joy of studying the history of medicine that comparisons enable us toevaluate our own otherwise taken forgranted assumptions about contemporarypractice. This book is immersed in theGalenic tradition of humours (pages 6-7),the need for balance, and above all anemphasis on homeostasis which, inembracing environment and 'the passions ofthe soul' (page 11), may truly be regarded asThe Small DispensatorySabur ibn Sahl \u2014 translated from the Arabic by Oliver Kahl Brill Academic Publishers, 2003HB, 242pp, EUR 79.00, 90 04 12996 0The British Journal of General Practice, October 2003 831neville goodman Bits and puddingsWHATis it about children and bits? We were having breakfast in ahotel not usually overrun by children: it's a quiet town house hotel,more usually frequented by business menand women in the week and at the weekendby the sort of couple who come down verylate to breakfast. It was the weekend, wewere not late down, and we were followedinto the breakfast room by three seriouslooking girls who could only have beensisters. Staying in the hotel was obviously atreat for them, and being allowed down forbreakfast without parents even more of atreat. They carefully selected a table forthree and sat down. Only one was tallenough for her legs to reach the ground. The waitress approached and asked if they wanted orange juice. There was a shortpause before the eldest sister asked, 'Is itreal orange juice?' The whole dining room held its breath. A collective smile greeted the inevitable,'Has it got bits in?' It didn't help to ask some experts on the subject (two nieces) what the problem waswith bits. One claimed to like bits; the otherjust said the taste was 'funny'. As the bitstaste no different from the juice, this makesno sense to the adult mind. It must be downto texture, but what about some of the otherthings that children are happy to put in theirmouths, such as particles extracted fromtheir noses? Hotel dining rooms are eavesdropping heaven. Medical matters seem to need aloud voice: do these diners imagine that noone can hear their tales of operations gonewrong? Or are they hoping for anunsolicited second opinion, because it isdifficult sometimes not to leap up and say,'Look here: I'm a doctor and what you'vesaid is nonsense!' The woman who statedauthoritatively, 'Cold drinks in hot weatheronly make you hotter, because your bodyhas to heat the water up,' really did deservea tutorial on the laws of thermodynamics\u2014 or at least her companions did. Americans are especially prone to medicine at dinner. One loud couple hadbored the whole dining room at dinner withdiscussions of their blood pressures andvarious of their glands. They started upagain at breakfast. It was the sort of hotelthat provided a comprehensively deliciouscooked breakfast, including black pudding. 'Say,' said the husband loudly to the waitress, 'What's in this black puddinganyway?' And she told him. After which heremained pretty quiet for the rest of themeal.holistic. The fact that our own models ofhealth and illness barely relate to thesetherapies shows how deeply treatment islinked with the cultural assumptions andapproaches of an historical period. I expectthat a reader 1000 years from now wouldstruggle to recognise the bioscientificparadigm which we currently assumedefines 'reality'. Potential readers should be clear that the bulk of the text is recipes, but that evaluationof their potential clinical efficacy fallsoutside the scope of this book. Thepersonality of ibn Sahl and his patients areabsent from the book, because very littleexists about either; and the context andimpact is largely conveyed by Oliver Kahl'sintelligent and restrained introduction. Thoselooking for an action packed plot, or indeedeven a commentary on the clinical practiceof the period, will be disappointed: this bookis more like a work of art, whose impact issubliminal, and whose significance formedicine is hard to define. I recommend itprimarily because it reminds us of thegenerations of physician and scholars whoseefforts precede our own; because the imageof the dispensing is so artistic anduncommercial; and because it is humbling. It also, in these troubled times, caused me to reflect on the impact of disruption of clinicallearning due to political conflicts. What ifSabur ibn Sahl had been unable to discusshis work with his Indian and Chinesecounterparts? Not been able to get his Celticnard, Malabar cardamom, or Yemenite alumbecause of he was ofan unfavoured race? Been unable orunwilling to learn other tongues because ofcultural parochialism? I doubt that Kahlintended these to be the key lessons derivedfrom his work, which in the end is aspecialist Islamic text. It is, nevertheless, abook both delightful and salutary.

It is mid-winter and 27\u00de Celsius. The sky is blue and the sea is calm (and at this time of the year empty of box jellyfish, the most poisonouscreatures on the planet). I am here on a fact-finding mission. Those of you who read my last column might remember my ambition to work abroad. So the fact I am trying to find is whether I wouldlike to work here. The weather is definitely a major factor in the decision-making process.However, the locals \u2014 to scare me off perhaps \u2014 warn of the heat and humidity ofsummer. Rather more frightening for the locals however, would be the sight of my tallgangly husband in the informal work attire of shorts and loud shirts (I hope he doesn'tread this). A local GP and academic tries to explain to me the intricacies of the Australian health service. Terms such as 'Medicare' and 'bulk billing' are difficult to untangle. It appears severalsystems run in parallel. The one concrete fact is that home visits are a thing of the past ...usually. The local practice where I would work if all things come to pass, like many here, isshort of physicians; and there has been no female doctor for a while. That's ok I think, untilI discover that doctors do most of the cervical smears and recall is 1-2 years. There arepractice nurses in some places, but they seem to be restricted to the tasks our nurses carriedout over a decade ago. The Department of General Practice at the James Cook University in Townsville is responsible for undergraduate and postgraduate training programmes across the north of thestate. This includes providing continuing professional development for the 70 GPs whopractise in an area the size of England and Wales. Videoconferencing is the main point ofcontact. GP registrars are attached to one-doctor towns separated from their peers byhundreds of miles, \u2014 oops kilometres \u2014 of outback. They seem to relish the challenges ofthis isolated life, but whether they will want to continue to work this way after qualificationis unclear. The shortage of qualified GPs is a major problem. The fellowship examination of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP), equivalent to British membership, isthe mandatory endpoint of vocational training. Owing to the need for more doctors theRACGP has recently relaxed the rules for the right to practise of foreign graduates. Possessing MRCGP is now considered to be a sign of competence. This has caused some illfeeling among Australian GPs who still find it difficult to have their postgraduatequalification and experience recognised by the JCPTGP. Doctors without general practice certification are allowed to work in areas of need for a limited time, but receive lower item of service fees. They are expected to do the fellowshipwithin a certain number of years. This means that the least culturally attuned andexperienced doctors are working in remote areas and they tend to treat only acute problems,neglecting prevention. The undergraduate medical course at the university is now in its fourth year. The curriculum is community focussed and the aim is for students to learn a high proportion oftheir medicine, surgery and other 'specialities' in general practice. Ultimately it is hopedthat the resulting doctors will work in the state and ease some of the workforce problems.There are huge deficits in the provision and uptake of services by the Indigenouspopulation. The week before I left on my trip The Guardian ran a story about race riots in Townsville. 1This caused a major upset in the city and denials from the mayor. Other random thoughts: David Beckham is also ubiquitous here, Australian television programmes are interrupted by adverts every 10 minutes, people are very friendly ... anddid I mention the weather?
