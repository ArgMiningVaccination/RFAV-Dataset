It aims to uproot the mental and physical origin of issues to re-establish balance. Naturopaths also offer preventative measures for optimal healthspan and lifespan. During a detailed consultation a naturopath may employ diagnostic tools such as iris diagnosis or functional testing. Treatment often involves nutrition, supplements, herbs, body therapies and lifestyle modifications. Ayurveda Considered Yoga's sister science, Ayurveda is an ancient system of health, life and longevity. If you want to know the best daily routine, diet and herbs - try Ayurveda. A consultation helps you to understand your elemental constitution, strengths and vulnerabilities. Are you a slim, spritely Vata? Perhaps a hot, passionate Pitta? Or could you be a calm, caring Kapha? Effective herbs such as adaptogenic ashwagandha and brain boosting brahmi are part of the Ayurvedic toolkit.

She listens to what is happening to you, mind, body and spirit and then works to find the best way to support you. It's rare to find such 'care factor' in a practitioner. Thank you Caroline. - Letitia D Caroline has been looking after my family for over 20 years! She has always met our health and emotional requirements with her professional knowledge, empathy and support. Her wealth of experience is evident in every consultation. Her thoroughness and patient care follow up is always appreciated. She has helped me personally as a young mother through to menopausal issues. Helped my son through childhood ailments and offered support to my husband through his amputation, even visiting him in hospital providing after care treatments to cope with phantom pains using massage, dietary and mental support. I value her support enormously and have recommended her to numerous friends and colleagues over the years. Her door is always open and that in itself is amazing in this busy life we all lead. - Christina A "}
