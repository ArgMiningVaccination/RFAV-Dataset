It is an adaptation and extension of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) used to treat humans. The two branches of TCVM offered by Winter Park Veterinary Hospital are [acupuncture](https://wpvet.com/general-care/acupuncture-for-dogs-and-cats/) and herbal medicine. Acupuncture Acupuncture, defined as the insertion of needles into specific points on the body to cause a desired healing effect, is used all over the world, either by itself or in conjunction with Western medicine, to treat a wide variety of maladies in every species of domestic and exotic animals. For more information about acupuncture, please visit our acupuncture services page. Herbal Medicine Herbs are plants that contain ingredients with active therapeutic properties. These active ingredients may be present in the whole plant or only in a specific part. An herb may be used in various forms, including teas, granular extracts (Chinese medicine), fresh herbs, dried herbs, liquids, oils, or tinctures. It may be commercially available as a loose herb, capsule, tablet, liquid extract, lotion, or cream. Herbal therapy is the use of herbs, either as single products or in combination with other herbs, for medicinal purposes. Herbal treatment must only be administered after an accurate diagnosis has been made. Because of the differences in physiology between animal species and humans, and the potential for harm if herbs are administered inappropriately, only a professionally trained veterinarian should prescribe herbal treatments. We would be pleased to discuss whether your dog or cat would benefit from acupuncture. "}
