Preventative Care We ask that regardless of your risk, and for the safety and health of everyone in our community, including the chronically ill and your healthcare team at Decatur County Memorial Hospital, that you practice the following guidelines to prevent the spread of illness: - Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based sanitizer that contains 60% to 95% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them until they are dry. You should use soap and water if your hands are visibly dirty. - Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. - Avoid sharing household items. Do not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, or bedding that are not your own. - Clean all \"high-touch\" surfaces, such as counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and steering wheels. Use household disinfectants every day. - Stay home if you are experiencing signs and symptoms of any illness. This is called social distancing. It is one of the best strategies for limiting the spread of illness. - Monitor your own health. Be diligent in listening to changes in your body that might represent illness, and take care to limit the spread of your illness to others.
