It is based on a background document prepared by Carville, Morgan, Cowie and Stewart for a Technical Consultation on hepatitis B birth dose held in Melbourne, Australia in December 2010, and includes re-examination of the evidence in the form of a scoping review conducted in March 2012. This document has been endorsed by the members of the Immunization Practices Advisory Committee of the WHO EPI. The support of Compass: the Women's and Children's Health Knowledge Hub, an initiative of the Australian Agency for International Development, and the Victorian Operational Infrastructure Support Programme in the production of this document, are gratefully acknowledged, as are the notable contributions of peer reviewers Francisco Averhoff, Diana Chang Blanc, David Hipgrave, Osman Mansoor and Steven Wiersma.viiiixExecutive summary This scoping review summarizes and appraises the evidence from published and grey literature on improving coverage of the hepatitis B birth dose vaccine. The review looks at implementation evidence in relation to two main questions: What practices improve coverage of the hepatitis B birth dose? What are important facilitators and barriers to improving coverage of the birth dose? The purpose of the review is to contribute to an evidence base on which to develop programmatic guidance for delivery of the birth dose, both in settings where this is being introduced for the first time, and in those requiring strengthening of services for birth dose vaccination. A systematic search of published and grey literature, covering publications up until March 2012, was undertaken. This was supplemented, where necessary, by expert opinion and commentary, including the proceedings of a technical consultation convened in December 2010. Sixty-five studies were found that met the inclusion criteria. They covered 13 settings, with the broadest range of evidence coming from China, Indonesia, the United States of America (USA) and Viet Nam. No studies from Africa met the inclusion criteria. Evidence exists to suggest that the following practices can be effective in improving coverage of timely birth dose vaccination. This list includes practices useful in all settings, as well as options to consider for special situations. 1) Service delivery arrangements Increasing access to skilled care at the time of childbirth. Integration of birth dose with maternal and newborn care in health facilities by: a local health facility policy specifying birth dose vaccination; - standing orders for administration of birth dose in the delivery room - or postnatal ward; ensuring vaccine is available in the delivery room or postnatal - ward;clear delineation of who is responsible to vaccinate that includes - maternal health-care providers; appropriately positioning birth dose vaccination within - essential newborn care in a way that does not interrupt urgent interventions;coordinated planning between immunization and maternal health - staff in health facilities and in districts, including supportive health-facility assessments.xLinkages between immunization and private services providing childbirth care. Where infants are born outside health facilities, considering options such as: home visits to provide timely vaccination; - integration of birth dose with home visits for other postnatal care; - vaccine storage outside the standard cold chain in a controlled - temperature chain; careful pregnancy tracking. - 2) Health workforce considerations Addressing health-care providers' lack of knowledge and particular attitudes and perceptions towards newborn vaccination.Well-structured health-worker training, including education on perinatal transmission; backed up by frequent follow-up and supportive supervision; - considering options for task-shifting to reach populations difficult - to access. 3) Medical technologies relevant to birth dose Distribution and storage arrangements that utilize the potential for keeping vaccine outside the standard cold chain, and positioning it as close to the birth place as possible.The potential use of Uniject by community-based health-care providers. Ensuring supply of monovalent hepatitis B vaccine in single-dose or multi- dose presentations. 4) Health information system practices Birth registries and community birth notification, including tracking home births.Incorporation of birth dose and its timing within vaccination records. Accurate definition of timely birth dose in coverage reporting. Consider options for the use of sero-surveys for establishment of need and for monitoring. 5) Financing arrangements influencing birth dose coverage Adequate funding for birth dose programmes, with consideration of transport efficiencies for distribution to the periphery.Minimizing costs to families. 6) Addressing community concerns or lack of knowledge regarding birth dose Responding to low awareness of the birth dose vaccine and its importance.Considering traditional practices of sequestering newborns. Addressing fear of adverse events, including planning for the risk of coincidental newborn death or disease.Responding to parental refusal of vaccination. xi7) Leadership and governance practices include: consideration of a central policy that mandates universal newborn vaccination; clear national guidance defining timely birth dose as within 24 hours of birth;removing unnecessarily stringent restrictions contraindicating vaccination; considering options for vaccine use managed outside the standard cold chain in a controlled temperature chain (CTC), and accrediting new vaccinators;strong central communications to support public confidence in vaccines. For certain important practices, guidance can rely on more general evidence for effective implementation of immunization programmes. These areas include: preparatory communication strategies that plan for likely public concerns; alignment with maternal, newborn and immunization care guidelines; costing of strategies to scale-up birth dose within and beyond health facilities. Lastly, in countries without a universal birth dose, adding a birth dose is likely to require steps very similar to those for the introduction of a new vaccine, even if hepatitis B vaccination for older infants is already in place. For these settings, general resources from WHO and partners on the introduction of new vaccines will be useful to supplement guidance, specific to the birth dose, derived from the evidence base above.xii1 WHO/IVB/12.11The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that \"all infants should receive their first dose of hepatitis B vaccine as soon as possible after birth, preferably within 24 hours\" (1), even in countries where Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is of low endemicity. This scoping review compiles the evidence for practices that improve coverage of the hepatitis B 'birth dose' 1, as well as barriers to, or facilitators of, improved coverage. The aim is to provide an evidence base for guidance documents, for regional and national managers working in immunization and maternal and newborn health-care programmes. 1.1 Birth dose vaccination is important to the control of HBV infection As a leading cause of liver cancer and liver disease, HBV infection is an important threat to global health. Globally, over two billion people are estimated to be living with the virus, while around 360 million are chronically infected and at risk of developing life-threatening liver diseases. Many infections are acquired early in life; perinatally, or horizontally during early childhood, particularly in regions of high endemicity where these routes are the most common modes of HBV transmission (1). This has important implications for disease prevention and control as the likelihood of developing chronic infection is higher at younger ages: 90% if infected at birth; 25%-50% if infected between the ages of one to five years, and 5%-10% if infected over the age of five years (2,3). Vaccination against HBV has proved to be an important tool in preventing transmission of the virus. Typically given in a series of three doses, the vaccine provides protection from infection in more than 95% of healthy infants, children and young adults. In infants born to infected mothers, vaccination reduces the likelihood of developing HBV infection by 3.5 times (1 ). The vaccine's efficacy in preventing perinatal transmission however, decreases as the time period between birth and the first dose increases (3 ). The risk of HBV infection among infants born to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive mothers was found to be eight times higher when the birth dose was administered after seven days from birth, compared to when it was administered within the first three days after birth. In areas where chronic infection is endemic, it is especially critical that the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine is administered with minimal delay after birth. In low endemicity countries as well, the birth dose remains important, to prevent early transmission (1). Resolution 63.18 of the World Health Assembly, which focused on viral hepatitis, urged the WHO to further support Member States in accelerating and strengthening prevention and control of viral hepatitis (4). In line with this mandate and the importance of the timing of hepatitis B vaccination, in 2009, WHO recommended that all infants worldwide receive a birth dose as soon as possible after birth, preferably within 24 hours (5).1. IntroductionPractices to improve coverage of the hepatitis B birth dose vaccine 21.2 The hepatitis B birth dose vaccination has unusual programmatic needs The hepatitis B birth dose is different to other vaccinations administered under the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) in that delivery of the vaccine is not schedulable. This places special demands on health systems to respond within 24 hours of childbirth, with different implications for where the vaccination should be provided, who should provide it and how it should be recorded. Attitudes and practices of families and providers at the time of childbirth are also often different to those relating to older infants. In many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), health-system weaknesses limit access to skilled health-care providers at the time of childbirth, or in the early postnatal period (6) with many babies born outside health facilities (7). In early 2011, global coverage of the birth dose was still estimated to be very low, at 26% (8). Understanding how to increase delivery of birth dose in such settings is crucial; however there has been no review of the evidence for strategies pursued to increase and improve provision of timely (within 24 hours of birth) birth dose 1 of the hepatitis B vaccine, particularly made relevant to LMICs. 1.3 Objectives of this review The review summarizes and appraises the evidence from published and grey literature on improving coverage of the hepatitis B birth dose. Specifically, the review looks at the evidence in relation to two main questions: what practices improve coverage of the hepatitis B birth dose? (the primary review question); what are important facilitators and barriers to improving coverage of the birth dose? The purpose of this review is to provide an evidence base on which to develop programmatic guidance for delivery of the birth dose, both in settings where this is being introduced for the first time, and those requiring strengthening of services for birth dose vaccination. Users of such guidance are likely to be working in regional and national immunization and maternal and child health (MCH) programmes. The review elicits models on how to improve coverage of the birth dose from all settings, but seeks to make them especially applicable to LMICs. It also addresses the managerial issues around birth dose implementation, but does not address the health policy questions of whether or not a birth dose should be introduced \u2014 for this see the WHO hepatitis B Position Paper (1). 1 From here on, timely birth dose refers to administration within 24 hours.3 WHO/IVB/12.11A review of published and grey literature was undertaken, covering publications up until March 2012. This was supplemented, where necessary, by expert opinion and commentary, including proceedings of a technical consultation convened in December 2010. Expert opinion, for this review, was defined as that expressed during the December 2010 Technical Consultation (Annex 2), or opinions published by the World Health Organization in the Weekly Epidemiological Record, their technical consultations, or the Western Pacific Regional Office's Operational Guidelines (3). 2.1 Search strategy Five electronic databases were searched for relevant literature (published in English only), including dates up until March 2012. Inclusion criteria for this review were broad, recognizing that research related to implementation often lacks formal experimental studies. However, only literature that related practices, facilitators and/or barriers to an outcome of birth dose coverage or birth dose uptake was included. Publications were excluded that studied only selective testing and vaccination, plus those that only measured coverage, immunogenicity or vaccine efficacy, without providing analysis on underlying determinants of coverage. While the focus of this review is on birth dose delivered within 24 hours, literature that examined issues related to administration of the birth dose up to one week after birth was accepted. Papers that studied multiple vaccines were also accepted, provided that one of the vaccines was the hepatitis B birth dose. A total of 3676 peer-review published titles were identified, yielding 2899 exclusive titles after removal of duplicates. Screening of titles resulted in 470 eligible abstracts, of which 334 were excluded. Two additional relevant articles were identified, from scanning of reference lists, giving 138 full-text articles for review. Twenty-six grey literature papers were also reviewed. Six older full-text articles were not accessible, so in total 158 full-text papers were assessed. A final number of 48 published articles and 17 grey literature papers were judged as meeting the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Annex 1 provides additional detail on the search strategy, a figure describing the screening process, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and a table of excluded papers with reasons for exclusion.2. MethodsPractices to improve coverage of the hepatitis B birth dose vaccine 42.2 Classification of practices, facilitators and barriers and data extraction Practices, facilitators and barriers to improving coverage of the hepatitis B birth dose were classified into six groups, following a WHO framework for health systems: service delivery; health workforce; medical products, vaccines and technologies; health information systems; financing, and leadership and governance. Within these groups, there was further classification into sub-groups. Table 1 below provides an overview and description of the classification. Additional description of the data-extraction framework is provided in Annex 1. Data from each of the 65 papers included in this review, were analysed and abstracted into a standard tool, developed by the authors and based around these health-system categories. These categories are also used to systematically summarize the findings, as shown in Annex 4. 5 WHO/IVB/12.11Table 1: Classification of practices, facilitators and barriers studied in this review Group classification Description of the group* Sub-group classification Service delivery \"Management and organization of inputs and services to ensure access to safe and quality\" hepatitis B birth dose vaccination \"across different locations and over time\" (9) Access to a trained health worker Linkages between immunization and maternity and newborn care services Integration with, and private health servicesLinkages between immunization and community postnatal care services Demand for vaccination: community characteristics; customs; knowledge; attitudes, and health-seeking behaviours Quality improvement activities, local policies and guidelines Health workforce Actions taken to manage the health workforce involved in hepatitis B birth dose programmes, including \"addressing entry into and exit from the workforce and improving the distribution and performance of the existent workforce\" (9) Knowledge, attitudes and training Delineation of responsibilities Guidelines and protocols Task-shifting Payment and incentives Medical products, vaccines and technologiesActions to ensure equitable access to hepatitis B birth dose vaccines of \"assured quality, safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness\" (9) Procurement, supply and distribution systems Vaccine storage and access to the cold chainVaccine delivery technologies Vaccine presentation Health information systems(HIS)The \"production, analysis, dissemination and use of reliable and timely information\" related to hepatitis B birth dose vaccination (9) Monitoring performance, equity and scale-up Mother and child registries Vaccination records Estimation of coverage Birth notification Linkages with other health databases Financing Actions to \"raise sufficient funds to ensure access to the hepatitis B birth dose vaccine, and that people do not incur financial catastrophe or impoverishment from payment\" for the vaccine (9) Cost-effectiveness of vaccination strategies Funding for birth dose programmesCost to recipient for vaccination Leadership and governance The government's role in guiding, overseeing and regulating hepatitis B birth dose programmes (9) Central policies and guidelines Central communications and information Political commitment * Descriptions of the groups are based on the WHO building blocks framework for health systems.Practices to improve coverage of the hepatitis B birth dose vaccine 62.3 Appraisal of the evidence Each of the papers included in the review were independently appraised by both reviewers. The quality of evidence from randomized control trials (RCTs), observational and qualitative studies was assessed using quality-assessment tools developed by the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) 2, and that from intervention studies assessed using a tool developed by the Centre for Evidence-Based Social Services.3 Grey literature was assessed based on criteria outlined in the box below (Box 1). Following appraisal of each study, Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria (described elsewhere: (10)) were used to provide a final scoring on the body of evidence available for each type of practice. Box 1: Appraisal criteria used to assess grey literature Type of resource Authors/institutions of standing in their field of expertise Clarity with which the methodology for the assessment is described Plausibility Potential for conflict of interest Description of study funding Involvement of the study sponsors in any aspect of the study Number of data sources used and use of data triangulation Given that the primary focus of this review was on practices to improve birth dose coverage, evidence on barriers and facilitators was not formally assessed but was taken into account in formulating recommendations. In cases where evidence came from more than one type of study, only the highest level of evidence available was assessed in GRADE tables. Based on GRADE criteria, the order of levels of evidence from highest to lowest was RCTs and systematic reviews, followed by intervention studies, observational studies and, lastly, any other type of evidence (for example reviews). Grey literature was not assessed in GRADE tables. Annex 3 provides an overview of the GRADE criteria and scoring methods used to appraise the evidence. 2 Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (www.casp-uk.net). 3 Tool available at http://libguides.mdx.ac.uk/content.php?pid=136038&sid=2095422.7 WHO/IVB/12.11Annex 4 provides a listing of the characteristics and content of included studies. 3.1 Settings and focus of included studies The broadest range of evidence comes from studies in China, Indonesia and the United States of America (USA). The table below summarizes the settings encompassed by this evidence base. No studies from Africa met the inclusion criteria. Although there is a large, long-running intervention trial for HBV control in the Gambia (11), no studies were found presenting experiences relating to strategies for increasing birth dose coverage. Table 2: Settings of included studies SettingNumber of publications included United States of America 21 China 11 Indonesia 8 Viet Nam 4 Australia 3 Philippines (the) 2 Papua New Guinea 2 Columbia 1 Micronesia (Federated States of) 1 Micronesia (Federated States of) and Marshall Islands (the) 1 India 1 Israel 1 Thailand 1 Tonga 1 Western Pacific Region 6 Worldwide 13. Overview of included studiesPractices to improve coverage of the hepatitis B birth dose vaccine 8Most papers provided evidence on practices, facilitators or barriers in the area of service delivery (n = 35) and governance and leadership (n = 22). Close to one third of the papers looked at issues related to medical products, vaccines and technologies (n = 19) and human resources for health (n = 19). The least examined components were health information systems (n = 14) and financing for the hepatitis B birth dose (n = 10). The majority of studies examined more than one type of practice/facilitator/barrier. 3.2 Varying definitions of birth dose The definition of birth dose varied within the literature included in this review, although the majority of papers (n = 21) used the WHO definition, of vaccination administered within 24 hours of birth. A considerable number of papers did not specify the timing, and used a definition of \"at birth\" (n = 17). Other definitions used were: within 12 hours of birth (n = 2, set in the USA); before discharge from health facility (n = 9); within 48 hours of birth (n = 2); within 72 hours of birth (n = 4); within 7 days of birth (n = 8, studies set in Indonesia), and on the day of delivery (n = 2). 3.3 List of included studies The table below lists the included studies and the health system sub-groups each addressed.

Of the 48 published articles, the most common study types were surveys (n = 24), and reviews (n = 7). There were also six cohort and five qualitative studies, three intervention studies, one cost-effective analysis, one RCT and one epidemiological report. Within the grey literature (n = 17), papers were mainly reports (n = 11) and workshop/ conference proceedings (n= 4). There was also one evaluation and one operational field manual. Quality appraisals showed wide variation, as is common for studies of health-service implementation. Most limitations related to study design and data analysis. Of the 24 surveys included in this review, eight collected data through self-administered questionnaires, with the potential for recall or self-reporting biases. In the only RCT, the method of randomization of villages and allocation concealment was not described. Several quantitative studies (n = 6) did not adjust for confounding factors in data analysis, with potential under- or over-estimation of the practice, facilitator or barrier discussed. Most of the evidence comes from studies undertaken in specific settings, which need to be noted when considering generalizability of their findings. For qualitative studies, there was rarely discussion of how variability within the studied sample may have influenced findings. Practices to improve coverage of the hepatitis B birth dose vaccine 12In the grey literature, three studies did not describe data analysis, two did not detail how participants were recruited and, in most, there was inadequate evidence to support the arguments or conclusions made. The biggest limitation identified across the several studies that reported on a range of practices, was their inability to attribute the relative contribution of each practice to improving coverage. We examined the applicability of combining studies and applying GRADE criteria to display recommendations in the form commonly used for guidelines on specific interventions. We also examined the use of Cochrane methods to combine qualitative data from systematic reviews (12). However, these techniques could only apply to a small subset of our review, displayed in Annex 5, for important practices. The large variability in the implementation descriptions we found meant that such approaches to evidence would unhelpfully limit our ability to derive meaningful recommendations, based on practices that expert opinion deemed likely to be effective. When considering the range of studies found, it is also important to note some limitations; our review was restricted to publications in English and our search of the grey literature was conducted by online searching and through author contacts. With this caveat, however, discussion with expert opinion (as defined in the 'Methods' section) does suggest that we have covered the most important likely sources of implementation evidence, including Chinese studies, most suited to inform the evidence base.13 WHO/IVB/12.11Findings are presented aligned with the WHO's health-system categories used in data analysis (see Section 2), with practices addressing community knowledge and attitudes treated separately from other service-delivery issues. Under each category, findings on barriers or facilitators are presented if relevant, with the main emphasis placed on those practices found to improve coverage of the birth dose. Odds ratios or measured changes in birth dose coverage are included, where these were available, but only to provide a general indication of the relative importance of any particular practice. Many effect estimates must be treated with caution as noted here, and in the Annexes. Where judgments are derived from expert opinion, this is indicated through referencing. These findings list practices beneficial for all settings, as well as options to consider for special situations (where practices are not universally beneficial, this is indicated in the description of the practice). As mentioned in the 'Methods' section, not all studies were graded for quality of evidence. Of those that were graded, all but one study (46) were of low or very low quality (see Annex 5). Despite the limitations of the available evidence, there is still sufficient information to recommend certain practices important to improved coverage of timely hepatitis B birth dose vaccination: these are highlighted in bold in the narrative below. 4.1 Service delivery arrangements 4.1.1 Increasing access to skilled care at the time of childbirth Births outside health facilities (home births) were associated with lower coverage of birth dose in seven studies, with lack of access to trained health staff as the critical barrier (13-18). In China, one survey found coverage of timely birth dose was only 13% for home births compared to 49% for births in township hospitals, 54% in higher-level hospitals and 59% in private clinics (14); another large survey across 31 provinces found 31% timely birth dose coverage among home births compared to 78% and 85% for births in township hospitals and county hospitals respectively (15). Access difficulties were highlighted by variable coverage in Tamil Nadu, India, with rural coverage measured at 3.5% compared to urban at 11% (19). Home births were cited as an important reason for low coverage (52%) for hepatitis B birth dose administered within seven days of birth in Cambodia (20). In Lombok, Indonesia, where over 90% of births were at home, only 5% of births were attended by nurses or midwives who could vaccinate (21).4. Practices that improve birth dose coveragePractices to improve coverage of the hepatitis B birth dose vaccine 14Increasing skilled attendance at birth, preferably in well-supported health facilities, is a critical part of improving birth dose coverage ( 22,23), requiring broader initiatives for maternal and newborn survival (24) and integration of birth dose vaccination into maternal and newborn care, as discussed below. 4.1.2 Integration of birth dose with maternal and newborn care in health facilities Provision of birth dose as part of the management of childbirth in health facilities has proved to be feasible in settings as varied as China (Province of Taiwan) (26), the United States (27), Oman (28), the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia (29). A number of specific practices that support this are documented in the evidence base and are discussed below. A local health-facility policy specifying birth dose vaccination was found to improve coverage in four studies. In a focused effort to improve birth dose in the Republic of the Philippines, hospitals with a copy of the hepatitis B vaccine vaccination policy were 4.7 (CI 1.2 - 18) times more likely to have more than 50% coverage with birth dose (30). This study did not control for confounding factors, implying that the size of the effect may have been over- or under-estimated. Recent studies in the United States also found local policies significantly associated with higher coverage; 87% compared to 38% without a policy (p < 0.001) in one site (31), and 41% compared with 15% for another (32), while an earlier study in Australia found comparable associations with hospital recommendations, 93% compared with 77% (33). The Australian study, however, was only undertaken in two urban hospitals and did not test for statistical significance in differences in coverage between the hospitals. Standing orders for administration of birth dose in the delivery room or postnatal ward are effective in improving coverage. In the Philippines study described above, hospitals with standing orders were 4.8 (CI 1.3 - 18.1) times more likely to have greater than 50% coverage, noting that this effect size is to be interpreted with caution, given the limitations noted above. In a quality improvement intervention in the USA, coverage of birth dose increased from 73% to 84% following implementation of a nursery order requiring physicians to provide birth dose vaccination, unless they actively 'opted out' (34). Similar gains were seen in Australia (33). Health-facility guidelines that prescribe the birth dose to \"follow birth within 24 hours\" rather than as \"prior to discharge\", helped improve timely vaccination in one hospital in Papua New Guinea (35). Interpretation of these effect sizes should be done with caution, as these studies did not fully control for confounding factors. Ensuring vaccine is available in the delivery room or postnatal ward is important to timely vaccination. In Tonga, this was one element seen as contributing to increased birth dose coverage (36) and, in a review of hospitals in Papua New Guinea, non-availability of birth dose vaccines in the delivery room was reported as the most common barrier to vaccination (35). Expert opinion noted the lack of cold-storage facilities as a contributor to low coverage in the Western Pacific Region (13,37), reported the effectiveness of storing vaccines in delivery rooms of public hospitals in Viet Nam (20), and supported the use of vaccine carriers to aid in this (3,35). Since the hepatitis B vaccine can be stored outside standard cold-chain arrangements (OCC) (38,39) there is potential for managed usage without refrigeration, now known as a controlled temperature chain (CTC), in peripheral health facilities. 15 WHO/IVB/12.11Studies in Viet Nam confirm this; a four district study saw an increase in coverage (from 45% to 73%) in health centres where the birth dose was stored OCC, equivalent to gains seen in hospitals (40), and single-dose vials stored OCC in community health centres for up to four weeks (41) were associated with increased coverage (45% to 89%) of birth dose administered within 72 hours (37,41). It should, however, be noted that two of these studies did not provide sufficient details on methods to fully support these estimates of effect (37,40). Another analysis in Viet Nam (42) confirmed the feasibility of OCC storage at peripheral health facilities, but found that this was not associated with higher coverage unless other arrangements (for example, to increase vaccinator numbers) were also in place. These factors, and the potential of CTC storage to reach home births, are discussed further in the sections below. Clear delineation of who is responsible to vaccinate that includes maternal health- care providers is discussed as a contributor in some of the literature. Expert opinion noted failure to give birth attendants responsibility for vaccination as a barrier (13), confirming findings from demonstration sites in Indonesia (21) and from Viet Nam, where restricting vaccination to public-health nurses was associated with limitation of coverage (42). In Tonga, timely vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine significantly outstripped bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin ( BCG) vaccination (also timed for birth) when delivery-room staff were delegated authority to give the hepatitis B vaccine (36). While having a birth attendant able to vaccinate is clearly important, assigning a public-health staff with coordination and facilitation roles is also worthwhile; having an assigned immunization nurse helped to increase coverage of timely birth dose from under 40% to over 80% in one hospital in Papua New Guinea (35), public-health nurses visit postnatal wards daily to vaccinate in Oman (28), and having a dedicated nurse to coordinate the birth dose vaccination campaign helped to increase coverage in the Federated States of Micronesia (43). In all these studies, confounding factors were not tightly controlled, and staff assignment is likely to be just one of a number of contributors to improving coverage. Positioning birth dose vaccination as part of essential newborn care and ensuring it does not interrupt urgent interventions is important to ensure the birth dose is provided appropriately ( 3); noting that vaccination should not precede other early care, such as resuscitation, keeping the newborn warm and establishment of breastfeeding. In the Philippines' successful hospital- and health-centre interventions for improving birth dose coverage (30), one facility developed an essential newborn care protocol which timed birth dose vaccination to take place after the first full breastfeed (44). Coordinated planning between immunization and maternal health staff in health facilities and in districts is critical to birth dose vaccination, as noted by expert opinion (22), with supporting descriptions of collaborations between immunization programmes and the maternal health department in Viet Nam (20,42), although no studies measured the impact of this. Experiences of improved coverage in Papua New Guinea and the Philippines clearly demonstrated the important role in sustaining coverage of structured health-facility assessments and local problem-solving and education, as well as repeated follow-up (30,35). Practices to improve coverage of the hepatitis B birth dose vaccine 164.1.3 Linkages between immunization and private health services Two studies reported on barriers related to birth dose delivered within private health services. In Viet Nam, coverage of birth dose delivered within 72 hours was lowest, at 47% (statistical testing not reported), in the province with the highest percentage of deliveries in private facilities. This was attributed to weak linkages between private health facilities and the national EPI (42), although rigorous evidence was not provided to support this conclusion. In multivariate analyses of findings from a survey undertaken among 41 589 children in the United States, infants with a public provider were 1.3 (CI 1.2 - 1.5) times more likely to receive the birth dose compared to infants with private providers (45). 4.1.4 Reaching infants born outside health facilities Intervention trials and observational studies in China, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines and Viet Nam, have demonstrated that, while difficult, it is possible to reach infants born outside health facilities with birth dose vaccination (noting that the definitions of timeliness varied in these studies). Effective practices to achieve this are presented below. Home visits to provide timely vaccination after home birth were found to be more effective than requiring families to bring newborns to health facilities in all studies that compared these modes. In a RCT in China, the two study arms with village health workers visiting homes saw a significantly greater increase in birth dose coverage, from 11.3% (CI 7.3% - 15.2%) to 67.8% (CI 5.9%) to 77.3% (CI 71.5% - 83%) respectively, than did the group relying on vaccination in township clinics, which saw a lower coverage increase from 8% (CI 4.7% - 11.2%) to 57.9% (CI 50.3% - 65.4%) (46,47). In urban Manila, home visits by community staff were part of an intensive programme that saw timely birth dose coverage increase from 17% to 86% for infants born at home (30,48). A number of analyses in Viet Nam, that included home visits for vaccination, all saw significant increases in birth dose coverage to above 80% where this was included in the strategy (37,39,40,42). Apart from the China RCT, confounding factors were not tightly controlled in these studies, and other factors, in addition to home visits, may have contributed to improving coverage. Integration of birth dose with home visits for other postnatal care is an alternative to the vaccination-specific home visits discussed above. This option for service delivery has been examined in three studies in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. Creati and colleagues' review described various projects integrating birth dose administration within larger packages of postnatal care services delivered by village midwives. In one project, after five years of implementation (no baseline provided), coverage of birth dose for infants born at home was at 39% for within seven days of birth (noting Indonesian policy allowed timely birth dose up to seven days) (21); in an earlier initiative, in three provinces, coverage increases varied \u2014 in Lombok from 33% to 83%, in Mataram from and in Sumbawa from 3% to 90% (49). In Papua New Guinea, a similar district feasibility trial in East Sepik Province estimated local coverage increase at 74% coverage for home births compared with 93% coverage for health-centre births (50). A WHO/UNICEF guideline on general community-based postnatal care recommends that a home visit should take place within 24 hours of a home birth (51). 17 WHO/IVB/12.11Vaccine storage OCC, careful pregnancy tracking and the use of Uniject were also key contributors to reaching infants born at home. OCC usage, including the provision to maintain the vaccine for up to 30 days outside of standard cold-chain arrangements (3) and Uniject, are discussed further under 'Medical Technologies', and pregnancy tracking is discussed under 'Health Information Systems'. 4.2 Health workforce considerations 4.2.1 Health-care provider knowledge and attitudes Five studies and a WHO operational manual provided evidence that health workers' knowledge and attitudes are barriers or facilitators to improving coverage of the birth dose. In hospital assessments in Papua New Guinea (3,35) and in peripheral health facilities in China (52) inadequate knowledge among staff was reported as a barrier to achieving higher coverage of timely birth dose vaccination. Health staff perceptions and attitudes were found to be important determinants of willingness to vaccinate newborns. In the United States, health provider resistance to vaccination, including perceptions that population health risks were low, were barriers to timely birth dose in surveys of 296 hospital nurseries (53) and of a random sample of 773 hospitals. In the latter survey, coverage with birth dose vaccination prior to discharge was at 38% for hospitals that reported physician resistance, compared to 62% of hospitals where there was no physician resistance (p < 0.05) (54). The findings from this study were based on self-reported data, and thus subject to bias. Also in the USA, physician's belief in the importance of birth dose was a statistically significant determinant of higher coverage (55). Midwife concern for the autonomy of their clients in vaccination choices, when accompanied by lack of awareness of the rationale for vaccine timing in preventing perinatal transmission, was seen as a barrier to birth dose in a qualitative study in Australia (56). Unspecified newborn safety concerns among village midwives in rural Indonesia (Lombok), who feared blame for perceived adverse events, was reported to impede administration of the birth dose (21). 4.2.2 Health-care worker education and training practices and their impact Five studies reported evidence on effective training practices. Education on the epidemiological rationale for birth dose is associated with higher coverage. The RCT in China that explored the feasibility and effectiveness of OCC strategies found an association between education of township health workers, village doctors and midwives, with a significantly decreased risk that parents would report not being informed about the importance of timely birth dose. This was seen most strongly for those whose infant was delivered in the hospital (46). In an evaluation of the impact of training for urban health facility and outreach staff in the Philippines, coverage of timely birth dose increased from 19% before the training intervention to 74% during the two months after the training. For infants born at home, coverage increased from 17% to 86%, and for infants born in lie-in clinics, from 26% to 75%. Hospitals with neonatal practitioners who had undergone training were 14.4 (CI 3.1 - 87.9) times more likely to have over 50% coverage of birth dose administered before. The training impact is striking, although it is noted that this study did not have a control group and not all confounding factors could be controlled (30). Papua New Guinea researchers noted the importance of including a staff education Practices to improve coverage of the hepatitis B birth dose vaccine 18component as part of hospital assessments, qualitatively linking this to better coverage (35). In both these situations, the documented training content covered: diseases caused by HBV and the importance of early vaccination; vaccine and cold-chain management; giving the vaccination safely, and common misconceptions regarding birth dose administration, including false contraindications. Within the grey literature, supervision and training of health workers, including village doctors and birth attendants, in the province of Qinghai, China was given as a reason for improved coverage of timely birth dose from 40% in 2004 to 70% at the end of 2005 (52,57). The experience of the Philippines emphasized the critical contribution of supportive supervision and follow-up to any training outcomes (48). The role of supervision in improving primary health-care services has been the subject of a recent Cochrane systematic review (58), finding a modest effect on health-worker practices and knowledge, albeit based on studies rated as low, to very low, for quality of evidence. 4.2.3 Task-shifting As noted above, the service delivery evidence for increasing coverage in health facilities includes tasking of delivery room or postnatal care staff with vaccination responsibilities. Expert opinion notes, that such staff usually provide other injections at birth, such that formal task-shifting (defined as the shifting of health-care tasks from more specialized to less specialized health-care providers) is not required. Task-shifting may be considered as an option for reaching infants born at home. Studies in Indonesia (21), China (46) and Viet Nam (59) involved training some peripheral health staff who had not previously provided vaccination injections. One study, in order to reach home births in remote villages, trained lay health workers (known as village health volunteers) to provide birth dose vaccination, attributing much of the gains in coverage in that difficult environment to this cadre (50). Presentation of the vaccine in Uniject (discussed below) was an important facilitator, and expert consensus suggests that this is the only form of vaccination device suitable for use by trained lay health workers (39,60). A Cochrane systematic review of 82 studies on the effect of lay health workers (61) demonstrates their benefit in promoting immunization uptake and postnatal care, such as breastfeeding, in addition to other community health activities. 4.3 Medical products and technologies relevant to birth dose 4.3.1 Vaccine distribution and storage systems Three studies (16,35,62) and two reports (18,63) described unavailability of the birth dose vaccine as a barrier to improving coverage, while two reports stated that poor management of vaccine supplies and auto-disposal syringes in China was a reason for low coverage of timely birth dose (18,52). As noted under 'Service Delivery', birth dose is improved by making appropriate vaccine storage as close to the location of birth as possible, both in the cold chain using refrigerators, or vaccine carriers and OCC. This was well demonstrated by the coverage gains in studies in Viet Nam (40,42) and the RCT in China (additional detail below) (46,47), and noted as an essential facilitator for home-based vaccination in Papua New Guinea (50). In all these settings, storage of the vaccine under managed OCC conditions was associated with the 19 WHO/IVB/12.11best coverage gains for settings where home births remain common. Other work, beyond the scope of this review, has demonstrated the safety and efficacy of hepatitis B vaccine storage outside the standard cold chain, as part of a CTC (39). Expert opinion on effective CTC practices requires vaccines to have a vaccine vial monitor (VVM) attached to detect heat exposure, and that vaccines remain outside of standard cold-chain arrangements for no more than 30 days (3 ). Experimental work is currently underway to validate and extend the flexibility of deployment of hepatitis B vaccine in a CTC (64). 4.3.2 Vaccine presentations Uniject is a compact pre-filled auto-disable injection device that is simpler to use than standard needles and syringes (65). WHO and other international organizations support its use (66,67) for vaccines and medicines, including hepatitis B vaccine. The Indonesian Government offers birth dose nationally in the Uniject presentation. Studies described above have explored its use when combined with storage OCC in delivering the birth dose vaccine, as noted above, in China, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Viet Nam. Two studies in particular attest to the presentation in Uniject as an option worth considering, given its clear association with improved birth dose coverage in situations where home births are common. The China RCT compared, in rural counties of Hunan Province, single-dose vial vaccines stored within the cold chain and administered in township hospitals (Group 1), with single-dose vial vaccines stored OCC in villages and administered by village health workers in homes (Group 2) and with Uniject vaccines stored OCC and administered by village health workers in homes (Group 3). Compared to coverage levels at the start of the study, coverage of timely birth dose increased from 8% (CI 4. 7% - 11.2%) to 57.9% (CI 50.3%-65.4%) in Group 1, 11.3% 7.3% - 15.2%) to 67.8% (CI 61.5% - 74.2%) in Group 2 and from 6.8% (CI 4.1% - 5.9%) to 77.3% (CI 71.5% - 83%) in Group 3 (p < 0.05 for differences in coverage between groups). These data indicate that the highest increase in coverage was experienced with birth dose delivered in Uniject devices OCC ( 46,47). One study provides additional evidence relating solely to the use of Uniject in the delivery of the birth dose vaccine in Indonesia. After two years of using Uniject devices to deliver the birth dose vaccine, coverage of birth dose within seven days of birth increased from 68% to 80% in the province of West Nusa Tenggara, from 0% to 86% in Yogyakarta and from 0% to 38% in East Java (68). This study did not differentiate the Uniject effect from the contribution of other hepatitis B birth dose vaccination practices which were simultaneously implemented in improving coverage. Monovalent hepatitis B vaccine in single-dose or multi-dose presentations is a requirement for birth dose, as combination vaccines should not be given at birth (1). Barriers and practices related to presentation of the birth dose vaccine were described in one study and one report of proceedings from a WHO Western Pacific Regional Office meeting held in 2007. In Indonesia, reluctance to open 10-dose vials of birth dose vaccines to vaccinate a few infants, due to concerns about wastage, was reported as a barrier to administering the birth dose (21). To overcome such challenges, single-dose vials for the birth dose vaccine were used in public hospitals in Viet Nam \u2014 a practice which was reported to help increase timely birth dose coverage in the hospitals (20). Expert consensus suggests that single-dose vials are more suitable for outreach for home-based vaccination (as usually only one birth can be accessed per visit), or settings with low volumes of births (3,48,69).Practices to improve coverage of the hepatitis B birth dose vaccine 204.4 Health-information system considerations for birth dose 4.4.1 Birth registries Four papers, one survey, one qualitative and survey study and two reports, suggested that registration in various population registries was important to estimate the target population for birth dose, and therefore also important for improved coverage. Expert consensus generally, and a report from China specifically, identified mobile and migrant populations, who may not be well tracked by local information systems, as challenging to vaccinate with the birth dose (18). In a study in Zhejiang province, China, infants from households that were registered with the local authorities were 2.7 (CI 1.8 - 4.1) times more likely to be vaccinated than infants from migrant families who were not registered (70). Registration of pregnant women was listed as a contributor to increased overall coverage (40% to 70%) and home birth coverage (20% to 60%) between 2004 and 2005 in Qinghai Province of China (52). 4.4.2 Birth notification and pregnancy tracking In Viet Nam, a study found that meticulous tracking of pregnancies and births by village and community health workers helped to improve coverage of the birth dose. In two districts where pregnancies were tracked, coverage of birth dose administered within 72 hours was 97% and 90%, compared to 87%, 52% and 45% in districts where there was no tracking (42). Differences in coverage were not tested for statistical significance, nor were confounding factors controlled. Three papers in Indonesia mentioned the role of birth notification in improving coverage for home births. In the hepatitis B birth dose immunization project carried out in Lombok between 1987 and 1991, written and verbal birth notification systems were used to ensure that health workers visited homes of newborns soon after birth to administer the vaccine (21,71). Cadres of the Indonesian village women's movement (PKK) and traditional birth attendants relayed information about births, and information was then given to vaccinators during their weekly visits to the village. Other mechanisms also evolved, such as vaccinators actively seeking newborns, and direct notifications of births to vaccinators by traditional birth attendants (TBAs), midwives and local community members. Although no data on baseline or endline coverage of birth dose was provided, coverage of birth dose in the study population (administered within seven days of birth) was reported at 95% in 1989 and 1991 (71). In the Healthy Start programme that followed (1990-1997) in Lombok, TBAs used colour-coded cards to notify midwives about births, which then prompted them to visit homes and administer the birth dose (72). 4.4.3 Vaccination records, monitoring and reporting of vaccine coverage Three studies provide evidence on the importance of incorporation of birth dose within vaccination records to improving birth dose coverage. In the United States, difficulties in transferring vaccination records to primary physicians created a barrier to birth dose (53) and, in another survey, clinicians who perceived difficulties in tracking vaccinations were less likely to administer birth dose vaccination (55). In China, children who lacked an immunization registration book or card were 0.6 times less likely to be vaccinated with timely birth dose (p < 0.0001) (14). In the Federated States of Micronesia, use of existing vaccination records and forms to report on hepatitis B vaccination was noted as a factor contributing to increased coverage of hepatitis B vaccination (43).21 WHO/IVB/12.11Expert consensus provides guidance on coverage reporting. The WHO Western Pacific Region has worked to improve country monitoring of birth dose through national systems and improvements in the Joint Reporting Form. It is important that these clearly identify time of vaccination in relation to birth by defining a birth dose as within 24 hours, and/or noting the date of vaccination in relation to date of birth. WHO also recommends serological surveys of HBV prevalence as useful options for establishing baselines and monitoring of programmes, and these have been an important component of Western Pacific Region regional strategies to control HBV (1,23). 4.5 Influence of vaccine financing on birth dose coverage The cost-effectiveness of birth dose vaccination or hepatitis B vaccination in general is well documented (1); hence here we present only those studies which show a link between financing arrangements and improved coverage. 4.5.1 Funding for birth dose programmes Three papers, one study set in the USA and two reports on Chinese immunization programmes, mentioned that funding-related issues were barriers to improving coverage of the birth dose. In China, the barrier was simply due to insufficient funding, particularly for operational activities (18,52). In the USA, a sample of hospital nurseries reported not offering the birth dose to newborns because of difficulties in obtaining reimbursement for it from public programmes (53). A multi-site study in Indonesia assessed incremental costs of various strategies aiming to provide birth dose in peripheral facilities and the home. It found that service delivery costs were higher where community staff needed to travel to collect vaccines, and lower when vaccines were stored at the most peripheral point possible (42). Uniject is more expensive than other presentations; however one study in Indonesia suggested that it is cost-effective when the alternative is multi-dose vials with a wastage rate of 33% (68). At present, there is little evidence providing detail on the financial implications of maximising coverage, in either our systematic review or in expert consensus. 4.5.2 Minimizing costs to families User fees for birth dose were reported as a reason for low coverage in China in a study conducted before user fees were removed (62). Paediatrician perceptions of increased cost, including reduced options for insurance reimbursement, were significantly associated with reduced birth dose vaccination in the USA (55). The response rate in this study, however, was low, and association was only tested in bivariate and not multivariate analyses. Four papers stated that removal or reduction of user fees for birth dose vaccination helped to improve coverage of the birth dose. In China, coverage of timely birth dose increased to 76% in 2002, with the halving of user fees for vaccination cited as a contributing factor (57). When vaccination was provided free-of-charge to all newborns in select provinces, average coverage of timely birth dose also increased (from 47% to 89% in township hospitals and from 61% to between 90% and 97% in city province hospitals) between 1998/1999 and 2005 (14). When birth dose administration was subsequently made free for all infants across China, coverage was found to have increased in rural areas \u2014 from within a range of 18% to 50% in 1993-1994 to 84% to 97% after 2005 (exact year not provided) (73). In the Republic of Korea, a high coverage of the birth dose in 2007, at 95% of newborns vaccinated before discharge, was partly attributed to the fact that vaccination had been covered under the National Insurance Act since 2002 (20).Practices to improve coverage of the hepatitis B birth dose vaccine 224.6 Addressing community concerns or lack of knowledge regarding birth dose 4.6.1 Family knowledge and practices influence birth dose coverage Five studies in our review highlight important family knowledge, customs and attitudes that can determine birth dose coverage. A report from Indonesia, and a survey undertaken among 3390 parents or guardians in four provinces in China, stated that parents' low awareness of the birth dose vaccine and its importance were reasons for low coverage and uptake of the vaccine ( 14). In multivariate analysis of findings from the survey, children whose parents did not know that the birth dose should be given within 24 hours of birth were 0.62 times less likely to be vaccinated compared to children whose parents did know (p < 0.01). Parents' perception that the birth dose was not required was also reported as a barrier to receipt of the birth dose in three papers (42,74,75). Higher incomes and education predisposes families to birth dose in China, where in Zhejiang Province infants from high-income families were 2.3 (CI 1.3 - 2.9, p < 0.05) times more likely to be vaccinated compared to infants from low-income families. Similarly, infants whose mothers had college or higher-level education were 2.8 (1.1 - 7.3, p < 0.05) times more likely to be vaccinated compared to infants whose mothers had middle-school education (70). The opposite trend is found in Israel and the USA, possibly for different reasons, as discussed in section 4.6.2 below. In a qualitative study among 48 mothers in four provinces of Viet Nam, traditional practices of sequestering newborns at home during the first month of delivery was reported as a reason for infants not being vaccinated with the birth dose (42) and this was also reported for Indonesia (21). The impact of this barrier has not been quantified, although the practice is noted as adding weight to the potential value of home visits for postnatal care (51). 4.6.2 Fear of adverse events or harm and parental refusal of vaccination Fear of adverse events or harm was a barrier documented in several papers (14,74,75). Among the parents of 1075 children who did not receive timely birth dose in a Chinese survey, 16% stated this was because of fear of an adverse event (14). In two reports from Viet Nam, public anxiety due to deaths of newborns following vaccination with the birth dose was stated as the reason for a decrease in coverage of timely birth dose from 64.3% in 2006 to 29% by the end of 2007 (63) and to 20% by the end of 2008 (59). Coincidental death is likely to be a higher risk with birth dose than other vaccines due to the higher risk of death in the first few days of life (76). Eight studies from the USA examined the impact of changes in national recommendations in 1999 in response to concerns regarding hypothetical and subsequently disproven adverse effects of thiomersal 4 content in the vaccine, particularly for a newborn. Recommendations were changed so that 'low-risk infants' would not receive the birth dose. Two months later, a thiomersal-free vaccine was made available. All studies, 4 It is important to note that continued worldwide study and scrutiny has failed to document actual safety concerns with thiomersal. Thiomersal-containing vaccines remain prequalified by WHO as they continue to satisfy all reviews of safety and quality, as documented by the WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety.23 WHO/IVB/12.11some which looked at state-wide and others at nationwide samples of newborns, found that birth dose coverage decreased for all infants during the policy change and remained lower than pre-July 1999 levels, even after recommendations were reinstated, not returning to previous levels until after approximately one year (27,45,54,77-80). We failed, however, to find additional evidence that parental fears are particularly linked to the fact that it is a newborn who is being vaccinated, as opposed to an older infant. Large multivariate analyses from the USA, regarding families with lower birth dose coverage despite good access, suggest that they are of higher socio-economic status, higher income, higher education and, more likely to be urban (32,31,45). In all cases, the effect sizes, though statistically significant, were relatively small and it seems likely that this represents the small sub-set of parents who refuse vaccination in general, rather than birth dose specifically. Similar findings were reported in an Israeli study, where mothers who did not give consent for vaccination were of a higher income or education level than mothers who did give consent, and this group were also less likely to intend to comply with the full series of hepatitis B vaccination (74). The review of Indonesian projects by Creati and colleagues reviewed qualitative evidence for this and concluded that, in that setting characterized by high home-birth rates, parental refusal or distrust was a minor barrier, especially when compared with health-system barriers (21). In multivariate analyses of findings from a survey of 2632 children in Zhejiang Province in China, parents' satisfaction with immunization services was a factor in improving uptake of the birth dose; infants whose families were satisfied with services were two times (CI: 1.5 - 4.3, p < 0.05) more likely to be vaccinated compared to infants whose families were not satisfied (70). This study looked at multiple vaccines, including the birth dose vaccine, and so it is possible that findings may have been different had results from birth dose vaccination only been analysed. 4.6.3 Communication practices for improved birth dose coverage Successful national commitments to HBV control (discussed below) have noted the importance of community education efforts in various settings, including China (17), Taiwan, China (26), the Federated States of Micronesia (43) and the Philippines (25), but these descriptions do not address the specifics of communications for newborn vaccination. One report does provide evidence of a public education programme aimed at increasing awareness about the hepatitis B birth dose; in Qinghai Province in China, communication activities were reported to have contributed to an increase in timely birth dose coverage from 40% in 2004 to 70% in 2005 (52). The possibility of coincidental newborn death, and other examples in Europe where unvalidated and broader community concerns in relation to hepatitis B vaccine have been raised (81,82), demonstrate the need for birth dose programmes to prepare communications for rapid responses to adverse perceptions. Expert opinion has suggested the use of trustworthy modelling to estimate the expected number of newborn deaths, such as that by Black and colleagues (83), as a basis for pre-emptive communication strategies.Practices to improve coverage of the hepatitis B birth dose vaccine 24The Viet Nam experience (59) can help inform these, as can more general guides to immunization communication (84), UNICEF's communications framework guides5 and broader work to improve public confidence in vaccines (85), which is also discussed below. 4.7 Leadership and governance Of the 21 studies that provided evidence about leadership and governance issues, the majority focused on policies and guidelines related to the birth dose. Those at national or state level are discussed here and those at health-facility level under 'Service Delivery'. A central policy which mandates that all newborns be vaccinated with the birth dose is associated with high coverage and is an option for consideration. In the Republic of the Marshall Islands, coverage of birth dose among children born before implementation of a universal policy on birth dose vaccination was 29%, compared to 79% for children born after the policy was implemented (p < 0.001) (29). In a nationwide survey in the United States, 84% of infants in states with a universal policy were vaccinated with the hepatitis B birth dose compared to 58% of infants born in states without a universal policy (p < 0.001) (31). In a survey of American paediatricans, 80% of paediatricians based in a state with a universal vaccination policy administered the birth dose as opposed to less than 50% of paediatricians in states with no universal policy (p < 0.001) (55). In a third American survey, median coverage of the birth dose was 65% (CI: 21% - 83%) in vaccination programmes that had a universal policy for birth dose vaccination compared to 43% (CI: 10% - 65%) for programmes that did not have a policy (p < 0.05) (86). Three of these studies, however, did not control for confounding factors (29,55,86) and one was based on self-reported data (31). Clear national guidance defining timely birth dose as within 24 hours of birth is important. In Indonesia, the national policy statement that allowed 'birth dose' within seven days of birth was felt to contribute to the fact that only 16% home births in one project were covered within 24 hours, although more than double that many were vaccinated by day seven (21). By 2009, in response to the Western Pacific Region's regional strategy, a number of countries were recorded as having changed guidance so as to conform to the 24-hour definition of a birth dose, including Mongolia (previously defined as within 24-48 hours), the Philippines (previously first dose was at six weeks) and Viet Nam (previously had been within seven days) (25). Unnecessarily stringent restrictions contraindicating vaccination can form a barrier. In Viet Nam, out-dated policies on vaccination of underweight or sick neonates was a reason for delayed vaccination (42), while in China, strict standards on vaccine contraindications meant that premature or low-birth-weight infants were not receiving timely birth dose (18). 5 For example, at https://sites.google.com/site/commframe/annexes/annex-2.25 WHO/IVB/12.11Endorsing vaccine use beyond the standard cold chain (using a CTC) and accrediting new vaccinators can help extend programme reach. In countries across the Western Pacific Region, a lack of guidelines on storing vaccines beyond the standard cold chain, and on explicit vaccine labelling, was another reported barrier to improving coverage of timely birth dose vaccination ( 20). Examples from Viet Nam and Indonesia cited above represent settings where government policy attempts to overcome this to reach newborns in difficult settings (23,25). Strong central communications to support public confidence in vaccines is essential. The restoration of birth dose coverage in the USA, following the thiomersal-related pause in 1999, required clear national guidance (27). A critical role for specialist societies, particularly paediatric societies, was noted in this process ( 87). The importance of preparatory communication strategies that anticipate public concerns was discussed in the section above, although at present there are no practice examples specific to birth dose. In countries without a universal birth dose, adding a birth dose is likely to require steps very similar to those for the introduction of a new vaccine, especially if (as is common) existing older infant hepatitis B vaccine is provided as part of a combination vaccine presentation. In these situations, generic WHO guidance on new vaccine introduction (88) and practices is documented at the WHO new and underutilized vaccines implementation website. 6 6 At http://www.who.int/nuvi/en/Practices to improve coverage of the hepatitis B birth dose vaccine 26although the evidence base is not large, as is common in questions relating to implementation of health services in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), there is sufficient evidence to support the production of guidance documents on improving birth dose coverage at global, regional and national levels. Box 2 below provides a summary of the practices deemed to be effective in improving coverage of birth dose vaccination, based on this review of the evidence. The evidence for effective practices has been broadened considerably through publications in recent years and now extends beyond the earlier demonstration sites in China, Indonesia and Viet Nam. There are studies specific to the implementation of hepatitis B birth dose vaccination across a range of LMIC and higher-income settings that demonstrate the effectiveness of practices within national planning and policy, district planning, implementation within childbirth care in health facilities, reaching newborns born at home, health-worker training and improved health information systems. Improving birth dose coverage requires intervention across all areas of the health system and, for certain important practices, guidance will need to rely on more general evidence for effective implementation of immunization programmes. As noted in this review, such areas include preparatory communication strategies that plan for public concerns and the local costing of strategies to scale-up birth dose within and beyond health facilities. One important step is the alignment, at international and national levels, of birth dose vaccination advice within general guidance documents for maternal and newborn health care, including those that provide support on community-based postnatal care. Continued implementation research, particularly to document country experiences of effective practices to increase routine coverage and integration of services, will help further build the evidence base in the future. Lastly, in countries without a universal hepatitis B birth dose, adding a birth dose is likely to require steps very similar to those for the introduction of a new vaccine, even if hepatitis B for older infants is already in use. For these settings, general resources from WHO and its partners on the introduction of new vaccines will be useful to supplement guidance specific to the birth dose derived from the evidence base above.5. Conclusion27 WHO/IVB/12.11Box 2: Effective practices for improving coverage with hepatitis B birth dose vaccine Service delivery arrangements Increasing access to skilled care at the time of childbirth. Integration of birth dose with maternal and newborn care in health facilities by: a local health-facility policy specifying birth dose vaccination; standing orders for administration of birth dose in delivery room or postnatal ward; ensuring vaccine is available in the delivery room or postnatal ward; clear delineation of who is to vaccinate that includes maternal health providers; positioning birth dose vaccination as part of essential newborn care in a way that does not interrupt urgent interventions; coordinated planning between immunization and maternal health staff in health facilities and in districts, including supportive health-facility assessments. Linkages between immunization and private services providing childbirth care. Where infants are born outside health facilities, considering options such as: home visits to provide timely vaccination; integration of birth dose with home visits for other postnatal care; vaccine storage outside the standard cold chain in a CTC; careful community-based pregnancy tracking. Health workforce considerations Addressing health-care providers' lack of knowledge and particular attitudes and perceptions towards newborn vaccination. Well-structured health-worker training, including education on perinatal transmission, backed up by frequent follow-up and supportive supervision. Consideration options for task-shifting to reach populations difficult to access. Medical technologies relevant to birth dose Distribution and storage arrangements that utilize the potential for keeping vaccine outside the standard cold chain, positioning it as close to the birth place as possible. The potential use of Uniject by community-based health-care providers. Ensuring monovalent hepatitis B vaccine in single-dose or multi-dose presentations. Health information system strengthening practices Birth registries and community birth notification, including tracking home births. Incorporation of birth dose and its timing within vaccination records. Accurate definition of timely birth dose in coverage reporting. Considering options for sero-surveys for establishment of need and for monitoring. Financing arrangements influencing birth dose coverage Adequate funding for birth dose programmes, with consideration of transport efficiencies for distribution to the periphery. Minimizing costs to families. Addressing community concerns or lack of knowledge regarding birth dose Responding to low awareness of the birth dose vaccine and its importance. Considering traditional practices of sequestering newborns. Addressing fear of adverse events, including planning for the risk of coincidental newborn death or disease. Responding to parental refusal of vaccination. Leadership and governance practices A national policy for universal newborn vaccination. Clear national guidance defining timely birth dose as within 24 hours of birth. Removing unnecessarily stringent restrictions contraindicating vaccination. Considering options for vaccine use in CTC and accrediting new vaccinators. Strong central communications to support public confidence in vaccines.

Geneva, World Health Organization, 2005 (WHO/IVB/05.18 ed.).35 WHO/IVB/12.11A1.1 Search strategy Four electronic databases, CINAHL+, Embase, Pubmed and Web of Science, were searched for relevant literature, published in English only. No time restrictions were placed on the date of publication; literature published up to March 2012 (in line with the timing of the review) was accepted for inclusion. Search strings comprised MESH terms and keywords, such as \"newborn\", \"infant\", \"hepatitis B\", \"birth dose\", \"vaccination\" and \"coverage\", combined with terms related to practices which increase, as well as facilitators and barriers to birth dose vaccination. Based on the premise that these practices, facilitators and barriers would revolve around health systems components, such as human resources or financing, the WHO Health Systems Building Blocks Framework (9) was used as a guide to identify relevant search terms. Additional published literature was identified by scanning the reference lists of included articles, and using the citation tracking functions of PubMed. To take into account delays between publication of articles and appearance in electronic databases, the online medical research guide, Amedeo, was searched for articles published in the months of December 2011 and January and February 2012, under the search category of \"vaccines\". Grey literature was identified by searching the websites of key organizations working in the area of hepatitis B vaccination, including: WHO, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), GAVI Alliance, Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH) and Technet 21. Search terms used comprised \"hepatitis B\", \"birth dose\", \"vaccine\", \"vaccination\" and \"immunisation/immunization\". The same terms were used to carry out a search in the Google search engine to identify additional grey literature. Expert opinions included in our findings were: professional contacts; authors of relevant publications, and discussions during the \"Technical Consultation on Birth Dose Vaccination for Prevention of Perinatal Transmission of Hepatitis B\", held 7-8 December 2010 and jointly convened by WHO, the Burnet Institute, Compass: the Women's and Children's Knowledge Hub for Health and the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory. Details of the participants and the agenda for this consultation are provided in Annex 2.Annex 1: Detailed MethodologyPractices to improve coverage of the hepatitis B birth dose vaccine 36A1.2 Search strategy used in Embase, Pubmed and Web of Knowledge Step 1 Child OR children OR infant* OR baby OR newborn OR neonat* Step 2 (Hepatitis B vaccines/administration and dosage*) OR (Immunization program*) OR (Training OR skills building OR staff responsibilities OR standards OR staffing OR human resource* OR health worker OR community health worker OR voluntary worker OR traditional birth attendant) OR (Home care service OR community care OR outreach OR home visit) OR (Cold chain OR cold temperature OR supply chain OR distribution) OR (Drug storage OR medicine storage OR vaccine storage OR Uniject) OR (Birth delivery AND health facility OR health centre OR health center) OR (Monitor* OR Regist* OR record OR data collection) OR (Organization OR organisation OR management OR integrated OR administration) OR (Immunization program* AND /economics OR costs OR cost analysis OR funds OR funding OR finance* OR financial resource*) OR (Immunization programmes* AND /standards OR immunization schedule) OR( knowledge OR attitudes OR practice* OR barriers OR obstacles OR determinants OR facilitators OR enablers OR policy) Step 3 Coverage OR birth dose OR hepatitis B vaccination OR hepatitis B immunization or hepatitis B immunization Step 4 #1 AND #2 AND #3 Limit: English language 1.

Given that the review questions revolved around issues related to implementation, and the lack of experimental studies in this field of research, no restrictions were placed on study design. However, only literature which related practices, facilitators and/or barriers to an outcome of birth dose coverage or birth dose uptake were included. Although the focus of this review is on birth dose delivered within 24 hours, literature that examined issues related to administration of the birth dose up to one week after birth was accepted to ensure that all relevant evidence was captured. Papers that studied multiple vaccines were also accepted, provided that one of the vaccines was the hepatitis B birth dose. Literature was excluded if: the focus was not on universal administration of the hepatitis B birth dose (we excluded studies of prenatal screening and targeted vaccination); the study was restricted to measurement of coverage, immunogenicity or efficacy of the vaccine, without data on determinants of vaccine coverage; there was no clear source(s) of evidence or a research method (for published studies); not in English; full-text version was not accessible. A1.4 Selection of the literature Two reviewers independently screened the titles identified from the searches of published literature. In this first stage, titles that were deemed as relevant by either reviewer were retained. Both reviewers then read the abstracts of the remaining titles. In this round, only abstracts judged as meeting the inclusion criteria by both reviewers were retained. In the final round of the selection process, full-text articles of the remaining titles, as well as of the titles deemed relevant but for which no abstract was available, were assessed by both reviewers. Full-text versions of grey literature titles that were found to be relevant from the searches were also assessed at this stage. Only published and grey literature that was judged as fulfilling the inclusion criteria by both reviewers were finally included in the review. Any disagreement between the reviewers was resolved through discussion. Figure A1 provides a summary of the results from the literature search and selection process. A total of 3676 titles were identified from the five databases. Export to Endnote X4 and removal of duplicates yielded a final total of 2899 exclusive titles. Screening of titles resulted in 470 abstracts eligible for review, of which 334 were excluded. Two relevant articles were identified from scanning references lists, giving 138 full-text articles for review, in addition to 26 grey literature papers. Of the 138 articles, six full-texts were not accessible so, in total, 158 full text papers were assessed. A final number of 48 published articles and 17 grey literature papers were judged as meeting the inclusion criteria and included in the review.

The criteria and scoring system adopted is detailed below. The original GRADE methodology has been adapted to suit the types of literature identified here, and the topic of this review. Two WHO publications, which used GRADE criteria to appraise evidence, have also been used as a guide to develop the scoring criteria.* For more information on GRADE, see http://www. gradeworkinggroup.org/index.htm.Annex 3: Grade criteria for appraising the evidence * Guidelines for the management of postpartum haemorrhage and retained placenta.

Does not examine the extent to which community-based birth dose notification had an effect on improving coverage of birth dose for home births \u2014 there is no comparator. 2 No serious imprecision determined even though confidence intervals or number of infants (denominator) not provided.93 WHO/IVB/12.11Providing birth dose vaccine free-of-charge Quality assessment Summary of findings Importance# of studiesDesign Limitations Inconsistency Indirectness Imprecision# of infantsIncrease in coverage (between 1998/1999 and 2005; between 1993/1994 and after 2005 for rural areas) Quality Township hospitalsCity & province hospitalsRural areas 34%* Very low Critical * This is the minimum increase in coverage as a range was provided, coverage was in the range of 18%-50% in 1993/1994 and 84%-97% after 2005 (year not specified). 1 Serious limitations because the study does not control for confounders and so cannot determine the extent to which providing birth dose vaccination free-of-cost had an effect on improving coverage of birth dose. 2 No serious imprecision determined even though confidence intervals or number of infants (denominator) not provided.Practices to improve coverage of the hepatitis B birth dose vaccine 94Family, Women's and Children's Health (FWC) World Health Organization 20, Avenue Appia CH-1211 Geneva 27 Switzerland E-mail: vaccines@who.int "}
