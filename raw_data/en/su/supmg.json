Pew applies a rigorous, analytical approach to improve public policy, inform the public, and invigorate civic life. 1 Overview Drug compounding is a long-standing practice wherein a pharmacist \"combines, mixes, or alters ingredients of a drug to create a medication tailored to the needs of an individual patient.\"1 While the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has the authority to enforce applicable federal laws over pharmacies, states remain the principal regulators of pharmacy practice, including pharmacy compounding activity. Relevant laws and regulations are updated at the discretion of each state and jurisdiction. This study, commissioned by The Pew Charitable Trusts and conducted by researchers from the University of Illinois at Chicago, assesses the national landscape of state policies on compounding sterile drugs\u2014such as medicines that are injected or infused into the body. Between 2012 and 2013, 2 an outbreak involving hundreds of patient illnesses and dozens of deaths linked to tainted compounded injections drove state and federal officials to re-examine oversight of sterile drug compounding, particularly when it exceeds traditional practice in scale and risk.3 However, until now there has been no single central repository for information describing policy and practice across states. This study collected data from publicly available websites and from a questionnaire on state oversight that was completed by representatives from 43 of the 51 state boards of pharmacy (50 states plus the District of Columbia) in spring and summer 2015. The study found that states vary significantly in their policies for sterile compounding. While some policy areas showed greater alignment across states, such as the application of recognized quality standards, others differed notably, including disparate systems to oversee out-of-state compounding pharmacies. Some states have updated their standards in the wake of the 2012-13 outbreak and to conform to new federal law. The Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013, among other reforms, added a new category of compounders called outsourcing facilities that can compound supplies of drugs without obtaining prescriptions. However, the state policy landscape remains fluid: New policies are not uniform. Some states are still working to advance change, and others have yet to act. This remains a transitional time for compounding drug policy in many states, which should be weighed in the interpretation of the findings of this study. Among the notable findings and themes of this research: About half of the respondents (representing 21 of 43 states, or 49 percent) reported that they required sterile compounding to fully conform to the widely recognized quality standards set by the U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention (USP) in its General Chapter <797> Pharmaceutical Compounding\u2014Sterile Preparations. Thirteen respondents (30 percent) reported that their states mandated at least some part of USP Chapter <797>. Just over half of respondents (representing 24 of 43 states, or 56 percent) reported that their states tracked the number of pharmacies that perform sterile compounding. The majority of respondents (representing 26 of 43 states, or 60 percent) said their states did not require pharmacies to report serious adverse events and reactions related to sterile compounding. Twenty-eight respondents (65 percent) said their states allowed pharmacies to compound without patient-specific prescriptions. Most of these states (21 of the 43 respondents, or 49 percent) had specific limits on this practice, but with varying degrees of restriction\u2014such as a narrow allowance for emergency veterinary use only, compared with a broader allowance for any drug that is not commercially available. State policies permitting compounding without a prescription for human use conflict with recently clarified federal law. Nine respondents (21 percent) said their state required pharmacies to have a separate license or registration to perform sterile compounding.2 Twelve respondents (28 percent) reported that when inspecting sterile compounding pharmacies in the state, they prioritized inspections for pharmacies where high-risk sterile compounding occurs. Sterile compounding sometimes takes place in physician offices or clinics, which are normally regulated by a state board of medicine. When asked, only one state reported that their state had a mechanism to track nonpharmacy locations where sterile compounding occurs, and only seven respondents (17 percent) reported that physician offices were held to the same compounding quality standards as pharmacies. The variations in sterile compounding policy across states suggest that an opportunity exists to review state oversight systems for potential weaknesses, and consequently to advance regulatory practices to better protect patients. This study is intended to provide helpful information to policymakers and stakeholders in pursuit of that goal. Background Traditional pharmacy compounding involves the specialized preparation of a drug tailored to the needs of an individual patient. Compounding is distinct from commercial drug manufacturing, in which standardized drug products are approved by FDA and produced on a large scale. Pharmacists may prepare customized drugs in a number of ways, such as by combining or diluting existing drugs, or creating a drug product from bulk active chemicals. Compounding is considered a fundamental skill for pharmacists, 4 and like other licensed health care professions, pharmacy practice is regulated by the state. State pharmacy law is typically enforced by a state board of pharmacy. 5 Meaningful quality standards are important for all forms of compounded drugs, including pills, syrups, and topical creams. But rigorous standards are critical for drugs that are injected or infused into the body, and therefore must be sterile to minimize the risk of infection. The preparation of sterile injectables and IV infusion products by a pharmacist or other practitioner emerged as a practice in the early 20th century primarily in the hospital setting, where those products were used. 6 However, as the complexity of sterile preparations increased and demand grew, outsourced sterile compounding became a commercial enterprise.7 Pharmaceutical manufacturers were among the first companies to enter the outsourced compounding services market in the 1980s and 1990s, establishing pharmacies to prepare sterile medications for hospitals. Other compounding pharmacies also began to supply doctors' offices and clinics. 8 Some of these outsourcers were providing supplies of compounded drugs without patient prescriptions, which created an oversight and enforcement challenge for FDA. 9 There was no explicit federal regulatory framework for compounding pharmacies, and the agency became increasingly concerned about appropriate oversight of businesses that looked more like manufacturers than traditional compounders. 10 In 1997, Congress introduced new federal policy on compounding as part of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act, adding Section 503A to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA). 11 Under this section, compounders must obtain a prescription for an individually identified patient in order to receive exemptions from several FDA requirements, including new drug approval processes, labeling with adequate directions for use, and adherence to FDA Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMPs). Among other provisions to distinguish compounding from commercial manufacturing, Section 503A prohibited compounders from \"advertising, promoting, or soliciting prescriptions.\" 12 However, soon after the passage of Section 503A, several pharmacies challenged the restrictions on advertising in court, claiming a free-speech violation. 13 This led to a series of conflicting rulings resulting in invalidation of the 3 law in some parts of the country. In 2001, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit upheld a lower court ruling that the advertising provision was unconstitutional and further said that the provision could not be separated from the rest of the section, rendering it inoperable. 14 In 2002, the Supreme Court affirmed this ruling and did not address whether the advertising provisions could be separated from the rest of the section, leaving the 9th Circuit's decision in place. 15 In response to the invalidation of Section 503A, FDA reissued a Compliance Policy Guide.16 The guide stated that FDA would generally defer to state boards of pharmacy to oversee traditional pharmacy compounding but would enforce federal drug law over entities that crossed the line into drug manufacturing based on certain criteria, such as offering compounded drugs for wholesale. 17 Later, in 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruled that the advertising restrictions were invalid but that the rest of Section 503A should remain in effect.18 This created additional ambiguity about the enforceability of federal law in different jurisdictions. Compounding practice across the U.S. became complex and diverse as states pursued varied regulatory approaches.19 FDA continued to harbor concerns regarding the quality and safety of compounded products. In 2001, the agency tested sterile preparations sold online by 12 compounding pharmacies for quality, purity, and potency. 20 They found that 34 percent of the 29 samples failed quality and safety tests, most frequently for potency. In contrast, the failure rate cited by FDA among commercial manufacturers was less than 2 percent.21 Between 1990 and 2005, the agency discovered more than 240 serious illnesses and deaths associated with compounded products.\u00b2\u00b2 It also stated that this estimate might be an underrepresentation because pharmacists and physicians were not required to report adverse events to FDA. 23 Between 2012 and 2013, 753 patients were sickened\u201464 of whom died\u2014during an outbreak of fungal meningitis and other infections attributed to tainted steroid injections made by a large compounding pharmacy center in Massachusetts. 24 A subsequent examination identified numerous other incidents involving over 300 adverse events, including 26 deaths since 2001.25 In the aftermath of the 2012-13 outbreak policymakers, including the U.S. Congress, and other groups moved to examine underlying issues around drug compounding and identify solutions. 26 Since the outbreak, FDA has conducted over 200 inspections of compounding facilities and issued approximately 60 warning letters.27 Congressional investigations identified several urgent issues related to (1) the need to distinguish between traditional compounding activities and those that resemble manufacturing; (2) reconsideration of appropriate oversight and quality standards for nontraditional compounding; and (3) the need for sufficient enforcement of standards by state and federal officials. Over the course of 2013, Congress developed legislation intended to address these concerns. On Nov. 27, 2013, the Drug Quality and Security Act (DQSA) was signed into law by President Barack Obama. 28 The law's first major component was the Compounding Quality Act (CQA). The CQA clarified the distinction between traditional compounding pharmacies, which prepare drugs pursuant to individual prescriptions to meet specific patient needs and are regulated under Section 503A of the FDCA, and companies selling supplies of compounded drugs without patient-specific prescriptions. These latter are now regulated as part of a new \"outsourcing facility\" sector under Section 503B and are required to meet stricter quality controls. FDA implementation of the law is active and ongoing. Following passage of the DQSA, Pew commissioned a report, \"Quality Standards for Large-Scale Sterile Compounding Facilities,\" 29 to review the differences between traditional compounding pharmacies and operations that supply compounded drugs without prescriptions on a larger scale. The report describes the stringent standards that are critical to ensuring drug quality and patient safety in facilities that make standing supplies of drugs with the potential to reach many thousands of patients.4 The CQA helped clarify that FDA has primary oversight of all commercial pharmaceutical manufacturing as well as the new outsourcing facility compounding sector, while states are primarily responsible for regulating the practice of pharmacy, including compounding by traditional pharmacies. FDA also retains authority to enforce applicable federal law over pharmacies. Each state has laws and regulations setting pharmacy standards and requirements, and addressing issues related to the authority pharmacies are granted to compound products for patients. But until now, there has been no single public repository for information describing state policies. This report aims to describe state oversight of sterile compounding practices using publicly available data, and information solicited from state regulatory bodies. The authors worked with each state to characterize current efforts to oversee sterile compounding, as well as anticipated policy changes in certain areas in response to the 2013 federal law. The Compounding Quality Act and New Outsourcing Facility Sector The Compounding Quality Act (CQA) created a new type of compounder known as an \"outsourcing facility\" (OF) under Section 503B of the FDCA. 30 In exchange for submitting to more stringent FDA oversight and adherence to formal CGMPs, OFs are permitted to sell unlimited quantities of compounded drugs without a prescription anywhere in the U.S. and are exempt from the drug approvals process. 31 OFs are subject to several requirements and limitations: They may not sell drugs through wholesalers32 and are not allowed to compound copies of drug products already on the market,33 including a drug made using an active ingredient that is part of an approved medicine, unless the product is on the drug shortage list. 34 Further, while OFs may take an FDA-approved drug out of its packaging and alter it when required for patient care, they may not compound using a bulk chemical active ingredient unless it is on an FDA list identifying bulk drug substances for which there is a clinical need. 35 Compounding at an OF must be done under the supervision of a licensed pharmacist,36 and OFs must also follow new labeling requirements (including the drug name, dosage form, and strength, and a statement that the drug is compounded), 37 report any adverse drug events to FDA,38 be inspected by FDA based on a set of risk factors,39 and pay FDA an annual fee.40 As of Oct. 29, 2015, 55 compounding entities had registered as outsourcing facilities.41 The CQA also reaffirmed the applicability of Section 503A of the FDCA by removing the contested advertising provisions. Section 503A stipulates that traditional pharmacies\u2014unlike OFs under 503B\u2014must compound based on an individual patient prescription, or in limited quantities (not defined) before the receipt of a prescription, in order to receive exemptions from CGMP, drug approval, and labeling requirements. 42 Section 503A also directs FDA to develop a memorandum of understanding with state regulatory agencies to address the inordinate interstate distribution of compounded drugs. 5 Methodology The research team convened an expert advisory panel (EAP) to develop a questionnaire aimed at eliciting current state practices related to the oversight of sterile compounding practices; this panel was also consulted on how to best approach each state and implement data collection. The EAP consisted of eight individuals with extensive experience in pharmacy and compounding practice, jurisprudence, regulation, research methods and questionnaire design, and pharmaceutical policy in the U.S. health care system. The research protocol was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The questionnaire was developed through an iterative process in which questions and response options were generated, revised for clarity, and grouped into themes. Each theme related to an aspect of sterile compounding practices oversight: quality standards, monitoring and enforcement, compounding without patient-specific prescriptions (also called office stock compounding), licensure, inspection and inspector training, and compounding in physician offices or clinics. Questionnaire items were reviewed and revised multiple times, with some items eliminated for reasons of redundancy and relevance. The final questionnaire consisted of 50 items. To minimize respondent burden, the research team pre-populated questionnaire responses from publicly available sources (i.e., state government websites on legislation and regulation) prior to contacting the state. These responses were then verified, or modified as needed, by the state contacts completing the questionnaire. A list of potential respondents was compiled with input from the EAP; it included experts in pharmacy compounding regulation for each state, primarily executive directors of state boards of pharmacies. These individuals were contacted by the research team via telephone to explain the purpose of the questionnaire, and they were invited to participate. The questionnaire was administered through either a Web-based version developed in Qualtrics (Provo, Utah), which was sent by the research team to the respondent via an email link, or by telephone with an interviewer-administered questionnaire, depending upon respondent choice. The questionnaire was shared with external reviewers for comment prior to deployment, and pilot tested with respondents from five state boards of pharmacy. Minimal modifications were made in response to feedback from external reviewers. Those who agreed to complete the Web-based questionnaire were sent a personal email summarizing the voluntary nature of participation, some information about the questionnaire, and a link to it. Follow-up reminder emails with the questionnaire link, and/ or telephone calls, were made to respondents every week until the questionnaire was completed, the respondent declined to participate, or the respondent did not complete the questionnaire before the final deadline had passed. Once the primary data collection phase ended, all respondents were sent a summary of their questionnaire responses for verification. For states not participating in the primary data collection phase, a copy of the questionnaire pre-filled with publicly available information was sent to the state board of pharmacy director, or equivalent. In early August 2015, state contacts were again asked to verify the accuracy of the information collected for their state and given two weeks to provide comments. 6 Current landscape of sterile compounding state oversight Characteristics of participating states After the final outreach to all 51 individual state boards of pharmacy (which includes the District of Columbia), 43 of the states (84 percent) had completed the questionnaire. Eight states (Alaska, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Maine, North Carolina, Ohio, and Wisconsin) did not complete the questionnaire. Some of these states simply declined to participate, while others were willing to complete it but were unable to respond in a timely manner. The results were generally representative of the main regions of the United States: Northeast (eight of nine states and the District of Columbia, or 89 percent), Midwest (10 of 12 states, or 83 percent), South (13 of 17 states, or 76 percent), and West (12 of 13 states, or 92 percent). According to 2014 U.S. census data, the states that responded to our questionnaire represented the majority of the population in each region: Northeast (97 percent), Midwest (74 percent), South (66 percent), and West (99 percent). Additional characteristics of the 50 states and the District of Columbia are provided in Table 1, which presents pharmacy counts in each state using information from the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) Pharmacy Provider Database. This database contains over 75,000 pharmacies and is used by many prescription processors, pharmacy benefit managers, health plans, and government entities. Table 1 also presents the number of sterile compounding pharmacies in each state where this information was provided by respondents. Pharmacies performing sterile compounding as a percentage of all pharmacies in each state ranged from 3 to 24 percent. Results from this group of 43 participating states are described and discussed below. Data from all states, including those not participating in the questionnaire, are available in Appendix B. Information for nonparticipant states was retrieved for tables in this appendix from public websites, to the extent possible.

Deficiencies in sterile compounding practices can, and have, led to patient harm and death. The USP has established widely recognized quality standards for pharmacy compounding: USP Chapters <797> (sterile preparations) and <795> (nonsterile sidebar.) United States Pharmacopeia Chapter <797> The USP has developed standards to help compounding practitioners adhere to widely accepted, scientifically sound procedures and practices. USP standards can be legally enforceable when incorporated into or referenced by state laws or regulations. The USP Chapter <797> provides procedures and requirements for compounding sterile preparations. It describes conditions and practices to prevent patient harm resulting from microbial contamination, excessive bacterial endotoxins, 43 variability in intended strength, unintended chemical and physical contaminants, and ingredients of inappropriate quality in compounded sterile preparations. Chapter <797> describes appropriate sterile gowning, cleaning procedures, environmental controls such as airflow, and monitoring practices to detect and prevent unsafe levels of contaminants in the air and on equipment and surfaces. Adherence to quality standards is essential to the safe preparation of sterile drugs. Of note, the USP is currently working to update its standards for sterile compounding and published a proposed revision to Chapter <797> in September of 2015. 44 The USP is also working to develop Chapter <800>, which will cover the compounding of hazardous drugs.45 Our study found that most regulatory bodies (34 of 43 states, or 79 percent) referenced or incorporated USP <797> standards for sterile compounding in their laws and regulations. However, 13 of these 34 respondents (or 38 percent) indicated that the state does not require USP <797> in its entirety. Seven of the eight states reporting that they do not require USP <797> indicated that they will require the standard under pending policy changes. (See Table 2.)10 Table 2 State Requirement of USP Chapter <797> on Sterile Compounding, and State Definitions of Compounding for the Purposes of Meeting This Requirement Number Percentage* Does the state mandate USP Chapter <797> on sterile compounding or equivalent for pharmacies that perform sterile compounding?

(See Table 2.) State definitions included varying criteria, such as the combination of two or more ingredients, repackaging, reconstitution, diluting, or pooling. As a consequence, drugs prepared in one state may not be held to the same standard as those prepared in another, depending on the definition of compounding. This has implications for the quality standards applied to products shipped across state lines. For example, a repackaged sterile product made in a state that does not consider this compounding, and thus not subject to USP <797> standards, could be sent to a state that does require USP compliance for sterile repackaging. This presents an additional challenge for state regulators, who are already confronted with the task of how to best ensure the safety of compounded drugs shipped from other states. Minimum quality standards that are consistent across both drug preparation activities and states would help ensure that compounders within and outside of the state prepare safe drug products and protect the public from potential harms. Must receive five hours of continuing education, live, with written test, and must be monitored compounding in a hood [enclosed workspace with air controls] with written evaluation. Must receive passing grade on written monitoring evaluation. To engage in the practice of sterile compounding, a minimum of one CPE hour must be ACPE accredited and related to the practice of sterile compounding. Rule requires all individuals to obtain practical and/ or academic training in the compounding and dispensing of sterile preparations, and further complete a minimum of one hour of accredited CE on an annual basis. Have appropriate practical and didactic training in sterile compounding, clean room technology, laminar flow technology, quality assurance technique, and clinical applications of IV drug therapy. Shall have didactic and practical training in sterile preparation compounding prior to compounding and annually thereafter. All personnel, including pharmacists, pharmacists who supervise compounding personnel, pharmacy interns, and pharmacy technicians, shall have completed didactic and experiential training with competency evaluation through demonstration and testing (written or practical) as required by USP/NF (USP General Chapters: Pharmaceutical Compounding\u2014Sterile Preparations). Pharmacy technicians shall complete 100 hours. All sterile compounding personnel (pharmacy technicians and pharmacists) must have proof of personal competency in the art of sterile compounding completed annually. To renew their license/registration, all pharmacists and pharmacy technicians must complete two hours of ACPE-accredited continuing education relating to one or more listed areas in sterile preparation if the pharmacy technician is engaged in compounding low- and medium-risk sterile preparations; or four hours if the pharmacy technician is engaged in compounding high-risk sterile preparations. Table 3 Examples of State Requirements for Specific Minimum Training on Sterile Compounding Beyond Training Expectations Set Forth in USP Chapter <797> \u00a9 2016 The Pew Charitable Trusts12 In response to questions regarding training requirements for pharmacists conducting sterile compounding, a majority of respondents (28 of 43 states, or 65 percent) reported that they did not mandate specific expectations for specialized training in sterile compounding, beyond what is currently required in USP <797>, as a condition of competency for pharmacists engaging in such activity. Ten states (23 percent of respondents) reported specific training requirements: Alabama, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, New Mexico, South Carolina, and Texas. For example, as of September 2015, Texas indicated that it will require all pharmacists and pharmacy technicians who conduct sterile compounding to complete annual training in this practice (see Table 3 for additional examples). The number of hours required will depend on whether the practitioner is engaged in low- and medium-risk sterile preparations (two hours) or high-risk sterile preparations (four hours). 46 Both Texas and New Jersey clarified in their questionnaire responses that they assess compliance with specific sterile compounding training requirements during facility inspections. Research suggests that many pharmacy schools and educational programs for pharmacists and technicians lack appropriate hands-on training in aseptic technique and sterile compounding. In 2005, 82 accredited U.S. pharmacy schools were surveyed regarding the extent to which they provided didactic and laboratory instruction related to compounded sterile preparations. Among the 53 schools that responded, 88 percent taught students about USP <797>; however, only 13 percent felt that their students had been adequately trained in sterile compounding prior to graduation. 47 Given this potential gap in education, it is possible that some pharmacists may not recognize deficiencies in their own sterile compounding practices. Monitoring and enforcement To effectively oversee compounding activity, state regulators need reliable information about facilities that compound and their ability to meaningfully respond to any safety deficiencies. In this regard, the monitoring and enforcement tools available to state regulatory bodies were uneven. Twenty-four of 43 respondents (56 percent) reported tracking the number of pharmacies performing sterile compounding in their state, and 17 of them provided a count. Slightly fewer respondents (19 of 43, or 44 percent) said their state tracked the number of out-of-state pharmacies shipping or dispensing compounded drugs into the state. Sixteen respondents (37 percent) reported that they did not track compounding pharmacies. (See Table 4.) Reliable data on total number of sterile compounding pharmacies in the U.S. remain elusive. There is no central repository of information tracking pharmacies that perform sterile compounding; NCPDP, the source this study used for counts of pharmacies performing compounding in each state, started collecting data in May 2011 on the specific type of compounding activity pharmacies performed, but these data have limitations. Compounding data is self-reported by pharmacies and questions about specific compounding services are currently optional. 48 Few states (five, or 12 percent) responding to the questionnaire reported that they separately tracked sterile compounding violations. They are Alabama, Arizona, California, Maryland, and New Jersey. While most states indicated that they report pharmacy violations on a public website (36 states, or 84 percent), only three states\u2014California, Massachusetts, and New Mexico\u2014said they list compounding-related violations separately. (See Table 4.) Most states did not require pharmacies performing sterile compounding to report voluntary recalls, either to the state only (7 percent do), FDA (7 percent), or both (9 percent). Reporting requirements were slightly more common for adverse events: 30 percent of states required sterile compounding pharmacies to report serious adverse events to the state, to FDA, or to both. (See Table 4.) Adverse event reporting is required by federal law for pharmaceutical companies and outsourcing facilities. 49 It can be used to identify problems that may affect other patients who received drugs from the same batch.

With respect to enforcement authority, most respondents (88 percent) reported that the state had the power to request reports of sterile products prepared by pharmacies. An ability to know the amount of sterile compounded products that pharmacies ship out of state may be relevant to state participation in an anticipated FDA-state memorandum of understanding system to address the inordinate interstate distribution of compounded drugs. As required under Section 503A of the FDCA, FDA is working to develop a standard memorandum of understanding for this purpose. Most respondents had the authority to issue cease-and-desist orders (88 percent), but approximately two-thirds (70 percent) were unable to mandate a recall of compounded drugs or were unsure of their explicit authority to do so. (See Table 5.) This may reflect a technical lack of recall authority rather than an inability to advance a recall, given that state regulators ultimately control licensure and may use this to request pharmacy actions when there is a real or perceived emergent threat to public health. In addition, other state officials, such as state governors, have the ability to take action when public health is threatened. 50 Understanding recall authority is important as it is a powerful tool to ensure that drug compounders are compliant with state regulations having Table 5 State Authorities Regarding Pharmacies That Perform Sterile Compounding For pharmacies that perform sterile compounding, does your state have the authority to ...Number Percentage Mandate a recall (n = 43) Yes 13 30% No 19 44% Don't know 11 26% Issue a cease-and-desist order (n = 42*) Yes 37 88% No 4 10% Don't know 1 2% Request reports from pharmacies that perform sterile compounding on the number of sterile products prepared (n = 43) Yes 38 88% No 3 7% Don't know 2 5% Note: * One state chose not to answer this question. \u00a9 2016 The Pew Charitable Trusts15 implications for protecting public health. Similar to adverse event reporting, the need for an effective recall system is greater for facilities making standardized or batched medicines, which can affect more patients. Compounding without prescriptions and the new outsourcing facility sector Section 503A of the FDCA does not allow the compounding of drugs for human use without a prescription, also known as office stock or office use compounding. This is only allowed if a facility registers with FDA as an outsourcing facility under Section 503B of the FDCA and meets CGMP standards. However, there was some legal uncertainty about the enforceability of Section 503A until the passage of the DQSA in 2013, and states may still be working to adapt their regulations. Our study found that nearly two-thirds of respondents allowed traditional compounding pharmacies to produce drugs without prescriptions to at least some extent. (See Table 6.) Ten respondents reported that their policies did not allow compounding without prescriptions: the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, New York, Rhode Island, Washington, and West Virginia. Based on public websites, Maine (a nonrespondent state) also prohibits compounding without a prescription. 51 An additional three states\u2014Minnesota, Louisiana, and New Mexico\u2014reported that compounding without prescriptions was allowed only for veterinary use, and based on public information North Carolina took the same position. 52 Finally, Nebraska indicated in its response that pharmacies engaging in this practice should be FDA-registered outsourcing facilities to comply with federal regulations. Other limits placed on compounding without prescriptions were less restrictive, such as allowing any quantity justified by a doctor's prescribing habits. (See Table 6.) Although states may have written policies prohibiting compounding without a patient-specific prescription, this study did not assess whether or how such policies were enforced. In addition, in some cases states appeared to conflate anticipatory compounding\u2014compounding before the receipt of an anticipated valid prescription\u2014with compounding a supply of a drug without a prescription to be stocked by a doctor's office or clinic. While federal law allows for anticipatory compounding, it still requires the compounder to receive a prescription prior to dispensing the compounded drug to the patient. Notably, few respondents (7 percent) reported pending policy changes on compounding by pharmacies without a patient-specific prescription. The few states that did report changes were evenly split between prohibiting the practice, limiting it, or allowing it. Regulatory disparity both between states and with federal law may make attempts to harmonize the oversight of compounding without prescriptions (office stock compounding) challenging. Under the DQSA, in exchange for submitting to more stringent oversight, the new outsourcing facility category is now the only group allowed to legally compound without prescriptions. If states allow compounding by traditional pharmacies without patient-specific prescriptions, it could remove incentives for companies to participate in the new outsourcing facility system. State approaches to recognizing outsourcing facilities (OFs) varied, and only seven states had developed a specific OF licensure or registration category at the time of data collection. Five of these states reported this through our questionnaire: California (bill pending in Legislature), Idaho, Mississippi, New York, and Tennessee. Based on the review of public websites, Delaware and Florida also have an OF category, although this was not confirmed by a state contact. Additionally, 12 respondents reported that they were currently developing an OF licensure or registration category. Other states were mixed: Some required OFs to license as manufacturers, some as wholesalers, and some as pharmacies, while some permitted multiple licensure categories. (See Tables 7 and 8.) Federal law neither prohibits nor requires pharmacy licensure for OFs. If OFs maintain a traditional pharmacy practice as well as an outsourcing facility, continued licensure as a pharmacy is likely to be appropriate. In some cases, state licensure requirements may be mutually exclusive, for example, if one state 16 Table 6 State Policies on Compounding Without Patient-Specific Prescriptions Number Percentage Does your state allow pharmacies to compound without patient-specific prescriptions?

This puts OFs that wish to be licensed by both states in an unworkable compliance situation. There also appeared to be some uncertainty among states regarding how to address facilities performing sterile compounding without patient-specific prescriptions that are not registered as an OF with FDA, as federal law requires. While approximately half of respondents reported that they would take some action, this was fairly evenly split between requiring these facilities to register with FDA, informing the agency of their existence, or disciplining the facility. Four states, Maryland, Minnesota, Tennessee, and West Virginia, reported that they would take all three actions. Nine states (21 percent) said they would take none of these actions. (See Table 8.) 17 Table 7 State Licensure or Registration Policy for Facilities That Register With FDA Under the Outsourcing Facility Category of Drug Compounders Number Percentage* How does your state license or register facilities that register with FDA under the new federal outsourcing facility (OF) category of drug compounders?

However, of the seven states that allowed this practice without limitation, none reported that they would take disciplinary action; one reported that it would require registration with FDA, and one indicated that it would inform the agency of such facilities. Licensure Pharmacy licensure is an important method for states to set both the general and activity-specific requirements that drug compounders must meet, as well as monitor the activity of compounders. Separate licensure for sterile compounding pharmacies is one approach to more closely targeting oversight and enforcement activities\u2014for example, it could allow a regulator to address sterile compounding violations at a pharmacy without shutting down other activities. However, separate licensure systems are yet to be widely adopted. One in five respondents required pharmacies to have a separate licensure to perform sterile compounding. (See Table 9.) Some of these policies were recently enacted: In December 2014, the Massachusetts Legislature passed a law that established separate licensure for sterile compounding pharmacies both in and out of state. 53 Regulations to implement the law also stipulate that out-of-state pharmacies cannot dispense any sterile compounded drug into Massachusetts unless they hold a \"Nonresident Sterile Compounding Pharmacy\" license. Whether or not they perform compounding, licensure or registration of out-of-state pharmacies is the norm across states. (See Table 9.) Table 9 State Licensure of Pharmacies That Perform Sterile Compounding and Nonresident Pharmacies Number Percentage Does your state have a separate license or other requirement (e.g., permit) for pharmacies that perform sterile compounding?

This study explores state policies on important aspects of inspections of pharmacies that perform sterile compounding. The most commonly reported circumstances that triggered inspections of such pharmacies in the state were initial licensure, when a pharmacy remodels or moves locations, occurrences of complaints or incidents, and licensure renewal. (See Table 10.) Respondents generally required that inspections occur at least every 12 months, though 10 states reported an inspection frequency of every two years or longer, and several states reported no specific frequency.

To better understand these differences in the context of the number of pharmacies within the state, the researchers divided the number of pharmacies in each state in the NCPDP database by the number of pharmacy inspectors reported by the state. The number of pharmacies per inspector ranged from 40 to 900, with a mean of 230 (standard deviation = 159) and a median of 183. It is worthwhile to note that differences in state policy and inspector workload allocation also affect how oversight is conducted. In addition, in some cases states may outsource inspections to third parties to improve their oversight reach. Inspections require resources, and insufficient funding can affect inspection frequency, as well as staff hiring and training. In any situation, but particularly when resources are limited, states may seek to prioritize oversight of compounding pharmacies based on risk. Approximately one-quarter of respondents (12 states, or 28 percent) reported prioritizing inspections for in-state pharmacies where high-risk sterile compounding occurs. However, respondents generally did not report higher than annual inspection frequencies for these high-risk facilities. One state, Colorado, reported inspecting these facilities every six months. The questionnaire also asked regulators how drug compounders shipping into their state from other locations were assessed for compliance, which may or may not include an in-person inspection (Table 11), and respondents varied in their approaches. While some states such as California 54 conduct their own inspections of out-of- state pharmacies, many states reported relying on inspections by the state where the pharmacy is located (49 percent), and/ or inspections by a third party (53 percent), and states may also combine approaches.

Most respondents relying on a third party reported working with the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy's Verified Pharmacy Program. Five respondents (12 percent) reported that they did not verify the compliance of out-of-state sterile compounders. The frequency for assessing the compliance of out-of-state pharmacies varied considerably, with 40 percent of respondents indicating that there was no specific time frame. (See Table 12.) However, it is possible that some states may have interpreted this question as \"frequency of inspection,\" which is one of several possible strategies of assessing compliance.

Inspections of sterile compounding pharmacies typically lasted for less than eight hours. (See Table 13.) Only the District of Columbia, Minnesota, and Washington reported that inspections of sterile compounding pharmacies usually lasted from one to three days. Virginia reported that hospital pharmacy inspections usually take two days. Most states held inspections that were unannounced but did not require direct observation of sterile compounding activity, even if by simulation. Ten jurisdictions reported that they required direct observation of sterile compounding activity during inspections: California, the District of Columbia, Indiana, Maryland, Montana, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Washington.

Respondents generally indicated that inspection factors included important sterile compounding topics covered by USP <797> (Table 14), which is interesting given that only about half of respondents reported mandating USP <797> in its entirety. However, these questions did not assess the specific requirement for each inspection factor assessed by the state, so they cannot be used to evaluate alignment with USP <797>. Finally, when issues are discovered during inspection, most respondents (79 percent) required a written response from the pharmacy describing how the issues were addressed, and a majority (67 percent) also needed an additional on-site inspection to verify compliance. (See Table 15.) The ability of states to take samples of compounded products for testing also varied. This may be due, in part, to the high costs of sample testing, which can be prohibitive depending on state resource constraints. Majorities of respondents reported that their states required that inspectors who assess sterile compounding be licensed pharmacists (70 percent), have prior experience within a pharmacy (60 percent), and have training on applicable USP standards (58 percent). (See Figure 1.) Interestingly, among states that mandated full or partial compliance with USP <797> (21 and 13 respondents, respectively) for sterile compounding, only 14 of 21 (67 percent) and 6 of 13 (46 percent) required that their inspectors to be trained in applicable USP standards. Lack of a requirement does not mean that states never secure such training for inspectors, but insufficient training can undermine the state's ability to recognize a violation through inspection.

Our study found variability in the authority of states to share information about inspections, investigations, and enforcement concerns related to drug compounding with in-state, out-of-state, and federal officials. Twenty-six, 28, and 30 respondents reported that they could share information with in-state, federal, and other state officials, respectively (corresponding to 60 percent, 65 percent, and 70 percent of the 43 respondents). One respondent reported no authority to share information. (See Table 16.) Third parties, such as the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, are engaged in efforts to establish clearinghouses of inspection information for states to access, and to facilitate state recognition of one another's inspections through harmonized inspection checklists. Physician office or clinic compounding Drug compounding generally occurs in pharmacies but may also take place in doctors' offices or clinics. Regardless of where sterile compounding is practiced, quality assurance is critical. Some research suggests that the frequency of contamination of parenteral (injected or infused) drug preparations is higher in clinical environments (e.g., hospital unit or operating room) than in controlled pharmacy environments. 55 Only one respondent state, Idaho, reported that its state board of pharmacy oversaw compounding that occurs within doctors' offices; most states were not certain that any meaningful oversight system exists, even by state medical boards. (See Table 17.) There is little to no clarity on which quality standards apply to sterile compounding in physician offices, and often no mechanisms exist to track adverse events in these settings. (See Figure 2.)

Don't the national outbreak of meningitis linked to contaminated compounded injections has driven a number of individual states to revisit the regulation of sterile compounding, this study revealed substantial variability in state regulation and oversight. Although many states had adopted widely recognized USP quality standards, some applied them only in part, and some did not require them at all. Inspection practices varied in frequency and length, and the ratio of pharmacy inspectors to pharmacies ranged widely, revealing potentially uneven oversight practices across the nation. States also applied notably different policies on compounding without a prescription; some were permissive, and others were restrictive. While federal law passed in 2013 clarified that pharmacies may not compound without prescriptions unless they are registered with FDA, it appears that states have not moved quickly to synchronize their regulations to federal policy. States bear the primary responsibility for oversight of pharmacy compounding in their jurisdictions. Significant variability in state oversight systems, particularly given the interstate movement of some compounded drugs, suggests that quality assurance practices to protect patients may be inconsistent. Many states are currently considering policy changes, and this study was designed to provide a useful landscape assessment of oversight systems that states can use when considering both their own policies and those governing out-of-state pharmacies that ship to the state. The results suggest that states may benefit from additional tools that describe policy best practices, lessons learned from states successfully advancing change and effectively allocating resources, and up-to-date model legislation and regulation in conformance with changes to federal law. These tools could be a resource to individual states reviewing practices, and also Table 17 State Body Responsible for Oversight of Sterile Compounding Occurring in Physician Offices Number Percentage* How do states provide oversight of physician offices or clinics that perform sterile compounding to ensure compliance with applicable standards?

Ideally, best practices should inform broader research pursuits to assess the landscape of state oversight systems today and analyze their strengths and weaknesses. This study may be useful in providing a baseline that facilitates the evaluation of policy transitions with respect to state oversight of sterile compounding practices. Study limitations This study had several limitations. First, although the study achieved a response rate of more than 80 percent from the 50 states and the District of Columbia, eight states did not complete our questionnaire. Second, the study could not definitively ascertain the accuracy of some responses where information was not available on public websites. However, the research team was careful to select potential respondents based on the experiences of our expert advisory panel. Furthermore, state boards of pharmacy are responsible for defining state oversight of pharmacy compounding practice, and therefore respondents from these regulatory bodies should be authorities on the most current status of their jurisdiction. The authors are therefore confident that respondents participating in this study were among the most appropriate and knowledgeable sources of information available on current state oversight practices. Owing to rigorous follow-up and diligence, there were no missing responses to individual questions; however, two respondents reported as being \"unsure\" on several questions. This may have reflected an inability to answer questions before the questionnaire deadline, rather than uncertainty among regulators about their state's policy or authority. In addition, one question regarding state oversight of out-of-state facilities was not understood uniformly by respondents, potentially limiting our ability to interpret responses to that particular question, as noted in Table 12. Finally, responses to questions on whether compounding without prescriptions was permitted in states may reflect differing interpretations of what constitutes a full prohibition on compounding without prescriptions.29 Appendix A: Glossary of terms 503B facility. See outsourcing facility. Adverse event. Any undesirable experience associated with the use of a medical product in a patient. Anticipatory compounding. Creation of a drug product prior to receipt of a prescription, based on a history of receiving such prescriptions. A prescription is received before the compounder dispenses or distributes the product. (This is distinct from office stock compounding, in which the compounder dispenses or distributes products to a provider without ever receiving prescriptions.) Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP). Minimum requirements for the methods, facilities, and controls used in the manufacturing, processing, and packing of a drug product. They are enforced in the United States by FDA, under Section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 USCS \u00a7 351). Drug Quality and Security Act (DQSA). On Nov. 27, 2013, President Obama signed the Drug Quality and Security Act, legislation with two titles: Title I contains important provisions relating to the oversight of compounding of human drugs, and Title II creates a drug serialization and tracking system. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services responsible for, among other things, protecting the public health by ensuring that human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products, and medical devices intended for human use are safe and effective. 56 Good Manufacturing Practice. See Current Good Manufacturing Practice. High-risk sterile compounding. Includes compounding activities that present potentially higher risk of compromised sterility in the end product, such as the preparation of sterile drugs from nonsterile components. In-state pharmacy. Licensed pharmacy physically located within the state. May be referred to as a resident pharmacy. Nonresident pharmacy. See out-of-state pharmacy.Office stock compounding. Creating standardized drug products to be kept as stock in a doctor's office or hospital. By definition, these products are not compounded, dispensed, or distributed by a compounder pursuant to an individual patient prescription. Normally this is differentiated from anticipatory compounding, in which the product is prepared in advance of receiving a prescription but is not dispensed or distributed by a compounder until the prescription is received. FDA's current position is that office stock compounding is not permitted under federal law\u2014Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act specifies that traditional compounders may only receive exemptions from federal drug approval requirements if they compound pursuant to an individual patient prescription. Out-of-state pharmacy. Licensed pharmacy not physically located within the state. Also referred to as nonresident pharmacy. Outsourcing facility. Under Section 503B of the Drug Quality and Security Act, a compounder can become an \"outsourcing facility,\" defined as a facility at one geographic location or address that (1) is engaged in the compounding of sterile drugs, (2) has elected to register as an outsourcing facility, and (3) complies with all of the requirements of Section 503B. Major requirements include registration with FDA, reporting of adverse 30 events and products compounded to FDA, and payment of fees to FDA. Outsourcing facilities are permitted to compound and distribute drugs without receiving individual patient prescriptions, but they are not exempt from current Good Manufacturing Practices. They may hold a pharmacy license but are not required to do so under federal law. Physician office compounding. Compounding that occurs in a physician's office, either by a physician or by another practitioner for that physician. Recalls. Actions taken by a firm to remove a product from the market. Recalls may be conducted on a firm's own initiative or by regulator request. FDA does not currently have the statutory authority to mandate a drug recall. State authorities here may differ. Resident pharmacy. Licensed pharmacy physically located within the state. May be referred to as in-state pharmacy. Serious adverse event.
