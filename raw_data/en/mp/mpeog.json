Consensus Statement on Immunization During Pregnancy Immunization during pregnancy has been recommended in an in creasing number of countries.Theaimofthisstrategyistoprotectpregnantwo menandinfantsfromsevere infectious disease, morbidity and mortality and is current ly limited to tetanus, inactivated influenza, and pertussis-containing vaccines. There have b een recent advancements in the development of vaccines designed primarily for use in pr egnant women (respiratory syncytial virus and group B Streptococcus vaccines). Although there is increasing evidencetosupportvaccinationinpregnancy,importantga psinknowledgestillexistand need to be addressed by future studies. This collaborative c onsensus paper provides a review of the current literature on immunization during pr egnancy and highlights the gapsinknowledgeandaconsensusofprioritiesforfuturere searchinitiatives,inorderto optimize protection for both the mother and the infant. Keywords: group B Streptococcus vaccines, influenza, maternal immunization, pertussis, pregn ant women, respiratory syncytial virus, tetanus INTRODUCTION Vaccination of pregnant women induces a vaccine-specic immune response in the mothers and the transfer of vaccine- specic antibodies via the eted pathogens ( 1,2). The potential of maternal immunization in protecting young infants was made evident by tetanus vaccination during pregnancy contributing to the reduction in incidence of neonatal tetanus ( 3). This has also become evident by the decrease in the incidence of severe pertussis disease in young infants in countries that have implemented pertussis immunizationprogramsinpregnancy( 4-7). During the last decade, an increasing number of countries have included vaccines for pregnant women in their national vaccination programs. Vaccination with tetanus-containin g vaccines in pregnancy has been recommended for years in most low and middle -income countries (LMICs) ( 3), and pertussis and influenza vaccination programs for pregnant women have been more recently recommended in a number of high-income countries (HICs) and LMICs ( of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and group BStreptococcus (GBS) infections in infants through maternal vaccination has become a priority and a target for potential ne w vaccinecandidatesintrialsanddevelopment( 10-12). To optimize the protection oered to mothers and infants by maternal immunization, several factors that can aect thi s strategy must be better understood ( Figure2). The goal of this consensus paper written by experts in infectious diseases , vaccination and maternal immunization from dierent world regions is to summarize current evidence in the eld of immunizationduringpregnancyandtohighlighttheknowledg e gapsandprioritizefutureresearchstrategiesinordertoopti mize protectionforthemother,fetusandtheinfant. STUDY DESIGN The main aim of this consensus paper is to discuss current knowledge regarding immunization during pregnancy andhighlightthegapsthatneedtobeaddressedtoensurethehigh est protection for both the mother and their infants. References were identied through searches of PubMed for human studies published in English using the terms \"immunization\" or \"vaccination\" or streptococcus\" and \"pregnancy.\" Articles resulting from the se searches and relevant references cited in those articles we re reviewed. References were also provided by authors. Outcomes assessed were safety, immunogenicity, ecacy, and eective ness of immunization during pregnancy against tetanus, pertussis, influenza, RSV, and GBS diseases. After the initial review, a meeting was held in Italy to discuss the current literature a nd knowledge gaps. A consensus on the content was reached after multipleroundsofrevisionamongtheauthors. ETHICS IN VACCINE TRIALS DURING PREGNANCY Maternalimmunization,andtheuseofmedicationinpregnancy ingeneral,havebeenafocusofethicaldeliberationsfordec ades. Untilrecently,theethicalprevailingapproachforimmunizatio n during pregnancy was based on the precautionary principle, which limits introduction of new intervention whose ultimat e eects are uncertain. This precautionary principle-centered approach,combinedwithriskaversionamonglegaldepartments of vaccine manufacturers, led to exclusion of pregnant women from most vaccine trials for decades, leading to gaps in evide nce of vaccine safety and ecacy among pregnant women. With an increasing focus on maternal immunization, there has bee n reconsiderationofrelevantethicalparadigmsresultingin several recentdevelopmentsinthisarea. First, a report of the U.S. National Vaccine Advisory Committee's Working Group on Maternal Immunization Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 2 June 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 1282Abu-Raya et al. Consensus Statement on Immunization During Pregnancy FIGURE 1 | Countries with recommendations for immunization against p ertussis in pregnancy by ofcial authorities (for South Amer ica, pertussis immunization during pregnancy is recommended by The Pan American Health Organiz ation). This gure was inspired by G. Amirthalingham and K. Ma ertens and created by K. Maertens. recommended that \"Relevant regulations, statutes, and policies...should be modied to indicate that pregnant women are not a vulnerable population for the purposes of ethical review\" ( 13). This recommendation and concurrent policy action led to a change in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations which had previously classied pregnant women as being inherently vulnerable to coercion ( 14). Second, recognizing that conventional paradigms often treated the r isks and benets of maternal immunization to mothers and infants as independent entities, a maternal interest-based paradigm was proposed by Chamberlain et al. ( 15). This paradigm recognizes the legitimacy of maternal interests in protecti ng their infants and the legitimacy of her taking measures that benet only the fetus/newborn even if such measures do not have direct benets for the mother herself. The third major development was creation of the Pregnancy Research Ethics for Vaccines, Epidemics, and New Technologies (PREVENT) working group. This multidisciplinary, international team o f 17 experts developed a roadmap for inclusion of the interests of pregnant women in the development and deployment of vaccines ( 16). The underlying goal of these recommendations was to ensure that pregnant women's inclusion in vaccine trials is the default position and that any exclusions need to be justied rather than justications being needed for inclus ion of pregnantwomen. Globally, a progress has also been made in the prioritization of immunization in pregnancy and the inclusion of pregnant women in vaccine trials. The WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) recommended in 2012 that pregnant women should be highly prioritized for influenzavaccination in countries that consider initiating or expandi ng of seasonalinfluenzavaccineprograms( 17).In2015,SAGEfurther emphasized the importance of the platform of immunization in pregnancy,aswelltheneedtostrengthenthedeliveryofvacc ines administeredduringpregnancy( 18). These and other developments in ethical considerations for maternal immunization are likely to result in a more conduciveenvironmentformaternalimmunizationresearch and deployment. However, there are a few areas that require furth er deliberations( Table1). SAFETY OF IMMUNIZATION DURING PREGNANCY Safety of vaccines administered during pregnancy needs to be evaluated for both the mother and her newborn, and is an important consideration for the mothers' willingness to receive a vaccine during pregnancy. There is a signicant bulk of evidence to support the safety of immunization with tetanus toxoids (TT), the longest standing vaccine that is recommended during pregnancy. There is also an increasing body of evidence to support the safety of pertussis and influenza immunization during pregnancy (see below specic sections). However, continuous assessment and reporting of adverse eventsafterimmunizationduringpregnancyremainsimportan t, especiallyforrelativelynewlyintroducedmaternalvaccine s(e.g., pertussis), as it informs about rare events that might follow immunization. In addition, assessment of baseline pregnanc y outcomes in unvaccinated women in dierent world regions Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 3 June 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 1282Abu-Raya et al.

Created by Claudio Rosa. and settings will help in establishing baselines to assess s afety outcomesagainst. Furthermore, there is signicant heterogeneity and lack of consensusonadverseeventreportinginmaternalimmunizati on studies. This is a challenge for comparing and pooling data from dierent studies. In an attempt to overcome this weakness, WHO and the Brighton Collaboration worked together to provide written guidance on how to conduct safety studies in the eld of maternal immunization ( 19). The initiative termed the Global Alignment of Immunization Safety Assessment in Pregnancy (GAIA) project worked on standardizing the assessment of safety of vaccines in pregna ncy with specic focus on LMICs ( 20). Specically, this initiative proposed systematic data collection, specic case denitions of key obstetric and neonatal health outcomes, ontology ofkey terms and a map of pertinent disease codes. More recently, case denition and guidelines for data collection , analysis and presentation has been proposed for neonatal seizures, neurodevelopmental delay, chorioamnionitis and post- partum endometritis and GAIA and Brighton collaboration working groups ( 21-24). Future studies assessing safety of immunization during pregnancy should use the proposed terms and denitions. In addition, currently availab le data on safety of vaccination in pregnancy is derived from vaccinesthatwereinitiallylicensedinnon-pregnantpopulati ons. Future vaccine trials will likely assess vaccines intended to be licensed primarily for use in pregnant women. This further emphasizes the need to standardize reporting of safet y outcomesinmaternalimmunizationtrials.Thus,werecommen d following the GAIA and Brighton collaboration guidelines Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 4 June 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 1282Abu-Raya et al. Consensus Statement on Immunization During Pregnancy TABLE 1 | Ethics areas related to immunization during pregnancy that require further deliberations. Are there differential ethical considerations based on the gestational week of vaccination? How is acceptable risk dened in pregnancy? Can countries justify mass deployment of vaccines for use du ring pregnancy without an injury compensation program? for assessment and reporting of safety outcomes in maternal immunizationtrials. KEY FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE IMMUNOGENICITY AND EFFICACY/EFFECTIVENESS OF IMMUNIZATION DURING PREGNANCY Immune Responses of Pregnant Women to Vaccination The immune system of a pregnant woman is adapted to allow for the survival of the semi-allogeneic fetus. Serum estrad iol levels increase up to 500-fold during normal pregnancy ( 25), and the interplay between sex hormones and the maternal immune system in pregnancy is complex ( Table2). These changes might lead to the assumption that there are dierences in immune responses to vaccines between healthy pregnant and non-pregnant women potentially leading to a lower immune response in pregnant women. However, studies comparing immunogenicity of vaccines in pregnant and non-pregnant women have generally not demonstrated decreased antibody responses in pregnant women. This has been the case for TT (40) and for the pertussis antigens in the combined tetanus, diphtheria,andacellularpertussisvaccine(Tdap)( 41).However, results for influenza vaccines have been less consistent. So me studies carried out with influenza vaccines, including both the pandemic H1N1/2009 (pH1N1/2009) monovalent inactivated vaccine (MIV) and seasonal IV) preparations, show similar hemagglutination inhibition (HA I) seroconversion rates and antibody titers in pregnant and non-pregnant women ( 42-44). Other studies showed lower seroconversion rates and lower HAI geometric mean titers af ter vaccinationofpregnantwomenwhencomparedtonon-pregnant women(45-47). The eect of maternal immunization on cellular immunity has been less studied limiting conclusions. Proliferative and interferon- responses to the Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis ) antigens pertussis toxin (PT) 1 month after receipt of Tdap vaccine were not signicantly in maternal adaptive immune system during pregn ancy. Main changes References Lower B cell levels in pregnant women compared with non-pregnant women(26) B cell lymphopenia in the third-trimester of pregnancy ( 25) Estrogen reduces B cell lymphopoiesis during pregnancy ( 27,28) Decrease in B cell function (29) Decreased total IgG levels, especially during late pregnanc y ( 30,31) High estradiol levels promote T helper 2 cell responses ( 32-34) Elevated progesterone during pregnancy inhibits T helper 1 cell immune responses(35) A progressive shift from T helper 1 cell to T helper 2 cell resp onses ( 36) Decrease in T cell function (37-39) Trans-placental Transfer of Maternal Antibodies Immunoglobulin G (IgG) is the dominant immunoglobulin isotype that crosses the placenta and contributes to maternal ly derived passive immunity during early infancy. In healthy pregnantwomen,IgGtransferacrosstheplacentabeginstowar d the end of the rst trimester of pregnancy and increases as pregnancy progresses. IgG concentrations in the fetus are 5- 10% of the maternal levels at 17-22 weeks gestation, 50% at weeks 28-32, and usually exceed maternal levels by 20- 30% at term ( 49-52). The transplacental transfer is mediated by the neonatal Fc receptors (FcRn), localized in the syncytiotrophoblast that covers the villous tree of the place nta (53).FcRnregulatesIgGtransplacentaltransferthroughbindin g to its constant domain and actively transport IgG into the fet al circulation. Several factors appear to aect the transfer of Ig G across the placenta. IgG subclasses have dierential eciency of transfer across the placenta, dened as the antibody level s in the newborn divided by antibody levels in the mother. Based on studies from the 1990s, IgG1 is the subclass transferred wi th the highest eciency, achieving higher levels in cord compar ed withthematernalblood,andthissubclassisinducedbyvacci nes containing protein antigens ( 54). IgG2 is transferred with the least eciency, achieving lower cord than maternal blood le vels, and is the dominant antibody induced by vaccines containing polysaccharide antigens ( 53,55-58). Transfer of antibodies across the placenta can also be influenced by several clinical conditions in the mother and some of these health conditions are more prevalent in certain parts of the world. For instance, cord IgG levels were lower in infants from women with human immunodeciency virus (HIV) infection ( 59), malaria infection (60),andhypergammaglobulinemia( 61),comparedwithinfants from women without those conditions, and these conditions are more prevalent in LMICs. In addition, the potential eect of toxoplasma and tuberculosis infection on the transfer of maternal antibodies has not been investigated. Furthermor e, other maternal conditions, that have not yet been investiga ted, might also aect the structure of the placenta (e.g., gestatio nal hypertension, gestational diabetes, smoking) and the trans fer of maternalantibodies. Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 5 June 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 1282Abu-Raya et al. Consensus Statement on Immunization During Pregnancy Timing of Immunization A number of factors should be considered when determining the ideal timing of vaccination in pregnancy including time-dependent safety when administered at dierent time points in gestation, time-dependent eciency of transplacenta l transfer of vaccine-induced antibodies, interference wit h infants' immune response to vaccination and clinical ecacy/eectiveness ( 62,63). Furthermore, the optimal timing of maternal immunization varies depending on who is the target for protection and when maximal protection is desired in the mother and/or the fetus/infant ( 62). For example, pregnancyisawell-knownriskfactorforsevereinfluenza,be ing most severe during the third trimester of pregnancy ( 64,65). Therefore,tomaximizetheprotectionforthemother,itisbe stto administer the influenza vaccine early in pregnancy and ideal ly prior to the peak of influenza seasonal activity. If the primary goal is to protect the infant, as for pertussis, the vaccine sho uld be administered during a time period in gestation to provide optimaltrans-placentaltransferofantibodies,inordertoe nsure maximal protection against pertussis disease in early infancy (66). The risk for premature labor should also be considered as this population is at an increased risk for severe infections, such aspertussisandmightnotbenetfrommaternalvaccinationi fit happenslateingestation( 67-69). Based on the literature review and consultation among authors, a consensus on priorities for future research relat ed to factors aecting immunization during pregnancy was reached(Table3). VACCINES CURRENTLY RECOMMENDED FOR PREGNANT WOMEN Vaccines currently recommended and used are aimed to protect against tetanus, pertussis and influenza diseases. Dierent vaccine formulations and dosages exist for use in pregnant women in selected countries in Europe, North America, South America,andAsia( Table4). Vaccines Against Tetanus The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that if a pregnant woman has never received a tetanus-toxoid - containing Tetanus-diphtheria [Td], T T) or her vaccination status is unknown, she should receive two TT (or Td) vaccine doses 4 weeks apart during pregnancy, with the second dose given at least 2 weeks before delivery. Based o n WHO recommendations, ve total doses are likely needed for protection throughout the childbearing years so a third dose is given 6 months after the second dose, and two additional dose s are recommended to be given during the next 2 years or during twosubsequentpregnancies( 73).Forwomenwhohavereceived 1-4 TT-CV doses prior to their pregnancy, one TT-CV dose is recommended during each subsequent pregnancy to a total of ve doses. However, this vaccination schedule and policy has neverbeenformallyevaluatedinclinicaltrials.TABLE 3 | Consensus on priorities for future research related to fact ors that influence the immunogenicity and efcacy/effectiveness of imm unization during pregnancy.

Time-dependent clinical efcacy/effectiveness (for both term and preterm infants) Safety Several studies have demonstrated TT-CVs to be safe in pregnancy ( 74-76). As the current pertussis-containing vaccines administered in pregnancy are part of multicomponent formulations that include TT, safety assessments of pertuss is- containing vaccines in pregnancy also provide information on the safety of the TT component (see below discussion under pertussis vaccines) ( 77). Safety was demonstrated even when the most recent TT-CV was administered within 2 years prior to vaccinationinpregnancy( 76). Immunogenicity Several studies have shown that following maternal immunization with TT-CVs, anti-TT IgG is actively transferr ed across the placenta, leading to protective levels in the infan t (77-80). Vaccination with TT induces IgG1 ( 54,81), which are eciently transferred across the placenta. Approximately 80% of maternal antibodies remain present in infants 1 month after delivery; thus, protection is maintained until a primary vaccination course is commenced and is maximal during the most vulnerable period when umbilical infections may occur(82).

In a small study from Vietnam, vaccination with Tdap in pregnancy resulted in high er cord anti-TT IgG levels compared with vaccination with TT, however, this dierence did not persist at 2 months of age ( 83). These results are reassuring that replacing TT with Tdap is no t expectedtoresultininferiorimmunogenicityagainsttetan us.Effectiveness Both maternal and neonatal tetanus were very common in most developing countries even into the 1980's.

The WHOs most updated goal is to achieve maternal and neonatal tetanus elimination by 2020 which will be dicul t toachieve( 85). Based on the literature review and consultation among authors, a consensus on priorities for future research relat ed to immunization against tetanus during pregnancy was reached(Table5). Vaccines Against Pertussis Safety Dataontolerabilityandsafetyofpertussisimmunizationdu ring pregnancy are reassuring ( 86). This has been demonstrated with dierent Tdap vaccine formulations regardless of the number of pertussis antigens included in the vaccines ( 77,87-96). Specically, no increased risk for the development of severe maternal adverse events (e.g., postpartum endometritis, pret erm delivery, and preterm premature rupture of membranes) or fetal and neonatal outcomes (e.g., low birth weight, very lo w birth weight, small for gestational age, birth defects, and need for neonatal intensive care unit admission) has been reporte d. However, a small increased risk of chorioamnionitis among Tdap-vaccinated women (relative risk [RR] 1.19, 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.26) was documented in one study ( 89). In another study using the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System database, the majority of these women with chorioamnionitis had at least one risk factor for this complication ( 97). In addition, there was limited supportive evidence for a chorioamnionitis diagnosis on chart review and the risk of preterm birth (a concern after chorioamnionitis) was not higher among Tdap recipients. Therefore, the association between this complica tion and vaccination during pregnancy has been debated. However, a recent study reported a small increase of chorioamnionitis in pregnant women who received Tdap vaccine during pregnancy with a RR of 1.11 (95% CI: 1.07-1.15); but the absolute risk was still quite low, at 2.8% ( 98). Ongoing studies are currently evaluating the potential association between Tda p vaccination during pregnancy and chorioamnionitis. In view of the recommendation to vaccinate against pertussis during ea chpregnancy,ithasbeenshownthatrepeatedTdapvaccinationsi n consecutivepregnanciesarewell-tolerated( 76). Immunogenicity Vaccination against pertussis in pregnancy has been achieved using Tdap formulations that include mostly three or ve B. pertussis antigens. Antibodies against all B. pertussis antigens included in the Tdap vaccine have been shown to reach peak levels at the end of the second week after Tdap administratio n in non-pregnant women of childbearing age, and this peak is followed by a rapid decline ( 99). In pregnant women, studies haveshownasignicantincreasein B.pertussis- specicantibody levels 1 month after Tdap vaccination, also with a signicant decline, within the rst year after maternal vaccination ( 41,100, 101). Thus, the persistence of antibodies after a single dose of Tdapvaccineinpregnancyisshortanddoesnotprobablyensure infant protection during consecutive pregnancies. Therefore , vaccinationiscurrentlyrecommendedineverypregnancy. Vaccination with B. pertussis antigens induces mainly IgG1 antibodies( 102,103)whichareactivelyacrosstheplacentatothe newbornresultinginhigherantibodylevelsinthetermnewb orn thaninthemother( 77,80,104). Pertussis toxin is a major virulence factor of B. pertussis and is potentially responsible for both local and systemic responses ( 105). Administration of humanized neutralizing anti-PT monoclonal antibodies have been shown to abolish disease manifestations in mice and non-human primates (106). Maternal immunization with a monocomponent PT vaccine protected newborn baboons against pertussis followi ng respiratorychallengewith B.pertussis (107).Inhuman,lowanti- PT IgG levels have been associated with high susceptibility t o pertussis ( 108). However, antibody levels that confer protection against human pertussis disease have not been dened. In addition, the number and type of B. pertussis antigens are required for pregnant women in order to provide clinical protectiontotheinfanthasnotbeenclearlyestablished. Timing AstudyconductedinThailandshowedthatvaccinationearli erin pregnancy was associated with higher B. pertussis -specic cord antibody levels ( 109). Furthermore, three other studies found that vaccination during the early third trimester of pregnan cy is associated with higher cord anti- B. pertussis -specic IgG levels than immunization during late third trimester ( 110-112).

In England , vaccine eectiveness was 91% in the reduction of laboratory- conrmed cases in infants <3 months of age signicantly less severe among infants from vaccinated mot hers (119). In Spain, a case-control study reported VE to be 90% against laboratory-conrmed pertussis infection in infant s<3 months of age ( 121), while in Australia it was 69% in infants <3 month of age ( 122). In Brazil, vaccine eectiveness was reported to be 82.6% for the prevention of clinical pertussis in infants <2 months of age, conrming the success of the maternal pertussi s immunizationstrategyalsoinmiddle-incomecountries( 123). Based on the literature review and consultation among authors, a consensus on priorities for future research relat ed to immunization against pertussis during pregnancy was reached(Table6). Vaccines Against Influenza Safety There is an extensive body of evidence in the literature from both HICs and LMICs that conrm the safety of maternal influenza ( 124-129) [reviewed in ( 130)]. During the H1N1 influenza pandemic, data from Sweden and Argentina found that both AS03-adjuvanted and MF59-adjuvanted -H1N1influenza vaccines were not associated with increased risk f or low-birthweightorpretermbirthorlowApgarscore( 131,132). A meta-analysis including studies using both adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted influenza vaccines found lower estimates of still birth after maternal influenza vaccination and no associati on with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion ( 133). However, a small case-control study in the US over two influenza seasons (2010-11,2011-12)foundanincreasedriskofearlyspontane ous abortion in a group of women who had received influenza vaccinationinthersttrimesterofpregnancy,althoughcas eshad other risk factors for spontaneous abortion (older age, pervi ous history of spontaneous abortion, smoking); thus the causal relationshipbetweeninfluenzavaccinationandthiscomplic ation has been questioned ( 134). To further support the safety of influenza vaccination in pregnancy, three Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation funded studies from South Africa ( 135), Mali (136), andNepal( 137),andrecentstudiesandsystematicreviewsfound that maternal influenza vaccination was not associated with an increasedriskoffetaldeath,spontaneousabortion,orcong enital malformations( 138-141). Furthermore, concomitant or sequential vaccination with Tdap and influenza vaccines has also been shown to be safe and notassociatedwithdierencesinmedicallyattendedacutee vents inpregnantwomenoradversebirthoutcomes( 142). Immunogenicity Influenza vaccination preferentially induces IgG1 subclass antibodies ( 143), and studies have shown increased levels of influenza-specic hemagglutinin antibodies in neonates born to women given a monovalent (pH1N1/09) or seasonal TIV during pregnancy, suggesting of influenza-specic antibodies ( 144-146). Importantly, seroconversion rates were lower after administration of TI V in women living with HIV than in women without HIV, and hemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies (HIA) titers wer e lower inHIV-exposedinfants( 146). The kinetics of influenza antibody decline in the infant vary according to the influenza virus and the levels of transferre d antibodies, and thus the duration of protection is not precisel y dened.Somedataindicatethatmaternally-derivedHIAaga inst seasonal influenza viruses have a half-life of approximately 45 days in infants after maternal vaccination and that these antibodies decline to levels similar to those detected in in fants borntounvaccinatedwomenby16weeksofage( 147,148).This is consistent with higher protection from laboratory-conr med influenzadiseaseamonginfantsofvaccinatedmothersdurin gthe rst2-3monthsofage( 135,136). In another study, children born to mothers vaccinated with anadjuvantedpH1N1vaccinehadantibodylevelsthatremaine d elevated above the correlate of protection for adults (HIA ti ter >1:40) up to 5 months ( 149). However, the interpretation of influenza immunogenicity studies are complicated as the correlate of protection against infection in infants has not yet been established and is likely to be dierent and higher than the correlate of protection used for adults ( 150). This is an area of controversy, where more research is needed to dene the correlate(s) of protection against influenza disease in infan ts, Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 9 June 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 1282Abu-Raya et al. Consensus Statement on Immunization During Pregnancy which is important as currently available pediatric influenza vaccines are recommended in certain settings from 6 months o f ageonwards. Timing The optimal timing for maternal influenza immunization has not been established, and recommendations (e.g., CDC, ECDC , WHO) allow administration at any time during pregnancy ( 17, 151,152). Importantly, since influenza is a seasonal disease (except in tropical regions, where influenza disease may occur throughout the year) and the goal of vaccination also serves to protect the mother, the actual determination of timing may depend on factors other than optimizing antibody transfer to the infant. Jackson et al. reported lower antibody levels at b irth in infants of mothers vaccinated earlier during pregnancy ( 144). On the other hand, Sperling et al. did not nd a signicant association between the gestational age at vaccination and the seroconversionratesfollowinginfluenzavaccinationinpre gnant women. However, maternal seroconversion rates were slight ly lower in women immunized in the rst trimester than in those given the vaccine in the late third trimester ( 153). In another study, a higher level of transplacental transfer of antibodi es was associated with a longer interval between vaccination a nd delivery in pregnant women vaccinated against influenza afte r 20 weeks gestation ( 146). Blanchard-Rohner et al. showed that receipt of influenza vaccine at least 2 weeks before delivery increased umbilical cord HIA titers and seroprotection rate s in newborns ( 154). Finally, Katz et al. found no signicant dierences in influenza HIA titers in cord sera of women vaccinated early (17-25 weeks gestation) or later (26-34 we eks gestation)inrandomizedtrialsduringpregnancy( 155). Efcacy Influenza can be a severe disease for pregnant women, neonates and young infants. The severity of infection increases as pregnancy advances, with the greatest maternal risk occurri ng duringthethirdtrimesterofpregnancy( 156,157).Younginfants on the other hand, have been shown to experience the highest rates of influenza-related hospitalization ( 158) and death ( 159) amongchildrenwithinfluenzainfection. Multiple studies have shown that administration of an IIV during pregnancy reduces the risk of influenza in pregnant woman by 35-50% ( 135,160-162). The ecacy of maternal influenza vaccination against laboratory-conrmed influen za in infants below 6 months of age also varies in dierent trials conducted at dierent geographic sites. Ecacy has been (95% Bangladesh Mali Nepal ( 137). Ecacy against laboratory- conrmed influenza in infant was higher in the rst 2-3 months of life and in the range of 70-80% in 2 RCTs from South Africa andMali( 135,136).ObservationalstudiescarriedoutintheUSA (163,164)andEngland( 165),reportedreductionsoflaboratory- conrmed influenza in children born to vaccinated mothers ranged from 41 to 71%. A recent meta-analysis reported that maternal influenza vaccination reduced the risk of laborato ry- conrmedinfluenzainfectionininfantsby48%(95%CI,33-59 )TABLE 7 | Consensus on priorities for future research related to vacc ination against influenza disease during pregnancy.

An analysisofthreeBill&MelindaGatesfoundation-fundedclini cal trialsconductedinNepal,MaliandSouthAfricaincluding10 ,002 mothers and 9801 live-born eligible infants concluded that the pooled incidence rate of severe pneumonia up to 6 months of age was 20% lower in infants born to women vaccinated with IIV compared with infants born to women unvaccinated in pregnancy (incidence rate ratio [IRR]: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.66- 0.99) (167). However, it should be noted that few of these cases had influenza identied despite testing suggesting that influ enza vaccination during pregnancy might have benets beyond the preventionofclassicalinfluenzadisease. TheecacyofIIVinpregnancyinthepreventionofmaternal and infant influenza disease varies depending on the setting as well as the match of the vaccine utilized to circulating influenza strains. The majority of ecacy data are derived fr om studies performed in LMICs when compared to HICs. While influenzadiseaseisseasonalincountrieswithtemperateclim ates (e.g., Europe, North America), there is no seasonal pattern in tropicalcountries.

Other individual countries will have their ownconsiderations. Based on the literature review and consultation among authors, a consensus on priorities for future research realt ed to immunization against influenza during pregnancy was reached(Table7). IMPACT OF MATERNAL IMMUNIZATION ON INFANTS' IMMUNE RESPONSES TO IMMUNIZATION High levels of vaccine-induced maternally-derived antibo dies have the potential to reduce the infants' humoral immune Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 10 June 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 1282Abu-Raya et al. Consensus Statement on Immunization During Pregnancy responsesbyinhibitingantibodygenerationaftertheinfan t'sown vaccination, leading to lower antibody levels/titers late r on in the infant ( 170,171). This phenomenon is called \"interference\" or \"blunting\" and has been described for the same vaccine antigens used by mother and infant, as well as for conjugated vaccines administered in infancy ( 172). Data from the 1990s showed that the administration of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) polysaccharide or Hib conjugated vaccines in pregnant women was associated with mild inhibition of infants' immun e responses to Hib conjugated vaccines ( 173). Dierences in antibody responses in infants born to vaccinated compared with unvaccinated mothers were minimized following the booster dose. An analysis of the genetic repertoire of the lig ht chain of antibodies to the polysaccharide vaccine demonstra ted no dierences between infants born to immunized women compared with non-immunized women ( 174). There was no evidence of inhibition of \"priming\" of the infants' immune systemtoHibinthesestudies. Tetanus-Containing Vaccines Most data on the impact on TT-CVs in infancy are derived from studies that used Tdap formulations in pregnancy and measured anti-TT IgG levels after infant vaccination. Thes e studies found inconsistent results. Some showed signican tly lower anti-TT levels after primary immunization in infants born to Tdap-vaccinated women compared to infants from unvaccinated women whilst other studies showed equal or eve n signicantly higher anti-TT levels in infants born to Tdap- vaccinated women compared to infants from unvaccinated women(77,80,175-177).However,thisinhibitionfoundinsome studies did not result in a reduction of the percentage of infa nts withseroprotectiveanti-TTantibodylevels. TheeectofdierentTT-CVformulationsusedinpregnancy (Tdap vs. TT/Td) on immune responses to tetanus-containing vaccines in infancy is of importance in countries where a replacement of the existing tetanus vaccination program by a Tdap vaccination program is being considered. A small study in Vietnam reported higher anti-TT levels after primary immunization with tetanus-containing vaccines in infants born to Tdap-vaccinated pregnant women compared to infants born to TT-vaccinated pregnant women ( 83). A study from Canada found no dierence in anti-TT levels after primary and booster immunization in infants born to Tdap-vaccinated pregnant women when compared to Td-vaccinated pregnant women (104). These data suggest that Tdap, when compared to TT or Td in pregnancy, is not associated with lower anti-TT IgG leve ls afterprimaryandboosterimmunizationwithtetanus-contai ning vaccines in infancy. However, in order to provide a denite conclusion, formal studies should be conducted with the aim to addressthisquestionastheprimaryoutcome. Several vaccines are conjugated to TT as a carrier protein (e.g., Hib vaccines, meningococcal vaccines) and thus vacc ine- induced immune responses to these vaccines in infant born to Tdap-vaccinated pregnant women might also be aected. Hib anti-polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP) levels were highe r after primary immunization with Hib TT-conjugated vaccinein infants born to Tdap-vaccinated pregnant women when comparedtoinfantsofunvaccinatedmothers( 175,178). Onestudyfoundnodierencesbetweenanti-MenCantibody levels after primary immunization with meningococcal C TT- conjugated vaccine in infant born to Tdap-vaccinated when compared to unvaccinated pregnant women ( 178). More studies are needed to investigate the potential eect of tetanus- containing vaccines administered in pregnancy on infants' immuneresponsetovaccinesconjugatedtoTT. Pertussis Vaccines Studies have shown that Tdap immunization in pregnancy is associated with decreases in humoral immune responses to infants' immunization with acellular pertussis (aP) containi ng vaccines. Several studies describe signicantly lower ant i-PT IgG levels in infants born to Tdap-vaccinated pregnant women after the completion of primary immunization, while results were less consistent after booster immunization ( 77,80,83,104, 175-177). Results from these studies showed also interference to other pertussis antigens (FHA, pertactin, mbria 2/3) afte r primary immunization while results were inconsistent after boosterimmunization. Most studies investigating the potential modication of infants' immune responses to aP vaccines have been performed in HICs, with the exception of one study from Vietnam ( 83, 177). It is important to note that the degree of reduction in immuneresponsestowPinfantvaccinesmightbedierentthan toimmunizationwithaPinfantvaccines.TheuseofwPvaccine s but not aP vaccines was associated with a substantial reduct ion in the subsequent infant antibody response to PT in infants born to mothers with high levels of maternally-derived anti - PT antibodies ( 179). In another study, there was no correlation betweenlowanti- B.pertussis antibodylevelsatdeliveryininfants borntounvaccinatedwomenandtheiranti- B.pertussis antibody levelsafterwPvaccination( 180). ArecentstudyreportedthatThaiinfantsborntounvaccinate d mothers and subsequently vaccinated with wP vaccines, had higher anti- B. pertussis -specic antibody levels after primary and booster vaccination than infants born to women vaccinat ed with Tdap during pregnancy and vaccinated with wP vaccines (181). In addition, infants born to women vaccinated with Tdap in pregnancy and vaccinated with wP vaccines had lower anti- B. pertussis -specic antibody levels after vaccination when compared with infants born to vaccinated mothers and vaccinatedwithaPvaccines( 181). Altogether, these results indicate that infants born to Tda p- vaccinated mothers might be at increased risk for pertussis later in life. However, surveillance data from the US and UK did not demonstrate any increase in the number of pertussis cases later in infancy after the introduction of the materna l immunization program suggesting a possible lack of clinical signicanceofthisinterference( 6).Interpretationofinterference to wP immunization is more challenging in LMICS compared withHICsduetothelackofcomprehensivesurveillancesystem s insomecountries( 182). Because vaccines against pertussis that are currently used in pregnancyalsocontaindT,interferencemightalsobeextende dto Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 11 June 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 1282Abu-Raya et al.

It is also important to note that Tdap immunization in pregnancy, likely due to anti-DT antibodies, is associated with lower anti-pneumococcal caps ular polysaccharide levels after immunization with pneumococcal vaccines (PCVs) conjugated to a non-toxic diphtheria toxin mutant (CRM197), although, this did not result in lower seropotection levels for most serotypes ( 175,183). Surveillance will be key to assess whether this interference has any impact on pneumococcaldiseaseburden. Iflong-termsurveillancedatawouldindicatethatinterfe rence is clinically signicant, strategies to mitigate the eect o f interference will need to be evaluated. Timing of vaccinati on in pregnancy is an important modiable variable and should be investigated. Delaying primary infant vaccination is ano ther approachandhasbeenrecentlyimplementedinTheNetherlands in infants born to Tdap-vaccinated mothers. In addition, sta nd- alone pertussis vaccines (without TT, dT) should be investig ated in clinical trials ( 184) as these vaccines might lessen the concern of interference toTT and DT components and vaccines conjugatedtothoseproteinsascarrierproteins. Influenza Vaccines Dataonthepotentialimpactofmaternalinfluenzaimmunizatio n ontheimmuneresponseofinfantstotheirimmunizationagain st influenza are scarce as influenza vaccines are administered in infants older than 6 months, when most maternally- derived antibodies already have waned from infant's circul ation. Earlier studies performed to assess immunogenicity of influe nza vaccination in infants younger than 6 months old found that post vaccination seroprotection rates (titer 1:40) were higher in infants who received IIV at 6 months of age when compared to infants who received vaccination during 6-12 weeks of age (185). Another prospective, open-label study in which 2 doses of a TIV were administered to healthy infants aged 3-5 months founda4-foldincreaseinantibodytiterstobesignicantl ymore common in children who were seronegative (pre-vaccination titers<1:8) at enrollment than in those with pre-vaccination titers1:8(186). Mechanism of Interference Mechanism of interference between maternally-derived antibodies and infant's immune responses to subsequent immunizationshasnotbeenfullyexplored( 187).Someproposed mechanisms include inhibition of B cell response to vaccine antigens through epitope masking by maternal antibodies ( 172) and neutralization of vaccine antigens ( 187,188). Inhibition of B cell activation through crosslinking of Fc RIIB to the B-cell receptor on B cells has also been proposed. Specically, vaccine antigen-antibody complexes cross-link the B-cell receptor (which recognizes the variable region of the antibody) with the Fcreceptor IIB (which recognizes the constant region of the antibody),thusinhibitingantigenspecicB-cellactivati on(189).Furthermore, vaccine antigen-antibody complexes removal b y macrophages has been suggested although no evidence has been providedtosupportthishypothesis.Usinginfluenzavaccination in pregnancy as a model, it was recently shown in mice that maternal antibodies do not prevent activation of B cells or the formation of the germinal center. However, maternal antibo dies reduced the number of B cells that dierentiate to plasma cells andmemoryBcells( 190).Whethertheseresultsapplytohuman infants and other antigens needs to be determined. Finally, while B cell responses are inhibited in the presence of materna l antibodies,scarcedatasupportthatTcellresponsesaredetect ed inthepresenceofmaternalantibodies( 191). IMPACT OF MATERNAL IMMUNIZATION ON THE NEONATAL IMMUNE SYSTEM The impact of maternal vaccination on the fetal/neonatal immune system, beyond the trans-placental transfer of IgG, h as not been well-studied. In utero priming of the fetal immune systemaftervaccinationagainstinfluenzainpregnancyhasb een reported.IgMantibodiesagainstinfluenzavaccineantigens were detected in nearly 40% of cord blood specimens of newborns born to women vaccinated with IIV in pregnancy ( 192). As IgM antibodiesdonotcrosstheplacenta,theseantibodiesareof fetal ( 192). Additional studies are needed to further assess the possibil ity of priming of fetal immune system to B. pertussis antigens after immunizationinpregnancy. Based on the literature review and consultation among authors, a consensus on priorities for future research relat ed to theeectofimmunizationduringpregnancyoninfants'immune responseswasreached( Table8). FUTURE VACCINES FOR IMMUNIZATION DURING PREGNANCY In addition to tetanus containing, pertussis containing and influenza vaccines currently used in pregnancy, multiple novel GBS and RSV candidate vaccines are under development for use in pregnant women ( 193). Infection with other pathogens (e.g., dengue virus, Zika virus) during pregnancy is associa ted with a signicant risk of adverse fetal outcome ( 194-196), and thusvaccinesdevelopedwiththegoaltopreventthesecongeni tal infections might prove to be an important preventative strateg y. However,thesenotpartofthisconsensuspaperandarereviewed elsewhere( 197,198). Group BStreptococcus Vaccines GBS colonization in pregnant women is associated with an increased risk of premature birth, birth asphyxia, stillbirth s, and invasive GBS disease in newborns during the rst week of life (early-onset disease, EOD). Newborns of mothers coloni zed with GBS are at higher risk of developing meningitis and sepsis (199).Althoughintrapartumantibioticprophylaxisiseectivein Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 12 June 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 1282Abu-Raya et al.

Importantly, identication and treatment of colonized moth ers can be dicult and expensive, particularly in LMICs, where the incidenceofneonatalinvasiveGBSdiseaseishighercompare dto HICs (201). Development of GBS vaccines for immunization in pregnancy and its use in LMICs has been identied as a priority bytheWHO( 202). Vaccines based on the capsular polysaccharide of the most common GBS strains conjugated to a carrier protein (e.g., TT or a non-toxic mutant of diphtheria toxin) are the most studied candidate vaccines ( 203). A recent systematic review of clinical trials evaluating candidate GBS vaccines concl uded that these candidate GBS vaccines are safe and well-tolerat ed in pregnant women and non-pregnant adults, may reduce vaginal colonization and induce antibody titers against the GBS str ains included in the vaccine at a signicantly higher level than t hat detected in unvaccinated controls ( 203). Moreover, antibodies induced by GBS vaccines showed high longevity and were able topromoteGBSopsonophagocytosis invitro(203). Several challenges for the development of GBS vaccines for maternal immunization remain unsolved. There are only 10 known GBS serotypes, of which 6 are associated with 98% of all described strains that cause invasive disease and even a tri valent vaccine (Ia, Ib, and III) would provide coverage for 80% of all global invasive disease cases ( 204). The prevalence of dierent GBS serotypes may vary in dierent countries, however, themost common serotypes (Ia, Ib, II, III, and V) are dominant globally,withonlyAsiareportingaslightlyhigherproportio nof casesduetooneadditionalserotype(VII)( 205).Thedistribution ofserotypesresponsibleforearlyandlate-onsetGBSdiseasea lso varies, with the most common serotypes being III and Ia ( 206). Correlates of protection for the dierent GBS serotypes agains t the various clinical conditions associated with the pathoge n (i.e., colonization, maternal and infant disease) are not pre cisely dened (207), and these correlates may vary by serotype ( 207). Furthermore, transplacental transfer of antibodies might be aected by the characteristics of the vaccine (conjugated vs . unconjugated), the carrier protein used for conjugation, and the presence of underlying diseases in the mother which can reduc e transfer,suchasHIVinfection( 208). Phase 1b/2 clinical trials have shown that vaccination of pregnant women with a trivalent GBS vaccine (serotype III, Ia, and Ib conjugated to CRM197) induces anti-GBS antibodies that are transferred to the newborn at delivery ( 208-210). Other phase 1/2 clinical trials are currently evaluating multi-ser otype vaccines, including a hexavalent vaccine (serotypes Ia, Ib, II, III, IV, V) that cover 98% of strains associated with invasive GBS disease in both a non-pregnant population (NCT03170609) and inpregnantwomen(NCT03765073). Finally, the clinical eectiveness of GBS vaccines in pregnan t women and neonates has not been determined. Considering the relatively low incidence of invasive GBS disease, especia lly in HICs, the pathway of licensure of a GBS vaccine targeted at pregnant women with the main objective of protection of their infants against early and late-onset invasive GBS diseas e is likely to require an alternate approach than conventional ecacy trials. This would include demonstrating the safety o f thevaccineinpregnantwomen( 3,000-4,500participants),and benchmarkingtheirimmuneresponsestoaserologicalendpoin t IgG (us ing astandardizedassay)andthresholdassociatedwith80-90% risk reductionforinvasiveGBSdisease. As current GBS vaccines that are under development are conjugatedtoTTortheDTmutantCRM197,itwillbeimportant to investigate whether these vaccines given to pregnant wome n may result in interference to infant vaccines conjugated to these carrier proteins and given in infancy (e.g., PCV, Hib, and Meningococcal vaccines). Current evidence suggests tha t CRM197-conjugatedGBSvaccineadministeredinpregnancydid notaectinfants'immuneresponsestoPCVs( 211). Respiratory Syncytial Virus RSV is the most common cause of severe lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in young children worldwide with a disproportionate high burden of disease in LMICs (e.g., higher case-fatality rate) ( 212). Preterm infants and infants with underlying severe chronic heart or lung disease are at higher risk of severe RSV infection, leading to hospitalizati on and death. A monoclonal antibody directed against the RSV fusion(F)proteinhasbeenadministeredtohigh-riskpopulatio ns to prevent RSV-related morbidity in infants in high-income Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 13 June 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 1282Abu-Raya et al. Consensus Statement on Immunization During Pregnancy countries ( 213,214). However, this strategy is highly expensive and its eectiveness varies ranging between 48 and 96% in the prevention of RSV-related hospitalization in high-risk children ( 215,216). In addition, overall more healthy children are infected with RSV each year than high-risk children. A novel prolonged half-life anti-RSV monoclonal antibody may prove to be more eective in preventing RSV disease in infancy(217). Recently, several new vaccines, including live-attenuated , gene-based vector vaccines, and particle-based vaccines, h ave been developed and found to be safe and well-tolerated in the non-pregnant population ( 11,193). Hence, as most of the cases of severe RSV infection occur in the rst 3 months of life, it is unlikely that infants' immunization can provide sucie nt and timely protection. Therefore, maternal immunization is considered as a suitable strategy for prevention of RSV diseas e inyounginfants( 11,218). Studies on RSV-F protein in pregnant women have shown that these vaccines are safe and immunogenic in pregnant women ( 219,220). The use of these RSV vaccines in healthy pregnant women is further supported by evidence that maternal RSV neutralizing antibodies are eciently transferred from the mother to the newborn, with levels at delivery that are simila r or higher in the cord blood compared with the maternal blood at delivery ( 219,220). However, the association between higher cord RSV neutralizing antibody levels and the reduction of risk for RSV LRTI in the infant is not clear, and no denitive correlates of protection have been dened so far ( 221-223). VaccinescontainingtheRSV-Fproteininpregnant women have shownthatthesevaccinesaresafeandimmunogenicinpregnan t women(219,220). A phase 3, randomized, placebo controlled trial including 4,636 pregnant women has been conducted in 11 countries withaRSV-Fnanoparticlealum-adjuvantedvaccineshowedtha t protection against RSV LRTI hospitalization was noted (44.4% vaccine ecacy, 95%CI: 19.6 to 61.5), but the primary study endpoint (per protocol analysis) for reduction of medically- signicantRSVLRTI(39%vaccineecacy;97.5%CI: 1to63.7) wasnotmet(albeitthe95%CIbeen5.3to61.2)( 224).Thisisthe largest study so far to evaluate a vaccine primarily designed f or useinpregnantwomen. Multiple factors could have aected the outcomes measured in this rst immunization study of a RSV vaccine in pregnancy. Pregnantwomenwerevaccinatedduring28-36weeksgestatio n, and eciency of transfer of anti-RSV antibodies were found to be higher in women vaccinated <30 weeks GA compared with women vaccinated 30 weeks GA. In addition, vaccine ecacy varied in dierent settings, being higher in middle-income countries (compared with HICs). Mathematical modeling can help predict women and infants who are expected to benet the most from RSV vaccines. This could be achieved by dening women who are expected to deliver in RSV season and the preferred timing of vaccination to optimize protection in thos e infants. Ideal timing of vaccination could be predicted base d on the kinetics of antibody response in mothers, the eciency of antibody transfer and their estimated half-life, and durati on of infants'exposuretoseasonalRSV.TABLE 9 | Consensus on priorities for future research related to vacc ines against respiratory syncytial virus and Group B Streptococcus diseases during pregnancy.

INDUCTION OF VACCINE-SPECIFIC IMMUNITY IN BREASTMILK There is a paucity of information on the induction of antibodi es in breastmilk following vaccination in pregnancy ( 225). Anti- B. pertussis secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) antibodies were detected in colostrum and in breast milk up to 8 weeks after delivery from women vaccinated with Tdap during pregnancy (226,227). However, the clinical signicance of these elevated B. pertussis -specic antibody concentrations in breastmilk has not been studied. A study from Bangladesh showed that vaccination with TIV in pregnancy induced influenza-specic sIgA levels in breastmilk for at least 6 months postpartum. In addition,breastfeedingwasassociatedwithadecreaseine pisodes of respiratory illness with fever in infants born to mothers vaccinated against influenza during pregnancy ( 228). A study from South Africa found that breastmilk sIgA against GBS was associatedwithlowerriskforGBSLODinyounginfants( 229).In astudyfromNepal,breastmilkRSVIgGlevels,butnotIgAlevel s, were lower in mothers of infants with RSV acute respiratory infection ( 230).

Mechanisms of protection against respiratory pathogens through breastmilk ACCEPTANCE AND STRATEGIES FOR INCREASING UPTAKE OF VACCINES The acceptance and coverage of immunization against tetanus during pregnancy in LMICs have been historically high (231). Despite recommendations by multiple health authorities worldwide, maternal immunization with influenza and pertuss is vaccines has not been as widely accepted by healthcare worker s orthegeneralpublic,includingpregnantwomen( 232).Coverage remains suboptimal in many countries where recommendations formaternalimmunizationwithinfluenzaandpertussisvacci nes have been in place for several years. In the US, influenza and pertussis vaccines have been recommended for all pregnant women since 2004 ( 233) and 2011 ( 234), respectively. However, during the 2017-2018 influenza season, only 49.1% of pregnant women received the influenza vaccine during the peak influenza season (235). During the same months, maternal Tdap uptake was only slightly higher (54.4%). Finally, the receipt of both vaccines was documented in only 32.8% of pregnant women (235). In the UK, where pertussis vaccine has been oered to all pregnant women since October 1, 2012, coverage during the periodfromApriltoJune2018was68.2%( 236).IntheEuropean Union, although 90% of countries recommend vaccination against influenza for pregnant women, coverage was generally low in 2014-2015, with half of the countries reporting uptake of<10% (237). In France, during the 2015-16 season vaccine coverage was only 7.4% ( 238). In Switzerland influenza and pertussis immunizations in pregnancy have been recommended since 2009 and 2013, respectively. Yet, in a study performed in womenwhogavebirthbetween2013and2017,onlyve(3%)of 172 mothers had received both pertussis and influenza vaccine s during pregnancy, 15 (9%) only against pertussis and 12 (7%) onlyagainstinfluenza( 239). Several factors can explain the poor compliance with the ocialrecommendations.Arecentliteraturereviewdocume nted 25 individual patient-level and 24 healthcare provider-level barriers to maternal immunization uptake ( 240). Among the patient-identied barriers, concerns regarding safety for the mother or the newborn were very common and were cited in 6.4-71% and 2.9-77.0% of studies, respectively. Other vaccin e and disease-related factors included concerns about vacci ne ecacy, the belief that the disease was not suciently sever e to require prevention, and the idea that healthy people did not need immunization. Moreover, several structural and logist icalTABLE 11 | Consensus on priorities for future research related to acce ptance and strategies for increasing uptake of vaccines administered during pregnancy.

The need of adequate education of health-care providers on m aternal immunization and establishing a consensus on a minimum curr iculum to be achieved during (para)medical education The need of global information and awareness-raising campa igns How to best inform pregnant women about new vaccines The effectiveness of different strategies to increase influe nza and pertussis vaccination coverage in pregnant women in different region s and cultures To analyze similarities and differences in knowledge and at titudes to influenza and pertussis vaccination during pregnancy barriers were identied. Lack of insurance coverage, limit ed access or transportation, and the diculty of nding a provide r for vaccine administration were reported. Finally, social, psychological factors, and insucient knowledge were liste d repeatedly. Among the provider-level barriers, poor knowledge of the recommendations for immunization of pregnant women, nancial concerns (inadequate reimbursement, payment, and/or complexity of billing), and inability to order, obtain and store vaccines. Globally, the lack of knowledge of vaccine recommendations seems to be the most important barrier for both health care workers (HCWs) (241-246) and pregnant women ( 247-252). HCWs in contact with pregnant women frequently have little experience in vaccines and therefore do not oer vaccinations to pregnant women(239,253). To overcome barriers to maternal immunization, both provider-focused and mother-focused interventions have been suggested, with a signicant improvement in vaccine uptake has been evidenced in several cases ( 253). Suggested provider-focused interventions were notifying the provider of the vaccination status of pregnant women, establishing standing orders authorizing nursing sta to administer the vaccines without a medical consultation, giving provider feedback by reporting the vaccination rates of other institutions, and providing education to improve the knowledge and attitudes of HCWs toward vaccination in pregnancy. However, education of HCWs alone is probably ineective if parental vaccine hesitancy is not addressedsimultaneously. Multiple educational eorts involving all HCWs who deliver care to pregnant women and the pregnant women themselves can yield positive results ( 254). This observation seems to have been conrmed by a study by Chamberlain et al., who showed that when obstetricians and women became familiar with the recommendation to promote and receive the influenza vaccine during pregnancy, the percentage of women who refused to be vaccinated declined from 88.9% in 2004 to 64.2% in 2011 (254). To overcome barriers in pregnant women, studies were planned to disseminate education and promotion of materials specically for pregnant women by mass media campaigns Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 15 June 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 1282Abu-Raya et al. Consensus Statement on Immunization During Pregnancy via the internet, posters and leaflets, lectures and workshops , and personalized reminders and recall system ( 254). Integrating maternal immunization into routine obstetric care, with va ccine availability within the obstetrical setting, appears to be th e best method of improving maternal immunization as well as subsequentchildhoodvaccineuptake( 255). Based on the literature review and consultation among authors, a consensus on priorities for future research relat ed to acceptance and uptake of vaccines administered during pregnancywasreached( Table11). CONCLUSIONS Pregnant women, their newborns and young infants are vulnerable to serious and potentially fatal infections. The new WHO goals aim to increase rates of live births and improve antenatal care for pregnant women ( 256), and vaccination in pregnancy is one strategy to improve health of pregnant women and their ospring. Safe and eective vaccines are already available against some diseases (tetanus, pertussi s and influenza) for use during pregnancy, and these vaccines have the potential to prevent signicant infectious disease morbi dity and mortality in both the mothers and their ospring. In addition, new vaccines (e.g., RSV, GBS) are currently under developmentandarebeingtestedinclinicaltrials,tobelic ensed and used in pregnant women. Following literature review and a consultation amongst experts in the elds of infectious diseases, vaccination and immunization during pregnancy, several gaps in knowledge and priorities for research were identied and are proposed ( Tables3-11). Addressing these priorities in future research has the potential to increase ou runderstanding in dierent aspects of immunization during pregnancy and optimize protection for both the mother and theinfant.
