Given the high rates of mycotoxin in poultry feed, a mycotoxin risk management strategy is needed to reduce the challenges in poultry production and ensure profitability. Poultry producers frequently ask: What is the real impact of mycotoxins on the broiler's productivity? What sounds like an easy question is, in the case of mycotoxins, unfortunately not so easy to answer. Three key considerations to evaluate the impact of mycotoxins on a poultry farm: Mycotoxins are frequently found in poultry feed. According to the [dsm-firmenich World Mycotoxin Survey](/anh/products-and-services/tools/mycotoxin-contamination/biomin-mycotoxin-survey.html), more than 33,000 analysis of finished poultry feed tested positive for mycotoxins in the last ten years (2013 - 2023). A closer analysis of this data shows that 83% of these samples are contaminated with more than one mycotoxin (Figure 1) and as many as 50 mycotoxins were found in a single sample. Exposure to multiple mycotoxins at the same time can often lead to more severe effects on health and performance of birds. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to measure a panel of mycotoxins to have a more robust risk evaluation (Figure 2). Testing the finished feed and/or their ingredients helps to evaluate the risk for the bird's health. The frequent presence of mycotoxins triggers the gut health and immune system of the animals, consequently reducing the performance of the flocks, what can be translated as a loss of profit for poultry producers. The lack of visible clinical signs is primarily due to the short life cycle of broilers. This means that the challenge may lurk within the animal, but not have time to manifest outwardly. The combined effects of more than one mycotoxin make the diagnosis more difficult. However, the major impacts of mycotoxins on in poultry health and have been clearly proven: destruction of the villus of the intestines which harms nutrient absorption and digestion while increasing leaky gut and modulation of the local immune response and the microbiota which increases the opportunity for vaccine failure and dysbiosis. By mitigating mycotoxin risk, the opportunity for 'leaky gut' is minimized further supporting the production of safe poultry products. Performance is one of the most important factors in poultry production profitability. A data compilation of scientific trials has shown that the presence of mycotoxins in poultry diets significantly reduced (P < 0.05) feed intake by 12% and body weight gain (BWG) by 14%, resulting in an impaired feed conversion ratio (FCR) of 7% when compared with non-contaminated groups (Andretta et al, 2011). Furthermore, results from a cooperation project with the University of Ghent (Antonissen et al., 2018) show a synergistic negative effect between a dysbiosis challenged diet and additional DON (5 mg/kg) and FB1 (20 mg/kg) on broilers' performance. These data demonstrate that the reduction in performance is sustained through the final phase of production. (Figure 4). In a long-term evaluation (18 successive trials) of a commercial farm, it was shown that natural contamination with levels below the EU recommendations for mycotoxins has a significant impact of 2.5 points in FCR (Figure 5), confirming the synergistic effects of the mycotoxins (fumonisins, zearalenone, DON and DAS) and the decreased broiler performance in commercial conditions (Kolawole et al., 2020). Mycotoxins have direct and indirect effects on coccidiosis, food safety, and broiler performance which directly influence the profitability of the producer. Due to the frequent occurrence of mycotoxins in poultry feed, a mycotoxin risk management strategy is needed to protect broilers in all phases and ensure profitability. DSM offers the most comprehensive solution on the market: Our survey which is longest running and most comprehensive data set on mycotoxin occurrence to give insights on which mycotoxins maybe present in your feed, our analytical services to support mycotoxin detection in your ingredients, and our [Mycofix\u00ae](/anh/products-and-services/products/mycotoxin-deactivators/mycofix.html) portfolio of feed additives which represent the most state-of-the-art solution for protecting bird health by deactivating mycotoxins that contaminate feed.
