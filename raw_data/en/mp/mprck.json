Crystel owns a private practice named Latch and is board certified for lactation consultations. She has a passion for assisting families and empowering them with knowledge and tools they need for their lactation journey. An IBCLC is the only recognized professional breastfeeding qualification. All IBCLCs have demonstrated an average of 1,000 clinical hours and completed at least 90 hours of advanced lactation education. An IBCLC is also required to sit for a board exam, and recertify every five years. In other words, when you reach out to an IBCLC, you are arming yourself with the best available breastfeeding support. Crystel is married and is a mom of two beautiful children: Jack (9), Elizabeth (6), and her Pug Winnie. Crystel provided human milk for both of her babies, but had difficulty feeding at the breast with both children. During her nursing journey, her interest in helping mothers breastfeed began to grow. Crystel has a long history (18 years) in healthcare. Mostly centered towards postpartum care. Her experience includes postpartum nursing in a local downtown Des Moines hospital, an OB/GYN clinic, Family Medicine, and had an internship with a private practice midwife. She began her career in healthcare at the age of 16 as a nurse assistant, and then became a nurse in 2009. Things she enjoys in her free time include: spending time with her kids and husband, photography, being outdoors, boat rides, traveling, sushi, and coffee in any form. \"Mothers milk is perfect for her baby. There is nothing more unique and beautiful than being able to assist with nourishing the mind and body of an infant or toddler.\" Crystel has a state of the art TANITA lactation scale that she will utilize for weighted feeds. This scale is so accurate- down to the gram! She will collaborate with the providers at IFM to keep them up to date as well. ----------------------------- When should I have my first appointment with a lactation consultant? Whether you're expecting your first baby, or you've welcomed one before, visiting with an International Board-Certified Lactation Consultant (IBCLC for short) before your baby arrives can help you prepare to breastfeed or provide expressed milk. Here are some answers to common questions about prenatal breastfeeding visits. Why should you visit a lactation consultant before delivery? Breastfeeding is the natural conclusion to pregnancy and birth. But \"natural\" doesn't always mean \"easy\"! Breastfeeding is a skill that takes some time for both parent and baby to learn, and each breastfeeding pair is unique. Breastfeeding is a skill, passed along between generations, and that link has been broken for a lot of families. Education during pregnancy for lactation is one way we can continue to pass along knowledge of breastfeeding and caring for a new baby. Prenatal breastfeeding education can take many forms such as books, breastfeeding classes, support groups like those coming to IFM, browsing trusted websites, YouTube, and talking to your midwife or provider. Another option is having a one-on-one visit with a board certified lactation consultant to discuss any specific questions or concerns you have. What will you talk about? During these prenatal consults, the IBCLC will cover what to expect prior to delivery, the golden hour, the first few days after birth, and may cover other topics, such as using a breast pump, depending upon what you want to know! The goal of this appointment is to help you feel prepared and increase your confidence, so your lactation expert will talk about the topics that matter most to you, after covering the basics. Who should have a prenatal breastfeeding visit? Anyone who is expecting a baby, no matter how long you're planning to breastfeed or pump, can benefit from a prenatal breastfeeding visit. Partners and other support people are welcome to come along; they can ask questions and hear the same expert information, so everyone understands what to expect once your baby is born. There are some cases where a prenatal breastfeeding visit is highly recommended: What should you bring to the visit? Bring your questions and concerns to us at IFM. Many people bring a written list of things they're curious about, such as advice they've heard from friends or family. If you have a breast pump, bring that along with you and we can show you how to put it together, and find the correct size flange. Lastly, bring your nursing pillow if you have one. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Reasons to see an IBCLC: 1. Prenatal breastfeeding education: An IBCLC can help identify any potential issues that would complicate breastfeeding and review any advanced questions and concerns that you may have.
