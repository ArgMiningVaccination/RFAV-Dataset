Background: Disorders of the respiratory transition at birth are major reasons for neonates being admitted to intensive care units and separated from their mothers. This has potential long-lasting consequences for the mother-infant interaction as well as the long-term development of the child. There is an urgent need for effective preventive and therapeutic measures for this frequent disorder. Case Report: We report the cases of 2 newborn infants with respiratory transitional disorder treated off-label with the anthroposophic medicament Pulmo/Vivianit comp. based on pathophysiological considerations and on particular parental request. In both cases, an immediate and sustainable response could be documented without adverse effects. Conclusion: This new therapeutic approach merits further attention in clinical research but cannot be recommended for routine practice before more high-level evidence is available.", "sitename": "Karger Publishers", "date": "2017-06-23", "cleaned_text": "Summary Background: Disorders of the respiratory transition at birth are major reasons for neonates being admitted to intensive care units and separated from their mothers.
