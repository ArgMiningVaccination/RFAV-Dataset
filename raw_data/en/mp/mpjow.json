Defining the Enemy Darrell, a 62- year- old male patient has been admitted to the hospital for respiratory distress after an exacerbation of his COPD during flu season. He also has uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and a lower lobe pneumonia. He has been on a ventilator (assist control) for five days. He is receiving antibiotics for the pneumonia. Upon completion of the morning asse ssment, the nurse notices a thick white coating on his tongue and mouth and around the endotracheal tube. She plans to provide oral care several times during her shift. Later in the day she notices that the white coating on the tongue is difficult to scrape off but thinks it is just a stubborn film on his tongue. Or is it something more? Did you recognize the clinical signs of an oral yeast infection ? What risk factors did Darrell have to increase the development of oral candida? What tests are done to diagnose candida? What are the causes? How is it transmitted? Is it infectious? What are the different types of yeast infections? What is the nurse's role in treating fungal infections ? What prevention and treatment strategies are available? What is the role of health care professionals in helping people avoid common yeast infections? Do you have yeast in and on your body? If so, is it in control? If you struggled to answer these questions, we will discuss each of these issues to prepare you to begin your own assault against candida yeast infections. Yeasts That Infect Yeast infections are a lso known as fungal infections and are caused by the fungus candida . Yeast are single celled organisms and classified in the biology Kingdom Fungus , which also includes mushrooms and molds. It is different from other microorganisms such as bacteria, proto zoa, and amoeba. Candida is the genus level name for a fungus, and there are more than 150 different kinds of candida (McCombs, n.d.). Healthcare workers are often mo re familiar with Candida albicans , a common fungal skin infection, but there are dozens of variations and types of fungal infections. A very serious fungus that has developed a resistance to current antifungal treatments is called Candida auris . It is because of this growing threat within hospitals and for long -term care patients, that there is a need for healthcare workers to be better informed about candida. ATrain Education 707 459- 1315 Page 4 of 31 Candida auris Source: NHS.UK. Most fungi dwell normally within and on -top of the human body creating a natural competitor against normal bacteria, which is also on and in the body. C andida is known as an opportunistic microbe, and given the right opportunity, candida yeast can become overgrown and cause an infection ( V\u00e1zquez -Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2013 ). When the normal human environment is disrupted, and the human immune system is diminished candidiasis may result. Candidiasis is any fungal infection due to any type of candida that has become out of control in the human body (Huether & McCance, 2008). Fungal disorders are also called mycoses and when caused by a topical fungus affecting the epidermis, the disorder of the skin is called tinea . The second Latin name identifies the area of the body infected ; consider Tinea capitus , which Tinea corporis infection body; Tinea pedis , which is a fungal infection of the feet. Other names for candida include moniliasis and oidomycosis . Candida albicans is a gram -positive budding yeast, and of more than twenty types of fungal infections it is the most common. Like other opportunistic pathologic yeast, Candida albicans is found in humans where ideal growth environments exist. Candida exists as normal flora in the human intestines. It grows within the gastrointestinal tract from the mouth through the small intestines and is found in the mouth of up to 60% of healthy adults (Erdogan & Rao, 2015). Albicans is one of the most common fungal species to be isolated on medical devices and on human tissues. It is one of several forms that cause candidiasis. The other five most common forms of candida are C. tropicalis , and C. , which combined are responsible for up to 90% of all human candidiasis (Martins et al., 201 4). ATrain Education 707 auris , another type of yeast, has become drug resistant and is spreading in healthcare facilities, quickly becoming a serious concern. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) track candid a infections through hospital reporting, in order to understand the transmission, incidence, and susceptibility to treatment. When any pathogen begins to become resistant to current medications, the CDC becomes actively engaged in tracking and creating sta ndard guidelines for treatment across the nation.

ATrain Education 707 459- 1315 Page 7 of 31 Skin yeast infections can als o appear as a red, flat rash with scalloped edges. Satellite lesions are extensions of the original yeast that grow to extend the rash. As noted above, tinea infections are identified by their location on the body. Pathology of Candida Candida are organi sms that can be dimorphic or polymorphic, meaning their shape can appear as a single cell or become more pathologic with multiple extensions or filaments from a cell. Candida yeasts are part of the normal pathogens on the body, found on the skin and throug hout the intestinal flora, and are kept within ideal limits by natural competition from other microorganisms such as bacteria. Yeast grow best in humans under conditions of warmth, moisture, and access to sugar for energy. Skin folds that are warm and moist such as the mouth, genitals, or a baby's diaper region, are ideal reservoirs for yeast growth. Skin folds of obese people, such as under breasts or armpits, are common growth areas for candida. The vagina of femal es is also an ideal location for yeast overgrowth given the right conditions. Yeast prefer sugar for food and grow well with diets high in sugar, such as in people with diabetes mellitus and uncontrolled blood sugar levels. Did You Know. . . Not all yeas ts grow in warm areas; consider the mol d that grows on your refrigerated food that has been kept too long. Yeast cells can be seen in different morphologies , or appearances. When they appear ovoid under a microscope they are known as yeast cells. If they look like a cactus with multiple branc hes, they are known as hyphae ; when they are a combination of both round cells and elongated growths , they are called pseudo hyphae . Pseudo Hyphae of Commons. ATrain Education 707 459- 1315 Page 8 of 31 When the yeast is in round cells, the cells can move easily to different areas of the body; whereas, when they are in hyphae mode, the filaments can more easily invade surrounding body tissues and create a broader infection. Yeast ge nerally prefers to live on the skin and mucus membranes. When it grows out of control, it impacts the squamous epithelium of the top layer of the skin. Yeast can destroy skin cells and keratin and deposit its own protein layer, which appears as a white cot tage- cheese -like appearance , as seen in vaginal and oral infections. As it destroys topical skin or mucus layers of the host, it is known as pseudomembranous candidiasis . This is more common in those with a weakened immune system, such as infants and eld ers; those who are immunosuppressed (su ch as those with diabetes or HIV/AIDS); or those taking medications that may suppress the immune system, such as inhaled steroids, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy. Another condition is called erythematous candidiasis , which is due to a change in the level of competition between yeast and normal bacteria. Taking antibiotics or smoking can decrease normal colonizing levels of bacteria but not have a negative impact on yeast, so the yeast cells grow out of control. The bo dy's normal first reaction to any overg rowth is inflammation and an increase in blood flow to the area to deliver antibodies and oxygen. The result is a reddened and painful skin area from vasodilation. The pain is due to the swelling tissues that push on the nerve endings. When identifying c haracteristics of yeast, in addition to the morphology, is the existence of adhesins , which make the yeast stick to surface areas. Adhesins are made of glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol, which has surface sticky glycoproteins that allow it to adhere to the surface of other microorganisms and inorganic surfaces. Invasins * allow the yeast to invade other tissues such as epithelial tissues and cells of the skin. *Invasins, a class of proteins associated with the penetration of pathogens into host cells. Invasin s play a role in promoting entry during the initial stage of infection. In addition to the typical body locations of the mouth, esophagus, skin, and vagina, yeast becomes dangerous when growing on mechanical devices such as central venous catheters used b y patients in hospital and long -term medical facilities. The candida forms a biofilm on the catheter and devices and can prolong a hospital stay. The biofilm can also break off and move to other areas. If it enters the bloodstream, it can become septic for the patient. Depending on where the mechanical device is, the yeast may have easy a ccess to heart valves, kidneys, and the brain. Additionally, candida secretes hydrolases such as protease, phospholipase, and lipase, which break down cells of the host a nd make it easy to penetrate and take up nutrients from the host environment. An exa mple is intestinal candida that becomes overgrown, causing post -meal abdominal bloating and fatigue as the yeast grow and use up resources from the host. Metabolic adaptation is flexible for candida, as they will consume energy from food sources in the g ut of the host or can create new fuel through gluconeogenesis. When an overgrowth of yeast occurs, it is said the yeast colonize and then invade human tissue or mucous and can dangerously pass into the bloodstream. ATrain Education 707 459- 1315 Page 9 of 31 Friendly Yeast Not all yeast is bad. If you have ever baked bread from \"scratch,\" you will recall that you add a tablespoon of baker's yeast to warm water and a tablespoon of sugar. If the water is too hot the y east won't grow, and the mixture will make flat, hard bread. With the right temperat ure of warm water, in just minutes you see bubbles forming as the yeast become activated. These yeast organisms begin to digest the sugar and release gas, accounting for the bubbles. If you add salt, the reaction begins to slow down; yeasts are killed by s alt, which disrupts their cell structures. Upon adding flour and other ingredients, the yeast continues to grow until it is ready to be baked. The high baking temperature k ills the yeast and the growth stops. In essence, this process of using yeast to ba ke bread is similar to the yeast growth within and on our own bodies. Given a warm and moist climate, yeast grow. When exposed to natural competitors, such as bacteria, yea st is held at bay. If deprived of warmth, moisture, and sugar, they cannot flourish. This process suggests strategies for prevention, which we'll discuss later. Curative Power of Yeast: Penicillin Now the positive side of yeast must be told. Yeast are a vital organism in the mix of our gastrointestinal normal flora that help with our di gestion of food. Yeast was also key to the discovery of their effectiveness against bacteria, which can harm us. In 1928, Alexander Fleming is known for his discovery of the effectiveness of the penicillin mold against bacteria. How he discovered a \"cure\" against staphylococcus bacteria was due to yeast. As a Scottish bacteriologist in London, he was studying the bacteria on an agar growth plate that he placed by an open lab oratory window at London's St. Mary's Hospital. Days later he realized a blue -green mold yeast, known as Penicillium notatum, had blown through the window and contaminated the petri dish. Upon further examination, he saw that the yeast had grown onto the b acteria and killed it and there was a clear ring or around the yeast where bacteria couldn't grow (Newman, 2019). Believing that penicillin would not last long enough in humans to kill bacteria, he looked for help in purifying the promising drug. The re search continued in 1934 at Oxford University by advanced scientists Howard Florey, Ernst Chain, and Norman Heatley, who were able to purify and test it successfully in mice, and then in humans. Thankfully, the combined efforts of scientists and yeast produced a huge blessing to mankind \u2014penicillin, which effectively kills harmful bacterial infections. Ironically, in the Nobel Prize acceptance speech of Alexander Fleming, he warned that overuse of the penicillin may lead to bacterial resistance, which has since occurred. In summary, yeast can be both foe and friend. Apply Your Knowledge How would you explain both the advantages and disadvantages of yeast? ATrain Education 707 459- 1315 Page 10 of 31 2. The Incidence and Prevalence of Candida History of Candida Reports of candida yeast infections have been seen in human literature for more than 2400 years; because of its multiform characteristics, it has endured for millennia. The Father of Medicine, Hippocrates, cited symptoms and treatments for fungus in 377 C.E. The most common yeast, Candida a lbicans, was first named in 1923 by doctoral student Christine Marie Berhout of the Netherlands (McCoombs, n.d.). After the discovery by Alexander Fleming of the effectiveness of penicillin yeast against bacteria, research and studies in candida have grow n tremendou sly in the twentieth century. As penicillin and other antibiotics became prevalent and even overused, candida infections also became more common as a side effect from removing the natural competitor of bacteria. Now as types of candida have be come more threatening and resistant to antifungals (eg, Candida auris) , studies are searching for better solutions. The Cost of Candida Infections Candida albicans is known as the fourth- most overall infectious agent in hospitals (CDC, 2019c). It is also known as the most common yeast isolated from clinical specimens in superficial and systemic infections (Magill, 2018). The reported cases of candidemia and candidiasis reveal that approximately 9 per 100,000 people in the United States will develop candid emia, which is the most invasive form of candidiasis because it enters the blood. Other yeast infections of the heart, kidney, and bones may not be easily detected as they are not in the blood and, according to CDC, the statistics and incidence of candidia sis and candidemia may actually be higher. Since 2008 the CDC has surveyed candida bloodstream infections through a program called the Emerging Infections Program (EIP). This includes state health departments in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia , Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Oregon and Tennessee, in collaboration with their local laboratories, academic institutions, and public health and healthcare facilities. The CDC and its partners receive reports from these agencies about cases of candidemia within their states. A current list of the counties within each state that are submitting reports can be found at the CDC website. National trends revealed that the incidence of candidemia stabilized during 2009- 2013 demonstrating the effec tiveness of hospital policies and procedures involving catheter care (Cleveland et al., 2015). Interestingly, the trends are geographic and reveal that states with higher numbers and practices of injection drug use see higher incidences of candidemia. ATrain Education 707 459- 1315 Page 11 of 31 Candidiasis Invasive Statistics Source: CDC. Candidemia rates are highest in adults age 65 and older and twice as high in black s as in non-blacks (CDC, 2019c). Socioeconomic status and underlying health conditions may explain the difference. There has also been a decline in reports of candida in i nfants younger than 1 year old, and it is hypothesized that is due to better hand hygiene for hospitalized infants. The species of candida also varies by geography, but generally C. albicans is the most common; however, since 2016 the most serious emerging species is C. auris . More than 70% of the fluconazole Candid a glabrata and Candida krusei (Lockhart et al., 2012). Candidiasis Rates, 2009 -2017 Incidence rates per 100,000 person -years, by ag e group, 2009 -2017. Source: CDC. The surveillance data by the CDC reports that up to 25% mortality is seen in hospitalized patients with candidemia. Of course, those w ith candidemia are those who have entered a hospital with chronic diseases, concomitant medical issues, immune deficiency, medical devices, and thus are at greater risk for fungal infections after multiple uses of antibiotics \u2014 so the true cause of death is multifactorial. ATrain Education 707 459- 1315 Page 12 of 31 Environments and People at Risk When the human body is healthy and body systems work well together, the immune system is able to keep fungus and bacteria in balance and use them as normal flora to help with digestion of food. When a body is out of balance and in a disease or illness state, the immune system has a difficu lt time taming the normal pathogens that share the human environment. Bacteria or fungi may increase, resulting in infection. Populations at risk for a normal flora imbalance include women during pregnancy and people with chronic diseases such as diabete s mellitus, HIV/AIDS, and cancer, as well as people taking antirejection medications for organ and tissue transplants, those immunocompromised, and any pe rson with an autoimmune disease ( Kwamin et al., 2013). There is also a correlation between GI tracts t hat are high in yeast and the development of Crohn's disease (Gerard, et al., 2013). Another example of populations at risk include infants. Oral thrush occurs in up to 6% of babies less than 1 month old and occurs in up to 20% of people who are having chemotherapy or those who have HIV/AIDS. Approximately 75% of women will have at least one yeast infection during their lifetime, and very often after receiving an oral antibiotic for a bacterial infection (CDC, 2019a). When a person uses a glucocorticoid inhaler, which increases blood sugar levels in the mouth, that mouth becomes an ideal location for yeast, resulting in oral thrush . Young babies that consume milk without rinsing of the mouth or bottles that drip during sleep, also increase the risk for oral thrush and dental caries where both yeast and bacteria thrive (Sardi et al., 2013). The use of antibiotics also increases the risk of developing a candida infection as the antibiotics kill off the normal flora of bacteria and allow the yeast to grow unopposed. This is common for women who use antibiotics for a bacterial infection somewhere else in the body and later develop a vaginal yeast infection. Antibiotics disrupt the normal vaginal flora of lactic acid bacteria, such as lactobacilli, and candida can become overgrown. Patients who receive any antibiotic treatment should be taught to consume lactobacillus or acidophilus found in yogurt, or take an over -the-counter probiotic tablet, to replace the normal bacterial flora and combat the potential ove rgrowth of yeast. The Emerging Super Bug of Candida auris Candida auris is a type of candida and was first identified in the ear discharge of a hospitalized patient in Japan in 2009 (STAT, 2016). It is responsible for serious hospital - acquired illnesses and has a mortality rate as high as 60%. Hospital acquired infections (HAIs ) are unfortunately commonly caused by yeast overgrowth, and those with mechanical devices are at an additional risk because the medical devices offer an additional site for yeas t to attach to and grow out of control; it Candidemia is when the yeast enters and flourishes in the bloodstream of a human host represents the fourth leading cause of bloodstream infection in hospitalized patients in the United States (CDC, 2019c). Symptoms of candidemia are generalized and nonspecific. Usually fever that does not improve after antibiotic treatment is a clue to the etiology's being yeast. If the yeast moves into other body organs \u2014the kidneys, brain, eyes, or esophagus \u2014symptoms become specific to that body system. ATrain Education 707 459- 1315 Page 13 of 31 Candida auris has become the yeast of most concern now as it has become a resistant fungal infection, especially in hospitals. Species of the general genus candida have been considered as normal flora and have co- existed since bi rth such as oral thrush and diaper rash. Alarmingly, Candida auris is resistan t to our usual antifungals (e .g., fluconazole). Those at greatest risk are hospitalized patients with a puncture of some sort: an IV line or a mechanical device such as an arterial line or endotracheal tube. Ninety percent of Candida auris pathogens are resistant to at least one antifungal and 30% are resistant to two or more antifungals commonly used to kill these pathogens in the past, making the once -easy-to-treat fungus dead ly. Over 587 patients in California, and more than 300 in New York, have been affected by the deadly yeast ( Today Show , April 2019). Candida auris doesn't seem to appear in healthy people in the community, but rather those immunocompromised in hospital set tings and nursing homes. The medical concern is the fear of the organism makin g that jump from patients at risk to the general community. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has indicated that the incidence of Candida auris is now worldwi de, with reported numerous cases in the United States, India, and Africa (CDC, 2019b). Since 2016 it is reported that 613 people nationwide have died due to inability to treat an infection with Candida auris (ABC New York New s, 2019). Hospitals and facilities often do not want to announce the incidence of cases within their own pr emises to avoid public hysteria or thwart new patients being admitted. Over half of the reported cases revealed 319 of the deaths have occurred in New York hospitals, where the outbreak appears to continue; of those, 157 patients of have died, representing a very high 57% mortality rate.

Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Management of Candida Clinical Symptoms The clinical symptoms vary depending on the location affected by the yeast . From head to toe, the most common sites for fungal infections include the scalp, skin, mouth, gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract, vagina, and nail beds of the hands and feet. The most dangerous type of fungal infection is an invasive infection (or systemic infection ) that enters the bloodstream; it is called candidemia. Funga l infections that originate in the oral cav ity and extend into the esophagus have a higher potential to become an invasive infection because they become systemic. Classically, yeast infections look red, warm, sometimes scaly, and continue to spread if no t treated. They can be itchy but not genera lly painful unless directly on the skin of the genitals and buttocks. They generally do not cause a fever but if not treated can cause a sense of malaise and gastrointestinal upset and bloating if in the GI tract. To review the specific symptoms, let's loo k at each of them based on locations of the body. Skin Infections Topical skin infections include the scalp, head, face, back, chest, axilla, under the breast or in other skin folds, and anywhere on the body from head to toe. When a yeast infection devel ops on the skin it generally appears red, scaly and inflamed with symptoms of itching and burning, however unique configurations can occur that help diagnose the yeast. An example is the classic shape of a ringworm infection on the skin, called Tinea corpo ris. Ringworm is misnamed because there is no actual worm on the skin, rather the unique shape caused by the dermatophyte yeast. Superficial skin infections by yeast at the epidermis are caused by fungi called dermatophytes . The following are images of various types of skin yeast infections.

Internal Infections Because yeast is common as topical normal flora, skin infecti ons can easily develop given the right environment. Additionally, the moist and warm internal environment of the body offers ideal growth for candida. From head to toe, internal candida infections commonly occur in the mouth, known as oral thrush. It app ears as a white sticky coating and can even appear hairy from the extensions of hyphae. It can be easily treated with an oral ant ifungal, such as a swish and swallow medication. Good oral hygiene for patients on ventilators and rinsing after taking an inh aled glucocorticoid can help prevent this. Gastrointestinal yeast infections often present as GI bloating, nausea, vomiting, dia rrhea and generalized malaise. In diets high in sugar, the GI yeast can easily grow and contribute to belly fat, constipation, poor metabolism of food, and further infection ( Garc\u00eda -Elorriaga & Rey-Pineda, 2013) . A common internal yeast infection occurs in the vagina. Symptoms include vaginal itching, foul fishy odor, and white cottage -cheese -like discharge. Upon visualization using a speculum, it is easy to diagnose because of its white discharge. It can be cultured for definitive diagnosis however, most clinicians will easily recognize it and treat it with antifungals intravaginally, or orally. Skin yeast infections can also appear as a red, flat rash with scalloped edges. Satellite lesions are extensions of the original yeast that grow to extend the rash. As noted above, tinea infections are identified by their location on the body.

A skin scraping or swab sampling can be placed under a microscope, which reveals the typical and classic hyphae or fern -like growths. A single drop of potassium hydroxide, KOH , is often added to the microscopic slide, which dissolves the human skin cell wall and exposes the yeast and identifiable hyphae.

Yeast and bacteria l colonies easily occur within 3 to 5 days. Because candida is part of the normal flora, identifying a true infection is based on the various candida species that may grow in an agar culture, the agar fermentation, and assimilation tests. Agar Plate Cult ure of C. Albicans Source: CDC Public Health Image Library. Public domain. Clinicians can often recognize a yeast infection based on its location and classic morphology and do not order diagnostic tests but treat right away. For example, when a practition er sees the classic ring worm formation a topical antifungal is ordered. Occasionally a clinician may observe the skin directly with an ultraviolet light known as a Wood's lamp. The spores of the yeast become fluorescent with a Wood's lamp and appear blue -green when exposed to ultraviolet light. For invasive agents within the bloodstream, non -culture candida detection tests can be done with antigen testing such as the Beta -D-Glucan, or candida PCR, which also be used based on the laboratory's preference and equipment. Immunological tests suc h as skin tests can also be performed. Treatment of Yeast Prompt treatment is key to quick destruction of out of con trol yeast. Pharmacol ogical treatment of candida depends on the location. The severity of the fungal infection also dictates the type of antifungal to be used for treatment. An acute fungal infection on the skin can often easily be treated with topical an tifungals, however if they have become extensive or chronic, often long -term topical agents in addition to oral agents need to be prescri bed. ATrain Education 707 459- 1315 Page 19 of 31 For most acute fungal skin infections, topical antifungals antifungals are generally via a cream that is applied twice daily for 2 to 4 weeks . The length of application depends of course on the severity of the yeast and if the infection is acute or chronic. A topical ringworm infection may require treatment for 14 days, however a topical great -toenail fungal infection may require months of treatment and be very difficult to get rid of as the yeast have become embedded in the matrix of the nail. For chronic ye ast infections, an oral antifung al should be given and and spray. May need 8 -10 weeks for effect. Cannot take during pregnancy or b reastfeeding. May cause birth defects. Men should use condoms for up to six months after treatment to prevent birth defects. Itraconazole (Sporanox) : 1-2 weeks. Not for use in elderly and children with liver disease. Ketoconazole (Nizoral) Terbinafine (L amisil) : once daily x 4 weeks All oral antifungals are processed by the liver's first -pass effect, which may cause nausea, diarrhea, indigestion, headache, dizziness, and even rashes. These oral antifungals are contraindicated for those with liver disease and lupus. ATrain Education 707 459- 1315 Page 20 of 31 For severe funga l infections that impact a mechanical device, prescription IV antibiotics that are used include: Amphotericin Azole antifungals Echinocandins such as micafungin Removal of the mechanic device or tube should also be a prior ity to avoid entry of the patho gen into the bloodstream. Alternative medicines and folk medicine have been used to treat yeast infections. Although not endorsed by the American Medical Association, patients may be using these remedies and healthcare prof essionals should be aware of th em. Many studies exist demonstrating the effectiveness of various essential oils (e.g., oregano oil) and even food substances (Alves -Silva, 2013). Studies have even shown effectiveness of apple cider vinegar against topical a nd intestinal yeasts. 4. Preven tion Strategies for Yeast Infections Naturally, a voiding yeast infections is always the best prevention. Disrupting the ideal growth conditions is the goal. Remembering that yeast grow best in warm, moist, sugar - filled reser voirs helps guide prevention strategies to keep tissues dry and free of excess sugar consumption. For athletes who are prone to athlete's foot or Tinea versicolor of the trunk, frequent washing after sports with adequate drying of the skin is key. For thos e who struggle with intestinal bloating, eliminating or decreasing diets high in sugar can help prevent a belly buffet for the yeast. Prevention strategies include the following ideas for yourself and your patients (Martin, 2012): Protect your nails Don't push cuticles too far back. Take your own instruments to a nail salon or confirm they sterilize instruments between clients. Clean and dry between toes after bathing. Get rid of any shoes/flip flops that you wore if you had athlete's foot. Use topic al antifungal powders if you're prone to foot fungus. ATrain Education 707 459- 1315 Page 21 of 31 Protect your skin Wash workout clothes, T -shirts, swimsuits, etc. after each workout. Wear clothing that may \"wick\" moisture away from skin (e.g., cotton) Bathe daily with a soap cleansing product Bathe or wash hands after playing with animals Protect your gut Eliminate or more realistically, decrease sugar intake Consume natural fruits and vegetables that contain inherent natural pathogens that balance the gut flora Consume a daily probiotic Protect your mouth Perform daily oral hygiene and brushing of teeth and tongue Rinse your mouth or brush your teeth after consuming sugary foods Don't allow baby bottles to be propped up for feeding Rinse a baby's mouth after feedings Hospital Protocols Because Candida auris is generally an issue in hospital and medical facilities and not the general community, hospital cleaning protocols have been established to prevent the spread of candida (Martins, 2014). Candida auris is difficult to detect, especial ly within the blood or internal organs, and hospital settings have increased their environmental cleaning to use antifungal cleansers and UV lights to detect the yeast on hospital furniture and surfaces. Prompt and frequent hand washing remains the best deterrent for transmitting yeast. Improving patient room cleaning between patients has been a focus of recommendations by the CDC for prevention. Manufacturers are improving anti -yeast cleaning agents, though they are still being developed. ATrain Education 707 459- 1315 Page 22 of 31 Complementary and Alternative Therapies In addition to the FDA -approved pharmacologic approaches to treating a yeast infection, there are many folk medicine strategies. Although not endorsed by the FDA, nor are they considered standard practice guidelines, many people are using alternative methods and it's important that heathcare workers and providers are aware of what is being used so they can better educate patients on their efficacy or contraindications for use. Such folk medicine practices include: Bone broth clean ses Eliminating starchy foods such as rice, potatoes, wheat, syrups, and sugar Consuming 1 to 4 tablespoons of coconut oil daily Eating fermented vegetables like bitter greens, kimchi, kefir, kale, or sour kraut that offer organic acid, which lowers col onic pH (e .g., apple cider vinegar, thyme, and oregano, which are turpins that kill yeast). Using specific essential oils can be very beneficial; orally consuming 2 to 3 drops of oregano essential oil in warm water twice daily for 14 days can be very hel pful against yeast. Topical oregano essential oil is also powerful, but can burn the surrounding skin, so a carrier oil is needed. One Portuguese study showed that common household herbs such as coriander, bush-basil, and celery could be us ed as essential oils because of t heir antimicrobial properties (Alves -Silva, 2013). Oil pulling is a process of sucking essential oils back and forth through your teeth for 10 to 20 minutes and then spit ting them out. Using coconut oil, cloves, garlic, and/or oregano ca n be very effective against oral thrush. Colloidal silver (50- 150 mcg silver maximum daily) or fermented silver are also being used internally with intriguing claims. Taking a daily probiotic for at least 30 days has been shown to be help ful to create a healthy gut. Another home remedy is using simple baking soda and water for vaginal douching (sodium kills yeast), however it may not be adequate to fight an existing infection. Another interesting strategy is using yeast to kill yeast. La rger yeast organ isms such as mushrooms and soil -based organisms including Saccho boulardi, a Chinese mushroom, can fight the single -cell organism of intestinal yeast. Warming foods such as meat, lamb, cinnamon, rosemary, cloves, ginger, turmeric, pao darco (a common Chi nese herb) and black cumin, are strategies in Traditional Chinese Medicine that dry the body against a moist internal environment, which would make it difficult for yeast to grow. Eliminating processed sugar in the diet is a simple method to starve the yea st and thus inhibit their growth. Some nutritionists suggest eliminating grains from the diet, because they break down into simple sugars that feed yeast. One way to tell if the yeast is finally destroyed is looking at the tongue. A pink, moist tongue without a white coating is a healthy tongue and a glimpse into the body. Symptoms that point to yeast overgrowth within the body are post meal bloating, whiten ess on the tongue, fatigue, pale and irregular stool, and gastric pain, acid reflux, and sluggish metabolism. ATrain Education 707 459- 1315 Page 23 of 31 Special Case of Candida auris The above treatments are generally focused on the more common candida; however, the treatment for the more threate ning Candida auris is challenging and serious. Currently the incidence of Candida auris is limited to hospital and nursing home settings and has not reached the general healthy population. Because yeast is highly contagious, it can be transferred easily and transported from person to person. Currently, there have been no reports of Candida auris moving from hospital personnel to out -of-hospital family members or community persons. The risk is real, however. Touching hands after touching someone with the y east allows for easy transportation of the yeast. Hand washing remains the best practice to break the link between host and transportation to a new host. The alcohol gel sanitizers used in healthcare facilities are effective, and 20 -30 second handwashing w ith soap and water is effective against candida. Apply Your Knowledge What counsel do you give a patient who has developed an oral yeast infection? What counsel do you give to a family member or friend who has developed an oral yeast infection? Does you r advice change? 5. Summary Candida is a type of yeast that is part of the normal flora of the human body. An opportunistic infection, it can grow out of control and cause candidiasis. Candida auris is a new type of yeast seen recently in hospitals that has recently caused serious outbreaks and a high mortality for patients at risk (including children younger than 1 year, and adults older than 65). The Centers of Disease Control and Prevention monitor cases of candidiasis and candidemia and have noted tr ends showing increases in several states as C. auris has become drug resistant \u2014causing national ala rm. Healthcare professionals need to be aware of the causes, risk factors, prevention, and treatment for the most common types of candida, especially albicans and auris. Simple hand- washing and correct use o f personal protective equipment and room cleani ng are all effective methods to prevent the spread of C. auris in our hospitals.
