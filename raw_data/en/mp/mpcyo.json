It is known as the second brain of the human body, which is responsible for releasing chemicals that activate immune cells that safeguard the body against diseases. The gut is constantly eroded by 'ama', or toxins, that accumulate in the body, primarily because of weak digestion. In ayurveda, an imbalanced digestive system is the root cause of all diseases. It is therefore imperative to remove 'ama' from the body, since it clogs the lymphatic system, weakens immunity and disrupts organ function. The symptoms you can experience due to this are physical weakness and discomfort, drained levels of energy, anxiousness, and mental and physical stress. Ayurveda recommends a cleanse known as Panchakarma to clean the gut and strengthen the 'agni' or the digestive fire so that homeostasis in the body is restored. Ayurveda recommends a gut cleanse at least three times a year, preferably at the start of each season. This helps rid the body of toxins that might have accumulated during the previous season from undigested food, stress and other diseases. While an only-hot-water fast lasting for two to three days might work like magic, many do not attempt it as they find it extremely challenging. This detox is dosha specific and it is advisable to consult an ayurvedic practitioner to list out a gut cleanse to suit your body type specifically. A lifestyle change is highly recommended to achieve a disease-free and balanced body, as it is a long-term solution. Ayurvedic cleanses can last from a minimum of three days to upto a month, depending on the issue as well as your dosha. Panchakarma techniques such as Virechan, Vaman, Basti, Rakta Moksha and Nasya are administered to rejuvenate the body and strengthen the gut. Traditional herbs, pastes, powders, oils and fumes are incorporated into the body through various techniques to clean the gut and remove impurities. However, here are some ways you can practise an ayurvedic gut cleanse every day, to keep the body and the gut healthy and strong. - Right after you wake up, sit upright on your bed and focus on your breath. Take three deep breaths to centre yourself. - Drink a glass of water preferably from a copper vessel to activate the digestive organs and prepare your bowels for evacuation. - Try a few twisting [yoga](https://www.femina.in/wellness/yoga/)poses to activate the body and help the digestive system to release its waste effortlessly. - Brush your teeth with a gentle toothpaste or an ayurvedic dant-manjan (powder). Remember to scrape your tongue with a tongue scraper as this cleanses the esophagus and removes toxins from your digestive tract. - Gargle with warm water and salt without fail. - Wash your face with a mild cleanser and remember to splash some warm water into your eyes to get rid of dirt and mucus. - Drink a glass of hot water with lemon to stimulate the liver to release bile, clear stagnation and cleanse the body. - Practise abhyanga (massage) every day to enhance blood circulation and energise the joints and muscles. - Bathe with cold water. If that is not possible, try bathing with lukewarm water; avoid hot water. - Start eating mindfully. Become aware of what and how much you eat. Fast at least once a week, and avoid eating out. - Learn to drink hot water, and avoid cold water completely. - Eat balanced meals; start including organically-grown whole grains, pulses and flours in your diet. Cold-pressed oils are also a great shift to make in your diet to reduce the risk of cholesterol-related issues.
