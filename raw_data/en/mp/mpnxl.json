The planet came to a standstill as countries started closing its borders and closing down economies in a desperate attempt to control the rate of infection. The world has dealt with coronaviruses before; from the SARS-CoV-1 (commonly referred to as SARS) outbreak of 2002-2004 to the MERS-CoV (referred to as MERS) outbreak that rattled both Saudi Arabia and South Korea in 2015 and yet humanity finds itself at the mercy of another deadly virus yet again, this time at a scale that's unprecedented. With nations now scrambling to \"flatten the curve\" and asking their citizen's to stay indoors to limit the spread of COVID19, one has to come to the realization that pandemics like these won't fade away into an obscure concept and stay as a footnote in our history forever. Viruses are much harder to develop medicines against because of their unique and parasitical nature. \"We are with antivirals now where antibiotics were in the 1950s\", says Dr. Gerald Evans, the chairperson of the infectious diseases division of Queen's University medical school. With possible vaccines for viral illnesses taking months or even years to develop, one has to turn to their body's own natural armour, the immune system. Immunity is our body's biological defence system that fights against infections, diseases and other foreign bodies. It is a state of resistance against any kind of pathogen that invades the body of a potential host. This natural defence system, which prevents the development of diseases or resists a disease, is called Vyadhikshamatva (Immunity) in Ayurveda. If the body is filled with Ama (toxins that accumulate in the body when foods do not completely digest) and lacking in Ojas (it is the essence part of all the body tissues), the infection will find it to be fertile ground for spreading. If digestion is strong and Ojas dominates the body rather than Ama, the infection will not be able to spread and take hold of one's body. This strength is attainable from three sources- Sahaja Bala (Constitutional strength), Kalaja Bala (Temporal strength), and Yuktikrita Bala (Acquired strength). Constitutional strength (Sahaja bala) is that gained from the time of the formation of the foetus onwards. Hence it is dependent on the healthiness of sperm and ovum and also on the excellence of time and place. Temporal strength (Kalaja bala) is the one, which is gained from the favourable condition of time, such as youth, and favourable season. Acquired strength (Yukthikrutha bala) is one, which is achieved by the proper combination of diet, exercise, and other regimens which is followed by good digestion or strong digestive fire. Disease can be defended against by natural means through Ayurveda. Ayurveda focuses on three plans for acquiring or enhancing immunity: As the old adage goes, food is medicine and nothing rings truer as diet has been considered the primary form of medicine in Ayurveda ever since its inception. Ahara or diet is considered as one of the key pillars (Upasthambas) of life in Ayurveda. Here is a list of foods/ingredients that can be included in daily food regimen that helps to increase immunity. Garlic - Garlic with its antiseptic, anti-fungal, and nutritive properties has been used as an immune system booster for thousands of years by Ayurveda. It is a powerful natural antioxidant, which protects the body from bacterial and viral infections, without causing any side-effects. Garlic acts as a natural anti-bacterial agent when it's fresh and raw as it contains the compound Allicin that kills the viruses and bacteria. It is a good medicine against coughs, colds and chest infections during the winter. Ginger - It is an ingredient packed with immune-boosting benefits. Ginger helps support the immune system and prevents nausea and soothes an upset tummy. Ayurveda compliments ginger's ability to boost your immune system. Ginger is very much effective in keeping your body warm and helps break down the accumulation of toxins in your organs. Add ginger to a stir-fried dish or boil it to make a cup of ginger tea with some added lemon for a pleasant and a healing hot drink. It clears phlegm in the lungs, alleviating coughs, colds and breathing difficulties Tulsi ( Ocimum sanctum ) - Daily consumption of Tulsi is said to prevent disease, promote general health, wellbeing and longevity and assist in dealing with the stresses of daily life. It protects the body against viral infections. Turmeric - It acts as an anti-oxidant, a great carminative, able to calm an upset digestive system by getting rid of gas and indigestion. It can be taken every day either with honey or with warm milk. Amla (Indian Gooseberry) - It rejuvenates all the tissues in the body and builds Ojas ie; the essence of immunity and youthfulness. It promotes detoxification with its rich anti-oxidant content. Buttermilk - It guards your immune system. The Riboflavin found in buttermilk helps the function of your liver and detoxing the body. The bacterium in buttermilk helps the immune system by prohibiting entry of various infections and bacteria. Ayurvedic medication to naturally reinforce one's immune system - Internal medicines in Ayurveda are made from herbs and plants that possess medicinal value and healing properties and have been tried, tested and proven over several centuries. The organic nature of such herbs and plants make Ayurvedic medicines non-disruptive and eliminates the chances of side effects. Indukantham kashayam A perfect combination of herbs that boost the defensive system of the body. Enhances immunity on regular intake for a fixed period of time.
