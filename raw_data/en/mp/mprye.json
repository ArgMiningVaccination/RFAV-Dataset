Acupuncture and dry needling are common treatments for pain, and the current literature supports acupuncture as an effective treatment for sciatica. However, it is unknown if the mechanisms of NP are considered in the delivery of needling interventions for sciatica. Our objective was to assess the efficacy and the effectiveness of needling therapies, to identify common needling practices and to investigate if NP mechanisms are considered in the treatment of sciatica. A scoping review of the literature on needling interventions for sciatica and a review of the literature on mechanisms related to NP and needling interventions were performed. Electronic literature searches were conducted on PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from inception to August, 2020 to identify relevant papers. Reference lists of included papers were also manually screened and a related-articles search through PubMed was performed on all included articles. Mapping of the results included description of included studies, summary of results, and identification of gaps in the existing literature. Ten articles were included. All studies used acupuncture for the treatment of sciatica, no studies on dry needling were identified. Current evidence supports the efficacy and effectiveness of acupuncture for sciatica, however, no studies considered underlying NP mechanisms in the acupuncture approach for sciatica and the rationale for using acupuncture was inconsistent among trials. This review reveals that neuropathic pain mechanisms are not routinely considered in needling approaches for patients with sciatica. Studies showed acupuncture to be an effective treatment for sciatic pain, however, further research is warranted to explore if needling interventions for sciatica and NP would be more effective if NP mechanisms are considered.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-05-19", "cleaned_text": "Pain Mechanisms\u2014A Scoping Review [https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10102189](https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10102189) [Needling term 'sciatica' was used to describe pains or 'ischias' felt around the hip or thigh [ [2](#B2-jcm-10-02189)]. Sciatica is closely associated with pain and/or sensory symptoms along a dermatome or the innervated region of an affected spinal root or roots [ [3](#B3-jcm-10-02189), [4](#B4-jcm-10-02189)]. Prevalence estimates for sciatica are heterogeneous, with an annual prevalence between 2.2% and 34% [ [5](#B5-jcm-10-02189)]. A leading cause of sciatica is distortion of a lumbar nerve root due to disc rupture and the literature affirms that the terms sciatica and radiculopathy are often used interchangeably and inconsistently [ [6](#B6-jcm-10-02189)]. According to an epidemiological study, sciatica is highly prevalent in patients with nonlocalized low back pain, i.e., pain occurring at another anatomical site in addition to the low back [ [7](#B7-jcm-10-02189)]. Porchet et al. reported that over 90% of patients with sciatica had MRI confirmed disc bulge, disc protrusion, extrusion or sequestration [ [8](#B8-jcm-10-02189)]. The L4-L5 and L5-S1 discs were pathologic in 36% and 53% of these patients, respectively [ [8](#B8-jcm-10-02189)]. Along with radicular pain, sensory loss [ [9](#B9-jcm-10-02189)], myotome and reflex deficits are common findings on clinical examination in patients with MRI confirmed discogenic sciatica [ [10](#B10-jcm-10-02189)]. According to the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP), painful radiculopathy is an entity of neuropathic pain (NP) as the diagnosis requires pain or sensory symptoms along affected dermatomes or nerve roots [ [11](#B11-jcm-10-02189)]. Importantly, a recent study found that NP was present in 48% to 74% of patients with sciatica seeking treatment in primary care [ [12](#B12-jcm-10-02189)]. [9](#B9-jcm-10-02189)]. In the literature, NP is often studied using chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve in animal models. Interestingly, CCI models imitate the compression-induced nerve injury seen in sciatica and related NP conditions in humans [ [13](#B13-jcm-10-02189)]. Since sciatica can involve nerve root compression and symptoms consistent with NP, a mechanism-based-approach is called for to provide optimal management strategies. However, the features of NP are unique, vary across NP conditions [ [9](#B9-jcm-10-02189)] and can be difficult to manage. Mechanistically, spinal disinhibition resulting from nerve injury leads to decreased control over nociceptive [ [14](#B14-jcm-10-02189)] and non-nociceptive inputs [ [15](#B15-jcm-10-02189)]. CCI induces pathological changes in the dorsal horn that enhance excitatory synaptic transmission while impairing the inhibitory capacity [ [20](#B20-jcm-10-02189)] and dose-dependently gives rise to effects [ [21](#B21-jcm-10-02189), [22](#B22-jcm-10-02189), [23](#B23-jcm-10-02189)]. For patients with sciatica, acupuncture is one of the most effective treatments for pain reduction [ [24](#B24-jcm-10-02189)]. Like acupuncture, dry needling is a unique method of neural stimuli that evokes sensory nerve impulses. These impulses conduct to DHN by way of the needle interaction with nearby nerves [ [25](#B25-jcm-10-02189)] and connective tissues [ [26](#B26-jcm-10-02189)] leading to activation of endogenous pain mechanisms [ [27](#B27-jcm-10-02189)]. Although dry needling and acupuncture differ in theoretical constructs, both interventions use a needle as a mechanical-stimuli to primarily treat pain [ [28](#B28-jcm-10-02189)]. Furthermore, points of needle insertion overlap between the procedures in terms of anatomical relevance and clinical uses for the treatment of pain [ [29](#B29-jcm-10-02189), [30](#B30-jcm-10-02189)]. This review will discuss acupuncture and dry needling together as they relate to the treatment of sciatic pain. Segmental inhibitory mechanisms in the dorsal horn explain the analgesic effects of acupuncture and dry needling [ [29](#B29-jcm-10-02189), [31](#B31-jcm-10-02189), [32](#B32-jcm-10-02189), [33](#B33-jcm-10-02189)]. However, in animal models of nerve injury the ability for A and C-fibers to activate inhibitory interneurons in the dorsal [ from is impaired [ [35](#B35-jcm-10-02189)] and GABA and glycine receptor function is altered [ [36](#B36-jcm-10-02189)]. Therefore, impaired segmental inhibition deserves consideration during the application of needling interventions for patients with sciatica and NP. 2. Methods 2.1. Scoping Review [37](#B37-jcm-10-02189)]. 2.2. Search Strategy [Table 1](#jcm-10-02189-t001)for electronic database search formulas. Consistent with our intent to also review the literature related to mechanisms of needling interventions and NP, electronic literature searches were conducted using the following databases from inception up to August 2020; Google Scholar, PubMed, MEDLINE and CINAHL. The following terms were also merged into the search formulas using reference lists of selected articles were manually screened to identify additional studies. Further, a related-articles search through PubMed was performed on all included articles. 2.3. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria [Table 2](#jcm-10-02189-t002). A second author (BG) was consulted during the process of article inclusion if questions arose as to the relevance of particular studies. No discrepancy occurred between both authors with regards to study selection and there was no need for a third author to be consulted. Studies were eliminated based on the exclusion criteria in [Table 2](#jcm-10-02189-t002). 2.4. Data Mapping 3. Results [Figure 1](#jcm-10-02189-f001)shows the diagram based on PRISMA guidelines. [Table 3](#jcm-10-02189-t003)and [Table 4](#jcm-10-02189-t004). The inclusion criteria for patients with sciatica varied across the studies. Five studies included participants with sciatica symptoms and clinical findings that correlated with MRI or CT confirmation [22](#B22-jcm-10-02189), [38](#B38-jcm-10-02189), [39](#B39-jcm-10-02189), [40](#B40-jcm-10-02189), [41](#B41-jcm-10-02189)]. Three studies included patients with a clinical diagnosis of sciatica based on nerve root pain and referred pain [ [24](#B24-jcm-10-02189), [42](#B42-jcm-10-02189), [43](#B43-jcm-10-02189)]. Lastly, in two systematic review and meta-analysis studies the conformity of inclusion criteria was limited in the included trials. Ji et al. included studies with participants who had either subjective signs of sciatica, positive clinical examination tests or both [ [44](#B44-jcm-10-02189)]. Qin et al. included patients with sciatica of the nerve roots along with lumbar disc herniation or with sciatica of the nerve trunk without lumbar disc herniation [ [45](#B45-jcm-10-02189)]. Liu et al. used the most specific criteria by selecting patients with radicular pain in L4, L5, or S1 dermatome, physical examination consistent with L4, L5, or S1 spinal nerve root involvement and MRI demonstrating a unilateral disc herniation impinging on the L4, L5, or S1 nerve roots [ [22](#B22-jcm-10-02189)]. 3.1. Effects on Pain Intensity [40](#B40-jcm-10-02189)]. Included studies for sciatica all favored acupuncture for pain compared to physical therapy, electrotherapy, and sham acupuncture. Pooled data from 3 trials on sciatica was used for subgroup analysis with 2 trials using a 0-100 mm VAS scale and 1 using an 11-point numerical rating scale. 3.2. Efficacy [41](#B41-jcm-10-02189)]. These results are consistent with the effects of acupuncture compared to sham across several common pain conditions [ [46](#B46-jcm-10-02189)]. [24](#B24-jcm-10-02189)]. However, of the 122 studies included, only a single study on acupuncture was analyzed to determine results on pain intensity and the pain scale used was not reported [ [47](#B47-jcm-10-02189)]. In an earlier systematic review, real acupuncture demonstrated significant improvement in pain intensity compared to sham acupuncture (WMD 25.00, 95%CI 41.19 to 8.81) but the pain scale used in the included trial was not reported [ [42](#B42-jcm-10-02189)]. In contrast, Luijsterburg et al. concluded in the earliest included review that there was insufficient evidence supporting electroacupuncture for pain in patients with lumbar radicular syndrome based on limited data reported in a single study [ [43](#B43-jcm-10-02189)]. 3.3. Effectiveness [44](#B44-jcm-10-02189)]. However, most randomized trials had low methodological quality and high risk of bias. Additionally, treatment regimens with acupuncture were highly variable between trials. According to the meta-analysis by Qin et al., compared to NSAIDs, acupuncture was more effective for decreasing leg pain (MD 1.23, 95%CI 1.87 to 0.60, 2 0%, n = 3 trials using 0-100 mm VAS) [ [45](#B45-jcm-10-02189)]. [38](#B38-jcm-10-02189)]. Importantly, at week 28 follow-up only the EA group showed significantly decreased leg pain compared to the baseline, implying that the effect of EA but not electrotherapy lasted for 28 weeks. Jeong et al. reported that acupuncture led to reductions in pain of 8.13 and 12.28 mm on the VAS at 4 and 6 weeks from baseline, respectively, in 70 patients with radicular symptoms consistent with lumbar disc herniation [ [39](#B39-jcm-10-02189)]. [22](#B22-jcm-10-02189)]. While the number of needles inserted is one of the only dosage parameters attributed to better outcomes in some chronic pain conditions [ [48](#B48-jcm-10-02189)] this has not been demonstrated in patients with sciatica or NP. 3.4. Common Needling Practices for Sciatica [44](#B44-jcm-10-02189), [45](#B45-jcm-10-02189)], two selected points based on expert consensus and a previous study protocol [ [38](#B38-jcm-10-02189), [41](#B41-jcm-10-02189)], and one study used acupuncturist experience in addition to TCM theory [ [22](#B22-jcm-10-02189)]. In four studies the treatment rationale for use of acupuncture was either not explicitly stated [ [39](#B39-jcm-10-02189), [49](#B49-jcm-10-02189)] or could not be determined due to language barriers [ [24](#B24-jcm-10-02189), [42](#B42-jcm-10-02189), [43](#B43-jcm-10-02189)]. Interestingly, one recent trial applied a Western medicine approach by choosing acupuncture points for sciatica that were distributed along the L4, L5 and S1 dermatomes in addition to rationale based on TCM theory [ [22](#B22-jcm-10-02189)]. In addition, one study placed needles bilaterally at the segmental level of lumbar disc herniation in combination with BL25 [ [38](#B38-jcm-10-02189)]. [22](#B22-jcm-10-02189), [39](#B39-jcm-10-02189), [41](#B41-jcm-10-02189)] while one reported manual manipulation followed by electric needle stimulation [ [38](#B38-jcm-10-02189)]. Most reported the elicitation of de qi (needle sensation) and needle manipulations varied across studies between lift-thrust, twirling or a combination of both [ [22](#B22-jcm-10-02189), [39](#B39-jcm-10-02189), [40](#B40-jcm-10-02189)]. Needle retention time ranged from 5-45 min between included studies in the reviews and between 15-30 min in the randomized controlled trials. Frequency, duration and number of needling sessions were inconsistent across trials, and the number of treatments ranged between four to sixteen. Collectively, the included studies demonstrate the following; (1) multiple needles are inserted intentionally or coincidentally along the sciatic nerve distribution and associated dermatomes and/or myotomes, (2) needles are manipulated either manually or electrically, (3) needles are retained for a predetermined duration with or without intermittent manipulation, (4) multiple sessions are provided within a 2-4 week period. At present, no dosage guidelines for acupuncture or dry needling exists for the treatment of sciatica or NP. However, consistent with a recent expert consensus on acupuncture for sciatica [ [50](#B50-jcm-10-02189)], the included studies used common acupuncture points for sciatica along the gall bladder (GB) and bladder (BL) meridians that are depicted in [Figure 2](#jcm-10-02189-f002). 4. Discussion [4](#B4-jcm-10-02189)]. There is clearly some neuroanatomical significance to the meridians and acupuncture points most commonly chosen for sciatica [ [51](#B51-jcm-10-02189)]. Needling beyond and not at the site of compression is common in practice as most points being needled for sciatica are distal or proximal to sites of potential nerve compression. This approach has shown to inhibit nociception in CCI models of neuropathic pain lending support to the common acupuncture practices for sciatica [ [13](#B13-jcm-10-02189)]. For sciatica, placement of needles along the dermatomes, myotomes and spinal segments related to the sciatic nerve seems to be effective [ [52](#B52-jcm-10-02189)]. 4.1. Disinhibition: Considerations for Needling Interventions [21](#B21-jcm-10-02189), [53](#B53-jcm-10-02189)] from DHN [ [54](#B54-jcm-10-02189)] that are evoked during needle manipulation [ [55](#B55-jcm-10-02189), [56](#B56-jcm-10-02189), [57](#B57-jcm-10-02189)]. Studies show opioid peptides are released only in spinal segments that receive innervations from the stimulated area, ipsilateral to the mechanical stimulus [ [27](#B27-jcm-10-02189), [58](#B58-jcm-10-02189)]. Consequently, the needle evoked opioid release produces strong inhibitory effects at the spinal cord level [ [59](#B59-jcm-10-02189), [60](#B60-jcm-10-02189)]. However, the neural drive along injured afferent fibers is reduced limiting the ability for noxious stimulation to activate target receptors in the dorsal horn [ [61](#B61-jcm-10-02189)]. According to Chen et al. [ [61](#B61-jcm-10-02189)], -opioid receptor (MOR) inhibition of neuropeptide release from afferent terminals in the dorsal horn is impaired following CCI. Importantly, downregulation of MOR expression occurs in the spinal segment of injured fibers and in neighboring rostro-caudal segments ipsilateral to the injury [ [62](#B62-jcm-10-02189)]. Thus, inhibition of DHN from noxious stimulation induced release of endogenous opioids is impaired in the dorsal horn following nerve injury [ [63](#B63-jcm-10-02189)]. Given this, clinicians should carefully consider using painful needle stimuli at the segmental level(s) of nerve injury or compression to elicit opioid related effects in patients with sciatica and NP. [64](#B64-jcm-10-02189), [65](#B65-jcm-10-02189)]. However, studies show that disruption of potassium-chloride co transporter 2 (KCC2) in DHN alters the function GABA and glycine [36](#B36-jcm-10-02189), [66](#B66-jcm-10-02189)]. of chloride (CL) channels replicates the sciatic nerve and allodynia [67](#B67-jcm-10-02189)]. However, restoring DHN by application of a KCC2 activator after nerve injury reversed signs of tactile allodynia in an animal model [ [15](#B15-jcm-10-02189)]. Prior evidence suggests that after nerve injury, tactile allodynia results from A fibers sprouting into nociceptive pathways in the superficial lamina [ [68](#B68-jcm-10-02189), [69](#B69-jcm-10-02189), [70](#B70-jcm-10-02189)]. Yet, evidence for nerve injury-induced A fiber sprouting is lacking and suggests other mechanisms [ [71](#B71-jcm-10-02189)]. A novel study demonstrated that glycinergic inhibition of protein kinase c gamma (PKC\u00dd) neurons is impaired at the spinal level of nerve injury leading to tactile allodynia via A fiber activation of PKC\u00dd neurons [ [72](#B72-jcm-10-02189)]. These studies showcase the problem of disinhibition and tactile allodynia that occur in NP. Using needle approaches that specifically target A fiber activation, such as innocuous EA, may fail to produce analgesic effects if the segmental area of pain is directly targeted [ [31](#B31-jcm-10-02189)] 4.2. Needle Manipulation, Mast Cells and Mediators [73](#B73-jcm-10-02189), [74](#B74-jcm-10-02189), [75](#B75-jcm-10-02189), [76](#B76-jcm-10-02189)] and that the via connective tissue winding [ [77](#B77-jcm-10-02189), [78](#B78-jcm-10-02189)]. In contrast, Chang et al. found that needle manipulation still induced antinociceptive effects despite destruction of local collagen fibers [ [25](#B25-jcm-10-02189)]. Chen et al. demonstrated that some afferent fibers are responsive to local needling by mechanical activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) receptors evoking excitatory responses that propagate to the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), DHN and to the somatosensory cortex [ [79](#B79-jcm-10-02189)]. Thus, needle stimuli may directly activate primary afferents by distortion of nerve terminals near the needle and not just through connective tissue mechanisms [ [80](#B80-jcm-10-02189)]. A recent study reported that mast cell (MC) degranulation was essential to evoke nerve discharges in the lumbar dorsal roots during needle manipulation. That is, MC degranulation results in release of MC mediators, such as ATP and histamine, that trigger nerve discharges [ [26](#B26-jcm-10-02189)]. In mechanistic studies, MC are reported to be essential to the therapeutic effects of needling [ [74](#B74-jcm-10-02189), [81](#B81-jcm-10-02189), [82](#B82-jcm-10-02189)]. The presence of mechanosensitive channels on MC allow a variety of stimuli to trigger degranulation [ [83](#B83-jcm-10-02189), [84](#B84-jcm-10-02189), [85](#B85-jcm-10-02189)]. MC activation can be triggered by elevated interstitial fluid pressure and fluid shear stress nearby an inserted needle [ [86](#B86-jcm-10-02189), [87](#B87-jcm-10-02189)]. Dimitrov et al. reported in rats that MC degranulation occurred along the needle tract following insertion without manipulation [ [88](#B88-jcm-10-02189)]. Importantly, manipulation applied to needles after insertion will alter tissue stiffness and sustain MC recruitment and degranulation near the needled area [ [89](#B89-jcm-10-02189)]. Earlier studies on animal [ [17](#B17-jcm-10-02189)] and human models [ [90](#B90-jcm-10-02189)] found that needling increases local ATP and adenosine concentrations. More recent studies support that MCs, fibroblasts and afferent fibers are the primary sources of needle induced ATP release [ [85](#B85-jcm-10-02189), [91](#B91-jcm-10-02189), [92](#B92-jcm-10-02189), [93](#B93-jcm-10-02189)]. Interestingly, when MCs are exposed to extracellular ATP it will bind to P2Y13 and P2x7 receptors on the same or nearby MCs to further liberate intracellular ATP stores [ [94](#B94-jcm-10-02189)]. This creates a renewable purinergic signal along connective tissues and afferent pathways. In theory, needle retention interrupted by bouts of manipulation may sustain MC degranulation and subsequent release of [17](#B17-jcm-10-02189), located on primary afferent terminals, but most are confined to interneurons in lamina [ [97](#B97-jcm-10-02189)] and when activated by adenosine will hyperpolarize interneurons receiving A and C-fiber input [ [98](#B98-jcm-10-02189), [99](#B99-jcm-10-02189)]. Due to their position, A1Rs have been shown to modulate A fiber activity and reduce tactile allodynia under conditions of NP [ [20](#B20-jcm-10-02189)]. Adenosine also acts on A1Rs of afferent terminals to inhibit substance P (SP), calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) and excitatory neurotransmitter release [ [100](#B100-jcm-10-02189)] making it useful for NP by counteracting increased neuropeptide expression that occurs following nerve injury [ [13](#B13-jcm-10-02189)]. Evidenced demonstrates that ectonucleotidases reside within the epineurium of peripheral nerves, the membrane of DRG neurons and their axon terminals in lamina [95](#B95-jcm-10-02189), [96](#B96-jcm-10-02189), [101](#B101-jcm-10-02189)]. Following nerve injury, the expression of these enzymes is downregulated [ [102](#B102-jcm-10-02189)] in the laminar region containing axon terminals from the injured afferents [ [95](#B95-jcm-10-02189)]. Consequently, this impairs adenosine analgesia in the injured spinal segment. Theoretically, producing a build-up of adenosine via needling along non-injured rostro-caudal segments could overwhelm adenosine transporters and enzymes [ [96](#B96-jcm-10-02189)] while also aiding adenosine analgesia at injured segments. 4.4. Intersegmental Approach [103](#B103-jcm-10-02189)]. However, individual primary afferents also ramify at the dorsal roots spreading several segments along a rostro caudal axis, after root branching, prior to entering specific lamina at the dorsal horn. A recent study reported afferent fiber arborization can occur up to six spinal segments apart before they integrate into the superficial dorsal horn [ [104](#B104-jcm-10-02189)]. Within the superficial lamina individual nerve fibers contain many synaptic boutons and give off ascending collateral branches that synapse with interneurons of neighboring segments along with afferent terminals from the segment of origin [ [105](#B105-jcm-10-02189), [106](#B106-jcm-10-02189)]. Thus, the circuitry within the dorsal horn functions inter-segmentally. In fact, interneurons in lamina receive monosynaptic A and C fiber inputs from arborizations of up to four different dorsal roots [ [107](#B107-jcm-10-02189)] and neurons in lamina receive monosynaptic innervations from up to six dorsal roots [ [108](#B108-jcm-10-02189)]. That is, many afferent fibers arrive at the dorsal horn at an entirely different segment before terminating at a given level. Pinto et al. found that the strongest A and C fiber inputs to neurons in lamina were from arborizations coming from the root of the caudal segment, followed by the root projecting to the spinal segment containing that neuron [ [108](#B108-jcm-10-02189)]. Fernandes et al. reported that C fiber inhibition is strongest at a given segment when afferents of a caudal segment that project to it are activated via noxious stimulation [ [109](#B109-jcm-10-02189)]. Interestingly, needling along an area with sensory projection spanning within the rostro-caudal extent of 2-3 spinal segments of an injured spinal nerve has proved to relieve mechanical hypersensitivity in animal models of NP [ [18](#B18-jcm-10-02189)]. [110](#B110-jcm-10-02189)] and binding onto GABAB receptors [ [111](#B111-jcm-10-02189), [112](#B112-jcm-10-02189)]. GABAB receptors on A and C fiber terminals have proven to attenuate nociceptive transmission into the dorsal horn by suppressing glutamate and SP release and through hyperpolarization of DHN [ [113](#B113-jcm-10-02189), [114](#B114-jcm-10-02189)]. Importantly, GABAB receptors are not susceptible to the CL dysregulation that occurs following nerve injury. A recent study demonstrated that electroacupuncture applied within a particular lumbosacral dermatome, synchronously activates DHN that are interconnected in a rostro-caudal manner across multiple spinal segments [ [115](#B115-jcm-10-02189)]. Evidence suggests that presynaptic inhibition is enhanced by increasing the synchronization between pairs of evoked DHN, allowing better modulation of arriving afferent inputs [ [116](#B116-jcm-10-02189)]. Thus, in the delivery of needling for sciatica and the mechanistic complications related to NP, an intersegmental approach is suggested ( [Figure 3](#jcm-10-02189-f003)). 4.5. Noradrenergic Modulation of NP [117](#B117-jcm-10-02189)]. Needle stimuli at A threshold in the hindlimb of rats activates descending NA containing neurons from the locus coeruleus (LC), enhancing NA levels in the dorsal horn [ [118](#B118-jcm-10-02189)]. At the spinal level, NA inhibits nociceptive input from primary afferents and facilitates descending inhibition by activating 1 and 2 adrenoceptors, respectively [ [119](#B119-jcm-10-02189), [120](#B120-jcm-10-02189)]. NA reduces noxious inputs arriving at the dorsal horn by activating inhibitory or hyperpolarizing excitatory- interneurons and afferents [ [121](#B121-jcm-10-02189), [122](#B122-jcm-10-02189)]. In patients with sciatica, pain reduction EA correlated with increased arginine vasopressin levels (AVP) [ [123](#B123-jcm-10-02189)] as AVP triggers descending pain inhibition following increased NA levels in the hypothalamus [ [124](#B124-jcm-10-02189), [125](#B125-jcm-10-02189)]. Importantly, NA containing fibers from the LC of the hypothalamus project down to the dorsal horn to provide the primary supply of NA in the spinal cord [ [120](#B120-jcm-10-02189)]. NA may exert its presynaptic and postsynaptic effects by volume transmission in the dorsal horn, diffusing from its source and spreading to sites of action on afferent terminals and interneurons [ [126](#B126-jcm-10-02189)]. Theoretically, a hypothesis could be that needle stimulation to activate afferents along several rostro-caudal segments may potentiate analgesic effects as a result of NA volume transmission. 4.6. Restorative Effects of Needling for Neuropathic Pain [127](#B127-jcm-10-02189), [128](#B128-jcm-10-02189)]. At injured spinal levels, secrete brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) [ binds to the tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB) and when activated this pathway reduces KCC2 expression in DHN [ [130](#B130-jcm-10-02189)]. Consequently, the loss of KCC2 receptors limits CL- extrusion in DHN altering of GABA and glycine [ [131](#B131-jcm-10-02189), [132](#B132-jcm-10-02189)]. Acute and prolonged release of BDNF initiates and sustains the CL- dysregulation that causes the symptoms characteristic of neuropathic pain [ [129](#B129-jcm-10-02189)]. Several studies support that following nerve injury, EA inhibits the expression of both microglia and astrocytes in the dorsal horn [ [127](#B127-jcm-10-02189), [128](#B128-jcm-10-02189)]. Tu et al. demonstrated EA reduced microglial activation and diminished BDNF and TrkB expression in the L4-L6 segments of the superficial dorsal horn in animal models of sciatic nerve injury [ [133](#B133-jcm-10-02189)]. In another study, EA down-regulated the BDNF and TrkB pathway following nerve injury while reducing the hyperexcitability of DHN [ [134](#B134-jcm-10-02189)]. Perhaps the most restorative effect of EA, is it substantially increased KCC2 expression of the lumbar dorsal horn, within the segments that received injured afferent fiber input [ [135](#B135-jcm-10-02189)]. Mechanistically, electric [ [136](#B136-jcm-10-02189)] and manual forms of needle stimuli [ [76](#B76-jcm-10-02189)] elicit distinct neurophysiological effects [ [137](#B137-jcm-10-02189)]. Yet, at the spinal nerve level both high and low frequency firing patterns, similar to those produced by EA, are also evoked by manual stimuli [ [80](#B80-jcm-10-02189)]. Previous studies have proved manual acupuncture to also inhibit microglia and astrocyte activation following spinal cord injury [ [138](#B138-jcm-10-02189), [139](#B139-jcm-10-02189), [140](#B140-jcm-10-02189)]. Taken together, studies support needling interventions to have therapeutic effects on patients with sciatica through their ability to inhibit spinal glial cells while restoring chloride regulation in DHN following sciatic nerve injury. 4.7.
