Toni Lui, MSW RSW, is one of our wonderful clinicians who provides support to families navigating the system and reflecting on the impact of their child receiving a new diagnosis related to autism or disability issue. We asked her to shed light on some of these misunderstandings to help educate us further! 1. Autism is an illness or disease ASD is not an illness that needs a cure. ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by challenges with communication, social interaction, and in some individuals restricted and repetitive patterns of behaviour and thought. Autism falls along a spectrum where no two individuals with ASD are alike as each person presents with different characteristics of ASD. In fact, many people with ASD do not support finding a \"cure\" because this might change the unique characteristics that make them who they are. 2. Individuals with Autism are either savants (e.g. have a photographic memory), nonverbal, or have an intellectual disability Most individuals with ASD do not have savant skills and every person has varying levels of abilities. Some individuals may be nonverbal but have exceptionally high IQ, while some individuals may be verbal but have difficulty processing information. All individuals with ASD are capable of learning when given the right supports tailored to their abilities and needs. 3. Individuals with Autism are antisocial While some individuals with ASD may prefer quiet time and sometimes being alone, many people with autism want to make friends and socialize with others. Given their challenges in social interaction and communication, this makes it difficult for them to initiate and sustain friendships when they have not developed the social skills needed. This difficulty can lead individuals with autism to feel anxiety and rejection from others when attempts at social interaction are unsuccessful. It is up to the people around them to understand, accept, include, and support people with autism to engage in meaningful social interactions. 4. Individuals with Autism do not have feelings or empathy Individuals with autism experience just as many feelings as the average person and they are capable of empathy. However, this may not show, because they may express or experience feelings in different or less obvious ways. Individuals with ASD may have some trouble identifying how they are feeling and this may come across through behaviours instead of words. Social communication challenges may make it more difficult for those on the spectrum to interpret others' emotions, however this does not mean that they lack empathy towards others. It might just mean that they haven't been able to figure out how someone else is feeling yet. 5. Vaccines cause Autism This myth started when a study in 1998 was published in the Lancet that linked the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine to autism. This caused a lot of media attention and fear among the general public. However, the study has since been discredited due to fraudulent data. The physician involved was held accountable by having his medical licence removed. Further studies have not found links to vaccines causing autism. "}
