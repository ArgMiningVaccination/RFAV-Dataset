CDC Says Flu Vaccination Is Ineffective Do flu shots work? The science says no. Since the approval of the first influenza vaccine for mass administration, doctors had known the flu shots are not as effective as they claim. But yet the United States Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) continues to recommend flu shots for people at the onset of the influenza season. Over the years, many people have complained about falling ill with body aches, fever, headache, and cough after being administered the flu shot. But doctors are quick to dismiss their issue as a mere coincidence since correlation and causation are not the same things. However, the CDC now admits that the effectiveness of flu shots in preventing influenza is low. What's more, scientists now know that people with a history of seasonal influenza shots are at a higher risk of catching the flu. Researchers in Europe and Canada had already published studies on the effects of flu shots on immunity. In 2010, Canadian researchers found that getting the flu shot the previous season doubled the risk of getting the flu the following year. Scientists in Europe have also published several other studies confirming that vaccinations provide a different immune response compared to natural flu infections, and thus reducing the efficacy of the shots. All the while, the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/qa/vaccineeffect.htm) claimed influenza shots could offer up to 70-90 percent protection against flu infections. It turns out that the CDC and other stakeholders in the health industry had been using incorrect data to estimate the number of people hospitalized due to flu infections. In 2015, US public health officials studying the rate of flu infections during the 2012-2013 season in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Washington, and Wisconsin states found that influenza vaccine had between 39 percent to 66 percent effectiveness, according to the flu strain. The officials also discovered that flu shots had almost zero effectiveness in individuals above the age of 65. Older children who have a history of annual influenza shots also showed abysmal levels of immunity to the infection. The interesting part was that the health officials found that people who did not receive flu shots had a higher chance of enjoying good health compared to vaccinated individuals. A decade-long CDC study which investigated vaccine effectiveness between 2005 to 2015 shows that the effectiveness of flu shots provides [less than 50 percent effectiveness](https://www.nvic.org/nvic-vaccine-news/april-2016/cdc-admits-flu-shots-fail-half-the-time.aspx) over half of the time. But why do public health doctors keep telling people to get flu shots every year despite knowing of their ineffectiveness? It is absurd that public health officials tell Americans to get flu shots from their first year to the last year while these shots could do more damage than good to the immune system. Doctors are aware that reactions to flu vaccines can cause [Guillain Barre Syndrome](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Guillain-Barre-Syndrome-Fact-Sheet), an inflammation of the nerves as well as other health conditions. It has also become known that public health officials do not have much understanding of the influenza virus and how to measure immunity. Even the tests currently used to diagnose influenza's are not accurate. Several critical elements are missing in the influenza vaccine program, but these have not stopped health officials from encouraging, and sometimes coercing people to get flu shots. As we enter the flu season, consider your options before making any rash decision. Your body has a potent immune system that can adapt quickly to fight off most influenza strains. Should you and your family take the flu shot? The science says no. A better choice is to make sure your immune system is functioning at its optimal. During this time of year I add an increased amount of vitamin D and zinc to my diet to help boost my immune system. Additional supplements can include Echinacea, probiotics, elderberry syrup, and many essential oils such as Thieves, Peppermint, and Immupower. Plus, every time you receive a chiropractic adjustment you immune system gets stimulated through the nervous system. So if you want to protect yourself and your family from the flu this season instead of getting a shot that may cause more harm than good add some supplements and don't forget to come in for your maintenance adjustments.
