As for people who vaccinate their children being worried about their children attending school with a child who has not been vaccinated, I pose this query: If the vaccines work, what are you worried about? Vaccines are not 100% effective, and can fail, especially in those with compromised immune systems. Those with compromised immune systems are also those more likely to have serious complications from the illnesses themselves. That is why it's important to have the *population* vaccinated, not just individuals. There are now recorded upticks in dangerous illnesses in areas where larger numbers of people choose not to vaccinate, so it's not theoretical anymore; these diseases DO become greater threat when large numbers of people choose to forgo vaccinations. In regards to the OP, Pediatricians are notoriously hard to get into here, and most I know will not treat non-vaxers for the sake of the health of the patients and pregnant women in the waiting room who are health-vulnerable or infants not yet vaccinated due to age. There are several urgent care centers that will see to your child's care if there is a concern, and you may have better luck with a family doc. But seriously, consider where most of this anti-vax information comes from.. shady clickbait websites trying to make a quick buck pandering to hysterics by drawing people to a page with hyperbolic information and lots of crappy ads for snake oil and health fad items. This really baffles me.. the huge VAST majority of practicing physicians endorse vaccines. I know some people read some blogs with names like 'farmacy-dot-com' and got scared, but really are doctors - people who went through the rigors of medical school - universally all so stupid and cowed that they are *virtually all* processing that same information incorrectly?

I am a mother to a 5 year old and pregnant with my next child. I would like to find a doctor that will support my decision to delay vaccines for my baby. My 5 year old is medically exempt and very healthy. She had a great Dr. but she moved to FL. We went to Madison Family Care which is a more progressive and natural practice but just found out it is now under new management. Any natural moms that have a good family doctor recommendation? I'm also looking for a great chiropractor that will work with children and my tight budget. Thanks! It concerns me that you say your daughter is \"medically exempt\". Does that mean she has had no vaccines at all? If so, then she is at risk to catch a vaccine preventable illness and bring it home to your baby while you delay the baby's vaccines. Even if you breast feed, you cannot count on 100% protection for your baby. In particular, I would worry about whooping cough, which has been reported in your area over the last year. Have you and any adults who will be around your baby had the Tdap vaccine? Many infants who get whooping cough catch it from their mothers, so a Tdap booster is recommended during every pregnancy. Have you had yours? How about a flu vaccine for yourself and other adults in your family - for your protection (flu in pregnancy can be lethal) and for that of your unvaccinated daughter? I know you say that you have already decided to delay vaccines for your baby. I think it is reasonable of us to ask why, when the recommended schedule has sound science behind it and valid medical reasons to depart from it are non-existent? Also, why would you take a child to a chiropractor at all? Quote: Originally Posted by Mr. Mom Au contraire. In Alabama, the County Health Dept. can issue a Religious exemption. All you have to do is state it is against your religious beliefs and they will gladly give you one. Doctors can also provide a medical exemption, but one would have to convince the individual doctor of this or the child would have had to have a documented adverse reaction to a prior vaccine. The religious exemptions are much easier to obtain. For those of you who fear your child coming in contact with an unvaccinated child at school, you might be surprised to know how many children have religious exemptions and as a result have not been vaccinated. In other words lie about your religious beliefs? That's just dandy advice. Those of us who are concerned about dropping vaccination rates are quite aware that there are more and more unvaccinated children in our schools. It's scary. There's no reason for a child in this country to have measles or whooping cough, but it's happening. Not to mention adults who get whooping cough and are miserable for weeks or months. If all kids in public schools are vaccinated,WHY DOES IT MATTER IF HER BABY ISNT?? (They wont get anything,they have been vaccinated....Vaccines are so good right?) Dude, you know why. You've been told over and over again. It's because there are kids who are too young to be vaccinated or have medical conditions that make it contraindicated for them to be, such as those with immune deficiencies and those on treatment for leukemia or cancer. It appears the OP has such a child. Although news coverage of Enterovirus D-68 has been overcome by constant EBOLA news, it remains a much larger risk to the general population. First identified in 1962, most people had never heard of it until this year when the number of cases spiked tremendously in the US. I don't think it's a coincidence that this huge spike happened to occur after a large surge of children from central America were brought into the country. And I can tell you that it's here in HSV because notifications (both in writing and email) were sent home from my child's preschool because a child there has a confirmed case of it. There is no evidence that enterovirus D68 in the US has anything to do with the recent influx of children from Central America. Chickenpox, yes. Head lice, yes. Enterovirus D68 was already in the US, and there is no epidemiological evidence the current outbreak has to do with immigrant children. Enterovirus D68 usually causes a common cold. Cases are not reported because they are mild and usually do not need any medical care beyond over the counter symptom remedies. Cases are being counted this year because of clusters of more serious cases, especially in kids with asthma. There are more reported cases this year because doctors are being asked to test and report, when they usually do not do that. It concerns me that you say your daughter is \"medically exempt\".

It's because there are kids who are too young to be vaccinated or have medical conditions that make it contraindicated for them to be, such as those with immune deficiencies and those on treatment for leukemia or cancer. It appears the OP has such a child. I worked in the medical field and I have seen what happens to a child who has measles. It is pretty awful. My best friend's nephew had measles last fall. His mom read all the \"information\" on the internet and did her \"research\" and decided not to vaccinate. He developed complications including enchephalitis, which resulted in brain damage. He is now permanantely disabled at the age of 9. I wonder how happy she is with her decision to believe in an internet hack who had and extra $25 laying around so that he could start his own website. That poor boy. Well I am suffering with an auto immune disease which I believe was caused by the garbage in the vaccines I used to have when I was younger....... Now that I am VERY AWARE OF THINGS,I do not want to poision myself anymore!! I think, maybe in 100 more years, people will be able to look back and see what painfully obvious thing we're doing as a society that is causing immunosuppression and hyper-active immune systems. The problem is, there are so many variables it's hard to tell. Take, for instance, that maybe some types of plastics might break down so that they could trigger receptors in the body. Well, if that plastic is system wide, the best way to package pre-packaged snacks. Then more than likely the closer we get to finding the answer the more misled we would be by focusing on the pre-packaged food, which is not healthy to begin with. People who live where corn is grown have more autistic kids. My immediate knee-jerk reaction is to blame pesticides that are endocrine disruptors. But the variables are all over the place. For instance, what are the factors that make this place ideal for growing corn? Could one of those factors, not directly, but through a chain of causality, lead to the real answer? And while I dismiss my suspecting Atrazine as the cause of autism (and we now know that autism is a birth defect) by saying it's a knee jerk reaction, I do believe that we're on the right path for this one. But, alas, Atrazine is too useful to us as a whole for people to want to give it up. The same goes for that pesticide we found out is killing the bees. They absolutely know that's whats doing it, but they still aren't going to pull it, because people believe it is worth the risk. Blaming vaccines for an over-active immune system seems valid. It might be valid. It's hard to tell. As mentioned before, scammers locking into the anti-vaccine demographic and getting rich off feeding them misinformation is hurting any ability to get valid answers. Hopefully, when we do find out what is causing the issues, people will choose to change things. Which reminds me, I really need to worry about heart disease more. Because we know what causes that, and we don't care. OP, feel free to message me and I'll give you the name of our wonderful pediatrician (and you can use me as a reference). He's fine with whatever choice the parent's make (selective, delayed or none). Our son is 15 months old and we have always felt very supported by him and the staff and they have never questioned our choices. It is so sad that people feel that they have a right to tell a parent what medical procedures they should or should not have administered to their child. My child is the responsibility of myself and my husband, no one else. And the whole \"greater good\" argument is ridiculous. I will never risk my child's health and/or life for the \"greater good\" of the masses. The statistics of parents that don't vaccinate are much different than what so many assume, the vast majority are upper middle class, white, and hold a bachelors degree or higher. I know more PhDs/MDs that don't vaccinate than do. Not everyone that chooses not to vaccinate is an aluminum foil hat wearer, most of use are soccer moms, PTA members, and professionals that fly under the radar because we don't feel the need to constantly be vilified and have to defend our decisions. Most parents that do not vaccinate have gotten their information straight from the CDC and FDA. I don't know a single person who lists Jenny McCarthy as their reason or influence for not vaccinating. Every parent has the right to choose what is best for their child and their family. If you're going to get mad at parents that don't vaccinate their children be sure that you are up to date on all your vaccinations and boosters, over 50% of adults aren't. And all kids in Alabama public schools do not have to be vaccinated, it's a recommendation not a requirement.

And all kids in Alabama public schools do not have to be vaccinated, it's a recommendation not a requirement. I am up to date, as are all the adults in our family. Our children have young children, who are also being vaccinated according to the recommended schedule. I do practice what I preach. It is truly sad that educated people choose not to vaccinate based on what, to be blunt, is unscientific nonsense. I do not know any MDs that do not vaccinate. It is something I have discussed with more than a few, including pediatricians that tell of the time they must spend trying to educate parents. The bottom line is that parents who decide not to vaccinate either cannot evaluate the risks and benefits of vaccines or they know darn well that the benefits outweigh the risks but decide they can hide in the herd. That way their kids avoid even minuscule risk but probably will not get sick. The famous Dr. Bob Sears was caught out advising parents to do just that. He also told them to not tell their neighbors what they were doing because if too many people do not vaccinate the herd protection disappears. That is exactly what is happening in some areas of the country. I would be very interested in reading any information from the CDC and FDA that supports not vaccinating children by the schedule suggested by the infectious disease experts.
