The problem is we get used to not feeling well. Did you know that there are amazing detox therapies available? And you don't have to be a yogi to do them. Most of them are natural and very safe and non-toxic, as well as scientifically proven. We regularly use: - Angel of Water Colon Hydrotherapy - Glutathione IVs - Hydration IVs - Ozone Saunas - Liver Support - Nutritional Counseling - Lifestyle Consultation Dr. Melanie Icard Naturopathic Medical Doctor You will be assessed by Dr. Icard and team to qualify for the protocol. We highly recommend healthy eating 3 days before with plenty of water intake and no heavy food 3 hours before your colon hydrotherapy session. We may recommend you to do the protocol over 2 visits. Angel of Water Colon Hydrotherapy is a clinic favorite and has been used widely throughout the world. Colon hydrotherapy, also known as colonics, is the gentle infusion of water into the colon to cleanse it of accumulated waste material, gas, mucus, undigested foods and other toxins. Ithelps improve muscle tone, facilitating the natural peristaltic action necessary for efficient removal of waste and absorption of nutrients. Toxic waste build up can be the root of a variety of different health concerns. Stress can also lead to tension in the gut, even in the healthiest of people and allow this release is highly beneficial not only physically but emotionally and clients often report feeling lighter and clearer after therapy. The Angel of Water is an open system so it is much more comfortable than more common closed systems. This is excellent for detox, digestive issues, stress, basically for everyone. If you eat 3 meals a day and have less than 3 bowel movements a day, get in for the Angel of Water and feel amazing. Glutathione IV is another clinic favorite that is immune boosting and detoxing (not to mention great for your skin!). We utilize it in supporting the liver at our clinic which is burdened by all the toxins we encounter known and unknow as well as stress. Many skin conditions are linked to the liver and toxicity and will improve with glutathione therapy. Glutathione is a combination of amino acids, so it's natural, not a medicine and it helps our liver remove toxins from our body. Ozone Sauna the gentle healer. The ozone sauna is an enjoyable and popular way to detox. You sit inside a chamber that your head sticks out of while steam and ozone go all over your body's skin, your largest organ of your body. An interesting phenomenon is the grey debris/sweat that is often seen on towels that were next to the feet or sacrum. This phenomenon is especially obvious in cigarette smokers and patients that have previously had toxic drugs like chemotherapy or radiation treatments. Enjoy skin improvement, immune improvement, decrease in body pain and anti-viral properties with the detox effects of this sauna. Hydration IV before your colon hydrotherapy session will help the body allow the detox process more gently. Water is life. What You'll Do Before the Appointment After being screened for any contraindications, we will do an initial intake to be aware of any medications you take and present or past health conditions. A list is helpful and much appreciated. Try to eat lighter and healthier 3 days before the appointment, avoid alcohol, be hydrated, avoid heavily eating or drinking fluids 2-3 hours before the appointment. If you have a fever or cough please call to reschedule your appointment. What Happens During the Appointment After some brief paperwork you will meet one on one with Dr. Icard and staff to make a personalized detox plan. We will offer you water and relaxation vitamins and after some vitals start you with your hydration IV. You sit back and relax. Then you will get orientated to your colon hydrotherapy room with your therapist. They will step out so you can insert the nozzle yourself and return to assist you in your session offering coaching, reflexology, abdominal massage, and essential oils as indicated. Feel free to ask them to leave or stay. We have a recommended diet and lifestyle plan to decrease inflammation and not suppress your immune system. What's Next? Depending on your plan you will you rest and rehydrate and check in with your therapist before leaving; then come back in the next 1-3 days for glutathione IV and ozone sauna. Or we can start glutathione IV and follow with ozone sauna session. You may require multiple detox packages or more of certain therapies and we can customize a package for your needs for a lifestyle of healthy living, good body function, and good energy.
