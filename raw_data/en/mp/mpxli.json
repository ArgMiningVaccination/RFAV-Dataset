We are honored to host you at the 2014 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems. We hope you enjoy the technical excellence and innovation on display at IROS 2014. We received over 1600 paper submissions and nearly 50 workshop and tutorial submissions. Ultimately 750 papers and 27 workshops and tutorials were selected for the final program, with authors from near ly 50 countries from around the world. This year, for the first time, IROS is exper imenting with a new format, where each paper is assigned a 3-minute oral presentation and an 80-minute interactive presentation. Each oral session consists of up to 20 3-minute presentations along with one session keynote. In the session immediately follo wing an oral presentation, the presenter presents the work in an interactive session, with the aid of their laptop and an LCD screen, to any attendee whose interest was piqued by the oral presentation. This format allows the number of parallel oral sessions to be shrunk to three, potentially providing larger audiences for the oral presentation, while creat ing an opportunity for more significant interaction with attendees with related interests. This \"pitch plus interactive\" format has been used with success in the smaller, single- track RSS conference. It was also experimented with for a subset of papers at IROS 2011. At ICRA 2012 and ICRA 2013, some papers were chosen for purely interactive presentations (no oral presentations) while others were purely oral presentations. As the robotics community continues to experiment with formats to best serve conference- goers, we decided to try the experiment of treating all papers identically, as \"pitch plus interactive.\" This contrasts with ICRA 2014, which used up to 19 parallel sessions in the \"traditional\" format. Feedback on the merits of these approaches w ill be sought from the robotics community, and this feedback will in fluence future conf erence organization. Potential benefits of the \"pitch pl us interactive\" format incl ude a conference that is more physically compact and easier to navigate; potentially wider exposure for presenters' work; encouraging concise and effective pres entations; a possibility to see a wider cross-section of current wo rk in robotics; and greater opportunity for significant interaction and networking, particularly for more junior researchers. It also allows each paper to be treated identically, instead of some papers being selected for interactive presentations and some for oral presentati ons. Challenges include greater A/V support and technical and timing requirements; less in-depth technical presentations on topics that are of interest to you; moving between rooms during talks; and predicting attendance at oral vs. interactive presentations. In addition to the new conference format, IROS 2014 features 39 session keynotes by leaders in the field; three plenary speeches; a vibrant industrial exhibition and talks from sponsors; special forums and panels on industry and entrepreneurship and government policy as it relates to robotics; and a number of other special events including lunches sponsored by the Robotics Society of Japan and the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society. Time to socialize with colleagues and potential collaborators is also vital to a good conference, and IROS 2014 provides plenty of opportunities. In addition to the welcome 1and farewell receptions, the coffee breaks in the Exhibit Hall, and the banquet at the Art Institute of Chicago, the Monday night Explore Chicago social events allow attendees to customize their Chicago experience to their ow n interests. You can experience one of a variety of uniquely Chicago events: a river and lake architecture cruise, a Chicago Cubs baseball game, a show at the Second City Comedy Club, a blues show at Buddy Guy's Legends, or a bicycle ride along the Chicago lakefront, among others. Putting together an event like this requires a tremendous amount of volunteer effort. We are fortunate to have an out standing Organizing Co mmittee. If you see one of them, please thank them for their effort! Special recognition must go to the Conferenc e Paper Review Board, which handled over 5000 reviews of the submitted papers and helped the Senior Program Committee pick the very best contributions for IROS 2014. The technical expertise of the CPRB was invaluable. Our deepest gratitude goes to Wolfra m Burgard, the Editor-in-Chief of the CPRB, for his ethical, efficient, and professi onal handling of the entire review process. Again, welcome to Chicago. We hope you find IROS 2014 both professionally and personally rewarding!

After its founding, it was the fastest growing city in the world for several decades due in large part to its location. The Chicago flag, four stars between two blue stripes, reflects the importance of Chicago's location: the stars represent important events in Chicago's history and the two blue stripes represent the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River. The Great Chicago Fire broke out in 1871 destroying an area of about 12 square kilometers, a major percentage of the city at the time. The fire gave birth to an urban architectural renewal that included legendary architects such as Daniel Burnham, Louis Sullivan, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. The first skyscrapers in the world, built using steel-skeleton construction, also appeared in Chicago soon after the fire. Chicago is now an architectural mecca and boasts the tallest building in the US not counting spires (the Willis Tower) and four of the seven tallest in the US (Trump Tower, Aon Center, and the John Hancock Center). The world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa, was designed by the Chicago firm of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill. In 1893, Chicago hosted the World's Columbian Exposition (the \"White City\"), where the first Ferris wheel was unveiled. The Chicago Museum of Science and Industry is the only major building remaining from the Columbian Exposition. The University of Chicago is built largely on the site of the Exposition. The Chicago River, which runs through the c enter of downtown Ch icago, originally flowed into Lake Michigan. Pollution from the city found its way to water intakes in Lake Michigan, fouling the drinking water for Chicagoans. In 1900 a major public works project was completed to reverse the flow of the Chicago River using a series of locks. The river now flows from Lake Michigan toward the Mississippi River. This achievement was named a \"Civil Engineering Monument of the Millennium\" by t he American Society of Civil Engineers. Today, Chicago is the third largest city in the US, after New York and Los Angeles, with 2.7 million people in the city itself and nearly 10 million in the su rrounding \"Chicagoland\" area. O'Hare International Airport is the second busiest in the world. Chicago is home to several major universities, including Northweste rn University, the University of Chicago, the University of Illinoi s at Chicago, and the Illi nois Institute of Technol ogy. It is home to a thriving sports, arts, theater, improvisational comedy, and music scene. Chicago's 8nicknames include the \"Second City\" (due to its relationship to New York City; this nickname was also adopted by the famed comedy troupe), the \"Windy City\" (thought to be due to the weather or perhaps the windbag po liticians), and the \"City of Big Shoulders\" (from a poem by Carl Sandburg). The Palmer House Hilton The first Palmer House, known simply as \"The Palmer,\" was built as a wedding present from Potter Palmer to his wife Bertha Honore Palmer. It opened on September 26, 1871, but burned down just 13 days later in the Great Chicago Fire. Potter Palmer began construction on the sec ond Palmer House immediately after, completing the seven-story building in 1875. It was one of the most lavish hotels in the world at the time. As business in Chicago continued to boom, supporting a larger hotel, a third Palmer House was built on the site of the second. It was built in stages so that the hotel was never closed. Construction of the 25-floor building was completed in 1925. In 1945 the Palmer House was acquired by Conrad Hilt on, becoming the Palmer House Hilton. Today the Palmer House Hilton is well known for its prime location in the Chicago Loop and its extravagant Beaux Arts ceiling mural in the lobby. The Loop \"The Loop\" refers to the central business and arts district of Chicago where the Palmer House Hilton is located. It is believed that the name of \"the Loop\" derives from the fact that Chicago L trains (elevated trains) run in a loop around this area. Things to Do For information on things to do in Chicago, check out the conference website www.iros2014.org, the Choose Chicago website http:// www.choosechicago.com/, or tripadvisor.com. The Palmer House Hilton is in a prime location for many Chicago attractions. Attractions within walking distance or a short taxi ride include the Art Institute of Chicago, the Field Museum of Natural History, the Shedd Aquarium, the Adler Planetarium, Navy Pier, the Cloud Gate sculpture (affectionately known as \"the Bean\") at Millennium Park, shopping on State Street or the Magnificent Mile (North Michigan Avenue), many theaters, the Lyric O pera, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Chicago Cultural Center, boat cruises of the river and lake, and famous architecture such as the Willis Tower, John Hancock Center, the Tr ibune Tower, the Trump Tower, the Wrigley Building, and the Rookery. Safety The area around the Palmer House Hilton is popular with tourists and is safe to walk at all hours. You may encounter panhandlers requesting coins, but they should not be aggressive. 9Transportation By Air Chicago is served by two major airports, O'Hare International Airport (ORD) and Midway International Airport (MDW). O'Hare is the second-busiest airport in the world with direct connections to many cities nationally and internationally. To get from the airport to the Palmer House, you can take a taxi or the less-expensive Chicago train system (the 'L'). See more information below. By Taxi Taxis are available at almost any time at almost any location in the downtown Chicago area. Simply raise your hand to hail a taxi. It is customary to tip the taxi driver 10-20% of the fare for good service. At O'Hare and Midway, follow the signs fr om the baggage claim area to the taxi stand. Never accept a ride from a taxi that has not been selected for you by the person working at the taxi stand. A taxi from O'Hare to the Palmer House, 17 East Monroe St, Chicago, costs $40-50 and can take 30 minutes in li ght traffic and up to 90 minutes in heavy traffic, such as rush hour. A taxi from Midway costs $30-40 and takes 20 minutes to an hour depending on traffic. Taxis in Chicago are required to accept credit cards in addition to cash. By the CTA Elevated Train (the 'L') The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) operates buses and trains. The most convenient is the elevated train system, or 'L.' The L train system serves both major airports and has stops very close to the Palmer House. At the airports, follow the signs for trains to the city. From O'Hare, take the Blue Line 18 stops (about 41 minutes) to the Monroe (Blue Line) station. Walk one block east on Monroe St to the Palmer House. From Midway, take the Orange Line 8 stops (about 24 minutes ) to the Harold Washington Library station. Walk three blocks north on State St and turn right (east) on Monroe St to reach the Palmer House. ALERT: The Blue Line between O'Hare and Monroe is experiencing occasional periods of construction. You may have to transfer to a bus for part of the ride, then get back on the train to complete your trip. The transfer is free (you just need to use your card again), but this may add 10-20 minutes to your trip. You can check the CTA website as to whether any construction will be occurring w hen you arrive. If you prefer to avoid the hassle, take a taxi. To ride the L, buy a single-ride ticket at a machine at the L station by paying $3.00 (or $5.00 from O'Hare). When you enter the gates to reach the platform, touch your ticket to the card reader. You don't need the card at the exit. The L is an inexpensive alternative to taxis. You can find the L system map and other information at the Chicago Transit Authority website http://www.transitchicago.com/maps. Walking The conference location (17 E Monroe St) is in a busy financial, shopping, and arts district, and is in easy walking distance of many attractions and restaurants. Most Chicago streets run east-west or north-south and use a coordinate system, with State St (a north-south street) serving as the zero axis for east-west, and Madison St (an east- 10west street) serving as the zero axis for north-south. Addresses that differ numerically by 800 in the east-west direction or north-south direction are 1 mile (1.6 km) apart; for example, 800 N Michigan Ave and 400 S Michigan Ave are separated by 1.5 miles (2.4 km). See the coordinate grid below. Bicycling Chicago is a bike-friendly city. The easiest biking is along the Lakefront Trail, which runs 18 miles (29 km) along Lake Michigan from the north end of the city to the south end. This is also the best way to see the city. T here are also numerous bike lanes within the downtown area. The closest place to rent a bike for an extended bike ride is at the Millennium Park location of Bike and Roll, 239 E Randolph St. For shorter rides, the Chicago Divvy bike system allows you to pay $7.00 for 24-hour use of bikes at convenient locations across the city. As thes e bikes are intended for transportation from one site to another, each ride must be less than 30 minutes to avoid incurring extra charges. Learn more at the Divvy website.

You can find more information at the Adler's website http://www.adlerplanetarium.org/adler-after-dark/ . 13Explore Chicago Social Events Monday September 15 On Monday night, eight social events will be held at vari ous spots around Chicago. Each conference registration comes with a ticket to one event. All transit to the social events will be by walking or public transportation (the L). To take t he L, use a single-ride ticket when you enter (available for purchase at all stations for $3 if you don't have one); it's not needed at the exit. It is highly recommended that you meet your group in the Palmer House lobby or near the registration de sks at the times indicat ed below. Further inform ation on the social event locations is given below in case you get separated from your group. Remember the Palmer House is at 17 E Monroe St, at t he corner of Monroe St and Wabash Ave. Bicycling the Lakefront Trail (meet at 5:00 PM in lobby): This is the best way to see the Chicago skyline and lakefront, and to get a little exercise at the same time. The IROS group will be led by severa l tourguides on a bicy cling tour of the city's lakefront. Bicycles will be leaving from the Bike and Roll storefr ont at 239 E Randolph St in Millennium Park. This is a 1 km walk from t he Palmer House. Go east on Monroe St to Michigan Ave, north on Michigan Ave to Randolph St, and east on Randolph St to 239 E Randolph. Blues Show at Buddy Guy's Legends (meet at 7:00 PM at the registration desks): Chicago is famous for the blues, the prec ursor of rock and roll. Buddy Guy, a Chicago blues legend and winner of the National Medal of Arts and the Kennedy Center Honors, runs Buddy Guy's Legends, just down the road from the Palmer House. You will have dinner and enjoy a show at this iconic Chicago club. Buddy Guy's is at 700 S Wabash Ave, a 1 km wa lk from the Palmer House. Walk south on Wabash Ave. Dinner will be provided at the show. Chicago Cubs Baseball Game at Wrigley Field (meet at 5:50 PM in lobby): Wrigley Field is the 100-year-old hom e of the Chicago Cubs. You w ill experience the excitement and party atmosphere of Wrigleyville and a gam e against the Cincinnati Reds. This is recommended for people who like rowdy fun crowds, big outdoor parties, or just want to learn a bit about baseball. Wrigley Field is a 20-minute ride on the CTA L Red Line (10 km by taxi). Take the Red Line toward Howard from the Monroe station at the corner of State St and Monroe St (\u00bd block west of the Palmer House) and get off at the Addison stop. To return, you can take the Red Line back from Addison, but the station may be very crowded at the end of the game. In that case, it is recommended you make a group of three or four people and take a taxi back to the Palmer House (approximately $20). You may need to walk east on Addison a couple of blocks to get away from the crowds to find an open taxi. Alternatively, leave before the end of the gam e or hit a Wrigleyville bar after the game until the crowds dissipate. Bars on Clark St are especially popular. Chicago River and Lake Michigan Cruise (meet at 5:30 PM in lobby): Have a drink, relax, and enjoy the architecture of Chicago at sunset on this cruise of the Chicago River, through the lock, and out to Lake Michigan. 14The cruise boats will leave from the dock east of the Trump Tower north of the Chicago River. It is a 1 km walk north on Wabash Ave. After crossing the river, go down to the walkway along the river and go east to the Wendella dock. Drinks will be provided on the boat, but no food. Chocolate Tasting Tour of Chica go (meet at 5:10 PM in lobby): Take a fun and informative guided walking and tasting tour of Chicago chocolate shops, from secret treasures to famous favorites. The sweetest tour in town! The tour will start at the Visitor Informati on Center in the lower level of the Macy's building at 111 N State St. Walk west a half block and then north on State St (less than \u00bd km). Goose Island Brew Pub and Brewery Tour (meet at 6:20 PM in lobby): Chicago's original microbrewery. Enjoy some pub fare, a tasting of several of Goose Island's beers, and a tour of the brewery. Goose Island is at 1800 N Clybourn Ave, 5 km fr om the Palmer House.

Once upon a time they were closely related and investigated, separately and together, in AI labs around the world. Vision has always been a hard problem, and early roboticists struggled to make vision work using the slow computers of the day \u2014 particularly for metric problems like understanding the geometry of the world. In the 1990s affordable laser rangefinders entered the scene and roboticists adopted them with enthusiasm, delighted with the metric information they could provide. Since that time laser-based perception has come to dominate robotics, while processing images from databases, not from robots, has come to dominate computer vision. What happened to that early partnership between robotics and vision? Is it forever broken, or is now the time to reconsider vision as an effecti ve sensor for robotics? This ta lk will trace the history of robotics and vision, examine t he state of the art and di scuss what may happen in the future. Biography Peter Corke is Professor of Robotics and Control at Queensland University of Technology, and Director of the Australian Centre of Ex cellence for Robotic Vision. His research spans topics including visual servoing, high-speed hardware for machine vision, field robotics, particularly for mining and environmental monitoring, and sensor networks. He has written two books: \"Robotics, Vision & Control\" (2011) and \"Visual Control of Robots\" (1997); developed the Robotics and Machine Vision Toolboxes for MATLAB; was Editor-in-Chief of the IEEE Robotics and Automation magazine (2010- 13); was a founding editor of the Journal of Field Robotics; is a member of the editorial boards of the International Journal of Robotics Research and the Springer STAR series; and is a Fellow of the IEEE. He received a Bachelor of Engineering (Electrical), Masters and PhD all from the University of Melbourne. 23Plenary II Development of Neural Interfaces for Robotic Prosthetic Limbs Todd Kuiken Rehabilitation Inst of Chicago and Northwestern University Tuesday September 16, 8:00-8:50 Grand/State Ballroom Abstract The ability to control complex robot pros theses is evolving qui ckly. I will describe research at the Center for Bionic Medicine/ Rehabilitation Instit ute of Chicago and Northwestern University to develop a neural-machine interface to improve the function of artificial limbs. We have developed a surgical technique called Ta rgeted Reinnervation to use nerve transfers for improvement of robot ic arm control and to provide sensation of the missing hand. By transferring the residual arm nerves in an upper limb amputee to spare regions of muscle it is possible to make new electromyographic (EMG) signals for the control of robotic arms. These signals are di rectly related to the original function of the lost limb and allow simultaneous control of multiple joints in a natural way. This work has now been extended by the use of pattern recognition algorith ms that decode the user's intent, enabling the intuitive control of many more functions of the prostheses. Similarly, hand sensation nerves can be made to grow into spare skin on the residual limb so that when this skin is touched, t he amputee feels like their missing hand is being touched. This is a potential port to providing physiologically correct sensory feedback to amputees. Our team is now also devel oping a neural interface for powered leg prostheses that enables intuitive mobility based on a fusion of residual limb EMG and sensors in the robotic leg. Biography Todd A. Kuiken received a B.S. degree in bi omedical engineering from Duke University (1983), a Ph.D. in biomedical engineering from Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois (1989) and an M.D. from Northwestern Un iversity Medical School (1990). He is a board-certified physiatrist at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago. He is the Director of the Center for Bionic Medicine at the Rehabilitation Inst itute of Chicago and a Professor in the Depts. of Physic al Medicine and Rehab ilitation, Bioomedica l Engineering, and Surgery at Northwestern University. Dr. Kuik en is an internationally respected leader in the care of people with limb loss, both as an active treating physician and as a research scientist. He developed a novel surgical tec hnique called Targeted Reinnervation which has now been successfully performed on over 100 people with amputations worldwide. His research is broadly published in journals including the New England Journal of Medicine, JAMA, Lancet and PNAS. 24Plenary III From Visual SLAM to Generic Real-time 3D Scene Perception Andrew Davison Imperial College London Wednesday September 17, 8:00-8:50 Grand/State Ballroom Abstract I will argue that a coherent stream of research in roboti cs and computer vision is leading us from the visual SLAM systems of the pas t 15+ years towards the generic real-time 3D scene understanding c apabilities whic h will enable the next genera tion of smart robots and mobile devices. SLAM is the problem of joint estimation of a robot's motion and t he structure of the environment it moves through, and cameras of a variety of types are now the main outward looking sensors us ed to achieve this. While early visual SLAM systems concentrated on real-time localisation as their main output, the latest ones are now capable of dense and detailed 3D reconstructi on and, increasingly, semantic labelling and object awareness. A crucial factor in this progress has been how continuing improvements in commodity processing per formance has enabled algorithms previously considered \"off-line\" in computer vision res earch to become part of real-time systems. But we believe this is far from the whol e story: when estimation of qualities such as object identity is undertaken during a real-t ime loop together with localisation, 3D reconstruction and possibly even interaction or manipulation, the predictions and context continuously available should make things much easier; leading to robustness and computational efficiency which feeds back and is self-reinforcing. This in our view is what keeps progress towards generic real-time scene understanding firmly in the domain of the SLAM ways of thinking, where incremental, real-time processing is used to make globally consistent scene estimates by repeatedly comparing live data against predictions and update probabilis tic models accordingly. I will describe and connect much of the research that I and others have conducted in Visual SLAM over the recent years, with examples from my own work from MonoSLAM through systems like DTAM, KinectFusion and SLAM++. Biography Andrew Davison received the B.A. degree in physics and the D.Phil. degree in computer vision from the University of Oxford in 1994 and 1998, respectively. In his doctorate with Prof. David Murray at Oxford's Robotics Research Group he devel oped one of the first robot SLAM systems using vision. He spent two years as a post-doc at AIST, Tsukuba, Japan, where he continued to work on visual robot navigation. In 2000 he returned to the University of Oxford and as an EPSRC Advanced Research Fellow from 2002 he developed the well known MonoSLAM algorithm for real-time SLAM with a single camera. He joined Imperial College London as a Lecturer in 2005, held an ERC Starting Grant from 2008 to 2013 and was promoted to Professor in 2012. His Robot Vision Research Group continues to focus on advancing the basic technology of real-time 25localisation and mapping using vision, publishing advances in particular on real-time dense reconstruction and tracking, large scale map optimisation, high speed vision and tracking, object-level mapping and the use of par allel processing in vision. He maintains a deep interest in exploring t he limits of computational efficiency in real-time vision problems. In 2014 he became the founding Director of the new Dyson Robotics Laboratory at Imperial College, a lab working on the applications of computer vision to real-world domestic robots where there is much potential to open up new product categories. 26Special Events Conference Welcome Monday September 15, 8:00-8:20 Grand/State Ballrooms Chair: Kevin Lynch The official conference openi ng will precede Plenary I.

Williams (University of Southern California), A. Gaspa rri (Universit\u00e0 degli studi \"Roma http://asimov.usc.edu/~rkwillia/ws/iros14/ Abstract: Given the fragmented natur e of multi-robot research, we suggest that a taxonomic approach is necessary to study the topics that drive interconnected systems, and to identify properties that underlie cruc ial, and yet common, aspects of theory and application. In this first workshop of a se ries, we will focus on topology in distributed robotics, which dictates robotic interac tion in a system. Properties such as graph connectivity and network rigidi ty will be highlighted, with emphasis on communicated, sensed, and physical robotic interaction. This workshop aims to i dentify the theoretical possibilities w hen topological assumptions are satisfied, the real-w orld barriers, and the current efforts to enforce topological properties in multi-robot theory and practice.

The package provides an API for creating ROS nodes in MATLAB that operate and communicate based on ROS's publisher/subscriber mechanism. The ROS I/O Package has the following key features: (1) Enable creation of ROS nodes, publishers, and subscribers directly from MATLAB; (2) Enable creation of ROS messages from MATLAB; (3) Enable publishers to publish MATLAB data to their advertised topics; (4) Enable subscribers to execute arbitrary, user-defined MATLAB functions when messages are received; (5) Enable launching of a ROS Master in MATLAB. In addition, we will also demonstr ate how to develop robotics applications with TurtleBot, Husky from Clearpath Robotics and Baxter from Rethink Robotics inside MATLAB using this I/O. Speakers: Ren (MathWorks) Sunday Sept 14, 13:30-17:00, State Ballroom Organizers: Lorenz Meier (ETH Zurich), Markus W. Achtelik (ETH Zurich), and Brandon Basso (3D Robotics) Website: http://pixhawk.org/iros2014/ Abstract: With ever increasing levels of autonomy and system complexity, open source collaboration has become an important factor in robotics research. Whether structured in an environment with managed software packages like ROS or shared ad-hoc, the ability to push the boundaries of autonomous robots often depends on the availability of existing work to build on. Open source robotics is by now well established in ground robotics. As aerial robotics is moving from tackling relatively self-contained navigation tasks like the flight in GPS denied environments towards addressing dynamic scenes and more challenging dynamic obstacles, open source is equally important. This workshop is providing participants a solid overview of the current state of the art in aerial robotics research. It also provides exampl es of open source solutions ranging from SLAM packages for onboard computers to open hardware autopilots. Speakers: Nathan Michael (CMU), Markus W. Achtelik (ETH Zurich), Elias Mueggler (University of Zurich) and Lorenz Meier (ETH Zurich) 37Full-Day Workshop: Human-robot collaboration in standardization and R&D activities Sunday Sept 14, 8:30-17:00, Salon 1 Univ, Hungary), http://www.clawar.org/WorkshopHRC/index.html Abstract: The workshop aims to create clos er links between robot standardization and robot R&D sectors for tar geting rapid development of e ffective human-robot market driven solutions to meet mandatory regulat ions.

Consequently, there is a lack of mainstream AI venues for publishing integrative research that combines techniques from multiple different fields to achieve a working robot system capable of complex behavior. This workshop aims to bring together a diverse and multidisciplinary group of researchers interested in desi gning intelligent robotic systems. Ample time will be left in the schedule for both spontaneous and guided discussions between presentations. A final open-floor di scussion will aim at summa rizing the main outcom es of the workshop around those questions, and planning the next steps for widening and consolidating the community.

Schoellig (U . of Toronto), Lydia Tapia (U. of New Mexico), Aleksandra Faust (U. of New Zurich) Website: http://www.cs.unm.edu/ amprg/mlpc14Workshop/ Abstract: It is the goal of this workshop to explore methods and advancements afforded by the integration of Machine Learning for the planning and execution of robot motion. Because ML methods are often heuristic, i ssues such as safety and performance are critical to assess. Also , learning-based questions su ch as problem learnability, knowledge transfer among robots, knowledge generalization, long-term autonomy, task formulation, demonstration, role of simulation, and methods for feature selection define problem solvability. We will address these issues while discussi ng current and future directions for intelligent planning and execution of motions for robotics systems. Speakers: Pieter Abbeel (UC Berkeley), Jan Veloso (CMU) Full-Day Workshop: Modular and Swarm Systems - from Nature to Robotics Sunday Sept 14, 8:30-17:00, Salon 5 Organizers: R. Gross (The University of Sheffiel d), R. M\u00f6ckel (Maastricht University), M. Rubenstein (Harvard University), K. Stoy (IT University of Copenhagen) Website: https://sites.google.com/site/iros2014mss/ Abstract: This full-day workshop creates a forum to discuss the highly interdisciplinary fields of modular robotics and swarm robotics. Modularity is a concept well exploited by natural systems where relatively simple modules form highly complex structures. In swarm systems, physically independent entitie s or modules collaborate to perform common tasks. The fields of modular and swarm robotics have shown to be ideal playgrounds to study, for instance, self-organization, self-assembly, smart materials, self-repair, adaptation, collaboration, social interac tion, and distribut ed intelligence in robotic and natural sy stems. State-of -the-art modular and sw arm robot systems will be presented at the workshop's robot exhibition. Speakers: N. Correll (University of Colorado at B oulder), D. Floreano (EPFL), S. Glotzer (University of Michigan), S. C. Goldstein (Carnegie Mellon University), D. L. Hu (Georgia Institute of Technology), M. D. Gross (Car negie Mellon University & Modular Robotics Inc.), D.

DNA machines, synthetic bacteria, nanoparticles, and magnetic materials are now able to move, sense and interact in a controlled fashion, an affordance that has led them to be call ed robots. These robots will need to be deployed in large numbers and operate pr edictably in highly complex biological environments. The challenge is to design swarm robotic strategies that produce collective behaviors that are useful for biomedical applicati ons. In this interd isciplinary workshop, attendees will hear from experts in medicine, bioengineering, micro-nano robotics, and swarm robotics. The workshop includes two poster sessions and a closing panel discussion.

One of the main reasons for integrating vision in t he control loop was the interest fo r increased flexibility of robotic systems. However, versatility of vision systems comes at the cost of higher data processing complexity. Visual control has been one of the major research issues in robotics for more than four decades. Although control theory and co mputer vision are both mature areas of research, important advances that bring new challenges are happening nowadays such as the advent of RGB-D cameras, the use of omnidirectional vision, or the development of robust control techniques. Topics of interest include: Autonomous navigation and visual servoing techniques, visual perception for visual control, visual sensors, visual control with constraints, or new trends in visual control. Speakers: Philippe Martinet (IRCCYN-CNRS, Ecole Centrale de Nantes), and Peter Corke (Queensland University of Technology) Half-Day Workshop: Standardized Knowledge Representation and Ontologies for Robotics and Automation Thursday Sept 18, 13:30 -17:00, State Ballroom Organizers: est.ipcb.pt/laboratorios/ robotica/iros-ora Abstract: The primary goal of this workshop is to present and disse minate the current versions of standards and draft standards regarding robot interaction and knowledge sharing.

A new and lively research trend for such robotic systems relies on declarative and cons traint-based task and mo tion specification. This workshop intends to encourage discussion between researchers working in constraint-based motion planning and control, covering various aspects of this problem. Speakers: Oliver Brock (TU Berlin), Fabrizio Fla cco (University of Rome), Kris Hauser (University of Indiana), Erwi n Aertbelien (KU Leuven), Luis Sent is (University of Texas), and others. Full-Day Workshop: Robots in Clutter: Perception and Interaction in Clutter Thursday Sept 18, 8:30-17:00, Salon 3 Organizers: Michael Zillich (V ienna Maren (University of Piat er Fox (King's College London) Website: http://workshops.acin.tu wien.ac.at/clutter2014 Abstract: Complex and cluttered environments continue to present challenging problems to many aspects of robotics resear ch. Vision faces the problem of segmenting or recognising objects amidst clutter and occlusions. Unexpected scene changes pose challenges for maintaining valid and tract able scene representati ons for navigation, especially in highly dynamic scenes as encountered in self-driving cars. Manipulation cannot expect precise pose knowledge of all objects in a pile, let alone contact relations. All these problems will become increasingly m anifest as robots move into unstructured domestic, industrial or outdoor settings. What is meant by \"robust to clutter\"', however, is difficult to define and adequate metrics and benchmarks are s till missing. This workshop discusses experiences and ideas for handling various problems induced by clutter, and to advance theoretically founded and system-wide approaches of handling clutter. Speakers: Oliver Brock (TU Berlin), Franceso Ferro (PAL Robotics), Tucker Hermans (to be confirmed) (Georgia Tech), Chris Mansley (Robert /g1 /g1 /g1/g1 45Full-Day Workshop: Community Consensus Benchmarks and Systems for Clinical Translation of Medical Robots Thursday Sept 18, 8:30-17:00, Salon 4 Organizers: Nabil Simaan (Vanderbilt University), Venkat Krovi (SUNY Buffalo), Peter Kazanzides (Johns Hopkins University), Simon DiMaio (Intuitive Surgical, Inc.) Website: https://sites.google.com/s ite/ieeerasmedicalrobotics/ Abstract: The past decade has witnessed accelera ted growth of medical robotics and computer-assisted medical tec hnologies due to the significant practical utility, economic value, and diversity of applications benefiting patients, providers and healthcare systems. However, several challenges arise from the complexities engendered within the human body and the diverse sets of multi-disciplinary knowledge that need to be merged to create these system-level solutions and to successfully bring them to the market. We believe that there is a need for the robotics and medical device community to initiate a discussion on several issues that could benefit academia and industry in their shared pursuit of improved patient care. We therefor e propose to initiate the first of a series of workshops at the 2014 IEEE/RSJ Internati onal Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) Chicago.

A comprehens ive understanding of surgeon sensorimotor control is fundamental to continuing improvements of teleoperated robot- assisted minimally invasive surgery platforms. Such platforms may also enable exciting findings in basic human sensorimotor control. To advance this new interdisciplinary research direction, we seek to foster a dialogue between the fields of: (1) human motor control and learning; (2) human-robot interaction, teleoperation, and surgical robotics; and (3) surgical training and skill assessment.

Even so, how to engineer a telerobotic system, which is complex enough to be truly useful in practice, yet, still easy to operate even with limited information-exchange and/or imperfect communication, has been a form idable challenge for the telerobotics community. The main aim of this 3rd Telerobotics Workshop is to provide a forum for exchange of ideas among the users and researchers, to discuss challenges and barriers to real-life applications of teleroboti cs systems and to explore innovative/promising solutions to these problems Speakers: Simon DiMaio (Intuitive Surgical), Hyoung Il Son (Samsung Heavy Industries), Eric Martin (Canadian Space A gency), Jordi Artigas-Esclusa (DLR), Full-Day Workshop: Compliant Manipulation: Challenges in Learning and 7 Abstract: Robust and versatile compliant manipula tion skills are a necessity for robots interacting with the real world. Despite significant progress in design of passively compliant mechanisms and active compliance control algorithms, t oday's best robots are still far behind humans in terms of manipul ation performance and versatility. This workshop will identify current challenges in compliant manipulat ion problems and will address how recent advances in learning and control can be leveraged to advance the state of the art in th is area of research.

With the recent development of fully torque-controlled robots, theory can be put into practice. The main aim of this workshop is to bring together leading researchers in the field of WBC i) to paint a clear picture of the fa st evolving state-of-the- art, ii) to encourage discussions on the current limitations, and on the future research directions, and iii) to develop new research collaborations to speed up the creation of reliable real world WBC Syst ems. Emphasis will be placed on the application of such systems on real robots perfo rming tasks in the real wo rld, and the speakers will be invited to share their hands-on experience. Speakers: A. Del Ott (DLR), L. Righetti (MPI), L. Sentis Austin), R. Wensing Orin (OSU) /g1 49Oral and Interactive Sessions IROS 2014 has only three para llel oral tracks, and each paper is assigned a 3-minute oral presentation as well as an 80-minute inte ractive presentation. After giving the oral presentation in one session, the speaker moves to the Interactive Salons during the next session to talk in more detail with anyone who would like to learn more. Some oral sessions also feature talks by industrial sponsors. Speaker Instructions Your presentation has two components: a three-minute pitch and an 80-minute interactive presentation. This will afford you the opportunity to pres ent your work to a large audience (there are only three parallel speaking sessions) and to interact more deeply with those who are interested to learn more. The Pitch Setup For the speaking sessions, you will come to the front of the room at the beginning of the session. Speakers with odd-numbered talks (talks 1, 3, 5, etc.) speak from the left podium from the audience's viewpoint, while s peakers with even-numbered talks (2, 4, 6, etc.) speak from the right podium. While the speaker before you is speaking, you will have three minutes to set up your laptop. (VGA connection will be provided.) There will be a volunteer at the podium to help you if you need it. There will be a local m onitor on the podium t hat shows what will project from your laptop to the screen, so you can be su re that the audience will see what you see on the monitor. There will be no audio hookup for your computer. When the previous speaker finishes, t heir microphone will go dead, yours will become live, your monitor will be projec ted to the main screen, and the spotlight will shift to you. Your three minutes starts right then and you can begin your talk. If you fail to connect during your three-minute setup time (which should be very rare), a secondary screen will always project the summary slide you submitt ed including the title of your paper and the authors' names with the speaker underlined. Again, your three minutes starts right then and you should complete your talk within the allotted time, only referring to this summary slide. Speakers can test their laptops on a simulat ed setup in the Ashland Room (see the hotel map) to make sure everything is working properly. Presenting You will have only three minutes, but t here will be no changeover time and no questions, so you should be able to get your message acro ss so the audience will know if they want to learn more and visit your display during the interactive session. Use the time wisely! Questions and discussions will happen during the interactive sessions. Rules 1. You must finish in three (3) minutes! Plan on 2:50 to be safe. After three minutes, your microphone will go dead and your lapt op will no longer be projected, and you will get the figurat ive (maybe literal) hook! 502. Your talk will be video-recorded. Suggestions 1. PRACTICE! This is a new format for many of us, and you will need to practice a number of times to get your message across effectively in only three minutes. 2. You will not be introduced. Give your name and the ti tle of your paper. 3. Your presentation is an advertisement for your paper, so focus on insights rather than details. 4. Avoid spending too much time on related work. 5. Consider giving an application/motivation of your work, the main result, and one piece of technical \"meat\" (e.g., a theorem, a design principle, an equation, etc.) that will help the audienc e understand the methodology and the depth of the work, understanding that there will not be time for all the details. The Interactive Session After your speaking session, in the next sessi on you will move to the Interactive Salons, where attendees can ask you questions and engage in discussion in an 80-minute interactive session. You will have a 42\" LED 1920x1080 display to project your laptop (VGA connection provided). There will also be a fixed sign with the title and authors of your paper so attendees can find you easily. Guidelines 1. If you have more than one author for your paper, we recommend you have two authors at your interactive station. This allows one author to walk around and talk to other authors of thematically-relat ed papers while the se cond author presents the work. 2. If there are people waiting to talk to you, limit your discussion with any one attendee. Schedule a time later to get together to discuss in more detail. 3. You should have several slides prepared t hat get into the det ails, but do not plan to give full 15-minute one-way talks. The format of the interactive session should encourage lively discussions between paper authors and audience members. The format of the interactive session is not to repeat the same 15-min one-way talk over and over until the end of MoA2 MoA3 Mani pulation and Gras ping & Localization and Ma pping I & Bioins pired Robots I & Robust and O ptimal Control Motion and Path Plannin g I Multi-Robot Coordination Chair Khatib, Oussama (Stanford University) Oriolo, Giuseppe (Sapienza University of Rome) Gini, Maria (University of Minnesota) # Time Session Ke ynote Session Ke ynote Session Ke ynote Keynote: What is pired Multi-modal Fl Mason, Carne gie Mellon Universit y MIT EPFL Mani pulation and Gras ping I Localization and Ma pping I Bioins pired Robots I Robotic Mani pulation in Ob ject Com position S pace Minin g Visual Phrases for Lon g-Term Visual SLAMModeling of Underwater Snake Robots Moving in a Vertical Plane in 3D Tactile Proximit y SensorsTowards Indoor Localization Using Visible Light Communication for Consumer Electronic DevicesActuation Strategy Differential Gear S ystemNetwork Localization from Relative Bearing MeasurementsNew Rolling and Stephen Artificial Hand with Stiffness Ad juster2D-3D Camera Fusion for Visual Odometry in Outdoor EnvironmentsiSplash-MICRO: A 50mm Robotic Fish Generating the Maximum Velocit y and Implementation of a Low-Cost and Lightwei ght Inflatable Robot Fin gerPosition Control of a Robot End-Effector Based on Synthetic A perture Wireless LocalizationMamba - A Waterproof Snake Robot with Tactile Sensin g for Aerial Manipulation: Actuator Number and Routin g for Gras ping and Perchin gStatic forces weighted Jacobian motion models for improved Odometr yMulti-Arm Robotic Swimming with Octopus-Inspired Com Free Control of Robotic Manipulators with Prescribed Transient and Steady State PerformanceVisual Localization within LIDAR Maps for Automated Urban Drivin g ReBiS - Interaction TrajectoriesDecentralized Cooperative Trajectory Estimation for Autonomous Underwater VehiclesRole of Compliant Leg in Sunpill; Cho, Kyu-Jin Quasi-Static Manipulation of a Planar Elastic Rod Using Multi ple Robotic Gri ppersVision Based Robot Localization by Ground to Satellite Matchin g in GPS-Denied SituationsOptimal Dynamic Force Mapping \u00d8yvind; Gravdahl, Jan Tommy Garment Perception and its Folding Using a Dual-arm RobotHybridization of Monte Carlo and Set-Membership Methods for the Global Localization of Underwater RobotsEmpirical Investigation Red Lac quer Room MoA1 MoA2 MoA3 # Time Robust and O ptimal Control Motion and Path Plannin g I Multi-Robot Coordination Numerical Approximation for Visibility Based Pursuit Evasion GameA Novel RRT Extend Function for Efficient and Smooth Mobile Robot Motion Plannin gReactive Switching Protocols for Active Target Trackin g and LocalizationGuiding Sampling-Based Tree Search for Motion Planning with Dynamics Via Probabilistic Roadmap AbstractionsCorrelated Orienteering Problem and Its Application to Informative Path Planning for Persistent Monitoring Tasks Wei, Hongchuan; Lu, Wenjie; DistributionsPlanning Agile Motions for Quadrotors in Constrained EnvironmentsCooperative Control of a Heterogeneous Multi-Robot System based on Relative of an object usin g dynamic visual servoin gOptimal Navigation Functions for Nonlinear VehiclesFinding Optimal Routes for Multi-Robot Patrolling in Generic Wei, Hongchuan; Lu, Pingping; Vehicle Tether Disturbances Analysis and Tar get Trackin g Control Multi-Cost Robotic Motion Plannin g under Uncertaint yFleet Size of Multi-Robot Systems for Exploration of Structured Environments Huang, hai; sheng, ming-wei; Li, Phase and Task Space Adaptation for Robust Motion ExecutionConstrained Path Optimization with Bezier Curve PrimitivesStable Formation of Groups of Robots Via and Consensus a Robot Network on an Underactuated D ynamic PlatformDistance 2013 Drop-In Player Experiments in Peter Robust Fixed Point Transformation Based Design for Model Reference Adaptive Control of a Modified TORA SystemState Lattice with Controllers: Augmenting Lattice- Based Path Planning with Controller-Based Motion PrimitivesAligning Coordinate Frames in Multi-Robot Systems with Horizon Optimization of Robot Motions Generated b y Hierarchical Movement PrimitivesSponsor Talk: Motion Planning for Collaborative RobotsA Mathematical Programming 20 2113 14 15 16 17 19 55Grand Ballroom State Ballroom Red Lac quer Room MoB1 MoB2 Calibration Kinematics and Mechanism Desi gn I Robot Learnin g I Visual Servoin g Chair Maciejewski, Anthony A.

Different arm sculling patterns produce different forward swimming gaits. A dynamical model, which considers arm and web compliance, was used to study the effect of the sculling parameters on forward swimming propulsion. An 8-arm compliant robotic swimmer was used to generate the swimming gaits, and evaluate this novel mode of propulsion. Speeds of 0.5 body lengths per second and propulsive forces of up to 10.5 N were achieved, with a cost of transport as low as 0.62. Multi-arm Robotic Swimming with Octopus-inspired Compliant Web M.

They can be used to generate constraint satisfying samples for problems including complicated linkage robots (e.g. closed chains and graspers). /g122We show that reachable volumes have an O(1) complexity in unconstrained systems and in many constrained systems. We also show that reachable volume can be computed in linear time and that reachable volume samples can be generated in linear time in problems without constraints. /g122We evaluate the reachable volume sampler over a wide variety of systems including linkages, closed chains and tree-like robots with as many as 262 dof.
