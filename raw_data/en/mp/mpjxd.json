Yellow Fever Vaccinations The Mount Sinai Travel Medicine Program is a designated Yellow Fever Center and offers official yellow fever vaccine certificates to both adults and children. As an academic center for travel medicine, Mount Sinai serves as a referral center for patients working for the United Nations and Doctors Without Borders. According to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov) (CDC), the yellow fever vaccine is recommended for people aged 9 months or older who are traveling to or living in areas at risk for yellow fever virus transmission in South America and Africa. Yellow fever vaccine may be required for entry into certain countries. Yellow fever vaccination requirements and recommendations for specific countries are available on the [CDC Travelers' Health page](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel). For most travelers, a single dose of yellow fever vaccine provides long-lasting protection, and a booster dose of the vaccine is not needed. However, some travelers may require a booster dose. Also, certain countries might require a booster dose of the vaccine; visit the [CDC Travelers' Health page](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel) for information on specific country requirements. We can help you to determine if you may need a dose of yellow fever vaccine or a booster dose before your trip to an area at risk for yellow fever. Fees Currently we send all bills for the travel medicine consultation and vaccinations to insurance companies. Different plans have different coverage policies. If the insurance company does not cover the services listed, the traveler will be responsible for the costs of the vaccines and the visit.
