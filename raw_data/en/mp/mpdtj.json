Weisberg, M.S. have been creating balance between body, mind and spirit for their patients since 1982. Their expertise in developing life programs that work for individuals and families have helped thousands to develop their own, strong and stealth immune systems without the use of vaccination. These immune systems are the strongest and medical science knows that as a fact. Once you are exposed to a virus and your immune system gains the innate knowledge of that virus you are immune for life. No boosters needed. Pretty smart, hey? What we need is to take back our trust in our innate intelligence but that will be difficult in our modern society where all of our food and water and air is suspect. We can do this and we must. Mankind's survival depends on our proper action. Your immunity is a function of who and what you are.
