It treats children, adolescents, adults and the elderly. We assess all patients and stabilize those in crisis.

Our staff helps patients plan for their discharge and make connections with the community. CRH also offers legal and pastoral services. [Special Services Information](/crh-special-services/download) Treatment at CRH Our treatment planning model follows six guiding principles: - Interdisciplinary; - Individualized to meet the patient's needs; - Problem and strength focused; - The patient is involved in the treatment planning process; - Driven by assessment data; and - The treatment plan is directed toward the patient's discharge. Through medication, counseling, educational sessions, group therapy, recreation therapy, work therapy, diet, creative expressive art and occupational therapy, we help patients learn how to achieve their discharge goals and better manage their illness. A team of psychiatrists, social workers, nurses and other trained professionals work together with the patient and family to develop a comprehensive treatment plan addressing individual and family needs.

We encourage all patients and families to actively participate in their treatment and recovery. Tobacco Use CRH is a tobacco free facility. There is no smoking or tobacco use allowed anywhere on campus by patients, staff, or visitors. Smoking cessation programs and products are available to patients. Cost and Financial Arrangements CRH is a state operated, non-profit institution. The charge for care and treatment is based upon the actual cost to the hospital. However, many patients and their families cannot pay the full amount of this cost. Therefore the Reimbursement Office will discuss the financial situation with the patient and family and arrive at an agreed upon payment for the hospital stay. The hospital is certified as a participating hospital by Medicare and Medicaid and most other insurance companies also will pay for hospitalization here. The Reimbursement Office will file any insurance claims. If patients cannot give the Reimbursement Office permission to file a claim with their insurance carrier, the person who is legally responsible will be required to pay the full charge. The Reimbursement Office is open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday except legal state holidays. The telephone number is 919-764-7650.
