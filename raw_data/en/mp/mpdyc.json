With the intention to bring the ancient natural beauty rituals of Ayurveda to today's modern woman, the heart of Bakuchiol Nava Age-defying Face Gel is the key ingredient of Bakuchiol - a retinol alternative and youth-preserving botanical plucked from the farthest reaches of the Himalayas. Known in Ayurveda as the \"Miracle Elixir\", Aroha Oils modernized this ancient elixir to conjure a nourishing, all-natural gel that minimizes fine lines while restoring the skin's healthy, youthful glow. After a month of use, wrinkles and expression lines are noticeably blurred, returning a fresh and youthful appearance to the face. \"Legend tells us of Queens sourcing Bakuchiol from the Himalayan valley to create a magical potion for their beauty rituals, and we want to help today's modern woman access this same magnificent experience,\" said Vivek Agarwal, CEO and Co-Founder of Aroha Oils. Bakuchiol Face Gel is the company's first daily facial moisturizer. Crafted to intensely moisturize and plump skin while defending against UV and blue light damage, the moisturizer is especially effective for sensitive and acne prone-skin. The moisturizer is available at the Aroha Oils [online store](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3329812-1&h=1928738579&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aroha-oils.com%2Fcollections%2Fbest-sellers&a=online+store), and online retailers Verishop and Beautyologie.
