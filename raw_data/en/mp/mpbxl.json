Hormones are the chemical messengers that affect your mental, physical, and emotional health. They are your body's chemical messengers, traveling to tissues or organs in your bloodstream. [Hormones](https://medlineplus.gov/hormones.html) work overtime and affect several different processes throughout the body, including growth and development, metabolism, sexual function, mood, and more. Typically, the body produces a precise amount of each hormone needed for various processes to stay healthy. Contact our obgyn in Lake Success for help with hormone balancing. Hormones are produced from the endocrine glands in the body. Some major [endocrine](https://www.news-medical.net/health/What-are-Hormones.aspx) glands in the body are the pituitary gland, pineal gland, thymus, thyroid, adrenal glands, pancreas, testes, and ovaries. These different organs produce microscopic amounts, taking only a very small amount to bring significant changes in the body. A small excess or deficiency of hormone production can lead to serious changes throughout the body. A hormone imbalance occurs when there is too much or too little of a certain hormone in the body.

Found women for women during my final and fourth pregnancy. I have had the best care and pregnancy due to this practice of super smart and personable doctors. I can't say enough how smart and caring they are. I had the pleasure of working with Dr.Scott-Ram, Smizer & Hirshhorn. My C Section went wonderfully & I believe it was all due to their care. Thank you so much Women for Women! - Justine R. Dr. Hirschhorn delivered our kids via caesarian section and we had a great experience. She explained everything to us adequately and made us feel very comfortable. We saw Dr. Smizer a few times in the office, too. We really recommend her, as well. They both took their time with us and were very friendly. Wait times were longer (sometimes more than 1 hour) with Dr. Smizer, but it was worth it by the end. The office staff is courteous, as well. Yes, spouses do need to be vaccinated for COVID-19 in order to accompany pregnant women for the visit, and the receptionists do check. It's not a big deal. Don't know why so many people are complaining in other reviews about this. Likely due to poor health and science literacy. Seriously people, get vaccinated! - Jaideep K. I had a great experience with all the doctors and staff at this facility. I was always treated with respect and courtesy. With the exception of one visit my wait time was always kept at a minimum. If I had an emergency and contacted the emergency line there was always a doctor to talk to. Unfortunately my plans for a vaginal delivery was thwarted and I had to get a Csection after an induction but I have no complaints....Dr. Bell did an amazing job and I am eternally grateful to her for delivering our baby girl. - Natoya F. I had a great first visit! I was definitely anxious about going to a new OBGYN, but the doctor and staff put me at ease right away. The front desk and medical assistant were especially nice and accommodating. Dr. Sanders was very friendly and professional, I really appreciated meeting in her office to go over my medical history before the exam. Overall I had an excellent visit and am excited to come in again. - Jessica W. "}
