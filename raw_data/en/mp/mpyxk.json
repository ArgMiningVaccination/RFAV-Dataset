Though wind and solar power are promising clean alternatives to fossil fuels, their natural unpredictability and intermittency prohibit them from comprising more than ~20% of grid power. Low cost technologies are needed to store renewable energy at grid-scale on time-scales of 1 to 24 hours. Flexible, large-scale energy storage would create a stronger and more robust electric grid by enabling renewables to contribute to reliable power generation. According to the International Energy Agency, the world needs to reduce to the use of fossil fuels in primary energy demand to one half while tripling the share of low-carbon sources to eliminate 70% of global CO 2 emissions from the energy sector by 2050. Greater deployment of renewable wind and solar power for electricity generation would contribute to a dramatic decline in total CO 2 emissions. Storing 20% of the energy generated by renewables allows the use of renewables for base load generation and further displacement of traditional CO 2 emitting electricity generation. This contributes to an additional reduction of 0.4 G Tons of CO 2 per year [1,2,3]. There is a need for low-cost energy storage technology with a low environmental impact. The CUNY-EI has invented rechargeable Zn-MnO 2 batteries [4,5,6,7]. Urban Electric Power is building and commercializing these batteries from its New York based manufacturing facility. The batteries can be produced at cost lower than lead acid and lithium-ion batteries of comparable grid-scale performance. Zn and MnO 2 make up a small fraction of the cost per unit of storage capacity compared with costly or environmentally less green cobalt, nickel, lithium and lead used in the other batteries. Moreover, these batteries offer a new level of inherent safety and environmental friendliness as they contain none of the flammable, toxic, or volatile electrolytes that have plagued other batteries considered for grid-scale storage. UEP's batteries will store electricity for power and capacity assurance, enabling widespread deployment of renewable, but intermittent, energy generation as well as power backup during outages, especially for regions with unreliable grids. The reason the batteries are low cost is that the Zn-MnO 2 batteries uses materials that are inexpensive, non-toxic, and widely deployed with well-established supply chains. For example, they are used in the non-rechargeable zinc-manganese dioxide AAA, AA, C and D batteries for toys, remote controls and flashlights. These batteries only use a single discharge of about half the full (two-electron) capacity of the manganese dioxide cathodes. The full capacity is about 600mAh/g of MnO 2 . For Zn the full capacity is about 800mAh/g, so Zn-MnO 2 batteries are intrinsically of very high energy density, as well as of low cost. Such non-rechargeable Zn-MnO 2 batteries retail for about $25/kWh and are manufactured at a cost of about $18/kWh. Typically lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries retail at higher prices, over $100 /kWh for lead acid batteries and around $150/kWh for lithium-ion batteries. To this end, DOE has supported a program at the City University of New York (CUNY) since 2010 that culminated in a scientific breakthrough [4], which enables very high depth-of-cycling (i.e., cycling at the full two-electron capacity of each manganese dioxide molecule) for thousands of charge/discharge cycles. Certain environmentally benign dopants are added to the MnO 2 that stabilize the battery cathode crystal structure and block the formation of inactive species. These rechargeable batteries will cost more than the $18/kWh of primary alkaline batteries when the cost of these additional components is considered though UEP expects to produce them <$50/kWh when produced in high volume, which makes them a highly attractive grid-scale technology. With regard to environmental impact, previous Zn-MnO 2 technologies have greenhouse gas emissions comparable tolead-acid and nickel-zinc [7]. When Zn-MnO 2 batteries are cycled at the high depth-of-discharge discovered by CUNY, however, they have a much lower CO 2 footprint when compared to other rechargeable batteries. The life cycle CO 2 emission by Zn-MnO 2 batteries (~28 kg CO 2 /kWh battery capacity) is 4X lower than the footprint of Li-ion batteries and very comparable to that of Lead acid [7,8]. However, the low CO 2 footprint of Lead Acid is made possible by the fact that lead is 99% recycled. Unfortunately, lead has to be smelted to be recycled and the process has a significant environmental impact that is making it impractical to site more smelting plants near the areas where the batteries are being used. In contrast, Zn and MnO 2 can be recycled by low energy consuming chemical processes allowing the Zn-MnO 2 battery to further reduce its manufacturing GHE footprint. Currently, UEP's pilot manufacturing facility produces about 1,000 cells per day with long-cycle capacity of 100Wh per cell. The product from the pilot is being used to obtain certifications (e.g., U.L. and FDNY), for market and price validation, and to advance collaborations with a major U.S. partner. The batteries have been deployed for resilience applications in the US and in India with system ranging from 2kWh to 50kWh, and for grid-scale and microgrid applications with systems ranging from 100kWh to 800kWh. UEP and the City University of New York are in the process of receiving final UL certification and FDNY approval to install an 800kWh/200kW grid-tied system in the Engineering Building of The City College of New York.
