Are you really bothered about how to boost immune system naturally? You can easily do so by a guided [third eye meditation followed by crown chakra meditation](https://7chakras.org/chakra-meditation/) in the most naturally effective way. I can almost bet that you might be hearing this for the first time in your life. It's not folklore at all. When it comes to boost immunity naturally, people generally associate it with their food intake. Folklore suggests you to boost immunity with food. There is a plethora of advice that it bombards you with, including... - Essential oil to boost immunity - Vitamins to boost immunity - Supplements to boost immunity - Tea to boost immunity - Herbs to boost immunity - Best foods to boost immunity - Fruits to boost immunity Sounds familiar? That is what you have been listening to ever since you came to awareness. I don't say these are not the good things to consume but taking them as a magic wand is wrong. They will never be able to boost immunity quickly. Foods that boost immunity never do it fast even if they do it at all. They might even never be able to boost immunity at all in case your digestive system is at fault. How to Boost Immune System Naturally with Guided Chakra Meditation for Immunity So, what is it that will build immunity fast and even take care of your faulty digestive system along? You guessed it right if you asked if it was third eye and crown chakra meditation. In fact, you need not take third eye and crown chakra meditation as esoteric and vague spiritual practices here. They are not! Rather they are simple and concrete biological procedures that anyone can follow in a few seconds. What they achieve is the [central fixation of the eye (Chapter XI - Central Fixation)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/free-pdf-books/bates-pswg-text.pdf) along with the central fixation of the mind. And you can certainly take the central fixation as the magic wand that answers how to boost immunity system naturally with guided meditation for immunity. You may ask why I mentioned the central fixation of the eye along with the central fixation of the mind. Eyes Are the Real Windows to the Mind It is because eyes are the real windows to the mind. So much so that they almost claim to be a virtual part of the mind! In fact 80% of our perception that we have of the world around is through eyes alone. Also anatomically they are located nearest to the brain separated just by the optic nerve attached to it. Mind is the interface between the brain and the body. The eyes rightly claim to be a virtual part of the mind! If we fix the eyes right, we will have fixed our mind right too. Mind over Matter As mind gets fixed, body follows suit. You must have heard the phrase 'mind over matter'. If mind is in the right mode, the body cannot afford to be in the wrong including its immune system! It is because they both are the two sides of the same coin. Now, what do we mean by the mind being in the right mode? We can frame theories around the right state of the mind. But they are prone to be as wrong as we pathetically live life from birth to death on this planet. So, how do we ascertain what right is? Theories that we have created around the right and the wrong of what we do are pathetically at fault. And they are not only at fault; they are chaotically vague as well. Body is way more intelligent and concrete than the mind is. Hence mind must listen to the body when it comes to testing its theories about values and boosting immunity. How can it do so even if it kills its megalomania and turns humble enough to listen to the body? The eyes come to the rescue of such a receptive mind then. That is why and how central fixation of the eye and central fixation of the mind are almost synonyms. Central Fixation of the Eyes & Central Fixation of the Mind Central fixation of the eyes means the central fixation of the mind. And when it happens, the eyes see right whether near or far. They don't need the crutches of the lenses or LASIK to do so. When the eyes see right, the mind thinks right too. Immunity builds up as fast as anything on earth could. A Hundred Year Old Quote by Dr. W H Bates I would like to quote an ophthalmologist Dr. W H Bates who said so exactly a hundred years ago: \"Not only do all errors of refraction and all functional disturbances of the eye disappear when it sees by central fixation, but many organic conditions are relieved or cured. I am unable to set any limits to its possibilities. I would not have ventured to predict that glaucoma, incipient cataract and syphilitic iritis could be cured by central fixation; but it is a fact that these conditions have disappeared when central fixation was attained. Relief was often obtained in a few minutes, and, in rare cases, this relief was permanent.\" \"Usually, however, a permanent cure required more prolonged treatment. Inflammatory conditions of all kinds, including inflammation of the cornea, iris, conjunctiva, the various coats of the eyeball and even the optic nerve itself, have been benefited by central fixation after other methods had failed. Infections, as well as diseases caused by protein poisoning and the poisons of typhoid fever, influenza, syphilis and gonorrhea, have also been benefited by it. Even with a foreign body in the eye there is no redness and no pain so long as central fixation is retained.\" More... \"Since central fixation is impossible without mental control, central fixation of the eye means central fixation of the mind. It means, therefore, health in all parts of the body, for all the operations of the physical mechanism depend upon the mind. Not only the sight, but all the other senses\u2014touch, taste, hearing and smell\u2014are benefited by central fixation. All the vital processes\u2014digestion, assimilation, elimination, etc.\u2014are improved by it. The symptoms of functional and organic diseases arc relieved. The efficiency of the mind is enormously increased. The benefits of central fixation already observed are, in short, so great that the subject merits further investigation.\" Courtesy: [The Cure of Imperfect Sight by Treatment without Glasses (https://s3.amazonaws.com/free-pdf-books/bates-pswg-text.pdf)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/free-pdf-books/bates-pswg-text.pdf) Turning Heels over Head There is good news here. A hundred years ago, Dr. Bates said... \"Since central fixation is impossible without mental control, central fixation of the eye means central fixation of the mind,\" Today, after a hundred years, based on my intensive research into it I am able to say... \"Since central fixation is impossible without biological control, central fixation of the mind means central fixation of the eye,\" Central fixation of the eye is achieved by third eye and crown chakra meditation done biologically in a concrete manner. There is no scope for any vague ideation in the process as it improves eyesight instantly. There can be no better proof of its correctness. Once you achieve central fixation of the eye and turn it into a habit, central fixation of the mind follows suit. Not only is the eyesight improved considerably, the mind intuitively learns how to boost immune system naturally by third eye & crown chakra meditation. A Caveat I need to say one more thing very clearly here about people not afflicted with myopia in their eyes. Young people below age 40 who believe their eyesight is perfect as they don't need lenses are at mistake. Their eyesight already has the seeds of presbyopia they are going to fall victim to in their 40s. It's only that the lenses in their eyes are helping them to see right before they turn hard in their 40s. After that they stop helping them seeing right although they kept seeing the wrong way through their eyes all along. In their 40s they develop problem in seeing near as opposed to a myopic having a problem in seeing far. They need to take support of the same crutches to read near in their old age. Practically no one barring few insightful individuals sees by central fixation of the eye. Hence practically no one barring few insightful individuals lives life with central fixation of the mind. No wonder why and how it has taken its toll on the human immune system!
