PMS, or Premenstrual syndrome, is the name for the symptoms women experience before their period. It wreaks havoc on your hormones and can turn even the most peaceful of people into a moody monster. Fortunately, there are natural remedies for PMS that can help you keep your cool. How PMS affects mood In our research, we found that 90% of women experience changes in their moods and emotions during their cycles. This might not come as a surprise to you if you've ever cried over a rom-com or eaten a whole tub of ice cream when it's your time of the month, but what is happening to your body to have this effect?

And that, ladies, is why you're crying at Bridget Jones' Diary again.

The National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) suggests lifestyle modifications, such as aerobic exercise 20-30 minutes, 3 times a week, and balanced meals for management of mild to severe PMS with other medications.
