Reiki, meaning \"sunlight energy\" in its translation, is a Japanese spiritual healing therapy. Like [acupuncture](/services/integrative-medicine/center-for-integrative-medicine/acupuncture), [cupping](/services/integrative-medicine/center-for-integrative-medicine/cupping) and [gua sha](/services/integrative-medicine/center-for-integrative-medicine/gua-sha), reiki unblocks qi (pronounced \"chee\"), a Chinese philosophy of energy medicine that regulates spiritual, emotional, mental and physical balance. Reiki uses this energy flow to promote relaxation, ease stress and tension, and connect people with their own healing energy. Reiki is not a massage, nor is it affiliated with any religious practice or based on a belief system. Rather, it is a practice of guiding energy to promote healing and the free flow of energy throughout the body. This integrative therapy is meant to bring balance to the entire body instead of focusing on one specific condition, although it is often used to decrease stress and anxiety in patients and their loved ones and can be performed in hospital rooms and waiting rooms. Reiki is also beneficial for all stages of pregnancy including conception and childbirth, and works on both the mother and the child. During your reiki session, you will lie fully clothed on a massage table while the energy flow from the reiki master's hands is transferred into your body and energy field. The master can perform reiki by either using a light touch or simply holding their hands slightly above your body. The master will guide you through breathing techniques while moving through various hand positions, maintaining each for a duration of 30 seconds to over a minute, above the body to promote energy flow. Some patients describe feeling in a dream-like state, a warm, tingling sensation or just an overall sense of calm and relaxation. Depending on your wellness goals, how often you have reiki treatment will vary. Many patients come for treatment on a regular basis, similar to a massage.
