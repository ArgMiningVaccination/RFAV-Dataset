Production of mRNA vaccines results in several nucleic acid and enzymatic by-products, most of which can be detected and removed; however, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) contaminants pose a particular challenge. Current purification and detection platforms for dsRNA vary in effectiveness, with problems in scalability for mass mRNA vaccine production. Effectively detecting dsRNA is crucial in ensuring the safety and efficacy of the vaccines, as these strands can cause autoimmune reactions with length-symptom dependency and enhance mRNA degradation. We present a new microfluidics method to rapidly identify and quantify dsRNA fragments in mRNA samples. Our innovation exploits the differences in the dynamic staining behavior between mRNA and dsRNA molecules to detect dsRNA contaminants in a high throughput approach. The limit of detection of the system for dsRNA was estimated to be between 17.7-76.6 pg L1 with a maximum loading capacity of mRNA of 12.99 ng L1. Based on these estimated values, our method allows for the detection of dsRNA contaminants present in percentages as low as 0.14-0.59% compared to the total mRNA concentration. Here, we discuss the molecular mechanism of the dynamic staining behavior of dsRNA and mRNA for two different stains. We believe our method will accelerate the mRNA vaccine development from initial development to quality control workflows. - This article is part of the themed "}
