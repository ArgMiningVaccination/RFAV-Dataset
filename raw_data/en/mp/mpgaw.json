I had heard a great dealabout this film and became convinced even more that thiswas a \"must-see.\" I, too, use awheelchair; many of the experi-ences portrayed seemed to havemirrored my own quite closely. I was especially intrigued that Dr. Berland chose subjectswho were not \"down and out,\"but rather were people who had had and continue to haveenriching lives.

Section Chief, Pediatric Radiology Yale-New Haven Hospital First among surgeons, last in the spotlight I noted the letter in the Summer 2004 issue of Yale Medicine about Max Taffel. I was a resident in surgery at Yale from 1960through 1966, and during thatperiod had an occasion to visitMax Taffel at his home oneevening along with several of myresident colleagues. Although herarely discussed his past, we didhear a bit of his World War IIexperiences while at One Tree Hillin New Zealand performing sur-gery for injured soldiers from theSouth Pacific campaigns. Mostof the evening's discussion wasabout various surgical subjects. At one point I walked past a small room that contained a desk, books, lots of papers strewnhere and there and a few framedthings on its walls. One of theframed objects was a certificatefrom the American Board ofSurgery. Looking closer, I saw thatit was certificate No. 1!

We asked Sally Provence of the Child Study Center to seehim. She made the diagnosis ofautism. Since his parents werebusy with three other childrenand their work, etc., Sally sug-gested he live with his grandpar-ents for a year. They were retiredand could give him their fullattention. Within the year theboy was relating to others andtalking. Today he lives alone andholds a responsible technical job that requires some contactwith others. Naturally the family gives full credit to Dr. Provence for this success. She deserves recognition for her insight intothe psychological problems of children. Ira Gabrielson, m.d., hs '53 Drexel University College of MedicinePhiladelphia, Pa.us that four young surgeons journeyed to Philadelphia in 1937to take the very first AmericanBoard of Surgery examination. Dr. Taffel was awarded the first certificate. After completing thetwo-year chief residency in 1966,I was certified by the AmericanBoard of Surgery in 1967 and wasawarded certificate No. 14899 (aless auspicious number than Dr.Taffel's, but I was pleased!). I feelcertain that none of us wouldhave heard about this from Dr.Taffel had I not stumbled on thecertificate. I knew him to be ahumble man, a dedicated teacherand a meticulous surgeon, and itseems fitting that he was the firstto pass the American Board ofSurgery examination. A. Griswold Bevin, m.d .

'57 New Britain, Conn. 3 Waiting it out in Haiti At this writing at the end of September, Haiti has just endured another storm and 10 days of devastation following HurricaneJeanne. Fifteen hundred people have died in the floodingand mudslides that swept the coastal region near Gona\u00efves,the country's second-largest city. Today's Miami Herald tells the deeply unsettling story of a mother who was forced tochoose between rescuing her 6-year-old son and holding onto her 4-year-old daughter as she struggled to escape the rising flood waters. Now she is worrying about the child whosurvived. Will enough food arrive to keep the girl nourished?Will cholera and other diseases spare her? Public health in Haiti and the impoverished country's long history of suffering are at the heart of this issue's cover story (\" A Film to Finish,\" page 18) by alumna AmeliaShaw, m.p.h. '03. Shaw had to leave Haiti during an earlier moment of tumult this year\u2014the riots preceding the ousterof President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in February\u2014but shereturned in July to continue work on the documentary lmshe is making about the impact of aids in Haiti. Two months later, she was waiting out a different kind of stormand glad to be back, despite the element of danger. As herHaitian colleague Liony Accelus says, \"Our lm is reallygoing to change the way Haitians think about treating aids .\" As you will read, they risked their lives to make it. Managing Editor John Curtis happened upon Shaw's story last winter during a conversation with faculty memberKaveh Khoshnood, m.p.h. '89 , ph.d. '95, and has been in contact with her ever since. With the article written and laidout, we listened to the hurricane reports from Port-au-Princein September and noted one voice with special interest. Shaw, who had worked as a summer intern at National PublicRadio, was now covering the hurricane's aftermath for npr. In an e-mail in late September, she reported that the peoplein her story\u2014Accelus, Moliere Jean and Uncle Big\u2014all sur-vived the storms . Shaw's article shows one way in which Yale has an impact on the world of health and medicine. We're impressedby her reporting and writing and proud to have her byline in Yale Medicine . The best epilogue to her story would be a healthier Haiti. September's news also brought a happy footnote to another celluloid story. Gretchen K. Berland, m.d. , an assist- ant professor of medicine who is also a documentary lm-maker, was awarded a $500,000 \"genius grant\" from theJohn D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. The ve-year, no-strings-attached fellowship will support her work onprojects similar to Rolling , in which she provided cameras to three people who use wheelchairs and created a compellingportrait of their everyday lives. Rolling was the subject of a feature article (\"Life on Wheels\") in the Summer 2004 issueof Yale Medicine . Michael Fitzsousa michael.tzsousa@yale.edufrom the editor SECOND OPINION BY SIDNEY HARRIS 4 chronicle news from cedar streetyale medicine fall/win ter 200 4New travel restrictions bar Cuba rotations A program that allowed Yale residents to observe the island nation's healthcare system ends. For each of the past four years, up to four residents at Yale-New HavenHospital have spent six weeks studyinghealth care in Cuba. Those rotations are unlike other foreign rotations thattake residents to more than a dozencountries, said Michele Barry, m.d., hs '77, co-director of the Yale/Johnson & Johnson Physician Scholars in Inter-national Health program, which sends40 Yale residents abroad each year. \"It's a little bit different than our other rotations in underserved areas,where they desperately need doctors,\"Barry said. Cuba has no shortage ofphysicians and Barry sends residentsto Cuba, she said, to observe the Cubanapproach to primary care. \"They have a physician assigned to an entireneighborhood. The physician takesownership of the neighborhood'shealth and does outreach in a way that we have never been very effectiveat,\" Barry said. That exposure to Cuban health care practices is no longer possible becauseof new restrictions on travel to Cubathat the U.S. Department of the Treasuryput into effect on June 30. Among otherlimits on travel by American citizens,students must stay in Cuba for at least10 weeks, too long for hospital resi-dents, Barry said. The rotations in Cuba were organ- ized through Medical Education Cooper-ation with Cuba ( medicc ), a nonprot organization that has sent almost 900students from more than 100 medical, nursing and public health schools toCuba since 1997. \"These regulationswill make it very difcult for health sci-ences students to study in Cuba, sincemost academic institutions do not havethe resources to organize a course of 10weeks,\" said medicc 's director, Diane Appelbaum, r.n., m.s. The new guidelines, she said, restrict medicc in several ways. For one, it's not an academic institution, the onlyentity now allowed to send faculty,staff or students to Cuba. The newguidelines also require that studentswishing to study in Cuba must do soas part of accredited courses in theinstitution in which they are enrolled,rather than under the auspices ofother organizations or programs. Andthe courses medicc offers in Cuba only last between two and six weeks. For most of Fidel Castro's reign, which began in 1959, the United Stateshas restricted travel by U.S. citizens to Cuba. Typically only scholars, jour-nalists and Cuban-Americans with rela-tives on the island have been allowed to travel there. The latest restrictionsare based on recommendations by theCommission for Assistance to a FreeCuba, which President Bush createdlast fall to find ways to move Cubatoward democracy. The new rules donot affect graduate students pursuingindependent research. Barry sees a political motive for the new rules\u2014a desire to garner sup-port from conservative Cuban exilesin Florida in the presidential election.And she believes the restrictions arecounterproductive. \"I only see goodthings coming out of the exchange,\"Barry said. I do not think a countrylike the United States should fostercensorship and thus prevent anexchange of ideas and provost postfor presidency of mit When she embarked on her career as a neurobiologist in the early 1980s,Yale Provost Susan Hockeld, ph.d ., never imagined that her academic pathwould take her from running a labora-tory to running a university. She devotedherself to research, devising novel usesof monoclonal antibody technologyand discovering a gene that may play a role in brain cancer. \"Being a scien-tist is a wonderful, wonderful career,\"she said in September in her ofce on Hillhouse Avenue. \"I had no aspira-tions to move into positions of aca-demic leadership.\" But early on her administrative skills emerged. After she came to Yale in1985, she ran a summer program inneurobiology at the Cold Spring HarborLaboratory on Long Island, where shehad previously worked. At Yale, Hock-eld, the William Edward GilbertProfessor of Neurobiology, served asdirector of graduate studies in themedical school's Section of Neurobiologyand on the graduate school's executivecommittee. In 1998 she was nameddean of the Graduate School of Artsand Sciences (the rst member of themedical school faculty appointed to that post), and in January 2003, shebecame provost when her predecessor,Alison Richard, ph.d ., was chosen to lead Cambridge University. As provost she has worked to advance science, medicine and engineering at Yale\u2014initiatives that include a $500million investment in facilities. Shehas also fomented interdisciplinary col-laborations throughout university.In August the Insti- tute of Technology ( mit) announced that Hockeld would become its 16thpresident, the rst woman and the rstlife scientist so named. She will move to Cambridge, Mass., with her husband,Thomas N. Byrne Jr., m.d., hs '81 , clinical professor of neurology, neuro-surgery and medicine at the medicalschool, and their daughter, Elizabeth,13, in December. At mit she replaces Charles M. Vest, ph.d ., who announced his retirement last year after 14 years lead-ing the school. (In October, PresidentRichard C. Levin appointed DeputyProvost Andrew D. Hamilton, ph.d ., to succeed Hockeld.) \"mitis an inspiring place, populated by inspiring people,\" Hockeld said.\"From my first conversations in thesearch process, the centralthemes\u2014the pursuit of truth, integrityand the great meritocracy\u2014have reso-nated with my own core values.\" Although mit, with its strong reputation in engineering, has neverbefore named a biological scientist as its leader, Hockfield said that theschool's grants and contracts sup-porting research in the life sciences,largely from the National Institutes of Health, have grown at a remark-able rate over the last decade. And the school is constructing a three-building complex devoted to neuro-science. With its strengths inengineering, the physical sciencesand the biological sciences, shebelieves mit is well-positioned for collaborative, interdisciplinary science. \"I am hoping to do what Ican to encourage bridge-buildingamong these disciplines,\" she said. She also plans to continue the prac- tice of past mit presidents who have served as advocates for sound nationalpolicies on science, technology andhigher education. (The school main-tains an office in Washington, whichshe will visit once a month.) One ofher main concerns is that Americanstudents are falling behind their peersaround the world in math and science.She'd like to see improvement in mathand science education from kinder-garten through high school, to engageand inspire students. \" Almost everychild gets a thrill from building andinventing things that work,\" she said.\"Math and science in our schools can do a better job in tapping andencouraging that creative energy.\" For now, though, her attention is on mit. \"My overarching goal is to help mit to be an even greater mit,\" she said. \"I hope that mit is increas- ingly seen as among the very bestplaces in the world for people\u2014faculty,staff and students\u2014who are enor-mously inspired by innovation in bothteaching and research.\" \u2014J.C. Neurobiologist Susan Hockfield is leaving Yale after almost two decades to become the president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. don na c oveney/mit6 chronicleyale medicine fall/win ter 200 4Yale cme gets a new lease on lifelong learning as itadapts to the Internet age Nearly 25 years ago, when Continuing Medical Education ( cme) at Yale was created to develop programs that pres-ent the most current information andresearch to a broad range of medicalprofessionals, the practice of medicinewas very different. Advances in medi-cine did not occur at such a rapid pace,managed care had not permeated themedical landscape and 15-minute ofcevisits were not yet the norm. Today, as physicians try to keep up with their profession in a changedmedical environment, Yale cme is overhauling its continuing educationactivities, which include courses andconferences, regularly scheduled grandrounds and two newsletters ( The Medical Letter and Diabetes Newsletter ) that include tests on their content for cme credit. Its goal is to build cme at Yale into an educational clearinghousethat acts not only as a resource, but asthe facilitator of new information. \"One of the challenges in the envi- ronment is that physicians, because of managed care, nd it increasinglydifcult to leave the practice and go toa meeting,\" said Lawrence S. Cohen, m.d., hs '65, the Ebenezer K. Hunt Professor of Medicine, special advisorto the dean and chair of the cme Faculty Advisory Committee. In response, Yale cme is taking advantage of the Internet to streamline many ofits activities. A revamped website allowsparticipants to register for conferencesonline and access The Medical Letter and its corresponding exams at their convenience. (The Diabetes Newsletterwill be available online sometime next year). In addition, physicians will beable to take online courses and exami-nations for cme credit within the next few months. \"On a practical basis, we are formal- izing activities that have been ongoingat the School of Medicine, such asgrand rounds and tumor boards (whichmeet to discuss cancer cases), andmaking them easily accessible to cme for credit,\" said Cohen. \"Most impor- tantly, we are uncovering, not surpris-ingly, a wealth of investigators/educatorswho are in the process of puttingtogether programs appropriate for cme at Yale.\" A major issue is compliance with guidelines set by the AccreditationCouncil for Continuing Medical Educa-tion ( accme ), including standards for commercial support that outline thesteps that must be taken when accept-ing nancial support from sourcessuch as drug companies and devicemanufacturers. Two years ago the pro-gram 's accreditation was at risk overshortcomings in its record keeping andcompliance with accme rules. Then Mary D. Marcarelli became director of cme, which is now up-to-date onaccme standards and has trained almost 50 departmental coordinatorsto ensure compliance. In July the Yale cme program learned it received full accreditation from the accme through June 2008. Plans under consideration for the future include video coverage of grand rounds on the Web; a lectureseries focusing on research that can be directly translated to patient care;and the production of a cme program through the cable channel DiscoveryHealth to offer cme credit to those unable to travel to conferences. Thenext few years may also usher in the use of handheld personal digitalassistants to deliver cme course materials and the revival of the Mini-Med School Program, begun in 1995,which presented a series of lectures to the general public. cme at Yale has become a high- profile project, and will continue toevolve as new technologies, researchand treatments become available.\"Medicine moves forward,\" saidMarcarelli. \"We're moving with it.\" \u2014Jill Max Yale CME can be found online at cme.yale.edu/. james yang7 et cetera YALE JOINS DIABETES TRIAL The School of Medicine has joined 11 other medical centers in a national study that willcompare three treatments for type 2 dia-betes in children and teenagers. The study isthe first clinical trial to look at the impact ofintensive lifestyle change designed to lowerweight by cutting calories and increasingexercise. It is also the first trial sponsored by the National Institute of Diabetes andDigestive and Kidney Diseases to focus ontype 2 diabetes in youth. The five-year trial will look at how each treatment option, including drugs currentlyused in adults, controls blood glucose levelsin younger patients. It will also evaluatesafety and the effects of treatments oninsulin production, insulin resistance, bodycomposition, nutrition, physical fitness andrisk factors for disease. The principal investigator at Yale is Sonia Caprio, m.d ., associate professor of pediatrics (endocrinology). \u2014J.C. EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS FLAWED Soldiers engaged in survival training had trouble identifying people they encounteredduring threatening and stressful events,according to a Yale study published thisSpring in the International Journal of Law and Psychiatry . \"Contrary to the popular concept that most people would never forget the face of a clearly seen individual who had physi-cally confronted them and threatened themfor more than 30 minutes, a large number of subjects in this study were unable to correctly identify their perpetrator,\" saidCharles A. Morgan III, m.d ., associate clinical professor of psychiatry. Morgan studied more than 500 soldiers who were subjected to stress modeled after the experiences of prisoners of war. For48 hours prior to questioning, they weredeprived of food and sleep. Asked to identifytheir guard and interrogator a day later,those who experienced less stressful interro-gations had better recognition. \"The present data have a number of implications for law enforcement personnel,mental health professionals, physicians,attorneys and judges,\" Morgan said. \u2014J.C.A conservative \"hit list\" targets aids researchers, including some at Yale In the fall of 2003 Margaret R. Weeks, ph.d ., got a call from her project of- cer at the National Institute on DrugAbuse ( nida ). Weeks, an anthropolo- gist and the associate director of theInstitute for Community Research inHartford could hear the stress in herproject ofcer's voice. The NationalInstitutes of Health ( nih) needed an immediate report on her study thatrecruits drug users to spread a mes-sage about how to prevent hiv/aids . \"We were two and a half years into a four-year study. We didn 't have nd-ings,\" Weeks told the audience at aids Science Day in April, describing her response. She said, 'Give me anythingyou can.' \" Weeks and her project, which is afliated with the Center for Interdis-ciplinary Research on aids based at the School of Public Health, were onwhat came to be known as the \"hit list\"of about 200 federally funded studiesdeemed by the conservative TraditionalValues Coalition to be \"prurient,\"\"smarmy\" and having \"little or no bear-ing on public health.\" The list found its way to Congress, which demandedexplanations. Elias A. Zerhouni, m.d., director of the nih, looked into the studies and went back to Congress witha vigorous defense. The project Weeks is leading recruits active drug users and trains them tobecome peer health advocates who canintroduce harm reduction measuresinto drug use sites. Weeks was one offour panelists at aids Science Day to discuss the implications of this list. Michael H. Merson, m.d., dean of public health and moderator of thepanel, said the list made him thinkback to the 1950s and another politi-cian with a list. \" As someone who hashis name on this list, I immediatelyrecalled the words of Senator JosephMcCarthy,\" he said. Merson appearedon the list as principal investigator of studies on drug use in high-risk set- tings and aids in China. Panelist Judith Auerbach, vice presi- dent for public policy at the AmericanFoundation for aids Research (amfAR), placed the \"hit list\" in the context ofother assaults on science. She noted that the Union of Concerned Scientistsissued a report in February that citedexamples of what it called the adminis-tration 's distortion of science, and scoresof scientists, including 20 Nobel lau-reates, issued a statement accusing theadministration of misrepresenting scientic ndings. Studies on air pollution, mercury emissions, lead in water and globalwarming\u2014which affect key industrialconstituents of the Bush administra-tion\u2014have been questioned, Auerbachsaid. Religious views have dominateddiscussion of condom use, sex and thesale of contraceptives over the counter.\" All of this misuse or misinterpreta-tion of science is happening in a verypolitical context,\" Auerbach said. \"Thegoal of the attacks is to disallow certainkinds of research.\" \"Some of what is going on is not entirely new,\" said Kevin Cranston, m.div ., acting director of the hiv/aids bureau at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, \"even if in a matter of degree it is entirely unprecedented.\" Ana Oliveira, executive director of Gay Men 's Health Crisis in New York,said organizations in Washington andSan Francisco have undergone auditsof their grant funding. \"The kind ofthreat and intimidation an audit repre-sents is unbelievable. It diverts pre-cious time and resources.\" Indeed, Weeks said her entire ofce mobilized to gather information for the nih. \"Everyone stopped what they were doing and helped,\" she said. Apart fromthe waste of time and energy, Weekssaid, targeting individual projects andscientists has the effect of chilling stud-ies of controversial topics. \"We absolutelycannot use this as a reason to shy awayfrom this research,\" she said. \u2014John Curtis8 rounds medicine and health at yaleyale medicine fall/win ter 200 4investigators and nurses. The clini- cians report directly back to the labora-tory scientists, who incorporate ndingsinto planning for new research. The latest study uses the anticancer drug phenoxodiol to sensitize ovariancancer cells before chemotherapy.Phenoxodiol, developed in Australia forpossible use as a treatment for cancerand cardiovascular disease and as ananti-inflammatory, was among about200 compounds screened for their anti-cancer properties by Gil Mor, m.d., ph.d ., an associate professor of obstet- rics, gynecology and reproductive sciences, and his team. Phenoxodiolattacks a problem common in cancercells: normal cell death is blocked,allowing cells to proliferate and formtumors. The drug, which affects intracellular signaling, helps activatecaspases, the enzymes that regulatecell death. Mor said the intravenoustreatment renders the cancer cells upto 100 times more vulnerable to thechemotherapy drugs cisplatin andpaclitaxel. This sensitization allowsdoctors to prescribe lower doses ofchemotherapy, reducing the damageto healthy cells that can cause debili-tating side effects. \"Our new approach was not to develop new cytotoxic drugs but to find something specific that willremove those blockers [to cell death] in the cancer cell without affecting normal cells,\" said Mor. Mor is encouraged by how quickly discoveries about molecular pathwaysare being tested in patient trials. \" Allthese ndings are immediately broughtto the clinic,\" he said. \"This is quiteunusual. Findings in the lab can takeyears to get to the clinic.\" Once his group developed its therapy, Mor said, it took about eightmonths to gain approval from themedical school's institutional reviewboard, the Human Investigation Committee, and then recruit 40patient volunteers to take part in acombined Phase I/Phase II trial that tests both safety and effective-ness. Mor said the researchers savetime because lab investigators have immediate access to tissue samplesfrom cancer patients and a clinicalpopulation that allows them to launcha trial quickly. In one instance in1999, he noted, a basic science labwithout close ties to a clinic couldn 'tget an ovarian cancer drug into clinical trials until 2003.\"The time cut is years,\" said Mor's clinical colleague, Thomas J. Rutherford, ph.d., m.d., fw '94, associate profes- sor of obstetrics and gynecology.Rutherford said the researchers learnnot only from each other but also from others on the team, includingnurses, who have insights into man-aging clinical problems. \"If you're willing to talk and listen\u2014and I'd saylistening is most important\u2014there's a tremendous amount of informationpeople will give you.\" The Discovery to Cure program sponsors research on four gynecologi-cal cancers: ovarian, cervical, uterineand breast. Of these cancers, ovarian cancer poses a particularly daunting problem,because it is rarely discovered in itsearly stages. When diagnosed in theadvanced stages, the ve-year survivalrate ranges from 20 to 40 percent. Morand Rutherford are working to developa blood test to detect the cancer early,collaborating with Peter E. Schwartz, m.d., hs '70, the John Slade Ely Profes- sor of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Rutherford is optimistic. \"We have identied what we think to be proteinmarkers for early ovarian cancer,\" hesaid. \"If it proves to be true, it will be a good thing.\" \u2014Cathy ShufroQuickening the pace from bench to bedside A new program speeds laboratory findings into the clinic, cutting years from the process. Just eight months after scientists in a lab on Cedar Street devised a newapproach for treating ovarian cancer,clinical trials began in June at Yale'sgynecologic oncology clinic a blockaway on Howard Avenue. The experi-mental protocol is among four clinicaltrials under way in the Discovery toCure program\u2014an informal collabo-ration that began in the late 1990s andtook on its new name in June.

A newstudy by Yale researchers found that such adiet also increases the risk of non-Hodgkin'slymphoma ( nhl ), a cancer that attacks the lymphatic system. The study reaffirmed another mantra of dieticians and nutritionists\u2014consumption of high-fiber fruits and vegetables such asbroccoli, lettuce, tomatoes and cauliflower isassociated with a lower risk of nhl . \"An association between dietary intake and nhl is biologically plausible because diets high in protein and fat may lead toaltered immunity, resulting in increased risk of nhl ,\" said Tongzhang Zheng, sc.d., associate professor of epidemiology (envi- ronmental health). Zheng was the principalinvestigator of the study of Connecticutwomen, which was published in the Ameri- can Journal of Epidemiology earlier this year. \"The antioxidants found in vegetables andfruits may result in a reduced risk of about40 percent.\" \u2014J.C. HIGH VOLUME NOT ALWAYS BEST The conventional wisdom suggests that only hospitals that perform at least 400 angio-plasties a year should be allowed to offer theprocedure. A higher volume, the reasoninggoes, leads to better outcomes. But researchers at Yale and the University of Pennsylvania challenge that view in astudy published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology . The study of 362,748 angioplasties performed between1998 and found comparable outcomesin medium- to very-high-volume hospitals.Yet some low-volume hospitals providedexcellent care while some high-volume hos-pitals did not, said Saif S. Rathore, m.p.h. ,a lecturer in cardiovascular medicine, and oneof the study's authors. \"If you accept volume Rathore \"you essentially consignall low-volume hospitals of poorquality and you give all high-volume hospi-tals a pass on quality.

A laboratory-controlled study by Yalescientists published in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology last summer has found that delta-9-tetrahydro-cannabinol ( thc), the active ingredient of cannabis, transiently induced arange of schizophrenia-like effects inhealthy people. And the past year,three large epidemiological studieshave supported the long-suggestedlink between cannabis use and a riskof schizophrenia. \"No one really knew how cannabis worked until about 10 years ago,\" saidD. Cyril D'Souza, m.d., associate pro- fessor of psychiatry and lead author ofthe study. \"The discovery of cannabi-noid receptors and several otheradvances in the basic pharmacology of the cannabinoid receptor systemhave renewed interest in that associa-tion between cannabis and psychosis.\" Because animal models of psychosis have signicant limitations, scientistshave used drugs to induce transientpsychosis in humans. \"Perhaps bystudying drug-induced psychosis, thatmight lead us to a better psychoses in general and schizo-phrenia in particular,\" D'Souza said,adding that this is the rst study, to hisknowledge, that has applied measuresfor schizophrenia to study the effectsof thc in healthy people screened for any vulnerability to schizophrenia.In the study, thc induced tempo- rary responses similar to the threedomains of schizophrenia: positivesymptoms such as paranoia and disor-ganization of thinking, negative symptoms such as blunted affect andreduced spontaneity, and cognitivedecits such as memory lapses. Onthree test days at least a week apart, theresearchers administered thc to 22 test subjects\u2014including Yale medicalstudents and undergraduates and othervolunteers. All had used cannabis pre-viously but none had ever been diag-nosed with cannabis abuse disorder ora major psychiatric disorder. On eachtest day the subjects received one ofthree injections, a placebo or a low ormedium dose of thc, before taking a series of behavioral and cognitive tests. The subjects reported how they felt, using a scale of feeling states associated with cannabis effects\u2014high,calm, relaxed, tired, anxious and panicked. Some subjects experiencedschizophrenia-like symptoms lastingbetween half an hour and an hour. Inaddition, thc induced euphoria and raised levels of cortisol and prolactin,biological markers for activity ofcannabinoid receptors. The tests relied on self-reporting and the observations of trainedresearchers, which at times differedfrom those of the subjects. \"We had asubject who refused to complete someof the cognitive testing because shewas convinced we were trying to trickher,\" said D'Souza. \"But when we askedif she felt paranoid, she said 'no.' \" Follow-up months after the study revealed no side effects among participants. Ultimately, D'Souza said, the research may provide clues about thepathophysiology of psychotic disor-ders. \"By understanding how cannabisproduces psychosis, that may help usunderstand what goes wrong in schizo-phrenia,\" he said. \u2014John Curtis10 findings from the benchyale medicine fall/win ter 200 4In the kitchen, a way to treat cystic fibrosis? A spice may protect a mutant, but functional, protein from the cell'squality control system. A possible compound for the treatment of cystic brosis may be as close as thekitchen spice rack. Researchers at Yaleand the University of Toronto reportedrecently in Science that curcumin, an element of the spice turmeric, helpscorrect a protein defect associated withthis genetic disease. Through a mechanism that is not completely understood, curcumin protects a mutant, yet functional, pro-tein from the cell's quality controlmachinery. Cystic brosis maintaina balance of ions and water. When thatbalance disrupted, becomesa sludge that clogs respiratory anddigestive pathways, ultimately causinginfections. Most people with cysticbrosis do not live past the age of 30. The most common form of cystic brosis is called delta F508, and is dueto the deletion of a single amino acidfrom the sequence of cftr . Although the protein is still able to mitigate mostcystic brosis symptoms, cellular qual-ity control machinery tags it for degra-dation, because without the amino acidit cannot fold properly. \"Even though[it] works, it saidMichael J. '87, ph.d. '87, professor of cellular and molecularphysiology and cell biology and theprincipal investigator of the study. Working with Marie E. Egan, m.d. , associate professor of pediatrics andcellular and molecular physiology, and others, he may have found a wayto subvert quality control. As part of the quality control process, some chaperone proteins bind to cal-cium, commonly found in the endo-plasmic reticulum (ER). To help cftr evade quality control, Caplan and Egan sought compounds that would disablethe chaperones by depleting calciumstores in the ER. Previously identiedcompounds blocked calcium pumpaction in the ER, but proved to be toxic.A search through the literature turnedup curcumin, a weak inhibitor of ERcalcium pumps. Remarkably, it worked\u2014and well, at least in tissue culture and mousemodels. The researchers noted arestoration of ion transport in micethat received curcumin, and in celllines bathed in curcumin, a fraction of the mutated protein migrated to the cell membrane and restored a sig- nicant level of ion transport function. Given these findings, Egan and Caplan plan to collaborate with theCystic Fibrosis Foundation and SeerPharmaceuticals in a potency in cystic brosis. However, Eganstresses that more research is needed:\"What it does to people versus what itdoes in mice may be very different. Werst need to get a better handle on themechanism,\" Egan said. To that end,Egan and Caplan are trying to determinewhether curcumin blocks calcium pumpaction or whether it binds to cftr to help stabilize it. They are also investigat-ing whether the active compound is cur-cumin or a metabolite of curcumin. Ifthe data from both the clinical and basicresearch investigations prove its efcacy,curcumin may be the rst cystic brosisdrug that treats the cause of the diseaserather than just the symptoms. \u2014Kara Nyberg einat pe led11 et cetera Molecular players shown to affect nerve fibers in multiple sclerosis Until recently, researchers knew very little about the neural molecules associ-ated with secondary progressive multi-ple sclerosis (MS), a nerve-degeneratingautoimmune disease that afflicts almost3 million people worldwide. Scientistshad typically studied the disease inmouse models, but Stephen G. Waxman, ph.d ., m.d. , professor of neurology, pharmacology and neurobiology, hiscolleagues looked for clues at thesource\u2014postmortem spinal cord tissuefrom MS patients. In a study publishedin May in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , Waxman 's team and researchers from the VA ConnecticutHealthcare System in West Haven andUniversity College London described the rst observations in humans of key molecules that contribute to nerve berdegeneration. These molecules, thoughproduced to compensate for a short inthe neural signaling circuit, ultimately\u2014and ironically\u2014initiate a series of eventsthat cause nerve damage. To relay signals to other neurons, healthy nerve cells are studded withsodium channels that open in succes-sion along the nerve ber to allow insurges of sodium when neurons becomeactivated. To help propagate this signal,an outer coating of myelin insulates thenerve cells. But in those with MS, themyelin breaks down, causing a short inthe signal circuit. Waxman and col-leagues found that MS neurons compen-sate for this defect by overexpressing thesodium channel Nav 1.6\u2014normally pres- ent only at small regions called nodes of Ranvier\u2014all along the nerve ber toimprove the signal relay. However, the atypical Nav 1.6expression appears to cause more harm than good, as itcoincides with regions of axon injury. There are at least 10 types of sodium channels in human nerve cells, eachwith a different task, Waxman explained.\"It's as if you have 10 different types ofbatteries. Only the right batteries willmake a device work properly.\" In thiscase, the cells are using the wrong bat-teries in the wrong place. Theresearchers observed that another pro-tein called ncx, a sodium-calcium exchanger, is expressed near Nav 1.6 sites. The aberrant placement and over- abundance of Nav 1.6causes too much sodium to enter the cells. Overexpres-sion of ncx adjacent to Nav 1.6chan- nels presumably flushes out the excesssodium and replaces it with calcium.But too much calcium provokes molecu-lar chain reactions, sending cells intoactivity overdrive that results in cellulardamage and disease symptoms. In a field long dominated by immunobiologists, Waxman is enthusi-astic about the contributions to theunderstanding of MS that he and hisneurobiologist colleagues are making.\"We are chipping away at the diseasemolecule by molecule, and we areunderstanding more about the diseaseprocess,\" he said. Based on his research,Waxman is eager to try targeting theneurons for treatment; all approved MStherapies currently target the immunesystem. Consistent with his researchndings, he said, \"Drugs that blocksodium channels prevent axonal death.\"Consequently, he is involved in anupcoming clinical trial that will testsodium channel blockers in MS patients. \u2014K.N.PICTURING AN ENZYMATIC RNA More than 20 years ago scientists discovered that rna , and not just proteins, could act like an enzyme. Now Yale researchers haveobtained the first X-ray crystal structure ofthis type of enzymatic rna . The image caught an rna molecule as it spliced together two exons, the parts of a gene that code for pro-teins. Also visible in the image were a full-length noncoding intron and metal ionsbound in the molecule's active site. The rna acts like an enzyme so it can overcome an inherent hindrance to proteinsynthesis\u2014the intron that separates theexons. With the help of the metal ions,the rna connects the exons and removes the intron sequence. \"This is the first rna splicing complex to be visualized in molecular detail,\" saidScott A. Strobel, ph.d ., professor of molecu- lar biophysics and biochemistry and chemis-try, and principal investigator of the study published in the journal Nature in June. \u2014K.N. HOW SALMONELLA SURVIVES Yale scientists have discovered how Salmo- nella , a bacterium that causes food poisoning and typhoid, escapes the innate immune system's efforts to destroy it. Typically, bacte-ria are gobbled up by macrophages, whichsend bacteria to an execution chamber calleda lysozome for degradation. While they await degradation, Salmo- nella sit in a holding cell called a vacuole and begin to plan their escape. They secrete aprotein, SopB, that changes the compositionof the vacuole. This allows the bacterium to escape and find a friendlier compartmentwhere they can replicate and avoid innateimmune defenses. \" Salmonella have an elegant strategy for surviving and replicating and avoidingthis cellular disposal system,\" said Jorge E. Gal\u00e1n, d.v.m., ph.d ., chair of the Section of Microbial Pathogenesis, the Lucille P . Markey Professor of Microbiology and principal investigator of the study pub-lished in Science in June. \"Our work is revealing a fundamental mechanism bywhich these bacteria cause disease\u2014and may lead to new targets or strategiesfor controlling them.\" \u2014 John Curtis 12 books &ideas bookshelfyale medicine fall/win ter 200 4Yale Medical Bookstore manager Donald M. Levy was ring- ing up three hefty surgery texts when he suggested to thecustomer, a surgical resident, that he take a look at Zollinger's Atlas of Surgical Operations . Levy wasn 't expecting to make a sale: the Atlas costs $199, about what the resident had just spent. Nevertheless,the surgeon opened the book, checked the index and beganreading. \"This is the operation I had to do yesterday,\" hesaid. \"If I'd had this book, I would have been better off.\" He bought the book. Making that sale wasn 't Levy's primary motive. \"I don 't like being sold stuff, myself,\" says Levy, a warm, talkativeman who remembers customers by name. \"There's a subtledifference between offering and selling.\" Levy has managed the store at 320 Congress Avenue, which is owned by Barnes & Noble, since it opened inOctober 2001.

He was 17 years old in March 1942 when his father, John HenryBumstead, m.d .,was caring for 33-year-old Anne Miller. Neither transfusions nor surgery nor sulfa drugs had cured Miller of a strepto-coccal infection. She was dying and Bumstead was desperate. His colleague, physiologist John F. Fulton, ph.d .,m.d ., had befriended the Australian researcher Howard W. Florey, ph.d ., and helped him come to the United States to begin production of penicillin; Bumsteadasked Fulton to obtain a sample of the still-experimental antibiotic.It worked, and Miller lived to be 90. When he died in July 2003, the younger Bumstead remem- bered in his will the medical library, as well as Connecticut's historic Mystic Seaport, where he was a librarian, and New Haven's St. Thomas' Episcopal Church, where he was a parishioner. Bumsteadleft $1.2 million to the Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney MedicalLibrary. Director R. Kenny Marone, m.l.s ., used the gift to endow a librarianship at what she calls \"one of the premier medical historicallibraries in the world.\" Built in 1940, the library was established by three men who donated their collections of tens of thousands of volumes of medicalliterature: neurosurgeon Harvey W. Cushing, m.d .; Swiss tuberculosis specialist Arnold C. Klebs, m.d .; and Fulton. Cushing, says librarian Toby Appel, ph.d .,m.l.s ., saw the library as \"the heart of the medical school,\" a uniting force in an age of increasing specialization. Thanksto Bumstead's gift, Appel is now the John Robinson BumsteadLibrarian for Medical History. The two-story room that holds much of the 125,000-volume historical collection has a vintage air, with a vaulted wooden ceiling,twin balconies and a fireplace. \"There's something special when youcan walk in and see Volume One of The Lancet ,\" says Marone. \"We just have marvelous resources.\" Among those using the historical librarynow is medical historian Michael Bliss, ph.d ., at work on a biography of Cushing.

How else to explain a disease that killedentire families with no regardfor their station in life andwiped out as many as two-thirds of a city's inhabitants? Along with the civic disrup- tion came a spiritual catastro-phe. The plague struck so swiftlythat it denied its victims thechance to indulge the ritualsthat eased the passage to death,said John T. Paoletti, ph.d .' 6 7 , professor of art history atWesleyan University. As the plague spread, artists turned to images of Madonna ofthe Misericordia and St. Sebastian,protectors against the plague,Paoletti said. Cherubic angelsflinging arrows at their victimssymbolized the still-unexplainedplague as victims sought protec-tion from saints and the VirginMary, who offered her cloak as a shelter. Medicine of the timeoffered little hope againstthe plague. \"Your salvation is dependent upon a confession, on othersacraments, sometimes theEucharist,\" he told an audienceat the Program for Humanitiesin Medicine in April. \"The doctoris The confessor is dead.And if to come to your house.\" \u2014John CurtisPAUL FARMER A human rights view of health care \"What is the cost of not doing the right thing?\" Paul Farmer, m.d., ph.d. , asked in March dur- ing a talk sponsored by theDiversity Action Committee atthe School of Nursing. With thatquestion he challenged the cost-benefit analysis that underpinsmost global health projects. In Haiti, where he has spent most of his career, no patient,he said, has ever told him,\"Thank you very much for offer-ing me this therapy, but it'sreally not cost-effective here.\" In 1987 Farmer co-founded Partners In Health ( pih), which is dedicated to improving healthcare in poor countries. pih's low- cost projects have achievedimpressive outcomes in settingswhere resources were thoughtto be too scarce to make mod-ern interventions practical. Theircure rate for multidrug-resistantTB\u2014using innovative drug pro-curement strategies and locallytrained community health workers\u2014was 83.3 percent inthe slums of Lima, Peru. Thesame model delivers antiretrovi-rals for aids patients in rural Haiti and in inner-city Boston. He urged his listeners to have a \"technically correcthuman rights perspective,\" inwhich feasibility is a problem to be solved, rather than anexcuse for inaction. \u2014Colleen ShaddoxSTEVEN ROSENBERG Cautious excitement about a \"living cancer reagent\" The patient was a 57-year-old radiologist with advancedmelanoma. The treatment wasexperimental\u2014it combinedimmune-sensitized T and it hadworked for a 16-year-old boy atdeath's door. After years ofunsuccessful trials, the therapyhad evolved to the point whereit made a volleyball-sized tumordisappear from the boy's pelvisand left him free of disease. Did the new patient want to try it? \"He said, ' Absolutely, doc.I want to receive this new treat-ment while it's still working!' \"recalled Steven A. Rosenberg, m.d., ph.d. , head of the surgery branch at the National CancerInstitute. The patient was joking, but years of effort with vaccine andcell transfer therapies for cancerare starting to pay off, Rosenbergsaid at Cancer Center grandrounds in May. Combining CD4cells with sensitized CD8 cells in the right proportion made thedifference. \"We gave the [16-year-old] patient a cell packet of23 grams, and it made over halfa kilogram of tumor disappear,\"he said. \"The reason is that it's a living cancer reagent. Thesecells continue to live life among the viruses By Kendall PowellJordi Casals-Ariet spent his life studying and categorizing viruses, and in 1969 his search for the agent behind the mysterious Lassa fever almost killed him. But his near-lethal infection pavedthe way for improvements in lab safety. When virologist Jordi Casals-Ariet, m.d., died last February at age 92, his obitu-aries highlighted two salient facets ofhis life; the system he designed for clas-sifying the viruses that he spent his lifestudying, and how one of those virusesalmost killed him in 1969. The virus first appeared that same year in three missionary nurses inNigeria\u2014a mysterious fever killedtwo of them in days. Casals-Ariet'slaboratory at the School of PublicHealth seemed the logical place tostudy samples of the nurses' bloodcontaining the virus. The Yale Arbo-virus Research Unit ( yaru ) held the world's most extensive collection of arboviruses, which are spread byblood-sucking insects, and the pres-ence of leading virologists on the faculty offered the best chance of iso-lating the agent behind the fever. Casals-Ariet and Sonja M. Buckley, m.d., an expert in tissue cultures, took on the task of isolating and identifyingthe lethal virus, named Lassa for theNigerian town where it appeared, andaltered their laboratory methods accord-ingly. They limited access to the virusand sealed off several lab rooms at theLaboratory of Epidemiology and PublicHealth. \"I slowed down and becamemeticulous in my techniques,\" Buckleyrecalled in her autobiography, \"since wecould not know how highly virulent thisinfectious agent might be.\" Early in June 1969, three months after the virus arrived at Yale, Casals-Ariet fell ill with fever, chills and severemuscle aches, which he brushed off as a cold. By June 15 he was in an isolationunit. His only hope was the survivingnurse, Lily Pinneo, who was recoveringat home in Rochester, N.Y . Researcherslassa nigeria17 17 and doctors debated whether to give Casals-Ariet her antibody-containingplasma. Although they were convincedhe had Lassa fever, a conrmation wouldtake 96 hours, time he didn 't have. Ifthey were wrong, an infusion of anti-bodies might cause a cross-reaction.Robert W. McCollum, then chair of theDepartment of Epidemiology and PublicHealth, said yaru researchers ultimately recommended using the antibodies. \"Nobody knew what else to do,\" he said in an interview from his home inNew Hampshire. Casals-Ariet recovered and con- tinued his research. That Thanksgiving,however, lab technician Juan Romanbecame ill and died. Lassa fever wasconrmed, sending chills through theresearch group\u2014Roman had neverworked with the virus. Work on the livevirus was halted and all samples weresent to a maximum-security lab at the Centers for Disease Control ( cdc). How Casals-Ariet and Roman con- tracted Lassa fever remains a mystery.McCollum and others suspect that thetwo inhaled virus particles from dustkicked up by infected mice. Casals-Arietworked in the same room with the cagesand Roman may have passed by theroom or talked to him from the doorway. \"The incident forced changes to biosafety nationally, and was one of theseminal events in [bringing about mod-ern] biosafety,\" said Ben for Yale anda Certied Biological Safety Professionalaccredited by the American BiologicalSafety Association. He credits the yaru group's extremely careful precautions with preventing other infections at Yale.Yet, as a result of these and other labo-ratory infections, a classication systemfor viruses, bacteria and other pathogens was created to ensure safe working con-ditions. After Roman 's death, unidenti-ed infectious agents like Lassa weresent to the safest possible lab facilities. Casals-Ariet went on to investigate Lassa outbreaks in West Africa. In 1973biologists in Sierra Leone, aided by the Yale and cdc teams, determined that Lassa virus spread from wild ratsto humans. Casals-Ariet also worked with the cdc to set up what eventually became the World Health Organiza-tion 's reference collection of arboviruses.His longest-lasting research legacy,however, may be the virus classica-tion system he developed that showsthe relationships of different animaland human viruses\u2014critical infor-mation for developing vaccines and tracking and treating epidemics.

We are goingto meet Liony's Uncle Big, afamous voodoo doctor fourhours away in Haiti's the Artibonite The radio about today's demonstra-tion against the govern-ment. It's early Februaryand for three months students have demanded the resignation of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Their cry has been taken up by businessleaders and civil society, who say Aristide is responsible forthe disappearance of journalists, the death of the economyand violent attacks on peaceful protesters. But most peopleare just angry at being poor. When Aristide became presi-dent in 1994 most Haitians believed that this priest from the slums would lift them out of poverty. Yet most Haitianshave only gotten poorer; today more than 80 percent ofHaitians live in poverty and many of them blame Aristide. Moliere winces and shakes his head. Forty people have been killed and hundreds wounded in antigovernmentdemonstrations. It has become increasingly difcult to workin Port-au-Prince. More than once Moliere and I have hid-den in an alley or screeched up the road in reverse becausedemonstrations disintegrated into a storm of tear gas, stonesand bullets as protesters clashed with riot police or Aristide'sarmed supporters, known locally as chim\u00e8res . I look out the window and wonder what today's demonstrations will bring. I rst went to Haiti as a Yale student on a Downs Fellowship in the summer of 2002, to coordinate a lm proj-ect about aids and social stigma. Due to funding problems, the project was never completed. I returned to Yale to nishmaster's degrees in public health and African studies, yet I could not let go of my memories of Haiti and her coura-geous hiv community. Right before I graduated in May 2003 I won a Fulbright Scholarship, and that fall I touched down in Port-au-Prince. \"I made it,\" I kept thinking, and was both exhila- rated and overwhelmed. I had worked as a summer intern at National Public Radio ( npr), but I had never made a lm before. Making lms, I felt, couldn 't be that different frommaking radio. The trick is to tell a good story. I wanted to record the stories of people living with hiv/aids , and distribute them in Haiti as a way to reduce stigma and discrimination. Haiti's national television net-work was behind me, as were international organizationswilling to use the videos in outreach campaigns. In a countrywhere almost half of the people cannot read or write, videosand group discussions can break the silence about aids . Over six months, I lmed dozens of men and women\u2014 some of whom hid their faces\u2014as they shared a bit of theirlives. Some spoke of their fear of orphaning their children,others of their shame at public humiliation, but most spokeof their desire to live and do a little bit of good in the world. I met Liony through the small, vocal, hiv-positive net- work in Port-au-Prince. Liony is unforgettable. Tall, dapper,with a wife and a handful of children, he has a talent formaking people listen. He spends most of his time workingin a grass-roots organization as one of Port-au-Prince's only aids counselors. \"People think I am a curiosity,\" he says, chuckling. \"Sometimes I sit for hours on my doorstep and answer peo-ple's questions. ... Yes, I still live with my wife, yes we eat the same food, yes my kids play with other kids. Do I sleepwith her?\" He winks and laughs. \"Yes I do, with condoms of course. ... though not so much anymore. I need to keepmy strength, mon cher !\" Liony gets free antiretrovirals ( arvs) at and OpportunisticInfection ( gheskio ), one of two research centers in Haiti that distribute medicine to people with full-blown aids . Haiti has about 400,000 aids cases in a population of 8.2 million, yet only 1 percent receive aids drugs, either through gheskio in Port-au-Prince or the Zanmi Lasante clinic in central Haiti run by Paul Farmer, m.d., ph.d . This may soon change. With millions of dollars pouring in from the Global Fund To Fight aids , Tuberculosis and Malaria as well as President Bush 's Emergency Planfor aids Relief, more than 30 percent of Haiti's aids patients\u2014120,000 people\u2014are expected to receive arv treatment in the next five years. 21 21 \"You know, if I hadn 't gone to the houngan two years ago, I probably never would have gotten so sick,\" Liony says,shaking his head, \"But then again I wouldn 't be on treat-ment now either.\" A houngan is a voodoo doctor. And when people are sick in rural Haiti, the houngan is usually the rst person they'll see. Most rural Haitians believe that illness is theresult of evil, caused by a vengeful or jealous neighbor. Andwith only 2.5 physicians per 10,000 people, health care inrural areas is not always an option. So the houngan becomes a logical place to seek help. Unfortunately for people with aids , the treatment they get from a houngan usually makes their situation worse. \"I had to drink this brown liquid and sleep outside for days at a time. I spent my savings on it. And in the end,man, I just got sicker and poorer,\" Liony says. After a fewweeks, Liony's father found him weak and shivering, andcarried him to a health clinic. \"I had pneumonia,\" Liony says. \"But the good thing is, I went on medications.\" When Liony's doctor saw that hisT-cell count was below 200, he referred Liony to gheskio for treatment. \"aids isaids. A curse is a curse.\" We enter the sprawl of Cit\u00e9 Soleil, the slum on the edge of Port-au-Prince famed for its mind-bending poverty andpatrolling chim\u00e8res . We weave through crowds of people step- ping crisply over open sewage. A lucky few are on their wayto jobs in the industrial complex, assembling baseballs or T-shirts for a buck fty a day. In a country where unemploy-ment soars to 70 percent, $1.50 seems like a godsend. Wecome to a roadblock guarded by kids with dreds, and Moliereinstinctively turns down the radio and flashes an open palm.\" Cinq ans !\" the hand says, \"Five years! Five more years for Aristide!\" Moliere doesn 't support Aristide, but here an openpalm is a ticket to safety. We leave Cit\u00e9 Soleil and drive over broken roads, past fishing villages, rice paddies and women hawkingpeanuts and melons. Then the land dries up and the dust rises. \"See those up there?\" Liony says, pointing to little shacks on the hillsides. \"Those are all peristyles , the temples where houngans receive their clients.\" Peristyles dot the naked hillsides as far as the eye can see. We walk a maze of dusty footpaths to Big's peristyle . It is a work of art. The temple walls are covered with murals ofsaints, serpents and mermaids, and the air flutters under acanopy of colored streamers. Big is sitting outside on a stoolin front of a large painting of the Virgin Mary and a rainbow. \"Uncle Big!\" Liony calls out, and Big chuckles and spits. He has a fat belly and old red eyes. He waves childrenaway and gestures for me to sit. I ask him what he knowsabout aids . His response leaves me floored. \"aids is aids . A curse is a curse. Now diarrhea can be supernatural. But aids ...\" Big pauses to spit in the dirt, \"nope, aids can 't.\" Most houngans claim they can cure the \" aids curse,\" called m\u00f2 sida in Creole. They say you get m\u00f2 sida when your enemy makes a powder out of someone who died from aids and blows it on you. If Big thinks someone might have aids , I ask, what does he tell them? \"What canI tell them? I say, did you go to the doctor ... no? Well then go and get an hiv test. Then you can come back.\" In Haiti, this is unheard of. Most people prefer not to know their serostatus\u2014a positive result hangs like a deathsentence. But being told to get an hiv test by a houngan could be just the encouragement people need to seek testing and counseling. \"If the test is positive, I say there is nothing more I can do.\" Big raises his hands in the air. \"Because the prob-lem isn 't mystical, it's medical. And they need to go see amedical doctor to resolve it. I can 't cure aids !\" But what about all the houngans who say they can? \" Ah! It's all bluff! Bluff!\" Big is clearly upset by the question. \" Houngans can 't treat aids ! I mean, look around, now honestly, what would I use to treat aids ?\" I do look around. I see a skull lying on a miniature cofn, a brown baby doll head, an American flag and threeplastic coke bottles. Less than 20 years ago scientists wereasking themselves the same question\u2014what can we use to treat aids ? Well, we've got our answer. Treatment exists. Now the big question is, how do we get treatment to the people who most need it\u2014poor people living on the marginsof global society? Sitting in Big's peristyle in the dusty plains of the Artibonite, it dawns on me that for Haiti the answer may sitat the crossroads of public health and voodoo. Public health Unlike other voodoo doctors Liony's Uncle Big does not claim he can cure aids . \"The problem isn't mysti- ter 200 422 A film to finish his M16 trained on my left shoulder. I feel a hot red point where the bullet would enter. He is screaming at me, and I am paralyzed. When I hear Moliere's frantic footstepsbehind me, I shout the only thing that comes into my head: \"i am a journalist! i am a journalist!\u2014please! don 't shoot !\" My only proof is my expired intern badge from npr, but in retrospect, I believe this saves us both. Lucky for me, dead white journalists are bad press for Aristide. In darkness, a candle brings light Haitians have a saying: \"When you run from the rain you only end up falling in a big river.\" In the weeks that followed, the country crumbled around our ears, and in mid-February the city imploded.People stayed indoors while businesses were looted, neigh-borhoods were barraged with tear gas and roads blocked byflames. The nights were lled with gunre and shouts andthe days saw hospitals overflowing. Yet the storerooms werebare and many doctors stayed home because, as in the caseof Canap\u00e9 Vert, even the hospital becomes a war zone. I watched my work become insignicant as people's conception of risk changed entirely. It is hard to think about aids when staring down the barrel of a gun. So while I wasn 't surprised when, a few days before Aristide left thecountry on February 28, I was told by the U.S. Embassy toevacuate, I was overcome with a feeling of great loss. But in moments of darkness, one candle brings light. While I am packing my bags, my cell phone rings. It is Liony. \" Amelia! When are we going back to the Artibonite? We need to lm another interview with Big!\" Liony is unstoppable. A group of armed rebels\u2014 disgruntled chim\u00e8res , drug trafckers and convicted crimi- nals\u2014had taken over the Artibonite the week before andwere moving south. They have sealed off the country'snorthern corridor, setting the stage for a scene Haitians haveseen too many times: state decapitation. Whereas over adecade ago, Aristide rose to the presidency on an unprece-dented wave of popular support, this week he is about tobecome just another overthrown dictator in Haiti. When I tell Liony I've been ordered to evacuate, he doesn 't miss a beat. \"Don 't worry, you'll be back. We have a lm to nish.\" His voice is both condent and nonchalant. \"You know, ourprofessionals around the world need to keep advocating for affordable drugs in poor countries. And then they need tocollaborate with the people on the ground who really make a difference. No matter how unorthodox his methods, a guy like Big is saving lives. By afrming the role of medicine in aworld dominated by the supernatural, he is directing ruralpeople to the tests and treatment they need. If more houn- gans follow Big's lead, Haiti could see a turning point in the ght against aids . A hospital becomes a war zone On our return the capital disintegrates into chaos. The radio reports that a student was shot with a tear- gas canister and taken to Canap\u00e9 Vert hospital for emergencysurgery. While doctors are trying to remove the canister from his abdomen, it explodes. I am picturing white smokepouring out of a wound in a young man 's body. The hospitalis evacuated. The student dies. His classmates surround thehospital, enraged. As the violence escalates I am drawn to epicenters of conflict to lm, to record, to try and understand the country.I sometimes want to play reporter, but it isn 't journalism thatinspires me\u2014it's public health. Because journalists are cyni-cal, and I still believe in the power to change. Moliere and I leave Liony at his house and then go to the hospital. The chain of events is fast and brutal. Studentsdrag abandoned cars into the road and light them on re.The riot police nger their M16s. Pistols crack on the hill-side, and a woman screams, \"The chim\u00e8res are coming down the hill!\" The road explodes in a flurry of shouts and lostshoes. The police storm the flaming barricades\u2014sparks fly,bullets fly, students fly or hit the ground and pray. Rat tat tat tat tat tat tat. If you have ever stood near machine gun re, you know the sound: loud, and very, very mean. The hospital becomes a battleground. Patients in white robes running in panic tot-ter and fall in the courtyard. Doctors scream. Students hideand riot police chase them from room to room. In the confu-sion, a woman is raped on the operating table. She had beenrecovering from minor surgery; her story was broadcast onthat night's news. I run through the thick smoke with my camera, and come face to face with a riot police ofcer in sniper position,Amelia Shaw in a self-portrait taken at Big's peristyle .In late July Yale Medicine received this e-mail from Amelia Shaw: I arrived in Haiti two days ago. ... It has been an emotional journey. The poverty here is stultifying\u2014it shocks you even when youexpect it. Things are much calmer than when I left, but a lot ofunreported violent crime occurs in the slums, where most of myfriends live. And floods have knocked out parts of their houses,leaving them open to intruders. People seem tired, very weary of\"the everyday\" in Haiti, which includes the most hair-raising bitsand pieces of reality. The money has deflated in value, but priceshave not, and a lot of people can't buy food. But the good things are there too\u2014the electricity is on most of the time. And the musicians have returned, which is asign of relative stability. United Nations vehicles are everywhere,and hopefully the police are strengthening in numbers. I saw Liony today. It was such a happy moment! That has been the best for me, to see the people I have worked with soclosely! I am so happy to be back here! It is wonderful, though italso makes my heart bleed.2323 lm is really going to change the way Haitians think about treating aids .\" For the rest of the afternoon, my cell phone does not stop ringing. Liony has mobilized the entire aids commu- nity to give me a message: \"Hey Amelia! Don lose hope!You'll be back\u2014we have a lm to nish!\" I am touched thatthey are calling to comfort me\u2014after all, I am the healthyone getting out. Yet I learned that day that the optimism of hiv- positive Haitians is unbreakable. By force of will, they beatthe odds and survive in a world where magic and danger collide\u2014often with deadly consequences. These people areheroes. They are also Haiti's hidden treasure. Because whenthe rumbling stops and the smoke clears, Liony and hiscomrades will be the rst to climb from the wreckage. Theywill smile and rub their hands, ready to rebuild stone bystone. And God willing, I will be there with them too. Afterall, we dohave a lm to nish. YMStaying safe abroad Facing instability like the recent upheaval in Haiti may be the norm rather than the exception forpeople working in internationalhealth, says Frank J. Bia, m.d ., m.p.h., fw '79, co-director of the Yale/Johnson & Johnson PhysicianScholars in International Healthprogram, which sends residents tomore than 14 countries. \"The inher-ent nature of international healthis working in an unstable world,\"says Bia, professor of medicine(infectious disease) and laboratorymedicine. \"It's unstable becauseit's unfair, and I think it's gettingworse.\" Increasingly, he said, theworld's poor are becoming awareof \"how bad off things really are interms of the increasingly skeweddistribution of both wealth andtechnological resources.\" Since the international pro- gram began in 1981, more than 100 Yale residents have volun-teered for a month or two atHaiti's H\u00f4pital Albert Schweitzer.The program has rarely suspendedactivities due to turmoil abroad,but temporarily stopped sendingphysician volunteers to Haiti thisyear, said program co-director and professor of medicine andpublic health Michele Barry, m.d., hs'77. She expected that rota- tions in Haiti would resume laterthis year. (Four years ago Yale sus-pended its program in Zimbabwein the wake of widespread vio-lence there.) Second-year resident Emmanu- elle Cl\u00e9rism\u00e9-Beaty, m.d . '02, found herself in a strange situa-tion while volunteering in Haitilast January in the weeks preced-ing the ouster of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Although mostforeigners felt safe at the hospi-tal, she was harassed by hospitalworkers who wanted her to joinprotests against the hospitaladministration. Cl\u00e9rism\u00e9-Beaty,who grew up in Haiti and speaks Creole, was taken for a \"local.\" \"It got pretty scary,\" she recalls. She chose to leave a few days early,catching a ride to the airport beforedawn to reduce the danger ofbeing robbed on the road. Cl\u00e9rism\u00e9-Beaty feels ambivalent about theexperience. \"Being there, you knewyou were needed, and you wereappreciated,\" she says, adding, \"Ididn't really feel safe.\" For those in charge of send- ing students and residents abroad,security is always a concern.Summers are nerve-wracking forCurtis L. Patton, ph.d ., head of the Division of Global Health atthe School of Public Health. Pattondirects the Downs InternationalHealth Student Travel Fellowshipprogram, which funds research for about 16 students of publichealth, nursing and medicine whospend a summer abroad. He relies on four sources to judge the safety of research sites: advisories from the StateDepartment and the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention,Yale College's list of countriesdeclared off-limits to undergradu-ates and information gleaneddirectly from people at the sites.This spring he advised one studentto avoid Haiti. She went anyway,and \"she seems to be fine,\"Patton reported in mid-summer.He barred another student fromstudying diarrheal diseases in Iraq;she went to Tanzania instead. \"I have my heart in my throat all summer until they return,\"says Patton. \u2014Cathy Shufro Amelia Shaw, m.p.h.'03, graduated from Yale in 2003 with joint master's degrees in public health and African studies.

His laboratory team includes (from left) Eunice Park, WayneFenton, Krystyna Furtak, J\u00f6rgHinnerwisch, Horwich, George Farr and Fernando Agarraberes.For almost two decades Arthur Horwich has been unraveling a basic biological mystery:how proteins achieve their native shapes. By Cathy Shufro Photograph by Terry Dagradi hristian B. Annsen, ph.d ., biochemist at the NationalInstitutes of Health ( nih) , in the early 1960s answeredone of biology's fundamentalquestions. He explainedwhere proteins get the march-ing orders that theirmetamorphosis from aminoacid chains into active, func- tional three-dimensional sheets and helices. Function followsform, and those distinctive shapes dictate how the proteinswork. Shape allows the lock-like structure of an antibody totrap the key-shaped antigen to ght infection; it allows anenzyme to work on a specic substrate to speed up a chemi-cal reaction, such as digesting food; and it permits a hemo-globin protein to bind to oxygen and carry it in the blood.But when a protein is improperly folded, its function is lost,and that can lead to disease. Scientists already understood that dna embodies a code that is transcribed onto rna, which in turn directs the cell to produce the 30,000 vital proteins that are the body'sbuilding blocks. Scientists recognized that these polypeptidechains\u2014composed of the 20 amino acids\u2014don 't function as proteins until they have folded, but they did not know,before Annsen, where proteins got the instructions to fold. Annsen shared a Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1972 for a simple experiment that yielded remarkable results. Heunfolded an enzyme to see if it could nd its way back to its active, folded form. It did, showing that the sequence ofamino acids itself contains the information that tells a pro-tein how to fold, and that the protein folds spontaneously. That seemed to be the nal answer when Arthur L. Horwich, m.d., hs '78, was studying biochemistry as a fresh- man at Brown University in 1969. But 18 years later, Horwich,by then an assistant professor of genetics at Yale, began tothink there might be more to protein folding. While studyingthe passage of unfolded proteins through membranes intomitochondria, the cell's power source, he asked whether a specialized protein might be assisting the folding process. Annsen had correctly discerned that amino acid sequences do provide the information needed for folding, butHorwich found evidence that many amino acid chains needhelp: he discovered \"folding machines\" that provide that help. 26 Getting the right fold The chaperonin GroEL, shown here with the co-chaperonin GroES,helps proteins fold properly. Now the Eugene Higgins Professor of Genetics and Pediatrics and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute ( hhmi ) investigator, Horwich has spent 17 years studying those machines. \"This work is as basic to biology as understanding the nature of genes and how genes are expressed and translatedinto proteins,\" says colleague Richard P. Lifton, m.d., ph.d ., the chair and Sterling Professor of Genetics at Yale and an hhmi investigator. \"The part that is really breathtaking about Art's work is that he went all the way from basic discovery ofthe protein-folding machine to understanding how it workson an atomic level. ... It's just one of the nicest pieces of workone will ever see in biology.\" Seeking what's never been seen Horwich rarely sets foot in his ofce at the Boyer Center for Molecular Medicine. He'd rather be in the lab. \"I just have never matured beyond postdoc,\" jokes Horwich, a slim man with unruly brown hair, glasses and adroopy, graying moustache. \"I still work at the bench everyday. I still like to do my own experiments. I like to be able tolive with and suffer through the problems of understandinghow things work side by side with my own people, and Ialways have one or two things for myself that I consider myown laboratory struggle.\" When Horwich must be away, he calls daily to check on the progress made by his 10-member team. \"I drive them nuts.\" \"He's a very, person,\" says Krystyna J. Furtak, m.s., an hhmi research technician who has worked with Horwich for 20 years. Dressed in faded corduroys, winter and summer, Horwich sets up his experiments beside the makeshift ofcehe has created at the end of his bench, where piles of journalsand papers rise from the floor and windowsill. The lab drawsHorwich like a magnet, because there each day holds out the chance, however small, \"to see something that's not beenseen before.\" Horwich grew up in River Forest, a Chicago suburb where he enjoyed snowball ghts that endangered pricelessstained-glass windows in the neighborhood's Frank LloydWright homes. His father, Walter, a Chicago businessman,shares Horwich 's interest in science. \"He was a sort of frustrated scientist,\" Horwich says. \"He let me be a ham [radio] operator and he was just as inter-Cyalemedicine fall/win ter 200 4 zha ohu i xu27 size, yet showed no sign of enzyme activity. That would sug- gest that it had not folded. They found such a mutant withindays. They could hardly believe what they were seeing. They traced the mutation that disabled folding to a defective gene for mitochondrial heat shock protein (calledHsp60). Heat shock proteins, scientists believed, played a role in protecting already folded proteins. When Horwichand Cheng inserted a normal gene for Hsp60 into themutant yeast, protein folding resumed. \"It didn 't just hold the proteins,\" says Horwich, who still sounds excited 17 years later. \"It folded them. It was a folding machine.\" But Horwich 's team was not ready to announce the dis- covery. \"We thought there must be something else to explainit. ... We were terried of being wrong.\" They worked withanother group in Germany to conrm their Thatgroup was led by Franz-Ulrich Hartl, m.d., ph.d ., a director of the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, who along with Horwich and R. John Ellis, ph.d ., of the University of Warwick in the U.K., won the 2004 International Awardfrom the nonprot Gairdner Foundation, which recognizesoutstanding achievements in biomedical research. The threewere honored for having \"revolutionized our understandingabout basic cellular functions.\" In 1989, after a year of testing and retesting of a variety of proteins in mutant yeasts, Horwich and Hartl pub-lished their findings in Nature . Working together, the scientists and their teams went on to show that specializedproteins mediate protein folding in archaebacteria, pro-karyotes and eukaryotes. In the years that followed their discovery of the role of Hsp60, Horwich and his colleagues turned to understand-ing the inner workings of a closely related folding machinein bacteria called GroEL, using genetic, biochemical andstructural that resembles twostacked doughnuts. Chaperonins begin their work by binding an unfolded or misfolded polypeptide molecule inside one of the rings(see diagram on page 29). The working principle, Horwichsays, is that unfolded or misfolded polypeptide chainsexpose hydrophobic (\"greasy\") surfaces that become buriedto the in the fully folded, functional (\"native\") form.In the nonnative state, the exposed surface of one proteinested as me. He was up on the roof with me putting up antenna systems. He had to draw the line when I wanted tobounce the signal off the moon. He wouldn 't let me put adish up on the roof.\" Horwich graduated in 1975 from Brown Medical School, where he was class valedictorian, a fact he mentionsonly to tell a story on himself. \"I gave this speech sayingBrown should train great primary care physicians. So Ipromptly went off and did research.\" He jokes that his par-ents took the speech to heart. \"I think the folks are still waiting for me to practice medicine.\" During his pediatrics residency at Yale he felt the lure of genetics. After his residency, he spent three years atthe Salk Institute in California with tumor biologists WalterEckhart, ph.d ., and Tony Hunter, ph.d . \"I watched Tony make what is probably one of the most important discoveries of the latter part of the 20th cen-tury,\" Horwich recalls. In 1979 Hunter discovered tyrosinephosphorylation, a process that plays a role in normal cellsignaling and growth and that also contributes to the forma-tion of cancerous tumors if it goes awry: of 300 genes impli-cated in cancer, 90 encode tyrosine kinases. \" Art still works in the lab, which amazes me,\" says Hunter, still at the Salk Institute. \"He seems to have retainedthe enthusiasm for science and the day-to-day excitement that most well-established scientists running big labs seem to lose.\" Horwich returned to Yale in 1981 to work with human geneticist Leon E. Rosenberg, m.d., hs '63 , who later became dean of the School of Medicine. \"I worked with a large number of postdoctoral fellows, but none hadArt's combination of brilliance, a love of experimentationand a fearlessness to learn what he needed to learn to go further,\" says Rosenberg, now a professor at Princeton. A late-night discussion and a mutant yeast Horwich 's rst signicant discovery grew out of a late-night conversation in 1987 with then-graduate student MingCheng, m.d., ph.d ., about whether unfolded proteins cross- ing membranes into mitochondria might get help foldinginto active forms. \"Maybe there's such a thing as a foldingmachine,\" Horwich proposed. Using a library of mutantyeast strains, they looked for one in which a protein that hadclearly entered the mitochondria had reached its mature28 Getting the right fold can stick to that of another, setting off a process of multi- molecular aggregation. This results in an inactive proteinthat cannot perform its intended function; in addition,aggregates can harm the cell. Binding in a chaperonin ringserves to mask such surfaces of the nonnative protein,because the chaperonin itself has a cavity lining that is ahydrophobic surface, which interacts with that of the nonnative protein. It is thus prevented from aggregating. The machine then switches to a folding-active state by binding atp, a unit of energy currency, and a lid structure, a co-chaperonin called GroES. The chaperonin ring that bindsGroES undergoes large, structural changes that cause itshydrophobic lining to turn away from the bound polypeptideand interact directly with GroES. In the process, the poly-peptide is released into the now-encapsulated chamber,where it folds to its native form. Proper folding is favored inthis chamber, because the polypeptide is in solitary conne-ment with nothing else to aggregate with, and because it isnow next to watery walls that encourage the burial of itshydrophobic surfaces and exposure of its watery ones, prop-erties of the nal native state. Finally, after 10 seconds, a stepof conversion of atpto adp causes the machine to release the lid structure, and the polypeptide leaves the cavity. As thecavity of the ring that had been occupied becomes emptied,the other ring swings into action to perform the same func-tion with another polypeptide chain. But each protein does not always fold properly on the rst try, and Horwich says the protein-folding mechanismreveals something fundamental about where a living celldirects its energy. The machine will try again and again to foldthe protein correctly.

The cell has decided it will spend a lot of atpto try and correctly edit the protein-folding process.\" The consequences of misfolded proteins can be dire. Misfolded proteins are linked to hundreds of devastating diseases\u2014including amyloid diseases such as Alzheimer's,Parkinson 's, Huntington 's, als(also known as Lou Gehrig's disease) and spongiform encephalopathies like mad cow disease. In the amyloid disorders, misfolded proteins sticktogether to form brils, or plaques, in the brain. Scientistsare not yet sure how these diseases occur. For example, theydon 't know whether the brils themselves injure the brain orwhether the misfolded proteins cause damage on their way to forming brils. Looking outside the cell After two decades of studying the genesis of proteins within the cell, Horwich is interested in what happens to proteinsin the extracellular spaces of the brain. During a break fromthe lab on a hot afternoon last summer, he mentions beingboth troubled and intrigued by a recent article in Nature examining the aging of the human brain. The article, \"Gene Regulation and dna Damage in the Ageing Human Brain,\" reports that brain function begins to deteriorate when we get\"old\"\u2014age 40 .\"That's the shocker,\" says Horwich. \" All the good things are going down\u2014vesicular trafcking, synapticplasticity. The dna is damaged increasingly. ... Yet all these machines that help us to repair damage, including the heatshock proteins, are getting induced.\" He sees some good news in this observation: ramped- up defenses suggest avenues for treating disease. Horwichenvisions two approaches. \"If you want to think about whatto do about neurological diseases that involve misfolded pro-teins, you could shut down production of the proteins thatget misfolded. Or you could upregulate this line of defense[provided by molecules like chaperonins].\" He wonders whether the body has other machines similar to chaperonins that might prevent the misfolding of proteins that causes disease. \"What other machine is outthere that we've really missed, that's outside the cell? Every-one's been focused inside the cell.\" One step is to learn about the structure of the brils formed by misfolded proteins in the brain. Horwich and his team, in collaboration with Wayne Hubbell, ph.d ., at ucla , have been using a spectroscopy approach to study how the normal structure of a serum protein, transthyretin (pre-albumin) gets converted into an amyloid in a disease knownas familial amyloid polyneuropathy. \"I really want to focus on these things. I don 't have an unlimited amount of time. After reading the Nature paper about the brain, I'm not too optimistic,\" says Horwich with a wry smile. He's 53. Horwich is not wedded to the idea of curing disease, however. \"Of course it would be wonderful,\" he says per-functorily. And he does not seem interested in fame.

It's the science itself that drives him. \"I'm particularlyinterested in seeing the beauty of how Mother Nature hashandled the problems of protein folding and this last step of information transfer. ... Mother Nature decided it's notgoing to leave even the step of protein folding to chance.\" Outside the lab, fishing and tennis Although Horwich spends long hours in the lab, that's not to say he works nonstop. On weekends, he plays tennis,sometimes with his 24-year-old daughter Annie, a photogra-pher. A few years ago, 26-year-old Michael, an m.d./ph.d . student at the University of Massachusetts, introduced hisfather to fly-shing. When it comes to shing nowadays, hisyoungest child, sixth-grader Dave, is \"a complete fanatic.\" Horwich is happy to get away occasionally, taking a few days off to relax on Block Island or backpack in theAdirondacks, \"because you think about things on a differentplane when you're not right up against it. I'm OK with being away from it for a while, but there's a feeling that it'stime to get back and touch it again.\" His wife, Martina Brueckner, m.d., fw '90 , under- stands the pull of the laboratory. An associate professor of pediatrics (cardiology), she studies the development ofleft-right asymmetry in the embryo, which affects the placement of the heart and viscera. They both spend longhours in the lab. What keeps him in the lab is not the anxiety of fall- ing behind, says Horwich. \"It's just: can we find the nextreally big thrill? There's no substitute for the thrills we'vehad. Most people are lucky if they have one. I've had two.\" The rst came after he and Cheng found the yeast mutant that failed to fold proteins. The second came whenHorwich saw for the rst time the structure of the bacterialchaperonin. For four challenging years in the 1990s,Horwich and his team had collaborated with the group ledby the late Yale structural biologist Paul B. Sigler, m.d., ph.d ., trying to get an image of the protein molecule. They grew hundreds of crystal forms of GroEL, altering eachslightly in hopes of finding one that would create a clearimage by means of X-ray crystallography. Then, at last, oneof Horwich 's graduate students, Kerstin Braig, hit upon acrystal that worked. It was a molecule that had an accidental mutation that made it diffract well. Horwich calls the dis-covery pure luck. Just a few days later, Horwich 's and Sigler's groups drove to the synchrotron at Cornell in Ithaca, N.Y ., wherethey could use its high-intensity X-ray source to collect moredata about the molecule. Assembling the data, or \"phasingthe crystal,\" required several trips over several months, andZbyszek Otwinowski, ph.d ., a member of Sigler's lab at the time, performed what Horwich describes as \"an amazingfeat.\" In just two days, Otwinowski \"solved the structure\" ofGroEL and created a three-dimensional model of the protein. \"We worked for four years trying to get the crystalline structure of this, and there it was, at atomic-level resolution.That was a religious moment.\" Having experienced these highs creates a certain tension. \"It's a wonderful experience, but you always won-der, are you ever going to have another really fabulous revelation?

This change has forced physicians to rethink the underpinnings not only of training, but also of patient care .3131 n the night of March 4, 1984, an 18-year-old patient namedLibby Zion was admitted tothe emergency room of CornellMedical Center's New YorkHospital complaining of feverand an earache. Just hourslater, while in the care of thehospital's residents, she laydead. Zion 's father, Sidney Zion, was a prominent, well-connected journalist and a for-mer federal prosecutor, and in what would soon becomenotorious as \"the Zion case,\" he and his wife led suit,claiming that the negligence of the hospital's overly fatiguedand poorly supervised house staff was the direct cause oftheir daughter's death. In the end, a New York grand jury did not nd suf- cient evidence that overtired residents were responsible for Zion 's death, and postmortem lab results suggested thatshe had died from an overdose of cocaine. But the enormouspublicity surrounding the Zion case cast a bright light onaspects of graduate medical education that the Americanpublic had long ignored. Medical residents' duty hours, oncean esoteric and jealously guarded prerogative of medicalschool faculty and hospital administrators, had become thefocus of intense interest on the part of legislators and regula-tory boards nationwide. In the wake of the Zion case, New York state and Puerto Rico enacted statutes that set limits on duty hours forhospital house staff. But the most signicant shock wavefrom the case wasn 't felt until July 2003, when the Accredita-tion Council for Graduate Medical Education ( acgme ), citing concerns for patient safety, imposed strict limits on residents'duty hours at all teaching hospitals. Though the rules them-selves are straightforward\u2014they limit residents to an 80-hourworkweek and 24 continuous hours on call, and guaranteeone day off each week\u2014they have set off a sea change inAmerican medical education and patient care. The traditionalresidency system was deeply ingrained in the educationalstructures of medical schools, and the presence of hardwork-ing, inexpensive house staff has long been taken for grantedby hospitals in their day-to-day operations. Yale is no exception. Some 175 new residents in spe- cialties as diverse as anesthesiology and urology arrive inNew Haven each year. Though most of these residents aretechnically employees of Yale-New Haven Hospital ( ynhh ), the dual educational and clinical missions of residency arereflected in the Graduate Medical Education Committee,which directly oversees the program and reports both to thechief of staff at ynhh and to the dean 's ofce at the School of Medicine. Some residency programs, such as pediatrics and psy- chiatry, have adapted fairly easily to the new rules, but for O the room of a newly admitted patient. By tradition, interns pres-ent cases, and Viera, a freshlyminted graduate of Tulane Uni-versity School of Medicine,betrays no fatigue or uncertaintyas she fashions clipped, efficientclinical narratives from the bliz-zard of acronyms, abbreviationsand numerals that are the linguafranca of modern medicine. The truism that today's patients are far sicker than those under resi-dents' care 30 years ago is nowheremore true than in Cooney's ace unit. As Viera presents updates on the unit's more familiar cases, Chanand Bercovitch must keep track ofmultiple diagnoses, a litany of testresults and combinations of severalmedications for each patient asthey prepare for their shift.A day in the life By 7:15 on a recent Monday morning, intern Loida Viera, m.d ., and second- year resident Charles Dela Cruz, m.d ., have been working for 24 hoursstraight in ynhh 's new Acute Care for the Elderly ( ace) unit. Viera admitted six patients to the unit dur-ing the night, and she and Dela Cruzare preparing for \"work rounds,\" dur-ing which they will convey all theyknow about the new patients totheir counterparts on their residencyteam, intern Robert Bercovitch, m.d ., and second-year resident FrancisChan, m.d.

For example, the sheersize and complexity of the residency program in internalmedicine, which shepherds 180 residents through 13 clinicalrotations at four different hospitals each year, have requiredpainstaking organizational and educational adjustments. \"The structure of the program at Yale has been built over the last 50 years, and it has been built in pieces, sonobody knew when you changed one piece what the dominoeffect would be,\" says Asghar Rastegar, m.d., professor of medicine (nephrology) and associate chair for academicaffairs. \"This is sort of like a spring cleaning. Every room in the house had to be looked at.\" Institutions that skirt the new rules do so at their own peril. In 2002 the acgme threatened to withdraw accredita- tion of the surgical residency program at Yale for violationsof its previous duty-hours guidelines, and the accreditingboard has come down hard on other elite programs sinceJuly 2003. Residency programs at Johns Hopkins, Duke andthe University of Rochester have been subjected to similar\"adverse actions\" by the acgme . However, just one year after the new rules took effect, Rosemarie L. Fisher, m.d., hs '75, professor of medicine (digestive diseases) and director ofgraduate education at the School of Medicine, says that Yalehas adapted well. According to Peter N. Herbert, m.d. '67, hs'69, chief of staff and senior vice president for medical affairs at ynhh , the close call with the surgical program 's accreditation may have been a blessing in disguise: the crisis led ynhh to take steps over the past two years\u2014the Department of Surgery hired 12 physician assistants tolighten residents' workloads, for example\u2014that put Yaleahead of the curve for compliance. Herbert says that problems arising from the new regu- lations may loom large at the moment, but he is condent thatthe rules will present few difculties for Yale or for graduatemedical education in general in the long run. \"I think all ofthese concerns will be history in two or three years,\" Herbertsays. \"We will nd a way to educate our residents and to givethem all the necessary experiences, in and out of the operatingroom, and at the same time take good care of patients.\" Education or service?

But after just a few seconds ofblessed sleep, the door bursts open\u2014emergency! Cut to ourrudely awakened heroine, who shakes off her drowsiness andrushes off to slay whatever dragon may await. Any doctor knows that the relentlessly action-packed arena of ERonly faintly resembles the everyday practice of medicine ,but the stock character of the sleep-deprived resident is drawn from real life, and has been a familiar gure in hospital hallways for a century. The punishing life of the resident, like many other features of graduate medical education in America, was a product of innovations in medical education made byWilliam Halsted, m.d., a Yale College graduate who founded the vastly influential surgical training program at the JohnsHopkins Hospital during the 1890s. For Halsted, who strongly admired the German medi- cal system of his day, \"residency\" was literal: he requireddoctors in training to live at the hospital, and he discouragedhis charges from marrying to ensure that they gave their all to the profession. His residency system combined therigor of boot camp, the asceticism of the monastery and theesprit de corps of a college fraternity. Senior physicians often speak of this system as if it had been in place since Hippocrates, but as Kenneth M. Ludmerer, m.d., professor of medicine and history at Washington University in St. Louis, says, residency was only one of manypossible routes to medical specialization in Halsted's time,and it did not become the dominant system in graduate medi-cal education until the 1920s. Moreover, says Ludmerer,author of Time to Heal: American Medical Education From the Turn of the Century to the Era of Managed Care ,residency was originally considered a privilege reserved for a few studentswho had demonstrated promise for an academic career, and a high attrition rate was considered a virtue. \"The concept was to start with a broad range of tal- ented individuals, and of those, to select the very best,\" saysRobert Udelsman, m.d., m.b.a ., Lampman Professor of Surgery and Oncology, chair of the Department of Surgeryand chief of surgery at ynhh . This model was known as the \"pyramidal system,\" because fewer residents remainedin a program each year; only those at the top tier survived to become senior or chief residents.33 By 9 a.m., the handoff is com- plete, and Dela Cruz and Chan arefree to attend residents' report, aninformal one-hour exchange of ideasamong the chief resident, attendingphysicians and house staff, whileBercovitch keeps an eye on patientsin the ace unit. Meanwhile, Viera huddles in front of a computer screen in a small ace workroom with McGlynn, using the six postcall hours that remain under Accredita-tion Council for Graduate MedicalEducation ( acgme )rules to completepaperwork and order tests and medications for her patients. At 11 a.m., the four residents and interns are reunited forattending rounds, where Cooneycompresses more than 30 years ofclinical wisdom into a one-hourlecture based on cases of interestin the unit. Today's anecdotes from hishospital experiences and his daysas a volunteer physician at a home-After World War II, several trends converged to \"democratize\" residency, vastly increasing enrollments inresidency programs. An explosion in medical knowledgemade specialization increasingly necessary, and there wasgrowing pressure on faculty at teaching hospitals to provide clinical care while pursuing research. The availabil-ity of more residents to care for patients freed faculty forlaboratory work, and residents took on more responsibilityfor teaching medical students. By the 1950s, grueling 100-hour workweeks had become the norm for residents, but the system was remarkably efcient and cost-effective. AsUdelsman says, residents \"worked like the devil, didn 't com-plain too much and saved hospitals a fortune.\" But according to medical historian Ludmerer, the educational mission of residency suffered greatly as hospi-tals increasingly relied on house staff for clinical care. \"Thedominant theme in the history of graduate medical educa-tion is the ongoing tension between education and service,\"Ludmerer says. Graduate medical education still comesunder re for overemphasizing service and de-emphasizingeducation, a charge leveled since the 1930s, he says. If anything, the devaluing of residents' educational experience has only increased in the era of managed care\u2014patients admitted to the hospital are far sicker and requiremore medical care than inpatients of a generation ago.Moreover, in the face of the recent nursing shortage resi-dents have shouldered duties that have little or no relevance to the education of a physician. Because patient care mustalways take precedence over opportunities to teach medicalstudents, medical school education has suffered as well.Nevertheless, Herbert says, arguments to reform residencyto better meet educational goals have largely fallen on deafears, while the patient-safety crusade that grew out of theZion case ultimately carried the day, leading directly to the acgme 's restrictions on duty hours. Unintended consequences Like military service or athletic competition, enduring the trials of traditional residency has been a source of greatpride and camaraderie for generations of physicians and hasundoubtedly burnished the profession 's mystique in thepublic mind. But whatever its romantic aspects, the intenseschedule of the medical resident had a purely practical ben-et known as \"continuity of care\": by treating newly admit- As the intern who admitted patients overnight, it falls to Viera to present their cases at morning rounds.At 11 a.m. Leo Cooney leads attending rounds, an hour-long discussion of cases of interest from morning rounds. yalemedicine fall/win ter 200 434 Recreating the residency game of \"Telephone\"\u2014information passed from one person to another changes as it moves down the line. Though thepitfalls of handoffs are more subtle than resident fatigue andhave largely escaped the notice of regulators, Rastegar saysthat two studies published in the 1990s in Annals of Internal Medicine and JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association presented convincing and worrisome data to back up Fisher's concern. \"There's a trade-off between arested team and handoffs,\" he says. \"Often handoffs havemore negative impact on patient care than residents whohave worked longer hours.\" Herbert says that some of these problems should diminish over the next three years as ynhh becomes an increasingly \"paperless\" hospital. \"We need exquisitely tightsignoff systems from caregiver to caregiver when we have so many more individuals involved in the care of patients,\"he says. \"The handoff with index cards and paper sheets isstill going on, but there's a lot of effort on computerized formats for doing signout, so any caregiver can go into thecomputerized medical record and see the major concernsand things that need to be followed up in patient care.\" Even as systems are put in place to alleviate proce- dural issues, many faculty worry that the new rules will create a \"shift-worker\" mentality in residents that will erodethe absolute commitment to patient care so esteemed in tra-ditional residency. Reports of residents at other institutionsbeing physically forced to leave hospitals at the momenttheir duty hours end are troubling to those trying to instillabsolute dedication to patients' welfare at Yale. \"Those arethe residents you want to be your doctor when they leave,\"says Leffell, \"because they're the ones who care the most.\" Meeting the challenge Whatever the shortcomings of the new rules, those entrusted with implementing them are convinced that they are here to stay. Instead of greeting the acgme ruling with a grudg- ing passivity, Yale faculty and ynhh administrators have seized the moment to examine the ne structure of the resi-dency system at Yale. Their ultimate aim is not rote compli-ance with the rules, but a reinvention of medical trainingthat meets requirements but exceeds expectations in botheducation and clinical care. For example, surgical volume is sharply up in Udelsman 's department, which has added 22 surgeons toted patients for long, uninterrupted stretches, budding doc- tors could see the natural course of disease and the effects oftreatment unfold in ways no textbook could describe. The new limitations on duty hours inevitably create breaches in continuity of care. Under the acgme rules, residents must leave the hospital when their shift is overregardless of the clinical situation at hand, and the lack of flexibility in this regulation is the greatest source of dissat-isfaction among both faculty and residents. Robert J. Alpern, m.d., the Ensign Professor of Medicine (nephrology) and dean of the School of Medicine,says that \"continuity of care was one of the best parts of theeducational experience. Limiting continuity of care is espe-cially bad for education because you learn about a patientmuch better if you follow them through their whole treat-ment.\" Surgery chair Udelsman agrees. \"I don 't think there'sany question that the residents are sleeping more, are homemore, and I think they basically like that,\" he says. \"There'salso no question that they're not getting as much exposureto patient care as they used to. There's no getting around it.\" The same is true for medical students, whose schedules are tethered to resident teams' shifts, says Herbert S. ChaseJr., m.d., professor of medicine (nephrology) and deputy dean for education at the medical school. \"One learns by observinga patient live the natural history of an illness from beginningto end,\" Chase says. \"In the future, students are going to have to piece together the mosaic of a syndrome; they're onlygoing to see snippets of it. It will never be the same.\" But the advantages of continuity of care are not just educational. Though it might seem obvious that better-restedphysicians will improve patient safety, Rastegar says that rigorous studies on this question in a medical setting aresparse and inconclusive. David J. Leffell, m.d., hs '86, pro- fessor of dermatology and surgery and associate dean forclinical affairs, has similar concerns. \"I don 't know if there'sany evidence that an 80-hour workweek is advantageousapropos risk,\" says Leffell. \"It seems like an arbitrary gure.\" On the other hand, there were some clear advantages to the traditional residency's longer hours. For one thing,longer schedules meant fewer \"handoffs\" of patient historiesand test results from one resident to another when signingout. Fisher used to warn residents to be especially vigilantabout the possibility of medical errors during handoffs,which she says can come perilously close to the children 's 35 the faculty in just the past two years. Because today's hospi- tal patients need a great deal of care, the reduction in resi-dent duty hours has required junior faculty to perform manytasks formerly handled by interns; some assistant professorsare logging in excess of 80 hours a week since the acgme rules were enacted, Udelsman says. His department has hired a dozen physician assis- tants to relieve residents and comply with the rules, butUdelsman suggests that tapping retired surgeons in the NewHaven area would be a creative way to take up even moreclinical slack. \"What a waste to have these people sitting athome doing crossword puzzles when they could be in theoperating room two or three days a week doing what theylove to do,\" he says. \"It could be a win-win situation.\" In the Department of Internal Medicine a hospitalist service has been formed to care for an increasing number ofpatients who cannot be cared for by the medical house staff. When it became clear that restrictions on duty hours were inevitable, Rastegar and his colleagues in the Depart-ment of Internal Medicine began to convene regular meet-ings of residents, chief residents and faculty to take a freshlook at house staff policies. \"There was no blueprint to fol-low,\" says Rastegar. \"We had to develop it locally for our ownhospital, and we knew we wouldn 't get it right the rst time.\" They didn 't. A system in place last year was deemed unworkable and was jettisoned in favor of the current model,which is based on teams of two senior residents and two interns(rst-year residents) under the watchful eye of an attendingphysician. Two medical students are assigned to each team. One resident/intern pair in a team arrives for duty at about 7:30 a.m., working through the night and admittingnew patients until 7:30 the next morning, when the other resi-dent/intern pair arrives. The rst pair is now deemed to be\"postcall\"; according to the new acgme regulations, this pair may hand off patient care to the second team during rounds,but they may not admit new patients and they must refrainfrom any other clinical duties not crucial to continuity of care. After rounds, which start at 7:30 a.m. and last until about 9 a.m., responsibility for the unit's patients is in thenew pair's hands, and with the medical student's help, therst team 's intern completes orders for tests and medica-tions and any other paperwork. The postcall pair are alsopermitted to use any of their remaining six hours for confer-ences or other educational activities.less shelter together with pr\u00e9cis of recent articles on molecularmedicine, and delivers the wholepackage with warmth and humor. After a thorough review of Viera's notes, Dela Cruz attends alunch conference and leaves at 1p.m. On those days when her notesare complete, Viera leaves at noon.She may opt to spend her lunchhour at Fitkin Amphitheater, wherea changing cast of faculty presentintern-friendly lectures on variousclinical concepts.Viera will return at 7:15 the following morning, but for nowChan and Bercovitch have taken the reins. For Asghar Rastegar, m.d ., professor of medicine (nephrol-ogy) and associate chair for academic affairs, the key to pre-serving professionalism and acommitment to patient careunder the new rules lies in a \"cul-tural shift\": residents must beconvinced, he says, that patients'interests will be best served As they prepare to hand off their patients, Wendy Chen and Kathryn Hogan describe theircases to Viera.During breaks between meetings, residents, attendings and internsrepair to a staff room to completetheir notes and order tests andmedications for their patients. At 1 p.m., after a 30-hour shift, the rst pair is of- cially off duty until the next morning's rounds. Each resi-dent/intern pair completes two such shifts per week, andputs in two days' worth of more standard hours to approachthe 80-hour maximum. In the previous model, one resident supervised two interns, who could each admit ve new patients and onepatient transferred from another ward. Though interns canstill admit the same number of patients, having two resi-dents on the team should signicantly improve both patientcare and education, says Cyrus R. Kapadia, m.d., fw '78, professor of medicine (digestive diseases) and director of theresidency training program. \"Now the resident has time toread more about a couple of his or her patients, and tospend more time teaching the intern and the medical stu-dent,\" Kapadia says. The acgme has been unwavering in its enforcement of the 80-hour week, which faculty members say was probably necessary for hospitals to take the ruling seriously.And everyone agrees that they would much rather policetheir own programs in concert with the acgme than submit to auditing by a government agency in the event that federalrestrictions on duty hours were passed. An unexpected gift \"House staff and trainees are probably more conservative than faculty,\" says Fisher. \"They'll tell you all the time thatthey'd love to see change, but when it comes to makingmajor changes, 'Well, maybe you can do it next year, whenI'm gone.'\" Perhaps, but Farshad Abir, m.d., a fth-year adminis- trative chief resident in surgery who completed the rst twoyears of his residency before the new rules took effect, hasno doubt that the acgme -mandated changes are all for the better. \"Just like anything in life, when you start somethingnew you're going to have kinks that need to be ironed out,\"Abir says. \"But I think denitely we're moving in the rightdirection\u2014100 percent. \"The way it used to be was awful,\" says Abir, who regularly logged 120-hour weeks as a junior resident.

'54, hs '55 Are \"bioethicists\" really any wiser? A physician ponders the term and wonders who is qualified to makemedical decisions. Last fall readers of this magazine were invited to present \"thorny professionalsituations\" to a panel of \"bioethicsexperts,\" who would discuss the dilem-mas raised in an article in Yale Medicine (\"Two Alternatives, Each a Little Wrong,\" Spring 2004). In that article,it was noted that the bioethics com-mittee at Yale-New Haven Hospitalincludes \"ethicists\" in addition to doc-tors, nurses, lawyers, social workers,clergy and members of the commu-nity. The initial inquiry, the discussionand the description of the committeeprompted me to ask, what exactly is a \"bioethicist\" anyway? I have served on an ethics commit- tee at the Columbia-PresbyterianMedical Center for more than 20 years,as chair of two institutional reviewboards for 18 and as director of thepsychiatric consultation service in a general hospital for 35. I have beeninvolved in attempts to resolve scoresof ethical dilemmas. Does this qualifyme as a bioethicist? Apparently it does, if I choose to anoint myself asone. And therein lies the problem. In many situations the designation \"bioethicist\" grants individuals author-ity that they did not have the day beforethey assumed that role. In my opinion,studying bioethics as an academic dis-cipline does not provide any specialwisdom in the resolution of a clinicalethical dilemma, and it is wisdom thatis most needed. Before I begin tosound like an academic Neanderthal, I want to make clear that I do believesuch study is useful in identifying thebasic principles that may underlie theseclinical decisions. However, while theability to identify paternalism, bene-cence or autonomy as manifested in aparticular decision may provide someclarity, it does not provide the analystwith any greater sagacity in making it. As a psychiatrist, I am also particu- larly troubled to observe that emotionalconflicts, which are often at the root ofsuch problems, can be ignored in aquest for an overriding ethical principle.Even when emotional conflicts areacknowledged, they are often framedusing a legal/business model requiringnegotiation, mediation or arbitration.The American Society for Bioethics andHumanities includes among its corecompetencies for a clinical ethicist theskills needed to identify the conflict that underlies a need for consultationand the ability to recognize and attendto various relational barriers in com-munication. These skills are not easilyacquired in a classroom or a brief clinical assignment. In the examples presented in the Yale Medicine article, the bioethicists disagreed on an appropriate course ofaction or policy. This is not surprising,since such decisions are ultimatelysubjective and more likely to reflectpersonal beliefs than knowledge. Forexample, in the bioethics textbook Taking Sides: Clashing Views on Contro- versial Issues in Drugs and Society, opposing points of view are expressed on 21 out of 21 issues. At the sympo-sium on clinical ethics at the 2004Yale Medical School Reunion, Robert J.Levine, m.d., hs '63, professor ofmedicine, co-founder of the hospital's ethics committee and a leader in thiseld, stated that a medical decisionshould never rest on the advice of asingle bioethicist, although hearing a pair of ethicists discuss their reason-ing can be illuminating. Therefore, it is particularly worri- some when bioethicists, especiallythose without clinical experience, influ-ence medical decisions. A similar problem, the influence of personal opinion rather than knowledge,also exists in the establishment of gov-ernmental health and research policy. A recent article in The New England Journal of Medicine written by a former member of President Bush 's Council onBioethics describes her experience as apolitically incorrect council member whowas not reappointed, which illustratesthis only too well. Nevertheless, I do believe that the discussion of ethical issues in clinicalmatters and public policy is useful.Scholars of bioethics add an intellec-tual dimension to such deliberationsthat can help participants arrive at useful consensus judgments. However,we should question the basis forattributing superior wisdom to bio-ethicists ,thereby increasing their authority in finding resolutions to\"thorny professional situations.\" Donald S.

As a medical student on an internal medicine rotation, Atul Gawande, m.d., m.p.h ., wasn 't particularly wor- ried about the elderly woman with alow-grade fever who was beingwatched for signs of pneumonia. Shewas one of the last patients he'd coveras a fourth-year student at Harvard,and his mind was on the surgery resi-dency he'd soon begin. After roundingin the morning, he decided not tocheck in again with the patient afterlunch, recalled Gawande, a surgeonand writer for The New Yorker , speak- ing at the School of MedicineCommencement in May. Luckily, the woman 's chief resi- dent was more vigilant. By the timeGawande stopped in to see her, thepatient was gone\u2014gone to the icu in the throes of a rapidly progressing fulminant pneumonia. The lesson, Gawande told the 109 graduates gathered on Harkness Lawn,is that being a physician requires \"aparticular kind of strength. ... Doingthe right thing is often painful, and yetyou nd the way to do it anyway,\" said Gawande, whose essay collection, Complications , was nominated for a 2002 National Book Award. Gawandesaid that physicians must go the extramile for patients, even if doing so is ahassle, even if it's humiliating, eventhough one might make a bad decisionand unintentionally do harm.

They also attend three din-ners with faculty who describe both per-sonal and professional aspects of life as a physician-scientist. Encouragingmedical students to pursue careers asphysician-scientists is the primary goalof the fellowship. Students from anymedical school may apply to study atany of the 10 participating schools.During the past two years two students at Yale have gone elsewhere for research and three students have come to Yale. Presenting at Student Research Day this year was Paul M. Weinberger,from the Medical College of Georgia,who worked with Amanda Psyrri, m.d., fw '02, assistant professor of medicine (medical oncology). \"We are both interested in new molecular therapeutics for cancer andwhy some people with cancer die andothers don 't,\" Weinberger said. \"Youlook at stage 4 patients, and there aresome who 20 years later have no can-cer and they are still alive.

StudentAssociation ( yimsa ), that's something the two are working to change. Originally naming the group the Yale Alternative Medicine StudentAssociation, the handful of studentswho founded it two years ago soonreplaced \"alternative\" with \"integrative\"to reflect their intentions more accu-rately. \"We're not exploring alternativesto our profession,\" said Friedman.\"What we're interested in is having onemedicine that is open-minded and that looks at anything that can possiblyhelp patients.\" Although integrative medicine still has quack status in the minds of somephysicians, the tide is turning. Withresearch programs in major medicalschools across the country investigatingtreatment efcacy, often with fundingfrom the National Center for Comple-mentary and Alternative Medicine at theNational Institutes of Health, the eld is beginning to gain validity. But part ofthe problem, Friedman and Cousin say,is that the denition of these therapies is still nebulous. \"Basically, it's anythingthat isn 't currently taught in medicalschool,\" said Friedman, which meansthat acupuncture is lumped togetherwith crystals, psychic healers and the latest vitamin fad. Still, patients are turning to such treatments with increasing frequency.\"Outside of whether these therapieswork or not,\" said Friedman, \"our rstgoal is to educate students on what'sout there\u2014what kinds of practitionerswe're going to encounter who are treat-ing our patients, and what we need to know about those treatments.\" To that end, yimsa organizes a monthly lecture series at which differ-ent practitioners present not just thebackgrounds of their modalities, butalso what a doctor needs to know about them. The idea, said Margaret A.Drickamer, m.d., associate professor of medicine (geriatrics) and the group'sfaculty advisor, is \"not to destroy alter-native medicine or to promote it, butsimply to look at it. ... They're learning to look at nontraditional medicine, and to see that there are both valueand problems in that.\" The series was well-attended last year, Cousin said, with 20 to 30 stu-dents coming to each talk. This yearCousin and Friedman plan to publi-cize the talks more widely to encouragebroader participation by studentsacross health disciplines. Other eventshave been more interactive. Friedman,who is licensed as a massage practi-tioner in California, organized a six-week medical massage course to runconcurrently with first-year grossanatomy, hoping that massaging eachother will strengthen students' memo-rization of muscle groups. The semes-ter nished with a full day dedicated to a topic universally known to medicalstudents: stress. Students were invitedto experience massage, Reiki, reflex-ology and other therapies during a drop-in health fair. After dinner, yimsa hosted an expert panel, the \"Science of Stress,\" in which doctors and inte-grative medicine practitioners offered a healer's perspective on the biologyand psychology of stress. Ultimately, yimsa 's goal is to change the curriculum to incorporate train-ing in integrative therapies. Progress onthis front has been slow, but Friedmanis trying to build a faculty advisory committee to steer the process. \"Mysense is that there are many individualsamong the faculty who support change,but there hasn 't been any umbrella\" to unite them, she said. \u2014Alla KatsnelsonClinical practice suites open in Harkness Students have a new place to practice patient interviews and physical exams with the opening of seven clinical suites in the base-ment of Harkness Dormitory.

We had some food ghts and we had some disagreements. Theentrees will meet the requirements of Atkins, the South Beach diet andCarboholics Anonymous.\" \"I was planning to stay for lunch until I heard what it was going to be,\"Brownell quipped. \"If it meets all thosecriteria it's going to be awful.\" In a more serious vein, Brownell said that the nation 's obesity crisis hasmany roots. \"Interwoven are complexsocial issues, political beliefs, large-scale economic forces and, of course,science,\" he said. \"What we are find-ing with the approach our govern-ment is taking, as well as the foodindustry's, is that science is becom-ing almost irrelevant.

Participants includedLoretta DiPietro, MarleneB. Schwartz, ph.d . '96, co-director of the Yale Center for Eating and WeightDisorders; and Derek Yach, m.p.h ., rep- resentative of theWorld Health Organization. Luncheon speaker McGinnis of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation( rwjf ) said that the current focus on counting carbs may help mitigateobesity, but it diverts attention fromthe key issues. \"There's no point arguing whether it's fat or carbs thatmatter,\" he said. \"It's both.\" McGinnis laid part of the blame for America's sugar- and starch-ladendiet at his own doorstep. In addition to being the principal architect of the Healthy People process that elevat-ed nutrition on the national agenda, he was a key contributor to the DietaryGuidelines for Americans. The Guide-lines lay out central nutritional con-cepts that still pertain, but when theUnited States Department of Agricul-ture ( usda) developed the accompany- ing food pyramid many people look-ing at recommendations for six to 11daily servings of bread, cereal, rice and pasta failed to distinguish betweensimple and complex carbohydrates. \"We in public health were so happy to have buy-in from the usda , with its sizable food-industry constituency,that the potential for misunderstand-ing when it came to carbohydrates didn 't receive the emphasis it deserved.We meant clearly to focus on high-ber carbs, and the fact is I didn 't payenough attention to how the graphicmight be misrepresented or to theappropriateness of the number of serv-ings,\" McGinnis said. But he added:\"The good news is we have the oppor-tunity now to get it right.\" Getting it right is important, given that Americans consume 150 poundsof sugar a year (compared to 7.5pounds 200 years ago), McGinnis said,adding that diet and activity patternsare now responsible for more than500,000 premature deaths each yearin the United States, ranking at the top of the list of preventable causes ofdeath. Because of the stakes involved,the rwjf has made childhood obesity its top priority. \"The vision,\" he said,\"is not for everyone to be slim.

Lifton, m.d., ph.d ., chair and Sterling Professor of Genetics,speaking at the symposium titled\"Cardiovascular Disease: From Bedsideto Bench and Back Again.\" The rstman, running guru James F. Fixx, diedof a heart attack at 52. The other,Winston Churchill, lived to be 90. Theprobable cause for the difference\u2014genes\u2014is increasingly the subject ofresearch at Yale into the leading causeof death in the United States, said Lifton. Lifton 's research has led him to \"scour the globe\" for families withextreme phenotypes, such as severehypertension, which develops as earlyas adolescence. Lifton and his teamidentify the genetic mutations affectingthe families and show, on the molecu-lar level, how the mutations cause disease. Understanding these mecha-nisms could suggest ways to manipu-late gene products and pathways toght diseases in the general population. Other speakers included Jeffrey R. Bender, m.d., hs '83, the Robert I. Levy Professor of Preventive Cardiology, who discussed the effects of hormonereplacement therapy on vascularinflammation; William C. Sessa, ph.d research on and Stuart D.Katz, m.d., associate professor of medi- cine, who discussed his hypothesis that lower serum iron levels reduce therisk of endothelial disease. The ethics of modern medicine At the Saturday morning symposium four panelists described ethical issuesfacing physicians and society. ThomasP. Duffy, m.d., explored \"how it is that we live our daily lives as physicians.\"Rupali Gandhi, j.d. '00, m.d. '04, discussed rules that protect childrenin clinical trials. Patricia T. Powell, m.d. '87, described the Japanese practice of physicians informing fam-ilies, rather than individuals, of bad news. Philip R. Reilly, m.d. '81, j.d., discussed the impact of the genomic revolution. For Duffy, the image of the physician has taken a beating. The New York Times, he said, was having a eld day with arti- cles about alcoholic practitioners, Botoxqueens of Park Avenue and \"boutique\"doctors catering to the elite. On top ofdepictions of physicians as somethingless than selfless healers, the demandsof practice compete with those of family,and physicians nd themselves involun-tary partners with insurance companiesthat want a say in medical decisions.\"Our profession is a house divided,almost a house conquered. It is time tocome together to reflect on our moraldilemmas,\" Duffy said. Gandhi reviewed the issues con- cerning children as research subjects.In 1789, she noted, Edward Jennermade the questionable decision to testthe worth of cowpox as a smallpox vaccination by inoculating his son.\"Children,\" Gandhi said, \"lack thematurity and the information base tomake a truly informed decision. Theregulations [governing clinical trials]provide children with additional pro-tections because they are a vulnerablegroup. Nevertheless, although regula-tions limit the participation of childrenin research trials, problems\u2014such as ambiguous and inconsistent termi-nology\u2014persist.\" During the four years she lived in Japan, Powell was at rst appalled by from left James Malloy received the Distinguished Alumni Service Award at the public health reunion. Patti Harvey Rose and James Rawlings were inducted into theAlumni Public Service Honor Roll. MichaelMcGinnis, a key contributor to the DietaryGuidelines for Americans, gave the day's luncheon speech. from top Tia Powell, Philip Reilly and Rupali Gandhi were among panelists at the medicalschool reunion who discussed ethical issues fac-ing physicians. Powell described doctor-patientrelations in Japan; Reilly pondered the questionof genetic disorders and the physician's obliga-tion to inform family members who might be atrisk; and Gandhi described the regulations thatprotect children who are research subjects. 50 alumni reunion yale medicine fall/win ter 200 4physicians' reluctance to share bad news with a patient. \"I could not imag-ine any principled reason for notrevealing to patients their diagnoses,\"she said. Yet in Japan physicians are more likely to relay the informationto a family member and, with thepatient's family, invent a ction aboutthe illness and nd a way to continuetreatment. However, a shift is underway and disclosure has become accept-able if the patient is psychologicallystable and capable of making a deci-sion regarding treatment; there aregood relations between the doctor,patient and family; and the patient hasa strong support network. Family relations are also of concern to Reilly, ceo and chair of the board of Interleukin Genetics. If a patienthas a genetic disorder, does the physi-cian have an obligation to inform family members who might also bevulnerable? And how can a physicianinform others without violating patientcondentiality? Pharmacogenetics, headded, \"will change everything aboutpatient care.\" Reilly also worries about genetic testing of fetuses. A survey of preg-nant American women conducted inthe mid-1990s found that many con-sidered gene variants that predisposeto obesity as serious as genetic muta-tions that cause cystic brosis. \"I worryabout a culture that is more interestedin perfection,\" Reilly said. The surgeon as writer Richard A. Selzer, m.d., hs '61, gave up surgery, but he cannot give up writ-ing. \"Once you have become an artistand that third eye of the artist is open,it can never be closed,\" he said.At the ninth annual spring reunion of the Yale Surgical Society, Selzer andfellow writers and surgeons Sherwin B. Nuland, m.d. '55, hs'61, and Bernie S. Siegel, m.d. , hs'61, discussed the paths that led them away from surgery,even while drawing heavily on theirexperiences as physicians. For Siegel, the act of writing was self-preservation as he struggled emo-tionally with death and dying. \"Thetraining we don 't have is: How do youdeal with loss?\" he explained. Hecoped by keeping a journal. Impres-sions grew in complexity and Siegelfound himself writing books. He divided his calendar between medicineand writing until he noticed that hehad colored all his days in surgeryblack\u2014he had come to prefer writing. Nuland's entry into literature was less deliberate. A literary agent askedhim to write a book called How We Die. Nuland declined until it dawned on him that the book would be anopportunity \"to write about my entirecareer, indeed my entire life.\" How We Die was not what the agent envisioned. It was also a surprise tothe author, who uncovered, \"an entirephilosophy about death and dying thatI didn 't know I had.\" Like Selzer, who teaches creative writing to Yale medical and nursingstudents, Nuland believes medicineprovides rich material for literature.\"Please do write,\" Nuland told his col-leagues in the audience, before adding,to laughter, \"but whatever you write,don 't send it to me.\" At a panel sponsored by the Yale Surgical Society, authors and surgeons (top to bottom)Sherwin Nuland, Bernie Siegel and RichardSelzer described how they moved from operating to writing. 51reunion reports 1944 60th reunion Our 60th reunion was like a family holiday gathering. All ofus are in our 80s, and 18 of ouroriginal 42 classmates are alive.Eight were at this reunion, plusseveral wives, and 14 have sentletters and news to our classreunion news journal. This jour-nal is one reason why we havestayed a family for so manyyears. Our class was half the sizeof current classes and every five years we have circulated ajournal with news of everyone,largely from letters to eachother. In earlier years it would be25 pages; five years ago it was 11 pages. Several of us are still inpractice. Bob Frelick is active on the cancer committees of fourhospitals, as well as in adminis-tration, and has received severalawards. He and Jane keep busywith a widely distributed familyof children and grandchildren. Larry Crowley has been dean of the Stanford School of Medicine. Edith Jurka is listed in Who's Who in America and Who's Who in Medicine and Healthcare .Nick Spinelli has been active with the Association of Yale Alumni in Medicine. For years, 100 percent of us donated to the School of Medi-cine. This year it was 72 percentand totaled $74,272. Carol Goldenthal ,Larry Crowley and Nick Spinelli worked on the fund- raising, and we are supplyingscholarships for three currentmedical students. At this year's reunion we enjoyed touring the new Anlyanbuilding. It is amazing that ithas laboratory facilities for 700researchers, huge places forclass anatomy dissections and457,000 square feet of space.We sat together at a table for 12at the Saturday evening dinnerfor 50+ reunion classes, and itprovided the happy time that afamily dinner does. Edith Jurka1949 55th reunion Our 55th reunion was great fun as well as educational. YaleMedical School continues tooffer its students and facultyexciting new opportunities ineducation, research and service.The guided tour of research andteaching labs in the new AnlyanCenter for Medical Research andEducation showed us not onlythe huge investment in bricksand mortar Yale is making, butalso some of the innovativeapproaches to student teachingintroduced in this new facility.In this regard, we were pleasedto see that the truly innovativeYale System of Medical Educa-tion is thriving. At the annualmeeting of the Association ofYale Alumni in Medicine weheard presentations by two stu-dents (Sharon Gill and JessicaYager) who had taken time offto carry out research/serviceprojects, one in Africa, and wereastounded that roughly half theclass now takes such an addi-tional year off in order to pursuea particular interest. In our time,only about 10 percent did. One of our classmates, Frank Dana Law , died earlier this year, so our number now stands at31. Eight attended the reunion,most with their wives: Bill Anlyan , Bud Baldwin (still hard at work for the ama ),Bill Bevis and Dorothy, Dan Elliott and Betty, Paul Goldstein and Betty, Jack Miller and Anne, Julian Pichel and Cecile, and Larry Shulman and Reni. Few of our classmates arestill working full time, but Hal Holman does, at Stanford. A few still work part time, but mostare actively retired. Gordon Jensen has just finished writing another book, his first novel. Carl Russell is busy with his oil paint- ing and watercolors. He attendspainting workshops in placeslike Chattanooga, Sedona andTaos, where he fancies a golfcourse nearby. It is at 9,000 feetand facilitates long drives! Nora Gordon Baird continues her translations of ancient Greekclassics. Nora skipped thereunion in order to attend the high school graduation of one ofher five grandchildren. The luncheon and wonderful clambake at Harkness providedopportunities to chat with oldfriends from other classes aswell as our own. Breakfast in theBeaumont room held a specialsignificance for Jack and Anne Miller , who held their wedding reception there 50 years ago.Dinner at the Graduate Club hadto await the running of theBelmont. The disappointmentof the enthusiastic supporters ofSmarty Jones when he lost inthe last few seconds was quicklyerased by the animated conver-sations that accompanied awonderful meal. Jack Miller 1954 50th reunion The Class of 1954 celebrated the 50th anniversary of our gradu-ation. An outstanding reunioncelebration was planned andsupervised by our local arrange-ments committee: Frank Gruskay (chair), Tony Piccirillo and Lowell Olson . A reunion record was set, as 33 classmates were present.Adding to the success was the50th Reunion Album, edited by Bob Hatch and Harry Miller ;Kitty Halloran ,Dick Pullen and Don Davis contributed. Eva Henriksen 's diary of her four years at ysm formed the framework for the chronology of the event. The exhibition cases in the Ogilvie Lobby are filled withbooks written by Freeman , Hustead ,Kornfeld ,Lamb ,Miller and Nora , members of the Class of '54, donated as a permanentcollection. Also shown was amontage of memorabilia fromthe dedication ceremony nam-ing the laboratory at theUniversity of California, SanDiego, the Nicholas A. Halasz , m.d ., Student Laboratory. On Thursday, early arrivals attended a \"Pizza and Beer\" yale medicine fall/win ter 200 452 alumni reunion reports party, where the rebonding began. Friday we attended gen-eral reunion events, followed by the clambake. Sam Hunter played the grand piano in Harkness Hall for us and all the alumni\u2014over the soundsystem. Sam was terrific. On Saturday we took advantage ofthe cme program, the ayam annual meeting and the tradi- tional sherry luncheon atHarkness Hall. On Saturday evening we were honored at the \"Friends ofthe 50th\" dinner at the GraduateClub. After dinner we observeda moment of silence for thoseno longer with us. Special men-tion was made of those whodied since our last reunion \u2014 Nick Halasz ,Paul Neufeld and Lowell Olson . Bob Hatch and Harry Miller were thanked for the superb reunion album. They rated astanding ovation. Of 61 graduates, 33 attended the reunion. This (73 percentof surviving classmates) sets arecord for attendance at a 50threunion. Most members of the class and their spouses haveretired from practice and aretraveling for pleasure, visitingchildren/grandchildren andoccupying themselves with vol-unteer work and hobbies. Theseinclude George and Mary Bostwick ,Richard and Cleone Bouchard ,John and Cynthia Cole , Don and Jeanne Davis ,Jack and Elaine Gariepy ,Kitty Halloran , Bob and Mary Hatch ,Walker and Sylvia Heap ,Sam and Lynn Hunter ,Eva Henriksen ,Bob and Joy Hustead ,Lowell and Shirley Kristensen ,Richard and Doris Lamb ,Harry and Kari Miller ,Jim and Audrey Nora ,Dick and Barbara Pullen ,Jacques Quen , and Jack and Jo Ann Vosskuhler . George and Myra Bowers enjoyed the reunion so much they promised to return. Alan Covey , who came with wife Sylvia ,remains in part-time practice with their son on LongIsland. Artand Janet Crovatto have happily returned to York, Pa., and continue to summer onMartha's Vineyard. Mike andJeanne DeNicola attended the Saturday luncheon but missedthe banquet. Fred Fiederlein attended with his son. Fred has retired from his neurology prac-tice, where he specialized in thediagnosis and treatment ofheadaches. Dick Foster returned to our fold\u2014he graduated in1955 but is affiliated with ourclass. He retired from an ob/gynpractice in upstate New York. Walter Freeman and Do were energetically involved in a dis-cussion of medical politics. Orlando and Denise Gabriele returned for a pleasant week- end. The department of radiol-ogy at the University of WestVirginia has been named forhim. He is said to be fabulous.Denise was a former resident. Frank and Bette Gruskay com- mute between New Haven andWatch Hill, R.I. Kudos to themfor arranging our reunion. Don Kornfeld continues to report to the College of Physicians andSurgeons at Columbia, where he was once acting dean andrumored to be outstanding. Herb Lubs and Dr. Betty Lou Lubs have tied the knot\u2014congratulationsand good luck. Tony and Jeanne Piccirillo are living at the Masonic Home in Wallingford. Theyattended the luncheon but didnot return for dinner. Lenand Gail Silverman have found Ponce de Leon's fountain. Len looks younger than he did in 1954.Barbara Olson and daughtersKristi and Kari represented Lowell , who had worked hard as a mem- ber of the reunion arrangementscommittee, and died just beforethe reunion. Erika Hurwitzattended in her husband's place.She is doing well. Two classmates cancelled because of emergency medicalproblems. Bob Keith had an operation and Bob Joy spent the weekend in the intensive careunit of his hospital. Both arerecovering well. Marty Vita hadfamily obligations that precluded attendance. Lee Hilburg can- celled. Ralph Campbell 's grand- daughter was being married during the weekend. Eli Schimmel sent his regards to all\u2014but he could not attend. Mano Shirodkar intended to come, but was advised by his physician not totravel. He sent a letter, a tape and a review of his work in virol-ogy for our class records. We'll meet again in 2009\u2014 maybe sooner if there is demand. Finally, we must thank Harry Miller for his leadership in establishing the medical school'snewest endowed class scholar-ship fund. The effort began fiveyears ago and the participationof 75 percent of the class hasmade it a success. Arthur C. Crovatto 1959 45th reunion Two score and five years after graduation the Class of '59 gathered to celebrate theadvances in medicine, such asartificial joints, improved dietsand the cardiovascular benefitsof shuffleboard, that made ourattendance possible. Friday nightat Dave and Joan Reed 's mega- home there was a silver sea ofgray heads with a few shiningdomes bobbing up in theirmidst, all gathered around thelobster pot. A debate ragedamong our chronologically gifted group on the pros andcons of retirement. The advo-cates, led by Herb Kaufmann , held that even if you win the ratrace, you are still a rat, while thecons discussed \"phased retire-ment\" and elder mentoring. Ace Barnes pointed out that being antiquated is an asset in somethird-world countries. Mimi Wolf and Bob Amick 's wife Carol con- tinued discussing artificial joints,both anticipating hip replace-ment soon ( Mimi by Kris Keggi the following week). Saturday night Nick Passarelli arranged for us to enjoy the imaginative productions ofworld-class chefs as well as theair conditioning at the New 53 Haven Lawn Club. (Remember the heat wave of '94?) It wasreally cool\u2014and tasty. Bob Fisher announced that contributions of the Class of '59 were outstand-ing during this past reunion year.Our class contributed $93,623 in gifts and pledges to theSchool, and our class scholar-ship fund now has a marketvalue of $364,594. Bob is now a High Poobah at the AlumniGiving office. Nick reported that we had broken the record at 72 percentattendance and he brought usup to date, not unkindly, onsome of the nonattendees. Thenthe band struck up a tango andwe danced away a beautifulevening. All of us were pleased that two special ladies, Ellie Skinner( Dave ) and Bunny Prokop ( Jim) attended. Bill Heydorn did not attend because of the recentdeath of Joan. First-time atten-dees . Others present were Bob Amick ,Frank Beer ,Jack Bowers ,Ed Clayton ,Sid Cohen ,Bud Dawson , Ron De Conti ,Gerry Fenichel ,Bob Gonyea ,Gerry Gordon ,Ron Morris , Jack Poglinco ,Joe Saccio ,Mark Schwartz ,Dick Senfield ,Sandy Solomon and Jim Stagnone . See you in '09! Asa Barnes 1964 40th reunion Our 40th gala at New Haven's Polo Grille had spirit and reason-able number as 15 classmates andnine spouses returned to Yale. Bob and Becky Mitchell traveled from northern Califor- nia, where he still practices car-diovascular surgery. Lew (dean at Northwestern) and Jill Landsberg flew in from Chicago en route to Nice, France. Skip and Joyce Stilp from Wisconsin appeared to bemore than enjoying retirement. Other Wisconsonites included Bill and Mary Alice (m.d . '66) Houghton . Their daughter, Shelagh , was Class of '98. Stan and Maxine Rosenberg came down from Boston and providedfree antacids. Steve and Gillian Waltman from St. Louis punctu- ated the evening with subtleone-liners and critical ecopoliti-cal wisdom. Tom and Claire Cardella added a nice Washington, D.C., touch. Remo and Christiane Fabbri , psychiatrist extraordi- naire and lay minister, were theonly locals. Class treasurer Bob and Wendy Lyons had flowchart and charge card machine in hand. Mary Digangi and Diane Shrier , while not discussing mentalhealth issues, debated thevirtues of comfortable fashionsand long-stemmed footwear. Tony Bravo looked the picture of health and wealth and willsomeday be the fourth greattenor. Bob Briggs had brief lapses of memory and reaffirmed thatfantasies have no boundaries. Tom Lentz , presently associate dean of admissions, concludedthat we were most fortunate tohave applied to Yale MedicalSchool in 1960 and not later. Joseph F.J. Curi 1969 35th reunion The oysters, corn fritters, huge shrimp and liquid refreshmentcompensated a bit for the chill of Friday night as we greeted Arnie and Nancy Mazur and Jody Robinson . We then moved into the warmth of the old Harknessdining room and joined the 1969table filled with Ellen and Len Milstone , the Lionel Nelson s,Sandy Genser ,Steve and Lyn Krant ,John and Patty Kelly ,Rob and Joanne Marier ,Larry and Sally Yeatman , and Jonelle Carey Rowe . The Saturday morning ethics seminar was well-received. Wewere joined at lunch by Joel and Janet Kaufman ,Lee Jampol , and David Schulak and his fianc\u00e9e. We moved on to the historicBeaumont Room for a specialmemorial discussion of David Barry , whose achievements we celebrated in 1999. We watchedsome very touching and illumi-nating portions of David 's memo- rial service from Chapel Hill,kindly provided by Gracia Barry. We then discussed how we might memorialize David , as well as John Meehan and Eric Otobo , who also left us far too early. Asmall group agreed to work on anappropriate memorial process fordeparted class members. The evening at the Quinni- piack Club brought Chuck and Sandra Angell ,Tom Ciesielski , the Robert Gordons ,Stephen Webb and Ralph Falkenstein . The class photograph had to be delayedas we watched Smarty Joneslose his attempt at the TripleCrown. Rob Marier and the devel- opment office provided memo-ries of lost youth with 1965entrance photographs and a1969 class photo in front of theBrady building. We did our traditional \"lam- pooning\" of all absent class-mates, which should inspirethem to attend future reunionsto defend their reputations. Our gathering appears to expand reunion by reunion.Nearing or passing 60 certainlydoes bring on a good deal ofreflection. Several classmateswho hadn't returned to NewHaven since 1969 found it par-ticularly enjoyable to be back.We all found that the opportu-nity to remember and reflectwith classmates gave us arenewed vision to carry back toour professional and personallives. We look forward to 2009. Leo M. Cooney Jr . 1974 30th reunion Our reunion weekend flew by too quickly. We participated inprovocative symposia and toursof the campus, but the high-lights were two great dinners yale medicine fall/win ter 200 454 alumni reunion reports with lots of shared memories and time to catch up. We sawpeople we had not seen in 30years. Both nights we stayeduntil closing and we all felt wecould have stayed longer. Early birds were treated to a symposium on obesity presentedby the Department of Epidemi-ology and Public Health. KellyBrownell, professor and chair ofthe Department of Psychologyand director of the Yale Center for Eating and Weight Disorders,told us that obesity results asmuch from societal pressures and national policies as from per-sonal failures. Friday night my wife, Cheryl, son David (age 20) and daughterJulia (age 11) joined me at theNew England clambake, wherewe found Dahlia Kirkpatrick ,Tony Demorizi and son Eliseo (junior in college), Ralph Binder and wife Barbara, and Rob Kolodner .Ralph is practicing pulmonary medi- cine in New Rochelle, N.Y. He hascontinued his world travels,including backpacking trips tothe Amazon and Alaska. Rob is the acting chief informationofficer for the Veterans HealthAdministration. At our lastreunion Rob had told me that he was working on a project thatwas going to \"change the waywe all practice medicine.\" Heelaborated this year by showingus the VA's electronic chartingsystem that will revolutionizethe way medicine is practiced.Both Tony and Dahlia have had hard luck with medical prob-lems. Tony uses a wheelchair because of a spinal cord prob-lem of unknown origin that isstill being investigated. Tony commented that he was \"so impressed and happy to findthat the warmth of old friends isstill there after so many years.\" Dahlia has been a bone marrow transplant specialist at SloanKettering and Tulane MedicalSchool. She has had problemswith multiple hip replacementsand has changed her practice tophysical medicine for the timebeing. Dahlia spent most of her professional life in academicmedicine and she misses con-tact with students. She encour- ages young graduates to go into academic medicine becausementoring students is sorewarding. Those of us who toured the new Anlyan Center were awed bythe combination of beautifularchitecture, huge size and mod-ern lab facilities. The studentanatomy rooms are quite differ-ent from the dissecting rooms ofour time. Each station has touch-sensitive screens showing theanatomy in rich colorful detail. At Zinc Restaurant I talked with Irvand Marina Asher .Irvis practicing neurology with a spe-cialty in movement disorder, inColumbia, Mo. We shared ourmemories of working in the labsat Connecticut Mental HealthCenter. Len and Liz Banco came down from Hartford, where Len is professor of pediatrics at the University of Connecticut Schoolof Medicine and vice presidentof strategy and regional devel-opment at ConnecticutChildren's Medical Center. Len noted, \"When not doing medi- cine my hobbies include collect-ing rare books (early Americanhistory), traveling and enjoyingwine and food. The reunion atZinc was a lot of fun; the dinnerwas excellent, as was the con-versation. I only wish that moreclassmates would attend thenext reunion.\" In addition topracticing pulmonary medicinein Basking Ridge, N.J., Harvey Gerhard has written scientific articles and three novels, includ-ing the bestselling medicalthriller The Donors .Harvey is married and has two children inhigh school. Our conversation at Zinc was filled with warmth, laughter andsurprisingly close feelings. Whilewe had not seen each other for30 years, we had a history offour intense years together and,as Ralph noted, a very strong bond because of our sharedexperiences in medicine. Whilewe live in different places and practice different specialties, wehad many things in common.We reminisced and shared ourlife's experiences, good and bad.We talked about career choices,politics (right, left and middlewere represented), managedcare, family, malpractice. Mostof us have been victimized byfrivolous lawsuits. We agreedthat the best solution to themalpractice crisis is a no-faultsystem for patients combinedwith an educationally focusedprogram for doctors. Whensomeone asked, \"Would youwant your child to be a doctor?\"our group was evenly split. Several classmates who were not able to attend wrote me: Carol Teitz is professor of orthopaedics at the University ofWashington in Seattle. She couldnot attend the reunion becauseshe was going to Asia with threetraveling fellows from theAmerican Orthopaedic Societyfor Sports Medicine. Carol wrote, \"I remarried in 2000 to CraigKeebler, who is a bariatric medi-cine physician (not surgical). Mytwins are almost 21. One is atStanford and one is at U. Miami.Craig has a 25-year-old marrieddaughter (and we have onegrandchild), another daughterwho is 22 and here at UW and ason, 19, who is spending a yearstudying in Israel before startinguniversity. It's pretty noisy wheneveryone is home!\" Jerry Orlin sends regards from the Hasharon Hospital BloodBank in Petah Tiqwa, Israel. Dave Collier has recently returned from an adventure serving aschief of nuclear medicine at theKuwait University MedicalSchool where, prior to the IraqWar, he lectured on nuclear ter-rorism. Dave Ritvo is practicing psychoanalysis in the Bay Area. Ross Tonkens almost made it to the reunion but had to travel to Helsinki for business. He isthe director of medical and sci-entific services and global scien-tific head of the cardiovasculartherapeutics division at Quintiles. Paul David lives outside Boston with his wife and three children 55 (ages 21, 17, 13). Paul worked for 15 years at Beth Israel Hospitalon the psychiatry consultationservice and in the ER and ran themedical student clerkship. He isnow in full-time private practice . Ron Neumann sends his best wishes to everyone from Mary-land. He is head of the nuclearmedicine department at the nih, where he does research on dna damage and repair follow- ing radionuclide treatment ofcancers. He notes that he stilllunches with his wife after 25years. She is the head of the surgical pathology group in the pathology branch of theNational Cancer Institute. Amy Starr sends her best wishes from Los Angeles, where she is a pediatrician. Her daughter is a sophomore at Yale, in thesame college as my son. The reunion was a great time. Mark your calendars nowand plan to come to the 35th! Doug Berv 1979 25th reunion A very small group of the Class of '79 gathered for the clambakeon the Harkness lawn on Fridaynight, including Lloyd Friedman , vice president of medical affairs(pulmonary diseases), MilfordHospital (Conn.), with his wife,Kai Yang, and kids (one of whomwas braving an abscessed tooth!); Jeff Dornbusch ,picu Presbyterian Hospital, and immunology), HarvardMedical School; Cindy Sherman , gastroenterologist, , associate pro- fessor (biomedical informatics),Vanderbilt University MedicalCenter, Nashville, and his wife,Patty, joined us briefly, thoughthey had to leave before theSaturday festivities, because Ed'sband had a gig in Washington,D.C. They are apparently muchsought after at medical gather-ings to get the dancing going\u2014 maybe next reunion? Our dinner on Saturday was in the library of the GraduateClub, where the group from thenight before was expanded toinclude a respectable dozen orso of our classmates, including Kerry Cooper , nephrology, Scotts- Ariz.; Bonnie AlbertEinstein College of Medicine,Jacobi Medical Center, New York; Dave Golan , biological chemistry, Harvard Medical School; Jonathan Holt , consultation, liaison, (psychiatry), University at Buffalo-Department of Psychiatry, suny - Buffalo, N.Y., and his wife, Karen; Liz Moore , the cancer cen- ter at West Virginia University(oncology-internal medicine)and his wife, Meenakshi; myhusband, Alan Plattus, and me,as well as Jeff,Mike ,Cindy and Lloyd from the night before. Shirley McCarthy , professor of radiology at Yale, sent her regrets,having been called away on afamily emergency. Lynn Rudich , pediatrics, Woodbridge, Conn.,and her husband, Alan Klein-man, made a surprise appear-ance during dessert and coffee. We lingered over cocktails and then had a class picture takenbefore moving on to dinner. Weall clustered around a board withour first-year \"mug shots\"\u2014andagreed that none of us hadchanged a bit! Conversation waslively, catching up on our lives,children and the past, recent orupcoming college searches forthe next generation. It was a veryrelaxed and enjoyable evening,and we hope to garner a biggercrowd next time. Nancy Berliner 1984 20th reunion Our class dinner was held at Peter Glazer 's (therapeutic radiology at Yale) and my(molecular biophysics and bio-chemistry, Yale) house inGuilford. The weather was cold and rainy for June, so webrought the tables inside and lit a fire in the fireplace. Wewere joined by David (ent,N e w Haven) and Karen Astrachan ; Lenny (founder of biotech com- pany, Alexion, in Cheshire, Conn.)and Linda Bell and two of their children; Jan Blustein (health policy, nyu ) and Leslie Greengard; Joe Chambers (cardi- ology) and Barbara Coda (anes- thesia), who are living inOregon; Rich (AstraZeneca in Delaware) and Sara Leff; and Paul Rothman and Frances Meyer and their three children. Paul is at Columbia University but ismoving to the University ofIowa this summer to be chair ofmedicine. John Krystal (psychia- try, Yale) and Bonnie Becker andtheir twins attended, and Mark Stein (urology in New York) and Andy Sternlicht (antibiotic bio- tech in Boston) were there. Ken Rosenblum has a new undertak- ing: machines that dispense pre-scriptions in doctors' offices(I nstyMeds ). Look for them. On Friday night at the clam- bake we were joined by Dave Shrier , who is in diagnostic imaging at Rochester, and Josh Schor , who is the medical direc- tor of a Jewish nursing home inNew Jersey. Michael Caplan , who is in the physiology departmentat Yale, and Marnin Merrick , who is a radiation oncologist in NewYork City, also joined us. I wasvery happy that our son, Sam,kept himself occupied playingfootball in front of Harknesswith David and Karen Astrachan 's two very congenial boys. Several of our classmates sent their regrets: Aron and Peggy Wahrman had a baby in May, Hope Francesca, and socould not come; Ana and Dan Kolansky had a family matter to attend to; Bruce Haffty (thera- peutic radiology, Yale) Gutner was tak- 56 alumni reunion reportsyale medicine fall/win ter 200 4ing her children to Europe and so could not attend. All of us greatly missed our friend and classmate, Sabra Jones , who died in a rock climb- ing accident since our lastreunion. Susan Baserga 1989 15th reunion The reunion was very disap- pointing\u2014of a class of morethan 100 people, many of whomlive in the tri-state area, onlythree showed up. Besides me,there was Anita Licata (formerly Anita Goodrich ), who came down from Vermont, and Dora Wang , who came all the way from NewMexico. It was nice to see Anita and Dora again (they were at the 10th reunion as well). Anita is married to Tom Licata and is a dermatologist at theUniversity of Vermont. They havetwo children, Thomas and Isabel. Dora came with her husband, Chris Calott, who is an architectin New Mexico, and their newbaby. Dora is a psychiatrist at the University of New Mexico and iswriting a book. As for me, I am a neurologist at the College of Physicians andSurgeons, Columbia University,where I recently received tenure.I spend about 80 percent of my time in research and 20 per-cent seeing patients with move-ment disorders, and have builta research program on the epi-demiology, genetics and patho-physiology of tremor disorders.In my spare time, I play the bag-pipes with the Kearny Pipe band(we wear the MacBeth kilt),and have recently begun show-ing some of my artwork (pas-tels) and had my first solo showin Manhattan in October. I ammarried ( Vinita '90) and have Devinand Ravi, ages 8 and 6, and welive in Westchester. I would loveto hear from old friends. My e-mail is edl2@columbia.edu. Elan Louis 1994 10th reunion It is hard to imagine that 10 years have already passed sincewe left (OK, since most of usleft) en masse from New Haven.To celebrate the occasion, astrong contingent from theClass of 1994 gathered in NewHaven to reminisce. Constantino Pena , positioning himself at the top stair in the Starr Atrium ofthe newly built Anlyan Center(can you believe the new anato-my labs are ventilated so thatfirst-years don't constantly smellof formaldehyde?), offered a bighearty welcoming wave to allclassmates as they entered theopening reception. Tino ,a n interventional radiologist inFlorida, traveled solo to NewHaven. His two daughtersstayed home with wife Barbara( m.d . '95), an ER doc, who is expecting their third this fall. Tino has been in touch with Jae Lim, who is a neurosurgeon in Spokane, Wash. Other classmates attending the Friday evening clambakeincluded Victoria Holloway , assistant vice president of R&D,L Marsha Roberts a California-based radiologist;and Marie Eason .Marsha and Marie , unfortunately, could not stay for Saturday, as they hadmore social calls to make in theD.C. area. Also traveling fromCalifornia was Kirk Essenmacher , port-folio, his wife, Kirsten, and their11-month-old daughter Stella. Kirk reports news from Joetta (Davis) Maier and Alexa (Boer) Kimball , neither of whom could make the trip east, and from Dov Goldstein , who is back in Philadelphia as the cfo of Vicuron Pharmaceuticals. Kirk , who still makes his famousdaiquiris, is not sure of the proper method for puttingkumquats in the beverage. Kevin (Bishoff) Carlson and Nancy Christmas , each with a baby in tow, carpooled upfrom D.C. Kevin is an internist- geriatrician in Maryland and has three kids all under the ageof 5. Still as energetic as ever,she left many of us thinking \"I don't know how she does it.\" Nancy is a retinal surgeon in Alexandria, Va. My daughters,after playing with Nancy 's son Abbott, started lobbying for anew baby brother. Len Landesberg arrived Saturday in time for the sherryluncheon where he, Tino and Kirk finally concluded that, after 10 years, they still looked thesame (and very different fromthe other luncheoners whomostly hailed from classes inthe 1960s). The Saturday evening class dinner was held at my house inGuilford, Conn. Interestingly, wehad more children in attendancethan adults. Debbie Schussheim , her husband, Adam, and theirtwo children drove up fromWestport, Conn., where Debbie practices endocrinology. Belinda Chan arrived with her two boys, who very quickly bonded withmy son, Noah. Kudos to Belinda , who recently went into a solointernal medicine practice andhung her shingle in Branford,Conn. Kirk Essenmacher ,Nancy Christmas and their families completed the dinner crowd. Many other classmates sent me e-mail offering their regretsfor not being able to attend. Melissa Berhow just started a new anesthesiology position inPalo Alto. Scott Dessain , a proud dad to two lovely daughters, isan assistant professor of hema-tology at Thomas JeffersonMedical College and conductsresearch to develop fully human 57 monoclonal antibodies. Beverly Naiman and Brian Lee live with their two boys in Virginia, where Bev is a pediatric ER physician and Brian is a critical-care physi- cian who is double-boarded inER as well. Bandy Lee is back in New Haven as an assistant clini-cal professor of psychiatry atYale. Greg Licholai does venture capital investing and speaks regularly with Stephen Jackman . Dave Aghassi is practicing der- matology in Boston. I look forward to seeing everyone back in New Haven forour 15th year celebration in June 2009! Bonnie E. Gould Rothberg 1999 5th reunion After five years away from New Haven, the Class of 1999gathered once again on the Yale campus for our firstreunion. While there are a fewthings that have changed, it wasnice to see some old standbys(Bar, Louis' Lunch) and somefriendly faces from the past (EricSchonewald is still there!). Our class gathered on Friday evening, amidst an endlessspread of fantastic seafood andthe sounds of Dixieland music in the background. Our groupincluded Ken Baum and his wife, Julie. Ken is practicing law in New Haven and Julie is a fifth-year medical student at Yale,planning a career in dermatol-ogy. They plan on finally leaving New Haven in one year, whenJulie begins her residency. Deborah Steinbaum also joined us.Deb is practicing general pediatrics at Mount SinaiHospital in New York City. Alison Days came with her husband, Sergio. Alison is practicing aca- demic pediatrics in El Paso,Texas. Our group also included Sherri Sandifer ,Debby Lin ,Obi Ugwonali and Joy Weinberg . Sherri is practicing general in a second-year immunology fellowat Brigham and Women'sHospital in Boston. Obi is finish- ing an orthopaedics residency atColumbia-Presbyterian Hospital in New York, and will be movingto Boston next year for a hand/shoulder fellowship at Brighamand Women's Hospital. Joy is finishing an internal medicineresidency at North Shore Medi-cal Center and plans on doing a fellowship in nephrology andhypertension at Lenox HillHospital in New York City. On Saturday evening, we gathered at the Graduate Club,the site of our last evening out-ing as a class back in 1999. Wehad a great turnout, with closeto 20 class members present(and had our own \"kiddie\" roomset aside by the AlumniAssociation, to keep us separatefrom the rowdy Class of 1954).We were joined by Lifei Guo , who is in the midst of a residency inplastic surgery in Boston. Deanna Chin and her husband, John (married in September 2003),also attended. Deanna is finish- ing her fourth year of a radiol-ogy residency at Weill-CornellMedical Center and will bedoing an mri fellowship at nyu next year. Also present were Kathryn Cunningham ,Ara Feinstein ,Andrew Resnick ,Aaron Milstone ,Zach Leitze ,Johnathan Henderson , and Grey Maher and her husband, Aaron. Kathryn is practicing internal medicine atMass General. Ara is in a general surgery residency at Mass Generaland is spending his research yearsgetting an m.p.h .from the University of Miami. Andy , who is finishing a general surgery resi-dency at UPenn, is spending hisresearch years getting an m.b.a . from Wharton. Aaron finished his pediatric residency at Children'sHospital of Philadelphia ( chop ), and is currently working in a private practice for one year,before moving on to Baltimoreto do a fellowship in infectiousdisease at Johns Hopkins. Hiswife, Amy, who got her medicaldegree at Yale in 2000, is now a chief resident at chop , and is expecting their first baby. Zach is at Yale-New Haven Hospitaldoing orthopaedics. He is plan-ning to move to Texas nextyear to do a fellowship in hand/shoulder surgery. Johnathan is in private practice at DorchesterHouse Community HealthCenter in Boston. His wife, Keba,is finishing her ob/gyn residencyin Boston this year, after whichthey will be moving to Atlanta. Johnathan and Keba are expect- ing their first baby as well. Grey is currently doing a chief resi- dency year in urology at the VAhospital in West Haven, andthen plans on doing a femalepelvic reconstructive surgery fel-lowship in California next year.After that, she plans on return-ing to New Haven and joining aprivate practice group. Lastly, Iam in the middle of a fellow-ship in pediatric hematology-oncology at Boston Children'sHospital/Dana- Farber CancerInstitute, and recently marriedas well. We had a fantastic time remi- niscing about all of our class-mates, and look forward to doingit again in another five years.

Ask a political psychologist How one medical school graduate's \"career in the shadows\" began withan unexpected job offer. In 1965, the ciapresented an unusual job opportunity to the young psychia-trist, then completing his residency atthe National Institute of Mental Health,that was enticing enough for him toturn down a faculty position at Harvard. Asked to develop a pilot program for what he described as \"assessing at adistance the personality and politicalbehavior of foreign leaders,\" Jerrold M. Post, m.d. '60, decided this diversion justied delaying a trip into academia.Little did he suspect in 1965 that someof the world's most important leadersDuring what he calls his 21-year \"career in the shadows,\" Post probedthe pathologies and personalities ofsome of the world's most dangerousminds. He continued to develop politi-cal personality proles after joining thefaculty at George WashingtonUniversity in Washington, where he isprofessor of psychiatry, political psy-chology and international affairs anddirector of the political psychology pro-gram. Among the contemporary lead-ers he has proled are SlobodanMilosevic, North Korea's Kim Jong-Il,Osama bin Laden and, most famously,Saddam Hussein. His analysis of theIraqi leader was presented in testi-mony in December 1990 to the HouseArmed Services and Foreign Affairscommittees. Post's intimate knowledgeof the Iraqi leader was called uponagain by national media in March2003, when war with Iraq began, andagain last December, when the Iraqileader was captured. \"No worse beginning is imaginable,\" Post says of the dictator's formativeyears. \"His father and 12-year-oldbrother died during his mother's preg-nancy. She tried to kill herself and thentried to abort Saddam. She wouldn 'teven look at him when he was born ina mud hut in Tikrit.\" According to Post, Saddam was passed off to an uncle, who took careof him, then returned him to hismother after she'd remarried. His step-father abused him physically and psychologically. But when he was eight,wanting an education that his parentsrefused, he went back to his uncle,who lled his head with dreams ofglory. \" As he accumulated power,\" Post says, \"Saddam created these mar-velous palaces, and yet they all hadenormous bunkers down below, likethe deant paranoid self beneath his grandiose fa\u00e7ade. When he wascaptured in Tikrit, he wasn 't just backin the mud hut. He was in a holeunderneath the mud hut, as low asanyone could go, representingSaddam 's shattered self.\" would soon be stretched out on his ana- lyst's couch\u2014guratively speaking\u2014and that his ciaside trip would last until 1986. As founding director of the Center for the Analysis of Personality andPolitical Behavior ( cappb ) at the cia, Post led an interdisciplinary behavioralscience unit composed of clinical andresearch psychiatrists, social psycholo-gists, political sociologists, anthropolo-gists and political scientists. Their jobwas to develop political personality pro-les of foreign leaders. \"We looked at foreign leaders in their cultural and political context andgauged to what degree they were play-ing out personal conflicts on an inter-national stage,\" says Post, who today isfrequently quoted on television and innewspapers and magazines. During 21 years at the cia, psychiatrist Jerrold Post developed personal and political profiles of world leaders, including Saddam Hussein,Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat, as well asal-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. scott suchm an59 Among Post's proudest ciaachieve- ments were the proleshis unit prepared of Menachem Beginand Anwar Sadat for President Carterin 1978. Using these assessments, the president was able to ready himselffor that groundbreaking summit. Inhis book, Keeping Faith (1982), Carter acknowledged that these analysesinfluenced his negotiating strategy andpaid rich dividends. \" After Camp David, there was scarcely a major summit without ourbeing asked to prepare proles andassessments of the foreign leaders,\"Post says. \"Part of my pride was incrafting an entirely new eld of intelli-gence at the cia.\" Post was awarded the Intelligence Medal of Merit in 1979. Since leaving the cia in 1986, Post has established himself as an expert on\"the mind of the terrorist,\" which is, infact, the title of the book he's currentlywriting. In addition to consulting forthe departments of defense and home-land security, Post was an expert wit-ness at the 1997 trial of an Abu Nidaloperative and the July 2001 trial of anal-Qaeda member for the bombing ofthe U.S. embassy in Tanzania. He is the author of several widely cited books, including When Illness Strikes the Leader (Yale University Press, 1993) and Leaders and Their Followers in a Dangerous World (Cornell University Press, 2004). Post is often quoted onmatters related to Saddam Hussein,Osama bin Laden and the psychologyof suicide terrorism. \"I have always seen my role, in gov- ernment and outside it, as communi-cating complicated concepts in a waythat is useful for intelligence profes-sionals, policy ofcials and the generalpublic,\" says Post. \"I'm not alwaysreassuring, but I am trying to facilitateunderstanding.\" \u2014Alan BisbortLooking to mechanics to explain what cells do and how they develop Mavericks start out young, it seems. Once, after performing an advancedearth science experiment with otherninth-graders, Donald E. Ingber , m.d. ph.d . result. \"I wrote down 12,\" he says,\"even though they all wrote down 88.\"The instructors informed the class thatthere were indeed two correct answers,but that among the few students whohad discovered the less obvious solu-tion, only one\u2014Ingber\u2014hadn 'tscratched it out in favor of the morepopular result. \"That was incredible feedback from a teacher,\" Ingber says, \"for people todo what they believe in and what theythink is right.\" Ingber has found this message use- ful in the years since as he forged anoften-controversial career. While mostcell biologists use molecular techniquesto tease out the genes at work in healthand disease, Ingber, now the JudahFolkman Professor of Vascular Biologyat Harvard Medical School andChildren 's Hospital in Boston, haschampioned the more radical notionthat minute mechanical forces actingon cells\u2014pushing and pulling, com-pression and tension\u2014are crucial totheir normal growth and function, andthat disturbances in these forces canlead to disease. \"I'm a person who has always had a strong sense of how things work by looking at them,\" Ingber says. \"I'mvery mechanically minded.\" Ingber'smechanical bent led to an early fasci-nation with the work of anotherrugged individualist, R. Buckminster Fuller, in particular the concept of\"tensegrity,\" the complementary inter-play of compression and tension thatunderlies the elegance and strength ofFuller's geodesic domes. While a Yale undergraduate, Ingber encountered in an art class the sculp-tures of Kenneth Snelson, in whichpipes and wires, intricately arrangedaccording to principles of tensegrity,create airy yet rigid forms that riseimprobably into space. For Ingber, whowas doing tissue culture experimentson metastasis with Alan ph.d ., in the Department of Pharma- cology at the time, Snelson 's pipes and wires called to mind the actin la-ments and microtubules that make upthe cytoskeleton\u2014the internal scaffold-ing of the cell. Seeing Snelson 's work had the force of a revelation, Ingber says. \"Ispent multiple two-week vacations inevery library at Yale\u2014the art library,the chemistry library, the physicslibrary,\" he says. \"I bought every bookin Atticus Bookstore related to tensilemembranes or patterns in nature.\" Ingber gradually became convinced that mechanical forces, largely ignoredsince the rise of molecular biology,must play crucial roles in the develop-ment and behavior of cells. However,when he suggested to a postdoctoralfellow that cells might change theirshape because of changes in tensegrity,he received a less than encouragingresponse. \"He told me, ever saythat again!'\" Ingber But Ingber isn 't one to give up easi- ly. As a graduate student in Yale's m.d./ph.d . Program, he sought out a more hospitable environment for hisyale medicine fall/win ter 200 460 alumni faces ideas, which he found in the laboratory of James D. Jamieson, m.d., ph.d ., professor of cell biology and director of the program. With Jamieson 's bless-ing, Ingber devoted a chapter of histhesis to tensegrity, and he is particu-larly grateful that one of his thesisadvisors, the pioneering cell biologistand Nobel laureate George E. Palade, m.d., entertained his unconventional views with an open mind. \"Instead of laughing, he gave me BuckminsterFuller's book Synergetics , which he had received as a gift when he won theNobel,\" Ingber says. When it came time for his resi- dency, Ingber made the decision tostop his medical training to doresearch in the laboratory of M. JudahFolkman, m.d., at Children 's Hospital in Boston. No stranger to controversy,Folkman has fought his own long andlonely battle to prove his theory thatblocking angiogenesis\u2014the body'srecruitment of new blood vessels\u2014isthe key to treating cancer and a host of other diseases. Shortly after Ingber joined the Folkman lab, a fungus contaminated a tissue culture experiment he wasworking on. Before pitching his dishesinto the trash, Ingber decided to seewhether the fungus had any noteworthyeffects on the endothelial cells thatwere being used in the studies. It wasa wise decision: the cells had retractedaway from the fungus, and Ingber surmised that the fungus was secretingsome substance that inhibited theirgrowth. To Folkman 's delight, Ingberhad happened upon a substance thatled to the development of tnp-470, one of the most promising angiogen-esis inhibitors ever discovered. tnp-470 showed potent antitumor activity, but it was shelved when Phase II trials revealed serious neurotoxicity.However, a young scientist now working in Folkman 's lab has recentlymodied the compound, and Ingber'schance discovery may yet nd its wayinto the clinic. In a lab at Children 's Hospital where Ingber continues his study oftensegrity, the walls are lined withframed micrographs of such stunningbeauty that they could hang in theupscale galleries of nearby Back Bay.In one, cells cultured on a surfacedesigned to constrain various forces on the cytoskeleton have assumed a number of brilliant shapes, includingmultihued squares and lozenges reminiscent of Paul Klee. Ingber believes he has nally homed in on the interface betweenphysical forces and cell physiology.Many regulatory and signaling mol-ecules cluster on the cell membranearound proteins called integrins, whichanchor the cytoskeleton of cells to theextracellular matrix. In recent work,using miniscule magnetic beads thatlock onto like a molecularwrench, has shown that twist-ing integrins in different ways causesdistinctive shape changes in thecytoskeleton, which in turn cause pre-dictable patterns of gene expression.He also can switch cells betweengrowth, death and differentiation byvarying the degree to which cells physi-cally distort when bound to a matrixthrough integrins. To investigate these processes more deeply, Ingber has developed a femto-second laser technique along withHarvard physicist Eric Mazur, ph.d .,that will allow him to perform highly selective nanosurgery on cells. Ingbersays that the ability to obliterate somestructures while retaining cells' overallfunction will open completely newavenues to test his theories. Ingber is condent that the rigor of his experimental work will eventuallyovercome the skepticism he has longfaced, and that his ideas will slowly but surely enter the mainstream of cellbiology. \" A couple of big Science and Nature papers convinced a hell of a lot of people,\" he says. \"In science, even if it's a wild idea, if other people startusing it and nd it valuable\u2014if of tensegrity\u2014the interplay of compression and tension underlying structures\u2014to the study of cell biology.kris tin gu lla ge61 Familiar Faces Do you have a colleague who is making a difference in medicine or public health or has followed an unusual pathsince leaving Yale?

'84, j.d. his studies at the School ofMedicine in 1978, fresh from a RhodesScholarship at Oxford, he \"wanderedaround,\" he says, liberally samplingthe range of courses Yale had to offer,particularly in public health and law.Brennan already had a strong interestin policy research, and he found theclasses at the Law School to be so stimulating that he donned a secondhat during his second year of medicalschool and became a law student as well. But while Brennan still believes that his immersion in the world of lawhas been invaluable in his career as a policy-maker, he never doubted thathe would spend his working life as aphysician. \"I always knew I'd practicemedicine, not practice law,\" he says.\"I've never taken a bar exam.\" Lawyering is too solitary for Brennan, who prefers the social andintellectual give-and-take of medicine.\"The practice of law is pretty isolating,whereas medicine's just the opposite\u2014it's always dealing with people,\" saysBrennan, now professor of medicine atHarvard Medical School and professorof law and public health at the HarvardSchool of Public Health. \"It's muchmore interpersonally satisfying.\" So it's no surprise that Brennan chose a very public way of doctoring. Hehas been front-and-center in nationaldebates on health care policy for twodecades; his research group now focuseson the interwoven issues of improvingpatient safety and addressing the crisis in medical malpractice. \"Until very recently, the major way in which our health care system dealt withdeterring medical injuries and improv-ing safety was through medical malprac-tice. That was the social mechanism,\"Brennan says. \"We think those shouldbe torn apart, and that patient safetyshould be addressed through an entirelydifferent mechanism.\" Brennan argues that both doctors and patients would be far better offwith an administrative compensationscheme or mandatory arbitration ofclaims of medical injury. He envisionsa system similar to Workers' Compen-sation, where an administrative-lawjudge would render verdicts afteradvice from experts and with the helpof specically dened criteria on howavoidable a given patient's injurieswere under present standards of care.Any damages would be awardedaccording to strict guidelines. As it stands, state common law gov- erning medical injury claims is apatchwork of wildly varying standardsand precedents. A few states\u2014Nevada,Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas andIllinois, for example\u2014are malpracticehotspots where skyrocketing insurancepremiums are leading to a shortage ofspecialists. The American MedicalAssociation has said that as many as20 other states are also in \"malpracticecrisis.\" And Brennan says that 50 to60 percent of insurance premiumsnow pay attorneys' fees rather thancompensating patients who have beeninjured in avoidable medical accidents. Brennan also endorses a greater embrace of \"enterprise liability,\" wherehospitals, rather than individual doc-tors, are held liable when accidents occur. \"In plane crashes, it's not likeeverybody goes and sues the pilot,\" hesays. \"They sue the airline, because it'sa big enterprise. The pilot's part of it,but he's got to be informed by the sys-tems and processes that are going tomake that flight safe. A doctor in ahospital is part of a much larger sys-tem, and that system 's got to functionwell to prevent these types of injuriesin the future.\" Brennan says that the simple substi- tution of \"avoidable\" for \"negligent\"under his scheme would represent amajor cultural shift away from the sim-mering cauldron of the malpracticecourtroom. When we cast all medicalaccidents, even some that may have beenunavoidable, in terms of negligence, hesays, doctors are loathe to come forwardwhen they have made an error. \"If doctors could say, 'This was an avoidable injury, and we should goahead and report this,' Brennan says,\"they don 't have to feel as thoughthey're involved in some sort of moralPassion Play.\" \u2014P.F.When we cast all medical accidents ... in terms of negligence, doctors areloathe to come forward.\"\"yale medicine fall/win ter 200 462 alumni notes 1940s Morris A.

Since the mid-1970s about 15 students each yearhave enjoyed a rare opportunity in medical school\u2014thechance to see the same patient over and over again\u2014andlearned how to manage long-term clinical care. Working underthe supervision of attending physicians, medical studentsinterview patients, conduct physical exams, make diagnosesand recommend treatment. For G. Morris Dillard, m.d., ph.d ., who founded the clinic, the clinic's value is not in the information that studentsacquire, but the ability to think clinically. \"It is the logical reasoning with the material you have at hand that is the most important thing the clinic can accom-plish,\" he said. The clinic serves as an example of how to expose stu- dents to long-term clinical experiences at a time when themedical school is exploring ways to teach universal, asopposed to discipline-specific, skills. \"There is an interest in alongitudinal experience,\" said Herbert S. Chase Jr., m.d., deputy dean for education. \"To that extent, the Wednesday EveningClinic was really a pioneer.\" Kathleen P . White, m.d., the clinic's director, said the clinic has seen a few changes in recent years. Spanish-speaking first- and second-year students are on hand to interpret for patients. Undergraduates interested in medicineprovide clerical support. Four more attending physicians havejoined the roster of volunteers, and the clinic has recruitedcommunity doctors. Clinic files are now computerized so pre-ceptors can review student notes on their cases online. And this year, said White, two students found long-term preceptorships outside the clinic, in reproductive gynecologyand vascular surgery. \"They got longitudinal experience intheir interests,\" White said. \u2014John Curtisjanuary 1954 Alumni Bulletin Wanted: for General Reading \"A small bookplate indicating own- ership of the Yale Medical Libraryand bearing the tag from Marital's[sic] Epigrams,'Those books theypraise, but these they read' is usedin a collection of books that havenothing to do with medicine\u2014notonly volumes classified as 'lightreading' but also books in otherfields of endeavor which representgood general reading.

At the medical school Dean Robert J. Alpern, m.d. , and others described medical education at Yale and in the United States.(In China students go straight from secondary school to medicalschool.) The visitors also toured research laboratories and teach-ing laboratories and classrooms for histology and anatomy. Yale began a series of educational exchanges with Chinese universities in 1996, and earlier this year Yale concluded an agree-ment with Fudan University in Shanghai to promote exchangesamong scholars in history, East Asian languages and literature,genetics, biology, law, medicine and management. \"Will this visit cause changes to be made?\" asked Tian Xu, p.h.d. '90, professor and vice chair of genetics at Yale and special advisor to President Richard C. Levin on science and highereducation in China. \"Definitely. It's a question of how much and how fast.\" terry d agradiChinese University leaders listen as Lawrence Rizzolo, associate professor of surgery (anatomy), gives a tour of new teaching facilities in the Anlyan Center.Below, the chop designed for the China-YaleAdvanced University Leadership Program. yale medicine p.o. haven ct 06519-0612 "}
