Each student must meet minimum criteria for fitness to practice. These criteria include, but are not limited to, physic al ability and stamina, mental preparation and clarity of thought, absence of distractions and absence of influence of substances of impairment. Prior to being permitted to attend a clinical experience, the student's information will be shared with the ap plicable clinical partner. The fol lowing requirements must be met and maintained in a Castle Branch account accessible by the College of Nursing staff. Your file must contain up to date copies of the following documents prior to being permitted to attend clinical experiences. Students who upload fraudulent items will be dismissed from the program. Stude nts with incomplete files will not be permitted to attend clinical experiences and are therefore at risk for clinical course failure and program dismissal. College of Nursing Student Health Form (Must be updated annually) Proof of immunizations required by the College of Nursing. TB screening - PPD, T spot blood test and/or Chest X -Ray (Must be completed annually ) Confidentiality/Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Course Completion American Heart A ssociation Basic Life Support (CPR) Certification Cleared Criminal and Drug Use Background screen (Comp leted upon admission to program.) o Recurring self- certification of clear criminal and drug u se background each semester o Repeated screenings as required by program administration (Completed at the student's expense.) Proof of personal health insurance Mask (N95) FIT Testing (required for all upon CON entry, and may be asked to complete annually depending on clinical affiliate requirements ) Additional agency requirements as required (i.e. agency specific education/orientation, Influenza vaccination, COVID attestation etc.) College of Nursin g Student Acknowledgement Forms (completed within L EAP*RN) o Student Handbook Attestation Form o Confidentiality Agreement o Consent to Photograph and/or Video Record Health Insurance Portability & Accountability Act The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, referred to hereafter as HIPAA, was established to provide national standards for privacy and confidentiality of all health data and the transmission of health data electronically. The University of Central Florida, College of Nursing has identified itself as a business partner for healthcare organizations and healthcare providers. In accordance with this designation, we are required to abide by HIPAA regulations and provide or verify that education on HIPAA has been given to students who are enrolled in our programs. HIPAA education needs to be completed before a student is allowed to start a clinical/practicum with a healthcare organization or a healthcare provider. 4 | Page 3/1/202 2 Background Checks - Traditional & Accelerated Programs Students admitted to the UCF College of Nursing pre -license programs were cleared of having a criminal history that would prevent placement in a clinical setting or obtaining a license as a Professional Registered Nurse. Such status must be maintained throughout the student's participation in the BSN program. The College of Nursing reserves the right to require a repeat screening of any student for criminal history and drug use. Such screenings will be at the student's expense and conducted by the agency of choice of the College of Nursing. If a student is arrested for any offense after admission to the College of Nursing, the student must notify, in writing , the Program Director within 72 hours of the arrest. Failure to do so will result in immediate dismissal upon discovery of the non -disclosure. Only c ertain criminal offences may result in the student being disqualified from being eligible to continue in their program of study. Such disqualifying events are based on, but not limited to, Florida Statute 435.04. Prior to entering a clinical placement, eac h student must file an affidavit of non -arrest with the appropriate Program Assistant. Falsifying this affidavit will result in immediate dismissal from the program upon discovery of the falsification. If the student is arrested for an offense that is a disqualifying event, the student will not be placed in a clinical setting. If currently in a clinical rotation, the student will be removed. Academic progression will be suspended pending support of a continuance petition from the student to the UAPG Committee. Additionally, a final decision for placement permission from potential clinical agencies with whom the student could be placed must be obtained. If a clinical site cannot be obtained, the student will be determined to be uneducable for initial licensu re as a Registered Professional Nurse and therefore dismissed from the program of study. If the offense prevents the student from being eligible for initial licensure as a Registered Professional Nurse within the program completion timeframes listed in this handbook, the student will be dismissed from the program of study. Student Arrest Procedure a. Students must report an arrest to the appropriate Program Director within 72 hours of the arrest. b. In the event a student discloses they have been arrested to a f aculty member and not the Program Director, the faculty member must report the arrest to the appropriate Program Director immediately. c. The Program Director must document in writing the events as relayed to them and submit an incident report to OSC (Offic e of Student Conduct) d. The student must submit a copy of the arrest report within 5 days to the Program Director. e. The student will be required to complete a new background check at the cost of the student within the timeframe of 30 and 45 days after the arrest. f. The Program Director will determine if arrest is a disqualifying event based on the clinical agency affiliation agreements. g. If the arrest is a disqualifying event, the student will be prohibited from continuing with clinical courses until clinical facilities have reviewed the arrest record and agreed to continued clinical placement. i. If the clinical agency is unable to allow clinical education to occur at their facility, the student may be dismissed from the program. 5 | Page 3/1/202 2 h. Depending on the arrest, the stude nt may be required to submit final disposition before enrolling in future semesters or graduating. i. If the University pursues a student conduct hearing, the student will be held to all sanctions including any suspensions as a result. LEAP*RN The College of Nursing uses a student information management system, LEAP*RN (Project Concert). This database houses information regarding plans of study, clinical placements, clinical hours, logs, and evaluation data to assist in maintaining standards require d for CCNE accreditation, facilitate student progression, and enhance clinical tracking. Students will need to access LEAP*RN for clinical course requirements, course evaluations, and portfolios. Upon graduation, students will continue to have no - cost acce ss to their information. All students will be responsible for a one -time subscription of $150 per degree program payable at https://secure.projectconcert.com/ucf and due prior to registering for first semester courses. If students register for courses prio r to paying the subscription, a \"hold\" service indicator will be placed to prevent future enrollment and other progression functions. Clinical Credit Hours 1 credit course = 45 contact hours in clinical area Simulation contact hours count 2:1 for clinical hours (Ex: 4 simulation hours = 8 clinical hours) Clinical Accountability Nurses are morally and legally obligated to protect the safety, privacy, and security of clients. To meet this standard, nurses and students must be academically prepared, mentally s table and physically fit. In addition to the progression standards below, students must alert the appropriate member of the faculty regarding any acute change in their physical ability to care for clients. This includes conditions that may limit the clinic al experience for the student such as pregnancy. If you are pregnant or have suffered a recent alteration in health, it may be necessary to preclude you from caring for clients in certain settings. For example, a pregnant student must not enter areas using radioactive materials or equipment. Likewise, a student with an impaired immune system should not care for persons with communicable disease. The Undergraduate Clinical Coordinator must be made aware of any situation or health condition that may impact t he care of clients. Clinical Experience Expectations Each student is expected to meet the following minimum standards of nursing practice. Failure to meet minimum expectations may result in course failure. Professionalism 1. Dress a. See professional appearance requirements for participation in clinical rotations located in the student handbook and specific course syllabi. b. For functions where the nursing uniform is not appropriate or required, professional dress matching the standards of the event location are ex pected. 2. Social Interaction a. Respect for faculty, classmates, facility staff and clients must always be displayed. Respect will be demonstrated by maintaining polite and professional behavior at all times. 6 | Page 3/1/202 2 b. A professional manner of speech is the minimum expectation. i. Refrain from using slang and/or colloquialisms that do not en hance therapeutic communication. ii. Profanity of any kind in any setting will not be tolerated. c. Use of personal communication devices must be pre -approved by both the Clinical Instructor and the clinical agency. i. At no point may the use of such a device interrupt patient care or give the perception of unprofessionalism. ii. Personal phone calls /text messages are not permitted when in client areas or during times when the student is responsible for clinical activities. This includes wearing a 'smart watch', as these are prohibited during clinicals. iii. When approved by the Clinical Instructor, devices may be used to communicate only with that Clinical Instructor or Preceptor. Preparation 1. Clinical Experiences a. Timely submission of all required paperwork to participate in clinical. b. Submission of written clinical assignments when due as directed by the Clinical Instructor. 2. Skills preparation a. Skills must be learned and reviewed prior to being p erformed in the clinical setting. b. The student may not perform any skill in the clinical setting without the knowledge and consent of the Clinical Instructor or Preceptor. i. Faculty members reserve the right to ask for a demonstration of any skill at any time in any educational or clinical setting. ii. In the event that such demonstrations are substandard, a skills prescription form may be issued to the student for remediation in the nursing lab. iii. Satisfactory mastery of a remediated skill must be demonstrated prio r to returning to the clinical area. 3. Medication Calculation Exams a. Medication calculation exam s may be administered prior to a clinical rotation start. 100% grade is required to pass medication within that rotation . Up to 3 attempts allowed. Subsequent retests must be administered on a different day th an the prior test completed. Attendance Expectations 1. Attendance to clinical experiences is mandatory. 2. Arrival at the clinical site no later than the appointed time is mandatory. a. Students arriv ing late (more than 5 minutes) , but prior to the beginning of pre -clinical conference may complete the clinical day at the discretion of the Clinical Instructor. b. Students arriving after the beginning of pre -clinical conference will not be permitted to comp lete the clinical day and must leave the clinical setting. This will result in an unsatisfactory grade for the day. i. If eligible, the student must attend a make- up day as scheduled by the Undergraduate Clinical Coordinator. ii. If not eligible for a make -up day , the absence will result in a clinical course failure. 7 | Page 3/1/202 2 c. Not showing up for a clinical day without advising the Clinical Instructor immediately is considered unprofessional behavior . i. Any instance will result in corrective action(s) as determined by the Unde rgraduate Internship Experiences Coordinator (Clinical Coordinator) before the student may return to the clinical area. ii. Subsequent instances at any time during the BSN program may result in program dismissal. Clinical Make -Up Days 1. Eligibility for clinical make -up is determined on an individual basis by the Undergraduate Internship Experiences Coordinator (Clinical Coordinator). 2. A Virtual Clinical assignment may be used in place of attending a live clinical make up day. The student will be responsible for any additional cost of the software product. The assigned simulation experiences and due dates will be determined by the Undergraduate Internship Experiences Coordinator (Clinical Coordinator) . 3. Simulation is considered On -Campus Clinical (OCC) and will require make -up per policy , if missed . Determination of Safe Practice 1. The Clinical Instructor, in consultation with the Program Director/ Campus Coordinator an d/or the Undergraduate Internship Experie nces Coordinator (Clinical Coordinator) , has the responsibility to determine the ability and willingness of a student to perform safe and efficient client care at the level appropriate to the specific clinical rotation. 2. Students must be able to perform pre paratory tasks as assigned in the clinical setting. This includes, but is not limited to, chart reviews, procedural reviews prior to client care delivery and facility policy reviews to assure compliance with evidence -based practices for safe client care. 3. Students must be able to safely meet the needs of clients. a. Students who are unable to complete client care in a reasonable amount of time will be evaluated by the Clinical Instructor, Program Director/ Campus Coordinator and/or the Undergraduate Internship E xperiences Coordinator (Clinical Coordinator) to determine if they are sufficiently compet ent to provide safe client care. b. In the event that the Clinical Instructor deems a student to be practicing unsafely, the level of unsafe practice will be determined and documented in the student's record. Standards of safety are based on the clinical evaluation criteria for that specific clinical rotation. i. Students may be immediately remediated to assure safe clinical practice at the discretion of the Clinical Instructor, Program Director/Campus Coordinator and/ or the Undergraduate Internship Experiences Coordinator (Clinical Coordinator) . ii. Students may be immediately dismissed from the clinical area at the discretion of the Clinical Instructor, Program Director/ Campus Coordinator and/ or the Undergraduate Internship Experiences Coordinator (Clinical Coordinator) . iii. At the request of the clinical agency's representative, a student will be immediately dismissed from the clinical area. In such cases, all identification badges must be surrendered to the Clinical Instructor immediately. Such a dismissal will require program administration and agency review of the incident prior to the student's return to the clinical setting. a) Such incidents may result in dismissal of the student from the BSN program. 8 | Page 3/1/202 2 4. Nurses regularly care for patients with potentially communicable diseases, including COVID -19. As such, they are trained in patient care management and wearing of personal protective equipment (PPE). Students enrolled in cl inical courses under the supervision of a faculty member and/or preceptor may be assigned to care for patients, including those with COVID. They may require to be fit tested with either Halyard N95 masks or 3M 1860 N95 masks; know their mask, model, and a size to ensure safety; and follow all policies/procedures at the clinical site for patient care and PPE. Clinical Observation Experiences 1. Observation experiences are considered to be clinical experiences , and may be included within a clinical rotation although they are not required. 2. No direct patient/client care is to be rendered by the student in an observational experience. This includes restrictions from administering any medications or directly participating in any invasive procedures (ex: PI V insertion s). However, in order to gain the greatest learning experience, students must prepare in advance. Asking the appropriate, enlightened questions of the staff and clientele will enhance the experience as will appropriate requests to be present at all activities relevant to the objectives for the experience. Course/Clinical Enrollment 1. Students enrolled in clinical courses must maintain enrollment in all program courses each semester. a. Select semesters in the BSN program contain more than one clinical c ourse with staged beginnings and endings during the regular semester. They may be scheduled sequentially or concurrently. b. In the event that a clinical course is completed unsatisfactorily as a result of unsafe practice, the student will not be permitted to attend any other clinical rotations associated with another course during that semester. i. If the clinical course for which the student earns the grade of Unsatisfactory (U) is completed prior to the Withdrawal date established by the University, the studen t may elect to either accept the grade or withdraw from the course. ii. The student may either withdraw from subsequent clinical courses according to University Withdrawal policy and procedure or petition the Office o f the Registrar for a Late Drop. c. If a stud ent withdraws from a didactic course that has a co -requisite clinical course, the student must withdraw from the clinical course if that clinical rotation has not been completed at the time of the didactic course withdrawal. d. Failure to maintain proper course enrollment , per plan of study, requires the student to file an Undergraduate Petition to request program continuation. i. Deliberations on student petitions to continue in the BSN program will review student performance data as documented by Instructors an d Program Administrators for the purpose of committee decision making. Professional Appearance (Traditional and Accelerated Students Only) 9 | Page 3/1/202 2 Dress and Identification All students should be dressed professionally when in the clinical setting, clinical orientations, in on-campus labs and clinical, and at all professional meetings. The UCF College of Nursing photo identification is worn during all clinically associated activities. Additional identification badges and uniform requirements may be r equired by the clinical agency. Students are expected to comply with dress code policies of the clinical agency as it related to College of Nursing students. Students must return all hospital badges prior to graduation or when they leave the program. It is NOT acceptable for students to wear either their student name bad ge or their UCF uniform/clinical jacket while in the agency at any other time (i.e., in the role of employee, volunteer, visitor) or in public social situations ( ex: at a party ). It is NOT a cceptable for students to wear uniforms from their other areas of employment at College of Nursing clinical, on -campus labs or other related situations. Uniforms are required for all clinical experiences including circumstances that require virtual clinicals . Your instructor will advise you if a uniform is not required for an event or clinical. All students are expected to comply with the policies of the agency at which they are doing their clinical work. Student Nurse Uniform A clean , stain free and wrinkle -free official UCF uniform is required at all clinical settings , orientations, labs, and simulation. This applies as well to circumstances in which virtual clinicals orientations, labs, simulation, or clinical meetings occur. The official uniform must be purchased from the official College of Nursing uniform vendor. Program Administration must approve alterations to the uniform to accommodate unique student needs, such as religious requirements, prior to clinical attendance (ex: skirt vs pants). It is recommended the student purchase two tops, two pair of pants , one gray polo and one lab coat. The shirt is worn un -tucked and over the pants. The top of the pants is not to be rolled. A white or black camisole , undershirt , or long sleeve shirt may be worn under the uniform top. Non -UCF uniform outerwear such as jackets or sweatshirts are not permitted once inside the clinical or laboratory settings. Rather the student may wear the approved UCF warm -up jacket within the clinical setting. Students are to wear the uniform while in the nursing student role only. Shoes Shoes must be made of leather, be all black in color, sturdy, low -heeled, and enclose d toe/heel with non -marking soles. Athletic shoes are acceptable. Shoes must be clean and in good repair.

The UCF College of Nursing photo identification is worn at all times. During psychiatric -mental health nursing experiences and occasional Community Nursing activities, students may be required to wear business attire and shoes. These instances will be at the discretion of the instructor on an individual basis. In keeping with the intent of the promotion of professionalism and identification as UCF nursing students, business attire wi th the uniform jacket will be the norm. (Clinical instructors will provide additional information as relevant to the clinical agency). If you are unsure of what dress requirement is required for your clinical experience, consult your instructor. Grooming Nails o Smooth and clean.

Visible chest hair must be covered by under shirt Smoking As nurses, it is important to be role models in health promotion. Smoking is not acceptable when in uniform. In addition, the smell of smoke on clothing and hair may be offensive, especially to clients who are ill. Clothing and hair that retain smoke odors are not acceptable in the clinical setting. The University of Central Florida prohibits smoking on all university owned, operated, leased, and/or controlled properties in order to maintain a healthy and safe environment for its faculty, staff, students, and visitors. Smoking is also not permitted on any of the hospital and other agency properties. Miscellaneous Perfumes, colog nes, after- shave or scented fabric soaps/softeners are not allowed. Chewing gum during clinical and on -campus labs is not permitted. Body Substance Exposure Policy Every effort is made by the faculty to avoid dangerous situations in the clinical setting, but risks are ever present during nursing procedures. Students should use universal precautions and safety measures to prevent the likelihood of these types of injury. Definitions 1. Blood or Other Potentially Infectious Material a. The following human body fluids: semen, vaginal secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, pleural fluid, pericardial fluid, peritoneal fluid, amniotic fluid, saliva in dental procedures, any body fluid that is visibly contaminated with blood, and all body fluids in situations where it is difficult or impossible to differentiate between body fluids; b. Any unfixed tissue or organ (other than intact skin) from a human (living or dead); and c. HIV-containing cell or tissue cultures, organ cultures, and HIV or HBV -containing cul tures medium or other solution; and blood, organs, or other tissues from experimental animals infected with HIV or HBV. 2. Body Fluid Exposure is any exposure to non -intact skin or mucous membranes by body fluids that are infected or potentially infected by b lood borne pathogens. Most common exposures in the healthcare setting ranked from highest to lowest risk of transmitting disease are: a. Needle sticks, cuts b. Prolonged exposure to non -intact skin including open wounds, abrasions, chapped hands, dermatitis c. Splashes to eyes or mouth d. Bites: more at risk for bacterial pathogens from the skin surface than HIV or HBV. 3. Significant Exposure is defined as an exposure to blood/body fluids of source patient by percutaneous injury, exposure or mucous membranes, chapped or broken skin of the healthcare worker. These include: 12 | Page 3/1/202 2 a. Deep injury b. Visible blood on device c. Procedure involving needle pla ced directly in a vein or artery d. Terminal illness in source patient 4. Source is an individual or object comes in contact with a healthcare worker in such a way that an exposure incident has occurred during the course of work -related duties. 5. Unknown Source is a source determined to be unknown only after reasonable attempts have been made to locate and investigate the source. A so urce can also be declared unknown for treatment reasons if there is not sufficient time to investigate the source before the at- risk incubation period ends. Management 1. First actions upon injury a. Puncture wound: i. Bleed wound and wash with soap and water b. Eyes or mucous membranes: i. Immediately flush with copious amounts of water c. Other body surfaces: i. Wash with soap and water 2. Notify instructor/preceptor at once. (Medical follow -up must begin within four (4) hours of the incident). The instructor/preceptor will comm unicate with the Undergraduate Internship Experiences Coordinator (Clinical Coordinator) . 3. Complete an Incident Report Form to document any Blood/Body Fluid exposure. 4. Identify the source patient/object and risk status of source patient if possible. 5. Students will seek care at the institution where the incident occurred. The institution where the incident occurred is responsible for making arrangements and absorbing the costs of any lab work or treatment incurred. UCF Student Health Services may administer follow -up care for the student after receiving approval from the institution. 6. If the incident occurs in the community, the student may be seen at UCF Student Health Services. All charges for lab testing and medications are at the expense o f the exposed student. Full -time students may be seen at the UCF Student Health Services for free but will incur costs for labs an d medications. M ost major medical insurances are accepted. Students also have the option of seeking care at their primary care provider. Payment for services rendered is the responsibility of the student. 7. Personal Health Insurance coverage is required as part of the student's enrollment in clinical . Professional Equipment Students are expected to have basic equipment for clien t care during lab and clinical experiences. Necessary equipment includes a professional bell and diaphragm stethoscope, bandage scissors, watch with sweep second hand, penlight, and a pen with black ink. Bandage scissors are not allowed on pediatric units. 13 | Page 3/1/202 2 Transportation Students are individually responsible for arranging their own transportation to clinical sites and experiences. Absence from class or scheduled clinical experiences due to transportation problems is not acceptable. Carpool arrangements will not be part of the decision -making process when clinical assignments are made. Attendance of Professional Conferences, Symposia & Meetings Involvement in professional gatherings is an expectation of the professional registered nurse. As such, the College of Nursing is in support of students attending such events. Often, the college sponsors such events. However, students cannot sacrifice valu able learning experiences such as clinical experience, simulation activities and class meetings in order to attend them. The College of Nursing makes every effort to allow for such events. But it is not possible to allow for all of them. In the event of a scheduling conflict, resolution must be negotiated with the Undergraduate Internship Experiences Coordinator (Clinical Coordinator) . Permission must be obtained prior to making any travel or registration arrangements. Students must be in excellent clinica l and academic standing to be permitted to substitute professional gatherings for clinical time. Social Networks Professional conduct extends to all forms of social platforms and any other means of communication. Students must follow HIPAA guidelines when dealing with information about clients and patients. Students must also follow privacy laws when exposed to information about other students, faculty, staff, and other students met during their time at the College of Nursing. Permission prior to recording or taping must be obtained. Failure to follow these rules, may result in administrative action, including dismissal from the College of Nursing. Disrespectful behavior by students towards other students, faculty, staff, patients, clients, agencies, etc. w ill not be tolerated. Inclement Weather Occasionally, inclement weather occurs. Students need to monitor school closings on the TV and/or radio. If the University of Central Florida is closed, the College of Nursing will not hold classes or clinicals. Students should listen for the closings of their specific campus (i.e. Orlando, Cocoa or Daytona). "}
