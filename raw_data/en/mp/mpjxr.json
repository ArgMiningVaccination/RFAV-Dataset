The NCCAM identified fivedomains of CAM therapies: (e.g.,Chinese Mind-Body Interventions Manipulative and Body-Based Therapy(e.g., Sensory Integration Therapy) and EnergyTherapy (e.g., Magnet Therapy). FACTORS LEADING TO THE USE OF CAM Factors which influence parents to choose alternative therapies are often based upon thecomplexity of the developmental diagnosis. The moreunfavorable the prognosis of a child's disability, or theinability to guarantee success with standardtherapies, the more likely a parent is to seek acomplementary or alternative therapy. Parents mayopt for these therapies: if their child's medicalprovider is unfamiliar with the developmentalproblem, if adequate resources are unavailable, or ifteachers or therapists, who have establishedemotional ties with the families, makerecommendations for these therapies. Certain culturaland religious practice must also be taken into accountas a factor in the use of CAM (Eisenberg, 1993). The prevalence of reported use in the general pediatric population is only between 11-21% (Eisenberg et al,1998; Ottolini et al., 2001). However, in treatment ofchildren with cerebral palsy, 55% of parents reportedthe use of CAM to treat the child's tight muscles(spasticity), and 50% of children with autism receivesome form of CAM (Nickel, 1996). Alternative treatments have flourished for a variety of childhood disorders and have been especiallyprevalent in the treatment of autism and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These twodisorders are chronic and tend to be difficult to treat.The body of this article will focus on some of thealternative therapies in these conditions. TREATMENTS FOR AUTISM: Biologically-Based Therapies: (1) Elimination diets remove certain food products from the child's daily diet. These diets are basedupon presumed food allergies alleged to be thecause of the child's developmental problem. Forexample, elimination of casein (found in milk)and gluten (found in wheat) has been described.This is based on the theory that children withautism have leaky gut linings that allowabsorption of compounds, which can alterbehavior. (2) Vitamin B6 supplementation presumes to affect brain metabolism and is felt to affect attention. Itis often given with magnesium in the hopes ofimproving language function. (3) Dimethylglycine, also known as Panthothenic acid or vitamin B15, is a food supplement felt toimprove language skills based upon an olderreport from Russia. (4) Omega-3 fish oils or essential fatty acids are presumed to affect the transmission of nerveimpulses in children with short attention spans.Recent studies indicate that these oils may, infact, prove to be beneficial in these children. (5) Pepcid, a medication to reduce stomach acid production, has been used to prevent what ispresumed to be a more leaky or permeable gut inchildren with autism. EITINewsletter Early Intervention Training Institute Winter 2005 - 2006 Rose F. Kennedy Center University Center for Excellence2(6 Antifungal or yeast therapy, including diet and medication, is based on the theory that somedevelopmental disorders are caused by theovergrowth of yeast in the colon. (7) Intravenous immunoglobulin treatment for presumed immune weaknesses is based uponthe history of developmental regression in up toone third of children with autism, creating aconcern of possible immune factor deficiency inautism. (8) Secretin, a protein hormone derived from the pancreas, once believed to resolve symptoms ofautism, is based upon a small series of casehistories. However, when studied using scientificmethod, over 12 controlled studies failed toreveal treatment response. (9) Chelation therapy involves the removal of heavy metal toxins. This is based on a theory thatheavy metals such as mercury lead to autism-like symptoms. Sources of mercury could includecertain types of fish and thimerosal, apreservative, used in preparation of vaccines.Numerous studies both in the US and abroadhave failed to support this theory. Additionally,thimerosal has been eliminated from vaccinessince 1998 without any documented decrease inthe incidence of autism. (10) Withholding vaccinations is based upon the theory that exposing the immune system tomultiple antigens (proteins) such as thosefound in will overwhelm the child's immunesystem. Manipulative and Body-based Therapies Sensory Integration Therapy is a therapeutic approach developed by Ayres (1972), who suggestedthat inefficient neurological processing of informationreceived through our five senses causes problems withlearning, development and behavior. In particular, theareas most affected would be the vestibular (balance),proprioceptive (muscle stability) and tactile (touch)areas. hyposensitivity toincoming stimuli (difficulties with textures,foods, labels, sounds, etc.). Sensory integrationtherapy purports to improve adaptive function to one'senvironment by providing appropriate sensory inputthrough series of exercises and activities, as well asmanipulating the child's environment to preventover/under stimulation. Controlled studies, however,failed to show improved academic achievement orincreased motor development. Sensory integrationalso did not reduce ritualistic behaviors. It did providephysical activity in individualized settings, but there was lack of objective evidence to endorse it as a primary intervention. Despite the lack of evidence, itis a therapy that remains in high demand. TREATMENTS FOR ADHD Biologically-based Therapies: (1) The Feingold Diet is a diet based on a theory that salicylates found in food dyes and flavoringscontribute to the symptoms of ADHD. Althoughobjective studies have never confirmed thistheory, a small subgroup of children with ADHDmay respond somewhat positively to thisintervention. (2) Amino Acid and Megavitamin therapy have not been shown to have compelling results indiminishing the symptoms of hyperactivity,impulsivity or distractibility. (3) Herbal remedies such as ginkgo-leaf extracts (memory), valerian root (insomnia), chamomile(relaxation) and lemon balm (relaxation) arefrequently used in the form of tea and arepurported to decrease the symptoms of ADHD. (4) Iron therapy has been used in children with ADHD and low levels of iron. Parents whosechildren have been on iron therapy have reportedimproved behavior; however, reports from thechildren's schoolteachers did not reveal anyreduction in ADHD symptoms when the childrenwere supplemented with iron. (5) Homeopathic treatments using tiny amounts of Stramonium niger (for nervousness), Cina (forrestlessness) or Hyoscyamus (for poor impulsecontrol) are commonly used treatments withvariable response. Again, there are nodocumented objective studies of efficacy. (6) Dietary supplements which include essential fatty acids (evening primrose, flaxseed oils,omega-3) are felt to aid normal nervetransmission. Newer objective studies aresuggesting positive findings. These supplementsmay become approved in the near future. (7) Graphine, an antioxidant felt to improve memory and recall, has had some equivocal response, buthas not been studied well. (8) L-glutamine, an amino acid, is needed for normal concentration and is felt to be atsubnormal levels in children with ADHD. Mind Body Therapies in ADHD (1) EEG Neurofeedback or neurotherapy, has become a popular therapy purporting to reduceADHD symptoms by attempting to change thetype of neuroelectrical activity in the brain froma high frequency Beta EEG activity to a lowfrequency Theta EEG activity. Advocates insistthat this type of biofeedback training has an 85%3rate in reducing ADHD symptoms. However, the use of neurofeedback is very expensive and thereare no studies to indicate whether effects aresustained. (2) Martial Arts have become popular as a therapeutic intervention felt to have a moreprolonged effect on behavior. These interventionshave only anecdotal support, however. (3) Interactive Metronome is a popular treatment using biofeedback and requires hours of trainingat a great cost with only equivocal results. SUMMARY The use of complementary and alternative medicine is increasing, especially among children with chronicor developmental problems. To best serve the needs ofthese children and their families, a clinician should befamiliar with the various CAM approaches andevaluate claims of effectiveness. It is crucial to identifypotential harmful effects (e.g. peripheral neuropathywith vitamin B6 toxicity, liver toxicity with vitamin A,heavy metal toxicity with certain Santeria (or othercultural practices), and to provide information tofamilies about all treatment approaches. Families and clinicians feel the pressure to do something for the child. However, the family needs tounderstand that more intervention is not necessarilybetter and that many unconventional therapies arenot proven to be efficacious and may actually interferewith or delay the child receiving the therapyconsidered to be the standard of care. It would behelpful to explain the placebo effect and the need for controlled studies before pursuing controversialtherapies. Parents may be unaware that the observedresults of a therapy may be due to their highexpectations of that therapy. For example, parentsstrongly believing that a certain medication is effectivein relieving a troubling symptom, might actually startto feel that they are observing this result even thoughthe medication might contain nothing other thansugar (a placebo). It would also be of benefit to explain that controlled and blinded studies look objectively at groups ofaffected and unaffected patients (control subjects), todetermine the efficacy of that therapy. Researchersdoing the study are \"blinded\" (do not know whetherparticipants belong to affected or control groups).This gives researchers more objectivity in measuringthe observed response to the therapy. In addition,these studies are then put through rigorous review bypeers in order that the findings be published inreputable journals. Nonetheless, if parents opt for an alternative therapy not been deemed to be harmful, it is best thatthe clinician remain neutral and offer support interms of follow-up. This will strengthen the rapportbetween the parents and clinician and allow the parents to determine the efficacy of the treatment on their own.
