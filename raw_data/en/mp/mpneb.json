If you or a loved one is feeling tired during or after in-center treatment and wondering how to get energy after dialysis, consider exploring the many benefits of [home dialysis](/treatment/benefits-of-home-dialysis). How Home Dialysis Works There are two types of home dialysis: [home peritoneal dialysis (PD)](/treatment/peritoneal-dialysis)and [home hemodialysis (home HD)](/treatment/home-hemodialysis). the lining of your abdominal wall\u2014your peritoneum\u2014to filter toxins and excess fluid from your blood. Home HD works the same as in-center dialysis, using an artificial kidney to filter your blood outside of your body before returning clean, chemically balanced blood to you. There are specific considerations for both forms of home dialysis, so talk to your doctor and care team to see which one might be right for you. 4 Ways Home Dialysis Boosts Energy Levels Home dialysis puts you in control of your treatment and may help you feel better, have more energy, and live longer. Here are some of the benefits you may experience from home dialysis. 1. Ability to dialyze more often Home dialysis schedules will vary based on your specific needs, but many people who dialyze at home are prescribed more frequent treatments than they would be if they went to a dialysis center. There are many options for home dialysis to fit any lifestyle, including 30-minute sessions a couple of times a day, longer daily sessions, or dialyzing at night [while sleeping](/thrive-central/dialysis-home-while-sleeping). More frequent dialysis means your blood is filtered more often, and some patients find this leads to more energy overall. 2. Reduced recovery time For in-center dialysis, the standard recovery time from treatment is eight hours.1 More frequent home dialysis treatments may improve your recovery time. Additionally, shorter recovery times may also lead to higher energy levels. 3. Flexible dialysis scheduling Home dialysis takes place in the comfort of your own home, on a schedule that makes sense for your lifestyle. The frequency and duration of your treatment will depend on your individual needs. Finding the schedule that works for you can make it easier to fit dialysis into your busy life and make sure you have the time you need to relax and recover. 4. Improved quality of sleep Sleep can be hard for people on dialysis. People on home HD have a 26 percent reduction in restless leg syndrome, and an overall 15 to 17 percent reduction in sleep problems.2 Improving the quality of your sleep can help you feel more rested and ready to take on your day.
