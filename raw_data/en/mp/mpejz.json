The only thing that changes when I use different blends is the exact combination and ratio of oils that I use. - 1 oz [witch hazel](https://amzn.to/3rNrU6K)(make sure you get one that does contain alcohol because it helps preserve the spray) - 20 drops essential oils (see my specific recipes belo - 1 oz distilled water (or well water) - 2 oz [Glass spray bottle](https://amzn.to/3Dr89nJ) NOTE: A good general rule of thumb is to use about 10 drops of essential oil for every 1 oz in your spray bottle. So if you have a 2oz spray bottle, you would use 20 drops. A 4 oz bottle would require 40 drops, etc. Directions - Fill your spray bottle about half full with [witch hazel](https://amzn.to/3rNrU6K). Add the drops of essential oils. Then fill the rest of the bottle with water. - Screw the lid or spray piece onto the bottle and shake well. - Shake well before each use to help re-mix the essential oils.
