We show that thetechnological breakthrough of the Sixth Kondratieff Wave may be interpreted asboth the Fourth Industrial Revolution and as the nal phase of the Cybernetic Revolution. We assume that the sixth K-wave in the 2030s and 2040s will merge with the nal phase of the Cybernetic Revolution (which we call a phase of self-regulating systems). This period will be characterized by the breakthrough inmedical technologies which will be capable of combining a number of othertechnologies into a single system of new and innovative technologies (we denotethis system as a system of MANBRIC-technologies\u2014i.e. medical, additive, nano-,bio-, IT Cognitive technologies 1 Introduction: Cybernetic Revolution, Scientic- Cybernetic Production Principle, the Sixth KondratieffWave, and the Fourth Industrial Revolution The production revolution which began in the 1950s and is still proceeding, has led to a powerful acceleration of scientic and technological progress.

(eds.), Industry 4.0 , Studies on Entrepreneurship, Structural Change and Industrial Dynamics, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-49604-7_13243'Cybernetic '(see our explanation below). The initial phase of this revolution (the 1950s\u2014the 1990s) can be referred to as a scientic-information because it wascharacterized by the transition to scientic methods of planning, forecasting, marketing, logistics, production managements, distribution and circulation of resources, and communication. The most radical changes took place in the sphereof informatics and information technologies. The nal phase will begin approxi-mately in the 2030s or the 2040s and will last until the 2070s (note that manycontributors to this volume denote this forthcoming technological breakthrough asthe \"Fourth Industrial Revolution\"). We believe that it can be also interpreted as aphase of self-regulating systems of the Cybernetic Revolution (see below). We donot think that these interpretations are mutually exclusive; on the contrary, they are perfectly compatible. Now we are in the intermediate (modernization) phase of the Cybernetic Revolution which will last until the 2030s. It is characterized bypowerful improvements and the diffusion of innovations made at the initialphase\u2014in particular by a wide proliferation of easy-to-handle computers, meansof communication, and the formation of a macro-sector of services among whichinformation and nancial services take center stage. At the same time the inno-vations necessary to start the nal phase of the Cybernetic Revolution are beingprepared. Cybernetic Revolution is a great breakthrough from industrial production to production and services based on the operation of self-regulating systems. Table 1demonstrates the connection between three phases of the scientic- cybernetic production principle (which coincide with three phases of the CyberneticRevolution) and three Kondratieff waves 1(the fourth, fth and sixth). 1.1 Peculiarities of the Fourth Kondratieff Wave in Connection with the Beginning of the CyberneticRevolution The fourth K-wave (the second half of the 1940s\u20141980s) fell on the initial phase of the Cybernetic Revolution. The beginning of a new production revolution is aspecial period which is connected with the fast transition to a more advancedtechnological component of economy. All accumulated innovations and a largenumber of new innovations generate a new system that has a real synergetic effect.It would appear reasonable that an upward phase of the K-wave coinciding with thebeginning of a production revolution can appear more powerful than A-phases of other K-waves. 1See Kondratieff 1926 ,1935 ,1984 ,1998 ,2004 [1922] ; Schumpeter 1939 ; Hirooka 2006 ; Devezas 2006 ,2010 ,2012 ; Korotayev et al. 2011 ; Grinin et al. 2012 ,2014 ,2016c ; Korotayev and Grinin 2012 ; Grinin and Grinin 2015 ,2016 for more detail on Kondratieff waves.244 L. Grinin et al.That was the feature of the upswing A-phase of the fourth K-wave (1947-1974) which coincided with the scientic-information phase of the Cybernetic Revolu-tion. As a result, a denser than usual cluster of innovations (in comparison with thesecond, third and fth waves) was formed during that period. All this also explains why in the 1950s and 1960s the economic growth rates of the World System were higher, than in the A-phases of the third and fth K-waves. The downswing phase ofthe fourth K-wave (the 1970s-1980s) in its turn also fell on the last period of theinitial phase of the Cybernetic Revolution. This explains in many respects why thisdownswing phase was shorter than those of the other K-waves. 1.2 The Fifth K-Wave and the Delay of the New Wave of Innovations It was expected that the 1990s and the 2000s would bring a radically new wave of innovations, comparable in their revolutionary character with computer techno- logies, and therefore capable of creating a new technological paradigm. Those directions which had already appeared and those which are supposed to becomeTable 1.

However, it was the development and diversication of already existing digitalelectronic technologies and rapid development of nancial technologies that became the basis for the fth K-wave. Those innovations which were really created during the fth K-wave as, for example, energy technologies, still have a smallshare in the general energy, and, above all, they have not developed properly. Someresearchers believe that from 1970s up to the present is the time for the deceleratingscientic and technological progress (see a discussion on this topic in Brener 2006 ; Khaltourina and Korotayev 2007 ; see also Maddison 2007 ). Polterovich ( 2009 ) also offers the notion of a technological pause. But, in general, the mentioned techno-logical delay is, in our opinion, insufciently explained. We believe that taking features of the intermediate modernization phase of a production revolution (i.e., the second phase of the production principle) into account can help explain this.Functionally it is less innovative; rather during this phase earlier innovationsbecome more widely spread and are improved. As regards the 1990s-2020s (the intermediate phase of the Cybernetic Revolu- tion) the question is that the launch of a new innovative breakthrough demands thatthe developing countries reach the level of the developed ones, and the politicalcomponent of the world catches up with the economic one (see Grinin and Korotayev 2010 ,2014a ,b; Korotayev and de ,2014 2014 ; Korotayev et al. 2011a ,b,c,2012 ,2015 ). Thus, the delayed introduction of innovations of the new generation is explained, rst, by the fact that the center cannot endlessly surpass the periphery in develop-ment, that is the gap between developed and developing countries cannot increaseall the time. Secondly, the economy cannot constantly surpass the political andother components, as this causes very strong disproportions and deformations. Andthe appearance of new general-purpose technologies, certainly, would accelerate economic development and increase disparities. Thirdly, introduction and distri- bution of the new basic technologies do not occur automatically, but only within anappropriate socio-political environment (see Grinin and Grinin 2016 ; Korotayev 2014a ,b; see also Perez 2002 ). In order for basic innovations to be suitable for business, structural changes in political and social spheres are neces-sary, eventually promoting their synergy and wide implementation in the world ofbusiness. Thus, the delay is caused by difculties of changing political and social insti- tutions on the regional and even global scale, and also (or, perhaps, rst of all) within the international economic institutions. The latter can change only as a result of thestrong political will of the main players, which is difcult to execute in theframework of the modern political institutions. These institutions rather can changeunder the conditions of depressive development (and probable aggravation of theforeign relations) compelling them to reorganize and dismantle conventional insti-tutions that are unlikely to be changed under ordinary conditions due to a lack ofcourage and opportunities (for our vision of the future of the world order see Grinin and Korotayev 2010 ,2015a ; Grinin et al. 2016a ).246 L. Grinin et al.The above explains as well the reasons of different rates of development as regards the center and periphery of the World System during the fth K-wave (formore detail see Grinin and Korotayev 2010 ,2015a ; Grinin et al. 2016a ). The periphery was expected to catch up with the center due to the faster rates of its development and slowdown of the center development. However, one should notexpect continuous crisis-free development of the periphery\u2014a crisis will come laterand probably in other forms. Without a slow-down of the development of theperiphery and serious changes, full harmonization of the economic and politicalcomponent will not happen. Consequently, it might be supposed that in the nextdecade (approximately by 2020-2025) the growth rates of the peripheral economiescan also slow down, and internal problems will aggravate; this can stimulate structural changes in the peripheral countries, thus also increasing international tension. The world order has already begun to change, and it will continue to change over the next 10-20 years and some visible results of this change may appear by the startof the new K-wave. We have called this change \"the Grinin et al. 2016a ,b). Thus, we suppose that in the next 10-15 years the world will face serious and painful changes. The World System reconguration processes further explain the reasons for the very turbulent processes observed in the recent years. 2 Characteristics of the Cybernetic Revolution 2.1 What Are Self-regulating Systems and Why Are They So Important? Self-regulating systems are systems that can regulate themselves, responding in a pre-programmed and intelligent way to the feed-back from the environment. Theseare the systems that operate either with a small input from human or completelywithout human intervention. Today there are many self-regulating systems, forexample, pilotless electric cars, articial Earth satellites, drones, navigation sys- tems laying the route for a driver. Another good example is life-support systems (such as medical ventilation apparatuses or articial hearts). They can control anumber of parameters, choose the most suitable mode of operation and detectcritical situations. There are also special programs that determine the value ofstocks and other securities, react to price changes, buy and sell them, carry outthousands of operations in a day and x a prot. A great number of self-regulatingsystems have been created but they are mostly technical and information systems(like robots or computer programs). During the nal phase of the Cybernetic Revolution there will be a lot of self-regulating systems connected with biology and bionics, physiology and medicine, agriculture and environment. The number ofsuch systems as well as their complexity and their autonomy will dramaticallyThe MANBRIC-Technologies in the Forthcoming Technological Revolution 247increase. These systems will also signicantly reduce energy and resource con- sumption. Human life will become organized to a greater extent by such self-regulating systems (for example, by monitoring health, daily regimens, regulating or recommending levels of personal exertion, having control over the patients' condition, prevention of illegal actions, etc. [for more detail about self-regulatingsystems see Grinin and Grinin 2016 ]). Thus, we designate the modern revolution 'Cybernetic, 'because its main sense is the wide creation and distribution of self-regulating autonomous systems. Cyber-netics, as is well-known, is a science of regulatory systems. Its main principles arequite suitable for the description of self-regulating systems (see, e.g., Wiener 1948 ; Ashby 1956 ; Foerster and Zopf 1962 ; Beer 1967 ,1994 ; Umpleby and Dent 1999 ). As a result, the opportunity to control various natural, social and production processes without direct human intervention (that is impossible or extremelylimited now) will increase. In the fourth phase (of maturity and expansion) of thescientic cybernetic production principle (the 2070s and 2080s) the achievementsof the Cybernetic Revolution will become quite systemic and wide-scale in its nalphase (for more detail see Grinin 2006 ; Grinin and Grinin 2016 ). Below we enumerate the most important characteristics and trends of the Cybernetic Revolution and its technologies. These features are closely interconnected and support each other. 2.2 The Most Important Characteristics and Trends of the Cybernetic Revolution 1. Increases in the amount of information and complexity in the analysis of the systems (including the ability of systems for independent communication andinteraction). 2. Sustainable development of the system of regulation and self-regulation.3. Mass use of articial materials which previously lacked the appropriate archi- tectural properties. 4. Qualitatively increasing controllability a) of systems and processes that vary in their constitution (including living material); and b) of new levels of managingthe organization of matter (up to sub-atomic levels, as well as the use of tinyparticles as building blocks). 5. Miniaturization as a trend of the constantly decreasing size of particles, mech- anisms, electronic devices, implants, etc. 6. Resource and energy saving in every sphere.7. Individualization as one of the most important technological trends. 8. Implementation of smart technologies and a trend toward humanization of their functions (use of a common language, voice, etc.).248 L. Grinin et al.2.3 The Most Important Characteristics and Trends of the Cybernetic Revolution 1. The transformation and analysis of information as an essential part of technologies. 2. The increasing connection between the technological systems and environment.3. A trend toward automation of control is observed together with the increasing level of controllability and self-regulation of systems. 4. The capabilities of materials and technologies to adjust to different objectives and tasks (smart materials and technologies) as well as capabilities for choosing optimum regimes in the context of certain goals and tasks . 5. A large-scale synthesis of the materials and characteristics of the systems of different nature (e.g., of animate and inanimate nature). 6. The integration of machinery, equipment and hardware with technology (know- how and knowledge of the process) into a unied technical and technologicalsystem. 2 7. Self-regulating systems (see below) will become the major component of tech- nological processes. That is the reason why the nal (forthcoming) phase of the Cybernetic Revolution is (or should) be called the epoch of self-regulating systems (see below). 2.4 Medicine as a Sphere of the Initial Technological Breakthrough and the Emergence of MANBRIC-Technology Complex It is worth remembering that the (rst) Industrial Revolution began in a rather narrow area of cotton textile manufacturing and was connected with the solution ofquite concrete problems\u2014at rst, liquidation of the gap between spinning andweaving, and then, after increasing weavers 'productivity, searching for ways to mechanize spinning. However, the solution of these narrow tasks caused an explo-sion of innovations conditioned by the existence of a large number of the major elements of machine production (including abundant mechanisms, primitive steam- engines, quite a high volume of coal production, etc.) which gave an impulse to thedevelopment of the Industrial Revolution. In a similar way, we assume that theCybernetic Revolution will start rst in a certain area. Given the general vector of scientic achievements and technological develop- ment and taking into account that a future breakthrough area should be highly 2During the Industrial Epoch these elements existed separately: technologies were preserved on paper or in the engineer 's minds. At present, thanks to IT and other technologies the technological constituent fulls the managing function facilitating the path to the epoch of self-regulatingsystems.The MANBRIC-Technologies in the Forthcoming Technological Revolution 249commercially attractive and have a wide market, we forecast that the nal phase of this revolution will begin somewhere at the intersection of medicine and a numberof other technologies (we will provide reasons for this statement below). By the 2030s there can appear unique opportunities for a breakthrough in medicine (see below). However, when speaking about medicine, one should keep in mind thatwith respect to potential revolutionary transformations medicine is a very hetero-geneous sphere. That is why the breakthrough will not occur in all spheres ofmedicine but in its one or two innovative elds. Perhaps, it has already formed(as biomedicine or nanomedicine) or it can form as a result of the introduction ofsome other innovative technologies into medicine. As for other branches of med-icine, revolutionary transformations will begin there later. Moreover, some branches of medicine would be unable to transform due to their conservatism. Thus, more radical reforms will occur in these elds in the future. In general, the breakthrough vector in medicine and associated branches can be dened as a rapid growth of opportunities for correction or even modication of thehuman biological nature. In other words, it will be possible to extend our opportu-nities to alter a human body, perhaps, to some extent, its genome; to widen sharplyour opportunities of minimally invasive influence and operations instead of themodern surgical ones; to use extensively means of cultivating separate biological materials, bodies or their parts and elements for regeneration and rehabilitation of an organism, and also articial analogues of biological material (bodies,receptors), etc. This will make it possible to radically expand the opportunities to dramatically increase life expectancy and improve physiological abilities of people as well ashealth-related quality of life (HRQoL). It will be technologies intended for commonuse in the form of a mass market service. Certainly, it will take a rather long period(about two or three decades) from the rst steps in that direction (in the 2030s and 2040s) to their common use (about some possible forthcoming medical techno- logies see Appendix). On the whole, the drivers of the nal phase of the Cybernetic Revolution will be medical technologies, additive manufacturing (3D printers), nano- andbio-technologies, robotics, IT, cognitive sciences, which will together form asophisticated system of self-regulating production. We can andcognitive technologies). As is known, with respect to the sixth technological paradigm (known also as the sixth technological system or style) there is a widely used idea connected with the notion of NBIC-technologies (or NBIC-convergence)(see Lynch 2004 ; Bainbridge and Roco 2005 ; Dator 2006 ;rotayev 2008; Akaev 2012 ). There are also some researchers (e.g., Jotterand 2008 ) who see in this role another set of technological directions\u2014GRAIN (Genomics, Robotics, ArticialIntelligence, Nanotechnology). However, we believe that this set will be larger.And medical technologies will be its integrating part. It should be noted that Leo Neodow has been writing about health as the leading technology of the sixth Kondratieff wave for a long time (Neodow 1996 ; Neodow and Neodow 2014a ,b). He explains that health is much more250 L. Grinin et al.than medicine and includes mental, psychosocial, environmental and spiritual aspects. He believes that medicine covers only a small part of the health problemswe face today. We agree that health is more than medicine. However, we regard medicine as the most important business sphere connected with health care (note that the overwhelming majority of researchers in the health area work with medicaltechnologies). We also agree with Neodow that business and prot far fromalways serve people. But we do not know any power beside medical businesswhich has opportunities (in co-operation with such state agencies as the NationalInstitutes of Health in the USA) to nance research and development in this area, toelaborate new ways to ght mortal diseases, to invest in prolongation of lifeexpectancy. In Neodow 's opinion, health area covers not only psychotherapeutic, psychological and psychiatric services, but also numerous measures of health improvement that, using his terms, will reduce social entropy. The problems withthis argument, based on reducing social entropy (e.g., corruption, small and largecrime, drug addiction, lack of moral guide, divorces, violence, etc.), is that socialentropy (as Neodow himself points out) has always existed in society. Socialchanges can be really extremely important for the creation of starting conditions fora long-term upswing in reducing social entropy (see Grinin and Grinin 2013 ,2015 for more detail). However, it is production and/or commercial technologies that represent the driving force of the K-Wave upswing phases. There is one more important point. The Neodows believe that it is biotechnologies that will becomean integrating core of the new technological paradigm. However, we suppose thatthe leading role of biotechnologies will be, rst of all, in their possibilities to solvemajor medical problems. That is why it makes sense to speak about medicaltechnologies as the core of a new technological paradigm. Besides, we forecast amore important role of nanotechnologies than the the Neodows do (Neodow andNeodow 2014b : Chap. 3). Nanotechnologies will be of great importance in terms of the development of bio- and medical technologies (they are supposed to play a crucial role in the ght against cancer; at the same time nanotechnologies will playa crucial role in other spheres too, in particular in energy and resource saving). Thus, we maintain the following: 1. Medicine will be the rst sphere to start the nal phase of the Cybernetic Revolution, but, later on, self-regulating systems development will cover themost diverse areas of production, services and life. 2. We treat medicine in a broad sense, because it will include (and already actively includes) for its purposes a great number of other scientic branches: e.g., theuse of robots in surgery and care of patients, information technologies in remotemedical treatment, neural interfaces for treatment of mental illness and brainresearch; gene therapy and engineering, nanotechnologies for creation of arti- cial immunity and biochips which monitor organisms; new materials for grow- ing articial organs and many other things to become a powerful sector ofeconomy. 3. The medical sphere has unique opportunities to combine the above mentioned technologies into a single system.The MANBRIC-Technologies in the Forthcoming Technological Revolution 2514. There are also some demographic and economic reasons why the phase of self- regulating systems will start in medicine: - Increase in average life expectancy and population ageing will favor not only the growth of medical opportunities to maintain health, but also allow the extensionof working age, as population ageing will be accompanied by shortages in theworking-age population. - People, in general, are always ready to spend money on health and beauty. However, the growth of the world middle class and the cultural standard of people implies much greater willingness and solvency in this terms. - Medical corporations usually do not impede technological progress, but, on the contrary, are interested in it. Thus, today medicine is a very important sector of the economy, and tomorrow it will become even more powerful. 3 Global Demographic Factors A number of global demographic factors explain why in particular in medicine thetransition to the new technological paradigm should start. This will be supported by a particularly advantageous situation developing by 2030 in economy, demography, culture, a standard of living, etc.\u2014these will dene a huge need for scientic and technological breakthrough. By advantageous situ- ation we do not mean that everything will be perfectly good in the economy; just onthe contrary, everything will be not as good as it could be. Advantageous conditionswill be created because reserves and resources for prolonging previous trends willbe exhausted, and at the same time the requirements of currently developed anddeveloping societies will increase. Consequently, one will search for new develop-mental patterns. Particular attention should be paid to the global population aging (see Figs. 1,2, 3, and 4). As shown above, an especially rapid global increase in the number of age persons above retirement-age is expected to come in the next 20 years\u2014theirnumber will actually double during a short historical period, thus it will increaseby almost 600 million and the total number will considerably exceed a billion. However, a massive acceleration will be observed in particular of people aged 80 years or more. While by 2050 the number of persons of retirement age willapproximately double, the number of elderly people aged 80 years or more willpractically quadruple and, in comparison with 1950, their number by 2075 will increase almost by 50 times (see Fig. 4). As we can see, over the next 35 years there will be a truly explosive growth of population over 80 years old. By the 2050s, the global population of this age groupquadruple. A particularly rapid growth will occur in the 2030s and 2040s, when thenumber of very old (and hence having particular acute needs in medical care)people will grow from 200 to 400 million (by 200 million people) just within252 L.

And this is the very period when we expect a technological breakthrough in medicine. As we can see, the UN forecast shows that the demographic conditionsfor such a breakthrough in those years will be extremely favorable. An explosivegrowth of the number of very old people will mean an equally explosive increase indemand for medical services that will serve as a powerful incentive to increase even more research and development in this area. On the other hand, it would mean a very rapid growth of the market for such services\u2014which implies that new devel-opments in this area will have brilliant opportunities for commercialization that willstimulate further growth in life expectancy, forming a positive feedback loop thatcan act as a powerful driving force of this technological breakthrough. So by the 2030s, the number of middle-aged and elderly people will increase; economy will desperately need additional labor resources while the state will beinterested in increasing the working ability of elderly people, whereas the popula- tion of wealthy and educated people will grow in a rather signicant way. In other words, the unique conditions for the stimulation of business, science and the state tomake a breakthrough in the eld of medicine will emerge, and just these uniqueconditions are necessary to start the innovative phase of production revolution! It is extremely important to note that enormous nancial resources will be accumulated for the technological breakthrough, such as: the pension moneywhose volume will increase at high rates; spending of governments on medicaland social needs; growing expenses of the ageing population on health (related) services, and also on health services obtained by the growing world middle class. All this can provide initial large investments, an appeal of high investment ofrespective venture projects and long-term high demand for innovative products,thus a full set of favorable conditions for a powerful technological breakthroughwill become available.0100200300400500600700 1950 1970 1990 2010 2030 2050 2070MillionsFig. 4.

Grinin et al.4 Self-regulating Systems Phase and the Sixth Kondratieff Wave 4.1 The 6th K-Wave A-Phase: Take-off Run Before the Start of the Final Phase of the Cybernetic Revolution The sixth K-wave will probably begin approximately in the 2020s. Meanwhile the nal phase of the Cybernetic Revolution has to begin later, at least, in the 2030s or2040s. Thus, we suppose, that a new technological paradigm will not develop in anecessary form even by the 2020s (thus, the innovative pause will take longer thanexpected\u2014see Grinin et al. 2016c : Chap. 6). However, it should be kept in mind that the beginning of the Kondratieff wave upswing phase is never directly causedby new technologies. This beginning is synchronized with the start of the medium-term business cycle 's upswing. And the upswing takes place as a result of the levelling of proportions in economy, the accumulation of resources and other impulses that improve demand and conjuncture. One should remember, that thebeginning of the second Kondratieff wave was connected with the discovery of golddeposits in California and Australia, the third wave was linked with an increase inprices for wheat, the fourth one with the post-war reconstruction, the fth one withthe economic reforms in the UK and the USA, as well as oil price shocks. And then,given an upswing, a new technological paradigm (which could not completely\u2014ifat all\u2014realize its potential) facilitates overcoming of cyclic crises and allows further growth. Consequently, some conjunctural events will also stimulate an upward impulse of the sixth K-wave. And, for example, the rapid growth of the underdevelopedworld regions (such as Tropical Africa, the Islamic East, and some Latin Americancountries) or new nancial and organizational technologies can become a primaryimpulse. Naturally, there will also appear some technical and technological inno-vations which, however, will not form a new paradigm yet. Besides, we supposethat nancial technologies have not nished yet its expansion in the world. If we can modify and secure them somehow, they will be able to spread into various regions which underuse them now. One should not forget that large-scale applica-tion of such technologies demands essential changes in legal and other systems,which is absolutely necessary for developmental levelling in the world. Taking intoaccount a delay of the new generation of technologies, the period of the 2020s mayresemble the 1980s. In other words, it will be neither a recession, nor a realupswing, but rather somehow accelerated development (with stronger developmentin some regions and continuous depression in others\u2014see Grinin et al. 2016c : Chap. 3). Then, given the favorable conditions as they had been mentioned above, during this wave the nal phase of the Cybernetic Revolution will begin. In such a situationit is possible to assume that the sixth K-wave 's A-phase (the 2020s-2050s) will have much stronger manifestation and last longer than that of the fth one due tomore dense combination of technological generations. And since the CyberneticThe MANBRIC-Technologies in the Forthcoming Technological Revolution 255Revolution will evolve, the sixth K-wave 's downward B-phase (the 2050s-the 2060/70s), is expected to be not so depressive, as those during the third or fthwaves. In general, during this K-wave (the 2020s-the 2060/70s) the Scientic and Information Revolution will come to an end, and the scientic and cybernetic production principle will acquire its mature shape. 4.2 There Is Another Scenario The nal phase of the Cybernetic Revolution can begin later\u2014not in the 2030s, butin the 2040s. In this case the A-phase of the sixth wave will terminate before thebeginning of the regulating systems revolution; therefore, it will not be based onfundamentally new technologies and will not become so powerful as is supposed inthe previous scenario. The nal phase of the Cybernetic Revolution in this case will coincide with the B-phase of the sixth wave (as it was the case with the zero wave during the First Industrial Revolution, 1760-1787\u2014see Grinin et al. 2016c : Chaps. 2 and 6) and at the A-phase of the seventh wave. In this case the emergenceof the seventh wave is highly possible. The B-phase of the sixth wave should berather short due to the emergence of a new generation of technologies, and theA-phase of the seventh wave could be rather long and powerful. 4.3 The End of the Cybernetic Revolution and Possible Disappearance of K-Waves The sixth K-wave (about 2020-the 2060/70s), like the rst K-wave, will proceed generally during completion of the production revolution (see Grinin et al. 2016c : Chap. 6). However, there is an important difference. During the rst K-wave theduration of the one phase of the industrial production principle signicantlyexceeded the duration of the whole K-wave. But now one phase of the K-wavewill exceed the duration of one phase of production principle. This alone shouldessentially modify the course of the sixth K-wave; the seventh wave will be feeblyexpressed or will not occur at all (on the possibility of the other scenario see above).Such a forecast is based also on the fact that the end of the Cybernetic Revolution and diffusion of its results will promote integration of the World System and a considerable growth of influence of new universal regulation mechanisms. It isquite reasonable, taking into account the fact that the forthcoming nal phase of therevolution will be the revolution in the regulation of systems. Thus, the manage-ment of the economy should reach a new level. K-waves appeared at a certain phaseof global evolution and they are likely to disappear at its certain phase.256 L. Grinin et al.5 Conclusion: Some Possible Future Medical Technologies 5.1 Constant Health Monitoring as a Self-regulating Supersystem Nowadays the boundary between medical diagnosis and treatment already becomes more and more imperceptible. Diagnostics is a constant necessary measure fordisease controlling and drug dosage. During the nal phase of the CyberneticRevolution we expect breakthroughs in many elds of medical care. Thus, a veryimportant direction of self-regulation can be associated with the development of thehealth monitoring system that will allow an early diagnosis and prevention ofdiseases. The key compounds of such devices are biosensors. Biosensors are a good example of self-regulating systems and development of individualization (e.g., Cavalcanti et al. 2008 ). One can easily imagine that in the future biosensors will be able to become an integral part of human life fullling thefunction of a constant scanner of the organism or its certain organs and eventransmitting the information about it to medical centers in case of potential threatsor serious deterioration in the state of health. Built-in sensors will allow forcontrolling and regulating all vital processes, as well as prompting the time ofdrug intake and their dosage, time of physical activities and required exercises taking into account different circumstances, and recommending the most appropri- ate diet, etc. Respectively, such mini-systems can be integrated into a large system which monitors a large number of people, for example in medical centers, therapeuticfacilities, hotels, etc. We can forecast the decreasing number of hospitals, and suchmonitoring and remote online access can signicantly relieve hospitals. One canimagine that such systems will be able to detect potentially dangerous situationsand quickly respond to critical situations. That is a good example of prognostics and prevention of problems. We suppose that it will take much time to create such systems. Besides, there are complicated ethical and legal problems as regards tosuch monitoring as there always exists the danger that a watching 'Big Brother 'will take advantage of this. 5.2 Articial Antibodies and Growing Opportunities to Use the Immune System There will never be any universal drug against all diseases. But strengthening the immune system is one of the universal directions which can transform this situationand help the struggle against different diseases. There is a special instrument of thehuman immune system\u2014antibodies. Antibodies are the molecules synthesized to ght against certain cells of foreign origin\u2014antigens. The damage done by antigen usually leads to the destruction ofThe MANBRIC-Technologies in the Forthcoming Technological Revolution 257foreign organisms and to recovery. Specic antibodies are produced for each antigen. They are produced by special immune cells\u2014lymphocytes, which accu-mulate and circulate in the blood over the period of a lifetime. Thus, everyone has his own protective system based on the 'history of diseases '. It is one of the most important directions of development of individualization. Medicine is alwaysconnected with a patient's individuality. However, in the twentieth century therewas a tendency towards mass medicine (connected with mass vaccination, preven-tive examinations, etc.). At present there are some signs of transition from massmedicine to personal/individual medicine, which is related to the general tendencyof the Cybernetic Revolution towards individualization. But individualization to aneven greater extent will be manifested when based on the unique characteristics of the organism, one of which is the immune system. Articial antibodies can strengthen the tendency towards the individualization of medicine. Scientists have repeatedly attempted to produce articial antibodies. In 1970, Cesar Milstein and Georges K \u20acohler found the method of producing the antibodies of a certain type, that is of monoclonal antibodies. Nowadays a focus of muchmedical research is into the production of antibodies by other means (Schirhaglet al. 2012 ) and also the creation of chemoreceptors (Dickert et al. 2001 ). Anti- bodies have already become widely used in pregnancy tests, in the diagnostics of many diseases, in laboratory experiments. We suppose that during the nal phase of the Cybernetic Revolution there will be a considerable progress in the creation of articial antibodies and their accep-tance by the organism. There is no doubt that progress in this eld will lead to abreakthrough in medicine. The formation of articial antibodies will play animportant role in the prevention and treatment of many serious diseases, they willprevent the rejection of transplanted organs, etc. This will help make controlling thecourse of a disease easier and will help in suppressing the disease and defeating the disease if it is possible. Progress toward the creation of articial antibodies will mean a signicant growth of opportunities to control processes previously inacces-sible for controllable interference and formation of self-regulating systems forregulation of such interference. Control of programmed cell death ( apoptosis ) is one of the promising methods to defeat serious diseases including cancer. The researches into this eld have beencarried out since the 1960s. They show that some cells often die in strict compliancewith the predetermined plan. Thus, the microscopic worm nematode's embryo consists of 1090 cells before hatching but later some of them die and there remain only 959 cells in the adult worm organism (Raff 1998 ; Ridley 1996 ). The mecha- nism of apoptosis is associated with the activity of signaling molecules and specialreceptors which receive the signal, launch the processes of morphological andbiochemical changes, and as a result lead to the cell death. An opportunity to trigger the self-destruction of pathogenic cells can make the struggle against diseases controllable. Besides, it would secure a rapid recoverywithout a long period of rehabilitation which is necessary after surgical interven- tion, chemotherapy or radiation treatment (it is an example of economy of energy and time for a patient). We suppose that during the nal phase of the Cybernetic258 L. Grinin et al.Revolution medicine will be able to make progress in this direction and in the mature stages of the scientic-cybernetic principle of production to control it. Inthis case the movement toward creation of self-regulating systems will occur on the basis of the influence on the key elements of these subsystems of the organism in order to select the optimum regime in the context of certain goals and tasks. So insome cases it will be possible to cause the death of unwanted cells deliberately andin other cases to block the mechanism of death of necessary cells. Also switching off the mechanism of cell self-destruction will help to save an organism from some diseases and, probably, to control the process of ageing. But itis only one of the possible ways to slow down the ageing process. On the processesdetermining ageing and opportunities to 'ght 'ageing also see the monograph by Aubrey de Grey and Michael Rae ( 2007 ).
