For weeks now, I keep hearing the Lord say \"Pioneers, do not settle for Ishmael!\" Many are feeling the pressure right now in the spirit, like there's something that is meant to be birthed but nothing is in sight in the natural. It's become such a paradox and deep frustration or even grief because living with that kind of pent-up expectation is tiresome. It's like treading water knowing land is coming but it hasn't yet come and that's how many have been feeling - like the breakthrough that needs to come is not coming quick enough. Many pioneers are beginning to feel restless, hopeless, and despondent. It's been so long contending and warring and it's taken a toll to stay in that continual place of believing when it feels like nothing is shifting. But I feel this warning right now - do not settle for Ishmael! Ishmael was the firstborn son of Abraham, conceived out of his own desire to see the promise come to pass in his timing instead of God's. Right now we know we're in a season of time where fulfillment must come and we SEE what we have been contending for, but the enemy is on overdrive playing mind games and trying to lure us into entertaining ways of orchestrating the promise in our own strength and in our own timeline. This temptation has never been greater than right now. It's the feeling of impulsively acting upon your will and your expectations above waiting for the Lord. The lie so many pioneers have been hearing is, \"Is God even concerned about what I'm facing? Will he even perform it? Will he even do it?\" Let me say this very clearly to you right now - do not act upon this temptation to make things happen. We are in a window of time when God is opposing the enemy's plans and roadblocks and shifting major pieces in our lives. It's a time of doors of major closing and God preparing new infrastructure for the days ahead. It's an hour of the FINALIZATION of the last season's blueprints and OUTCOMES, but they MUST BE DONE BY THE HAND OF THE LORD, not by ours. As we enter Yom Kippur in September watch for things to begin to move and fall into place. I believe we are entering a jubilee in the church of massive proportions. God is restoring the; Voice of the church Influence of the church Power and authority of the church Storehouse of the church Territory of the church. All that has been robbed and stolen in your life is about to begin to shift because God is re-aligning us to be the head and not the tail, above only and not beneath. That is why right now you're feeling so restless and longing for the breakthrough more than you ever have. That is why the enemy is trying to bombard you on all sides with weariness, frustration, and feeling like you just want to give up and settle. Yes, you could settle. It's so easy right now to go back. It's so easy right now to camp in the place of second best, but is that really the path that God has for you? Could you really be content in second best when God has been showing you his purposes and his plans for so long? Could you really settle there? I believe we're entering into the fulfillment era of the church and even right now as you're reading this, I pray that all the hope deferred and the weariness that has been resting on you begins to shift. I feel like people right now reading this are in the 11th hour in three specific areas. I know there are more, but these are the three specific areas that the Lord spoke to me about and these are the three areas where the enemy is trying to lure us into temptation because these are three areas that God is about to bust and break through in the months ahead. POSITIONING The first is positioning. Many have been feeling the intense desire to be settled and positioned after all these years. It feels like movement and migration is still upon us and we are longing to be settled and established. The enemy has been warring for so long against this with false hopes, false foundations, and leading us to places of instability instead of the promise. Do not settle right now for Ishmael with the location that God has for you. He's repositioning you, but if you hustle right now and if you get ahead of God, you will set up camp in a place that is not conducive to the calling of God upon your life. Do not settle for Ishmael regarding your positioning. Wait for the Lord, wait for his timing. PROVISION The second area is provision. For so long, the pioneers have been reliant on manna from heaven to survive. You've seen ridiculous miracles, faith, favor, and food coming into the mouths of ravens in the wilderness. You've seen it all, but in the last six months, especially, God has been stirring your heart to believe for the impossible. He's been stirring your heart to believe for unfathomable provision for the vision that he's given you. He's exploded your imagination and your mind and had you dreaming of land and being able to build and construct a specific blueprint that he's placed on the inside of you. But when you look in your bank, and when you look in your pockets, it just doesn't match up. And there is a temptation right now to just settle, to go backward, to do what you can manage and what you can do. Let me make this very clear. Do not settle for Ishmael regarding provision. Do not go backward, for I believe in the next few months we are going to see the beginning of a wave of wealth for the harvest. If you think the wiping of debts is a huge thing, you wait and see what's coming, for God is not only going to settle debts but He is about to flood your life with provision so that not only can you be a sower and a lender, but that you can build and construct everything that God told you that you would build. God is right now breaking that poverty mentality off you. I feel like there are even many who've been holding onto their seed and their bread, and the Lord says to you today \"Release it! Release it today by faith, and watch me provide and bring in the provision!\" Do something today to break the dam walls and confront that survival mentality the enemy has tried to place upon you in the last few months. PURPOSE The last area I heard was purpose. God has been increasing your spiritual and governmental capacity and He has placed a new mantle upon you for nations, but there's been a major war on your voice, your message, and your purpose. There's been a war at your path and launching what God has given you to step into. The enemy has tried to make you push down the doors that only God can open or he has wanted you to settle for a role that is far less than the role that he has for you. Many right now are nervously trying to find some plow to put their hands to, and the Lord says, \"Do not touch that plow unless I give it to you. Do not place your hands upon it unless I put it in your hands right now!\" \"Do not sign that contract or agreement without me!\" Even men are seeking you out to put you to work for their devices to build the empires. But the lord says, \"Do not enter into that project or role unless I command you!\" For in this hour, it is so easy to choose something that is conceived by the hands of man and that is manufactured out of your need to feel settled and stable. \"But now watch,\" says the Lord, \"as I bring it to pass. I want you to step in back into rest, says the Lord. I want you to step back into synergy with my heart and my promises and my purposes and my timing!\" says the Lord. \"I want you to rest in me and as you rest in my faith, you'll tap into my miracle-working power that will unleash all that is in your heart and all that is in your mind and all that you have desired\" \"Sarah's faith embraced God's miracle power to conceive even though she was barren and was past the age of childbearing, for the authority of her faith rested in the One who made the promise, and she tapped into his faithfulness\" Hebrews 11:11 \"For pioneers, what is on your heart, I placed there. It is not of your own making. I put it inside you for a reason and I did not lead you on this path just for it to fail now or to return void\" \"No, it shall accomplish all that I desired for it to accomplish. So right now, do not settle for second best. Do not make decisions ahead of me. Do not jump ahead of my directions. Do not step into alignments that are never ordained for you\" \"Do not create messes and situations birthed out of your need and desire to help me out. I do not need help, says the Lord. I just need your yes. I do not need your networking and your orchestrating and your manufacturing. I just need your surrender now. Watch me do it, says "}
