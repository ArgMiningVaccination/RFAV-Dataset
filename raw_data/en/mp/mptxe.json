Phyllis Stearner Changes in membrane permeability have been described as an early effect of radiation in various biological systems. Decrease in intradermal pres sure in rat skin and the cock's comb immediately after X-irradiation has been recorded; ( l) increased vascular permeability to dyes that bind protein has been observed in the irradiated rabbit( 2) and rat; (3) and in\u00ad stances of radiation-induced cell swelling have been described. (4) In the chick, permeability changes leading to critical circulatory insufficiency have been identified in connection with the mitial rad1ation mortality re\u00ad sponse (within 2 days after exposure); decrease in circulating blood volume and severe hypotension have been reported.( 5,6) The present investiga\u00ad tions are concerned with early postirradiation changes in concentration of the principal plasma proteins (within 6 hr after exposure) and their pos\u00ad sible significance in the early lethality. Methods Three -day-old chicks were exposed to total body 'Y -irradiation from a 5000-curie Co60 source. A single dose of 400 r, 700 r, or 1200 r was used, and the total exposure time in each case was 10 min. After irradia\u00ad tion chicks were kept in brooders maintained at about 35\u00b0C, with free ac\u00ad cess to food and water. Blood samples for plasma protein determinations were taken from both control and irradiated chicks by a standard proce\u00ad dure. After the animal had been weighed and lightly anesthetized with ether, the heart was exposed and at least 0. 5 cc blood was withdrawn into a slightly heparinized syringe. The animal was then killed and necropsied, with grossly visible lesions recorded. The blood sample was transferred to a hematocrit tube and centrifuged for 30 min at 4500 rpm After the hematocrit value had been read, the plasma was stored at -8\u00b0C. At least 6 chicks were used for each sampling time in each dose group. A total of 122 irradiated and 23 control chicks was sampled. Plasma samples were brought to room temperature and 0. 0 1-ml aliquots were taken for determination of total protein concentration and for electrophoretic separation of major protein components. Total plasma protein was measured by the method of Lowry et al., (7) employing Folin\u00ad Ciocalteau phenol reagent. One-half hour after the reagent was added the samples were read in a Coleman Jr. spectrophotometer at 700 mf..L and compared with a bovine serum albumin standard curve. Standard solutions were prepared fresh each day. The protein components of the plasma were 5 6 the Spinco paper-strip electrophoresis method, using the standard procedure B as described in the Spinco Model R Instruction Man\u00ad ual. (8) The relative concentrations of the protein components were evalu\u00ad ated on the Analytrol (Model RB). From the integrated areas under the curve and total plasma protein concentration, absolute concentration s of the protein fractions were calculated. Results In the 3-day chick the total plasma protein concentration is 3. 62 g%, of which 1. 53 g% is albumin and the remainder globulin. Total globulin can be separated into a, {3, and 'Y fractions, but the concentrations of the a and {3 fractions are relatively small and variable. Therefore, only total globu\u00ad lin values will be considered. The effect of irradiation on total protein, albumin, and globulin concentrations is shown in Table 1. After exposure to 400 r, the total pro\u00ad tein concentration shows little change, while after 700 r the concentration falls gradually, reaching a low of 1.87 g% at 6 hr. After exposure to 1200 r, however, the protein concentration falls more rapidly, and is approximately 50% of normal ( 1. 80 g%) at 3 hr. The albumin fraction shows little change after 400 r. After 700 r the concentration slowly falls to about half the control level (0. 71 g%) at the end of the 6-hr period, but after 1200 r it de\u00ad creases to 0.45 g% within 3 hr. Changes in concentration of globulins are less marked. After 400 r there is little change, while in the other two dose groups there is a slow decrease in concentration.

Although determinations of plasma volume were not made on these animals, the .. .... -. . . increase in hematocrit values after 3-6 hr indicates that plasma volume has decreased. Plasma volumes have been calculated (Table 3), assuming a constant red cell mass and a total blood volume 6. 5% of the body weight.* The estimated decrease after 1200 r is especially marked, but probably represents an underestimate of the true decrease in plasma volume. Evi\u00ad dence of hemorrhage, frequently seen after 3 hr, indicates that there is also a decrease in the circulating red cell mass and, therefore, an even greater decrease in circulating plasma volume.

The response resembles that based on concentration but the changes are more profound. For example, within 3 hr after 1200 r, the quantity of circulating albumin falls to less than 20% of the control value (Figure 1), while globulins fall to less than 40% (Figure 2). The ap\u00ad parent increase in plasma proteins at 6 hr after exposure to 1200 r prob\u00ad ably reflects selection within the irradiated group, due to deaths that occurred before 6 hr, rather than an actual increase in concentration. !10 --- - 400r 0 600r x 1200r 40 )( 0 t ' Control 30f- e 0 D 0 2 201-)( 0 I 0 -I 0 10 0 I )( X )( )( l 00 I I I I I 2 3 4 5 6 7 T1me after uposure, l'lr Ftgure 1.

Survival within 8 hr after CoSO 'Y-irradiation (exposure time = 10 min). range ( 1-99% mortality) for Co60 'Y-irradiation delivered over short exposure times is approximately 700-1200 r. Survival within 8 hr after irradiation is shown in Fig\u00ad ure 3. It is only after 1200 r that mortality is high and deaths begin to occur before 3 hr. A marked decrease in albumin occurs at 2 hr in this exposure group. Al\u00ad though the albumin concentration at 6 hr after 700 r is comparable to that in the group exposed to 1200 r, the rate of decrease is much slower (Figure 1). The effect on the quantity of circulating globulins is similar but somewhat less drastic. No change in the quantity of circu\u00ad lating protein was noted after the 11 sublethal11 exposure of 400 r. After irradiation over short exposure periods with doses in the lethal range for the initial response, it appears that there are severe early changes in permeability of the capillary endothelium leading to decreased plasma protein concentration and plasma volume. Preliminary results with doses protracted over longer exposure times indicate that the per\u00ad meability change is dependent on exposure time. A dose of 1000 r delivered in 8 hr or 2300 r delivered in 17.6 hr is followed by little or no change in plasma proteins. (9) References l. Brinkman, R. and H. B. Lamberts.

Sacher, Douglas Grahn, and Robert J. Robertson A little more than four years ago, the first replication of guinea pigs was entered into a program of periodic duration-of-life 'Y-ray expo\u00ad sure at levels ranging from 1.3 to 36 r per week. Since the last progress report( 1) enough data have accumulated to permit a preliminary analysis of the effects on the mortality curve. The exposure and control conditions and other features of the ex\u00ad periment are given in Table 4. Animals in exposed groups received their exposures on 1 to 6 nights each week, depending on the exposure pattern. Exposures were delivered to the guinea pigs in their living cages, and were given over a 12-to 15-hr period beginning at 6 P.M. The remaining days of the week were spent in the animal quarters, side by side on the same racks with the control pigs. Half of the control pigs were stationary, i.e., remained in the animal quarters, while the other half were mobile, i.e., were moved to a position in the gamma room corridor and returned to the home room each week. Subgroups of the mobile group matched the various fractionation patterns of the exposed groups. Analysis of the control data revealed that the stationary and mobile controls had almost identical mor\u00ad tality experience, so the control data are given here for the pooled group of 120 animals.

The survival of controls is comparable to that for Lorenz's inbred pigs and inferior to the survival of his hybrid group. (2) The survival of the treatment groups at 350, 700, and 1050 days after onset of exposure is tabulated in Table 5. Mean after-survival times are recorded for groups in which dying-out was complete. Age-specific mortality rates are recorded for 350-day intervals up to 1400 days.

Mortality rates were computed by the formula: D(t) = ln (t + h/2) = t::, ln N The quantity n is the mean death rate in the interval (t-hj2, t + h/2), and should not be confused with the actuary's death rate, qx = !::, NjN, which is not an estimate of the mean rate and which is seriously biased when percent mortality in an interval becomes appreciable, as it must in small samples. The n values are plotted in Figure 4 on a logarithmic scale versus age, to yield the Gompertz transforms for the 7 experimental groups. The following features may be noted. l. The Gompertz transform (G. T.) for controls is slightly convex upward, but does not depart significantly from linearity, and has a doubling time very near to 300 days. 11 12 . . 2. The G. T. for l. 35 r /week is not significantly different from control. 3. The G. T. for 5.4 r/week lies below the control G. T. in all 4 time intervals; the reduction of mortality in the 5.4 r /week group is highly significant. 4. The set of G. T. 's for the 5.4, 13, 24 , and 36 r/week groups are steeper than the control G. T., and essentially parallel one to another; the doubling time for these groups is roughly 200 days. a: 10 06 03 r----------- --- --- ------ --, I I I I I I I I v I I I I I I I I /' I I I , I I I ,\"\"' . / '/ ;\"' \u00b7y / I / / I I I I I I / /,A / w 01 I I I >\u00ad .... ..J I :! 006 J / / / :I / / / / C.Or>trol US r II x 24rl ValuH- 0 _j_ ..L -'- ---' --'----'----' 100 450 BOO 150 AGE, days 1500 Figure 4. Mortality rates (on a logarithmic-scale) versus age. Rates are plotted at midpoint of interval for which they were computed. The predicted control points are an extrapola\u00ad tion, to zero dose rate, of the mortality rates observed in the exposed groups. The \"Lorenz hybrid\" line is an inde\u00ad pendent visual estimate of the mortality rate trend observed in a group of hybrid guinea pigs maintained by Lorenz. In Figure 5, the D values are plotted on a log scale versus exposure dose per week. One notes that in the range from 5.4 through 36 r /week the curves are approximately parallel one to another, and from 5.4 through 24 r/week they are approximately linear. The dashed lines indicate ap\u00ad proximately how the log mortality rate versus daily dose functions would continue below 5.4 r/week if the relation of injury to daily dose were linear down to zero, and the solid symbols on the ordinate are then the expected control mortality rates on the linear hypothesis. These symbols are re\u00ad produced in Figure 4. The straight line passing through them is an inde\u00ad pendent visual estimate of the straight line fitting the G.

Solid symbols with dashed lines represent pre\u00ad dicted control values obtained by extrapolation to zero dose. Discussion These data give evidence for the following propositions about the effects of periodic duration-of-life exposure on guinea pigs. 1. The parallelism of the G. T.'s for the levels 5.4 through 36 r/ week bears out the hypothesis that the mortality of periodically exposed guinea pigs arises from an injury process in a physiological system which is extremely sensitive to radiation damage, but which equilibrates recovery with injury within a comparatively few months after the beginning of expo\u00ad sure. This is one of the hypotheses that the experiment was set up to test. lA. As a corollary to l:, the parallelism also signifies that there is as yet no evidence for a nonrecovering component of radiation injury in the guinea pig. This is not entirely surprising, for if a nonrecovering 13 14 . ..... . 0 component existed, and had a dosage sensitivity about that of this nonre\u00ad covering component in the mouse, it would be difficult to detect in the pres\u00ad ence of the large steady-state component of injury demonstrated here. Estimation of the irreparable component will require special procedures, such as carefully chosen terminated exposures. The terminated exposures employed by Lorenz were too large (or too intense) for this purpose. 2. The near-linearity of the diagram of log n versus weekly ex\u00ad posure dose (Figure 5) suggests that the injury produced is a linear function of weekly dose. In other words, the Blair -Sacher linear hypotheses are ap\u00ad parently valid for this injury process and exposure level. More convincing information would have to come from analysis of directly observed physio\u00ad logical damage, e.g., blood counts. Counts were not taken on the guinea pigs in the present experiment, but comparison of the mortality statistics reported here with the thorough hematological studies done by Lorenz al. should be revealing 3 The data for 5.4-r /week and control groups provide an unequiv- ocal instance of improved survival resulting from maintained periodic ex\u00ad posure. The exposed and control groups were sampled nearly proportionally from 5 replications set up over a period of one year. In every replication, the 5 4-r /week group had survival equal to or better than its specific repli\u00ad cation control The two exposure groups were housed in close propinquity 3 days of each week Mobile controls were employed but as noted above, movement had no effect on survival. The superiority oi the 5.4-r/week group is manifest over a 4-year period, and there are no evidences of epi\u00ad demic death in the control groups. An important feature in the present experiment is the housing of guinea pigs, two to a plastic cage. It soon became apparent that these conditions were suboptimal The housing may have created the conditions for excess control mortality which seemingly must be present if a beneficial effect of a low maintained exposure is to appear. However, the same pattern of control mortality in excess of that in low-level exposed groups was presented by Lorenz' inbred guinea pigs. In his hybrid guinea pigs, on the other hand, the controls had an excellent survival record with virtually no early death, and here there was a linear decrement of survival with daily dose which held down to zero dose. 4. The control survival \"predicted\" by linear extrapolation of the data from exposed groups (Figures 4 and 5) agrees quite well with the sur\u00ad vival observed in Lorenz hybrid controls. These predicted values are the behavior expected in a hypothetical control population free of the excess mortality which by hypothesis is greatly reduced or abolished by optimal maintained exposures. It is indeed fortunate that the predicted G. T. can be matched with an observed one, for without such confirmation, the extrapo\u00ad lation would be much less credible. The data from the present experiment and the data obtained by Lorenz are consistent to an astonishing degree. This encourages the belief that we will eventually attain a correct under\u00ad standing of the mechanisms underlying the high radiosensitivity of the . effect of fractionation pattern on mortality can be read di- rectly from a comparison of the 3 G. T. curves in the upper left of Figure 4. It can be seen that 24 r given in one session per week is almost exactly equal in effect to 36 r given in 6 fractions of 6 r each, that is, a 4-fold in\u00ad crease in dose per fraction leads to a 1.5-fold increase in effectiveness. The analysis and interpretations presented here are preliminary and subject to correction. They are discussed at length because of the im\u00ad portance of these observations for the design of the experimental program for the reactor JANUS. It is now evident that the guinea pig provides favor\u00ad able conditions for study of injury-lethality relations, dose-rate and frac\u00ad tionation dependence, and paradoxical improved survival. In the light of the known reactions of this species, there is reason to anticipate that interest\u00ad ing phenomena will emerge from the comparison of fast neutron and 'Y-ray exposures. It should be noted that in its response to maintained low-level exposure the guinea pig resembles the rhesus monkey more closely than any other species. References l. Sacher, G. A., D. Grahn and R.

The reci:J?rocity law in radiation dosimetry was originally for\u00ad mulated by King; ( 1) much of his work is also given in Me'(:er and von Schweidler ' s book on radioactivity. (2) Later Mayneord 3) extended the reciprocity theorem as follows: \"the integral dose throughout any volume whatever due to a finite source uniformly filled with radio\u00ad active material is equal to the integral dose through\u00ad out the original source if the 'receiver' be filled with radiating material of the same uniform density.\" In particular, if the absorbing medium has arbitrary volume but the radiation is emitted by a point sourc -:_, the true absorbed integral dose can be determined from the reciprocal situation: replace the absorber by a homogeneous* source of the same shape, and measure the radiation in\u00ad tensity at one point only, i.e. the location of the original source. It is an interesting theoretical problem to calculate the results ex\u00ad pected from either procedure. This requires evaluating the integrals given by King and Mayneord for the particular volume under consideration. Thus, for example, Kovalev(4) computed the intensity of radiation at a point, Q, due to a homogeneous cylindrical source, for. the special case when Q is lo\u00ad cated on the cylinder surface at equal distance from both ends of the cylin\u00ad der (Figure 6). In his calculations Kovalev assumes that the radioactive I ! ------\u00b7 1---------------PI 0 I I I (f') ' ' I I I I 1----+--_J- ------\u00b7Pz Figure 6 Illustrating Kovalev's calculation.

P3 if fJ. : 0. *This means having the radiating material distributed with uniform density throughout the volume. the cylinder absorbs the radiation according to the simple exponential law; the absorption coefficient is denoted by J.L. If J.L = 0, Kovalev's results also apply to points P1, P2, and P3 located as shown in Figure 6. For a spherical source similar calculations were performed more than 30 years ago by Souttar;(5 ) however, he neglected all absorption effects. We have generalized Souttar's work to include these effects. If }11 and J..Lo denote, respectively, the absorption coefficients inside and outside the sphere, the radiation intensity at a point P, Ip (J..L1, }10), is given by Ip (J..L1, J.Lo) = o + J..L1 1) (o+ 1)2 dV ' ( 1) where C is a constant,* the integration is extended to the volume of the whole sphere, and the meaning of 0, 1 is indicated in Figure 7.

However, introducing a system of polar coordinates (m, e, \u00a2) with origin at P (Figure 7), replacing 1 by m -0 and dV by m2dm sin e de d\u00a2, the integrations over \u00a2 and m can be performed at once. We then obtain sin e d9 ' (2) *Let d be the density of the radioactive material inside the sphere. Then, if a small mass, b.m, of that material were concentrated in a volume element 6.v, the intensity at unit distance from this fictitious point source in the absence of absorption would be equal to Cb.v = C/d \u00b7 6.m. 17 18 where R 60 = arc (3) (4) (5) The symbols in these equations have the following meaning (see Figure 7): a) g is the distance from the center of the sphere, 0, to the point P; b) R denotes the radius of the sphere, and .

For ex\u00ad ample, if we put cos e = u, as was done by D. V. Gopinath, Equation (2) takes the form 1 (6) with R z = - (0 < z <. l) (7) g and On the other hand, introducing 0 as a new independent variable instead of e, so that 2 g cos e and sine dB 1 --- 2g d 0 ' we find Ip ( J.L1, J.Lo) = -L + M + K ' where L, M, and K represent the following quantities: s L 52 y 2 y=a s M= e y=a s K= y=a J.Ll 52 Vy - y e dy vy-J.Ll s 2 y 52 -- l dy -J.loY e dy In these equations we have put v = J..1.1 -J.Lo and a = g-R ' ) (8) (a > 0 if the point P lies outside the sphere). Integrating by parts we see that 19 20 Furthermore, the integral K can be written in closed form as follows: l [ -J.Los -J.Loa] -J.Loa -J.Los 2 [ +be -se + J.Los Ei( -J.L0a - where b = g + R ' and the remaining Equation (9) symbols have the same meaning as before. Also, in 00 Ei(-x) = -J t=x e-t dt t (x > 0) is the exponential integral. It can be considered as a known function for all practical purposes, since extensive tables, as well as approximate formulae to compute it for very small and very large values of x, are available. (6, 7) However, there seems to be no simple expression for M, although it is interesting to note that the integrand in M is essentially equal to the generating function of Bessel coefficients.

If both media have the same absorption coefficient ( /-11) = f.Lt = f.L I -e fl ( 14) This case, however, is less likely to be met with in actual experimental situations. 3. Letting flo and fl1 tend to zero we find ' ( 15) which coincides with Souttar 's result provided we equate our constant C to his quantity p/4. (Souttar' s a corresponds to our R and his x to our g.) Remembering that z = Rjg, Equation ( 15) can also be written in the form Ip(O, 0) = 47TCR Thus, if we put ' the quantity Ip(fl1 0) k = -Ip(O, 0) 1 -- 2 ln (l+z) 1 -z ( 16) ( 1 7) ( 18) i.e., the ratio of intensities at P with and without absorption inside the sphere (if flo = 0), may be represented as a function of the two parameters z, p as follows: k = F(z, p) with ( 19) F(z, p) -vt=o \"\" - (1 - Z Z) 1 -2z ln (1+z) 1 -z .... -- 4 . -. . -. . 4. If the point P moves to Q, on the surface of the sphere, the intensity at Q becomes (20) and is, of course, independent of Jlo\u00b7 5.

In this Division, Sinclair has performed several experiments to determine the average absorbed dose of spherical (and cylindrical) speci\u00ad mens exposed to Co60 'Y-radiation. (9) He suggests that, theoretically, the effect of absorption can be taken into account as follows\u00b7 the ratio k, Equation ( 18) above, should be equal to the self-absorption coefficient for the sphere, say v, as given in Thirri ng'sand vonSchweidler'spapers. (lO,ll) While this procedure constitutes a useful approximation when R/g is small, as in Sinclair's experiments, it is not rigorously correct. In fact, the in\u00ad tensity Ip (Equation (1)], which is the appropriate quantity to use in applying the reciprocity law, refers to the amount of radiant energy absorbed by a small volume element at P, whereas the self-absorption coefficient, v, may 23 24 Figure 8. Spherical source, as in Fig\u00ad ure 7, showing details for the calculauon of the self\u00ad absorption coefficient v. . . - 0. be interpreted as the ratio of two currents. More precisely, let Q be a point on the sphere and define ' (23) where C is a constant, m = QA, r = OA (Figure 8), and the integration is extended to the whole sphere. We see that jQ{J.L1) differs from IQ( fJ.1), Equation ( 1) with P -+ Q, in that the integrand of Equation (23) contains the (m2 + R 2-r2) factor 2mR = cos A. Thus, jQ(fJ.1) is the normal component of the energy flux through an infinitesimal surface dS at Q, due to all volume elements inside the sphere. The ratio v is defined as jQ(fJ.1) divided by the same quantity for }J-1 = 0: * v - Now, j Q( {J.1) can easily be calculated: 4rrCR -- p3 On the other hand, and 3 lrr;z.

From Equation ( 19) or (20) we obtain 1 = F ( l, p) = 2 J ( l -t) e-pt dt t=o - [-l + p + e-P] -2 pz = 1 - (I() -2e-P I A=o l (A+ 2) Since we also have 00 3 -p (A.+ 4) I A=o v( p) = 2 e I A=O (A+2)(A+3) (-l)A (A+ 2)! ) (27) it is clear that, for any fixed pos1tive value of p, the right hand side of Equation (2 7) will be larger than v( p). Strictly speaking, therefore, Equations (18) and (19) should be used in applying the reciprocity theorem when f.lo = 0. Even so. of course, the results will be only approxim ately true. In particular, the three restrictive assumptions mentioned by Kovalev (Reference 4, page 116) must always be kept in mind. Von Schweidler s ratio, v( p ), a quantity which depends only on the geometry of the source and on the absorption coefficient within the source, 25 26 - - merely a number which may conveniently be used to characterize the effects of self-absorption for the source as a whole But, at least in the simple case of the sphere, a ratio such as F(l, p), Equation (2 7), could equally well serve the same purpose. Returning now to Equation ( 19), we may expand the denominator on the right hand s1de in powers of z: 2z ln(l+z)= l -z 2. (2n-1)(2n + l) n=l which shows that F(z, p) depends on z2 rather than on z itself. Then, using de 1'HG'pital's rule, we let zl tend to zero and find: -- - --3 p3 -pt e dt [-1 + 4: + ( p + l) e-P J = v( p) From this last equation it follows that, as we have already mentioned, Sinclair 1 s procedure will be applicable within the limits of experimental error if R/g is kept suff1ciently small.

Frigerio and Donn L. Jordan It has been shown that a high degree of contamination of fast neutron fluxes by thermal and epithermal neutrons is an inevitable consequence of the shielding used in fast neutron radiobiological facihtie s. ( l) The presence of such moderated neutrons is evident from the foil measurements which have been made in these fac1lities(2 -7) and is significant even in such rela\u00ad tively 11bare11 facilities as God1va. ( 8) Recent studies ( 9 1 0) have indicated that neutrons in the epithermal region (0.1 to 500,000 ev) are of consider\u00ad able biological importance and probably have RBE values higher than those characteristic of either fast or purely thermal neutrons. Further, the radio\u00ad biology of neutrons in this energy region is but poorly understood. Thus, in fast neutron studies, it would be well to eliminate, or at least minimize, contamination of fast neutron fluxes by such epithermal neutrons. Elimination of purely thermal neutrons from fast fluxes is a rela\u00ad tively simple process since thermal absorbers of high cross section are readily available. Such absorbers, placed over the neutron source and around the significant moderating shields, effectively remove all of the di\u00ad rect and reflected thermal neutrons from the fast flux. Li6 is to be preferred since it alone, of the practical thermal absorbers, produces no gamma con\u00ad tammation of the fast neutron flux. Absorbers with useful removal cross sections for epithermal neutrons are not at present available and, consequently, the absorption method is not feasible. However, at least in fission neutron facilities, the ratio of fast flux to epithermal flux delivered to a given point in the facility is primarily a function of the distance of the point from the \u00a3is sion source. Thus, it is pos\u00ad sible to minimize the epithermal contribution to the dose received by an organism in a fission neutron facility by locating the organism close to the fission source. The effects of shielding on neutron spectra are illustrated, using CP-S( 11) and the JANUS reactor as examples. To a good approximation the animal positions can be considered to lie at the center of a rectangular space with the converter at one end of the longest dimension, x, and with the center of the converter taken as the co\u00ad ordinate origin. Each thermal neutron yields 2. 5 fission neutrons ( pp. l-26 of Refer\u00ad ence 12). Thus, the converter represents a source, to the animal space, of fission neutrons of strength S0, given by (l) -- 0 0 0 \u00b0 0 0 .... . - 0 - 0 0. 0 0 0 . - 0 0 0 \u00b7- - Here a 1s the effect1ve radius of the converter plate, \u00a2Th the thermal flux at the plate, Lf the macroscopic f1ssion cross section of the plate, and h its thickness_ The fission neutron flux, \u00a2f, at the animal position at distance d from the converter plate is then given by( l3) So d2 + a2 \u00a2f - -- ln 47J'az d2 (2) At the sh1eld walls the fiss10n flux rap1dly suffers random moderation and reflect10n so that <tm\u00b7 the mean moderated flux at the animal space after n reflectlons from the wall, is given by z {33 {3n {3 + .. . . ) (3) Here {3 is the fraction reflected from the shield walls, usually called the albedo (pp. 6-41 of Reference 12) and b the mean distance from the walls to the animal position. In the real case n is very large and {3< l so that Equation (3) reduces to (4) for large values of n. This moderated flux will add to the fission flux by causing new fis\u00ad sions at the converter plate. The mean flux of new fission neutrons from - this source, \u00a2f1 , is g1ven by I ( h)] cross sectlon for moderated fission neutrons. ( 5) For a small converter plate located close to the an1mal position, the thermal entry port simply represents a thermal source of strength \u00a2Th nc2, where c is the effective radius of the port since no fission multiplication occurs at the port Although no further moderation can occur in the com\u00ad pletely moderated thermal neutrons, reflection results in a thermal flux at the small converter plate close to the animal position which is given by an equation of the form of Equation (3). Hence, the small plate is a source of I strength S0, given by 29 30 -- s = - \"-\u00b7 0 \u00b0 0 0 - For large values of n this reduces to s - - l l l -f3 . . . .. as before, and S may be substituted for S0 in Equations (2) through (5). ( 6) (7) The results of calculations for the two conditions (a) large plate\u00ad large distance and (b) small plate-small distance are presented in Table 6 for JAI\\US and for CP-5. It can be seen that condition (b) results in a much higher ratio of fission flux to moderated flux at the animal pos1tion than does cond1t1on (a). Thus condition (b) is much to be preferred for investigations of the effects of undegraded f1ssion spectra TABLE 6 Calculated and observed fission neutron fluxes and moderated neutron fluxes at CP-5 and JANUS under condition (a) (large converter plate -large distance to exposure position) and under condition (b) (small plate -small distance).

It proved possible to check this conclusion experimentally at the CP-5 facility. Known masses of gold and sulfur, with and without cadmium casings, were exposed in the facility under the normal operating conditions of a 1650 -cm2 converter plate 150 em from the animal position. The boral shutter and plate were removed, and the pile was operated at 4. 6 megawatts. Then the large converter plate was replaced by an 81-cm2 plate 1 em from the animal position, and a new set of gold and sulfur foils was exposed as before. Thermal, epithermal and fast fluxes were computed as in previous studies, ( l) and the results are also presented in Table 6. Despite the sim\u00ad plifying assumptions necessary in the derivations and the crudity of foil measurements for spectral studies, the agreement is surprisingly good. From the form of the various equations it can be seen that the critical parameters are a and d. Thus, for a given facility, some optimum combination of these must exist which will yield the highest fission flux and lowest moderated flux. This can be estimated from the equations given, and checked, where appropriate, by foil measurements. References 1. Frigerio, N. A Moderated neutron flux.

Over the past several years a series of reports has appeared show\u00ad ing that total-body uradiation of young female Sprague-Dawley rats w1th single sublethal doses of X-or gamma radiation resulted in the production of numerous mammary gland neoplasms. ( 1 ,2.) The response to total- body irradiation appeared to be dose-dependent in the range studied (2.5-400 r).(2.) The present experiments were designed (a) to compare the relative effects of two external radiations, f1ssion neutrons and Cow gamma rays, on the induction of mammary neoplasms in this rat, (b) to study the effects of dif\u00ad ferent dose- rates of these radiations on this end-pomt, and (c) to extend observations on the incidence and frequency of these neoplasms, as well as to obtain longev1ty data in irradiated and control rats.(3) Materials and Methods Animals The animals used were young female Sprague-Dawley rats bred at Argonne Natwnal Laboratory; the original breeding colony ( 11 specif1c\u00ad pathogen-free\") was started with Sprague-Dawley rats taken by cesarean section and fostered by Lobund 11 germ-free 11 mothers. ( 4) All rats used in this experiment were taken from litters born during the same week ( 1/10/60 -1/16/60). After weaning, the female rats were isolated in an animal room for a period of several weeks before be1ng randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. The first irradiation was carried out when the animals were approx1mately 60 days old. Irrad1atwn F1ssion neutrons. F1fty-seven rats in four dose-rate groups were irradiated w1th 100 rads of fission neutrons once a week for four weeks. The intens1tles used were 1, 3 .. 6, and 3 5 rads/min. Thus the rats received a total of 400 rads of neutrons but each weekly fraction was a brief exposure lasting only from 3 to 85 minutes, depending on the dose rate. Rats were exposed m spec1al rotation cages, 8 or 9 together, as prevwusly described. ( 5) The four neutron dose rates were obtained by vary1ng the size of the opening in a boral shutter w1thin the thermal column of the CP-5 reactor (2.5o/o, 50o/o or 1 OOo/o open) and by removing the shutter completely. This controlled the number of thermal neutrons allowed to reach a uranium con\u00ad verter plate, the source of the fission neutrons, thus changing the flux and intens1ty. 33 34 -\u00b7 Co60 gamma irradiat ion. Gamma-irradiated rats were also divided into four dose -rate groups ( 1, 3, 6 and 35 rads/min ). They were exposed to 200 rads of Co60 gamma rays once a week for four weeks. Exposures to both neutrons and gamma rays were made in the gamma-neutron radiation chamber( 6) at CP-5, with the exception of the highest gamma-ray dose rate, for which the High-Level Gamma Room( 7) was used, since this intensity could not be attained in the CP-5 gamma chamber. The other three gamma-ray dose rates were achieved by vary\u00ad ing the distance between the animal exposure position and 18 Co60 sources. (6) The weekly exposures to gamma rays took from 6 minutes to more than 3 hours. All animals were maintained in temperature-controlled rooms (74 \u00b1 3\u00b0F) and were given food and water ad libitum. Mortality checks were made twice a day. Every two weeks, the rats were examined carefully for palpable mammary tumors, and growth of tumors was measured with calipers. Animals were weighed once a month. Each rat was necropsied, but no histological work was carried out in this experiment, since the pathology and relative frequency of mammary neoplasms in this rat strain has been studied intensively by other investigators. (2, 8, 9) Results The regime of fractionated radiation exposures used in this experi\u00ad ment produced a large number of mammary tumors. Of 112 irradiated rats, 92% had palpable mammary neoplasms. The incidence of these tumors, for all dose-rate groups and both radiations, is listed in Table 7. It is clear from these data that the incidence of neoplasms is very high, that the latent period is not long, and that the process is a continuing one. Mammary tumors began to appear in each of the irradiated groups within 70 days after the first exposure, and new tumors continued to appear in the irradi\u00ad ated rats throughout their lives. The longest time from first irradiation to palpable mammary tumor in this series of rats was 569 days.

In Figure 9 the cumulative incidence (%) of rats with mammary tumors is plotted against time in months after first irradiation. It is clear from this graph that the neutron-irradiated rats had a shorter latent period and an \"increased tumor rate over most of their life span. This is interest\u00ad ing since the neutron dose in rads was only half that given the gamma\u00ad irradiated animals. Clearly, the RBE (n/gamma) for this endpoint is greater than 2. - :.3:: 30 ::> u 20 10 00 X I lj I X o I X I X I X ,X I /,i \u00b7?

In Figure 10 the cumulative mortality is plotted against time, for the 26-month period after first exposure, with the dose-rate groups com\u00ad bined. These mortality data indicate that the neutrons are more effective than the gamma rays, even though the total neutron dose was less by a factor of two. The RBE for this second endpoint must also exceed 2. It is interesting to note that the RBE (n/gamma) for acute 30 -day mortality in the female mouse ( CF N\"o. l) under these experimental conditions was re\u00ad ported to be 2. 7.(5) Of the control unirradiated rats, 65% were alive after 2 years. When this graph was constructed, 800 days after first exposure, 13 of the 35 control rats were still alive. During the course of this experi\u00ad ment we had no difficulties with epizootic infections or the respiratory in\u00ad fections common in many rat colonies. (9) In Table 8 are listed the survivorship data for the 8 dose-rate groups of irradiated animals. The numbers in each dose-rate group are small, but there is no evidence that a change in intensity causes any significant difference in life span in either the neutron- or the gamma-irradiated rats.

The mortality rate was calculated as the ratio between the number of rats dying within periods of 100 days, and the number of rats alive at the beginning of each 100-day period. This table demon\u00ad strates that the neutron-irradiated rats died early (only 5 rats in this group survived past the fifth 100-day period). It is apparent that by 500-600 days, when mortality rates are very high among irradiated rats, the controls are not yet dying in large numbers.

The data on probability of tumor formation per period are given in Table 10 for both irradiated and control animals. It appears that an ir\u00ad radiated rat has 2 to 3 chances in 10 to develop a mammary tumor during each 100-day period from 100-500 days after first exposure. During this same time the probability that mammary tumors will appear in the control rats is extremely low.

In a few cases, mortality followed rapidly (within a few weeks) after the tumor was first seen. However, in most cases there was a definite steady growth of the tumor, often with new turl?-ors appearing in different sites. Of the neutron-irradiated rats, 76% died between 51 and 200 days after the tumor first appeared. Similarly, 70o/o of the gamma-jrradiated rats died between 51 and 250 days after first observed tumor. Thus, in these Sprague-Dawley female rats, in most cases 2 to 7 or 8 months were required for the mam\u00ad mary tumor to grow large enough to cause the death of the rat. - -. . - .

Many of the rats developed more than one mammary tumor. The data for multiple tumors are listed in Table 12.

In both the neutron- and gamma irrad1ated animals, an over-all average of 1.5 tumors per rat was observed.

LETHALITY OF FRACTIONATED DOSES OF FISSION NEUT RONS AND C060 GAMMA RAYS IN MICE Donn L. Jordan and Howard H. Vogel, Jr. The low-level face of the JANUS reactor was designed to permit exposure of animals to extremely low dose rates of fission neutrons; in\u00ad tensities of less than one rad per week should be possible. To obtain some preliminary information to aid in the experimental de sign for animal ir\u00ad radiation at JANUS, a series of exposures has been carried out at the CP-5 reactor. The fission neutron facility at CP-5 was de signed primarily for sin le acute exposures.(!) At present, neutron dose rates from 1 to 100 rads/ minute are utilized, with the reactor operating at the standard 4. 6 mega\u00ad watts; although continuous exposures at low dose rates over extended periods are not possible, a dose rate of 1 rad/min can be obtained by closing completely aboral shutter in the thermal column of this reactor.(2) This reduces to a minimum the number of thermal neutrons reaching the uranium converter plate and decreases the resultant flux of fission neutrons. In the present experiment CF No. 1 female mice were exposed to 300 rads of Co60 )'-rays or to 60 rads of fission neutrons each week for 13 weeks. The total weekly dose was delivered in 1, 3, or 6 equal frac\u00ad tions for each radiation (Table 13). For these exposures the relative biological effectiveness (RBE ) between neutrons and )'-rays was assumed to be 5 (300 rads:60 rads). The RBE for single acute exposures for this mouse at this facility has been reported to be 2.8,(3) but there is consider\u00ad able evidence that it is higher when animals are irradiated at low rates over longpcriods.(4) The exposure times were brief (10 min to 5 hr) since the dose rate was approximately 1 rad per min of either fission neutrons or )'-rays. TABLE 13 Exposure condi tions 50 300 3900 24 3 100 300 3900 24 1 300 300 3900 24 0 0 0 0 Fission neutrons 32 6 10 60 780 32 3 20 60 780 32 1 60 60 780 16 0 0 0 0 41 42 ' . ' . Mortality figures for the first 100 days following the initial exposure are given in Table 14. It is apparent that the total 'Y-ray dose was much more lethal than the corresponding neutron dose. The RBE appears to be considerably less than 5 and may be about the same as that found after single acute exposures of the two radiations.

It is possible that a lower thermal flux may be obtained at CP-5 by increasing the amount of moderating graphite in the thermal column in front of the boral shutter. Experiments are now being planned, utilizing this condition for achieving lower dose rates, to compare the effects of fractionation and protraction of these radiations. References 1. Vogel, H.

Jordan When mice are exposed to single acute doses of ionizing radiations, one of the most obvious pathological syndromes resulting is the lymphoid neoplasm. These tumors in mice, often termed lympoid leukemias, have many of the characteristics of lymphosarcomas. Leukemic cells may or may not be present in the peripheral blood. The thymus gland often has a central role in the development of murine leukemia, ( 1 2) and when it is enlarged, the pathology has been described as thymic lrmphoma(3 ) although most workers attempt to follow Dunn s classification( 4 of reticular tumors in the mouse. Materials and Methods Young adult female mice of strain CF No. 1 {Carworth Farms, N.Y.) were isolated in one animal room when 5-6 weeks of age and used when approximately 100 days old. Since there is evidence that fractionation or intermittent delivery of a given radiation dose is more leukemogenic than the same total dose given at one time, ( S, 6) the exposures were carried out over a 21-day period {Table 15). Mice were irradiated at weekly intervals with either 100 rads fission neutrons or 200 rads -y-rays at 4 different dose rates.

Incidence of Thymic Tumors Unirradiated control mice. Thymic tumors were observed at autopsy mainly toward the end of the life span: of 10 controls examined between 572 and 637 days, 7 showed thymic enlargement. Of the other 3, one died with a rectal neoplasm, one with lung tumors, and one was undiagnosed. Thymic tumors are relatively rarer in young CF No. 1 female mice, but they appear to be common as the mice approach 3 years of age. Irradiated mice. Table 16 gives thymic tumor incidence in the ir\u00ad radiated animals: of 82 mice, exposed to one or the other radiation and necropsied between 90 and 221 days after the last exposure, 80% showed TABLE 16 Thymic tumor incidence observed in female CF No. 1 mice at autopsy* (90 -221 days after last irradiation ) Dose rate, of possible. grossly glands. Thus thymic tumors, with or without in\u00ad volvement of other reticular tissues, comprise the chief cause of death in this period in all dose-rate groups for both radiations (Figure 13). Figure 13.

The earliest case was ob\u00ad served 53 days after irradiation; the latest appeared after 415 days. Four cases were observed before 90 days, but only 10 were seen more than 200 days after irradiation. Thus the peak of thymic tumor incidence here is at 3-7 months after the last exposure (Table 17).

The present experiment supports this concept indirectly; there appears to be a significant difference between mean survival times of the extreme dose-rate groups ( 1 rad/min and 35 rads/min), and thymic tumor is the chief cause of death in all groups tested. However, further work must be undertaken with larger numbers of animals and a wider range of radiation intensities before a definitive answer can be given to this problem. References 1. Duhig, J.

PROGRESS REPORT DISEASES OF LABORATORY ANIMALS During the period covered by this report, our efforts were confined principally to three projects: 1) the organizing and editlng of a text on lab\u00ad oratory animal diseases, 2) a study to determine whether hamsters are sus\u00ad ceptible to or can act as passive carriers of ectromelia virus, and 3) studies of a disease of mice that was first recognized in our animal quarters in Feb\u00ad ruary 1962 The progress of the first of these three projects continues satis\u00ad factorily. Details concerning the other two are given below. Lack of Susceptibility of the Syrian Hamster to Ectromelia Virus Robert J. Flynn and Isabel L. Greco The Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) has proved to be ex\u00ad tremely useful in cancer research as an experimental host for heterologous transplantations both of animal and human neoplasms. Tumors from colonies of laboratory mice in which ectromelia is enzootic may be infected with this virus. (!) For this reason, and also because the two species are frequently maintained in close proximity, it became important to know whether hamsters are susceptible to ectromelia virus. A group of hamsters, some vaccinated and some unvaccinated, were, therefore, challenged with the virus. For com\u00ad parative purposes, some vaccinated and unvaccinated mice were also challenged. Materials and Methods The hamsters used were females, 3 to 4 weeks old, obtained from Pied Piper Farms, Inc., Newark, Delaware. The mice were 5-to 6-week\u00ad old CF# 1/ Anl females. The hamsters were housed individually in plastic cages. The mice were housed in stainless steel cages, usually 5 vaccinated and 5 unvaccinated mice per cage, but occasionally 7 or 8 unvaccinated mice per cage. All were given water and Wayne Lab Blox ad libitum. The mice and hamsters to be vaccinated were inoculated with the IHD- T strain of vaccinia virus by intradermal scarification near the base of the tail, 3 weeks prior to challenge with ectromelia virus. The ectromelia virus used was a strain recovered from a natural outbreak that occurred at Argonne National Laboratory in 1959.

On the day the mice and hamsters were to be challenged, 2 moribund mice that had been inoculated with the ectro\u00ad melia virus 4 days earlier were killed. The livers were each homogenized in 2 5 ml of sterile isotonic saline solution, pooled, centrifuged at 2 780 x g for 15 min, and filtered through a Millipore HA filter (pore size 0.45 !J. \u00b1 0. 02 !J.). To the original filtrate (referred to here as 10\u00b0) was added sterile isotonic saline solution to ml intradermally in the footpads. Hamsters were given 0.1 ml of the higher concentrations only, intraperitoneally or intradermally in the footpads. All animals were observed daily for three weeks. On the 21st day all survivors were anesthetized with ether and exsanguinated by cutting the brachial artery, and serum samples were examined individually for evidence of ectromelia -produced antibodies. Hemagglutinin inhibition (HAl) titrations were made using a 1 o/o sus\u00ad pension of chicken red blood cells and a dilution of vaccinia hemagglutinin (HA) prepared from the Levaditi on the chorioallantoic mem\u00ad brane of embryonated hens' eggs. 1) If were found, a 1:10 dilution of the serum was heated in a waterbath to 56\u00b0C for 30 min and re\u00ad tested; the heating inactivates a nonspecific inhibitor of vaccinia HA that may be present in serum.

It appears hardly conceivable that they could function either as natural hosts or reservoirs for this virus. It was shown also that mice vaccinated with IHD- T strain vaccinia virus can withstand challenge with many lethal doses of the virus. *Since vaccination of mice with IHD- T strain vaccinia does not produce HAl antibodies, it does not preclude use of the HAl test for diagnosis of ectromelia infection .in such mice. ( A Disease of Mice Characterized by Lung Congestion Robert J. Flynn, Isabel L. Greco, and Patricia B. Jmkins In February, 1962, a group of about 100 CF#l/Anl female m1ce, 6-7 months of age, developed an illness clinically characterized by sudden decrease in the consumption of food and water, listlessness, and loss of weight. The condition lasted for about 2 weeks during which time a total of 7 animals died. Necropsy disclosed congested lungs and a completely empty gastrointestinal tract. No other gross abnormalities were noted. A similar 1llness appeared about 2 weeks later in another mouse room housing about 1200 CF#l/Anl female mice about 600 days of age. Within 4 days, 4 animals in a cage of 15 died. Three had congested lungs; the condition of the lungs of the fourth could not be determined because of extensive postmortem autolysis. By the next day all the animals in the room appeared to be ill. Food and water consumption were greatly de\u00ad creased. Many animals grew very thin and cyanotic, their fur became ruffled and they tended to sit hunched and isolated in corners. A few were seen leaning to one side in a manner suggesting a disturbance of the central nervous system. Within 21 days, 292 of the approximately 1200 mice died. In 206 of these, the lungs were affected. Usually all lobes were completely congested, but occasionally only part of one or more lobes, usually the dorsal part, was involved. In those dying early in the epizootic, the gastrointestinal tract was completely empty. Toward the end of the third week, a complication resem\u00ad bling paralysis of the ileum was frequently observed: the small intestine was greatly distended and filled with fluid; the colon was empty and contracted. Microscopically, the lungs of mice that died early were markedly congested and somewhat edematous. In those that died later, polymorpho\u00ad nuclear cells and macrophages were observed in great numbers in the bronchial exudate, and small necrotic areas were frequently observed in the bronchial epithelium. In some cases, slight degeneration was observed in the liver parenchyma, in the tubular epithelium of the kidneys, and in the neurons of the cerebrum. In 134 of the 292 m1ce, the only lesion noted was congested lungs. In 43, congested lungs and extensive other pathology were observed, these probably would have died within the succeeding 30 days. In 29. congested lungs were observed along with other pathology llkely to have led to death during the next 60-90 days. The remainmg 86 had no lung leswns, and their deaths were apparently unrelated to the disease. An extension of the mor\u00ad tality curve covering the prevwus 600 days indicates an expected mortality rate of about 4/day, or 84 deaths for 21 days - a figure in excellent agree\u00ad ment w1th the number of deaths apparently unrelated to the disease. 53 54 Repeated bacteriological tests were made of the lungs, livers, spleens, brains, and other tissues of the affected mice. No bacteria were recovered other than those usually considered secondary invaders. Repeated virological tests were also made. Many groups of animals of various ages were inoculated subcutaneously, mtraperitoneally, and intracerebrally with both filtered and nonfiltered homogenates of tissues from affected mice. The chorioallantoic membranes of fertile hen eggs were also inoculated with filtrates of affected tissues. All such tests were negative. We were never able to reproduce the disease and no growth oc\u00ad curred on the egg membranes. Frozen samples of affected tissues were sent to Dr. Wallace P. Rowe of the National Institutes of Health, who inoculated 20- to 21-day-old mice with filtrates of homogenates of these tissues and 3 weeks later tested their serums for antibodies of known mouse viruses. The filtrates were nonpath\u00ad ogenic for the weanling mice and negative for the viruses for which he tested (K virus, mouse adenovirus, mouse hepatitis virus, and the REO viruses). An attempt at therapy was inconclusive. Because a few animals given trial injections of oxytetracycline hydrochloride (2.5 mg/mouse/day) seemed to show improvement, all the animals in the room were treated similarly, each day, for 4 days. A few days later the mice began to eat and drink, but it is pos s1ble that the disease had run its course by the time therapy was initiated. The disease was observed shortly thereafter in 3 other animal rooms that housed younger animals, about one year of age. Food and water con\u00ad sumption decreased sharply; the animals became thin and cyanotic, but very few deaths occurred. In these rooms, the disease ran its course in about 2-4 weeks. A few animals were treated with oxytetracycline. Although the clinical signs of the disease seemed to cease after about 2-4 weeks, congested lungs were still frequently observed many weeks later. The condition now appears to be enzootic throughout the entire mouse colony. All attempts to pass this disease by animal inoculation were discontinued when it became impossible to find groups of animals free of the disease. The incidence in apparently healthy CF#l female mice raised at this Laboratory ranged from 6o/o to 22o/o. In mice of the same age, sex, and strain, received from a commercial vendor,* the incidence was zero on arrival, but ranged from 6o/o to 12o/o in groups sampled 2 weeks later. The authors wish to thank Dr. Birute 0. Biskis for her assistance in describmg the pathology observed. * Carworth, Inc., New City, Rockland County, New York. References 1. Briody, B. A.

Nonspecific inhibition of vaccinia RADIATION -INDUCED GRANULOCYTOPENI A IN SEVERAL MAMMALIAN SPECIES Harvey M. Patt and Mary A. Maloney In studies with dog and monkey,( l-3) we observed that the granu\u00ad locyte blood level could be buffered for several days by cells in the differentiating marrow pool, even if new cell formation was inhibited by X-irradiation. This followed from the findings that 1) the maturation of metamyelocyte to segmented cell proceeded in a normal fashion; 2) the release of mature cells from marrow to blood was not affected; and 3) the turnover of granulocytes in blood was also unchanged during the first few days after exposure. Thus, the delay in onset of definite granulocytopenia after irradiation is understandable, even though the normal blood turnover is only a matter of a few hours.(4 ,5) In the light of these observations, we have compared the initial granulocyte (neutrophil, heterophil) decline in several species after com\u00ad parable irradiation, using available data.

(l,ll,l2) Although this dosage covers the acute lethal range for the several species (i.e., 30-day LD0_10 for rabbits -LD100 for dogs), the granulocyte decline is strikingly similar after the variable latent period. Th1s is shown in Fig\u00ad ure 14, where the latent period has been subtracted from the time after irradiation to provide a common time axis . DAYS FROM X-RAY TO DAYS FROM ONSET OF If the survival curve for mouse bone marrow cells( l3) is applicable, fewer than 5% of cells capable of clonal growth will survive a dose of 500 to 600 rad. While the absorbed GRANULOCYTOPENIA GRANULOCYTOPENIA Figure 14. Comparison of primary granulocyto-dose (rad) will be less than the air penia in several irradiated species dose (r) used as a basis of compari- son here, it is probably sufficient in all instances to bring production to a near standstill for a time, because of cell death and the associated mitotic block. This receives support from the fact that the rate of granulocyte decline in the monkey is the same after exposure to 600 r and 1000 r (Figure 14). (14) Under such circum\u00ad stances, the similar initial blood depopulation rate would suggest a similar normal disappearance in these species. As may be noted in Figure 14, the early blood granulocyte disappearance appears to be exponential with a half-time of 10 to 15 hr. Independent studies in normal dog, monkey and man(3-5) point to a random disappearance of granulocytes from circulation with a half-time of 5 to 10 hr. A similar pattern was described earlier in cross -circulation studies of normal and irradiated cats. ( 15) We wish to suggest that the duration of the latent period before the onset of definite granulocytopenia is a reflection of the size of the nonmi\u00ad totic differentiating pool in the several species. Although there is some evidence for this, the possibility of a quantitative relationship between marrow pool size and the sequence of events in blood in the various species requires further study. Other factors might, of course, be contributory; for example, differences in degree of early marrow bleeding could influence cell release. It is obviously desirable to include other species in the anal\u00ad ysis, but we have been unable thus far to find such data on the early granu\u00ad locytopenia after comparable radiation exposure. We have been concerned here only with the rate of development of granulocytopenia as a measure of initial injury. The subsequent pattern, namely the time to reach minimal levels and the time for recovery to pre\u00ad irradiation values, may differ considerably in the various species.(ll ) Even with large doses of radiation there will be some production of cells, albeit at a low level, when mitosis is resumed. Moreover, as granulocyto\u00ad penia becomes profound, the time spent by the newly-formed segmented cells in marrow may decrease, (2) and this will tend to prolong the time to reach a minimal blood level. However, the opposite situation may also result; for example, as infectious processes develop, granulocyte removal from circulation may be accelerated. For reasons of this sort, the clear\u00ad est relationship between the initial injury and the blood level in the various species is given by the early granulocyte decay after dosages sufficient to block production, such that the influence of possible differences in marrow pool size will be minimized. Granulocyte recovery is more rapid in mouse, rat and rabbit than in monkey and dog after comparable exposure. The reasons for this are not known but should become evident with further under\u00ad standing of the comparative dynamics of granulocyte renewal. The blood granulocyte mass differs in these species and if the normal blood turnover is the same as suggested in the present analysis, the effective or net pro\u00ad duction rates will vary accordingly. It is of interest to note that the net production estimated in this way increases by a factor of three from rat to rabbit, monkey and dog. This, as well as the size of the stem cell com\u00ad partment relative to production requirements and the degree of normally occurring ineffective granulopoiesis, could provide a basis for some of the differences in recovery among species. 57 58 The granulocyte response described here may be contrasted with the prompt lymphopenia of irradiation. While the former is a consequence of the disturbed granulopoiesis, the latter is brought about to a consider\u00ad able extent by direct killing of small lymphocytes in blood, lymph and lymphoid tissues.( l6-18) However, with exception of species differences in the latent period, the primary granulocytopenia appears to be species independent, which is also the case for the prompt lymphopenia. The foregoing is not necessarily inconsistent with the suggested exponential relationship between the basal metabolic rate of the various species and the time at which all leucocytes as a group attain minimal levels after an LD50130 exposure to X-rays. (19) Minimal leucocyte levels (which are dif\u00ad ficult to establish with precision) are reached earlier in species with higher rates of metabolism. However, the rabbit, which was not included in the analysis, would represent a serious departure from the proposed linearity.( l9) Although acute lethality is intimately associated with leuco\u00ad cyte depression, this pertains mainly to the granulocytes, and it will be recalled that the granulocyte-lymphocyte ratio differs considerably in the various species. Since other physiologic derangements also contribute to acute lethal action, it would seem more appropriate to examine possible species differences in injury and recovery after a similar dosage of radia\u00ad tion rather than after a similar degree of lethality. Summary Comparison of the early granulocytopenia in several mammalian species after comparable irradiation reveals a similar rate of decline, which approximates the normal rate of disappearance from circulation. The time between irradiation and onset of granulocytopenia varies and may perhaps be related to species differences in the nonmitotic differen\u00ad tiating marrow pool. References 1. Patt, H.

Maloney, Harvey M. Patt and Charlotte L. Weber While radiation effects are generally similar in mammals, import\u00ad ant differences are known which can be related to specific biological properties. There is a strong species component in blood neutrophil changes after irradiation. This might be related to differences in kinetics of neutrophil balance. In earlier work with dogs, (l,2) we determined that the decline in blood neutrophils after whole-body X-irradiation with 500 r was consistent with their normal rate of disappearance and occurred upon exhaustion of cells in the nonmitotic differentiating marrow pool. Initial studies with monkeys, also based on autoradiographic analyses with tri\u00ad tiated thymidine (H3T), indicate a similar picture.* There seems to be no difference between monkey and dog in the initial labeling of proliferating cells after H3T injection. Although the subsequent sequence in the monkey has not been studied at closely-spaced intervals, as in the dog, the chronology of development is approximately the same. Thus about 10 percent of labeled metamyelocytes are evident in monkey marrow by 12 hours after H3T administration (200 JJ.c/kg body weight; specific activity 360 me/millimole); labeled band cells are seen after the first day and segmented cells after the second day. The blood pattern is shown in Figure 15, where it will be seen that labeled neutrophils I 00 r:---.---..,.---r---r------.-----r---. \"' ...J X Q. :;) \"' ...J \"' CD ...J ... z \"' u 50 10 5 ffi 0.5 \".Monkey 0.1 :----:--4--...L_--.....l-----l.. _ __L _ _j 0 4 6 8 10 12 14 DAY$ AFTER H3-THYMIDINE Figure 15.

We believe that this may be due to the larger reservoir of mature neutrophils in monkey mar\u00ad row. With this exception, the curves describing the percentage of labeled cells in blood of monkey and dog are quite similar. Whole body X-radiation (1000 r) was given to two monkeys 24 hours after H3T injection. Auto\u00ad radiographic analysis of aspirated marrow samples indicates that dif\u00ad ferentiation and release of cells from marrow to blood proceeded in a nor\u00ad mal fashion. This is apparent from the blood pattern shown in Figure 16, where we may note also the similarity in disappearance of labeled cells and Part of this study was carried out at the United States Public Health Service Wisconsin Primate Center. 61 62 - in devel opment of radiation -induc ed neutropenia.

EFFECT OF AGE AND RADIATION ON THE LENS OF THE EYE IN THE MOUSE Robert L. Straube To increase our understanding of the physiological process of aging and the chronic somatic effects of ionizing radiation, we have characterized several physiological parameters in the CF No. 1 female mouse as a func\u00ad tion of age and radiation injury. One such cellular system studied was the lens of the eye. In most mammals the lens grows continually throughout life, new lenticular fibrils being added by the mitotic activity of relatively undif\u00ad ferentiated cells of the equator. The lens is encased in an avascular capsule that prevents exchange, at the cellular level, with the rest of the body. The lenticular fibrils that form the outer layers of the cortex are the most recent; those in the nucleus were laid down early in life and gradually become more dense, eventually being compressed into a hyaline mass in which individual fibers can scarcely be recognized. We found that 10 9 -a 0 E 7 - !i: 6 .., -5 .., J:. 2 0 Figure 17. 20 30 0 50 60 70 80 90 100 WEEKS OF AGE The effect of age on the weight of the dried lens of the eye in CF No. 1 female mice. Mean i S.E. the dried lens weight varies with the age of the mouse {Figure 17), confirming the findings in other species. (l,2) The lens weight in\u00ad creases from less than l mg at birth to about 10 mg at 100 weeks of age, the increase being most rapid during the first 40 weeks and somewhat slower thereafter. Variation is minimal, and an accurate estimation of age to \u00b12 weeks can be made in the early period. Radiation affects the lens by inhibiting lenticular mi\u00ad tosis. Degeneration and cell death may occur in this early phase. The mechanism of radiation cataract formation is not completely known, but the formation of abnormal, swollen lens fibers, which become opaque as they differentiate and are slowly pushed toward the posterior pole, is believed to play a role in the development of the eventual opacity. Since radiation \"ages\" the lens by decreasing the induction period for and in\u00ad creasing the incidence of cataracts, one might assume a priori that irradi\u00ad ation would also have an effect upon the normal physiological increase in lens weight, but no such effect was apparent. This is true for both the chronic and acute lens weight response. Mice irradiated (whole-body ) with 500 r at the age of 2 months and sacrificed at the age of 41 weeks showed no deviation from the normal (8.2.9 \u00b1 0.11 mg for the 2.0 irradiated animal :;;, versus 8.34 + 0.14 mg for the unirradiated controls). Twenty-three of these 63 64 irradiated mice survived for 52 weeks after irradiation; 13% of the exposed lensc s developed cataracts. In addition, 13 -week-old mice subjected to 800 r whole-body x-irradiation 10 days before sacrifice showed no radia\u00ad tion effect on lens weight {4.93 + 0.06 mg for irradiated mice versus 4.98 + 0.09 mg for controls). Animals irradiated at 2 months of age with 400 r and sacrificed at monthly intervals thereafter, although still in the active growth phase, showed no significant deviation from the pattern in the unirradiated animals (Table 20).

MONTE CARLO CALCULATIONS FOR THE STOCHASTIC THEORY OF MORTALITY George A. Sacher and Ernesto Trucco - 0 0 0 0 - The basic ideas underlying the stochastic theory of mortality are set forth in a prev10us report( 1) and we shall not repeat them here; fur\u00ad ther details have also been reported. (2) The current model system we are studying consists of a cubic potential (giving a quadratic force or \"restora\u00ad tion function\" ) from which particles escape under the influence of Brownian motion. In all but the simplest cases the probability of escape cannot be calculated explicitly and must be found by means of machine computation. Hence, a Monte Carlo program was set up, and some preliminary results of these studies have been presented (Reference (1), Figures 23 and 24). Further curves of a similar nature were obtained subsequently. However, one essential difficulty still remains; the method ts inadequate for the case of very small escape probabilities. Even the procedure of \"forcing escapes,\" (1) was not sufftcient to improve this undesirable state of affairs. (The reg10n of low escape rates is of special interest for a more complete formulation of the theory, and only in very few instances can it be treated analytically by means of the Chandrasekhar-Kramers equations. ) For these reasons, and also because the Monte Carlo program was unsatisfactory in some other respects, a new and different approach to the problem is now being studied by Dr. David A. Woodward of the Applied Mathematics Division. Very briefly, it can be summarized as follows. The desired quantlty (e g , expected percentage of escapes in a given situation ) is written as a Wiener integral, i e., the integral of a certain functional in the space whose elements are all possible traJectories of particles in free Brownian motlon. The problem then consists in finding the value of this integral, say I To that end, it is replaced by a related integral, I', accord\u00ad ing to a method known as \"Simpson's rule for Wiener tntegrals.\" (3) I' can now be evaluated by performing a sequence of Monte Carlo trials. The actual runs are carried out with a simplified force function from which all linear terms have been elimtnated It is expected that an estimation for I' better than the one prev10usly obtamed will result from these techniques. Since, however, the new program has not yet been written, further details will be given in subsequent reports. Meanwhtle the work of Dr. Woodward is gratefully acknowledged. 65 66 References l.

Sanderson Acute mortality (death within 30 days after exposure) is a conven\u00ad ient indicator by which the extent of radiation injury is commonly meas\u00ad ured. Yet, different mechanisms of lethal injury are expressed within this time period, indicated by different symptoms or time of death. For the most part, modes of acute death in the mouse and the bird appear to be comparable. A notable exception is an early mortality, associated with circulatory failure, that has been described in some birds. This mortality occurs within the first 2 days after irradiation in the chick and duck, (l) but not in the parakeet, (2,3) pigeon (4,5) or canary. (6) Available evidence, however, suggests that injury processes that terminate as early mortality in the chick and duck are also active in other birds and in mammals as well, although they do not produce lethal consequences. Such effects as intra- and extracellular swelling and capillary dilatation have been de\u00ad scribed. For a general description of the kinetics of acute radiation lethality , it is of interest to compare the dose -exposure-time relations for later acute mortality (3-30 days) in the mouse and in birds that do and do not exhibit 0-2 day deaths. .. ., 0 \" 20 \" 10 -0 0 - - 0 ;; 10 0 ' ' 10 20 x Chi ek Mouse o Porokeet a Pi9eon TIME AFTER EXPOSURE, days ' - 30 Figure 18. Daily distribution or deaths within 30 days after co60 y-irradiarion ror doses over the 30-day lethal range (all treatment groups combined). All exposures are to Co60 -y -rays, protracted over single continuous peri\u00ad ods ranging from 5 min to 1440 min (24 hours ). Details of the response for doses in the 30-day lethal range only ( 1-99% mortality) receive major em\u00ad phasis in this analysis. Comparison of the daily fre\u00ad quency of mortality for the 3 avian forms (chick, parakeet, pigeon) and for the mouse (Figure 18) shows a striking similarity. In the chick, in which there is an early mortality, a second peak occurs between days 6 and 8. In the pigeon, parakeet and mouse, on the other hand, there is no comparable early mortality, and the major portion of the fatalities occurs between about 6 and 15 days, with peak frequency between 10 and 13 days. In birds in 67 68 which an early mortality does not occur, hematopoietic fail ure appears to be the dominant lesion with exposures over the 30-day lethal range. There is bone marrow and lymphoid aplasia, and reduction of mortality by bone marrow transplants has been reported. (7) Thus the situation is comparable to that found in the mouse. In the chick, a mode of death expressed within 5-6 days has been described. (8) In the mortality frequency shown here, it overlaps the 7-to 30-day response; it is distinguishable, however, with exposures over a higher dose range. In other birds, the dose-exposure time relations for the earlier modes of death are such that there is less overlapping with hematopoietic death. Over the dose range with which we are concerned here hematopoietic death predominates; therefore, in the chick only the 7-to 30-day response is included in the analysis. Description of the time-dose relation for acute mortality in the chick,{ 8,9) the chick embryo, (lO,ll) and the parakeet and pigeon( 3) have been previously reported; details for the mouse are described in the accompanying report.

Relation of LD50 to exposure time for 3 avian species and the mouse. tions for LD50 values for the 4 spe\u00ad cies may be made from Figure 19. With increase in exposure time through 400-500 min there is a de\u00ad crease in effectiveness of the de\u00ad livered dose. With exposure periods of 9 60 and 1440 min, however, there is little further reduction,and a sta\u00ad tionary dose- response relation is attained. The quantitative descrip- tion of the kinetics of injury ac cu- mulation is based on two assumptions . First, the decrease in effectiveness of the delivered dose with increase in exposure time reflects the lethal action of time-dependent or revers\u00ad ible injury mechanisms, while in\u00ad variance of the dose-response relation with increase in exposure time indicates the action of time\u00ad independent or irreversible processes. Second, the dominant injury proc\u00ad esses expressed in the acute period are mutually independent. These assumptions are explicitly stated in earlier reports and in the discussion on the mouse. On the basis of this model, the stable dose-response relation ap\u00ad proximated by the longest exposure groups represents the time-independent effect. The LD50 values and estimates of a for this effect are given in Table 21. The increased effectiveness of the delivered dose with shorter exposure periods represents the action of time-dependent processes. Sta\u00ad tistical partition of the mortality due to each of the two processes is ac\u00ad complished according to the following expression Rd,t = Pd,t where Rd,t is the total proportion dying from a dose d delivered in time t, P d t is the proportion dying of time-dependent effects, and Qd is the pro- ' portion that succumbs to time-independent effects. The instantaneous dose- mortality distribution, estimated from the shortest exposure time groups, reflects the sensitivity of the species to the time- dependent effects lethally expressed in this period. The LD50 values and estimates of a for this effect are also given in Table 21.

A linear relationship for all species is evident (Fig- ure 20); for the 3 avian forms the slopes are not significantly different, but for the mouse the slope is less, indicating a less rapid rate of reversal. The reciprocal of the slope is an estimate of the time constant (T) of the linear reversal process. The relationship shown in Figure 20 is represented by the expression D Do -1 + ! T 70 where t is exposure time. For the birds T is equal to about 300 min, while for the mouse it is equal to 154 7 min. On the basis of the constant (linear) reversal, the reversal rates are independent of accumulated dose. The reversal rate is normally distributed and has been postulated to be an in- 1.8 1.7 1.6 1.5 0 1.4 0 ...... 0 1.3 1.2 ' I .I I 0 1.0 X 0.9 Figure 20.

In the 3 species of birds, the revers\u00ad al rate per unit of injury is equiva\u00ad lent, but in terms of roentgens the reversal rates vary depending on dose sensitivity. Thus the mean rates are: chick -3. 7 r /min; para\u00ad keet -5.0 r/min; and pigeon - 6.8 r/min. In the chick and the mouse, linearly reversible processes have also been recognized for modes of acute death preceding that due to hematopoietic failure. In the chick, lethal mechanisms expressed within 3-6 days show a time- independent effect and a time -dependent effect with kinetics similar to that described for the later acute mortality. The estimate of the time constant for the reversible effect is 290 min and the reversal rate is about 4 r/min. In the mouse, the 3-6 day \"intestinal syndrome 11 also shows time -dependent and time -independent components, but the rever sal rate associated with time -dependent effects is more rapid than that described for the later acute lethality. The value forT is approx\u00ad imately equal to 725 min, compared to 154 7 min for the later mortality, and the mean reversal rate is about 2 r/min. The model, as proposed, ascribes the lack of a time effect for the longer exposures to an irreversible process that is independently expressed. Alternatively, a single time-dependent mechanism that either reverses for a limited time only, or reverses a limited amount of dose only, could be postulated as descriptive of lethal effects expressed within this mortality period. From results of different types of protracted exposures, we know that the reversal cannot be limited solely by a time period (e.g., about 500 min for the bird or 1000 min for the mouse). For example, the static dose-response relation for 480-to 1440-min exposures in the chick indi\u00ad cates that reversal may continue for longer periods. Nevertheless, from available data we cannot exclude the possibility that the reversal is limited both by total dose and by reversal rate; that is, reversal occurs either at a rate that is a characteristic constant of the individual animal or at the . \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7-- .. \u00b7- rate of delivery (whichever is less) but there is a limitation on the total dose that can be reversed. On the basis of this model, the D/Do ratios with respect to exposure time for the unpartitioned mortality take the form shown in Figure 21.

However, the time constant associated with this amount of re\u00ad duction in dose effectiveness is about twice as large in the mouse as in the birds. In the 3 species of birds, the reversal rate per unit of injury is again equivalent, although the actual rate in roentgens differs by a factor of 2. Further investigations with various types of split-dose exposures will be helpful in indicating which model is more probable. In neither case, however, is the type of kinet\u00ad ics descriptive of the reversal proc- esses altered by the nature of the limiting factor; that is, the attainment of the lethal bound for an independ\u00ad ent irreversible component, or some saturation effect.

Tyler and S. Phyllis Stearner To explain the reduction m effectiveness of ionizing radiatwns in producing an acute lethal damage to mammals, several models have been proposed. ( 1) Meredith (2) showed that the kinetics of acute radiation mor\u00ad tality in CF No. 1 mice for protracted exposures up to 6 hr could be viewed as an Instance of Schwartzschild's law. This law states that eqlnvalent ra\u00ad diation effects are sustained by irradiated groups for which the product of the dose rate and a constant power of the exposure time is numerically the same Kingery (3) and Lea(4) proposed a model based on the assumption that the rate at which the effective dose accumulates is equal to the rate at which dose is delivered minus a term consisting of a constant (with dimensions of reciprocal tlme) multlphed by the effective dose already ob\u00ad tained (the exponential reversal hypothesis). Blair (5) augmented this mod\u00ad el by assuming that the effective dose represents the direct sum of two injury accumulation processes: 1) a residual effect that accumulates ac\u00ad cordmg to the exponential reversal hypothes1s (also called the reversible portion of the effect) and 2) the direct effect of a portion of the delivered dose for which reversal is absent (also called the irreversible portion). Brown, et al (6) showed that the postulation that the rate of accumulat10n -- of the effective dose is lower than the rate of delivery by a constart amount (linear reversal hypothesis*) is tenable for exposure perwds up to 6 hr; male 'R 11 mice were subjected to 250 kv X-irradiation in the1r expenments Tyler and Stearner (8) proposed that acute irradiation initiates in the organ 1sm several lethal effects that accumulate independently and that individually can cause the death of an organism. Death occurs when any single effect passes the cntical level (or lethal bound) associated with that effect. As m Blair's model, both reversible and irreversible injury processes are postulated; but contrary to his assumptions, reversible effects are assumed subject to a hnear reversal during exposure and the delivered dose IS not partitwned between these two effects. We shall demonstrate that the last kinetic model of injury accumula\u00ad tion will describe the course of mortality observed for the 30-day lethal range after a single, protracted exposure of mice to Co60 'Y-rays *The linear reversal hypothesis was previously proposed as a descrip\u00ad tion of the kmetics of radiation injury that attains lethal proport10ns w1thin 2 days after an irradiation with Co60 'Y -rays in the young ch1ck. (?) 73 74 Experiment Male and female LAF1 mice were exposed at approximately 120 days of age to a single, continuous dose of Co60 -y-rays. The exposure period was varied from 10 to 1440 min. The delivered dose ranged from 850 to 4000 r, as measured in air. Under these radiation conditions, mor\u00ad tality ranges from a few percent within 30 days to 100 percent within 5 days. Animals were irradiated in groups of 3 in Lucite containers. Food and water were available at all times. Observations from both male and fe\u00ad male mice are combined since no pronounced sex differences were evident in time or pattern of acute deaths or pathology at death. The 30-day Lethal Range The range of doses within which the percentage of deaths occurring within 30 days after irradiation is greater than zero and less than 100 is referred to as the 30-day lethal range. It can be seen from Table 2.2 and Figure 22. that the lethal range is dependent on length of protraction. Also, O\\\u00b7er this range, very few deaths are observed before the ninth day. Thus, deaths occurring between 9 and 30 days constitute the mortality usually summarized in acute experiments. The plot of LD50 versus exposure time (Figure 23) clearly demonstrates the increase in dose required to produce death in 50 percent of the exposed animals as the protraction is lengthened. We shall ignore the 10-min exposure groups since the observed mortality in these groups is incompatible with the over-all trend established by groups of other exposures (Figure 22). The dependence of LD50 on exposure time (Figure 2.3) cannot be explained completely by either a linear or exponen\u00ad tial reversal model since both models require a continuing increase in LD50 as the exposure time is increased. Two general models that are con\u00ad sistent with the observed empirical pattern have been considered: 1. At least 2 types of injury processes are operative; one accounts for the loss of dose effectiveness with increase in exposure time and the other produces an irreversible injury (within the range tested); 2. The observed kinetics reflect a single underlying process that reduces the effectiveness of the radiation for a limited time only, or until some dose has been delivered. We have chosen to adopt the first of these general models to characterize the injury kinetics reflected by the observed dependence of 9-30 day mor\u00ad tality in the mouse on dose and exposure period (see Reference 9 for more detail).

We assume that these two processes are independent and that the lethality due to the time\u00ad dependent process is described without contamination by the dose\u00ad mortality curve of the combined 960- and 1440-min exposure groups (Figure 22). The contribution of this mortality is then removed from the total mortality observed in all groups* exposed less than 960 min. The corrected mortalities are exhibited with respect to ex\u00ad posure time and dose in Figure 24, and represent the mortality due solely to the time-independent proc\u00ad ess (reversible effects). For each group we determined the ratio be\u00ad tween the dose (D) received over some exposure time and the dose (D60) required, if delivered in 60 min, to produce the same group mortality. The mean ratio D/D60 for each exposure time was computed; the linearity of the relationship between these ratios and exposure time is shown in Figure 25. Using the least squares constants obtained for the relationship above, the linear function representing the D/D0 versus exposure time relation was approximated (Figure 25) and the instantaneous dose-mortality *Group refers to the collection of irradiated animals that receive the same dose at the same rate. 0 .. 0 ' 0 ....

The symbol D0 represents the dose that if given instantaneously, would produce the observed group mortality. Since a reduc\u00ad tion in reversible effects is assumed to take place during an exposure, the full effect of the dose will be registered only if delivery is instantaneous. Thus the mortality dis\u00ad tribution of instantaneous doses measures the tolerance of the organisms to the non\u00ad reversed effects. Using the estimated D0 line in Figure 24 and the linear model D = 1 +.!_ ' Do T the theoretical curves at exposures from oL---------L----L--_J 90 to 480 min in Figure 24 were constructed. The time constant T = 1547 min and the in\u00ad stantaneous dose distribution (LD50 = 985 r, 0 100 200 300 400 00 Figure 25. EXPOSURE TIME, min D . Average - 0 rauo versus 60 exposure time. .-.. a = 84 r) together represent all the infor- mation displayed in Figure 24 (except for the 10 min groups) and are the essential parameters associated with the reversible effect. Thus, acute mortality occurring between 9 and 30 days after ex\u00ad posure (the 30-day lethal range) can be explained by postulating two injury processes that independently contribute to the observed mortality - a lin\u00ad ear reversal process that is the dominant lethal process at short exposures and an irreversible process that governs the lethality with exposures of 79 80 V\u20aclry low rate. For the dose .. mortality curve that expresses the population sensitivity to the irreversible process, LD50 = 1381 rand o= 133 r (Figure 22). It is interesting to note that comparable experimental results with continuous, single exposures reported by other investigators can be com\u00ad pared using this method of standardization. In Figure 26, the computed D/Do ratios based on published data together with our results are plotted with respect to exposure time. Several strains of mice and different qual\u00ad ities of radiation are represented, but under the dose transformation used, the kinetics of injury accumulation are very similar. If we assume that the groups represented received the same average injury, then we could surmise that the time constants associated with all of these groups have roughly the same magnitude. Differences between strains of mice and qualities of radiation may simply alter proportionately the amount of radi\u00ad ation required for a unit of injury. 1.50 1.45 1.40 -1.3 - -0 1.30 0 - !! 1.2 c a 1.20 e - 0 . 1.15 - a \"' - 1.10 ..... 0 1.0 1.00 1.9 0 0 X 200 400 600 800 EXPOSURE ..

For the highest dose used in these experiments (400 r delivered in 1440 min), 100% mortality was achieved by the fifth postirradiation day. Two periods \u00b7of peak mortality can be discerned in the daily mortality patterns -3 to 6 days and 6 to 9 days. These periods correspond roughly to the postir\u00ad radiation time of appearance of the intestinal syndrome and of bacteremia, respectively. Different processes of injury accumulation are lethally ex\u00ad pressed within these periods. However, the kinetics of these processes can be shown to fall into one of the two types that characterize radiation effects of the 9-30 day period. References 1. Quastler, H.

Finkel and Birute 0. Biskis The major consequences of exposure of experimental animals to plutonium were known within the first few years after this new element became available for biological experimentation. (1 ,2) In order to compare plutonium toxicity with that of other radioelements under a set of standard conditions, we designed an experiment in 1951 with 900 mice. Although these studies have contributed to several communications published between 1953 and 1959, (3 -7) they have not been reported in detail. One reason is that the animals were plagued with an intestinal infection, which seriously reduced both the population and our interest in analyzing the data. Since it is not unusual for mouse colonies to carry endemic infections, it is im\u00ad portant that the situation be recognized when it does occur and that it be taken into account during the processing of the data. This experiment now has been examined with a view to differentiating between those pathological lesions induced by infectious and other diseases and those specifically caused by plutonium. Care has been taken to present the results in such a way that recognition of changes due to plutonium is least influenced by ex\u00ad traneous diseases. Materials and Methods The CF No. 1 female mice scheduled for the experiment arrived in the Laboratory when they were 5-6 weeks old. Many died during the next three weeks, their major symptom being diarrhea. The best-appearing animals were selected when they were 9-10 weeks old, the hope being that the disease had run its course and would cause little further difficulty. They were assigned 15 to a cage by a system of random numbers. One week later Pu239 citrate in acid, isotonic solution was injected into one of the lateral tail veins. The control mice were injected with a comparable solution without plutonium. The amounts administered in fJ.c/kg, based upon the 24 -g average body weight of the entire population before injection, are listed in Table 23 for each group. Experimental routine included daily observation of the animals and the selection of moribund individuals for sacrifice. We felt that the error introduced into the survival data by killing animals extremis was more than offset by getting fresh material for histologic study. In addition, this procedure made it possible to obtain a peripheral blood sample from a tail vein just before autopsy. Hemoglobin determinations and white blood cell and differential counts were made routinely.

Any other tissues that appeared abnormal were also preserved. After the viscera had been removed, an X-ray picture of the skeleton was taken. The tho\u00ad racic and lumbar vertebrae and a femur, as well as any other areas that appeared abnormal on the roentgenogram, were then taken for histologic study. Animals that died a natural death were inspected grossly, and their tissues were examined histologically if autolysis was not advanced. The amount and kind of material available for study is summarized in Table 24.

The values for some cage units within a given group were so different that they seemed not to belong to the same population. Analysis of variance indicated that the probability of seeing chance variations as great or greater than those ob\u00ad served within Groups 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, and 12 was less than 0.01. The prob\u00ad ability for Group 10 was between 0.01 and 0.05, and only for Groups 3 and 8 was it greater than 0.05. Obviously, something besides plutonium had had a profound effect upon survival, and comparison of dosage groups on the basis of average survival time alone has little meaning in this experi\u00ad ment. It should be noted that even in Groups 5, 6, and 7, which had received 3.1, 1.7, and 0.69 J..LC Pu/kg, respectively, the average survival time of one cage unit was the same as, or exceeded, the average of the control group. 100 0 L__ __ __;__ 12 II 10 9 e DOSAGE GROUP Figure 27 Average survival time. The broad horizontal bar and shaded area mark the mean and standard error of the mean for each dosage group. The diamonds represent the mean and standard error for each cage unit. The number of mice dying within successive 25 -day periods is plotted for each dosage group in Figure 28. When all the mice are con\u00ad sidered, there seems to be very little difference in the frequency distribu\u00ad tions among Groups 8 through 12. When only those animals that belong to cage units with relatively good survival are considered, Groups 6 and 7 also seem to fall in line with the control and lower dosage groups. One might be tempted at this point to eliminate from further study all members of those cages that displayed poor survival relative to others in the same group. Such a procedure, however, would remove many mice that lived as long as 11the average mouse, 11 or even longer.

X indicates animals killed accidentally or miss\u00ad ing. Black squares mark animals belonging to cage units with poor survival relative to others in the same dosage group. Life expectancy is plotted in Figure 2 9. This method of presenting survival data has an advantage over cumulative mortality because it emphasizes the living population rather than the dead. Such a change of emphasis is particularly useful when death from infection occurs early in an experiment. The data show a rather sharp distinction between dosage Groups 5 and 6, and it is clear that life expectancy was reduced by the administration of 3.1 fJ.C Pu/kg or more. Life expectancy of Groups 6 and 7 (1. 7 and 0.69 fJ.c/kg, respectively ) was very similar to that of the control group between 300 and 600 days; consequently the reduction observed before and after this period may not have been due to plutonium. Smaller amounts of plutonium (0.34-0.04 fJ.c/kg) did not decrease life expectancy . Terminal Hematology The hemoglobin values of the moribund animals are presented in Figure 30. The ad\u00ad ministration of 15.6 fJ.C Pu/kg or more markedly reduced the amount of hemoglobin; 6.1 J.LC/kg or less seemed to have no effect. The concentration of white blood cells is given in Figure 31. A large portion of the ob\u00ad served variation was due to values from animals with tumors of the reticular tissues, a disease that is frequently associated with an elevated white count. When cases of reticular tumors were excluded from the calculations, most mean cell counts were lower, and there was less var\u00ad iation. A change in leucocyte concentration oc\u00ad cur red between Groups 6 and 7, those mice that received 0.69 fJ.C/kg or less having an average count about the same as that of the control mice. Terminal Pathology It is not always possible, and often not appropriate, to designate a single specific rea\u00ad son for death. In fact, in this experiment the immediate cause of death usually was the intravenous administration of sodium pentobarbital. In spite of unavoidable errors, however, an attempt has been made to assign a primary cause of death to each mouse .

Other points of particular interest are: 1) liver disease was responsible for only 13 deaths, but it was present in 246 cases; 2) almost 50o/o of the mice had lung tumors; 3) the \"average mouse\" had 1.05 tumors. Since the main subject of this report is plutonium toxicity, not mouse pathology, only those conditions that might be important in assess\u00ad ing toxicity will be considered further. Intestinal infection. Salmonella infection, which had caused many deaths before the experiment began, continued to be a problem throughout the first year. Even after 500 days a few animals showed the gross and microscopic lesions typical of this disease. Other intestinal infections in\u00ad eluded seven cases of Pseudomonas and some that remained unidentified. 87 88 (/) ..J <I :::!: 10 5 10 5 10 5 5 u. 0 0: w \"' :::!: 5 :::> z -- 900 DAYS AFTER INJECTION Figure 32 Frequency disrribution of death with time after injection.

Except for a very high incidence soon after injection in Groups 4, 5, and 6 and the absence of early cases in Group 8, there was no pattern associated with dosage group. Amyloidosis. Amyloid disease was al\u00ad most as serious a factor in depleting the pop\u00ad ulation as was intestinal infection. Deposits occurred most frequently in the liver, kidney, spleen, and ovary. Amyloidosis was usually present in mice that had dermatitis. The Chi\u00ad square test (with Yates' correction) gives a value of 96.1 which is a probability of much less than 0.001 that there is no association be\u00ad tween these two conditions. Chronic skin in\u00ad fection seemed to be due in large part to an infestation with mites. Mites are no longer a problem in our mouse colony, and in recent experiments amyloidosis has been very rare. The frequency distribution in Figure 33 shows that the disease was not influenced by plu\u00ad tonium administration. Liver pathology. Both fatty and parenchymatous degeneration of the liver oc\u00ad curred. However, it is very difficult to evalu\u00ad ate these changes in terms of plutonium toxicity because both Salmonella and Pseudom\u00ad onas infections often were associated with liver lesions, and amyloid deposits were com\u00ad mon. The frequency distribution of death with fatty or parenchymatous degeneration of the liver is plotted in Figure 34. Although no cases of fatty degeneration were seen among the control mice, it has been seen in the con\u00ad trols of other experiments. There is a sug\u00ad gestion that cases appeared sooner among animals that received 0. 69 f.J.C Pu/kg or more. Inclusion bodies were found within the nuclei of some hepatic cells in a few animals (Figure 35). They seemed to occur most frequently in mice belonging to the higher dosage groups. In general, both the number of cells involved and the number of inclusions per nucleus were greater after larger amounts of plutonium had been given. In this experiment - nuclear inclusions were not seen in any livers of control mice, but they have been seen occasionally in other old control animals. The proportion of livers studied histologically that showed nuclear inclusions, fatty de genera\u00ad tion, or parenchymatous degeneration is given in Table 26.

Hepatoma incidence, which is given in Table 2 7, seems not to be associated with the amount of plutonium that had been administered. Mammary tumors. There were 101 mammary adenocarcinomas and five mammary adenoacanthomas within the total population. Since most of the dec.ths with mammary tumors occurred more than 300 days after the start of the experiment, the proportion of mice with tumors tended to be greater among those dosage groups that lived longer (Table 2 7). Lung tumors. Lung tumors appeared as early as 50 days after in\u00ad jection, and the incidence of these tumors continued to increase with age (Figure 36). As a consequence, the lower dosage groups had larger pro\u00ad portions of mice with lung tumors than the higher dosage groups (Table 2 7). Seventy-nine percent of the neoplasms that were examined histologically were adenocarcinomas; the rest were adenomas. Tumors of the reticular tis sues. The proportion of animals that died with any one of the tumors of the blood-forming tissues is given in Table 28. The increase in incidence with decrease in amount of plutonium over part of the dosage range was due to the fact that all but the lympho\u00ad cytic tumors occur primarily in middle or advanced age. The time factor is included in Figure 3 7, where there is no evidence that plutonium changed the normal incidence of reticular tissue tumors. Osteogenic sarcomas. Sixty-six of the 886 mice had malignant tumors of bone when they died. Most of these belonged to dosage Groups 3 through 8, but there were three in Group 9 and two in the control group (Figure 38). The earliest death with a bone tumor took place 223 days after injection and the last 671 days after. 91 92 1/) _, .. CD ::1! :> z These 66 mice had 138 malignant bone tumors, all of which were osteogenic sarcomas. Most of the cases of multiple neoplasms appeared in dosage Groups 4, 5, and 6, and within these groups the tumors seemed to be distributed at random among the animals. Consequently, calculation of incidence on the basis of number of tumors rather than number of ani\u00ad mals with tumors is preferable. The results of both calculations are given in Table 29, as well as alternative calculations based on total initial popu\u00ad lation or population alive at 200 days. The latter is a better measure of the carcinogenic response since it eliminates those mice that died early of intestinal infection and other extraneous diseases. 10 (I) 10 5 (2) 15taw61 (3) 10 1 5-< (4) 10 5 (5) r . 5 (6) , . -10 i \u00a7 5iML..w .--(7) 5 5 5 5 15 10 5 (8) (12) 900 DAYS AFTER INJECTION Figure 36 1/) _, .. ::::> z 10 (I) 10 5 (2) 15taml (3) 10 5 10 5 5 10 i 5 5 5 15 10 5 (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (10) q DAYS AFTER INJECTION Figure 37 10 (I ) 10 5 (2) - 15 (3) 10 5 ff1i.il (4) 10 5 ( 5) 1/) 10 lm ( 12) n 0 300 600 900 DAYS AFTER INJECTION Figure 38 Frequency dismbution of death with time after injection.

A reasonably good substitute is tumor expectancy, which is determined by dividing the number of osteogenic sarcomas still to appear by the number of animals still alive. This was done at l 0 -day intervals, and the average value from 200 days until the time when less than three mice remained ahve is given in Table 29. According to this calculation, 2% of the control mice would be expected to die with osteogenic sarcomas, and the incidence would be three times greater if 0.16 JJ.C Pu/kg were administered. Seventy percent of the malignant bone tumors were located in the spine, l7o/o in the long bones, 9% in the girdles and ribs, and 4o/o in the head (Table 30).

Without adequate ex\u00ad amination, for example, these survival data could be interpreted as dem\u00ad onstrating that 0.34 J.Lc Pu/kg did not reduce life span but that 0.69 J.Lc/kg reduced it by 43%. A case could even be made for 0.08 J.Lc/kg increasing average survival time. In fact, on more than one occasion these and similar data have been the basis for the statement that a small amount of radiation prolongs life. (8) Because of the association between cage unit and infectious disease, it is often proposed that mice belonging to different dosage groups be caged together. The chief arguments against such a procedure are: 1) animals potentially debilitated by the experimental treatment are placed 95 96 in competition with less debilitated or normal mice, and 2) it introduces the possibility of error in identification. The ideal solution, of course, is individual caging. Those characteristics that were influenced by the administration of plutonium are summarized in Table 32. The survival data for 1. 7 and 0.69 fJ.c/kg were equivocal, and for 0.34 fJ.C/kg or less they were not dif\u00ad ferent from the control data. This lack of evidence of life shortening, how\u00ad ever, might be due to the limited number of animals and to the complications imposed by the extraneous diseases.

Serial sampling during the first few months of the experi\u00ad ment might have shown changes in hemoglobin values and number of leukocytes at lower dosages than those indicated in Table 32. Since a large portion of the plutonium retained after intravenous injection is present in the liver, changes occur within the liver,(2,9,10) and it was most unfortunate that amyloid disease and the intestinal in\u00ad fections complicated the picture. Placing the dividing line for effective and noneffective dosages for fatty and parenchymatous degeneration be\u00ad tween 0.69 and 0.34 fJ.C/kg is quite arbitrary. In previous experiments the presence of inclusion bodies within hepatic cell nuclei had been considered to be more diagnostic of plutonium poisoning than was hepatic degeneration, but in this experiment the condi\u00ad tion was not frequent, and never severe. Perhaps a larger amount of plutonium in longer -lived mice is required for maximum response. Nuclear inclusions cannot be a specific reaction to plutonium deposition because they have been found occasionally in old, untreated mice. However, the num\u00ad ber of cells involved and the number of inclusions per cell never have been as great as in mice that received plutonium. Also in previous experiments bile duct proliferation had been seen in response to plutonium deposition in the liver. This change occurred in only one animal in this experiment, one which had received 15.6 f.Lc/kg. There was no other indication that plutonium localized in the liver might be carcinogenic. One would not expect tumors of any other soft tissues to be influenced by the intravenous administration of plutonium, except, perhaps, tumors of the blood-forming organs. Even these seemed to be unaffected, however, leaving only osteogenic sarcomas to prove that plutonium is carcinogenic. The largest number of malignant bone tumors was induced by 6.1 f.LC Pu/kg; the next higher dosage produced fewer tumors, perhaps be\u00ad cause non-neoplastic damage was so extensive. No osteogenic sarcomas appeared among the mice that had received 0.08 and 0.04 f.LC/kg even though 195 mice were alive in these two groups 200 days after injection. On the basis of the control value of 0.02, four tumors would have been expected among these 195 mice. It is probable that the tumor expectancy of 0.06 after the administration of 0.16 f.Lc/kg represents a real increase over the control value. None of the tumor ratios nor the tumor expectancy values given in Table 29 falls along a straight line when they are plotted against injected ,_ <> z .. 0 1.0 \"' AMOUNT INJECTED I I'C/9) Figure 39 Logarithm of tumor expectancy plotted against logarithm of amount of pluton\u00ad i urn injected. amounts of plutonium. Consequently, they are not very useful for predicting minimum carcinogenic amounts. A semilog plot is no better, but a log -log straight line repre\u00ad sents the tumor expectancy values quite well (Figure 39). The extensive histopathologic changes seen in the skeleton will be the subject of a separate report. It would be appropriate at this point to state the magnitude and the duration of the dose responsible for the malignant bone tumors. We expect this to be possible some day. At present we can only say that dosimetry in relation to carcinogensis in 97 98 the mouse skeleton is a fascinating and difficult study, and we are not neg\u00ad lecting it. An important clue probably lies in the location of the tumors. The great preponderance of neoplasms in the spine shows that plutonium in trabecular bone is more likely to induce tumors than plutonium in cor\u00ad tical bone. The situation was somewhat the same when Ra226 was the carcinogenic agent, but reversed when it was Sr90. (ll) The critical factor may be the volume of responsive tissue that receives an adequate dose. Correlations between the data and retained amounts of pluton1um or absorbed dose have not been attempted for several reasons. In the fast place, retention studies were not done on animals that were completely comparable to the long-term toxicity animals. In the second place, we would not know over what period of time to integrate an absorbed dose re\u00ad sponsible for any given change. In the third place, only values for average absorbed dose could be estimated, and there is no reason to believe that the average has any meaning when the dose is distributed as non-uniformly in space and in time as is the dose from intravenously injected plutonium. The best evidence against the validity of averaging the dose is the fact that the expectancy of having an osteogenic sarcoma at death does not increase linearly with the amount injected but comes close to increasing as a power of the amount injected. Summary CF No. l mice were given a single intravenous injection of pluton\u00ad ium citrate in amounts ranging from 0.04 to 40.6 J.Lc/kg, after which they were permitted to live until moribund. Several extraneous diseases com\u00ad plicated the survival data, but life expectancy clearly was reduced by 3.1 J.Lc/kg or more. Terminal hemoglobin values were lower than normal when 15.6 J.Lc/kg or more had been iven, and the concentration of white blood cells was de\u00ad creased by l. 7 J.Lcfkg or more. Degenerative changes in the liver occurred more frequently than normal among mice that had received at least 0.69 J.Lc/kg, and inclusion bodies within the nuclei of hepatic cells were occasionally found among those that had received 3.1J.Lc/kg or more. The incidence of liver neoplasms was not increased. The number of osteogenic sarcomas surpassed the number among the control mice when the injected amount of plutonium was 0.16 J.Lc/kg or more. There were no tumors among the mice that had received 0.04 or 0.08 11c/kg. Seventy percent of the malignant bone tumors were located in the spine. We are indebted to Gertrude Hirsch Schribner for her contributions during the course of the experiment, to a large number of technicians and animal caretakers whose efforts made the experiment possible, and to Merlin Dipert and Carol Vancina for their assistance with electronic data process1ng.

SEMIANNUAL REPORT FOR PERIOD ENDING MAY 31, 1962 William P. Norris, Louise S. Lombard, Carl E. Rehfeld, Thomas W. Speckman and Herman M. Slatis This is the third semiannual report of studies on the metabolism and toxicity of fission products in purebred beagle dogs. The primary object is to study the effects of injected Ce144 and Cs137 The first experi\u00ad ment to determine whether the acutely lethal dose (LD50130) of Cs137 is age-dependent has already been performed Personnel In addition to 4 staff members there are 1 technical assistant, 4 technicians and 1 records secretary. There is also 1 part-time labora\u00ad tory assistant. Two animal caretakers, including a caretaker group leader, have been added, bringing the total to 5. This is now an adequate crew to handle the present number of dogs. Dr. Herman Slatis is participating in the genetic aspects of the breeding program. Drs. Henry M. Rosenberg and Thomas Emmering, University of Illinois, School of Dentistry, are studying tooth development and dental disease in the dog colony. Phys1cal Plant Installation of laboratory furniture, sinks, piped utilities and electric outlets in the laboratory space associated w.th the kennels was completed in April, 1962. The Dog Colony and the Genetic Program for Production of a Umform Strain of Beagles Animals for these studies have thus far been almost entirely out\u00ad bred. However, a senous attempt 1s also being made to produce inbred strains. In this program dealmg w1th the tox1c1ty and metabolism of radio\u00ad nuclides, it could be argued that there is an intention of extrapolating the results to man, a nonuniform an1mal However, the data of these experi\u00ad ments will often be observations of quaht1es such as changes in physio\u00ad logical parameters or tumor frequencies. It is obvwus from statistical considerations that changes of these types will more easily be detectable against a uniform background than against a variable one. The numbers of animals needed to show the various observable effects will be fewer if the strain used has a narrow range of responses. The goal of uniformity can be reached only through a process of selection for genetic homogeneity. An additional advantage is that once a uniform strain has been developed, there will not be much change with the passage of time. In most organisms it is a rule that inbred animals are less hardy than outbred animals and that hybrids between two inbred strains are the best. Although this rule holds for mice, it has not been tested on large mammals. The inbreeding program began with several distinct strains so that it would be possible to switch to a hybrid of two inbred lines if this appears to be best. The inbreeding program was begun with four lines of beagles that were already partially inbred. Of these lines, one was purchased because of its history of successful inbreeding and three lines were derived from separate instances of single generations of inbreeding that had taken place within the Argonne beagle colony. Two of these Argonne strains are not proving successful, but the third Argonne strain and the purchased strain have both produced two further inbred generations within two years. These last generations have inbreeding coefficients of about 0.55* in each of the strains. One of these lines now contains a large number of dogs all similar in appearance, so that by stopping further inbreeding and using closed -family, selective breeding it could shortly supply our needs. There has been only one observation of a congential anomaly among the 59 inbred puppies born in this program, although all dead puppies were necropsied. In addition, there is no evidence of a reduced litter size or decreased fertility among the inbred animals in the two major lines. The complete record shows that a total of 307 pups have been whelped in the entire breeding program. In the outbred group about 30% of the pups failed to survive to weaning, whereas about 40% of the pups from each of the two prospering inbred lines failed to survive the same period. Some of this difference may be associated with the fact that the inbred bitches have generally been bred at relatively younger (i.e. 16 months or less) ages. Mean litter size was nearly identical in inbred and outbred groups, about 4.5. *This is on a scale that runs from zero for an outbred animal to 1. 00 for an animal with an almost infinite number of highly inbred crosses in its ancestry. Among future crosses, further inbreeding of full sibs will increase the inbreeding coefficient each generation by about one -fifth of the difference between 1. 00 and the value of the coefficient in that generation. 101 102 Among 118 necropsies performed on the stock, breeding and special nonradioactive experimental animals, the following subdivisions have been made: 36 stillborn deaths; 52 newborn deaths {deaths occurring within the first 7 days of life); 20 infectious diseases; and 10 noninfectious dis\u00ad eases {tumors, trauma). Over one-third of the newborn deaths may be attributed to nonin\u00ad fectious causes, such as failure of the bitch to take care of her offspring, trauma inflicted by bitch and exposure to extreme variations in tempera\u00ad ture. Most of the remaining {newborn deaths) were associated with in\u00ad fectious disease processes, such as pneumonia, bacteremia and enteritis; congential anomalies and intussusception were rare. The 20 adult dogs dying of infectious disease were almost entirely limited to the epidemic in the summer of 1960, when an outbreak of distemper and hepatitis oc\u00ad curred, The noninfectious deaths in adult dogs may be divided into the following categories: 4 tumors; 6 trauma. The Epidemiology and Incidence of Periodontal Disease in Beagle Hounds* It has been observed previously that beagle hounds maintained in a controlled environment exhibited diseases of the periodontium. From these observations it appeared that the periodontium is subject to abnormal changes at an early age (approximately 9 months) and that the progression of these changes in the periodontium is correlated with aging. Advanced changes in the periodontium result in severe inflammation with eventual loss of gingivae and supporting structures accompanied by loosening and occasional exfoliation of teeth. Similar observations have been made in the beagle colony at Ar\u00ad gonne National Laboratory. Specific Aims The proposed research project, which utilizes a colony of pure\u00ad bred beagle hounds in a controlled environment has the following aims: 1) to observe the growth and development of dento-alveolar tissues in beagle hounds (maintained in a controlled environment) in order to assess the morphologic characteristics of the periodontium, 2) to determine the incidence of gingival and periodontal disease based upon objective evidence, 3) to correlate presence or absence of calculus with alterations of the periodontium, and finally, 4) to establish a longitudinal assessment of the morphophysiology of the periodontium. *Dr. Henry M. Rosenberg and Dr. Thomas Emmering, School of Dentistry, University of Illinois. Methods Six female and 6 male beagles which could be classified as repre\u00ad sentative animals of their age groups were selected. Of the 6 females (Group I) 2 were born September 30, 1960, 3 on October l, 1960, and 1 on October 12, 1960. Of the 6 males (Groups II) 1 was born April 18, 1961, 3 on April 23, 1961, and 2 on April 24, 1961. Observations include 1) clinical examination of oral cavity, chart\u00ad ing specifically for evaluation of tooth cleanliness and calculus, and gingival tissue; (normal or inflamed) 2) evaluation of lateral cephalometric radiographs of each jaw to provide radiographs for serial study; and 3) special procedures including intra-oral photographs (Kodachrome) to record observations objectively, and surface texture buccal impressions and comparison photographs. In addition, representative tissue samples will be taken for histologic study. General Observations l. Initial Clinical Assessment of Oral Health Status Tooth cleanlmess. At 9 months of age, definite calculus was observed on upper 4th maxillary premolar at the level of the cementa\u00ad enamel junction; it had not progressed to mid-crown. The amount of calculus was less on maxillary 3rd and 2nd premolars. The deposition pattern was irregular on 3rd and 2nd premolars, primarily on the disto\u00ad buccal surfaces of the teeth. Light calculus was observed also on mesial surface of the maxillary 1st molar tooth. The canine tooth appeared fairly clean at this age. Gingival inflammation. Assessment of gingivae was based on color, contour and consistency of the tis sue. Inflammation was observed in areas of calculus deposition and ranged from moderate to mild, depend\u00ad ing upon the amount of calculus deposition. It appeared to be limited to the free margin of the gingival tissue. Heaviest calculus deposition was accompanied by swelling, glazing and redness of gingival tissue; this was classified as moderate inflammation. A slight change in the color and contour of the gingival tis sue, classified as mild inflammation, was observed in areas of lesser calculus deposition. 2. Periodic Clinical Assessments of Oral Health Status At 11 months of age, the amount of calculus deposition was increasing, i.e. spreading toward the incisal edge of the 4th premolar and l st molar teeth approximately at mid -crown level. 103 104 At 14 months of age, calculus on the maxillary 4th premolar and the mesial surface of the maxillary 1st molar had definitely progressed to an area between mid-crown and the incisal edge of the teeth. The other maxillary premolars exhibited irregular calculus formation and an accumu\u00ad lation of soft debris. A definite calculus formation was not observed on maxillary canine teeth. Gingival inflammation appeared to be mild to moderate in the maxillary 4th premolar and 1st molar areas. At this time an accumulation of calculus was observed on the mandibular 4th premolar and 1st molar teeth. In addition, stain and soft debris were now observed on the lingual surfaces of maxillary and mandibular teeth accompanied by a very mild gingival inflammation. It was observed that the rate of deposition and the amount of calculus varied even in animals of equ1valent chronological ages. This may be an indication that some animals are more predisposed toward calculus formation and gmgival inflammation. A thorough scaling and prophylaxis were performed on four fe\u00ad males of approximately 14-15 months of age. One side of the jaw was treated, the opposite side serving as the control. The animals, when observed 5-6 weeks after treatment, showed accumulation of calculus and soft debris in a pattern similar to the original condition. On the control side (i.e. no treatment), there was marked separation between the gingival edge of the margin of calculus and gingival tissue. Observations 19-26 weeks after treatment showed similar patterns of calculus deposition and gingival inflammation on the treated and control sides. No differentiation could be made between the treated and control sides of the jaws with respect to their oral health status At 19-20 months of age, calculus deposition on the maxillary 4th premolar and 1st molar had progressed to the mc1sal edge of the teeth. All maxillary teeth can me through the 3 rd premolar showed definite cal\u00ad culus formation at the gingival margin of the teeth, not extendmg to mid\u00ad crown. The degree of gmgival inflammation vaned from moderate to severe, depending upon the amount of calculus deposition. Where the greatest change in color, contour and consistency of gingival tissue was observed, a periodontal leswn (pocket) was also noted Moderate inflam\u00ad mation of lingual gingival tissue was observed around the 2nd and 3rd maxil\u00ad lary premolar teeth together with an accumulatwn of stam and soft debris. Mandibular teeth The canines and 1st and 2nd premolars showed signs of calculus accumulation about the gingival margin. The 4th premolar and 1st molar exhib1ted calculus formation which approached the m1d-crown accompanied by mild to moderate gingival inflammatwn. Mandibular lingual gingival tissue showed mild to moderate inflammation about the 1st, 2nd and 3rd premolar teeth. Synthetic diet animal (No. l 74). This animal, which for about two years had been maintained solely on a diet compounded of casein, sucrose, cottonseed oil, minerals and vitamins, exhibited the same pattern of calculus accumulation as seen in animals on the Rockland diet, but in addition showed an accumulation of soft debris film or stain on all buccal and lingual surfaces of maxillary and mandibular teeth. Gingival inflam\u00ad mation was much more marked, with increased redness, glazing and edema. Radiographic Observations Observations of a limited number of lateral skull radiographs sug\u00ad gested a definite relationship between calculus deposition, tissue inflamma\u00ad tion and alveolar bone disease. The earliest observed alveolar bone changes in this group of animals appeared radiographically in the maxillary 4th pre\u00ad molar and 1st molar areas at 19 months of age. The possibility exists that these changes occur at an earlier age, but lateral skull radiographs were not available. Additional radiographic observations were made on a limited number of beagle hounds varying in ages from 19-72 months. Animals were selected at random from the entire colony. The radiographs showed evidence of marked changes in the supporting structures of the dentition which ultimately may result in loosening and exfoliation of teeth. Semisynthetic Dog Diet The study of the feasibility of using a semisynthetic food for dogs is continuing with the two diet variations previously described. (l) Hemoglobin regeneration studies have now been completed on four\u00ad teen dogs (7 recetved the semisynthetic diet and 7 the control diet). In each group the animals were of two ages -13 months and 7 months at the time of initial bleeding. Approximately 20 percent of the blood was ret?oved from the jugular vein once each week for 5 consecutive weeks. Thereafter, blood was sampled weekly for 6 weeks, biweekly for 6 weeks, and monthly for 5 months. Preliminary study of the data shows that the blood values returned to normal within 5 months after cessation of bleeding in both diet groups and both age groups (Tables 33 and 34). Growth continued normally and appetite was unaffected. The semisynthetic diet appears to be as effec\u00ad tive as the control diet in supporting normal hematopoiesis even under the stress of severe phlebotomy. 105 106 TABLE 33 Effect of semisynthetic diet on hematopoiesis in 7-monthld 851 791 606 771 Control values ngl Red blood cells, 1o6/mm 3 6.89 6.92 7.53 6.25 7.15 7.56 6.80 6.70 cell volume, 'fo 48.0 48.0 37.5 ml 12.0 12.0 9.2 10.0 10.6 10.9 10.4 10.6 Mean corpuscular 3 68.2 50.3 68.7 55.3 59.8 59.5 62.6 Mean corpuscular homoglobin, g 1.8 1.8 1.2 1.7 1.5 1.4 1.6 1.6 Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, 'fo 26 26 25 24 27 26 26 24 Values I day after final bleeding Red blood cells. lo6/mm 3 5.41 4.81 6.12 5.87 6.0 5.4 7.6 8.3 7.9 7.7 7.5 Mean corpuscular volume, 3 53.6 49.9 42.5 51.1 55.9 56.8 51.2 51.4 Mean corpuscular hemoglobin, g 1.5 1.2 1.1 1.3 1.5 1.4 1.4 1.3 Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, 'fo 29 25 21 25 26 25 27 26 Values 5 months after final bleeding Red blood cells, lo6/mm 3 6.72 6.98 8.75 7.95 6.72 10.5 13.2 12.2 11.7 Mean corpuscular hemoglobin, g 2.2 2.2 1.4 1.7 1.8 2.0 1.8 2.0 Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, 'fo 32 33 30 31 24 26 26 27 TABLE 34 Effect of semisynthetic diet on hematopoiesis in 13-monthld 752 Control cells, lo6/mm 3 7.38 7.13 Hemoglobin, Mean corpuscular volume. 3 63.7 65.9 60.7 62.6 65.0 63.5 Mean corpuscular hemoglobin, ug 1.8 1.8 1.7 1.6 1.7 1.7 Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, 'fo 29 27 28 26 26 27 Values I day after final bleeding Red blood cells, lo61mm3 5.75 4.11 4.94 8.0 10.0 9.6 9.6 Mean corpuscular volume, 3 60.9 70.6 60.7 63.1 81.3 70.4 Mean corpuscular hemoglobin, g 1.4 1.8 1.6 1.6 2.2 2.0 Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, 'll> 22 26 26 25 27 28 Values 5 months after final bleeding Red blood cells, lo6/mm 3 8.61 8.84 7.55 7.00 6.94 47.0 47.0 Hemoglobin, gramsfiOO ml 12.6 12.5 12.6 12.2 12.3 12.2 Mean corpuscular volume, 3 60.4 61.7 63.0 67.2 67.8 66.5 Mean corpuscular hemoglobin, 9 1.8 1.8 1.9 2.2 2.3 2.2 Mean corpuscu far hemoglobin concentration. 'fo 30 30 30 33 34 33 The Toxicity of Cs137 Experiment 004 As reported previously, ( 1) dogs given intravenous doses of about 2500 jJ.c of Cs137 per kg did not die. These animals had survived 255 days as of May 31, 1962. Four other 13-month-old beagles have now been given Cs137 intravenously in doses of about 3500 flC Cs137 per kg. Three of these died at about 30 days after injection, but the fourth still survives. The actual values are summarized in Table 35. From the limited sample it is apparent that 3500 flC/kg is close to the LD50;30 for dogs of this age. TABLE 35 Surv1val of beagles following mtravenous administration of 3500 flC flC months at after injection, days of mjection 28 )134 33 35 of inject10n )44 26 )44 27 )44 In an initial attempt to determine the importance of age in radio\u00ad sensitivity of the dog, five 5-month old dogs were g1ven approximately the same dose of Cs137 intravenously Two of these died at about 30 days after injection, the other 3 shll survive m apparent good health {Table 35). It would appear that these younger ammals are at least as radioresistant as the 13-month-old dogs mentioned above -and perhaps even more so. Pathology Methods. Tissues taken as soon as possible after the death of the animal are prepared as histologic sections in one of three ways: 1) fresh, unfixed cryostat-cut sections; 2) acetone -fixed, plastic -embedded, e.g., bone 107 a.nd eye: 3) fixation in The neutral formalin-fixed tissues as well as the plastic\u00ad embedded undecalcified bone sections, are used for radioautographs. The histochemical tests, performed mostly on frozen tissue sectioned in a cryostat, include alkaline and acids. Fifty-five tissues are taken for section. In animals receiving Ce144, many additional lymph nodes from varied locations over the body are taken for section and for radioautographs. In animals injected with Cs137, muscle from many different parts of the body is taken for section. With the latter, organ radioautographs are made from bone and muscle masses. After death, animals are weighed intact,and their total radioactivity is determined. At necropsy, photographs of lesions are taken, each organ being weighed as it is removed and described. When sections for histologic study are removed, each organ is reweighed and stored at -1 0\u00b0C for radio\u00ad activity determination. The sections are cut on the cryostat and stained, whenever possible, on the same day as the post mortem examination. Paraffin and plastic embedding is done later. Photomicrographs are taken of representative lesions from each group of experimental animals. Gross patholo gy. In the two previous semiannual reports(! ,2) the pathologic changes for the flrst groups of Ce144, Cs137, and 'Y -irradiated dogs were described. These dogs included 9 ammals that d1ed following the intravenous injection of Ce144 at 47 J.Lc/kg to 250 J.Lc/kg; 4 that rece1ved Cs137 at approximately 2000 J.LC/kg; 2 pregnant ammals that received Cs137 at 250 J.LC/kg, and their offsprmg; and 5 ammals that received 325 r of 'Y-radiation from a Co60 source. Comparisons of lesions produced by lethal doses of Ce144, Cs137, and ')'-radiation revealed some differences. Hemor\u00ad rhages within muscle were more numerous and extensive in animals re\u00ad ceiving Cs137 Because the h1ghest concentratwns of Cs137 were found in muscle, the extent and severity of hemorrhages found m muscle is not un\u00ad expected; it was estimated that portions of muscle recetved as much as 2300 rads in 30 days. Spermatogenests ceases in an1mals receiving 2000 J.LC/kg of Cs137, whereas after injection w1th Ce144 or irrad1ation with ')'-rays, the process appears to be halted only temporarily. The 5 animals that died following Cs137 3500 J.Lc/kg were dehydrated at necropsy, with blood-tinged fluid about the nares and mouth. Tarry black feces about the anus were observed only m the 13 -month-old animals ( 023 7, 0241 and 0243 ). Large hemorrhagic areas were noted over the jugular veins used for collecting blood samples; the only exception was dog No. 0398. All the dogs had hemorrhages of the paranasal mucosa, and one of the (0398) had necrotic paranasal mediastinum, diaphragm, pericardium, heart and lungs (Fig\u00ad ure 40) in all but one {0398), which had a few scattered petechial to ec\u00ad chymotic hemorrhages in these organs. In the animals with extensive thoracic hemorrhages, adhesions appeared between the visceral and parietal pleura. Hemorrhages occurred in all major organs, muscles and subcutaneous tissue. Only those instances in which hemorrhages were particularly severe or significant will be considered in more de\u00ad tail. Hemorrhages in the heart involved the endocardium, the medulla were extensive and re\u00ad sulted in one instance in filling of the renal pelvis with clotted blood and in macroscopically visible blood in the urine (Figure 41 ). Hemorrhages in the mucosa of the tongue, esophagus, stomach small intestine and colon were petechial to ecchymotic in size. Hemor\u00ad rhagic extravasations occurred in the rectum and adjoining colon, and were associated with ulceration (Figure 42). The spleen was firm, contracted and homogeneously dark reddish\u00ad purple on the surface and cut section. Lymphoid follicles were not appar\u00ad ent on gross examination. The lymph nodes were enlarged, dark reddish-purple and oozed blood-tinged fluid on cut section. The bone marrow was reddish-purple and fatty throughout the shaft and head of the femur. Histopathology. In the lungs, alveoli were filled with acidophilic finely granular material. In scattered areas the alveolar walls were dis\u00ad rupted or replaced by large areas of hemorrhage. Acidophilic granular material similar to that found in the alveoli infiltrated the pleura. Within the edematous fluid were abundant fibrin strands. Marked edematous swelling occurred within the walls of the veins. Bacteria were seen both inside and outside the cells. There were focal areas of necrosis as well as scattered pyknotic and karyolytic nuclei. Within the lumen and in the walls of bronchi and bronchioles large numbers of fat droplets appeared. Fat droplets lay within the cytoplasm of free and fixed histiocytes. Dense alkaline phosphatase activity occurred over the bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium near the free margin, over mucous cells and over alveolar walls. In the latter the deposition was less than in the bronchial epithelium. Myocardial cells had vacuolated nuclei and cytoplasm. In scattered areas the myocardium had undergone hyaline change. The interstitial tis\u00ad sue was prominent, because of relative increase in cell numbers, swelling 109 110 ------------------------------------------------ 1 em I I .. Figure 40.

N l I I ' ' of cytoplasm of fibrocytes, and fibrinoid change in areas surrounding coronary vessels. Myocytes were reduced in size, giving the sections a highly cellular appearance. Alkaline phosphatase activity was patchy in distribution, being limited mostly to the areas surrounding vacuoles. The walls of the coronary veins were markedly edematous. Hemor\u00ad rhagic extravasations were seen occasionally within their walls, but more frequently in the surrounding tissue. Lymphoid tissue within the nodes and spleen was sparse, consist\u00ad ing of a few blast cells surrounded by a narrow rim of lymphocytes, plasma-like cells and hemosiderocytes. Many necrotic cells were inter\u00ad spersed within the malpighian bodies. Occasional foci of necrosis occurred within the germinal center. Nuclear vacuolation and intranuclear acidoph\u00ad granular fibrin strands, hemosiderocytes, necrotic debris and bacteria. Large accumulations of fat droplets were seen within hemosiderocytes, as well as in free and fixed macrophages. Alkaline phosphatase activity was heaviest over the centers of the malpighian bodies and over arterial walls in both nodes and spleen. Acid phosphatase activity was limited al\u00ad most entirely to phagocytic cells. Many myofibers in the trabeculae and capsule of the spleen were hyalinized. Lymphoid lesions in the tonsils, thymus, Peyers patches, and in solitary and aggregated masses appeared similar to those in the spleen and lymph nodes. The tonsils contained ex\u00ad tensive areas of necrosis, multiple ulcers and large bacterial aggregates. Bone marrow was aplastic in the 13 -month-old animals (023 7, 0241 and 0243), and hypoplastic in the 5-month-old ones (0398 and 0401). Megakaryocytes were not recognizable, either being absent or markedly distorted. The marrow cavity contained fat cells, erythrocytes, plasma\u00ad like cells, hemosiderocytes and aggregates of bacteria. In the 5-month-old animals, scattered small foci of erythropoiesis could be found. Organ radioautographs of bones from the 5 -month-old animals showed concentra\u00ad tion of activity in the cartilagenous parts. Liver changes consisted of chronic passive congestion. The dilated central veins and sinusoids were filled by erythrocytes, hemosiderocytes and necrotic debris. The intima of the central vein was edematous and the endothelium either was absent or contained many pyknotic cells. Fat drop\u00ad lets were present in all hepatic cells, with only a slightly heavier deposition in the centrolobular zones. Fat droplets also appeared in blood vessel walls and lumina. Extensive fat deposition occurred in bile duct were observed frequently throughout the liver. Alkaline phosphatase activity was distributed evenly over hepatic cells in the mid and peripheral lobular zones but was missing over the centrolobular cells. Activity was heavy over the bile duct epithelium. Acid phosphatase duct epithelium. 113 114 Special staining of the gastrointeshnal tract was not attempted be\u00ad cause of the rapid autolytic changes associated w1th hemorrhage, ulcera\u00ad tion and bacterial invasion. Because of the importance of the intestinal lesions in the acute irradiation syndrome, these stud1es must be consid\u00ad ered in the future, but they necessitate the use of sacrificed animals. (It has been noted that material taken from hve irrad1ated mice shortly before death is unsatisfactory for cell counts because of advanced autolysis.) In the pancreas a few acinar cells contained acidophilic intranuclear inclusions. Alkaline phosphatase activity occurred over all acini and is\u00ad lets, the intensity being greatest over the islets of Langerhans. In the adrenal gland individual necrotic cells were scattered throughout the medulla. The thyroid gland was htghly cellular, many acini being compressed closely together. Few acini contained colloid, and when present it was fibrillar and weakly ac1dophibc. The acini vaned considerably in size, many havmg little or no lumen Alkaline phosphatase activity over the acinar walls occurred m and w1thout colloid. The testes of two ammals severe damage with no spermatogenesis. Pathobiotlc Sertoli cells and type A spermato\u00ad gonial cells were the only ones seen m one (0398), and m the other (0243) spermatozoa and spermatlds were seen, though rarely Nuclear vacuola\u00ad tion occurred frequently w1thin the remammg cells of the tubules. The no apparent ova or cumulus oopherus (0241) there were five follicles, by the of the granulosa, invasion of the theca mterna and accumulation of blood within the central cav1t1es. In the 5-month old female (0401), there were only a few degenerating Graaf1an folhcles with Cs137, there was an apparent reduction in w1dth of muscle f1bers and an increased cellularity, m comparison with controls of s1milar age. The thickness of the epimysmm was increased through swelmg. Fat droplets were frequently seen lymg along the endomysi J.m Hyahne degeneratwn of muscle fibers appeared in scattered individ1.1al bundles and more frequently in associatwn with areas of hemorrhage While the blood vessel walls were positive for alkaline phosphatase, the muscle bundles were negative. In summary, the lesions in the animals receiving Cs137 were similar to those described previously:(!) widespread hemorrhage, bac\u00ad teremia, pulmonary edema, chronic passive congestion of the liver, lymphoid hypoplasia, bone marrow aplasia and cessation of spermato\u00ad genesis or as in the case of the female, degenerative changes in Graafian follicles. The bone marrow aplasia may be explained in part by prolonged circulation of Cs137 in the blood stream. The lesions were relatively less severe in dog 0398, a 5-month-old male; there was considerably less hemorrhage, and foci of hematopoiesis persisted in the marrow. The dis\u00ad tribution of hematopoietic tissue in long bones of dogs has been reported to vary with age and breed; active tissue is found throughout the shaft up to and occasionally including 6 months, and in rare instances up to 12 months. Such widespread distribution might account for survival of hematopoietic centers in young animals. Hematology Of the four 13-month-old dogs given 3500 J..LC of Cs137 per kg, 3 died from the effects of this dosage, with survival times of 28, 33 and 35 days. In each of the decedents the circulating leukocytes had diminished to about 150/mm3 within 25 to 28 days. The erythrocytes had decreased to one-half to one-third the pre-injection numbers in this same period and the sedimen\u00ad tation rate had reached the maximum possible. A decrease in hemoglobin reflected the decrease in cells; however, cell volume and other factors did not appear to change in these 3 dogs. One dog (0239) survives this dosage of Cs137 although its blood\u00ad forming capacity was affected nearly to the same degree as that of those which died. This dog exhibited one major difference in that its ability to produce leukocytes was showing recovery at the time when the sedimenta\u00ad tion rate was greatest. At 124 days after injection the leukocyte number was only half of the pre-injection value. Erythrocyte numbers in this same dog (0239) were reduced at least 50% after 39 days, but recovery has been slow and persistent since that time. Hemoglobin does not appear to have reduced in proportion to the decrease in number of erythrocytes; this is primarily due to an increased concentration of hemoglobin per cell, although the cells are generally larger also. As a result of this compensatory action this dog did not suffer an anemia comparable to that seen or predictable for the dogs that died. In the five 5-month-old dogs injected with 3500 J..Lc/kg Cs137, the leukocytes in the peripheral blood decreased by factors of 2 to 4 within 9 days. No more than 750 leukocytes /mm3 were recorded from any of the animals on the 23rd day, and there was no correction of this extreme leu\u00ad kopenia. In the 3 dogs surviving on the 28th day the numbers remained at the same level. Erythrocyte numbers had decreased markedly by the 23rd day with a corresponding decrease in packed cell volume. Eosinophilia 115 116 OCCU1\"1'ed on the ninth day in dogs 397, 399 and 401 but counts had returned to normal or below by the sixteenth day. Since dogs 398 and 401 died be\u00ad tween the 23rd and 28th days, eosinophilia could not be correlated with death or survival. There was no evidence of parasitism in these dogs just prior to injection of the Cs137 Urinalysis The successive 16-hr urine samples from dogs 0239 and 0243 (ca. 3500 flC Cs137 per kg) were tested for protein (Albustix,* 3% acetic acid and heat, and sulfosalicylic acid); pentose; and glucuronic acid. Dog 0243 died on the 35th day after injection, while 0239 survives to this date (134 days). All determinations were nega\u00ad tive except those for protein and glucuronic acid. Neither animal excreted protein prior to mjection; on the sixth day after injection, both animals began excreting trace quantities (30-1 00 mg/ 100 ml). Dog 0239 is still excreting this small amount. Glucuronic acid excretion increased appreciably in both dogs after injection of Cs137. Dog 0243 normally excreted 100 ml of urine in a 16-hr period. After injection the volume was maintained at approximately 125 ml/16 hr for 25 days. An abrupt drop to 50 ml preceded death. Con\u00ad trol values for glucuronic acid were 200 f.1.g/ml or 20 mg per 16 hr. Ten to 12 days after injection this value had risen to 300 f.1.g/ml C 30 mg/16 hr). There was then a drop in concentratwn for about ten days to control values: this was followed by a rap1d rise to 550 f.1.g/ml on the 26th to the 31st day. During this period, the total excretion averaged 25 mg, reached a peak of 48 mg on the 24th day and then fell again to 25 mg. Dog 0239 showed a slightly different pattern of excretion in that his urinary volume remained unchanged from a control average of 125 ml/ 16 hr for about 20 days after injectwn. At this time the volume dropped 40% and remained low for about 30 days when it begin to increase slowly to control values. Glucuronic acid, prior to injection, had been excreted at a rate of 150 flg/m.l or 18 mg in 16 hr. After injection, the excretion fol\u00ad lowed a wave-like pattern; the first peak of 300 11g/m1 (or 50 mg/16 hr) occurred on the 19th day; the second of 500 )1 g/ml (45 mg/16 hr) on the 31st day and the third of 900 f.1.g/ml (80 mg/16 hr) on the 43rd day. After each peak, the values dropped to near control levels, By the 60th day the concentration had risen to 300 f.1.g/ml (38 mg/16 hr); this plateau has held for 70 days. *Ames Diagnostic Tests.

Pathology Gross pathology. Yellow discoloration was noted in the skin of the ventral abdomen, foot pads, buccal mucosa and conjunctiva. The hered tightly to the ribs. Little subcutaneous adipose tissue was apparent, and the connective tissue of the abdominal wall had a yellow tinge. A large hematoma (3.5 x 2.0 x 1.9 em) lay over the right jugular vein and the surronding fascia and muscle were and ec\u00ad chymotic hemorrhages occurred in the subcutis over all major parts of the body. The thoracic cavity contained 35 ml of blood-tinged fluid; the lungs were collapsed and pale pink. The pericardium was diffusely edematous and its sac contained 14 ml of clear fluid. The three coats of the heart were studded with hemorrhages of varying sizes. The spleen was small and medium- reddish-purple and, on cut sec\u00ad tion, was homogeneously reddish-purple. The right cervical lymph nodes were edematous, enlarged and dark reddish-purple. Most of the superficial and deep lymph nodes were similar in appearance to those of the cervical nodes, but they varied in size from normal to slightly enrlarged. The liver was firm and yellow-brown with distinct red lobular mark\u00ad ings. The papilla was enlarged, edematous and hemorrhagic. The common bile ducts were patent. Upon cut section, the liver was fatty and had the same distinct lobular markings seen on the surface. The stomach contained blood clots and dark reddish-brown fluid. The mucosae were reddened and contained several nematodes. The lumen of the duodenum and jejunum a reddish-purple pulpy mate\u00ad rial, dark reddish-purple near the stomach and bright red in the ileum. The mucosae of the Jejunum and lower duodenum were the sites of hemor\u00ad rhagic extravasation and ulceration. The large intestines contained black, formed fecal matter. 117 118 The medulla of the kidney was pale yellow , while the cortex was tan, streaked with brown linear markings. A hemorrhagic infarct measuring 1. 6 em at its base appeared in the left kidney. The marrow of the femur was reddish-purple and fatty throughout. The adrenal cortex 1:1. The thymus gland numerous petechial to ecchymotic hemorrhages. Histopathology. Examination of the liver disclosed extensive cen\u00ad trolobular hyaline degeneration and necrosis as well as midlobular fatty change (Figure 43). Both alkaline and acid phosphatase activity were ab\u00ad sent in the centrolobular zone; heaviest phosphatase activity occurred in the peripheral lobular zones. Alkaline phosphatase activity occurred rela\u00ad tively evenly over the hepatic cells, whereas acid phosphatase activity was concentrated over the bile canaliculi. There was a relatively even distribution of radioactivity over the hepatic cells and concentrated radio\u00ad activity over free and fixed phagocytic cells, as determined by autoradio\u00ad graphic studies. The lungs were emphysematous and atelectatic. Thicke.ning of intraalveolar septa was prominent. . Within the lymph nodes, the lymphoid follicles appeared normal in size and number. Large numbers of hemosiderocytes appeared through\u00ad out the medulla and subcapsular spaces and occasionally in lymphoid follicles. Fat stains demonstrated that macrophages throughout the lymph nodes contained large quantities of fat droplets within their cytoplasm. Acid phosphatase activity was heaviest over these phagocytic cells and, as a rule, absent over lymphocytes. Within the spleen, lymphoid tissue was sparce. The sinusoids contained large numbers of hemosiderocytes. Phagocytic cells containing large amounts of lipid droplets were also seen throughout the organ. The glomerular tufts of the kidney were enlarged by increased cel\u00ad lular content and by pink amorphous material. Bowman's space was oblit\u00ad erated; necrotic epithelial cells were seen within the glomerular tuft, as well as within the convoluted tubules. Acidophilic intranuclear crystalloids were numerous within the convoluted tubules. The bone marrow was hypoplastic No megakaryocytes were found in the marrow of the head or shaft of the femur. Foci of granulocytes and erythrocytes were found in which both blast and maturing stages were present. Mast cells were espee1ally numerous throughout the marrow. Autoradiographs of the femur revealed activ1ty localized in the endosteum of the shaft and in trabeculae as well as w1thin the inner layers of both. , Figure 43. Liver of dog 0016, which received Ce144 approximately one year before death. Note centrolobular lipid deposition. Oil red 0 stain. 119 120 Several foci of necrosis and degeneration occurred within the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal gland; the foci of necrosis were also sites of radioactivity (Figure 44). Many acini within the thyroid gland were devoid of colloid and lined by two or more layers of epithelial cells. The acini varied in size, many having little or no lumen. The colloid stained faintly acidophilic. Hematoly. This animal (0016). which died one year after receiv\u00ad ing 25 J.LC of Ce1 per kg, represents the only death among the 10 injected at this dose level. There are also 5 animals out of 7 still living who re\u00ad ceived approximately 50 J.Lc/kg; the 2 deaths at this higher level occurred at 78 and at 90 days after injection. The dogs remaining from the two dose groups have survived over 16 months, and their blood values, although they have not reached pre-injection levels, are either increasing or remaining constant. In the dead animals, lymphoid reeneration was seen both in the two (0022 and 0030) that received 50 J.LC/kg Ce144 and in the one (0016) that received 25 J.Lc/kg. In all three a reversal of the granulocyte / lymphocyte ratio developed; this was noted as early as 59 days after injec\u00ad tion Similar reversals occurred in those surviving the two dose levels, with, however, variations in the time first observed and in the degree of reversal. In the 3 succumbing to Ce144 the erythrocyte count decreased to a million or less coincidentally with the drop in segmented leucocytes. Electron Microscopy Little attention has been given to alterations in the ultrastructure of lymphoid and renal tissue following irradiation. Because of this defi\u00ad ciency, a program was established to study such changes in the kidney, spleen and lymph node of the dog and rat as a result of external and inter\u00ad nal irradiation Observations are also made of normal tissue from animals of known age, source, and history. Materials and Methods The animals used were 5 beagle dogs, l 0 to 16 months old, male and female, and two 2-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats, male and female, averaging 300g (Table 36). Tissues were taken from kidney, spleen and lymph nodes. All of the dogs may be considered as controls except for one (0150), which received 325 r of Co60 )'-radiation unilaterally 76 days before sacrifice. The two Ce144-tracer animals were considered to have received such small amounts of the radionuclide that toxic effects were min1mal or absent. 110 section stained with hematoxylin and eosin.

Observations In sections taken from the interior region of cortical nodules of lymph nodes, both in the dog and in rat, the cells are predominately small lymphocytes, large lymphocytes, primitive reticular cells, occasional macrophages, plasma cells and reticuloendothelial cells containing fibers. The cells are very closely packed with little or no intercellular space. In tissue sectioned at the periphery of the lymph node, near or including a sinus, the cells are farther apart, with considerable intercellular space or matrix between them. The predominant cells in such areas are re\u00ad ticuloendothelial cells with fibers, fixed and free macrophages, plasma cells, and cells of the lymphocytic series in various stages of development. The sinuses contain many large and small lymphocytes and an occasional eosinophil or neutrophil. The cell types observed in the cervical lymph nodes and the spleens of the dog and rat are quite similar. Where species differences exist, they will be pointed out. The lymph node of the rat contains a greater percentage of plasma cells in the lymphoid follicles and sinuses than does that of the dog. The ultrastructure of the plasma cell is very similar in the two spe\u00ad cies, however. The nucleus is spherical and contains large, electron -dense clumps of chromatin distributed both at random and concentrated at inter\u00ad vals along the nuclear envelope. Occasionally a single large nucleolus is seen. The cytoplasm has a complex and extensive endoplasmic reticulum. The cisternae are usually dilated, though empty. In a small number of cells. electron-dense material is seen within the cisternae. Large, round to elongate mitochondria are found infrequently between the membranes of the ergastoplasm. Electron-dense ribosomes are usually associated linearly along the endoplasmic reticular membranes. Frequently a complex Golgi zone is found near the nuclear envelope (Figures 45 and 46). Primitive reticular cells in the dog and in the rat are also very similar. The round to oval nucleus has a rather homogeneous, granular appearance. A single nucleolus is sometimes seen. The cytoplasm is rel\u00ad atively abundant, bounded by a very irregular plasma membrane. Infrequent spherical to elongate, poorly-formed mitochondria, a sparse endoplasmic reticulum with associated ribosomes, and numerous vacuoles can be found. A Golgi complex, however, could not be detected (Figure 47). 123 124 Figure 45. Plasma cell in the cervical lymph node of dog 0248.

The cells of the lymphocytic series are very similar in the dog and the rat. The following descriptions apply to both species. The lymphoblast, intermediate in development between the primitive reticular cell and the large lymphocyte, differs from the former in the shape of its nucleus which is more rounded and regular in outline, also in having a more extensive endop lasmic reticulum and more numerous poorly formed oval to elongate mitochondria (Figure 48).

Very large, elongate to ovoid mitochondria, a distinct Golgi complex, and abundant endoplasmic reticulum can be seen. Electron-dense droplets are often found scattered throughout the cyto\u00ad plasm (Figure 56). Figure 56. Reticular cell with associated fibers from the cervtcal lymph node of dog 0307.

The small lymphocyte of the dog and rat as observed here has a distinct pattern, concentrated at the nuclear envelope. Han(S ) noted in a study of the mesenteric lymph node of the rat that the nucleoplasm of the macrophage had a homogeneous density, containing fine, electron -dense structures, distributed evenly throughout the nucleus except at the nucleolus, where it was concentrated. Sorenson, in a study of macrophages within the popliteal lymph nodes of the rabbit, described a nucleoplasm that varies in density from cell to cell;( 6) in some it is rather electron-lucent, with fine granules evenly distributed throughout the nucleus, as in the rat. In other cells, the nucleoplasm, though homo\u00ad geneous, was much denser. The appearance of lymphoid cells in Sorenson's article may be dissimilar to those described by others by reason of differ\u00ad ences in methods used. Sorenson employed Dalton's osmium dichromate fixative, whereas we and mentioned here have used 2% buffered osmium tetroxide. This difference may also account for the variance in appearance of the nucleoplasm of the plasma cells in rabbits described by Sorenson; as in almost all cells described in his report, it is homogeneous and without pattern.

OBSERVATIONS ON THE INHERITANCE OF HAIR ON THE PINNA OF THE EAR Herman M. Slatis Studies of the genetic effects of radiation on man have stressed the sex ratio of the offspring of irradiated persons as the most sensitive indi\u00ad cator of genetic damage. (l) A large part of the effect on sex ratio is ascribed to a lowering of the proportion of sons among the children of ir\u00ad radiated men, and this is related to dominant lethal effects associated with the Y chromosome. Therefore, it is of direct interest to our interpretation of these sex ratio data that we have information on the role of the Y chromo\u00ad some. As information is collected which shows that th1s chromosome has a very different action in mice and in men, investigations of its role in man must be expanded. Recently, it was suggested that the previously held belief that some tra1ts in man are determined by genes located on the Y chromosome is invalid. (2) This had led to a renewed mterest m the most easily studied of these characters: coarse hair on the pmna of the ear This condition is limited to men and vanes m the frequency of its occurrence in various races. A study has been completed of the frequency of hairy pinna among about 900 men in Israel, where it was found that this type of hair occurs in about one percent of men in then early twenties and in increasing frequency in older men, up to a frequency of about 25 percent in men over the age of sixty. The cond1tion is highly vanable in its expres\u00ad sion and it appears that the country of origm is related to the mode of expression Family studies resulted in the observatwn of 67 male relatives of affected individuals. Of the men over the age of 40, 28 were affected and 9 were not. On the theory that this cond1hon 1s caused by a gene on the Y chromosome, all of these men should have been affected. On the theory that this conditwn 1s caused by an autosomal dommant gene, 20.8 should have been affected, while an autosomal recess1ve gene would have given an expectation of 18.0 affected men. Actually, although there are nine excep\u00ad tions to the theory of Y -chromosome lmkage, they are most frequent m the younger men Only one of the 15 oldest men m th1s senes did not have hair on the p1nna of the ear, though autosomal inheritance theories would have expected about seven to unaffected. These results are confumatory of the original suggestwn that hairy pmna 1S determmed by a Y-linked gene These observations also mcluded studies of other characters and the interrelatwnsh1ps between them There appears to be a relationship between han on the pinna and hair around the external auditory meatus of the ear. However, this relationship is comphcated by the fact that both of these conditions increase in frequency with increasing age. Correction for age does not completely remove the correlation between these two forms of ear hair. Hair on the chest and baldness (which are themselves correlated ) are not significantly correlated with hair on the pinna. Color blindness is no more common in men with hair on the pinna than in other men. This study provides evidence in favor of the theory that the gene for hair on the pinna of the ear is transmitted on the Y chromosome. It suggests that genes of the standard type exist on the Y chromosome, which is con\u00ad trary to a widely held opinion. The interpretation of data on the sex ratio of the offspring of irradiated persons is affected by this finding. We can now suggest that irradiation might cause some Y-linked deaths through dominant lethal gene mutations. Previously, many geneticists had assumed that Y-linked deaths could only be caused through a pair of chromosome breaks, one of which was on the Y chromosome and the other on some other chromosome.

Feinstein and Marilyn Coulon Rationale for the testing of these two agents was extremely tenuous, yet it seemed worth brief preliminary tests: Isonicotinic acid hydrazide (IAH) was found by Yoshikawa et al.(l) to decrease the urinary excretion of taurine by rats. Whole body irradiation, on the other hand, has been found to increase the excretion of taurine.(2,3) Because of these opposing effects, it was considered worth while briefly to test IAH as a possible radioprotector. According to Mcichovi and Selecky,(4) strophanthin actively inhibits the transport of potassium across the membrane of the human erythrocyte. Since radiation usually increases potassium transport, strophanthin was also considered worth a brief test as radioprotector. At radiation doses of 850 r, no significant radioprotective action was found for either agent administered intraperitoneally into mice. The data are given in Table 38.

Rosenthal, Joan Fried Markley, and Arthur Lindenbaum Bone tumor incidence has been correlated with the skeletal content of plutonium following administration of a colloidal form of plutonium to mice, with and without delayed therapy with diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA). Experimental methods have been described.( 1, 2) A single intravenous injection of 2.6 1-Lc/kg of Pu239 was followed in 3 days by single daily intraperitoneal injections of saline or 500 mg/kg of DTPA. The present report summarizes the effects of 2 and of 12 days of DTPA therapy, which have been described in more detail elsewhere. (3) The index of radiation effect used in this study is the proportion of mice that had at least one malignant bone tumor at death. Tumors included are those positive on the roentgenogram (i.e., outside the normal limits of the bone) and those histologically identified in mice that had either roent\u00ad genographic or clinical evidence (paralysis) of a bone tumor. DTPA treatment given for 12 days removed 43 .2o/o of the plutonium deposited in the bone and reduced the fraction of mice with bone tumors by 42.5o/o at the time the last untreated mouse died (515 days), as shown in Figure 57. Treatment for only 2 days had less effect on removal and tumor incidence, and the two indices of effect were not as closely correlated. Additional mice in the treated groups that lived longer than the untreated animals did not raise the final tumor incidence values significantly above those computed at 515 days.

ULTRA FILTER \u00ad ABILITY AND DISAPPEARANCE OF PLUTONIUM FROM PLASMA AS A FUNCTION OF DTPA TREATMENT AND OF THE PHYSICAL STATE OF THE PLUTONIUM Arthur Lindenbaum, Joan Fried Markley, Marcia W. Rosenthal, William M. Westfall and Elizabeth S. Moretti The effect of treatment with diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA ) on increasing the ultrafilterability of plutonium in the plasma and tissues of rats has been described.(!) The plutonium used was injected in essentially monomeric form. Investigations with a polymeric form of plu\u00ad tonium have shown that more of it than of the monomeric form deposits in the liver and spleen and that these deposits are more refractory to removal by DPT A. (2) In view of these differences, it was of interest to compare the early behavior of these two types of plutonium solutions with respect to their ultrafilterability and rate of disappearance in the blood, both in the absence and presence of DTPA. Methods Two plutonium injection solutions were prepared from stock solutions of Pu(N03)4 in concentrated HN03 and solutions of sodium citrate. The one designated as monomeric contained 9. 7 J.l.C Pu per ml; citrate:Pu ratio = 60, pH ::; 6.0. The polymeric solution contained 7.8 J.l.C Pu per ml; citrate :Pu ratio = 2; pH = 7 .1. The degree of polymerization of these solutions was measured by determining the fraction which was ultrafilterable through a cellophane membrane by solu\u00ad 92% ultrafilterable and the polymeric 50%. Ninety Sprague-Dawley female rats, weighing about 250 g, were in\u00ad jected intravenously with the plutonium solutions in either form at 7.2 or 10.6 J.l.C/kg. The treated rats received CaDTPA at 500 mgjkg intraperi\u00ad toneally f hr after plutonium administration; the controls received no in\u00ad jection at this time. Blood was removed at various time intervals by cardiac puncture in duplicate samples which contained blood from at least two rats per sample. Plutonium analyses were performed on whole blood, plasma and plasma ultrafiltrates by a-counting of 25-SO}J.l aliquots directly plated onto planchets. Results The plutonium content of the total plasma was about equal to that of the total blood, indicating that there is no significant fraction of the plutonium contained in the cellular components of the blood. This was expected from the results of Foreman.(3) Figure 59 (upper graph) shows that, although the plasma levels of the two forms of plutonium in the untreated rats were about the same at the beginning ( 40% at hr) and at the end (8-l O% at Z4 hr) of the period ex\u00ad amined, the rate of disappearance was faster for the polymeric form than for the monomeric (at Z hr, polymeric = Zl% and monomeric = 3Z%). DTPA therapy increased the rate of disappearance of both forms markedly; for example, at Z hr after plutonium injection, the Pu levels in the plasma of the treated rats were 4% for the monomeric and 9% for the polymeric. This increase was somewhat greater for the monomeric form than for the polymeric . .. ::0 V> 50 .. -' a. 40 30 a. 0 .... t- -, z 20 ... 0 10 0 ol 0 .... 50 , --- UNTREATED - MONOMERIC DTPA -TREATED 2 3 4 5 6 -- POLYMERIC.

Each point represents a sample of heparinized blood drawn from at least two rats by cardiac puncture and mixed before centrifugation . The percentage of the plasma plutonium that was ultrafilterable was very low for both forms (< 0.01%) in the absence of DTPA therapy (Figure 59, lower graph). Treatment increased this considerably, and exerted a more pronounced and sustained effect on the monomeric form. For example, at 3 hr, the monomeric plasma Pu was about 3 7% ultrafilter able as compared with about 9% for the polymeric plasma Pu; corresponding values at lZ hr were about 10% and 1%. Discussion In untreated rats, the accelerated rate of disappearance of the polymeric form of plutonium as compared with the monomeric is a reflec\u00ad tion of the activity of the reticuloendothelial system in removing colloidal particles. In the present experiment, the difference between the two solu\u00ad tions was not as great as had been expected. It is probable that the solution designated as monomeric contained a mixture of both monomeric and polymeric forms since 8% was not ultrafilter able. This i:s borne out by the 147 148 initially steep slope of the monomeric curve for the untreated animals in Figure 59 (upper graph), and by the fact that in other studies using mono\u00ad meric plutonium (4, 5) the drop in plutonium content with time was shown to be more nearly a straight-line function. The effects of DTPA therapy on increasing the rate and amount of plutonium removed from plasma as well as on increasing the ultrafilter\u00ad ability of Pu from the blood are in accord with the demonstrated therapeutic effectiveness of this compound for plutonium removal.(2 , 6, 7) The fact that these effects are more pronounced on plutonium injected in monomeric form than in polymeric is in agreement with observations on tissues other than blood .(2) These considerations are of clinical interest since plutonium in the blood and tissues of a patient subjected to chemotherapy is more likely to be in a polymeric state than otherwise.

METABOLISM OF METHIONINE AND S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE IN in Neurospora crassa, 5256a and 38706, by determining the amount of S-AM accumulated in the presence of varying concentrations of L-methionine and other compounds in the growth medium. Strain 5256a is a prototroph that can grow in medium lacking methionine, while strain 38706 is a methionineles s auxotroph that cannot convert homocysteine to methionine and requires methionine for growth.( 1) Materials and Methods Organisms. Neurospora eras sa strains 5256a and 38706 were ob\u00ad tained from the American Type Culture Collection and are ATCC 10815 and ATCC l 07 80, respectively. Culture methods. The cultures were transferred monthly to stock agar slants as suggested by Horowitz,(!) using potassium sodium tartrate instead of potassium tartrate. The basal medium of Horowitz and Beadle( 2) was used for the experimental cultures. This medium was dispensed either as 150 ml in 500-ml erlenmeyer flasks or as 40 ml in 240-ml flasks. Steri\u00ad lized media were inoculated with l ml of a water suspension of Neurospora hyphae and conidia and placed on a reciprocal shaker at 25 C for 72 hr. The cultures were harvested by filtration, washed with distilled water and weighed. Determination of S-AM concentration in mycelia. The harvested and washed mycelial mat was extracted overnight in 10 ml/gwet weight of 1.5 !i perchloric acid, and the S-AM was separated from other components on a Dowex 50 H+ column by a modificatio nP) of the method of Schlenk and De Palma.(4) The presence of S-AM in the 6 _!i H2S04 eluate was verified by an ultraviolet absorption spectrum. Resting cell suspensions in the presence of S-AM in the substrate. During some experiments it was noted that the amount of added material absorbing at 260 mf.L decreased in the medium after 72 hr growth. This effect was checked by incubating a sterile, washed, resting suspension of hyphae with S-AM at pH 5. Strain 5256a was inoculated into basal medium without methionine and grown as described above. After 72 hr the mycelium in each flask was individually and sterilely harvested, washed, weighed, and placed in 40 ml 149 150 of substrate. The substrates used we:re the following: (a) 1.07 J..Lmoles/ml distilled and in 2o/o KH2P04 were not inoculated. The flasks were placed on the shaker after 0.1 ml samples of sub\u00ad strate were removed for analysis at 260 mJ..L. At intervals, 0.1 ml samples of substrate were removed and analyzed. After 21 hr the mycelia were harvested, washed, weighed, extracted with 1.5 N perchloric acid, and chromatographed as described above. Results Prototroph 5256a. Mycelia grown in basal medium without methio\u00ad nine and in basal medium plus 5 ,umoles/ml adenosine and 20 mg/ml KH2P04 showed no accumulation of S-AM.

S-AM shows a peak at 256 m,u.(5) The accumulated material was not characterized further. The results of the resting cell suspension are shown in Table 39. There was a 9.4o/o decrease of ultraviolet-absorbing material in the sub\u00ad strate containing S-AM, without added phosphate, after 3 hr and a 54o/o TABLE 39 Loss of substrate S-AM in the presence of a resting cell suspension Neurospora crassa, strain 5256a water plus mycelium S-AM Time after initial inoculation, hr 0 3 8 21 0 3 8 21 0 21 0 21 0 21 0 21 *The substrate was diluted 1:50 for the readings.

The remainder of the substrate S-AM appeared in the total ultraviolet-absorbing material extracted by perchloric acid from the mycelium and was not characterized. Methionineless auxotroph 38706.

No growth was noted in basal medium plus 0.57 j..tmoles/ml adenosylhomocysteine. Discussion Unlike yeast, (5) Neurospora did not accumulate appreciable quan\u00ad tities of S-AM when grown in the presence of excess L-methionine. This was in accord with early work of Smith et .(6) in which it was found that Neuros pora crassa accumulated methylthioadenosine (MTA) to the extent 5. 7 j.lmoles/g and Aspergillus mger 2.5 j..tmoles/g. Under the culture conditions used in these expenments S-AM is chemically stable .(7) However, the disappearance of S-AM from the media may be accounted for by enzymatic activ1ty of the fungus. Shapiro and Mather( 8) described the enzymatic decomposition of S-AM by extracts of Aerobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and noted that l Oo/o of the S-AM was decomposed after 3 hr incubation by the latter two and 25o/o m 3 hr by the first. The rate of loss of S-AM from the medium in which resting cells of Neurospora were placed is in agree\u00ad ment with the results for \u00b7 coli and cerevisiae extracts 1n the presence of S-AM. However, the presence of MT A, one of the decompos1tion products, was not verified in the perchloric acid extract of the mycelia. 151 The slight growth of the auxotroph in medium containing 2.68 J..l.moles/ ml S-AM may be the result of the presence of a small quantity of MTA as a contaminant in the S-AM solution used. It would be of interest to see if the auxotroph could grow with MT A in the medium instead of L-methionine, and an experiment to test th1s point is planned. 152 References 1. Horow1tz, N. H.

BET A-SCINTILLATION COUNTING OF RADIOACTIVE TRACERS ON FILTER PAPER Walter E. Kisieleski and Donald Logsdon Scintillation counting of weak {3-emitters on filter paper has fre\u00ad quently been attempted and in most cases utilized with some degree of success. Radioactive samples are frequently collected on filter paper, lens tissue, or millipo refilten> during the processes of separation or puri\u00ad fication of labeled material. By direct scintillation counting of these samples the difficulties arising from insolubility of the sample in the typical aromatic liquid scintillation solvents are circumvented. Direct counting should also help to overcome the marked decrease in the fluores\u00ad cence efficiency noted when biological samples, in particular, are dissolved in scintillating solutions. -Q:-:_9.

We have investigated the tech\u00ad nique of Roucayrol, ( 1) which consists of wetting a piece of filter paper that contains a deposit of activity with a liquid scintillator solution and counting the paper directly on the surface of a photomultiplier tube. The organic sol\u00ad vent renders the paper relatively trans\u00ad parent, and good light collection is possible. The method was tested by pipetting 0.1-ml aliquots of aqueous solutions of C14, Ca45, and p32 onto Whatman No. 1 filter paper 1 inches in diameter. The active filter papers were dried and then wetted with a liquid scintillator solution containing p-terphenyl (4.0 g/liter} and 1, 4-di\u00ad (2,5-phenyloxazolyl} -benzene (PO POP) in a low volatility solvent, monoisopropylbiphenyl. The impreg\u00ad nated filter paper was placed in a transparent plastic container, in order to avoid tube contamination, and then placed directly on the surface of a Dumont 6292 photomultiplier tube. The scintillation counting assembly without phototube refrigeration or anticoincidence circuitry is shown in Figure 60. 153 154 Counting efficiency for the various isotopes under these conditions of measurement could then be determined, absolute activity having been measured previously by internal scintillation counting. The counting ef\u00ad ficiencies p32, 7 5o/o. The background counting rates were in the order of 1 count per second. Much the same results were found when this procedure was followed using lens tis sue or millipore filters rather than ordinary filter paper. The results indicate that direct filter paper counting can be em\u00ad ployed with good detection efficiency and a minimum of sample preparation. The success with millipore filters also affords the possibility of counting labeled cells or organisms that are usually collected on millipore filters for scoring purposes. Reference 1. Roucayrol, J.

Szczepanik The fractionation of sterols by chromatographic means has been the subject of considerable interest. To date the most prominent of such means has been gas -liquid chromatography. ( 1-3) In parallel development to the analytical determination of the composition of sterol mixtures, sev\u00ad eral groups have reported the fract10nation preparatlve scale isolations facihtate metabolic studies by permitting the recovery of intermediates for chemical and radiochemical examination. Our experiences with the ability of silica gel columns to fractionate esters of cholesterol according to the constituent fatty acid{7 ) suggested that different sterols as the same ester {acetate) might be resolved under similar condlt10ns. The fractiona\u00ad tion of sterol acetates offers one further advantage over the chromatography of free sterols: a means of quantitating sterol composition employmg the acetylating agent.( 8) Such a techn1que could reduce the problems of colorimetry standards for the Lieberman-Burchard reaction as well as those evolving from two types of spectra and two types of reaction rates in this reaction. Early experiences with the fractionation of sterol acetates led to the realization that both the column efficiency and the separation factors in such a fractionation were strongly dependent on the structure of the silica gel employed. Several features contributing to column efficiency (pore diameter and surface energy) have been investigated(9 , 10) we wish to report here the mapping of retention volumes for thirteen sterols on four silica gels whose average pore diameters range from 20 to 170 A. These values permit the selection of a silica gel appropriate for a given separation. Experimental Maten als. Dihydrocholesterol, cholesterol, 7 -dehydrocholesterol and ergosterol were purchased from Nutntional Biochem1cals Corporation and were recrystallized before use. The following sterols were obtained as gifts: a 1:1 mixture of 24, 25-dihyd:rolanosterol-lanosterol from Dr. Paul 0 'Connell (Up john Company); zymosterol from Dr. 0. N. William Gebert from Dr. E. R. Diller (Eli Lilly); agnosterol from Dr. C. H. Duncan (University of Lou1sville); 155 156 methostenol from Dr. W. W. Wells (University of Pittsburgh).

( 12) Sterol acetates were prepared by the micro method of Johnston, et al.(l3) and were purified by column chromatography (?) before use. Silica gels were products of the Davison Company, Baltimore, Md.: they will be designated by their Davison code numbers as #12, #950, MS and #62. The lots used in these studies were characterized by the independent measurements of surface area and pore volume listed in Table 40; these properties have been found to adhere closely to the specifications listed for them by Davison.( 9) All gels were screened to obtain the fraction between 200 and 325 mesh.* The final fraction was rescreened twice to remove all particles smaller than 325 mesh.

The blender treatment is interspersed with screening to remove finer particles. It is adv1sable to use a dozen or so i -inch porcelain balls on each screen to reduce clogging. It is advisable to equilibrate the gels at the relative humidity that provides the lowest retention volume consistent with maxium efficiency. ( 1 \u00b0) This humid1ty must be determined for each type of s1lica gel structure; for #12, #950 and MS a relative humidity of 7o/o appears optimal, for #62, llo/o.* Operation of the column. The column consisted of 110 em of 0.45-cm I.D. glass tubing. At the lower end, a Luer tip was fused to the tubing; at 157 the upper end, a 24/40 standard tapered female joint provided a reservoir above the column bed. A small pad of glass wool was tamped into the bottom of the column, and the Luer tip was plugged by shpping a sealed needle shank over the tip. The column was filled wlth 16o/o benzene 1n hexane (pure grade solvents) and the appropriate gel was introduced into the reservoir through a funnel. The introduction of the gel was followed by stirring and tapping to permit the gel to settle evenly. The column was filled to about 110 em and then allowed to settle whlle draining (assisted, if necessary, by slight posi\u00ad tive pressure from a well-controlled air-pressure source). When settling was complete, the column was shut off and the level of the bed was brought to exactly 100 em by removal of the excess gel: at no time was the bed per\u00ad mitted to become dry. When the bed was prepared, the supernatant solution was removed and the sample (2 to 10 mg total sterol acetates in 16o/o benzene in hexane) was pipetted onto the top of the column. The sample was passed onto the bed and rinsed in wlth a few ml of 16% with an outlet of a 24/40 standard tapered male joint at the bottom, having an inner drip tip, was placed on top of the column and filled with 16o/o ben\u00ad zene in hexane. The column reservoir was filled from the upper reservoir, and elution was begun. The eluate was led through a needle and a length of small-diameter polyethylene tubing to the fractwn collector. It was found advisable to collect the fractions directly in the tubes without the intervention of the usual funnel. The flow rate was set between 15 and 20 ml/hr, or fractions of 5 to 7 ml per 20-mm period. The fractions, or an aliquot of each, were evaporated to dryness, and the sterol content was determined by the Lieberman-Burchard reaction. It was found conven1ent to use two color\u00ad imeters, each set at the appropriate wave length, to measure the blue-green reactions at 660 mJ..L and the yellow reaction at 440 mJ.l.\u00b7 Determination of Relative Elution Volumes. The relative elution volume of a sterol acetate was defined to be the ratio of the volume of sol\u00ad vent reqUJred to elute 50o/o of that sterol to the volume of solvent required *These are provided by desiccators containing saturated solutions of sodium hydrox1de and of lithium chloride, respectively.

The graphic method of determining the SO% point, described earlier, was used in all instances (9) In all runs, 2 mg of cholesterol acetate were used for reference purposes; samples of 0.2 to 2.0 mg of the other sterols (depending upon the color yield of the sterol) were added and the mixture was chromatographed. In those instances in which the relative elution volumes were within 10 to 15% of the sta.ndard volume, final calculations were made on separate elutions of each sterol from two columns run in parallel. Results The relative retention volumes of thirteen sterols on the four Davison gels are listed in Table 41.

The largest range of relative elution volumes appears lo be achieved on a small-pore gel (#12); in part this is due to the selective retardation of sterols with unsaturated bonds in the tail structure. Figure 61 illustrates this feature of gel structure applied to sterols with 2.4, 2.5 double bonds. The three sterols shown all exhibit an increased retention volume relative to cholesterol as the pore diameter of the gel is decreased. A further dis- tinction can be noted in the retardation 2.0 as a function of the hydrocarbon tail structure (Figure 62). The retardation \"' ,. ::> ...J 0 > pore di\u00ad ameter and does not increase to the same extent as does that of the 24-dehydrosterols: furthermore substitution of an ethyl group in the side chain almost completely abol\u00ad ishes the selective retardation.

AVERAGE PORE OIAMETER, A Relative elution volumes as a func\u00ad tion of pore diameter. Several other effects of gel struc\u00ad ture are discernible in Table 41; for ex\u00ad ample, the elution position of a sterol may be changed by a change in pore diameter. Thus in the region between 40 and 100 A, lanosterol will migrate ahead of choles\u00ad terol; below and above this range it will migrate behind cholesterol. Simi\u00ad lar effects are noted in the behavior of sitosterol and stigmasterol, while agnosterol and .6.7-cholestenol, as well as 24-dehydrocholesterol and ?-dehy\u00ad drocholesterol, exhibit \"eros sever 11 behavior with respect to the other. In\u00ad deed the only sterol which maintains the same elution volume relative to cholesterol throughout the whole pore diameter range is t?-cholestenol. Recoveries of each sterol ace\u00ad tate were calculated during these stud\u00ad ies; all but three of the thirteen showed consistent recoveries of 80% to l OOo/o. Zymosterol, 7 -dehydrocholesterol and ergosterol recoveries ranged down\u00ad ward from 75o/o to lSo/o. Of these three, it is likely that the zymosterol sample had already undergone decomposition during prolonged storage in solution, but ergosterol and, in particular, 7- dehydrocholesterol were found to be extremely prone to decomposition upon adsorption on the silica surface.

Several model sepa\u00ad rations are illustrated in Figure 63. These are the resolution of dihydro\u00ad cholesterol and cholesterol (Figure 63a); cholesterol and 24- dehydrocholesterol 63b); (Figure 63c). A preparative scale fractionation of 40 mg of commercial \"lanosterol\" into 24, 25-dihydrolanosterol and lanosterol is shown in Figure 64. Figure 65 shows the chromatogram of the digitonin-precipitable sterols from the liver of an animal which had received 20 mg/kg body weight of \u00b7Triparanol for 7 days and 20 JJ.C of mevalonic acid-C14 30 min be\u00ad fore sacrifice. Only two peaks are detectable colorimetrically, cholesterol and 24-dehydrocholesterol, although traces were found in the interval be\u00ad tween these two peaks (indicated by dots) which were below the level of ' quantitative determinability. The radioactivity in these fractions, measured by liquid scintillation counting, ( 14) showed a number of other features which were of interest. In addition to 65 and 65 z4 sterols, peaks migrating with the elution volumes of lanosterol, 7 -dehydrocholesterol and zymosterol were observed. Two unknown sterols, one with a migration rate consistent with a 67z4 sterol (l5) and the other with a rate consistent with a 657z4 structure bracketed the zymosterol peak but were clearly distinguishable from it. Discussion The establishment of the relative elution volumes of these sterol acetates as a function of silica gel structure serves two purposes: it illustrates the contribution of gel structure to the chromatographic process and it permits the rational selection of a silica gel for a desired separation. It is evident that the elution order of the sterol acetates in these systems is not the same as that reported for the free sterols by Kandutsch and Russell or by Wells and Lorah in they systems. (5, 6) How many of these differences are attributable to the structure of the silica gels used by them and how many to the difference between free and acetylated sterol usage cannot be established at this time. In all three systems (including ours) the addition of angular methyl groups to the sterol nucleus reduces < its retention volume (e.g., methostenol vs. 67-cholestenol, lanosterol vs. zymosterol). The pivotal difference appears to be in the effect of the 6 8 bond which, in the system of Kandutsch and Russell reduces the retention volume compared to that of the 65 bond, while in our system it increases the retention volume (zymosterol vs. 24-dehydrocholesterol).

The utility of these retention volumes in planning separations will, of course, hinge on the column efficiencies which are attainable. Within the load ranges described in these studies, a 1-meter column can resob ... e two components whose retention volumes differ by a factor of 1.15-1.20, the nominal equivalent of 500 to 750 plates. A more detailed prediction of column efficiency cannot be given at this time because it appears to be intimately related to the orientation assumed by the sterol acetate molecules in the adsorbed state. These considerations, however, do not affect the re\u00ad tention volumes reported here. 163 The liver sterols from a Triparanol-treated animal provide an ex\u00ad cellent measure of the utility of this fractionation system. Four previously reported features of sterol metabolism in the treated animal are demon\u00ad strable in the chromatogram {Figure 65); these are 1) that there is negligible incorporation of mevalonic acid into cholesterol; (l6) 2) that there is an accumulation of desmosterol; (l7) 3) that there are appreciable quantities of radioactivity associated with zymosterol, ind1cating a block in its hydro\u00ad genation to zymostenol;( 18) and 4) that a sterol with the properties of a 6.7 24-sterol is detectable. (l5) The close correlat 1on of colorimetric and radiochemical findings in this chromatogram with those results reported by others suggests that the fractionation system described here may be of considerable use in studies of sterol metabolism.

Shapiro Methyltransferases catalyzing the transfer of a methyl group from a suitable methyl donor to the sulfur atom of methionine have been de\u00ad scribed in animals, (1-9) transferase and genes, 3) _K. coli K12 appeared to be unusual in this respect because no other strains of this organism were found to con\u00ad tain this methyltransferase. ( 11 13) Dubnoff had reported that E. coli 113-3 (a vitamin B 12 -methionineless auxotroph of !!.: coli W (ATCC 963 7) gave a growth response to dimethyl- {3-propiothetin plus homocysteine, ( 19) and McRorie et al.(20) found that S-methylmethionine reversed sulfonamide toxicity to : coli (Texas) and coli (Texas) M, a methionineless mutant thereof. Cell-free extracts of E. coli (Texas ) and E. coli (Texas ) M, pre\u00ad pared in a 10 KC Raytheon sonic were assayed for S\u00ad methylmethionine- and S-adenosylmethionine-homocysteine methyl\u00ad transferase by method of Shapiro and Yphantis,(5) using C14- labeled sulfonium compounds, and found to possess the enzyme (Table 42).

Since its isolation by Can toni, (21) S-adenosylmethionine has been thought to be the true '1 active methionine 11 and implicated as the actual methyl donor. S-methylmethionine has been found to occur naturally only in a few plant tissue extracts .(22,23) The lower activity of S\u00ad adenosylmethionine as a methyl donor is paralleled by its lower growth\u00ad promoting activity for intact E. coli (Texas) M, as compared with S\u00ad methylmethionine (Figures 66 and 67). This phenomenon deserves ex\u00ad tensive study. 25011-0-METHrONrNE :;) I I S-AOENOSYL-L-METHrCININI -----1 Growth response of E. coli (Texas) M to L\u00ad and D-methionine and S -adenosylmethionine .

Again, these results raised several questions. McRorie et al.,(20) who have also noted the ability of ethionine to support partial growth of E. coli (Texas) M, sug\u00ad gested that this was due to incorporation of ethionine into protein, a phe\u00ad nomenon which had previously been noted in rats. (24) However, Shapiro and Schlenk (25) have pointed out the existence of ethionine sulfonium deriv\u00ad atives and their physiological activity. Ethionine, in this instance, might be operating by either, or both, of these modes. The same possibilities might explain the partial growth-promoting effects of S-methylcysteine. Wiebers and Garner(2 6) have found that labeled S-methylcysteine methyl groups are incorporated into methionine by Neurospora. This is suggestive of a transmethylation t + t PROPJOTHETIN +HOMOCYSTEINE -----------------Figure 68 Growth response of _t coli (Texas) M to S-methyl\u00ad L -cysteine, S-ethyl-L-cysteine.

Also, S-methyl -D-methionine is promoting agent as S-methyl -L-methionine. The same racemase, or another, may be acting on S-methyl-D-methionine; or the methyltransferase may not be stereospecific. In any case, S-methyl-D-methionine does not appear to inhibit the activity of the methyltransferase toward the L-isomer (Table 44).

The basic reaction mixture and experimental conditions are the same as those described in Table 42. In the reaction mixtures which contain S-methyl-D-methionine, its concentration was 0.2 J.Lmole/ml. It can be seen, in Table 43, that homocysteine and its immediate precursor, cystathionine, have np effect on the growth enhancing activity of any of the active substrates. This might indicate accumulation of homo\u00ad cysteine by E. coli (Texas) M and, therefore, that the block in methionine synthesis occurred at the stage of homocysteine methylation. This bio\u00ad synthetic system is unusual in that methionine is a precursor of one of its own precursors. In the absence of methionine the methylsulfonium deriva\u00ad tive of methionine, necessary for methionine synthesis (or vice-versa) can\u00ad not be formed. However, the observation that the growth-promoting effect of dimethyl- {3-propiothetin towavd intact cells is enhanced by homocysteine raises some doubt that homocysteine really accumulates; this suggests the presence of a dimethyl-/3-propiothetin-homocysteine methyltransferase that might be, but probably is not, identical with S-methylmethionine- and S-adenosylmethionine-homocysteine methyltransferase. As mentioned previously, Dubnoff ( l9) that 113-3 was similarly enhanced by dimethyl-{3 -propiothetin plus homocysteine. A series of experiments is now being carried out to determine the amount of incorporation of label from various compounds into the protein methionine of E. coli (Texas) and E. coli (Texas) M (Table 45). The re- -- sults so far have been rather surprising since, if protein methionine were derived solely from the methionine moiety of the added S-methylmethionine, the specific activity would have been very much higher than it was. The most likely explanation is that E. coli (Texas) M is not a methionine auxo- . - troph and that S-methylmethionine is serving as a source of carbon and methyl groups for other purposes. This can be seen in Table 46. Most of the C14 taken up by the cells is found in the protein fraction, but only a small amount of this label is found in methionine, the only methylated amino acid. Methylation is occurring in the synthesis of lipids, phospholip\u00ad ids, and nucleic acid. If the primary role of methionine is that of a pre\u00ad cursor to a methyl donor, its greater growth-promoting effect relative to S-methylmethionine and S-adenosylmethionine appears rather anamalous. The situation may become clear when this series of experiments has been completed using methionine-Me-C1 \\ S-adenosyl-L-(Me-C14) methionine and S35-labeled S-methyl- and S-adenosylmethionine.

Early experiments indicated that the effects of thio\u00ad phosphate were of especial interest. The work reported here 1ncludes primarily the effects of phosphate compounds on growth and respiration 1n algae, and secondarily the effects of thiophosphate on a mammalian enzyme system i.e., the ATP-inorganic phosphate exchange reaction. Little is known about the effects of replacing orthophosphate by other inorgamc phosphates. By the use of algae, which store large amounts of phosphate as polyph.osphate, it should be possible to determine whether compounds such as diphosphite, hypophosphate, thiophos phate, etc., (a) inh1b1t compet\u00ad itively the utilization of orthophosphate, (b) alter cellular function by some other mechanism, or (c) can be utilized, converted to orthophosphate. and stored in the cell. Summary of Results Phosphate Metabolism of Normal Chlorella. Cells of Chlorella pyrenoidosa, strain 7-11-05, grown in phosphorus-rich media, contain large phosphate stores, sufficient to support growth for 25 days and 5-fold multiplication in the absence of external phosphate. Behavior of such cells is relatively insensitive to the phosphorus concentration of the external medium. The minimum requirement of phos?horus by Chlorella is very small; an initial concentration of 0.5-1 JJ.g P/ml would supply the normal growth needs. On prolonged cultivation in P-free media, the intracellular phospho\u00ad rus level decreases to a minimum of about 2 to 3 x 10-8 jJ.g P/cell, after which division ceases. When phosphate is again supplied, it is rapidly ac\u00ad cumulated within the cell, restoring the phosphate reserves. This accu\u00ad mulation is accompanied by a marked increase of oxygen consumption; approximately one extra oxygen atom is consumed for every two molecules of phosphate accumulated (P/0 ratio :::::::2). Maximal phosphate assimilation and stimulation of oxidative metab\u00ad olism by phosphate were obtained in the range of pH 6.0-6.5. In this range, H2P04 is the predominant ionic species of phosphate, making up about 95 percent of the total phosphate at pH 6.0, and about 80 percent at pH 6.5. If H2P04 were the active form of phosphate, the decreasing effects in alkaline media could be explained since the H2P04 concentration de\u00ad creases rapidly with increasing pH above pH 6.5. The decreased stimula\u00ad tion below pH 6.0 cannot be explained on this basis, however. Possibly low pH alters the 11 phosphate receptors 11 on the Chlorella cell, decreasing their affinity for phosphate in media more acid than pH 6.0. Chlorella cultures synchronized by cycles of alternating light and darkness show a distinct correlation between phosphate metabolism and the stages of the division cycle. Phosphate accumulation is rapid during the early, 11growth 11 phase of the cycle. The rate of phosphate consumption falls off during the 11ripeni ng11 and 11matur ation 11 stages, and remains low during division. These results and those of other investigators ( l-3) on Chlorella and other cells suggest that a reservoir of intracellular phos\u00ad phate compounds, such as the 11 insoluble polyphosphate 11 that is accumulated during the growth phase, is used during the succeeding division. In keeping with this hypothesis\u00b7, inhibition of phosphate accumulation during the growth stages blocks later division far more effectively than does inhibition after accumulation is complete (but still some hours before division). Effects of Phosphate Analogs. Among 6 phosphorus compounds tested for their effects on respiration and cell multiplication, thiophosphate (a known uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation) was the only one that caused an increase in oxygen consumption while inhibiting cell multiplica\u00ad tion. In all other cases, decreases in respiration were accompanied by de\u00ad creases in cell multiplication. Diphosphite and hypophosphate support slight growth and hence are probably converted to phosphate for utilization. Thiophosphate, which does not support growth, presumably stimulates res\u00ad piration by its in stimu\u00ad lating respiration. Azide produces stimulation at concentrations some ten times lower. The concentration of arsenate required for maximum stimu\u00ad lation is similar to those of DNP and thiophosphate, but the extent of stimu\u00ad lation is considerably less. The cause of these differences is unknown. With DNP, azide, and arsenate, very little stimulation of respiration occurs unless phosphate is also present. With thiophosphate, marked stim\u00ad ulation occurs in the absence of phosphate, and the stimulation is actually reduced in the presence of phosphate. It is tentatively suggested that this difference results from the great structural similarity between thiophos\u00ad phate and phosphate. level falls below about 0. 7 th10phosphate rather than stimulates, respiration. Thiophosphate exerts its greatest stimulatory action at about pH 6.0, near the pK2 of 5.8. At this pH, slightly more than half (60%) of the thio\u00ad phosphate present should be in the form of the ionic species H2P03S -, and slightly less than half (40%) in the form of HP03s=. The presence of the maximum effect near a pK2, where no single species is predominant, sug\u00ad gests that pH affects both the ionization state of thiophosphate and the 11 sen\u00ad sitive sites\" of the cell. The extent of reversal of thiophosphate stimulation by phosphate is relatively constant from pH 4.5 to pH 6.0, then decreases rapidly as the pH is raised from 6.0 to 6.5. From the dissociation constants for phosphate, it may be calculated that over the pH range where phosphate is most effective, 93-99% of the phosphate present 1s m the form of H2P04. The sharp de\u00ad crease in the ability of phosphate to reverse thiophosphate inhibition occurs in the pH range m which the proportion of H2P04 ions decreases rapidly with increasmg pH. The curves of respiration vs. pH for phosphate and thiophosphate are very similar, the major difference being that the curve for thiophosphate is shifted toward the lower end of the pH scale. This shift is in keeping with the lower pK2 (5. 8) of thiophosphate as compared with that of phosphate (7 .1). Phosphate uptake by Chlorella is much greater in the light than in the dark Thiophosphate inhibits phosphate uptake in both the light and the dark, but the inhibit10n is stronger in the light. Other uncoupling agents de\u00ad creased phosphate uptake in the light; they were not tested in the dark. With the highest concentration of thiophosphate tested, multiplication was reduced from the usual 4-fold to 2-fold. Twofold multiplication was also noted as a result of phosphate deficiency. It was found to be accom\u00ad panied by division of each mother cell into two daughters, instead of the usual four. Effects of the ATP-P.._ exchange in mitochondria from rat liver. In isolated mitochondria, thiophosphate did not replace phosphate in the forma\u00ad tion of ATP, nor was there evidence for formation of any other complex de\u00ad rivative of th10phos phate in this system, though the electrochromatographic analytical technique which was employed would be expected to detect any such derivative. It is suggested that most of the effects of thiophosphate on the phos\u00ad phate metabolism of Chlorella can be explained in terms of the known abil\u00ad ity of thiophosphate to uncouple phosphorylation from oxidative metabolism, an (assumed) uncoupling effect on photosynthetic phosphorylation. Intracellular accumulation of thiophosphate and the competitive effects of phosphate and thiophosphate on intact cells cannot readily be explained on this basis. These effects may indicate an additional competitive interac-\u00b7 tion of phosphate and thiophosphate for penetration into the cell. References l. Juni, E., M. D. Kamen, S. Spiegelman, and J. M.

Dainko Alkaline hydrolysis of S-adenosylmethionine under mild conditions a pentose-containing sulfonium compound which tenta\u00ad tively has been termed S-ribosylmethionine. (l) It was demonstrated that the unusual lability of the glycosidic bond is caused by the presence of the sulfonium group in the molecule, but details of the mechanism of hydroly\u00ad sis remained obscure. In a recent note, Frank et al. (2) have suggested an ethylenic inter\u00ad mediate with the double bond at carbon atoms 4 and 5 of the ribose. After loss of the adenine, furanoid ring closure at carbon 4 can occur in either direction, yielding derivatives of D-ribose and L-lyxose: - R1 CH5N Ri v H HO OH I Experiments with nonbiological model compounds support this re\u00ad action sequence. Extensive racemization at carbon atom 4 in the carbo\u00ad hydrate part was ascertained by degradation and polarimetry. (2) It appeared desirable to test the proposed mechanism using the biological methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine. In particular, the transi\u00ad tory formation of an ethylenic intermediate appeared amenable to verifi\u00ad cation by carrying out the alkaline hydrolysis in tritiated water. The isotope should be incorporated at carbon atom 5, whether the intermediate forms a D-ribose or L-lyxose sulfonium compound. S-Adenosylmethionine, prepared from yeast as the sulfate, (3) was dissolved in tritiated water, neutralized, and adjusted with Ba(OH)z solu\u00ad tion to 0.1 .!i: All operations were carried out at ice-bath temperature. The concentration of the sulfonium compound was 36.5 f-LM/ml, the radio\u00ad activity of the tritiated water was 2.93 x 109 cpm/ml. After 4 hours the -6 0-- ---- -\u00b7 solution was neutralized and the precipitate of BaS04 re\u00ad moved. Samples of the solution (0 .1 to 0. 3 J.LM) were analyzed by paper chromatography. (!) Scanning of the papers for radioactlve spots showed considerable activity in the orcinol- and ninhydrin-positive material ( 11 S-ribosylmethionine \") formed by splitting of the glycosidic bond of S-adenosylmethionine. The radioactivity persisted after repeated chroma\u00ad tography. No activity was found in the adenine, nor in the methionine ob\u00ad tained by further alkaline hydrolysis at 100\u00b0C for 5 min. It is obvious, therefore, that the activity is located in the pentose. To eliminate the pos\u00ad sibility of a nonspecific tritiation of the carbohydrate part, adenosine, 5'-methylthioadenosine, ribose, and lyxose were exposed under identical conditions to tritiated water and 0.1 N Ba(OH)z. No radioactivity was found \u00b7- in these compounds after chromatographing spots containing 0. 3 J.LM and scanning the papers. 179 For quantitative measurement of the radioactivity in the pentose sulfonium compound, 2.0 ml of the hydrolyzate were analyzed by chroma\u00ad tography with Dowex 50 (H+) resin, l 00 to 200 mesh, in a column 8.5 x 0.5 em, using 1.0 HCl for elution (Expt. A). In a second expenment (B) the mate\u00ad rial was first purified by large-scale paper chromatography of 1.0 ml of hydrolyzate and elution of the bands containing the sulfonium compound; the combined eluates were applied to the column. On elution with 1.0 N HC 1, the pentose sulfonium compound appeared ahead of adenine. Orcin-;-1 tests(4) were carried out to determine its concentration, and liquid scintillation counting was used for assay of the radioactivity. Table 48 shows the data obtained with the appropriate 50-ml fractions of the eluate. TABLE 48 Radioactivity in eluate fractions of S-pentosylmethionine Experiment Pentose, Radioactivity, Specific activity, J.LM/ml cpm/ml 7 0. 043 3005 2 7,400 9 0.131 3474 26,600 \u00b7- In the orcinol tests the time of heating was extended to 40 min, and the acidity of the reference standards was adjusted to match that of the acid eluates. Lyxose and ribose gave virtually identical results. In the 180 determination of the radioactivity, the inhibition caused by the acidity of the eluates was less than 10%; a correction was made by using acidified refer\u00ad ence standards. As expected, the specific activity of the compound was about 50% of that of the water in the incubation mixture (53,000 cpm/J..LM); only one hydrogen or tritium atom is bound per molecule of pentose. The present data on the alkaline hydrolysis of S-adenosy(methionine are in agreement with the mechanism suggested by Frank et al. 2) Transi\u00ad tory de saturation of the ribose and rehydration after, or concomitant with, the splitting of the glycosidic bond is indicated by the uptake of tritium into the carbohydrate part. Because of the racemization resulting from this process the product should be termed S-pentosylmethionine rather than S-ribosylmethionine . References 1. Parks, L. W., and F. Schlenk.

Darling Baker and Mahler ( 1) have recently reviewed the methods available for characterization of mechanisms for two -substrate (or coenzyme\u00ad substrate) systems that obey the rate equation: Eo _ vo ( l) where E0 is the concentration of the enzyme, v0 the initial reaction velocity, C and S the concentrations of coenzyme and substrate, respectively, and the \u00a2' s are constants, the significance of which depends on the mechanism involved. 181 In practice, these constants can be evaluated by measuring the ini\u00ad tial rate for a number of coenzyme concentrations at a series of different substrate concentrations. A plot of 1/v against 1/C will then yield a series of straight lines with intercepts of (\u00a20 + \u00a2 z/s)/E0 and slopes of (\u00a21 + \u00a2 12/S)/E0. Secondary plots of these intercepts and slopes against 1/S will yield lines, from the slopes and intercepts of which the individual constants can be ob\u00ad tained directly, provided the molar concentration of the enzyme is known. Most of the tests for mechanisms depend on measuring each of the constants (in some cases for both the forward and back reactions) under a vanety of conditions; and Baker and Mahler point out that because of the large errors involved in these measurements, some of the criteria have only limited value. This report is concerned with another procedure that can be used to help discriminate between mechanisms of reactions involving DPNH by the use of the stereoisomeric mixture of DPND prepared by nonenzymatic reduction of DPN in D20 (designated hereafter as a, {3-DPND ). In the \"rapid equilibrium\" mechanism, it is assumed that equilib\u00ad rium is rapidly established among the enzyme, substrate, and coenzyme, so that the rate equation (Equation 1) can be written: 1 1 ----- v0 V (2) where Vis the maximum velocity, and the K's are dissociation constants: 182 _ _ (ES)(C) (ESC) ' - (ESC) When a mixture of coenzymes (Ca and Cf3) is used, under conditions where Ca = Cf3 = 0.5 Ct, the total concentration, additional equilibria must be considered, and the over -all reaction velocity then becomes: 1 v l + 1 SCt (3) By comparison with Equation 2, it can be seen that the apparent values of the constants calculated by the method described above are as follows: _ - + [3 The other basic type is a steady-state mechanism, with ordered binding of coenzyme C0 - where C0 is the oxidized coenzyme and Sr is the reduced substrate. When the a, {3-DPND mixture is employed, and Ca = Cf3 -0.5 Ct, the following expression is obtained: Et _ (\u00a21z+\u00a21S)(7f/1z+7f/1S) v s [ \u00a21 ( \u00a21 + 7/11) s] (4) The \u00a2constants represent various combinations of kinetic constants for one species of coenzyme: k5k7 + k5k9 + k5k7 k3ksk7 whereas the 7/J constants are the corresponding combinations of constants for the other stereoisomer. This equation is linear with respect to C, but not with respect to S. Hence the initial plot of 1/v against 1/C would yield straight lines, but the secondary plots would not give linear relationships. ' Equation 4 is also given by mechanisms involving none, one, or three ternary complexes, so that the use of the isotopic mixtures will not differentiate among these variations of the steady-state mechanism. Applications of this test are shown in Figures 69 and 70, which are secondary plots of data obtained with yeast alcohol dehydrogenase and rab\u00ad bit muscle lactic dehydrogenase. These data confirm the observation that the former obeys an equilibrium mechanism(2) and the latter a steady\u00ad state mechanism.

For convenience in presentation, the strata are classified into 4 major zones, A through D, the A zone being at the centripetal pole and containing the least dense of the components. These are the lipid globules, contractile vacuoles and the large irregular vacuoles averaging several mi\u00ad crons in diameter. Stratifying below (centrifugally) these in the A zone are smaller vesicles, about 0.5-2 ll in diameter, and relatively clear cytoplasm. The B zone contains most of the cytoplasm which is essentially clear of vesicles . However, many of the smaller (ca. 0.5 ll to l.O/l) ves\u00ad icles are also present in this zone, suspended by the cytoplasm. The upper {centripetal) portion of this zone contains some larger vesicles (1-5/l), whereas the lower portion of the B zone, at the border of the C zone, con\u00ad tains Golg1 bodies in high concentration. The C zone, by definition, contains the nucleus and all other com\u00ad ponents found within its stratum. The nucleus in Amoeba proteus is large, approximately 40-45 /l in diameter, but no intranuclear stratification was observed. The upper and middle portions of the C zone contain an abun\u00ad dance of Golgi bodies w1th a few mitochondria intermingled. The mitochon\u00ad dria are densely packed below the nucleus at the lower border of the C zone. The nucleus is frequently found lying between the mitochondrial and Golgi strata, essentially on top of the densely packed mitochondria with many Golgi bodies covering and surrounding the nucleus. The upper third of the D zone contains a high concentration of mitochondria. Food vacuoles are found throughout the entire zone, but par\u00ad ticularly in the central area, and crystals in vacuoles are found at the ex\u00ad treme lower portion at the centrifugal pole of the cell. After centrifugation at 10,000 g, electro!l-dense 40 mil-particles that resemble nbosomes are - concentrated in the lower portion of the D zone. 185 186 DEVELOPMENT AS THE MEANS OF MULTIPLICATION OF ORGANELLES AND ORGANELLE SYSTEMS IN PARAMECIUM* / Charles F. Ehret and Gerard de Haller The cell surface of Paramecium not only contains, but is composed of, thousands of ciliated and nonciliated organelles.(2 ) These are so regu\u00ad larly arranged in organelle complexes and systems that structural dia\u00ad grams and formulations can be written for the entire cell surface in terms of unit organelles. (3) From one cell division to the next, thousands of new cilia and trichocysts arise in the new cell surfaces, but little is known about their mechanism of multiplication. The prevailing hypothesis (from studies on other ciliates ) has been that these arise by division of the ciliary basal body. ( 4) Some evidence from light microscopy(2 ) suggests that this is not the case, and we have brought forward the alternative hy-pothesis that as organelles they arise novo: that is, through synthesis and develop\u00ad ment from suborganellar level pools, with specificity determined at the molecular level by interactions of gene products and the microenvironment of the cell. (3) Our general aim was to introduce strict spatial control into a study of the ultrastructural changes associated with the multiplication of organ\u00ad elles and organelle systems at precisely selected phases of the division cycle. (5) More specifically, we have asked what evidence can the electron microscope bring to bear on the mechanisms whereby new cilia, new tricho\u00ad cysts and new systems of organelles such as the gullet are produced in the cell surface. In our studies of about 100 single cells, most of which were fixed in the 45-min period preceding fission and at the height of production of thousands of new organelles, we could see no evidence of organelle division, although we observed well over 105 presumably (according to the old hypothe\u00ad sis) fissionable organelles. On the other hand we clearly established an orderly developmental sequence for each of these cell structures: l) the new gullet with its 1,000 cilia in 3 ribbons, 2) the new trichocysts, and 3) the new body ciliature. Figure 71 shows the new gullet anlage developing on the pellicle wall at the right side of the old gullet at an early stage in its invagination; invagination begins at the anterior end and proceeds posterwrly. *Work done at the Institut de Biophysique and the Laboratoire de Proto\u00ad zoologie, University of Geneva on a USPHS Special fellowship.

The pretrichocysts are distributed through the cytoplasm, and are characterized by a centrally located crystalloid with 70-A spacings. Figure 72. Development of the trichocyst from the pretrichocyst. From left to right: 1) unknown pre -trichocyst; fine-rubuled matrix and crystalloid; 4) crystalloid acquires shape of central core of mature trichocyst; 5) outer portions of tip and body crystallize around central core, cap develops on tip, fine-tubuled matrix diminishes; 6) traces of fine-tubuled matrix present only at body periphery; 7) dense granules having 220-A spacings appear packed about the tip and dispersed about the body. Figure 73 represents the succession of changes in mitochondrion\u00ad like bodies, the vacuolated mitochondria, at and near the cell surface just before cell division. The vacuolated mitochondria are characterized by cytoplasmic invaginations and/or vacuoles containing RNP granules and small vesicles, swollen, distended tubules. The new cilia and ciliary corpuscles develop in intimate association with these bodies, and 1 2 3 4 ? . 2' 3' Figure 73.

The effect of thermal blockade upon these pre-organelles is represented in the lower half of the figure. apparently out of them. When the prefission cell is heated (4 min, 40.5\u00b0C), then cell division is entirely prevented for many hours, despite the pres\u00ad ence of thousands of pre-organelles m the cytoplasm at the time of heat\u00ad ing. The fate of these bodies is represented in the lower half of Figure 73: in this case, following heat treatment the cells were returned to 25\u00b0C for half an hour, then fixed. A primary effect of heat blockade 1s, thus, alter\u00ad ation of normal pre-organelles into the incompetent anomalous bodies shown in the figure. Our complete report will include an analys1s of cytoplasmic diver\u00ad sity and stage-correlated changes in the macronuclear nucleoli. The most significant aspect of this work is not merely the proof of the developmental origin of at least some, and probably all, of the cyto\u00ad plasmic organelles, but the implication of the possibility of experimental control over the processes govern1ng structural differentiation and the synthesis of structural proteins. By illustrat10n, we have represented the black-box precursor of the pretrichocyst as itself composed of black boxes. We must now learn whether these represent uniform heterotypic sets of determinants, of say messenger RNA's on ribosomes, that under one group of physical conditions become trichocysts and under another group of con\u00ad ditions become cilia. Or are pre-organelles determined from the start by the particular assortment of heterotypes in the large box? Are the large boxes constructed by fortuitous collisions, or do quasi-templates, maps and blueprints exist for them? How much of the genomic message\u00ad potential of the cell is impressed upon a given one of its organelles? With our present system, each of these questions 1s not only theoretically valid, but experimentally approachable. References 1. Ehret, C. F. and G de Haller.

Daniels This report presents electron microscope observations of the spores of a microsporidian protozoan, mosquitoes. Typical spores are pyriform in shape and about 5 }1 to 10 }1 long. When the spores are subjected to mechanical pres\u00ad sure, the polar filament, a long, tubular, thread-like structure, is extended; it is approximately 10 times as long as the spore case. In other micro\u00ad sporidian spores the sporoplasm is known to be ejected through the polar filament. In nature, this is presumably the manner in which the sporoplasm is injected into the host tissue with resultant infection. Since Thelohan (l) first published his observations in 1894 on the structure of the microsporidian spore, diverse views have been held about its internal morphology. As seen in life, microsporidian spores are ex\u00ad tremely refractile bodies and reveal no internal structure except a clear space or \"vacuole\" which may be present near one or both ends of a spore. Fixed and stained, the spores show structures variously interpreted as sporoplasm, nuclei, polar filament, and polar capsule. Conflicting obser\u00ad vations and interpretations have been reported not only for different species but even for a single species. (2-5) Recent electron microscope studies have revealed the finer detail of the content of the spore. Materials and Methods The microsporidian studied, Thelohania californica Kellen and Lipa, (b)** was subjected to a thorough light and phase microscopic study prior to our electron microscopic investigation. For permanent light-microscope prep\u00ad arations, smears or sections were fixed in Schaudinn or Carnoy fluid and stained with Giemsa or subjected to Feulgen' s nuclear reaction. For elec\u00ad tron microscopy the spores were fixed in buffered (pH 7 .4) 1% osmium te\u00ad troxide for 1 to 2 hr, dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, and embedded in methacrylate. Sections were cut with a Porter-Blum microtome at 25 to 100 m}l and examined with an RCA EMU- 3E electron microscope. Some other details of the procedure have been published.

Kellen, California State Depart\u00ad ment of Public Health, Fresno, California, for placing the material at our disposal. Light Microscope Observations -. . The spore is broadly pyriform with a narrowed anterior end from which the filament is extruded. At the opposite end is a large conspicuous \"vacuole\" and, except in this area, the spore is highly refractile. Mechan\u00ad ical pres sure on the spore results in extrusion of the polar filament and loss of refractility; hence, this property appears to result from the pres\u00ad ence of the coiled filament. The spore membrane is uniform in thickness and in close contact with the spore contents . Under the phase microscope, the coiled filament is visible in part within spores under slight pressure. Within the open posterior coils of the filament, a rounded mass is often seen projecting in\u00ad to the vacuole. When the pressure on the spore is increased, the polar fil\u00ad ament is extruded. In the spores of microsporidia parasitic in nonaquatic hosts, filament extrusion can be precipitated by rinsing the S.(>ores in dis\u00ad tilled water and drying them on a glass microscope slide; (8,9) this is not true of T. californica. - Feulgen's nuclear reaction reveals a single nucleus in the sporo\u00ad plasm, which usually lies lengthwise within the spore. The nucleus in sporoblasts and immature spores is a more or less compact spherical structure, but in mature spores it is irregularly elongated at a slight angle to the spore axis. Electron Microscope Observations The internal structure of the mature spore is shown in Figures 74 to 77. The outer surface of the spore is usually smooth. The complex, thick outer membrane (Figures 75 and 76, OM) is approximately 200 mJ..L thick and has on its external surface a thin (ca. 100 A) electron-dense bor\u00ad der (Figures 75 and 76, EDB). Immediately surrounding the spore is a relatively thick inner surface membrane (Figures 74 and 75, ISM), which appears to be considerably thicker in the anterior half of the spore than in the posterior half (Figures 74 and 751 ISM). In nearly all spores, the outer and the inner membranes are separate to some degree, leaving a space of approximately 500 mJ..L (as in Figure 74, SPA), but this appears to be an expansion artifact due to fixation and methacrylate polymerization. The space is usually divided into outer and inner compartments by a diffuse line (Figure 75, DL). 191 192 . .

In T. californica this often extends into the postenor region of - the spore, and in some areas appears as minute (25-m,u.) tubules (Figure 75 T). The base of the polar filament (Figures 75 and 76, BPF) is closely adjacent to the anterior tip of the spore and is surrounded by an irregular mass of high electron density (Figure 76, PM) which may be similar to the structure{s) in !:i; locustae called by Huger (lO) polar granules. The polar filament runs inward lengthwise, soon curves obliquely down to come 1n contact with the inner surface membrane and there begins to coil spirally toward the posterior region of the spore PF). Sp1rals most commonly consist of 12-14 coils and the axis is frequently at an angle with the longitudinal axis of the spore. In almost all cases, the polar filament is distinctly and uniformly larger in diameter (200 m,u.) in the first five coils than in the remainder of the coils ( 150 mfJ.) (Figures 74-78, PF, PPF and APF). In the anterior coils the filament wall appears to be made up of 2 to 3 layers of electron\u00ad dense material and is 40 to 50 mfJ. thick (Figures 74 and 76, PF). The filament is tubular in structure; in the five anterior coils the space within the lumen often contains a cylindrical body of high electron density which is about 65 mfJ. in diameter (Figure 77). In other spores the anterior por\u00ad tion of the filament is filled with a uniformly electron-dense material (Figures 74-76). The smaller, distal, or posterior portion of the fllament (7 to 9 coils) has a comparatively thick wall. It appears also to be a hollow tube; the lumen almost always is filled with substances of high electron density (as in Figure 77), but occasionally it is empty. The termination of the filament within the spore has so far not been observed. There is no polar capsule surrounding the coiled polar filament. The sporoplasm, which includes the nucleus, is located postenorly in the spore within the coils of the polar filament and close to the polaro\u00ad plast (Figures 74, 75, 78, SPO). Its cytoplasm contains both granulated and reticulated structures which are relatively electron-dense. The nucleus is single, comparatively large, and is seen in various shapes. The nuclear membrane is shown best in Figure 77, NM. The endosomes are shown 1n the nucleus (Figure 77, EN). Feulgen 1 s reaction confirms that the sporoplasm of mature spores possesses a single elongate nucleus lying obliquely in the area of the coiled filament. . Discussion The great majority of the microsporidian spores fall into one of the two following structural plans(3) on the basis of observations on permanent light microscope preparations. Type 1 consists of pyriform spores in which the anterior two-thirds is occupied by a coiled polar filament, which may or may not be encased in a polar capsule, and in which the sporoplasm is lo\u00ad cated in the posterior and middle parts of the spore. Plistophora macro\u00ad spora(S) is an example. Type 2 or ellipsoidal spores; the sporoplasm, in a girdle-like ring, is located near the middle and surrounds the coiled polar filament which may or may not be enclosed in a polar cap\u00ad sule. An example is Thelohania g1ardi( ll). Exammatlon of the literature suggests that microsporidian spore structure differs much among the dif\u00ad ferent species. Krieg, (l2) apparently was the first to employ electron microscopy 195 for a study of microsporidian spores. He reported the external surface of the spore membrane of Plistophora melolonthae to be corrugated, and the polar filament to be a solid cord He suggested, without electron\u00ad microscopic evidence, that the filament is coiled spirally in the polar cap\u00ad sule. Weiser( 13) reported that the surface of the spore of Nosema laphygmae was generally warty, although sometimes smooth. He considered the degree of shrinkage to be influenced by the fixation and drying of the spore, and we agree with this view. Weiser reported that the sporoplasm lles directly under the spore membrane and in the anterior-median portion of the spore, an ill-defined vacuole in which the solid eter) Lorn and Vavra,( 14) and Ludvik (lS) are in agreement with what we have seen in the spore of T. californica. The - inner and outer portions of the spore membrane and the smooth outer sur- face are similar. Huger's(lO) \"outer spore coat\" appears to membrane,\" his \"inner spore coat\" to our is 500 and his \"surrounding membrane\" like our \"inner surface membrane.\" We have observed in T californica a structure which appears sim\u00ad ilar to the polarplast described by Huger. ( 1 0) The fibrous elements of the polaroplast are distinctly laminated (Figure 76, P) and often reticulated (Figures 74 and 75, P). As to its function, Huger suggested that perhaps it serves \"as swelling substance for increasing the turgor within the spore, thus causing extrusion of polar filament and sporoplasm.\" The polaroplast of.!_. californica extends toward the middle of the spore and, 1n some cases, possibly into the posterior part. The th1ck antenor half of the inner surface membrane may further assist 1n extrusion of the polar filament and the sporoplasm. 196 Huger(lO) noted that the spirally coiled polar filament is embedded in the peripheral region of the sporoplasm. The filament is circular in cross section and its diameter successively decreases from 230 mj..l. at the bast to 70 m11 at the tip. He considers the polar filament of the spore of Nosema locustae to be not a hollow tube but a solid organelle. However, the polar filament of T. californica appears to be tubular although the na\u00ad ture of the contents within the tube is not known. Morgenthaler (8) first suggested that the polar filament of micro\u00ad sporidian spores was tubular after a fluid mass was seen to emerge from the tip of the extruded polar filament of Nosema a pis. More recent reports, culminating in Lorn and Vavra 1 s( 14) demonstration of the process of fila\u00ad ment extrusion and emergence of the sporoplasm in the spore of Plistophora hyphessobryoconis, leave no doubt as to the tubular nature of the polar fila\u00ad ment. When the filament appears solid in electron micrographs, it is be\u00ad cause the lumen of the coiled filament is completely or partially occupied by certain materials. The partial double coiling observed by Huger( lO) in Nosema locustae occurs occasionally in one to a few coils in the distal portion of the fila\u00ad ment in T. californica (Figures 74 and 76, PF). In this connection, it is interesting to note that Kudo( l6) predicted such double coiling in Nosema apis, on the basis of dark-field observations of extruded filaments contain\u00ad ing undulations of two different wave lengths. This prediction has since been confirmed in an electron microscope study of this microsporidian non\u00ad extruded polar filaments in sectioned spores. ( 15) Feulgen's nuclear reaction reveals that the microsporidian sporo\u00ad plasm possesses one or two nuclei;( 4,17) the multinucleation reported by Mercier( ll) and others, apparently does not occur. Seemingly, a uni-or hi-nucleated sporoblast develops without any nuclear division into a mature spore, unlike the process known to take place in the sporoblast and young spore of myxosporidia. Aside from the so-called polar capsule, the spores of Plistophora macrospora(5) and Stempellia magna( 2) are structurally similar to that of Thelohania californica as seen in electron micrographs. Our present con\u00ad cept of the spore of T. californica is presented in Figure 78. References I ' 1. Thelohan, P. Sur 1a presence d'une capsule a Compt. rend. 118, 1425-1427 (1894). 2. Kudo, R. R.

Minick When making autoradiographic studies with the electron microscope, it is often convenient to use the light microscope for orientation. Since preparation techniques for electron microscopy are quite different from those used in light microscopy it is helpful to have a method that can be used for making autoradiographs for either or both light and electron . m1croscopy. Method Tetrahymena pyriformis (W strain) was grown in 50 ml of culture fluid. Three days after inoculation tritiated thymidine (H3T), with a spe\u00ad cific activity of 3 c/millimole, was added to the flasks. The concentration of H3T was 8 !J.C/ml, making a total of 400 !J.C per flask. Twenty-four hours after H3T was added, organisms were fixed for electron microscopy in 1 o/o buffered Os04, pH 7.5 and were dehydrated in 50, 75, 95, and lOOo/o ethanol, 1 0-min changes in each. They were then embedded in a mixture of 60o/o n\u00ad butyl CDB as catalyst, and polymerized overnight in an oven at 60\u00b0C. Sections were cut with stripping film in the Sections were also cut at at 2 11 thickness, placed on glass slides, covered conventional manner, and exposed for 3 weeks. 0.1 !J., placed on grids, and prepared for electron ---DIAMETER If Figure 79. Grid support used for coating grids with nuclear emulsion for electron microscope autoradiography. microscopy as follows: A grid support made from glass was used to hold the grids for the film-coating process, as well as the photographic development procedures (Figure 79). Each grid support was coated with \"subbing solution\" (0.5o/o gelatin and 0.05o/o chrome alum in distilled water), after which one grid, containing sections, was placed on each grid support and al\u00ad lowed to dry in position for at least half an hour. A light-tight box containing about 100 ml water in a 250-ml beaker was set up in the darkroom and a small vial of nuclear track emulsion, type NTB-3, was placed in the water. The box and its con\u00ad tents were placed in a Technicon constant\u00ad temperature water bath at 44\u00b0C. When the emulsion became liquid, a 1:10 dilution was made with distilled water. A platinum loop slightly larger than the grid support was coated with a very thin layer of emulsion and gently stripped down over the grid, depositing a thin layer of emulsion on the grid. The grid support with the grids in place was then put into a light\u00ad tight plastic box containing a small amount of anhydrous CaS04 desiccant (Drierite ). Exposures were made for 3 weeks in a refrigerator at 4\u00b0C, at the end of which time the grid support with grids was removed, placed in Kodak D-19 developer for 5 min, fixed in Kodak acid fixer for 10 min, washed thoroughly in running tap water, rinsed in distilled water and al\u00ad lowed to dry. The grids were then removed from the grid support and ex\u00ad amined in the electron microscope. Results and Discussion Autoradiographs prepared in this manner and examined under the light microscope offer an improvement over those obtained by conventional methods; this may be due in part to the thinner sections (Figure 80) . ..

For the electron microscope good autoradiographs are obtained by this method (Figure 81); however, the technique yields a limited amount of information, because the fine detail is somewhat obscured by partially or wholly developed photographic grains. 199 200 ----- -- - Figure 81. Incorporation of H3-thymidine in nucleus of Tetrahymena pyriformis. Elecuon microscope autoradiograph using the same preparation technique as that in Figure 80. In most cases the detail that can be observed in an autoradiograph is limited by (a) the sprea:d of the image, because the ionizing particles are emitted in all directions, (b) the energy and range of the particles, and (c) the size of the photographic grains. Pelc, ( 1) after consideration of the first two factors mentioned above, concluded that the grain size of the photographic emulsions will ultimately limit the resolving power of the autoradiographs. On this basis one can only hope to make improvements in autoradiographic methods when finer grained emulsions are produced. In electron micrographs it would be useful to have less obscuring of detail, especially if higher magnifications are to be used and smaller sites of labeling are to be traced. One approach toward eliminating the mass of the developed grains is the use of \"physicaP methods of develop\u00ad ment. Techniques for this are available and, in general, consist of bathing exposed photographic material in a solution that can deposit gold. (2) The gold will then become attached to the latent image centers and increase their size enough to be detectable with the electron microscope. Therefore, instead of the entire grain being developed, only the latent image centers, about 60-120 mJl in size, would be visible in the autoradiograph. If this technique can be adapted to electron microscope autoradiography, much more information should be gained. Preliminary results in developing the latent image centers look promising and will be reported in detail shortly. ... .. -... - \u00b7- \u00b7- - -- 0 ... .... 0 0 0 0 - - 0 I wish to thank Walter E.

Since much of the reported work is conflicting and considerable disagreement has resulted, studies on the subject were initiated here. Plants or leaf disks of sunflower, buckwheat, tobacco and bean were X-irradiated. About 1600 plants and over 400 leaf disks were employed, and over 28,000 individual measurements were made. Small, but significant, growth increases were produced in certain instances, but such results were not always reproducible from one experi\u00ad ment to another. Also, when increases did occur, they were not always produced by the same dose levels. On the basis of these results i.e., the amount of variability assoc1ated with the appearance of positive stimulatory effects and the relatively small increases that are produced, it is doubtful that ionizing rad1ations are likely to become useful in increasing agricultural crop yields on a commercial scale, as has been the hope of some investiga\u00ad tors. (This does not include, of course, the successful applications in gen\u00ad etics and plant breeding.) The work also points out that plant tissues respond d1fferentially to ionizing radiations, depending upon the type of growth occurring at the time. Radiation of growing buds, expanding internodes, and expanding leaf disks permitted study of the effects on dividing cells and on expanding cells. It appears that low doses of radiation delivered to dividing cells result in growth depression, but delivered to expanding cells, may result in growth stimulation. *Present address: Northern Illinois University, De Kalb, Illinois. INVESTIGATION OF THE MITOTIC CYCLE OF EHRLICH ASCITES TUMOR CELLS IN VIVO Renato Baserga * and Walter E. Kisielesk1 Preliminary experiments in this Laboratory have confirmed the findings of Hornsey and Howard (l) on the mitotic cycle of Ehrlich Ascites Tumor (EAT) cells growing in the peritoneal cavity of mice. Durmg the exponential phase of tumor growth, these cells have a mean generation time of about 18 hr, partitioned as follows: S phase (DNA synthesis phase) - 11 hr; Gz = 2 hr; prophase = 4 hr; and meta- to telophase 1 hr. During the exponential phase of growth, practically all tumor cells synthesize DNA and divide, and there is no G1 period in the mitotic cycle of these cells. Therefore, when EAT cells are labeled with tritiated thymidine, they can be divided into 4 groups, recognizable by autoradiography and microscopic observation, i.e.: 1) cells in DNA synthesis; 2) cells in the Gz plus early prophase period, not labeled with tritiated thymidine and not in mltosis; 3) cells in late prophase; 4) cells in the period extending from meta- to telophase. To investigate other metabolic activities in the various phases of the mitotic cycle of EAT cells, a two-emulsion autoradiographic technique was designed. (2) This technique takes advantage of the fact that, in nuclear emuls10ns, {3-particles from tritium have an average range of less than 1 IJ., while the {3-particles from C14 have an average range of 10 J.l. If cells are labeled with both radioisotopes and autoradiographed, the emulsion, which is about 4 to 6 J.1 thick, will register {3-particles from both H3 and C14 If now a second emulsion is laid over the first one, the two being sep\u00ad arated by an inert layer of celloidin, this second emulsion, about 5 to 6 J.1 away from the labeled locus, will register only the {3-particles from C14 It 1s then possible to determine if a given cell is labeled only with R (no developed silver grains in the second emulsion), with C14 only (about the same number of silver grains in both emulsions), with both (many more grains in the first than in the second emulsion), or neither. Actually, about half of the C14 beta-particles are arrested by the first emulsion plus cel\u00ad loidin coating, but the decrease in the number of grains in the second ernul-\u00b7 sion is still higher by at least a factor of 10. The technique has been used to study the relative rates of RNA and protein synthesis in the various phases of the mitotic cycle of EAT cells. To determine the rates of RNA synthesis, tumor-bearing mice were injected with tritiated thymidine and C14-uridine. The animals were killed after 30 min, and two-emulsion autoradiographs were made of smears of EAT cells. The emulsion used was NTB bulk emulsion (Eastman Kodak Co.), *Department of Pathology, Northwestern Medical School, Ch1cago, Illinois. 203 204 and the exposure time was 20 days. Comparative grain counts in the sec\u00ad ond emulsion layer showed that EAT cells in the exponential phase of tumor growth synthesize RNA at the same rate for the entire length of the mitotic cycle, with the exception of a very brief penod between late prophase and completion of telophase, during which time no RNA is synthesized.(3) To determine the rates of protein synthesis, tumor- bearing mice were injected with tritiated thymidine and C14-leucine, and two-emulsion atuoradiographs made of the tumor cells, as desc.ribed above. Grain counts in the second emulsion showed that these cells synthesize proteins at a higher rate during the period of DNA synthesis. At the end of the S phase, protein synthesis decreases progressively until it reaches a minimum during the period from meta- to telophase. References l. Hornsey, S., and Howard A.

MET HEMOGLOBIN FORMATION AFTER GLUCOSE OXIDASE INJECTION IN MICE Robert N. Feinstein and Marilyn Coulon The reaction carried out by the enzyme glucose oxidase is: glucose + oxygen glucose oxidase gluconic acid + HzOz For reasons that will be discussed in later sections of this study, glucose oxidase was injected into mice in the hope of raising blood and tissue HzOz concentration. It was shown by Takahara( l) and by Aebi et al.,(2 ) with acatalatic (catalase-free) human blood, that the addition of HzOz will cause methemoglobin formation. This report will describe the production of methemoglobinemia in mice in vivo after the injection of potent glucose oxidase preparations. Materials and Methods Animals used were normal adult female CF#l/ Anl mice. Glucose oxidase was a commercial preparation (\"Type IV\") purchased from Sigma Chemical Corporation, originally obtained from a mold, and so heavily con\u00ad taminated with catalase that, in the absence of a catalase inhibitor (e.g., azide), little or no HzOz will accumulate in in vitro incubation. Total blood pigment and per cent methemoglobin were determined 205 by the technique of Hunter .(3) The figures presented in this report must be considered semi-quantitative only since our spectrophotometer was only secondarily calibrated from another instrument commercially calibrated to read hemoglobin directly; we did not calibrate from oxygen saturation curves, as is necessary for maximum accuracy. Results and Discus sian The results of a series of experiments on the effect of injected glucose oxidase on methemoglobin formation are shown in Table 49. Each figure is the average of three animals. It is clear from this table that (a) the effect on total pigment and on per cent methemoglobin is dependent on the concentration of the injected glucose oxidase; and (b) after higher doses of glucose oxidase, not only does methemoglobin appear in the cir\u00ad culation, but the total blood pigment sharply decreases. Not shown in the table is the concomitant fact that with a decreased total pigment there also appears a considerable decrease in hematocrit . The hematocrit, however, is extremely difficult to read because much 206 pigment has also appeared in the plasma. Animals reaching this stage will not live long; the appearance of visible \"bluing\" of the tail, eyes, etc., is, of course, a very bad prognostic sign. An animal at this stage will ex\u00ad crete highly pigmented urine, and if the mouse is sacrificed, all organs will be found to be dark, the spleen appearing congested with pigment.

Injections were made intraperitoneally. It thus appears qmte probable that there 1s indeed enough H202 pro\u00ad duction to overwhelm the catalase defenses of the erythrocyte and produce methemoglobin. It is also possible that catalatic activity generates suf\u00ad ficient oxygen to disrupt any erythrocytes into which formed H20z has dif\u00ad fused, thus accounting for the decreased hematocnt and the plasma pigment. An interesting point to note is that in vitro, this glucose ox1dase preparation contains so much catalase contaminant that no HzOz accumulates Yet upon intrapentoneal 1njection, we find apparently excess1ve Hz02 for\u00ad mation in the blood stream. The most probable explanation would be that the glucose oxidase, a flavoprotein enzyme, read1ly penetrates membranes, whereas the catalase, a very high molecular weight heme protein, cannot do so. The HzOz-former, and the HzOz-destroyer, are thus perhaps blOlog\u00ad ically separated. Summary The injection of sufficient glucose oxidase into mice causes methe\u00ad moglobin formation, decrease of total blood pigment, appearance of pigment in plasma and urine, and death of the animal.

Feinstein and Marilyn Coulon 0 In the past, the enzyme catalase has been considered an ubiquitous constituent of all living organisms with the single exception of obligate anaerobic microorganisms. Partly because of this distribution, and partly because of the known toxicity of its substrate, hydrogen peroxide,(l) catalase has been considered an essential part of all aerobic existence. It was therefore a most unexpected finding by Takahara (2) that certain Japanese individuals exhibit a total lack of this enzyme in their blood and m those tissues which have been measured. It might be noted that Aebi et al.(3) have also recently, in an intensive screening test, discovered two acatalatic individuals in Switzerland. No animal strain has yet been reported to be comparably low in catalase. Radev ( 4) has developed a hypocatalatic strain of guinea pigs, but these animals, though subnormal in catalase, still have appreciable tissue and blood catalase activity. Because of the considerable advantages to be derived from catalase-free experimental animals in radiation biology and oncology research, some effort is being made here to derive such strains. As a starting point, we have investigated the catalase activity of mneteen different inbred strains of mice. Experimental and Results Approximately five spec1mens of each of 19 inbred mouse strains were obtained by the courtesy of Dr. John Storer, Jackson Memonal Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine. All were males, all were caged at Ar\u00ad gonne for at least two weeks prior to sacrifice, and all were used at 20 to 24 weeks of age. Catalase assays were performed by the perborate method.( 5) Either two or three mice of each strain were blended in the Waring blender for the determination of whole-body catalase, and the rest were sacrificed for blood and liver catalase activities. The results are given in Table 50, where both individual values and averages are listed in order to provide an estimate of intrastrain variabil\u00ad ity. It will be noted that average whole body catalase ranges from 58 units/ g (LP/J) to 114 units/g (MA/J) 145 units/ml (SJL/J and C57BR/cd). Generally liver and whole-body catalase levels correlate well, as 1s to be expected from the fact that, in the mouse, liver catalase represents about 67o/o of the total body catalase.(6) Blood catalase correlates less well with either of the two other parameters. .. 209 TABLE 50 Whole body, liver, and blood catalase of Inbred strains of mice' Whole body Liver Whole blood Strain Individuals Average Individuals Average Individuals Average ST/J 114 114 988 877 104 107 866 106 771 112 SJl/J 95 92 IZ30 1210 138 145 75 1190 149 89 129/J 87 89 1210 1120 126 129 86 1030 131 91 OBAI2J 88 87 1070 1060 90 94 85 1030 94 1080 99 BALB/CJ 96 96 914 1090 112 112 114 1260 Ill 71 C3HeB/FeJ 91 87 1220 1220 88 93 82 1210 96 1240 96 CBAIJ 83 85 1240 1270 120 114 89 1300 108 87 NJ 78 82 1340 1260 123 123 85 1140 124 1310 121 SM/J 76 79 1030 1040 104 100 81 1080 99 1000 98 C57BR/cd 71 75 870 871 Uostl 145 52 871 145 78 RF/J 74 74 874 900 117 109 924 101 MA/J 73 74 849 897 74 74 75 925 74 917 74 BOP/J 74 72 718 955 93 94 70 1010 95 1070 93 BOFdJ 71 77 854 860 110 108 (C5781..6 X 88 872 106 OBA21 73 SWR/J 67 70 876 919 95 96 72 822 96 1060 96 OBA!IJ 64 66 1050 1060 79 80 67 1090 79 1030 81 C578l/6J 55 63 748 820 128 121 69 884 114 71 C58/J 60 60 638 780 Uostl 119 59 872 122 830 116 lPIJ 51 58 1040 1100 113 117 64 1140 116 1130 121 figures are perborate units per g whole body, per g lier, or per ml whole blood. 210 - A- -\u00b7 -- -\u00b7 --- ... 00 0 An experiment is now in progress to exploit these differences further by selective breeding.

Feinstein, Marilyn Coulon, and Elizabeth Thompson* The desirability of reducing the erythrocyte catalase level in cancer therapy by radiation or hydrogen peroxide administration has been dis\u00ad cussed in detail.( l) 3-Amino-1,2,4-triazole (AT) has been shown to beef\u00ad fective in reducing the catalase of all tissues except the erythrocytes.(2) The present report describes other attempts to lower the red cell catalase activity. All catalase assays described were made by the perborate method.( 3) Allylisopropylacetamide. According to Talman et al., ( 4) allyliso\u00ad propylacetamide (AlA)** blocks the synthesis of new catalase in the liver. Price et al. (5) demonstrated a decrease of liver catalase to about 20% of normal after three days of AlA administration. Since the best drug known at present for the prolonged reduction of liver catalase activity, 3-amino- 1,2,4,-triazole (AT), is without effect on erythrocyte catalase, (2) it was hoped that perhaps AlA, working through a different mechanism, might also block the synthesis of erythrocyte catalase. Table 51 shows the results of these studies. Maximum reduction of erythrocyte catalase achieved was approximately 30%, and even this figure could be neither improved nor regularly duplicated. 3-Amino-l ,2,4-triazole (AT) and methylene blue. It is known that, although AT will reduce the catalase activity of lysed erythrocytes, it has no effect on intact red blood cells.( l) Tephly et al.(6) indicate that if methylene blue is added to an in vitro incubation mixture of AT and intact erythrocytes, the catalase activity will be reduced. We attempted the same experiment in vivo. A barely sublethal dose of methylene blue (50 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally into 3 normal female mice. This was followed in 15 min by 750 mg of AT per kg body weight. After a fur\u00ad ther 45 min, the mice were sacrificed, as were 3 mice treated identically except for the injection of saline instead of methylene blue. The average blood catalase levels were: saline, 164 per borate units/ml; methylene blue, 171 perborate units/ml. We have made no effort to verify the in vitro effect of AT and methylene blue described by Tephly et al.(6) *Argonne Semester Student from Knox College. **We are indebted to Dr. W. E.

This compound, which may be regarded as the deaminated \"parent compound\" of AT, was tested for effect on red blood cell catalase, on the rationale that perhaps the modification of electrical charge caused by loss of the amino group would permit the molecule to penetrate the erythrocyte. In the first experiment, with two triazole\u00ad treated and two saline-treated mice, erythrocyte catalase was decreased 48% by the triazole, liver catalase being essentially unaffected. However, in a continuing series of four further experiments, with triazole admin\u00ad istered singly or repeatedly, in doses reaching the lower limit of lethality, it was not again possible to achieve significant catalase inhibition in either tissue. The efficacy of triazole as a catalase inhibitor in vitro has not been tested; it is, however, unlikely that it would be effective since no effect on liver catalase was seen, and the liver cell is generally fairly permeable to low molecular weight agents. o 0 a o o o o 0 .. and Fredrick (?) pre\u00ad pared a glucose \"adduct\" of AT which showed properties distinctly different from those of either parent compound. We have prepared adducts of AT with glucose, galactose, mannose, xylose, arabinose, and ribose. In all these cases, the product showed a negative Fehling's test for reducing sugars, and a decreased test for free AT .(8) Since the latter test involves heating in acid, it is probable that the residual AT test was due to hydrol\u00ad ysis of the sugar-AT compound. These 6 sugar-AT compounds have been tested for effect on the catalase of normal mice. In no case has any effect been observed on either blood or liver catalase. Thus it appears that either these \"adducts\" cannot penetrate even the hepatic cell, or else the compound does not dissociate within the cell to liberate the free, active AT. Sublethal whole-body irradiation. Because it is often suggested, on the basis of a variety of experimental data, that irradiation increases tissue permeability, the possibility was considered that sublethal whole body ir\u00ad radiation might sufficiently increase the permeability of the erythrocyte to permit the entrance of subsequently administered AT. This has been tried, with completely negative results. The over-all conclusion drawn from the above experiments is that no agent or technique has yet been found which will effectively and repro\u00ad ducibly reduce the catalase level of the red blood cell.

Feinstein, Marilyn Coulon, and Elizabeth Thompson* The rationale for testing the effect of nicotinamide (NA) on the growth of the ascites tumor is rather tenuous. It is based on the work of Pantlitschko, ( 1) who found that dilute H202 inhibits the glycolysis of ascites tumor cells, and that this inhibition of glycolysis is completely reversed, even after a period of time, by nicotinamide. On this basis one would ex\u00ad pect, if there were any effect, that NA would accelerate the growth of tumors. The first experiment, in which NA was injected intraperitoneally at 1 gjkg on the day of implantation of the ascites, and on each of the next 4 days, indicated a prolonged survival time in the NA-treated mice. The group of 6 saline-injected mice survived an average of 7. 5 days after the implantation of the tumor; the 6 NA-injected mice survived an average of 11.0 days. The latter figure would have been a trifle higher, but the last 2 survivors, moribund, were sacrificed on the 12th day for humanitarian reasons. In the second experiment, NA was not injected, but rather was in\u00ad corporated into the diet of groups of 5 mice. Preliminary tests indicated that mice consumed, at the normal rate, a diet containing 10 mg NA per gram of powdered standard laboratory chow. Ascites-bearing mice eating plain food survived an average of 10.8 days. Ascites-bearing mice eating food containing NA from the time of tumor implantation survived an aver\u00ad age of 10.6 days. Ascites-bearing mice eating food containing NA begin\u00ad ning on the 4th day after tumor implantation survived an average of 12.0 days. The difference in survival time observed in the injection experi\u00ad ment thus appears due primarily to an unusually rapid death rate among saline-injected mice, rather than to any life prolongation from NA. Ex\u00ad periments with nicotinamide have, therefore, been discontinued. Reference l. Pantlitschko, M., and F. Seelich.

Reviewing the appropriate measurements of tumors reported in the literature }4-13) we have found that the anticipated exponential, or semilog growth of tumors has been observed only rarely, and then only for relatively brief periods of tumor growth. Nearly all re\u00ad ported tumors grow in such a way that the d1ameter (if a solid tumor) or the cube root of total cell number (if an ascites tumor ) when plotted against time gives a close approximation to a stra1ght line. Although this empiri\u00ad cal fact has been clearly established, it is d1fficult to relate such growth either to exponential cell proliferatwn or to the coordinated growth of the normal whole organ1sm. Figures 82 and 83 show, respectively, a semilog and a cube-root plot of the growth of the Ehrlich ascites tumor, from the data of Klein and Revesz. ( 1 0) It the ascites cells had multiplied exponentially, the experi\u00ad mental points should fall on a straight line in Figure 82; instead they de\u00ad scribe a smooth asymptotic curve. The fact that the cube root of cell number plotted agamst time does g1ve a straight hne, as shown in Fig\u00ad ure 83, indicates that the specific growth rate of such tumors decreases with time (i e., the second derivative of the growth curve is negative ), in contrast to semilog growth in which the specific grow:h rate remains constant. In a study of the dynam1cs of normal growth of the human fetus and child, Osgood( 14) showed that when the log of body we1ght or organ weight is plotted against the log of time, a series of straight lines is obtained, connected to one another at 1' inflection points\" which occurred at times known to be associated with physiological changes in the growth rate of the developmg organism. Since both cube-root and log-log growth share the property of deceleratwn of the specific growth rate, it seemed appropriate . to plot the reported tumor measurements against time on a log-log plot. Except for tumors that are known to arouse an effective immune response in the host, growth of all the tumors for which adequate growth data are available has been fitted successfully to a log-log plot. One ex\u00ad ample of such a plot is given in Figure 84 which shows the growth of the Ehrlich tumor, using the same data presented m Figures 82 and 83. It is clear from mspection of the figure that log tumor size plotted against log time gives a very close approx1mation to a straight hne The adequacy of the fit to a straight hne was tested mathematically in two ways: 1) the ratios of the observed to the calculated tumor s1zes were determined for each time interval, and were found for all the tumors, with the exceptions noted above, to vary randomly about a value of 1. 00 throughout the period of log-log growth of the tumors; and 2) when the fit of a quadratic was com\u00ad pared with the fit of a linear equation to the data, the quadratic term was found in all cases to be not significantly different from zero, and the quad\u00ad ratic formulation did not reduce the variance significantly. Hence, one can conclude that a straight line gives a satisfactory representation of the data. en a: w CD ::E => z ...J ...J w (.) en :!: :I: ...._ <l (!) 0 ...J 9t-- 8 7 5.._ 0 I 0 0 AGE OF INOCULUM e 3 DAYS () 6 DAYS 016 DAYS DOSE OF INOCULUM: 1.8=106 T-CELLS 100 200 HOURS AFTER INOCULATION 300 Figure 82.

The exponent k gives the slope of the log-log line. The slopes calculated for a number of tumors reported in the literature are given in Table 52A; for comparison the values calculated by Osgood for nor\u00ad mal growth of the human fetus and child are given in Table 52B.

For tumors with an ex\u00ad ponent sufficiently close to 3, the equation of the log-log line approaches Yf.. = a\u00b7 f, or 3,/W'\" = 3;a . .!.:_ This is the cube root function described by the earlier authors, and for such tumors the diameter will necessarily increase directly with time, giving a straight line when plotted against time on an arithmetic graph. However, when the slope of the line differs greatly from 3, the fit to a cube-root line will be poor. The tumors whose exponents differ from 3 most extremely include two lymphomas with small exponents, ( 11) which were plotted originally as examples of exponential growth, and several of the Walker 256 tumors with exponents greater than 6, which gave slowly rising curves on a cube-root plot, as would be expected for growth with exponents much greater than 3. We conclude that the cube-root growth observed for many tumors is log-log growth in which the slope of the log-log line is approximately 3, but that an exponent of 3 is not a necessary condition for either tumor 219 220 or normal growth. Hence the log-log line is the more general description of the dynamics of tumor growth, of which cube-root growth is a special case. We can conclude further from the nature of the log-log function that tumors generally grow in such a way that the time required for doubling the tumor mass increases in a regular way as the tumor grows, and it is for this reason that the anticipated semilog growth has been observed only rarely, and for only relatively brief periods of tumor growth. Tumor growth, therefore, does not appear to be analogous to the growth of bacteria and other free-living cells in culture. However, it might be more appropriate to look for a resemblance between the dynamics of growth of tumors, which are tissues growing within a metazoan organism, and the dynamics of growth of such an organism and its parts. When we do this we see that indeed both types of growth are well approximated by a straight line on a log-log plot, which indicates that the time required for doubling the total mass increases progressively during growth according to the same mathematical function in both cases. Since the growth of both the whole organism and its parts shows a log-log relation to time, then for simple mathematical reasons, if the log of the size of one part is plotted against the log of the size of another part or of the whole organism, the points will approximate a straight line very closely. This log-log relation between the growing parts of an organism has already been established for a wide range of growth phenomena in many species of plants and animals, including man. ( 15-17) Growth that follows this principle is called allometric growth. In this paper we have shown that tumor growth bears a log-log re\u00ad lation to time, as does the normal growth of its animal host, in whole and in its parts. These relationships suggest very strongly that tumor growth constitutes one more example of the familiar allometric growth. If this is true, then for many tumors, if not all, the tumor plus host together com\u00ad prise a new closed system of growth, analogous to the closed system that defines the normal metazoan organism in its growth and development. When first observed, the log-log relation of tumor growth to time suggests a restriction of tumor growth by an immune response of the host, or by a limitation in the availability of nutritional factors. However, when we note the similarities between log-log growth of the tumors and allometric growth of normal body parts, it becomes evident that the situ\u00ad ation is much more complex than these simple concepts would suggest. Knowledge of the nature of allometric growth and the factors controlling it would offer us a new and important frame of reference for the study of the dynamics of tumor growth. References 1.

Svoboda Much experimental work has been carried out on the induction of chromosome changes by irradiation of Drosophila sperm( l-4) grasshopper neuroblasts ( 13) and various other organisms, but only recently have detailed data been re\u00ad ported on radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations of mammalian cells in vitro.( l4-25) The present paper is concerned with the persistence of chromosome aberrations and radiosensitivity of long-term survivors of pig kidney cells isolated from irradiated populations. Various modern techniques used in conjunction with tissue culture methods have enabled us to study several features of the postirradiation responses of these cells: (a) multiplication rates of whole cell populations and of clones isolated from them by quantitative cell counting; (b) chromosome injuries of specific types (chromatid and isochromatid breaks and exchanges) by spreading techniques; and (c) the course of DNA synthesis as indicated by uptake of tritiated thymidine. In addition, we have examined the radiosensitivities of cells derived from previously irradiated cultures. Briefly, our results show that during the 30 hr following irradia\u00ad tion the frequency of chromosome aberrations increases with time as well as with dose, approaching a theoretical dose-effect relation only at times somewhat beyond 24 hr, and that surviving cells derived from cultures that received 500 r have 1) growth rates inversely related to the frequency of aberrations, 2) different patterns of DNA synthesis, and 3) certain chro\u00ad mosome aberrations that persist indefinitely. Materials and Methods The diploid pig kidney cell line used in these experiments, obtained originally from Dr. Morgan Harris, ( 14) has been maintained in our labora\u00ad tory for 3 years. It is grown on 95 percent Morgan1 s 199 medium with So/o calf serum. The karyotype has remained constant with a stemline number of 37. For subculture, cells were removed by treatment with Versene\u00ad trypsin, counted, and the inoculum adjusted to 1 to 2 x 105 cells/mi. The cells were grown in Leighton tubes and, when tritiated thymidine was used, coverslips were used in these tubes. Cultures were irradiated with 250 kvp X-rays, at 100 r/min. Chromosome studies were made by the smear or air -dry method of Hsu. A more detailed de scription of the methods has been published previously. ( 14) 223 224 Forty or more metaphase smears were scored for chromosome aberrations. A chromatid break was scored when it occurred in one of the two chromatids of a chromosome. An isochromatid break was rec\u00ad ognized as a break appearing on both chromatids of a chromosome, and usually at the same site. Both the former and latter intrachanges were scored as 1-hit phenomena. (25) Chromatid exchanges (interchanges) occur between both chromatids of one chromosome and both chromatids of another chromosome, between both chromatids of one chromosome and one chromatid of one other chromosome, or between chromatids of two different chromosomes. Exchanges were scored as 2-hit phenom\u00ad ena. (25) When the results are calculated as total breaks, exchanges are considered as resulting from 2 breaks. Cell population studies were made on replicate cultures with a Coulter counter after cells were treated with Versene-trypsin (0.25o/o solution) for 10-15 min to produce single cells. In Figures 89 and 90, which were derived from Table 56, the initial cell numbers differed some\u00ad what but were adjusted to one value for the purpose of drawing the graphs. For clarification, B-2, the control, is the original stemline from which a fraction of the population was irradiated with 500 r 9 months earlier; from this surviving fraction, single cells were isolated and 500-r clones (des\u00ad ignated in the text as Clones 3, 8, 10, and 14) were taken. Results Initial Population Studies The pig kidney cell line was irradiated with doses of 200 r, 500 r, or 1000 r 18 hr after subculture, which was just prior to the time when most of the cells were entering their first division. We have previously found, using tritiated thymidine, that at this time 70o/o of the cells are in DNA synthesis, (14) indicating that they are approaching synchrony. Typical growth curves of unirradiated and irradiated cultures are shown in Figure 85. The mean cell number of replicate cultures for each dose given is plotted against time after irradiation. The data give an estimate of the fraction of cells surviving these doses of irradiation. The unirradiated cell population exhibited a nearly exponential increase in growth over a period of 6 days, with a mean doubling time of 1. 35 days (30 hr). Cells exposed to 200 r show a slight delay in cell growth for 48 hr, but after this time the growth rate parallels that of the controls. After 500 r there was a temporary decrease in growth rate beginning 2 days after irradiation, which was followed by an increase between the 4th and 6th day; during the lag period, inhibition of mitosis as well as cell death appeared to play a significant role. A marked decrease in the growth curve was evident after 1000 r 2 days after irradiation. For this particular . -0 0. recovery of cells after 1000 r has occurred in only one or two experiments to date, and the small fraction of cells surviving this dose eventually died.

On this index it is estimated that 25o/o of the initial population survives after 500 r. Early Chromosome Aberrations Visible chromatid breaks ap\u00ad pear soon after irradiation and are detected after doses as low as 50 r.(l5,19) The numoers of chro- mosome aberrations in cells scored at 24, 27 and 30 hr, and 2 weeks fol\u00ad lowing 50 r, 200 r and 500 r are presented in Table 53 as percentages of chromatid breaks, isochromatid breaks and exchanges for each dose and time interval. The proportion of single chromatid breaks (one-hit) scored is higher than that for isochromatid breaks (one-hit, but involving 2 chromatids) or exchanges (2 hits). The data also indicate that for any dose used in this experiment, breaks and exchanges predominate through\u00ad out a 30-hr period, while isochromatid breaks arc fewer. This may be explained on the basis that the majority restitute, or unite with other broken ends to form exchanges which may appear as variants that persist and duplicate.

Other investigators working with mammalian cells (l5, 19) have not reported results paralleling these after 50 r. The discrepancy could find its basis in the time elements of the different experiments. If cells are permitted to go through one or two divisions after irradiation, most exchanges re\u00ad sulting in two centromeres will be lost at anaphase and will not be scored. Since this study was made before the majority of cells began the first division, these aberrant chromosomes were scored. Two weeks after 200 r and 500 r the exchanges decreased to less than 10%, while chromatid breaks increased accordingly. The frequencies of chromatid breaks induced by X-irradiation are presented in Table 54 and Figure 86, as the total number of all breaks re\u00ad sulting from one hit (chromatid and isochromatid breaks) or two hits (exchanges). The breaks per cell increased with dose, but the time of maximum increase changed with dosage. After 50 r and 200 r the maxi\u00ad mum increase was reached between 24 and 27 hr, whereas after 500 r the breaks continued to increase beyond these intervals. Since no cells were scored after 30 hr it is not known whether the maximum was reached at this time. The apparent delay in reaching a maximum value at 24 or 27 hr after 500 r probably reflects the mitotic delay, which is very pronounced after this dose. ( 14) Two weeks after irradiation with 200 r or 500 r the number of breaks per cell diminished to a mtmmum.

The relative efficiencies of the three doses used in producing chromosome aberrations are shown in Table 54 (expressed as breaks/r/ cell). With each dose used there is a different effective time interval and maximum efficiency. Following a dose of 50 r the most effective time after irradiation appeared to be 27 hr, when there were 1. 8 breaks/ r/ cell. With 200 r the relative efficiency was the same at 24, 27 and 30 hr. After 500 r, breaks/ r j cell continued to increase up to 30 hr after irradiation. Since no samples were taken after this time the relative efficiency of this dose could not be determined. .J .J w 0 Q.

Number of Aberrations Per Cell The numbers of cells contain- ing one or more aberrations following 50 r, 200 r, or 500 r are pre sen ted in Table 55. The type of break, chro\u00ad matid or isochromatid, exchanges and total aberrations are likewise found in Table 55 and are plotted against dose in Figure 88. Among the cells having aberrations, one aberration per cell occurs in 61% of the cells for any dose or time period, while 24% of the cells contain 2 aberrations per cell and 8% contain 3 aberrations per cell and 7% have between 4 and 6 aberra\u00ad tions per cell. Isochromatid breaks 27 hr and 30 hr after irradiation in\u00ad creased linearlywith dose (Figure 88). Exchanges increased as the square of the dose at 30 hr, whereas chromatid breaks failed to exhibit linearity at any time period studied. When all after irradiation, the number of breaks was directly proportional to the dose, whereas this was not true at 24 and 2 7 hr after irradiation.

At this time cells of the 200 r and 500 r groups are out of phase with respect to their mitotic and inter mitotic times. Long-term Survivors It was noted from the growth curves that 25o/o of the cells survived 500 r. Single cells were isolated from the surviving fraction a month after irradiation, and 14 clones were established and observed later for cytological and bio\u00ad chemical lesions due to irra\u00ad diation. Four parameters of radiation sensitivity were measured: 1) growth rates, 2) DNA synthesis, 3) chromosome number, and 4) struc- tural chromosome aberrations. Only 5 of the 14 clones isolated for this study survived beyond the first month, although all clones appeared to be growing well during this time, and it was not possible to predict which would survive. Growth rates are shown in Table 56 for three of the five surviving clones. The 500-r clones, designated as numbers 3, 8, and 10, were derived 8 months earlier from a fraction of the control or stemline, designated as B-2, which had been given 500 r at that time. A portion of the cells from the 500-r clones were reirradiated with 200 r, 500 rand, in the case of Clone 3, 1000 r. These appear in the table as 500 r + 200 r, 500 r + 500 r, and 500 r + 1000 r. The data for the 500-r clones before the second irra\u00ad diation (or 9 months earlier) appear in the column labeled \"500 r. 11 The mean cell number over a 7-day period for all groups appears in Table 56, and the 500-r data before the first irradiation, and after a second dose of 500 r, are plotted in Figures 89 and 90. The data indicate that the mean doubling time is longer for the clones 9 months after the first irradiation 230 than for the control stemline BZ(l.5 days). The doubling timewas l.75days for Clone 3, 2 days for Clone 10, and 3.3 days for Clone 8. Clone 3 ap\u00ad peared to be less radiosensitive than Clone 10, and Clone 8 was the most sensitive. The second dose of 500 r depressed the growth rates consider\u00ad ably, and in the order of sensitivity of the clones. Reirradiating the 500-r clones lengthened the doubling time even more. In addition, growth rates of the individual clones were found to be inversely related to the frequency of chromosome aberrations. .. 0 - ..

Points were taken immediately after irradiation with 500 r, given eight months after a first dose of 500 r. DNA Synthesis While the growth rates were being investigated, the rates of DNA synthesis of the 500-r clones were studied by flash labeling with tritiated thymidine. Table 57 shows the extent of incorporation of tritiated thymidine by the control stemline B-2 cells and by the 500-r clone cells. A com\u00ad parison of the stemline B-2 control and B-2 500-r (given at the time the 500-r clones received a second 500 r), as well as the data for the 500-r clones before (designated 500 r) and after the second 500 r (designated as 500 r + 500 r) are shown in Table 57 and Figure 91. The data indicate that the percentage of cells incorporating tritiated thymidine is depressed below the stemline B-2 control values for Clones 14 and 8 both before and after the second 500 r. Clone 14 showed the greatest depression.

The percentage of cells incorporating tritiated thymidine was higher in Clone 10 than in the stemline groups and other clones, whether before or after the second dose of 500 r. The reason for the in\u00ad crease in the proportion of labeled cells in Clone 10 during a 2-day period is not clear, but it could mean either that the synthetic phase is occupying a greater proportion of the intermitotic time, or that a greater proportion of cells is in the synthetic phase at the time of observation due to a synchrony induced by the experimental conditions. In either instance the situation could be caused by a biochemical lesion. Late Chromosome Aberrations The chromosomes of four of the 500 r clones were examined for aberrations 8 and 13 months after the initial irradiation (Table 58). In all cases except Clone 3 the percent of cells with aberrant chromosomes and permanent chromosome aberrations (translocations ) was lower at 13 months than at 8 months. Clone 10, which exhibited an increase in the percent of cells utilizing tritiated thymidne, also had the highest percentage of cells with permanent chromosome aberrations. Clone 14 was the only clone which showed a shift of the modal chromosome number, which decreased from 37 to 35 at 13 months.

At this time the aberrations consisted of chromatid breaks, dele\u00ad tions, exchanges (translocations ), and exchanges with breaks. The variant chromosomes were as high as SO% in Clone 10, 36% in Clone _:._ :.....:.;,. ..;_;_ --\"--- It will be noted that while all of the several clones derived from the stemline a month after it was irradiated were cytologically abnormal and showed depression in their growth rates, the stemline after eight or more months had recovered its original growth rate and other visible characteristics, including response to irradiation. Since all of the aber\u00ad rant clones taken at one month either died out or showed persistently re\u00ad tarded growth rates, it may be assumed that a majority of aberrant cells was present after a month, but that during the ensuing several months they were almost entirely overgrown by the competing uninjured survivors. This is in contrast to the situation prevailing in in vivo blood-cell formation, (26) where the long-term persistence of a rather stable percent\u00ad age of aberrant cells has been indicated. This would appear to find an ex\u00ad planation along the following lines: in vitro, all cells are in competition, and the more slowly growing ones are gradually eliminated, while in vivo, the cells under observation are derived from stem cells which are not in the same sort of competition and which, if injured, may continue indefi\u00ad nitely to yield descendants showing evidence of this injury. It is of particular interest that the dose- effect relation for the various types of chromosome anomaly varies with time after irradiation, and comes much closer to the theoretical relationships at 30 hr than at 24 hr. We have indicated that this may be due to differences in effects of irradiation on mitotic and intermitotic times and on the relative probabili\u00ad ties of appearance of abnormalities at given times after irradiation. This finding makes it clear that in examining dose- effect relationships, the factor of time after irradiation must be carefully evaluated and controlled. The persisting breaks in clones after long-term cultivation are of interest because of the high frequency of apparently identical single\u00ad chromatid breaks, the predominant form of lesion seen under these condi\u00ad tions. It seems reasonable to assume that these are due to an inherent weakness in the chromosome, which frequently but not invariably gives rise to a chromatid having a visible break. Summary A culture of diploid pig kidney cells (37 chromosomes) was irra\u00ad diated with various X-ray dosages. The estimated D0 of this line is 180 rads. Examination of chromosome aberrations 24, 27 and 30 hr after irra\u00ad diation shows that their frequency increases not only with dose but with 233 234 tim a.fter irradiation: this is most mar ked after the higher doses, so that a theoretical dose-effect relation is approached only after 30 hr. At this time, 200 r produces an average of more than one break per cell, and 500 r two or more breaks per cell. Clones started one month after irradiation and kept under cultiva\u00ad tion for 8 or 9 months have variously reduced growth rates, persisting chromosome aberrations, and various alterations in the pattern of thymi\u00ad dine uptake The growth rates of these clones were inversely related to the frequency of aberrations. When the stemline was reirradiated after 9 months' cultivation it showed the same temporary retardation of growth as it did originally; re\u00ad irradiation of 4 of the 5 surviving clones showed a reduction in growth rate that was of longer duration, and more marked in the slower growing ones. The aberrations in the clones, which persisted after severalmonths, were predominantly chromatid breaks or gaps, and in many cases the same break (gap) was seen repeatedly at a particular site on the chromatid.

Brues Experiments have been carried out to study the effects of anticancer drugs on DNA and RNA synthesis in several mouse tumor systems, using tritium-labeled thymidine and uridine. Using these labeled precursors we have measured the biochemical damage to cells resulting from four drugs: 5-fluorouracil D (ACTD), nitrogen mustard (HN-2), and triethylenethiophosphoramide (TSPA). These measurements were made at two different time intervals, using a single concentration or amount of each drug. Further experiments are in progress using different concentrations of the agents and other time intervals. In vivo and in vitro experiments were performed using two mouse tumors; the Ehrlich ascites carcinoma, and the Andervont breast carcinoma. The in vitro preparations included cell cultures, cell suspensions, and tis\u00ad sue slices. Our results show a lack of correlation between in vitro and in vivo labeling of ascites tumor cells with thymidine, possibly because of different metabolic conditions depending on the techniques and media used. Labeling of cells in vitro continues throughout the period of exposure to the radio\u00ad active nucleosides, in contrast to the \"flash labeling11 by an in vivo injection. Synthesis of DNA was effectively inhibited by all drugs as shown by altera\u00ad tions in the uptake of tritiated thymidine and uridine. Methods Preliminary studies were made using human tumors in primary short-term culture. It became obvious that extensive background informa\u00ad tion had to be obtained from animal tumor systems in which replicate ex\u00ad periments could be made. Two transplanted mammary tumors were used: the Andervont tumor carried in the C3H mouse as a solid tumor, and the Ehrlich carcinoma in solid or ascites form. For in vitro studies tissue slices and tissue culture preparations of the Andervont tumor were exposed to the drug in stoppered tubes or flasks at 3 7\u00b0C for 24 hr, followed by incu\u00ad bation with the tritiated nucleoside for 1 hr. In the in vivo experiments tumor-bearing mice were injected with the agents, followed 24 hr later by *Department of Surgery, College of Medicine, University of Illinois, Chic ago, Illinois. 237 238 an injection with tritiated thymidine or uridine. In the case of the Andervont tumor the animals were injected subcutaneously, whereas with the Ehrlich ascites tumor the drugs and labeled precursors were injected intraperitoneally. The concentrations of the drugs used in the in vivo and in vitro ex\u00ad periments are found in Table 59. TABLE 59 Drugs used in the in vivo and in vitro experiments (Dilution in Tyrode 5-FU HN-2 TSPA ACTD In vivo, mg/kg body weight 50 I 1.0 2.0 0.04 In vitro, mg/liter of nutrient 263 I 2.8 I 7.0 0. 35 In the in vivo experiments, the tumors were removed for study 1 hr and 24 hr after drug injections, and 24 hr after the first of 2 drug injections, 5 hr apart. For the in vitro tissue culture experiments the cells were ex\u00ad posed to the drugs for 24 hr. The labeled compounds used for determining DNA and RNA synthesis were obtained from Schwartz BioResearch Inc. Specific activity of tritiated thymidine was 0. 36 curies/millimole and of tritiated uri dine was 0.38 curies/millimole. In either case 1 JJ.c/g of animal was injected. For in vitro studies of ascites tumor cells, samples of about 108 cells (1 ml of ascitic fluid) were suspended in an equal volume of Eagle 1 s nutrient ( 1) plus glutamine, containing the drugs; after removal of the drugs, 12.5 to 25 jJ.c of tritiated thymidine or uri dine in 2 ml of Eagle 1 s nutrient plus glutamine were added. For autoradiography, tumor cells exposed to tritiated thymidine or uridine were plated out on glass slides (in the case of ascites tumor), or were sectioned at 6 fJ. and mounted on glass slides (in the case of solid tu\u00ad mors), or were grown directly on glass coverslips (in the case of tissue cultures). The slides were dipped briefly in warm Kodak Nuclear Track emulsion NTB 3 and placed in a refrigerator in black plastic boxes con\u00ad taining a drying agent until the time of development 7 to 14 days later (or\u00ad dinarily not over 10 days). For microscopic observat10ns the cells were stained through the emulsion with hematoxylin-eosin; estimates were made of the percent of cells labeled and of the number of grains per cell. The number of cells counted in each experimental group was 500 or more; for estimation of the number of grains per cell, 25 to 50 cells were studied. Results In the Andervont tumor, the extent and rate of incorporation of both tritiated thymidine and uridine by the tis sue slices appeared to be corre\u00ad lated with that observed in the solid tumors in vivo. However, with the dosages and the amount of radioactivity used, incorporation was low com\u00ad pared with tissue cultures, and occurred only at the edge of the slice, at the point of greatest exposure to both the drugs and the tritiated compounds. This made quantitative evaluation quite difficult. The cell culture method appeared to be much more sensitive, undoubtedly because of the direct ex\u00ad posure of the cells to the drugs and tritiated compounds, with no competi\u00ad tive action from other body tissues. Data on the action of the four drugs on thymidine and uridine in\u00ad corporation in the in vivo system, using the Ehrlich ascites tumor cells, are presented in Table 60 and Figure 92, which show the percent of cells labeled and the average number of grains per cell. In the case of 5 -FU, the percent of cells labeled with thymidine or uridine was increased over the control after drug treatment for 24 hr, but not after treatment for 1 hr. The percent of cells labeled after 1-hr and 24-hr treatment with HN-2, TSPA, and ACTD was depressed below the controls. The greatest depres\u00ad sion was seen 24 hr after a single injection of HN-2. After 2 injections of any of these 3 drugs, however, the values were comparable with the controls.

Heights of columns indicate the number of cells labeled as percent of controls; figures indicate average grain count per cell. The rate of DNA synthesis is related to the grain count. After 5-FU and thymidine the average number of grains per cell was above control values at each time interval, but grain counts were very much depressed as compared with the controls, after the other 3 drugs. However, after 2 injections of these 3 drugs variable increases in grain counts were seen. With 5-FU and uridine the percent of cells labeled was unchanged after 1 hr but increased over control values at 24 hr. With HN -2 and ACTD there was a decrease in the percent of labeled cells with 1-hr treatment and a return to control values at 24 hr (with 2 injections). Cells treated with TSPA followed a similar course. The average number of grains per cell after uridine decreased to 43% of control value with 5-FU given for 1 hr, whereas there was a signifi\u00ad cant increase above the control value with 24-hr treatment. There was no change from the control value 24 hr after 2 injections of the drug. A de\u00ad pression in grain counts was seen with the other drugs for any time inter\u00ad val or duration of drug, with the exception of HN -2 at 24 hr (2 injections), where there was a 14% increase over controls. A comparison of Ehrlich ascites tumor cells in vivo and in vitro following 1-hr exposure to the drugs and thymidine or uridine is shown in Table 61 and Figure 93. The percent of cells labeled with thymidine after 5-FU was the same in vivo as in vitro; however, a greater percentage of cells was labeled after 5-FU in vitro than in the controls. After HN-2 a greater percentage of cells was labeled in vitro than in vivo. The number of HN-2 treated cells labeled in vitro was 120% of the control value; but only 28% of the control value in vivo. The pattern for ACTD was similar to HN-2 in both cases.

Cells were exposed to the drugs for 1 hr. Hetghts of columns indicate the number of cells labeled as percent of con\u00ad trols; figures indicate average grain count per cell. Control The percent of cells labeled by uridine in the in vivo and in vitro controls was quite different. In the in vitro system 9 5% were labeled, as compared with 45% in vivo. With 5-FU there was an increase of 20% over the control value in vivo, and a decrease to 83% of the control value in vitro. There was a 50% decrease in percent labeled cells after treatment with either HN-2 or ACTD in vivo, and a less significant decrease in vitro. In the controls after uridine the average grain count was 175 in vitro, but only 28 in vivo. The grain counts after uridine and 5-FU were less than half of the control in vivo, but unchanged in vitro. A similar decrease in grain counts was observed in vivo for HN-2 and ACTD, without much dif\u00ad ference from the control value in vitro. Discussion In evaluating these results it must be kept in mind that the percent\u00ad age of cells that are labeled is a measure of the number in the synthetic phase during the one-hr period of labeling (probably somewhat less in the observation in vivo) and that the grain count indicates the rate at which the labeled precursors are incorporated into the DNA that is being synthesized in these cells. 241 242 Both of these indicators were sharply reduced in vivo where thymi\u00ad dine was the precursor and HN -2 and ACTD were the drugs. Where uridine was the precursor, the picture was similar except that the reduction in number of synthesizing cells was more transitory. With 5-FU, there were increases in the rate of incorporation and in the number of cells in the synthetic period. The former may be as sociat\u00ad ed with depletion of endogenous thymidine and uridine due to interference by the drug with de novo synthesis. The increase in the number of labeled cells indicates that a synchrony exists; this might be due to an accumulation of cells in G1 phase (before DNA synthesis) which pass into synthesis when the tracer thymidine and its carrier are given, or to an accumulation in S phase (during DNA synthesis). We have also noticed some accumulation of cells in mitosis, as indicated by a higher proportion of metaphases. It is not clear why two injections of HN-2 and ACTD were less effective than a single injection in reducing the number of labeled cells at 24 hr. It is possible that the mechanism may be similar to that suggested for 5-FU, namely, that a depletion occurs and is relieved by addition of the labeled compound. Further study will be required to test this and other possible explanations. We have noted (Table 61) that the grain counts after thymidine were comparable under in vivo and in vitro conditions, while after uridine the in vitro counts were much higher throughout. This may indicate that (because of competition from other cells) the effective length of exposure of cells to uridine after a single injection is much shorter than is the case with thymidine. This might also account for the lower percentages of labeled cells in ascitic fluid. Reference 1. Eagle, H. The specific amino acid requirements of mammalian cells (strain L) in tissue culture. J. Biol. Chem. STRAINS OF HUMAN TUMORS H.Ad.l AND H.Ep.3 MAINTAINED IN RODENTS Agnes N. Stroud, Beverly R. Svoboda, and Harold B. Haley* Conditioning of rats and hamsters with cortisone and total-body ir\u00ad radiation has made it P.Ossible to maintain a small number of human tumors in laboratory animals. ( 1) Toolan first isolated human tumor H .Ep .3 in 1953( 2) and H.Ad.l in 1955.( 3) Since that time, these tumors have been maintained in her laboratory and in the laboratories of other workers in heterologous hosts, with, however, varying growth characteristics. (4) This communication reports chromosome studies of these two tumors with two objects in mind: 1) to see whether the differing behavior of these tumors in different laboratories can be accounted for on the basis of chromosomal changes, and 2) to examine the chromosome karyotypes of these human tumors which have been maintained in laboratory animals for more than 5 years. In 1956 Levan (5) reported a chromosome structure of tumor H.Ep.3; the chromosome number of H.Ad.l has not been previously published. The principal variation in growth patterns of the same tumor in dif\u00ad ferent laboratories has been in the ability of the tumor to grow in normal unconditioned rats or hamsters. In the original laboratory H .Ad.l will grow only in weanling rats treated with total-body irradiation and cortisone or in weanling hamsters treated with cortisone. In the laboratory of Dr. David Yohn, at the University of Pittsburgh, (4) this tumor has been maintained for more than 45 transplant generations in the cheek pouches of normal un\u00ad treated hamsters. One of us (H.B.H.) is maintaining the tumor in conditioned animals at Loyola University. When taken from a conditioned weanling rat and transplanted subcutaneously as a cell suspension into either 60-g or 200-g untreated rats, the tumor will grow for 2 or 3 weeks as well as it grows in the conditioned rat. After this time, regression takes place, and in most animals the tumor has completely regressed 4 weeks after implantation. In the conditioned rat, no further growth occurs after the 2-to 3 -week period, but the tumor mass usually remains constant in size for many months. In the normal rat, if the tumor is taken after 2 weeks of growth and transplanted to a second generation of normal rat, tumor growth will occur, although it is usually significantly smaller than in the first genera\u00ad tion. When this process is repeated to a third generation, insufficient growth occurs to allow subsequent passage. *Department of Surgery, Stritch School of Medicine of Loyola Univer\u00ad sity, Chicago, Illinoi s. 243 244 We have found HoEpo3 to behave similarly in our laboratory (HoBoHo), and it has not grown in normal animals in Toolan 1 s laboratory 0 Such dif\u00ad ferences in transplantation behavior could be due to changes in the tumor or to variations in defense mechanisms in different strains or substrains of host animals o Methods The basic structure of the HoAdol tumor consists of small clusters of tumor cells enclosed in connective -tissue capsules o The connective\u00ad tissue capsule is so firm that individual cells cannot be easily separated to provide satisfactory 11 squash 11 preparations for chromosome analysis 0 Various combinations of trypsin, Versene, and hyaluronidase have been used unsuccessfully. This tumor does not grow well intraperitoneally; however, for purposes of these experiments, intraperitoneal preparations have been made as follows. H.Ad.l stock in our laboratory (H.BoHo) has been maintained since 1958 in Wistar rats obtained from the Abrams Small Stock Breeders. A tumor is taken at 10-14 days of growth from a stock animal; a suspension of tumor cells is made and injected intraperitoneally into an Abrams weanling rat. At 3 or 4 days after injection, the abdomen is opened and the peritoneal fluid containing tumor cells is aspirated and used for chromosome preparations. H.Ad.l was received by us again from Dr. Toolan 1S laboratory in 1961 in the strain of Wistar rats that she usually used. When the tumor was of proper size, a similar cell suspension was made. Part of the suspension was injected intraperitoneally into Abrams Wistar rats and the peritoneal fluid was withdrawn 3 or 4 days later for chromosome studies. The other part of the cell suspension was injected subcutaneously into conditioned Carworth Farms Wistar rats to maintain the tumor line in our laboratory (H.B.H. ) but not in the animals received from our usual supplier. H.Ad.l was also received by us from Dr. David Yohn as carried in hamster cheek pouches. The same procedure was car\u00ad ried out to obtain peritoneal fluid containing free tumor cells. H.Ep.3 was studied in our laboratory (H.B.H.) two years after re\u00ad ceiving it from Toolan, and also immediately after receiving a second supply of animals. H.Ep.3 contains less connective tissue, and, hence, adequate chromosome preparations can be made from subcutaneous solid tumors. The chromosome smear technique used in this study is a modifica\u00ad tion of that of Moorhead, (6) and Hsu and Klatt. (?) Rats bearing the tumor as a solid or an ascites were injected with 2 jlg of Colcemide (Ciba) per g body weight prepared in Hank 1 s balanced salt solution. At the end of 4 hr, the tumors were removed, and in the case of the ascites the ascitic fluid was centrifuged and decanted. The cells were washed twice in Tyrode 1 s salt solution (minus magnesium and calcium), placed in a centrifuge tube containing 10 ml of 0.25% trypsin-Versene solution, and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 15 to 30 min. After this time the suspension was mixed by pipetting vigorously. Following this the cells and supernatant were poured through a fine nylon mesh to remove fragments of tissue not broken up by this pro\u00ad cedure. The cells and supernatant were then centrifuged, decanted, and washed in 5 ml of warm Hank's solution, leaving 0.5 ml after the last wash, and adding 1.5 ml of warm distilled water to form a hypotonic solution. After 3 min in the hypotonic solution the cells were centrifuged for 5 min; the supernatant solution was then decanted, after which 5 ml of fresh fixa\u00ad tive solution (absolute ethanol, 3 parts, glacial acetic acid, 1 part) was added to the pellet and left undisturbed for 20 min. Following this, the cells were centrifuged, the fixative was decanted, and the cells were resuspended in fixative and centrifuged for 5 min. To the pellet of cells was added 0.5-1.0 ml fixative; they were then plated out on pre cleaned glass slides which had been dipped in cold ice water. The cells were allowed to air-245 dry on the slides and for immediate observations were stained with a 2% so\u00ad lution of Gurr's synthetic Orcein. We found about 10-15% of the chromosomes spread at metaphase to be uncountable. For this study 30 or more cells were scored in each line. Results H.Ep.3 Tumor Levan reported in 1956 that the chromosome number of H.Ep.3 was 69 with a range of 64-74.( 5) The chromosomes were characteristic of the human. He consistently found 3 or 4 chromosomes carrying satellites, which he considered sufficiently distinctive to be used as markers for this tumor. We examined the metaphase chromosome spreads for H.Ep.3 both as carried currently in Toolan's laboratory (Figure 94) and as carried by us 45 successive passages away from Toolan's laboratory (Figure 95). H.Ep.3 appeared to have essentially the same chromosome distribution as reported by Dr. Levan five years ago (Figures 94 and 95 ); the marker satellites were as he described. In the same tumor suspensions were found cells with 69 chromosomes that appeared typically human, plus satellites, and, also in the same tissue, other cells with 42 chromosomes of typical rat mor\u00ad phology. The tis sue of origin of these rat cells was not obvious on mor\u00ad phological grounds although it might be assumed that they arose from stroma. A few cells were seen with the tetraploid number (138) of chromosomes. Although the chromosome number of the typically human chromo\u00ad somes is still 69 as in Toolan's laboratory, the range is much wider, from 53 to 75 (Figures 94 and 95). A few cells were seen carrying 35 chromosomes . 246 20 ---.---,,---.----.----r--------- 0: \"' CD :( :> I z 10 -' -' \"' u 0 60 80 CHROMOSOME NUMBER Figure 95 Chromosome modal number distribution of hu\u00ad man tumor H.

H .Ad .1 Tumor This tumor was obtained from Dr. Toolan in 1958, and has been maintained in our laboratory (H.B.H.) as H.Ad.l (Haley)/8) its chromosomes were studied in 1960. The tumor was again received from Toolan in 1961 and is being main\u00ad tained as H.Ad.l (Toolan) in our laboratory (H.B.H.). Idiograms of these two lines of H.Ad.l are shown in Figure 96. Of 48 meta\u00ad phase cells counted in H .Ad. l (Haley), 37 had 46 chromosomes, l had 43, 5 had 44, 2 had 45, and l had 4 7 chromosomes. Two cells were seen with the tetraploid number of 92. Thus H.Ad.l (Haley) has a primary chromosome number of 46 with a small spread around that number. H.Ad.l (Toolan}. on the other hand, has a primary chromosome number of 45 with a few at 43, 44, 46, 47, and 92; 107 metaphase cells were scored. Figure 97 is a karyotype typical of these cells with 45 chromosomes. The missing chromosome is a small acrocentric, presumably from pair 21. One of the X chromosomes is seen to be elongated, suggesting that this is a translocation of a 21 onto an X chromosome. Figure 98 is an idiogram typical of cells with 44 chromo\u00ad somes. The missing ones are 21 and an X chromosome. H.Ad.l (Toolan) seems to have transplantation characteristics dif\u00ad fering somewhat from those of H.Ad.l (Haley). The percentage of tumor ''takes 11 is lower and growth is not as good. It must be emphasized again that we are carrying the two strains of H.Ad.l in Wistar rats from differ\u00ad ent sources. The two strains of Wistar rats behave differently in cages and when handled, indicating that these two Wistar strains are no longer identical. Presumably, differences in host defense mechanisms could also be present. Discussion The chromosome karyotypes of two strains of tumor H.Ep.3 which have been maintained separately for more than 45 transplant generations are compared with those reported for the same tumor by Levan in 1956, (5) and the chromosome patterns of all three are remarkably similar. The stability of chromosome pattern in this tumor for over five years would appear to be established and to be significant. The stability of the satel\u00ad lites on the chromosomes has also been demonstrated. While Levan felt that these were distinctive, (5) more recent studies suggest that they are found normally on specific human chromosomes .(lO,ll) Interpretation of our findings with tumor H.Ad.l is less simple. Chromosome differences have been demonstrated, but direct correlation 247 of these with transplantation behavior is not yet possible. The general con\u00ad sistency of chromosome karyotype through many animal passages, as shown with H.Ep.3, was also shown in 1961 in the H.Ad.l strain received by us in 1958 (H.Ad.l Haley) and carried by Dr. Toolan prior to and since that time. The changes found in the more recently received strain are definite. The primary chromosome number of 45 in this strain (H.Ad.l Toolan) appears established. It has been recently shown (10-12) that the nucleolus-organizing, acrocentric chromosomes of man (pairs number 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22) are particularly susceptible to development of abnormalities. Translocation mongolism and the Ph' chromosome of chronic myeloid leukemia represent types of translocations within the acrocentric chromosomes, particularly chromosome 2l.(l0) Our strain H.Ad. l (Toolan) shows the absence of a small acrocentric chromosome (chromosome 21 or 22); one of the 248 1 4 7 13 c r 19 2 5 8 14 15 20 21 9 -3 6 10 11 12 16 17 18 ,, 22 X Figure 97.

All tumors examined showed a small number of cells with tetra\u00ad ploid chromosomes. Several preparations contained not only cells with human chromosomes but others with 42 typical rat chromosomes. A few human cells also had 42 chromosomes. Differentiation between the two was made by karyotype identification. Cells with 35 chromosomes were frequently found in metaphase spreads from various tumors; idiograms did not define their type, so these remain as unexplained phenomena. References 1. Toolan, H. W.
