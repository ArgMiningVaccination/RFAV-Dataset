When I was a young man and proud of my high pain threshold, I survived a few serious accidents, including a broken back and broken neck. I never went for medical work on either of the incidents and was temporally healed. Later in life, I began to have muscle spasms that were so bad, I had to be carried to the hospital in an ambulance. After a shot of muscle relaxant, I would walk out of the hospital as if nothing had ever happened. One day I grew tired of the constant pain and was referred to a woman who was a chiropractor and spiritual healer. Ruby Commandeur became a friend who helped me through my pain and taught me much about a positive attitude and love of life. Ruby was a mentor for healing and life; she loved yoga and talked me into trying it for relaxation as well as meditation. We lost Ruby to her pain, and I continue with my life inspired by the memories of this lovely lady. In the cultural ways of my ancestors, there is a time after the loss of a loved one where we put grieving aside to celebrate life. This is the time to let Ruby go and celebrate her, so I do this in BALANCE. Many thanks to Marnie Recker for the photograph that inspired this creation and to Jennifer Steven who knew it should be.
