[ Read More ](#/staff_member/7/bio) Anne Carruth LAc, Dipl OM, MS I'm a Midwest gal who followed my career, family, and love of the outdoors from Ohio, to Colorado, and finally to Oregon. I made my home in Portland in 2010, and am grateful to feel wholly supported here in both my personal and professional lives. My love of Chinese Medicine is founded on its holistic view of the mind, body, and spirit and emphasis on preventative care. I embrace the traditional Chinese model of treating the \"branch\" and the \"root\"; thus treating one's symptoms, as well as their underlying cause. This approach enables me to treat a wide variety of health concerns, ranging from acute pain to the common cold. I'm particularly passionate about pain relief. As an exercise junkie and outdoor enthusiast, I've had my fair share of injuries. I have extensive training in sports medicine acupuncture and orthopedics, and am continually refining my physical trauma and pain management therapies. I take great pleasure in guiding others out of both acute and chronic pain. Whether your pain is the result of an auto accident, a sports injury, cancer-related, from overuse, or a complete mystery, I love working through the body's complexities and getting to the root of a problem. In addition to pain management, I have a special interest in stress-related disorders. I place great emphasis on detoxification, dietary recommendations, and lifestyle adjustments when treating anxiety, depression, insomnia, fatigue, TMJ, hormone imbalances, IBS, and other complaints impacted by stress. By addressing both the mind and body I have found success where conventional medicine has fallen short. I devote a large part of my practice to MicroNeedling and Cosmetic Acupuncture. In our aesthetic-driven society, these modalities have allowed me to balance how one looks with how one feels. MicroNeedling ad NanoNeedling are collagen induction therapies, used to treat fine lines, wrinkles, acne, rosacea, scarring and more. Find out more about these services on my website. https://www.annecarruth.com/cosmeticacupuncture Facial Rejuvenation Acupuncture is a specialized protocol designed to increase Qi flow, blood perfusion, collagen production, and vitality in the skin. The result is a healthier, more youthful complexion. This 10 treatment series revitalizes the face and neck, while the 12-15 treatment Abdominal Protocol tightens loose skin, reduces abdominal fat, and helps to regulate digestion, hormones, and metabolism. I love my work as an acupuncturist and feel privileged to help others achieve their wellness goals. My gentle needling techniques and compassionate approach make me an ideal practitioner for sensitive patients and those new to acupuncture. While my extensive training and clinical experience enable me to tackle the most difficult of cases. Education I received my undergraduate degree in Zoology from Miami University of Ohio, as part of their pre-med/pre-vet program. I then swapped out the Midwest for the sunny Rocky Mountains, where I earned my master's in Traditional Chinese Medicine in Denver at the Colorado School of Traditional Chinese Medicine. In addition to my licensing through the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM) and the Oregon State Medical Board, I have completed extensive training in sports medicine acupuncture, cosmetic acupuncture, and oncology support. Insurance Billing Anne bills both In-Network and Out-of-Network insurance policies. She is currently In-Network with Axis, First Choice, Lifewise, Multiplan, Pacific Source, MODA (except MODA Synergy), Regence, United Healthcare, Providence, and Blue Cross Blue Shield.

Patient Testimonials \"I was referred to Anne for acupuncture sessions as part of my naturopath's treatment plan for me. I never had acupuncture before, I was fearful and wary, and my health was in a very weakened state. From my very first interaction with Anne, I felt safe, calm, and hopeful that my health would improve. Anne's positive energy, extensive knowledge and experience and dedication to helping her patients put my mind at ease and my body on the fast track to healing. I feel extraordinarily grateful and blessed that she has come into my life. She is a true healer.\" -Debra P. \"I came to Anne for support in my cancer treatment. She had many ideas and therapies that went beyond just needles. I was thoroughly impressed with the results as well as the time she took to understand my problems at the beginning of each session. I have the highest praise for her work!\" - Bryon G. \"At 50, I found myself with a group of chronic conditions brought about by time, family genetics, accidents and lifestyle. Anne found effective ways to reverse some of my conditions...I'm getting better. Underneath it all, the insights brought about by Western doctors' diagnostics have been gracefully integrated into the formation of treatment plans. With the balance Anne brings through acupuncture treatment, council and herbal remedies, things are looking up. I'm finding ways to eat better and to stay with my exercise plans. Thanks Anne for all your help! \" -Sam C. \" For the past few years I have been working through several concurrent chronic health issues. I have elected to go about these issues in a natural way and was referred to Anne by my healthcare practitioner. I had only done acupuncture once or twice in the past and didn't notice any significant changes, but after working with Anne I can personally attest to the amazing results that acupuncture can produce. When I work with Anne, I can feel energy moving and the symptoms we are targeting change during the session and these changes continue after the session as well. One big challenge I have been tackling is detoxification and Anne has seen me on some rough days and has helped to get things moving so that I begin to feel better. Anne puts the pieces of your health together to make a holistic treatment plan that will make anyone a believer in acupuncture if you just give it a try. She is also incredibly caring and invested in your health, which is what I value and look for in any practitioner. I would highly recommend Anne to anyone who needs some extra support with their health. \" -Jillie J. \"I was nervous about trying acupuncture because the idea of needles seemed a bit intimidating. But I was suffering from tendonitis and eager to try something that wouldn't involve more ibuprofen or other drugs. Anne has a very gentle touch, and I've always felt relaxed during my treatments. She also has a great bedside manner. She asks about my symptoms, listens to what's going on in my life, and makes appropriate suggestions. I highly recommend Anne to anyone looking for an acupuncturist.\" -Maria M. \"Anne is a compassionate and empathetic healer. After a session with her, I always feel more balanced & energized. Her care is an important contribution to my wellness.\" -Steve G. I'm a Midwest gal who followed my career, family, and love of the outdoors from Ohio, to Colorado...

She saw acupuncture support her family's health in various ways; from facilitating post-surgical recovery to healing a tennis elbow injury so thoroughly the scheduled surgery was no longer needed. Her childhood next door neighbor, a retired acupuncturist, was her first mentor. These early experiences inspired Liz to choose acupuncture when deciding on a career in healthcare. Once Liz began her formal acupuncture training, she received regular treatment and Chinese herbs herself. She experienced firsthand, and now sees through her patients, the profound possibilities for Chinese Medicine to heal, balance, and support the body and mind. Liz graduated from the Oregon College of Oriental Medicine in Portland and then completed her Doctorate from the Pacific College of Health Sciences. She had the unique opportunity to participate in a woman's health acupuncture residency and work directly with patients referred by Oregon Reproductive Medicine. In addition to supporting women's health, Liz enjoys treating all aspects of patient health, including pain, neuropathy, concussions, and other conditions. In her free time Liz loves taking her two dogs Arlo (shepherd mix) and Woodruff (chihuahua mix) on small and medium sized adventures.

Through 2019, almost the entirety of my massage career has been as Owner and Clinical Director of Psoas Massage + Bodywork, San Francisco's Premiere Sports and Therapeutic Bodywork Clinic from 2003-2019. At that location and time, I provided massage and bodywork treatment for an extremely diverse clientele including the very most difficult clients seen at the clinic, created and ran a training program for elite therapists in the area, and mentored entire therapeutic staff. Philosophy I am in awe of the human body and how it works, how we can increase athletic output, how it can be trained to be strong or flexible, or both, and how it heals and keeps from breaking down. How both relaxation and exertion effects it. I have mad respect for the puzzle pieces-bones, muscles, ligaments, tendons, fascia, nerve, the nervous system, organs, along with bodywork, stretching, understanding, exercise, rest, food, mental and emotional stability. They all amaze me continuously. I am grateful that I can use my knowledge and experience of these puzzle pieces to help you achieve and maintain health or reach your movement and athletic goals. Modalities Most sessions include multiple modalities which may include: Deep Tissue Myofascial Release ART (Active Release Techniques) Trigger Point Structural Sports Massage Movement specialist Taping AIS (Active Isolated Stretching) PNF (Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation) SFMA (Selective Functional Movement Assessment) What A Session Looks Like A session with Scott can be many things. Please wear or bring shorts, leggings, sports bra-sessions are often active. You always have the final say on all session plans. If you want 60 minutes on your feet, that's what you get. However, most people want my help in designing a session, a treatment plan or maintenance plan that will best aid in reaching their goals. A session with Scott could be on the table, a chair, the floor, all and more. It could be doing bodywork, designing an at home stretching program or learning corrective exercises that will reestablish functional movements. Scott's sessions often include education and homework, if wanted. Treatment Specialties While I do see clients for one off deep tissue sessions, my clients mostly fall into three distinct groups: treatment, maintenance, and athletic enhancement. Treatment - I work with a wide variety of ailments, including: Sciatic issues Acute and Chronic low back pain Plantar Fasciitis and Frozen shoulder Sprains, strains and tendonitis Tennis and Golfer's elbow All types of pain, discomfort, ache Peripheral nerve entrapment (numbness in hands, arms, legs and feet) Range of motion issues Maintenance - most clients continue getting maintenance work with me after treatment has concluded. I believe that getting regular maintenance work will allow most people to do the things they love and be more active with less pain and discomfort for longer into their lives. Athletic pains from training and competing Increased flexibility Maintaining flexibility Maintaining health Sports Massage/Athletic Enhancement - I take an active interest with my sports clients whether you are a professional or Olympic athlete, a weekend warrior or you just want to be able to hike on the weekends or play golf or tennis into your 80's and 90's Recover from training and competition quickly Develop functional movement patterns and increase flexibility and stability Enhance athletic output Increase Range of Motion Design personalized stretching programs Access hidden power I'm Scott and have been a professional body-worker since 2002 but my love for the human body bega...

She is passionate about offering health & wellness education about how nutrition, healthy diet and lifestyle changes can influence health, disease, longevity and genetic potential. She offers evidence-based natural treatment options to conventional medical treatment like pharmaceuticals and surgery. The goal of treatment should always be to offer the least invasive and most therapeutically-effective plan to fit the needs of each patient. You can expect to receive a comprehensive patient-specific treatment plan that includes questions about your health history, an examination (appropriate to the health complaint), possible laboratory (bloodwork) tests, imaging studies when necessary, and coordination of care with any other health practitioners from whom you may be receiving medical treatment. Treatment plans will include recommendations for your acute or chronic health problem, as well as how to prevent relapse of symptoms or risk for future health problems. This is where Naturopathic medicine excels as a preventative tool for chronic or recurring disease. Inflammation is an underlying trigger to most acute or chronic diseases. If you are experiencing flare-ups of pain or progressive systemic illness, inflammation is usually at the center of the problem. While this seems a simplistic approach, it can be very effective to reduce pain and symptoms. Diet and specific nutritional therapies are used to achieve this goal and get you feeling better, with improved energy and sense of well-being. When appropriate, Dr. Karin Volkoff may choose to prescribe a pharmaceutical medication along with your treatment plan if it is deemed necessary to meet your health goals. Changes in laboratory tests or imaging studies are used to follow how the treatment plans are influencing & benefiting physiologic changes in the body to reach your health potential. Some of the more common health conditions that Dr. Karin Volkoff treats include thyroid complaints, fatigue, anemia, digestive problems, irritable bowel symptoms, heartburn/reflux, cholesterol problems, blood pressure, headaches, migraines, female hormone problems, PMS, menopause symptoms, neck & back pain, nerve pain in arms/legs/feet, sciatica, and certain autoimmune illnesses. You are welcome to a free 15-minute phone consultation to ask about your specific health concerns. Please bring any current laboratory & imaging reports to your first visit to help facilitate our treatment plan together. EDUCATION Dr. Karin Volkoff received her doctorate in Naturopathic medicine at NCNM (now NUNM) in 2001. Her undergraduate degree at Oregon State University was completed in Biology and Pre-Medicine (1994). Naturopathic Doctors (NDs) complete a 4-year post-graduate education that includes an educational process similar to a conventional Medical doctor in certain aspects.

NDs are required to graduate from an accredited 4-year graduate medical program and pass rigorous state licensing exams to be allowed the privilege & responsibility to practice medicine in the state of Oregon. Extensive continuing education is required annually to maintain an active Oregon license and stay current on changes in medicine and pharmacology. Naturopaths share similar courses to MDs the first 2 years of medical school-courses include the basic & clinical sciences like anatomy, human physiology, biochemistry, embryology, pathology, pharmacology, clinical physical diagnosis and laboratory diagnosis. The following 2 years of education include numerous natural therapies and clinical experience that will offer you the best care and alternative options so that you can make informed decisions about your health care.
