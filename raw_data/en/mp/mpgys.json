Using a one-month detox structure, spiritual wellness expert and certified nutritional counselor Laura Harris Smith uncovers 30 universal faith-toxins that affect us all. Each day you will discover Scripture, prayers, and faith declarations to cleanse yourself spiritually and emotionally with truth and a biblical perspective. In addition, she includes a simple, corresponding nutritional cleanse using detoxifying foods from your own kitchen. Prayer by prayer, thought by thought, day by day, refresh and refuel your faith and bring healing to the whole temple--spirit, mind, and body. My first impression of this book was, \"There's no way I could do this; it's much too complicated,\" but then I started reading it and what it said made sense. Since my body could definitely use a reset, I decided to give it a try. I came away from this detox with several benefits: Though I'm not a tea drinker, I liked the detox tea (although I could only find it online.) The baths with Epsom salts were also beneficial and I did start sleeping longer at night (though unfortunately no increase in energy levels.) In fact, despite 23 days of faithfully following this eating plan, increased sleep was the only benefit I noticed. Every other day there was a new breakfast smoothie recipe, so there was plenty of variety. I can now say I've had smoothies with raw eggs and kale in them, not that I would ever put either of those in a smoothie again. There were 4 recipes I would make again, and it's good to know how to make a smoothie without using a mix for the base. My only issue with the breakfast smoothies is their inconsistency in size. A few were primarily just grapes, which doesn't get me to lunch. Others were so large I didn't need lunch. I had a hard time with the lunches and dinners. There was an abundance of food, more than I could possibly eat, but it became so difficult to know what to fix that it led me to end the detox a week early. Some sections had more vegetables and fruits to work with than others, but I always found it difficult to find 5 or 6 that went together to make the salad, soup or stir fry for lunch. I thought dinner was even more difficult, with each night just instructing to choose two fruits or vegetables. Specific recipes for lunch and dinner would have made all the difference. [Note: This book was provided free of charge by Chosen Books in exchange for an honest review.] It is difficult to take this book seriously, the way that the author seems to feel that no matter what she is talking about, whether bad poetry or overhyped recipes on some kind of fad color diet, or her misguided thoughts on the nature of the problem that afflicted Paul or her own quirky interpretations of the health and prosperity gospel, all of which are ridiculous, or the way that she goes more than 40 pages into the book before she quotes scripture at all and feels comfortable making taking the scripture out of context and making it a mere pretext for her teachings. Given the fact that this book consists of so many laughably bad elements thrown together, where the best part is probably the short recipe book in the back, which takes advantage of certain chemicals to affect body systems (like the supposed effect of coffee beans on the endocrine system to hype up one's adrenal glands with an overload of caffeine, among the most troublesome). That is not even to get into her awkward prayers, such as the following: \"Lord, I want to be \"unstuck.\" I want to go somewhere new! I receive what You have for me. All of it! Heal me of the feelings of failure, embarrassment, jealousy, despair and anger I sometimes battle. You are my Provider! You have established specific plans to use and prosper me! I trust you to take me somewhere, God. Here we go! In Jesus' name, Amen (115).\" Much of this author's embarrassment would be alleviated if she did not beclown herself by writing embarrassing books like this one, which reads like the cross of a part-time preacher who likes to meddle too much and has a poor theological background that blames people for their misfortune and trouble while simultaneously preaching a faddish version of the color diet that condemns the eating of food that God commands to be received with thanks, while promoting the idea that mangoes are somehow good for kidney health, among many other weird theories. In terms of its structure and contents, this book comes in at slightly over 250 pages total, including about a dozen pages of somewhat simple smoothie recipes. Sadly, the smoothies are probably the best part of the book, even with their silly names and dubious health benefits. The book opens with a dubious metaphor comparing physics to health, and comparing the nonexistent Trinity of the godhead to the supposed tripartite division of mankind into mind, body, and spirit. The second section of the book prepares the reader to be amazed at the haphazard and scattered nature of this book, which seems to assume that the reader hates vegetables and responds accordingly. The next five sections deal with a six-day (why not a full seven-day week, to make it more biblical?) set of dietary prescriptions that encourage the reader to get rid of social influence toxins, financial toxins, health-related toxins, relationship toxins, and purpose and identity toxins. During the course of these thirty days the author discusses everything from tithing to soul ties to a supposed war on wellness [1] to the author's love language [2]. According to the author, her biggest language of love is words of affirmation, which means she probably doesn't want to read this review, and this discussion leads her to speculate erroneously on why women stay with abusive husbands. After this comes a brief chapter for day 31 and the recipes, but this book is a trainwreck long before it reaches its conclusion. Mercifully, the book does not take very long to read, which is almost the only positive thing that can be said for many of its contents. In reading a book like this, one is tempted to view it as a parody of the ramblings of a charismatic Pentecostal who somehow thinks herself to be an expert on health and the scriptures when she lacks the kind of knowledge to be an expert on anything. This book manages to be spectacularly bad in an unpredictable way, as one does not know what is coming next, aside from the particular patterned organization in every chapter, in that the contents veer from bad exegesis to dubious social commentary to questionable health advice to awkward oversharing about her declining libido after having six kids, to any other number of topics that appear only tangentially related to the subject at hand. This is a book that could have used some strong editing presence to encourage the author to maintain coherence and avoid alienating and attacking her audience with sarcasm and nagging. The author simply lacks the credentials and the credibility to carry on in the fashion she does, to the point of indulging her verbal excesses to the extent that this book shows. One does not know whether to harshly critique this book for its many failures, or to pity the author for mistakenly thinking it is a good one that brings glory to God and credit to its author. When I received this book I didn't think carefully enough about what the book might entail. It is really quite an interesting concept and quite understandable that the mind and body can help heal or damage each another. The book talks about the healing results of prayer and the need for cleansing and caring for your physical body. I haven't yet followed the actual program outline in the book but I have been re-examining the concept of mind/body relationships. The books ideas are helping me reflect and refocus my spiritual thoughts. It makes sense to me that if good nutrition, and exercise have to be balanced. The concept that he mind will also be reflective of the care and attention that you give it and will effect your overall health. The book is well organized and easy to follow in concept. Putting any self help concept into practice is always an act of will and dedication. I appreciate the book and know that there will be a reader for whom this will be an amazing guide. I give it a 4 star rating. Let's face it. We all want to lose weight unless of course you were born with six pack abs and burn every calorie you take in on a daily basis. One thing is also certain. There are a plethora and I mean plethora of dieting fads, self-help books, infomercials with celebrities declaring that if you just eat this brand of meal you will look like them in a jiffy. Certainly some of those approaches might work and on the other hand, many will not or at least they will not have a lasting total body impact on your life. I have long thumbed my nose at such things for a variety of reasons, foremost being I recognized the faddish nature they were built upon. I recently became aware of a much different approach to health by watching a good friend of mine begin a 30 day journey towards better overall health - physical, mental, and spiritual health. After watching his results, I decided to embark on this journey myself. What journey is this you might ask? It is one that is found in Laura Harris Smith's book The 30-Day Faith Detox: Renew Your Mind, Cleanse Your Body, Heal Your Spirit. If you are concerned this is some new age approach to life or just another fad, let me ease your worries. Smith's approach is rooted in sound biblical teaching, lasting nutritional well-being, and with a distinct focus on not just being some 30 day \"thing\" you do and then return to your previous negative eating, spiritual, and emotional habits. Smith's desire is to show the reader how to make a change, a lasting impactful change towards total body health. She does this by providing a daily regimen of food choices and devotions that address specific parts of your body and your spiritual health. If you are worried that you will be eating cardboard tasting foods for 30 days (believe me I was worried about that), rest assured that the food choices and meal plans, while definitely healthy, are absolutely delicious. Who knew that a simple meal consisting of colorful vegetables and brown rice would be something you looked forward to eating. Tasty smoothies to kick off your day are followed by a variety of juicing options, healthy snacks, soups and salads, and the aforementioned colorful array of fruits and vegetables with rice, quinoa, or other options constitutes each day's meal plan. Smith steadily adds different colors of fruits and vegetables along the way resulting in a rainbow of colors and flavors to choose from as you begin to conclude your 30 day journey. The devotions she provides are valuable in that they are designed to rid your emotional, spiritual, and even relational life of the toxins that build up over time. Hence this is a full body approach to health. It is one thing to have a toned stomach and to have lost some weight. But if you continue to carry toxins in other parts of your life, those toxins will have an impact on your physical health as well. Smith addresses the full panoply of issues we all encounter such as doubt, issues with finances, and anger just to name a few. I believe what you will find after completing this journey is the desire to continue implementing the healthy food choices and life choices Smith guides you through in this book. It truly is a fun and exciting road to health that is much different from what you will encounter by just eating a Weight Watcher's dinner. Do this journey as a family. Invite some friends to join you. Share your successes and your failures on social media as a means of encouragement to keep you going. In the end, you will not just have found you have shed a few pounds and that some clothes you thought would never be worn again are now part of your weekly attire. You will also find more importantly that a positive change, a whole body change has taken place. That alone is worth embarking on this 30 day journey and besides, fitting into some long lost clothes isn't a bad deal either. To date by the way, I have lost around 6 pounds and counting so I can attest to fitting into some old clothes I thought I would never see again. I received this book for free from Chosen Books and the opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR, Part 255 : \"Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.\" Having read books on toxic faith in years past, I was excited to read this book. I was disappointed, however, that the title does not describe the contents of the book. This book is more about a physical body cleanse than it is about correcting toxic faith. Smith says of her book, \"This book is about assessing the current condition of your faith and being honest about it with yourself and God to ensure that your faith is in optimal health and ready to greet the greatness He has for you.\" (14) That statement is a clue the book is more about believing with a view to receiving than it is about doctrine. She writes, \"...faith is the science of three components: spirit, mind and body.\" (15) She argues that food and thoughts are connected. If what you eat affects what you think and if what you think affects your faith, \"then it can be said that what you are eating is currently affecting your faith.\" (35) \"Detoxing and cleansing the stomach results in clearer thinking and sharper faith.\" (36) The book is not so much about correct belief as it is a physical cleanse of the body. Smith does address faith issues in each of the thirty day writings. These issues are usually ones of behavior or feelings, such as dealing with negative emotions from a church split, seeing Christian stars fall, being rejected by others, emotions after natural disasters, not tithing, not stepping out in faith, and getting rid of \"stuff.\" She also writes about dealing with toxic ideas coming in and recommends a media fast. She writes about breaking soul ties and about the spiritual toxin of not owning one's own home. Smith is full gospel and one of the toxins is unfulfilled (personal) prophecy. I felt Smith did not really address many issues of fundamental toxic belief. She doesn't deal with harmful concepts such as thinking we must work for God's love and acceptance. I thought the most interesting section was about the misinterpretation of Paul's thorn in the flesh. \"It is clear that the thorn in Paul's flesh was persecution.\" (161) I wish there had more of this type of instruction about our faith in God, how we view Him, etc. Early on Smith writes, \"Because physical detoxification might be the most challenging component of our thirty days together...\" (20) I think correcting toxic belief is many times harder than following prescribed smoothies or veggie and fruit mixtures. If you are looking for a book truly on correcting toxic faith (in the sense of belief), this may not be the book for you. If you are looking for a book dealing with a body cleanse written in a Christian context and from a charismatic and full gospel viewpoint, this would be a good one. I received a complimentary egalley of this book from the publisher for the purpose of an independent and honest review. The premise sounds good, \"Renew your mind, cleanse your body, heal your spirit\". With a devotional, physical detox, and recipe each day it does work as a daily encouragement during a 30 day detox. Unfortunately, I was unable to get into the recipes. I know that detoxes do take time and effort each day, and Smith reassures us that the foods are real foods found in most kitchens. But the majority of the recipes are smoothies and I just can't get into recipes with raw eggs or such time consuming liquid meals that would only be for myself, making me a short order cook for the rest of the family. It seems to me one of those things that looks good on paper but is hard to execute in daily life, at least for me. This book was given to me by Chosen books in exchange for my honest review.

I was really excited to receive this book in the mail for several reasons: I am trying to be healthier in my eating habits because I want to lose this weight and I feel like I need to jump-start my faith life again because I haven't been in God's word like I should be. Laura Harris Smith does a wonderful job of explaining why a detox is so important and how she has laid out the different sections of the book for your personal use. The recipes are very straightforward, but I will warn you--you have to have a good juicer to actually make most of them, which is not something I had planned on buying and chose not to buy. I was also taken aback by the amount of food I had to buy in order to actually create some of the recipes--not to mention some of the ingredients were items that I wasn't used to having in my pantry (dandelion root and milk thistle?). Detoxing is apparently not something you can do on a budget. At least in my opinion after reading this book. I did enjoy how Laura had the different types of detoxes sectioned off and included prayers for each day of the week while doing the detox. She incorporated stories from the Bible and how they handled each type of stress in life as well. Overall, it was a good book to read about how to handle different types of stress and foods to eat to help counteract it as well as prayers to help pray in asking God for healing. I received this book for free as part of the First-Reads giveaways in exchange for my honest opinion. Recommended by Julie McKay. Did the 30-Day Faith Detox over the month of July (half way done at the writing of this). Such a hard, impractical detox. Kept wasting food because the six days were up and it was time for the next color. Plus if you worked full time there is no way to do the juicing mid-morning. There are aspects I like about it (eating fruits & veggies) but that's about it. Healthy eating, detox teas, and purposeful nutrition are all the rage. There are books, websites, videos, programs, and groups for every nuance within the spectrum of taking care of yourself. What makes this book stand out are several things. 1. The information is presented in bite-sized chunks. After a two-chapter introduction walks you through the basic premise behind detoxification of your body's major systems, you start 30 short, easy-to-follow daily challenges. I have found other resources to be quite wordy and hard to understand, even though I have lots of experience in health care and probably know more about human anatomy and physiology than the average reader. I tend to get bogged down in the gorey details of exactly how certain nutrients work inside our bodies and what some common toxin does to each of my systems on the cellular level. Just give it to me straight and in everyday language, or you've lost me. The 30-Day Faith Detox is a straight shooter, getting right to the point and then moving into the daily challenges. 2. The premise of the book is a holistic approach to healthy living. The author explains early on how the connection between our minds, our bodies, and our spirits leads to poor health in one or more of these areas when they are not properly cared for. Each day begins with a spiritual toxin and the corresponding emotional toxins. After an explanation of common things that we know cause us harm but probably don't notice or think about normally, we are presented with the cleansing diet for that day and a short explanation of how it works in our bodies. So while you are working through what you've learned about yourself from that day's devotional section, your body is cleansing itself of built-up gunk. 3. The plan is easy to follow. Okay, let me clarify that. If you're not ready to deal with these spiritual topics--social influence, financial, health-related, relationship, and purpose/identity toxins--then you could hit some roadblocks to moving forward. However, the author is very direct and specific in exposing danger zones and how to move past them. And since you only get one issue per day, you have time to stew a bit on each topic before moving on the next day. 4. The recipes use ingredients you probably already have and can find in any regular grocery store. There's no need to find a specialty market or get online and order an array of products to carry out this cleanse. And when you finish the 30 days, you will have learned some new recipes and sustainable habits you can continue to use to equip your body for optimum health. I received an ARC of this book from the publisher in exchange for my honest review. Disclaimer: blogger review program, I received a paperback copy for free, in exchange for my honest feedback about the book. I am not compensated in anyway other then a free copy of the book. The 30-Day Faith Detox Renew Your Mind, Cleanse Your Body, Heal Your Spirit A review by Amanda Ripsam Excited when my copy of the 30 day faith detox book arrived in the mail because I love reading books that are about faith and healing the mind body spirit. Anything along the health and wellness self help topics section of the book store is where I usually find myself pulled towards. This book was right up my alley. I started reading the book right away I noticed the beautiful cover and easy to follow along guide from table of contents to details in chapters such as how to remove negative toxins from our mind body and spirit that effects our healing. Topics include spiritual topics--social influence, financial, health-related, relationship, and idenftity toxins in easy to understand language and not in doctor mumbo jumbo. I like the straight to the point over all message of the book. 30 days is all experts say is what is needed to remove bad habits and develop a new routine. I have read along and followed some of the prayers which were beautifully written and I loved how it combined Christianity as well as medical science into one topic that was easy to read. I have started the 30 day detox challenge and I have to say that I am loving the recipes and the topics used to explore the key factors that are getting in the way of my own spiritual healing. I went into this challenge because I have gasteroparies, a genetic disorder and I am struggling with trying to loose weight in a healthy way. I have to admit not all of my health issues will be healed by a faith guided mind set there are some things that prayer and such cant cure like a deleted chromozone but having a healthy mind set changes perspective and that's where this book comes in to help guide thoughts in the direction of positive thinking. I recommend this book to any of my friends who are looking for a faith book based on words of encouraging thoughts and there are Bible verses to encourage you through the detoxing process, then this is the book for you and give the book a 5 out of 5 star rating. The food we eat and the things we put into our minds are filled with things that bog down our systems. Science tells us that our brains play a huge part in our health. Studies have also shown a correlation between our faith and our overall health. The author has broken down each part of our health and given a thirty day detox to heal all of these areas. Each day has a section for spiritual toxins, emotional toxins, and physical toxins, and ends with a blessing. The recipes and ingredients are common to find, easy to make, and work with any diet. I enjoyed reading this book and learning about the different aspects behind the concept. While the thought of completely changing everything for 30 days is daunting, I liked the idea. The detox diet and all of the recipes are based on food colors so the user can customize the month to their tastes, while staying within the parameter of the diet. I didn't feel like the faith part was strong and there were several things that I felt were theologically off. Since I haven't tried the detox, I can't speak to that aspect, so check out some of the other reviews. But I can say that I probably won't try it because the faith part isn't as strong as I would like, several of the meal plans seemed off nutritionally to me, and the overall idea was too daunting. Overall, it was a fun book to read. The concept, if I tweaked it, is intriguing, but I won't be keeping the book. I received this book free of charge from Chosen in exchange for my honest review. I have always wanted to do some type of detox but was not sure what type to do. I am so glad that I got the opportunity to try this product, I love the fact that it was a faith detox was so awesome. I love that there are daily prayers, that incorporates organs in your body that you are flushing out within the 30 days. The book also has recipes that are easy to make because and the ingredients are in the everyday kitchen. I love the authors style of writing it was easy to follow and understand and the whole family can use the tips with in this book. \"I received this book for free for my honest opinion from Bakers Publishing Group Division of Chosen Books\" First off, I did not know this was primarily a food plan rather than a spiritual detox. Secondly, the food plan is extremely strict and she says up front if you cannot commit to do it fully, without fail, for 3o days to wait until such time as you can. Well...I started looking and between family functions, work functions, vacations and board meetings...this is never going to happen. Both the food plan and the religious insights were a little too hardcore for me. However, if you want to change your life...I imagine following this food plan strictly would do it. I found this book to be an incredible daily devotional that happened to have additional positive side effects for me as I engaged in its living foods menu. I lost some weight, but infinitely more important is that my mind became clearer as I focused more on God's will for my life...in all areas. The author's perspective was consistently grounded in scripture, and this well written 30-day program is sure to uplift anyone who dedicates themselves to it. May God bless all who give it a try. While I did find physical benefits from this and did not find as difficult as I thought, several times the devotions came off as arrogant and judgmental. I will likely try this again, but will use a "}
