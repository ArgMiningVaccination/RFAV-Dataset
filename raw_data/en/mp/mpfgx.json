These misconceptions about mRNA vaccines have recently spilled over into worries about whether their use in agricultural animals could expose people to components of the vaccine [within animal products](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2023/02/15/fact-check-false-claim-mrna-vaccines-food-supply/11218991002/) such as meat or milk. In fact, a number of states are drafting or considering legislation outlawing the use of mRNA vaccines in food animals or, at minimum, requiring their labeling on animal products in grocery stores. [Idaho introduced a bill](https://legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/2023/legislation/H0154/) that would make it a misdemeanor to administer any type of mRNA vaccine to any person or mammal, including COVID-19 vaccines. A [Missouri bill](https://www.house.mo.gov/Bill.aspx?bill=HB1169&year=2023&code=R) would have required the labeling of animal products derived from animals administered mRNA vaccines but failed to get out of committee. [Arizona](https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/56leg/1R/summary/H.HB2762_020823_LARA.DOCX.htm) and [Tennessee](https://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/BillInfo/Default.aspx?BillNumber=SB0099&GA=113) have also proposed labeling bills. [Several other](https://www.oklahomafarmreport.com/okfr/2023/04/21/mike-deering-corrects-false-accusations-of-cattle-industry-using-mrna-vaccines/) [state legislatures](https://www.texasagriculture.gov/News-Events/Article/7596/Commissioner-Miller-Statement-on-mRNA-Vaccines-in-Livestock) are discussing similar measures. Iowa State University Assistant Professor of Vet Microbiology and Preventive Medicine David Verhoeven is a [researcher who has been making vaccines](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yTZZQ3QAAAAJ&hl=en) for a number of years. He started studying mRNA vaccines before the pandemic started. His research on using [mRNA vaccines for cattle respiratory viruses](https://portal.nifa.usda.gov/web/crisprojectpages/1027610-novel-mrna-vaccine-technology-for-prevention-of-bovine-respiratory-syncytial-virus.html) has been referenced by social media users and anti-vaccine activists who say that using these vaccines in animals will endanger the health of people who eat them.
