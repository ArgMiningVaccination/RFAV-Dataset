I'm Dr. Lauren Hughes. I'm a pediatrician, breastfeeding medicine physician, and a toddler and twin mom. I'm also the owner of Kansas City's first pediatric direct primary care clinic, Bloom Pediatrics and Lactation.With the talk of a COVID-19 vaccine on the horizon, there has been a lot of discussion of vaccines in general. I'm going to do an educational series about the most common concerns with vaccines. I had originally planned to make all these posts separate, but that would take a very long time to get through and I have other things I want to talk about, like how to safely do Halloween! So here is all the rest. Aluminum First, why do we put it in vaccines? Aluminum is an adjuvant. This means it helps vaccines work better by allowing a more robust immune response while using fewer antigens (remember those from Monday?) It is present in the hep A, hep B, Dt, Hib, and pneumococcal vaccines. It is not present in live viral vaccines such as MMR, Varicella, or rotavirus. The concern is that aluminum is a neurotoxin, because it IS....in high concentrations. Aluminum is the third most abundant element on our planet (after oxygen and silicon). It is found in plants, soil, air and water. It is also found in all sorts of food related products such as cans, pots, pans, as well as food such as spinach, potatoes, and flour. Most adults ingest 7-9 mg per day. We all have some tiny amount of aluminum circulating in our body all the time. In the first 6 months of an infant's life, they will ingest about 7 mg from breastmilk if they're exclusively breastfed, 38 mg from formula if fed cow's milk formula, and 117 mg if fed a soy formula. For comparison, there is 4.4 mg TOTAL from vaccines in the first 6 months. So vaccines are definitely not the primary source for aluminum. We also can tell it's safe given the amount infants take in from eating alone! Formaldehyde This is in embalming fluid, so it seems wrong to put it in vaccines. But did you know we all have formaldehyde in our bodies since it is essential in our metabolism and synthesis of DNA. Why do we put it in vaccines? This is used as an inactivating ingredient, meaning it kills viruses or inactivates toxins. High concentrations CAN damage DNA and cause cancerous changes (primarily nasopharyngeal cancer). Fortunately, there are merely residual quantities in vaccines as it is significantly diluted. There is about 1.1 mg of formaldehyde naturally found in a 5 kg (11 pounds) infant. This is about 1500 times higher than they would be exposed to in a single vaccine! Also, formaldehyde is found in things like cauliflower and pears. A pear has 7 times the amount present in a vaccine! Fetal cell DNA Some vaccines such as varicella, rubella, Hep A, one version of the shingles vaccine, and one version of the rabies vaccine were originally made using fetal embryo fibroblast cells. These cells do not have stable DNA and are fragmented so they cannot create a whole protein to incorporate into the host DNA. This means these fetal cells cannot incorporate into a child's DNA when they receive the vaccine. These cells were obtained from elective terminations of two pregnancies in the 1960s and the same cells have been used since. No further cells have been collected. Why did this happen? Viruses need cells to grow and they grow better in the cells they infect (humans). Fetal cells are also different than our cells. They have not divided as many times as other cell types so they can be used longer. This is a huge concern with those who practice Catholicism, with valid reason. It goes against a fundamental part of the faith. In 2005, however, the Pontifical Academy for Life, including Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (who later became Pope Benedict XVI) said these vaccines were appropriate to receive as long as there was no other equivalent alternative (there is not currently), though they disagreed with the choice of production. Autism The concern with autism started in 1998 when Andrew Wakefield published an article in The Lancet stating he found a correlation between the MMR vaccine and autism. The article was retracted in 2010 and Andrew Wakefield lost his ability to practice as a physician due to the ethical issues related to this \"study.\" The \"study\" Andrew Wakefield conducted reeks of ethical and moral issues. He obtained blood samples from kids at his son's birthday party. He paid them each 5 pounds. He was quoted as saying, \"Two children fainted, one threw up over his mother,\" he told his laughing audience in the clip. \"People said to me, you can't do that\u2014children won't come back to your birthday parties. I said we live in a market economy; next year they'll want 10 pounds.\" In the \"study\", he stated that 8 of the 12 children had autism. 3 of those 8 children did not have a diagnosis of autism and 5 had pre-existing developmental concerns. The \"study\" was commissioned and funded for planned litigation, with most of the research participant's families becoming involved in the case. None of that information was disclosed to The Lancet, as it should have been because it is a massive conflict of interest. Andrew Wakefield was also trying to patent his own measles vaccine. If this isn't enough information, there have been multiple studies showing there is no link between vaccines and autism. There was a well controlled study in 1999 where 498 children with autism or autism like disorders had their charts examined. He found that children with autism had no difference in the age of diagnosis between those vaccinated before or after 18 months of age and those who were never vaccinated. There was also no developmental regression clustered in the months after vaccination. You can read about that study here: [https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(99)01239-8/fulltext](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(99)01239-8/fulltext) Another study looked at over half a million kids from 1991 - 1998. 82% of those children received the MMR vaccine and the risk of autism was the same in the vaccinated group as the unvaccinated group. There was no association found between the vaccine and development of autism. That study can be found here: [https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa021134](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa021134) How do we develop and monitor vaccines? If the vaccine appears promising in preclinical studies, the vaccine sponsor submits an application for an Investigational New Drug to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Law requires that the sponsor describe the manufacturing and testing processes, summarize the laboratory reports, and describe the proposed studies to evaluate the vaccine. As with therapeutic drugs, vaccine evaluation includes phase I through phase III testing. Phase I trials are intended to assess the safety of the candidate vaccine and to determine the type and extent of immune response that the vaccine provokes. Phase II testing involves several hundred volunteers, some of whom belong to groups at risk for acquiring the disease. These trials generally are randomized and controlled and usually include a placebo group or a standard licensed vaccine when a new vaccine for that disease is being tested. Phase III vaccine trials are designed to determine whether the vaccine will prevent the disease in question and to assess the vaccine's safety when administered to a large number of subjects. These studies often involve thousands or tens of thousands of participants, depending on the incidence of disease and the rates of adverse events to be detected. If these studies show the vaccine to be effective and safe, it is then licensed. After data has been published, the ACIP (Advisory Community on Immunization Practices) which has members of the AAP (American Academy of Pediatrics) and AAFP (American Academy of Family Physicians) meet to review information and make a recommendation. It is then submitted to the CDC director who approves it or does not. After a vaccine is released, it is continually monitored. The CDC and FDA established the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) which was created in 1990. It collects \"signals\" about possible adverse events with vaccines. A great example of how this works is when RotaShield was taken off the market in 1999. There is something called intussusception that occurs in infants at a rate of 1 in 2000-3000 infants under the age of 1 normally. When RotaShield was introduced, approximately 1.8 million doses were given before it was pulled from the market. Why was it pulled? Because 15 infants (with a median age of 3 months) had intussusception reported to VAERS. 12 had it within 1 week of getting the RotaShield vaccine. This increase was enough to determine it to be unsafe and thus was pulled from the market. I hope this information provides some reassurance about vaccines! Please discuss any specific concerns you have with your child's pediatrician.
