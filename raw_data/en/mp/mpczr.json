Our family of chiropractic doctors have years of training and experience in helping patients get the relief they need to return to normal activity. Our hands-on chiropractic therapy brings your spine and musculoskeletal structure into proper alignment, restoring mobility to muscles and joints restricted by tissue injury or repetitive stress. Our North Portland chiropractic clinic also treats sciatica, scoliosis and other conditions involving extremities, including shoulder, jaw, wrist, hip, knee, ankle and foot problems, and can even help prevent injuries. What is a chiropractic adjustment? A chiropractic adjustment involves a manual manipulation of your spine and all extremities to reduce pain and restore joint function. Manipulations return mobility to joints restricted either by tissue injury caused by a traumatic event, such as a car accident, or repetitive stress from work or sports activities. While spinal adjustments are the most common chiropractic therapy, PURE LIFE CLINIC practitioners also utilize other techniques in their treatment plans: TMJ Release The chiropractor massages the inside of the jaw to release tension in the muscles. Frequency Specific Microcurrent The chiropractor introduces a mild electrical current to damaged soft tissue to treat nerve and muscle pain, increasing cell turnover to enhance healing. Many professional athletes accelerate their recovery using this technique. Cranial Work This technique reduces stress in the head and spine and improves the flow of spinal fluid, improving central nervous system function and providing relief for headaches and migraines. Ultrasound The chiropractor uses ultrasound waves to penetrate deep into muscles, reducing inflammation, improving blood flow and range of motion, and decreasing pain and stiffness in affected areas. Myofascial Release The chiropractor uses manual manipulation to release adhesions within the fascia, which is the thin connective tissue that runs throughout the body, enclosing muscles from head to toe. Kinesiotaping This technique provides support and stability to joints and muscles without affecting range of motion, decreasing inflammation and swelling while promoting better circulation of blood and lymphatic fluid. Electric Muscle Stimulation This technique uses light electrical pulses to cause fast contraction of muscles, reducing inflammation and muscle spasms. Exercise Therapy The chiropractor teaches you specific exercises that help strengthen and correct irregularities in your body that cause pain. Flexion Distraction Therapy Using a specially designed motorized table, the chiropractor applies mild traction with flexion in a gentle rhythmic motion to draw the disc material back into the spine. This therapy is effective to treat herniated discs non-surgically. Instrument-Assisted Soft Tissue Massage This technique is an instrument-assisted form of soft tissue mobilization that allows the doctor to penetrate deeper into the tissue than manual massage can offer. Dr. Brown was INCREDIBLY helpful when I came in with a neck injury and an ankle sprain. After spraining my ankle over a month ago and feeling like I was getting nowhere with my healing process, Dr. Brown provided me with instant relief! He did a very thorough examination, listened to what I was saying, and thoroughly explained what was happening in my body. After hearing from a physical therapist (at a different clinic) that the pain I was feeling in my ankle didn't make sense for my injury, I felt so validated working with Dr. Brown. I am so thankful I found Dr. Brown in my frenzy to find help for my neck spasm!
