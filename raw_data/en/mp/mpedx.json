Like many world's fairs before it, Expo 67 was designed to mediate relations between peoples and things through its architecture. The origins of this work lay in the efforts of Daniel van Ginkel and Blanche Lemco van Ginkel, architects and town planners who, in remarkable reports, drawings, and architectural ideals advanced between 1962 and 1963, outlined the basis of a fundamentally new, though never fully realised, world's fair in the late twentieth century. Party to the Congr\u00e8s Internationau x d'Architecture Moderne and its influential prewar edicts on functionalist town planning as well as to groups like Team 10 and their opposition to diagrammatic generalisations by an emphas is on the p ersonal, the particular, and the precise , the van Ginkels also drew on contemporary theor ies and practice s of North American urban renewal when first conceiving Expo 67 as an instrument for redeveloping downtown Montreal . The resulting work, Man and the C ity, which officially secured the world's fair bid but remained unbuilt , carefully drew on the legacies of most great exhibitions , especially those of the nineteenth century , in order to conceive of sufficiently heroic structures making immanent novel form s of human interaction, social control, and the technical organisation of space. In 1967, this was to suggest a new world historical project - in a space existing for only six months but crowded with 50 million visitors - promoting senses of fraternal sel f-awareness through the unrelenting promise of progress. The resulting well -known Expo 67 theme, Man and His World , was a paean to contemporary humanism first used by the van Ginkels and their architect allies to reject the most enduring symbol s of world exhibitions: the nation -state and its emblematic architecture. They imagined new kinds of architecture that could somehow engender new senses of political consciousness (inspired by , for example, UNESCO or the celebrated Family of Man photography exhibition of 1955) outside nationalist chauvinism. This was a vision of late modernity : a transitional form of political subjectivity still clinging to the shared passions of the citizen (thus for the polis ) before being subsumed by mass culture - in other words , a moment during which nationalisms could still be channelled into alternative forms of political belonging free of narrow self -interest. The belief marked every aspect of the van Ginkels early plans and had half -lives in two consequential works: the theme pavilions Man the Producer and Habitat 67, which, with outward emphasi s on the aesthetics and technics of innovative structures (and mass production), were seen as fulfilling the ambitions of the megastructural movement in the 1960s. As such, theses architectures of late modernity reflected a markedly modernist conviction of long duration: on the one hand, an abiding faith in technological salvation and, on the other hand, the sense of some liberative social mass giving rise to a new citizen of the worl d. At the very same moment, this universalism was fraught with ambiguity: on the one hand, any abiding faith in techno - scientific salvation was shaken in the aftermath of global war and the terror of nuclear holocaust; on the other hand, assumed geopolitical ideals were being upended, however temporarily, by , say, decolonisation and resulting alternative global alignments (with effects on the very layout of a postwar world's fair). Expo 67, perhaps the most consequential twentieth -century world's fair in terms of the utopian hopes of modern architecture, was prey to these and related desires to reinvigorate the modern project of uniting instrumental reason, mass edification, and popular spectacle in a genuinely new public realm. It would irrevocably shape the ways in which Canada, as a host nation purposely celebrating its centennial in the ambit of a world's fair, confronted its collective sense of cultural representation and global belonging. i Table of Contents List of Illustrations iii Acknowledgements xi Introduction 1 Chapter 1: City 23 City Origins City, Redux Chapter 2: Theme 64 A Theme Borrowings December January Chapter 3: Plan 115 Theme, Redux Islands Plans Images Plans, Redux Chapter 4: Tetrahedra 191 X's and O's A System Triangles Geodesics Tetrahedra \"Dumb Authority\" Rust Chapter 5: Housing the World, 1 265 A Trip A Thesis Keywords Memoranda Man versus the City Urbanism ii Chapter 6: Housing the World, 2 330 Boxes Economies Exhib iting Construction Critique Systems Conclusion : A Nation 407 Bibliography 472 Illustrations 498 iii List of Illustrations Fig. 0.1 The heroic architecture of Expo 67 498 Fig. 0.2 Crowds at Expo 67 499 Fig. 0.3 Montreal transformed in the 1960s 500 Fig. 0.4 John Andrews, Scarborough College, Toronto, 1965 501 Fig. 0.5 The Expo 67 islands under construction 502 Fig. 0.6 Man the Producer 503 Fig. 0.7 Habitat 67 503 Fig. 1.1 \"Man in the City\" presentation model, 1962 504 Fig. 1.2 Daniel van Ginkel, et al. , \"Scales of Association\" diagram , January 1954 504 Fig. 1.3 CIAM, Otterlo, 1959 505 Fig. 1.4 Aldo van Eyck , \"The Story of another I dea\", Forum 7 (1959) 506 Fig. 1.5 The va n Ginkels at CIAM Otterlo, 1959 507 Fig. 1.6 Aldo van Eyck, Amsterdam Or phanage, 1959 508 Fig. 1.7 \"The Elevated Sidewalk\", Scientific American (July 26, 1913) 509 Fig. 1.8 Van Ginkel Associates, Central Area Circulation study, 1962 510 Fig. 1.9 Louis Kahn, \"Toward a Plan for Midtown Philadelphia\" (1953) 511 and \"Order in Architecture\" (1957) Fig. 1.10 Daniel van Ginkel, \"The City\" (January -February 1962) 512 Fig. 1.11 Alison and Peter Smithson, Berlin -Haupstadt project, 1958 513 Fig. 1.12 Marcel Breuer, Berlin Potsdamer P latz project, 1929 514 Fig. 1.13 City of Montrea l, Proposed Redevelopment of a Blighted Residential 515 iv Area and Construction of Low Rental Housing (1954) Fig. 1.14 Jean Drapeau's early urban dreams: Cit\u00e9 -Famille (1957) 515 Fig. 2.1 The Family of Man exhibition, Museum of Modern Art, New York 516 Fig. 2.2 The Family of Man exhibition catalogue (1955) 517 Fig. 2.3 Sigfried Giedion, Space, Time and Architecture (third edition, 1956) 518 Fig. 2.4 Laszlo Moholy -Nagy, jacket design for Sigfried Giedion's Building in 519 France, Building Iron, Building in Ferroconcrete (1928) Fig. 2.5 Louis Kahn, \"Monumentality\" ( 1949) 520 Fig. 2.6 Buckminster Fuller, geodesic dome for the Uni ted States Marine Corps 521 Fig. 2.7 Louis Kahn, Viaduct Architecture, 1962 522 Fig. 3.1 Expo 67 organisation flowchart, Apr il 1963 523 Fig. 3.2 Le Corbusier, \"The law of the meander\", Precisions (1930) 524 Fig. 3.3 Kenzo Tange, Tokyo Bay project, 1960 525 Fig. 3.4 Jean Drapeau presents his tower to the Montreal City Council, 1964 526 Fig. 3.5 The Expo islands, September 25, 1963 527 Fig. 3.6 Kenzo Tange, Tokyo Bay project, 1960;

The PhD programme in the Graduate School of Architecture of Architecture, Planning and Preservation at Columbia University was a wonderful place to discover new ideas and to make last ing friendships . I am grateful to the dissertation committee members for their enthusiasm and critique: Eric Mumford, for crucial academic work on which this project rests and an encouraging word in Brussels a couple of years ago; Felicity Scott, for a ri ch summation that finally allowed me to see the forest and not the trees; Mary McLeod, for very early intellectual support and now friendship; and Kenneth Frampton, for a generosity of spirit and sharing of ideas that have shaped my view on the historian's task. I am, above all, deeply indebted to my advisor, Reinhold Martin, for not only guiding this rambling work but offering an engaged and ethical model of scholarship and teaching: t hank you . This project advanced through the assistance of many librari es, institutions , and individuals . I owe thanks to key ones : Monsieur Gilles Lafontaine and the incredible staff at the Centre d' archives de Montr\u00e9al ; Rare Books and Special Collections, McGill University; xii Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library, Columb University; Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives nationales du Qu\u00e9bec; a nd especially Renata Guttman along with her past and current colleagues in Research Collections at the Canadi an Centre for Architecture . The dissertation started with a Collections Research Gr ant at the CCA, where the former director of its Study Centre, Alexis Sornin, created a delightful atmosphere for initiating ideas . Several architects responsible for designing Expo 67 kindly offered their recollections: Ad\u00e8le Naud\u00e9 Santos, Steven Staples , Thomas Williams, and Guntis Blanche and the late Daniel \"Sandy\" van Ginkel shared ideas and stories that are at the heart of this project. I will not forget a charming afternoon of reminiscenc es at their home in October 2008. Finally, this dissertation owes immeasurably to the staff at Library and Archives Canada, Ottawa, where the main Expo 67 archives are held. Given the current Conservative government's massive cuts to the LAC staff and bu dget, it is unclear whether I could actually initiate my project today. Writing this dissertation against the backdrop of a sustained dismantling of national cultural institutions and scientific research has been sobering. The best thing about a PhD is n ot just finishing but continuing friendships beyond it. I am lucky to have made great friends at Columbia : Cesare Birignani, Hyun -Tae Jung, Albert Narath, Bob Rubin, Enrique Walker, and Tao Zhu. Eunice Seng and Ralph Gh oche were the best classmates imaginable, and I am happy that we entered and finished in the very same year s. xiii The unwavering support of my family has made this and so many more things possible . My aunt, Surinder Kaur Mangat, is a cornerstone of my life in New York , New Jersey, and far beyo nd. None of this would have been possible without the love and understanding of my parents, Birinder Singh Riar and Amir Kaur Riar. It is simply an understatement to dedicate this work to them. Finally, Sonya Minhyung Lee has been a constant companion a nd source of joy throughout it all. I cannot wait to return all these library books and spend time together. 1 Introduction But Marlow was not typical (if his propensity to spin yarns be excepted), and to him the meaning of an episode was not inside like a kernel but outside, enveloping the tale which brought it out only as a glow brings out a haze, in the likeness of one of these misty halos that sometimes are made visible by the spectral illumination of moonshine. Joseph Conrad, Heart of Darkness (1902) If anything, then the 1967 Universal and International Exhibition, the Montreal world's fair commonly known as Expo 67, was a tale of many cities. A pair of artificial islands, dredged from the St Lawrence River, held fairgrounds as a mirror of modernisation to an existing city simultaneously facing urban renewal. In turn, the world's fair served as litmus of emerging theories on experiencing postwar space that were caught between praising and dismissing this temporary architecture as either a genuine public realm or a spectacular divertissement . In each instance Expo 67 was a project of reconciling ideal cities , real or imagined. Some had been long known in the consciousness of modernism. Others were only appearing in debates on what, exactly, constituted modern life after world war. A few were newly conceived as situating the unique aesthetic, cultural, and technological motivations of North American life. Here, the optimism of large -scale thinking in the 1960s imagined sufficiently heroic structures making immanent new forms of human interaction, social control, and the technical organisation of space (fig. 0.1). If this indicated an avant -garde undertaking, then it reminded just how art, including the building sciences, had, since the late eighteenth century, served the ongoing construction of a European -American subject - as citizen, as tastemaker - and corresponding notions on transforming the rest of the world. In this long march, the architecture of Expo 67 would, it was first hoped, do something utterly 2 antithetical to all world's fairs, thus to visions of modernity: oppose the consecration of the nation-state. The utopian suggestion was hardly accidental. Expo 67 was, after all, a place existing for only six months but crowded with 50 million visitors - conditions allowing, perhaps, for a more honest test of theory (fig. 0.2). The very fact that the exhibition was set on islands - and removed from any context - only emphasised the ideal framing of objects - pavilions - marking a new world historical project. World's fairs had established critical passages through global modernity since the nineteenth -century. Notwithstanding very real crises, including war, these long- planned but short- lived events promoted senses of fraternal self - awareness through the unrelenting promise of progress. The ecumenical practice and understanding of art, philosophy, science, and technology crystallised in the didactic function of architecture, which, in its most vanguard forms , introduced advanced technics seen as not only capturing a spirit of the age but quite literally housing a new mass public. This held significan ce for the liberal humanist worldview presumably guiding postwar architecture culture ( which Expo 67 served to exemplify ). Broadly speaking, world's fairs extended the Enlightenment project of instrumental reason and public edification - \"the world in a shilling\" the 1851 Great Exhibition had promised - as popular events. In the past, these ambitions were captured in any number of galeries des machines , vehicles of measuring human self -realisation by an awestruck awareness of a world mediated by technology. Yet in the aftermath of global war and the terror of nuclear holocaust, the destructive capacity of techno -science gave pause. The splitting of the atom signified both a terrifying power and a 3 thrilling source of energy . One promised total annihilati on; the other salvation. On one side stood a complete social and psychological alienation, as a product of fear, from the life world ; on the other side grew a total embrace of emerging technologies - communications, mass media, transportation - shaping pa cific visions of international ism and collective self - awareness. Be tween these poles was a compensatory mechanism of mid -century existentialism, phenomenology, or philosophical humanism seeking to build doctrines of authentic experience. Such currents coloured challenges to the modern movement in architecture, with , for example, the Congr\u00e8s Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM) and its influential prewar edicts on functionalist town planning yielding to groups like Team 10 that countered any diagrammatic generalisations by an emphasis on the personal, the particular, and the precise: as opposed to the rational ordering of space, it was to be the psychological need for it. In terms of some historical self -consciousness, this was not yet a fully postmodern moment marked by consumer culture or obsessive aesthetic formalism (or the consequent rejection of utopianism). Indeed, there remained a somewhat apocalyptic view on reforming, say, the city - the plan could, it was hoped, still organise spatial-fo rmal ideas with some corresponding political purpose. The modern ist paradigm was, however, passing through a transitional form of political subjectivity still clinging to the shared passions of the citizen (thus for the polis ) before being subsumed by mas s culture - in other words, a moment during which nationalisms (including those of recently decolonising countries) could still be channelled into alternative forms of political belonging free of 4 chauvinism or narrow self -interest.1 This late modern form of association still held out hope for linking impressions of nationhood to public life. The corresponding architecture was to be technologically sophisticated ( and possibly mass produced) while engender ing novel forms of social interaction . Expo 67 was , at its very start, conceived in these terms . It was the work of Daniel van Ginkel and Blanche Lemco van Ginkel, husband and wife, architects and town planners, contributors to CIAM but instigators of the emergence of Team 10 from it, and, crucially, the first v oices on what, exactly, a world's fair constituted in the late twentieth century . Based in Montreal, the van Ginkels were central to introducing the city's planning and bureaucratic elites to contemporary theories on urban renewal in the early 1960 s. Politicians and planners aspired to make Montreal a city of 5,000,000 million people by the year 2000 (a millenarian hope never fulfilled). The first appearance of glass and steel skyscrapers - notably I.M. Pei's Place Ville Marie completed in 1961 an d celebrated by Peter Blake, the influential editor of Architectural Forum , as giving rise to \"the first 20 th century city in North America\" with its links to what became known as Montreal's \"underground city\" - promised a belated experience of international style modernism (fig. 0.3). 2 The ambition was accompanied by the typical instruments of urban renewal - not only the infrastructures of a Metro system and an enormous network of autoroutes , both designed to coincide with the 1 Blake Stimson, The Pivot of the World: Photography and Its Nation (Cambridge MA: The MIT Press, 2006), 3, 7. 2 Peter Blake, \"Downtown in 3- D\", Architectural Forum (September 1966): 34. Place Ville Marie was undertaken by the pr ominent New York real estate developer William Zeckendorf, a pioneer of integrating of shops and services in high rise projects built at the scale of city blocks. 5 world's fair, but the creat ion of cultural acropolises, a key aspect of postwar CIAM doctrine on rediscovering the city \"core\" .3 Indeed, unlike the more dogmatic members of Team 10, the van Ginkels balanced a new CIAM search for \"The Heart of the City\", which aimed at creating the symbols of community within a still rationalistic framework, and the Team 10 desire for discover ing a primal language uniting form and meaning.4 These ideas and programmes, which raised questions on the relevance of monumental architecture to spaces of public appearance, were critical to the world's fair plans. As opposed to a short -lived spectacle, Expo 67 was, in its earliest guise, to usher long -lasting, epochal urban change. To encounter the legacy of CIAM - in Montreal, in the early 1960s - was to consider its continued relevance as a truly international agent of modern architecture and urbanism. Indeed, its prewar civilising mission - against insalubrity, for mass housing - had reappeared in attempts to lend the authority of specialists - architect s - to postwar reconstruction efforts. Yet the cultural revivification of CIAM was found elsewhere, in other forms of global communion and purchase. Dissatisfied with nation -state hegemony, the van Ginkels and associated architects discovered other kinds of internationalism, epitomised by the United Nations but especially UNESCO, as the basis of aesthetic, social, and political values. The ideal of one world -ness was to be approximated - that is, made architectural - in the world's fair: a master plan co uld, the architects believed, make visible geopolitical 3 J. Tyrwhitt, J.L. Sert, and E.N. Rogers, eds., The Heart of the City: Towards the Humanisa tion of Urban Life (London: Lund Humpheries, 1952). The book collected ideas on the urban \"core\" raised during the eighth CIAM congress in Hoddesdon, England, in July 1951. 4 Alan Colquhoun, Modern Architecture (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000), 218-219. 6 alignments outside cold war demarcations or distinctions between rich and poor countries . To reject the authority of the nation - and its architectural equivalent, the pavilion - was to intervene in the ways artefacts and ideologies were typically parsed, catalogued, and displayed at world exhibitions as global showcases. The resulting Expo 67 theme, Man and His World, was a paean to contemporary humanism. Borrowed from the French aviator -philosopher Antoine de Saint Exup\u00e9ry's book Terre des Hommes of 1939, the idea - first advanced by the van Ginkels' friend Claude Robillard, head of the Montreal Service d'Urbanism e, but officially ratified by the Montebello Conference of Canadian intellectuals charg ed with defin ing the world's fair in May 1963 - evoked , the architects insisted, \"man's possession of the world or active manipulation by man of natural forces and social structures.\"5 New humanist values could extend through a public spectacle seen as ma rrying science to poetry and culture to democracy.6 Thus, events and images like the famous 1955 Family of Man photography exhibition, admired by the architects for its fraternal spirit and repeatedly invoked as precedent, were to portend a postwar projec t of recuperation - that is, somehow to find in the Enlightenment project not its end but the possibilities of new beginnings. Even as it was couched in the operations of an expanding Canadian welfare state and government debt expenditure purposely aimed at creating a viable \"culture industry\", the van Ginkels' plan was little aligned to the dire warnings of a total rationalisation of life predicted by, among 5 \"Heigh Ho Come to the Fair/Exhibition\", The Canadian Architect (March 1963): 104. 6 Konstantin Kolenda, \"Humanism\", in Robert Audi, ed., The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy (Cambridge UK: Cambridge University Press, 1999, second edition), 396 -397. 7 others, Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer, who, in The Dialectic of Enlightenment of 1944, nervous ly anticipated a world of instrumental reason limiting subjective autonomy. Instead, the architects' mission was more akin to what J\u00fcrgen Habermas, heir to Frankfurt School critical theory, described (at the very moment of early prognostication on Expo 67 ) as a public sphere shaped by culture, thus serving as \"training ground for critical public reflection\" and opening up new ways of relating to the world.7 Though not translated into English until 1989, Habermas's book is symptomatic of late -modern effort s to shape a social imaginary freed from the limits of private interest and bureaucratised public authority.8 For the van Ginkels , this owed to a self -conscious synthesis of a range of precedents, first in early postwar regroupings of CIAM, then in challe nges to it by Team 10, and finally in new methods of urban design based on synaesthetic readings of the built environment (for example, the planner Kevin Lynch's book The Image of the City of 1960). None of these approaches were seen in opposition. Rather , as countless critical early reports - the work was carried far more in words than in drawings - made clear, the willful use of these theories, through liberal though unattributed borrowings, made abstract formal principles - \"patterns\" in Lynch's parlanc e - the basis of organising sequential experiences of \"interconnectedness\" across multiple levels and in many directions; in turn, different local-global connections were to be construed by visitors themselves and not via a determin ing 7 J\u00fcrgen Habermas, The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere: An Inquiry into a Category of Bourgeois Society (1962; Cambridge M A: The MIT Press, 1989), 29, 34 . The notion of world's fair as testing ground follows from Habermas's descripti on of the eighteenth -century salon as exercising the \"monopoly of first publication\" - that is, the space in which new works, including artistic ones, were raised and legitimated. 8 Stimson, The Pivot of the World: Photography and Its Nation , 19. 8 plan.9 As such, or so the theory went, people could explore new forms of political consciousness inside one sufficiently enormous structure . Man and His World was to convey the integration of creative expression and understanding in art, science, and technology as well as promote awareness of belonging to the \" community of man\" (eventually a subtheme of Expo 67) - a condition the Canadian media theorist Marshall McLuhan was calling the \"global village\".10 The tension in McLuhan's term, between Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft , between modernity and tradition, between mechanised life and the rootedness of culture s, offered the space in which Man and His World was hopefully to appear. The utopian gesture was not about arriving at a historical plateau, at a settled state of human affairs . Rather, it premised a constant revolutionising, by architecture, of the relations between peoples and things. Throughout 1963, the van Ginkels imagined the theme of \"man\" as parsed among any number of artistic, cultural, or geographic conditions existing outside geopolitics - for example, the Arctic, which they repeatedly upheld as a genuine multinational scape of scientific discovery. Indeed, their first architectural statement, Man and the Polar Regions - designed by a group of young architect s freshly minted from the urban design programme at Harvard, a source of both late-CIAM thought and new theories like Ly nch's \"imageability\" of cities - provided a blueprint of how they saw 9 Kevin Lynch, The Image of the City (Cambridge MA: The MIT Press, 1960). 10 Krista L. Bennett, \"Montreal 1967\", in John E. Findling and Kimberly D. Pelle, Encyclopedia of World's Fairs and Expositions (Jefferson NC: McFarland & Co, 2008), 337. McLuhan fir st described the \"global village\" in his books The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man (1962) and Understanding Media (1964). The van Ginkels did not necessarily advance their ideas in similarly breathless embraces of modern technology. 9 the world's fair functioning: a singularly massive architectural w ork in which countries c ould simply add their contributions - as buildings - to various themes, whether of artistic or scientific inquiry, thus allowing visitors to navigate global production by a comparative unfolding of human endeavour. This was to ensure one overriding demand: that the national pavilion would be eclipsed at Expo 67, relegated to an outmoded sense of history. The belief held that any number of things - whether cultural artefacts or machines - could be disentangled from national origins and brought together in a spirit of \"transhumanism\" (an idea the architects borrowed from the evolutionary biologist and first UNESCO Director Julian Huxley ). Modernity, witnessed in the aesthetic and technological achievement of, among other things, arch itecture, c ould be rehabilitated as long it was placed beyond the limits of upholding the nation -state. The sentiment was both tricky and timely. Expo 67 was, as a world's fair, the nationalist vehicle par excellence. In fact, it was specifically mean t to celebrate the centennial of Canadian Confederation in 1867. In this, it followed currents of postwar cultural modernisation. Much in the way that an event like the 1951 Festival of Britain and its architecture was , on the one hand, a Labour Party ef fort celebrating a (Scandinavian style) welfare state and, on the other hand, the presentiment of a sort of Tory futurism with policies of military -industrial growth and a consumer economy shaping a popular power diffused through a body of national (or eve n, at this time, Commonwealth) culture, Canadian ambitions for the centennial were , in terms of the Conservative government of the early 1960s, both reverently nationalist and therapeutic - that is, an official construction of 10 identity by the vehicle s of p ublic institutions and modern technology.11 The aspiration was tied to establishing levels of state patronage. The Royal Commission on National Development in the Arts, Letters and Sciences, commonly known as the Massey Commission, had, from 1949 to 1951, undertaken hearings in major cities on what, exactly, should be the role of government in shaping Canadian cultural life. The resulting recommendations irrevocably changed the country, with the creation arts institutions, funding programmes, and universi ties. The argument was, in a sense, levelled at mass culture. In places, this had translated as the fear, shrill and often unsubstantiated, of American hegemony over Canadian taste - making (whether in literature or television programming). It was also ex tended during a period in which global alliances were being readjusted: the eclipse of the British empire by the rise of Pax Americana shaped Canadian thought and life, not least in contributions to Cold War defence, notably the Distant Early Warning (DEW) Line, a system of radar stations stretching roughly along the 69th parallel in the far northern Arctic. The debate rested on whether Canada was a participant, even a leader, in global affairs. It crystallised in the \"Sixty days of decision\", a proclamation by the former diplomat and newly elected Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson in May 1963, when committing to full employment, reforming health care, introducing a public pension plan, aiming at the equal partnership of French and 11 David Mellor, \"A 'Glorious Techniculture' in Nineteen -Fifties Britain: The Many Cultural Contexts of the Independent Group\", in David Robbins, ed., The Independent Group: Postwar Britain and the Aesthetics of Plenty (Cambridge MA: The MIT Press, 1990), 229; L.B. Kuffert, A Great Duty: Canadian Responses to Modern Life and Mass Culture, 1939 -1967 (Montreal and Kingston: McGill- Queen's University Press, 2003), 217. 11 English in national life, and, notably, promising a national flag officially replacing the British Union Jack .12 The recipient of a Nobel Peace Prize, awarded for resolving the Suez Crisis through the United Nations (wh ich, along with NATO, he had done much to help found), Pearson had also campaigned on repudiating his opposition to atomic weapons and accepting that American missiles stationed on Canadian soil could be armed with nuclear warheads. In all this, he sought to define Canada as a \"middle power\" - a status to be exercised through institutions like the United Nations (namely peacekeeping but also the international coalition fighting the Korean War) that, with the fallout from Suez, gave opportunity to circumvent or at least to modify relations, sometimes perceived as neocolonial, to British authority (believed in relative decline) and American power (seen as inflexibly centred on \"domino theory\") without invoking anti-Americanism. Read through these national-in ternational debates, the Centennial celebrations were meant to endorse a unifying vision of Canada - not only to Canadians but to observers abroad, especially in terms of promoting the host nation as a model non -imperial power (an ambiguous status througho ut at least the 1950s, with Ottawa rarely criticising London on its foreign affairs). Indeed, to the architects first imagining Expo 67, decolonisation and its effects were to be promoted specifically because of an assumed resonance with postwar Canadian ideals. There was, here, a statement on architecture, culture, and nationhood. The reluctance for aspects of American power replaced earlier fears of ceding Canadian intellectual life to British influence. This held almost millenarian significance. Any perusal 12 The Canadian flag was first unfurled in 1965. It replaced both the British Union Jack and the Red Ensign. 12 of prewar issues of the Journal of the Royal Architecture Institute of Canada reveal ed a prevailing Neoclassicism that, by the 1930s, evolved into the moderne styling of Art Deco; at times, some Arts and Crafts or neo- Gothic tendencies emerged, whether in private, often palatial, homes (otherwise done up in a Scottish baronial style) or middle class housing developments . The aesthetic culture was resolutely British (with some concessions made to French taste). No mention was made of European modernism - or of things much closer to home : in Canada, there was no equivalent PSFS building, no community planning along the lines of the Radburn plan, no aesthetic project arising from monumental schemes like the Works Progress Administration, no effect of Frank Lloyd Wright.13 Symptomatic was the Canadian contribution to the 1937 Paris Exposition Universelle: unimaginatively rendered as a group of cylinders evoking grain silos, the pavilion could only lamely recall the original, robust works that had, inde ed, been championed by European modernist as gestalt entities for what Le Corbusier called the \"engineer's aesthetic\". 14 As Humphrey Carver, the \u00e9migr\u00e9 13 Among the four Canadian schools of architecture, McGill was the first to evince a modern sensibility , though only in the late 1930s (owing perhaps to students returning fueled by Bauhaus -thinking at Harvard). At the time, some Canadian arch itects were, indeed, modernists but without visible impact on their country: Hazen Sise, raised in privilege in Montreal, worked for Le Corbusier after having attended the 1933 CIAM meeting that produced The Athens Charter but was, by the mid -1930s, volunt eering in Norman Bethune's ambulance brigade sympathetic to the Republican cause during the Spanish Civil War; and the British Columbian Wells Coates, who was firmly ensconced in London and a founding member of the Modern Architectural Research Group, the British wing of CIAM. 14 Along with Le Corbusier (in Vers un architecture of 1923), other European architects - including, for example, Erich Mendelsohn (in Amerika: Bilderbuch eines Architekten of 1926) and Bruno Taut (in Modern Architecture of 1929) - had celebrated North American grain silos as a priori modern forms. The 1958 Brussels Exhibition witnessed the first truly modern ist Canadian world's fair pavilion; designed by Charles Greenberg, it brilliantly adapted the Miesian frame to the demands of te mporary erection and installation. Greenberg noted: \"The problem, then, of presenting a building at Brussels truly representative of Canada was a complicated one. It could have been skirted entirely by the very tempting 'exotic' solution, fully licentiou s architecturally, which produces a result beyond all national identification. A controlled solution more consonant with the Canadian temperament, integrating a diversification of skills, art forms and symbols, and employing a representative 13 British architect and leading community planner , recalled when anticipating urban trends in 1960: In bot h the U.S. and in Britain the foundation of present planning ideas and methods was laid down during the period between the two wars. In Canada this did not happen. For us the economic Depression of the Thirties was a vacuum and a complete break with the past. We had no Fredric Osbornes, Abercrombies and Clarence Steins. We had no public housing programs and none of the adventurous social experiments of the New Deal. In the Toynbee sense, we did not react to the challenge of the Depression - perhaps our roots were not yet deep enough. We withered on the stem. So in 1946 we almost literally started from scratch with no plan or planners and we immediately hit a period of tremendous city growth. 15 Indeed, the prewar hesitation underwent a swift and epochal transformation . Around 1943, the RAIC Journal , like similar concerns in Britain and America, began ponder ing postwar reconstruction. In Canada, this was not , of course, tied to rebuilding shattered cities but meant for the needs of a n urbanis ing nation. Canadian architectural circles suddenly began evoking the edicts of CIAM functionalist town planning , which were applied equally to existing cities and hinterland communities . 16 This became a fundamental part of a growing technology for a building of this size, was selected as being more likely to yield a nationally identifiable result\". In other words, Canadian -ness was identified with modernism by the 1950s. See: \"Canada Pavilion at Expo 58\", Journal of the Royal Architecture Institute of Canada (August 1958): 290- 295. 15 Humphrey Carver, \"Planning in Canada\", Habitat (Ottawa, September -October 1960): 2. Canada was not, of course, unmodern: the nineteenth century witnessed heroic works of engineering, including a transcontinental ra ilway, which shaped a collective sense on being a young nation. By the early twentieth century, major cities had experiences massive planning and infrastructure, with large- scale architecture - railways stations, hotels, and department stores - that relie d on imported senses of American know -how. 16 For modernist town planning principles adopted in Canada during the Second World War , see: Architectural Research Group, \"Planning\", Journal of the Royal Architecture Institute of Canada (January 1944): 10 -17. The Architectural Research Group (ARGO), based in Ottawa, remarked that the postwar architect would \"no longer be expected to work within the small confined of individual achievement in respect to individual buildings. Rather, 'collective' or 'group' eff orts should deal with the great social works which will be required to keep faith with those who have fought so hard on our behalf of our country and its future.\" ARGO described \"our approach , \"work\". welfare state, with government viewed as necessary to organising public and priva te provisions of infrastructure for the common good . The future was seen in terms of techno- scientific solutions to social needs . In architectural terms, the growing presence of megastructures - massive a rchitectures containing large programmes for shaping a new mass society - in Canada was first captured in John Andrews's Scarborough College of 1965, an enormous building -cum -campus set in a then -distant Toronto suburb and equipped with closed cir cuit tele vision as an innovative educational tool providing \"flexible\" (a keyword of 1960s architecture culture) means of instruction and edification (fig. 0.4). An earlier though still resonant source of Canadian anxiety had arisen over the complementary relation ship between technology and mass distraction inevitably weakening national culture .17 Now, key forms of technicism - a faith in mass media that, here, included architecture conceived in terms of its \"life cycle\", or obsolescence, and writ large in the uses and aesthetics of prefabrication - were given state sanction in light of growing cities and suburbs, increasing university enrollment, and rising immigration. The modernisation of Canadian culture as a mass culture was, then, to see it perforce contributing to global artistic and scientific discovery. The van Ginkels' ceasele ss rendering of the world's fair in terms of pacific endeavours like Arctic exploration - thus hemispheres, not nations - culminated in the official division of Man and His World i nto a series of subthemes: Man the Producer, Man the Explorer, Man the Provider, Man the Creator, and 17 Kuffert, A Great Duty: Canadian Responses to Modern Life and Mass Culture 1939 -1967, 212. 15 Man in the Community. The parsing was the rejection of nationhood (and nationalism) in favour of artistic, cultural, and scientific inquiry . Rather than comparisons with the past, Expo 67 would try to situate the near future. This meant envisioning the social world of 1967 in terms of architectures responding to the subdivisions of \"Man\" - specifically, as the van Ginkels' and their architect allies would argue, with such themes becoming the \"components\" of a \"single structure\". 18 Two implications were clear: first, an architectural work registered at the scale of the urban; second, a unique aesthetic -organisational form enabling the qualitative equalisation of \"things\". The argument was remarkable, upending inherited ideas, even prejudices, on how world's fairs, and architecture, were assumed to privilege the status of nations. Little of it came to pass. The van Ginkels' ambitions were to succumb to de mands for staging a world's fair in its most typical senses. Along the way, they were made to surrender an earlier and preferred project of transforming space relations in the existing city by leveraging the world's fair as a massive programme of urban renewal. This proposal, Man in the City, linked heritage sites, areas for housing prototypes, an international pavilions zone, and transportation networks along a single line of action. The plan, which could have been among the first realisations of Team 1 0 urbanism , was inevitably prey to political expediency . Neither project - to oppose the nation -state or to rebuild the city in toto - finally arose. Expo 67 was atomised by national or corporate pavilions, each competing by its 18 R. Affleck, Michel Canadian Montreal . 16 progressive or kitsch a rchitecture (fig. 0.5). Yet out of this failure , two works of architecture - two official theme pavilions - emerged. Both embodied the van Ginkels ' hopes well after they had resigned from Expo 67 . The first, Man the Producer, a huge space structure of s teel truncated tetrahedra produced by the Montreal office Arcop, drew on early ambitions to situate the entire fair in a uniquely massive form (fig. 0.6). The second, Habitat 67, a permanent housing complex designed by Moshe Safdie, continued the ambition to reshape permanently space relations in th e city. Capturing tendencies of \"cluster\" or \"cellular\" geometries rife in the 1960s, it became among the most celebrated works at Expo 67 (fig. 0.7). Seen as important early contributions to megastructural id eas, the pavilions satisfied desires, held by architects and critics alike, for innovative technics as engendering new forms of social life . Yet both Expo 67 and megastructures faced a fundamental tension between ideas on spontaneous versus engineered social worlds. The challenge remained whether large-scale experimental architecture, here constructed well outside the limits of everyday life, could actually fulfill the greater demands of cultural representation in the late twentieth century. *** In this grand arc of experiment lies an arc hitectural history of Expo 67. The trajectory - from the van Ginkels' early plans, through readings of their intellectual borrowings, across the many contemporaneous urban theories bearing on the master plan, and ultimate ly to the partial results of Man the Producer and Habitat 67 - was swift: 17 December 1959 Canada submits its candidacy to the Bureau International des Expositions (BIE) in Paris for hosting the 1967 world exhibition May 1960 The BIE awards the exhibition to the Soviet Union to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the October Revolution April 1962 Moscow informs the BIE that it is withdrawing from the project. Canada renews its bid and Montreal Mayor Jean Drapeau campaigns on behalf of his city June 1962 The van Ginkels and allied architects begin exchanging ideas on what a world's fair should represent in the late twentieth century. At the invitation of leading businessmen, the van Ginkels prepare Man in the City, a plan for situating the world's fair th roughout downtown Montreal November 13, 1962 The BIE awards the world's fair to Montreal. Drapeau is in Paris to receive the news December 20, 1962 The Canadian Parliament passes an act approving the incorporation of the Canadian Corporation for the World Exhibition (CCWE) January 1963 Paul Bienvenu and C.F. Carsley, Montreal businessmen, are appointed Commissioner General and Deputy Commissioner General respectively. Later, Claude Robillard, head of Montreal's urban planning department, is made Director General. Daniel van Ginkel becomes chief planner and assembles a staff of talented young architects to develop the master plan January 26 -27, 1963 The Order of Quebec Architects holds a weekend retreat to define the programmatic aims of the world's fair. The deliberations are organised following discussions among the van Ginkels and Montreal architects. Key ideas on the Expo 67 theme emerge March 1963 The Expo 67 site is announced: it will be set on Ile Notre - Dame and Ile Ste -H\u00e9l\u00e8ne in the middle of the St Lawrence River. The choice is strongly supported by Montreal mayor Jean Drapeau, who sees the world's fair as contributing to Montreal's greatness. The van Ginkels, Robillard, and others openly disagree with the choice May 1963 The BIE approves the islands site May 21 -25 1963 The Montebello Conference brings together leading Canadian intellectuals (including architects) and defines the Expo 67 theme: Man and His World or Terre des Hommes 18 July 1963 The City of Montreal begins filling and dredging operat ions for the islands site September 1963 With the departure of Bienvenu and Carsley, who reluctantly supported the islands and warned of rising costs, Pierre Dupuy, a retired diplomat, and Robert F. Shaw, a businessman, become Commissioner General and Depu ty Commissioner General respectively. Robillard resigns soon thereafter December 1963 Despite his longstanding objection to the islands site, van Ginkel's design team delivers the Expo 67 master plan. Originally designed as massive structures to which all nations would contribute, the fairgrounds layout is finally marked by plots for individual pavilions. Key theme pavilions are to be located throughout to lend coherence. The plan is submitted to the governments of Canada and Quebec for approval. Van Ginkel resigns 1964 Throughout the year, Dupuy travels and presses for national and international participation at the fair. Promotional campaigns, which continue until the fair's opening, are mounted in Canada, the United States, and abroad. Eventually, over 65 nations build pavilions July 1, 1964 The City of Montreal hands over the site to the CCWE. It is divided into four areas: the entrance Cit\u00e9 du Havre, a part of the port of Montr\u00e9al; an exhibition area on Ile Ste -H\u00e9l\u00e8ne (connected by the new Concor dia Bridge across the St Lawrence River); a second fairgrounds area on Ile Notre- Dame; and an amusement park on the east side of Ile Ste - H\u00e9l\u00e8ne. 1965 Technical missions go to London, Paris, Washington, and Moscow to hold conferences on explaining the Exp o 67 theme. Construction of the fairgrounds and pavilions begins April 28, 1967 Expo 67 opens October 28, 1967 Expo 67 closes its gates. 50 million people attend the fair over six months Expo 67 was said to begin by an official A ct of Parliament bringin g into existence the Canadian Corporation for the World Exhibition (CCWE). More than a managerial authority, a paymaster, a commissioning agent, and a host to foreign nations, the CCWE was an archive . This was both its civilising purpose - to present an image of world history - 19 and actual organisation. From 1963 until the close of the world's fair and eventual the issue of the final five -volume General Report on the 1967 World Exhibition in 1969, every letter, memorandum, meeting minute, photograph, rep ort, speech, and, indeed, architectural drawing was deposited - in English and French, the two national languages - at the Public Archives of Canada . As breathtakingly huge bureaucratic undertakings, a ll world exhibitions had been similarly constituted since the nineteenth century. T he labelling, indexing, and filing were to inform the voluminous reports issued afte r the close of every exposition, thereby serving the construction of official culture. In this lay a misrepresentation of history . The CCWE a rchive was incapable of accommodating things existing before its creation - its mission was not expansive but restrictive. As such, it produced a myth of origins, one based on promoting the renowned Montebello Conference as bestowing the theme Man and His World and defining its architectural programme. The narrative was immediately canonised in journalistic accounts and repeated ad infinitum over decades. The story was false. In fact, the origins of Expo 67 lay elsewhere, in the deliberations of Montrea l architects, including the van Ginkels, when defining Terre des Hommes - as a work of architecture - long before history was made to begin by parliamentary fiat. To understand their work as the raison d'etre of Expo 67 is to pose multiple intellectual af finities against the official record. To do is to recuperate a lost project, one that pinpoints modern architecture as protagonist of Expo 67. With their immersion in CIAM, Team 10, and North American urban renewal , the van Ginkels worked on remaking the \"world\" in built form. The synthesis of tendencies and sources, the 20 interweaving of personal consciousness and professional worldview, was tied to a purposeful appropriation of critical architectural ideas as statements on future possibilities.19 In othe r words, these discourses and their use s, as spatial systems and knowledge categories, were objects as much as any work of architecture . These artistic -social avant -gardes (who may well have seen themselves also as technocratic elites) wished to close the gap between discursive acts (the speculations on a future Terre des Hommes ) and pragmatic ones (the creation of Man in the City by techniques of architectural design ).20 However naively, the architects felt confident that they could collapse division s between thought and action, thereby advancing nothing less than a world historical project in which architecture could usher the stabilisation of societies. The history of the early architectural ideals behind Expo 67 is a statement on late modernity . In 1967, architects and others still retained a historical self -consciousness of markedly modernist conviction and long duration - on the one hand, an abiding faith in technological salvation and, on the other hand, the sense of some genuine mass culture and political subjectivity giving rise to a new citizen of the world. At the very same moment, this universalism was fraught with ambiguity : on the one hand, the model was being challenged by, say, decolonisation and the impression of new global alignments; on the other hand, this emancipation was accompanied by the ongoing extension of techno-science in the 19 Michel Foucault, The Archaeology of Knowledge (1969; New York: Pantheon Books, 1972), Stimson, The World: Its Nation , -Nagy 1917- 1946 (Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press, 1997), 3. 21 capitalisation of recently revealed global labour forces and spaces of industrial production. The van Ginkels' project was marked by this former sympathy and latter utility. Put another way, their philosophical ideal, characteristic of so many postwar North American architects, had not yet come to derive its critical distance by rejecting Enlightenment reason, encyclopaedic understanding, and universal self -realisation. (The parallel rise of the Canadian welfare state - and the impression of unremitting economic prosperity - supported this view.) The aim for Expo 67 was , again, somehow to channel the passions of nationalism into alternative forms of social belonging and public life outside nation -state chauvinism or consumerist distraction. The architects believed deeply in the idea of nation as a force for \"good\" while wishing to protect their project from the nationalist nightmares of the not-so -distant past. The late modern suggests, therefore, a historical phase - that is, a transitional moment between the mechanical and the informational. This shift was characterised by both a fetishisation of visible reservoirs of energy (machines whose stored labour is apparent and can b e explosively reactivated) and a ceaseless transmission of signals whose relation to human energy was problematic but offer ed an immense new field in which people could immerse themselves .21 The world's fair was to be precisely this k ind of scape , offering a pre -emptive space for preparing individuals for future forms of socialisation. The \"other\" history of Expo 67 - perhaps the most consequential twentieth -century world's fair in terms of projecting the utopian hopes of modern arch itecture - was necessarily short -lived and unfulfilled . Man the Producer and Habitat 67 could be understood as the half - 21 Fredric Jameson, Brecht and Method (London and New York: Verso, 1998 ), 178. 22 lives of this lost project. It ended with truly remarkable architectures emblematising the heroic aspirations of the 1960s - but symbo lising, as nation -state pavilions, precisely what was to have been avoided in the \"pre\" -history of Expo 67. Still, like so many modernist plans , including those doomed to failure, this one started with vanguard architects finding themselves in the right place at the right time. 23 Chapter 1 : City WORLD 'S FAIR (EXPOSITION ): Subject of frenzy for the nineteenth century Gustave Flaubert, Dictionary of Received Ideas (1870s) I hear there's entry only to those with green hair, ...In the next world's fair, Because of the gamma ray. Joe St rummer & the Mescaleros, \"Gamma Ray\" (2001) This time it would be different. In early September 1962, right after Labour Day, Montreal city councillors formally requested the Government of Canada to submit an official bid to the Bureau International des Expositions (BIE) in Paris for hosting the 1967 world's fair. Two years earlier, Canada had sought to bring the 1967 International Exhibition, officially sanctioned by the BIE and maintaining the long tradition of world's fair since the nineteenth century , to Montreal. The BIE had, by a narrow margin, rejected the Canadian tender in favour of the Soviet Union and the expected celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of its revolution. On April 13, 1962, Moscow unexpectedly withdrew. O n May 11, Canada again presented its candidacy, asking that it be given until November to resubmit a full application. The first Canadian bid had been a dull, unimaginative exercise in promoting a glorified trade show in light of the newly opened St Lawrence Seaway. The new effort promised something more: a vision of a confidently modern nation anticipating its upcoming Centennial. The 1962 initiative would be ambitious. Contemporary architecture was to be advanced as the principle means of creat ing cultural capital for a world's fair. At its heart, this process would find the exhibition elaborated in terms of reform ing the enduring influence of prewar doctrines on town planning espoused by the Congr\u00e8s Internationaux 24 d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM) . The proposed works were to be nothing short of heroic . Drawing on contemporary theories of urban renewal (as slum clearance) along with the emerging discourses of Team 10, a postwar group of largely European architects (with increasing influence in North America) challenging CI AM orthodoxy, the world's fair quickly became a discourse on how to redevelop Montreal. The cultural , economic, and political reasons for hosting a world's fair owed to two ambitions. On the one hand, impetus came from the federal government's desire to project the upcoming Canadian Centennial on an international stage , thereby upholding Canada as a beacon of global fraternity. On the other hand, it was local , often private, initiative that first fashion ed reasons for an architectural response - one grou nded in the most up-to -date design theory - to the host city. Starting in the summer of 1962, the Mo ntreal Citizens Committee (MCC), group of businesspeople directly involved in civic affairs and buttonholing City Hall on urban improvement, set out to sol icit a plan for the world's fair. The group's charismatic Secretary Michel Chevalier was especially close to H.P. Daniel van Ginkel and Blanche Lemco van Ginkel, a husband -and-wife team of architects and town planners who had established an office in Mont real in 1957. The van Ginkels had, beginning in the 1960s, undertaken a series of studies for the MCC that became instrumental to the city's planning . Deeply sensitive to local conditions and histories, the van Ginkels nevertheless brought to bear an imm ersion in the theories and practices of the modernist movement in architecture (including certain avant-garde tendencies) . This 25 intellectual framework would shape their critical contribution to conceptualising and planning the Montreal world's fair . The v an Ginkels' participation owed to an invitation extended by Chevalier. At the behest of the MCC, the van Ginkels had undertaken previous studies for ameliorating parts of Montreal. These efforts imagined massive infrastructural changes to the downtown co re while safeguarding patrimonial built fabric. The van Ginkels' earliest thinking on the future exposition was similar in intent: to provide a long -term rationale for improving the city as a whole. 1 It was, as the van Ginkels came repeatedly to note, to be a counterargument to the upcoming 1964 New York world's fair organised by Robert Moses, the longstanding and powerful planning czar who had, early in career, likened his work to Baron Haussmann's transformation of Paris in the Second Empire. 2 They esp ecially opposed the typical fairgrounds layout (at Flushing Meadows in the New York borough of Queens, and originally prepared by Moses to host the 1939 world's fair). The Montreal City Planning Department had earlier scrutinised several sites far outside the downtown core. Adamantly against an extra-muros setting, Daniel van Ginkel wrote to Chevalier in mid -June 1962, when presenting his office's very first proposal: As we have previously discussed, the odds are against the success of a fair in Montreal in 1967 if it based on the customary pattern - because of the proximity in time and distance to the New York Fair of 1964. However, if it has a strong theme which has 1 Margaret Emily Hodges, Blanche Lemco van Ginkel and H.P.

The fair was not sanctioned by the BIE and many countries, including Canada, refused to participate. 26 universal appeal and if the total concept is new and purposeful, we firmly believe that Montreal 1967 can be a resounding success. We therefore propose a scheme which focuses upon the city - both as a theme and in its physical relationship to Montreal. One might remember, in this connection, that the exhibitions which had the greatest international impact were those at the end of the last century, which had a very strong theme of universal appeal. The unprecedented volume of city building in the second half of the 20 th century, makes the city a matter of profound interest and concern in every country, whether highly developed or in a period of transition. 3 To intervene directly in Montreal was an argument not only for local renewal but to see urbanism as a pressing issue of global concern. As such, van Ginkel insisted on opposing commerce with culture. The insistence on some organising theme - as opposed to spectacle - could, it was hoped, inculcate a sense of universal humanistic sentiment appropriate to a world exhibition. The earliest, most polemical, partially realised, but ultimately influential designs of the Expo 67 rested entirely on theorising the rebuilding of the modern city. The heroic nineteenth -century expositions had been catalysts of urban development and their most famous architectures, typically long -span and ferro -vitreous, would serve as litmus for the architects soon advancing the Montreal world's fair. Yet in 1967, as van Ginkel suggested to Chevalier, a world's fair could no longer be produced as an enclave; rather, it demanded to be set permanently within the city exigencies. The projected civic ideal drew on a unique lineage of modernist debate in which CIAM edicts were challenged in a postwar climate marked by new forms of internationalism and urban life. It owed, too, to the context of a 3 H.P. Daniel van Ginkel, Letter to Michel Chevalier (July 2, Series 27- A21-11, Fonds van Ginkel , Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal. 27 Canadian city grappling with its urbanity that anticipated a quick adoption of the norms and forms of modern architecture as means of emblematising the future North American (and not necessarily European) city. Above all, the Expo 67 schemes were resolutely to advance a spirit o f visionary architecture in how the plan was defined - not only by processes of design but in the uses of architectural discourse. CITY The van Ginkels' sense of the Montreal exposition rested squarely on theorising the rebuilding of the modern city. Rat her than a short -term spectacle of contrasting peoples and things, the world's fair was posited as directing both embedded and emergent cultural and financial capital toward rearranging space relations in the existing - and remodelled - city. Montreal was, as host, to be a \"live\" demonstration of urban renewal techniques, debt-financed by public monies as a civic \"good\", which would apply and express the aesthetic and technological values of modernist architecture . This kept, of course, with a fundamental purpose of world's fairs: not only to serve as spaces of popular education, but, with the display of new technologies, systems of communications, ethnographic showcases, and works of art, to make largely capitalistic, democratic society conscious of its o wn modernity. In the schema of world's fairs, the ambition of technocratic elites to fashion a public consensus on - and support for - technical, sociological, economic, even artistic concerns was, here, to be directed toward the \"city\". 28 World's fairs typically stood apart from the city. Even as they ushered urban change, the exhibitions were temporary. As in a fata morgana, visitors could imagine themselves to be in distant worlds or times, only cruelly to be awoken amid ruins where the spectacle - writ large in architecture - once stood.4 The illusory proposition was markedly utopian: its very impermanence assumed the production of social relations - in a temporary city - outside the limits of everyday life. At the same time, a long -standing praxis of utopianism demanded fixing the future in the terms of the present: an ideal city based on , even showcasing, real and lasting improvements. In Montreal, there was to be no rude awakening from any dream world, any perfect vision of ordered society, since the very facts of its constitution - buildings and infrastructure - would be achieved in real time and for a very real need. The city was not to be simply a site for development but a space of acculturation. Montreal would be used to show how the metr opolis could, by the interrelations of large-scale architectural works, be adapted to a new, advanced stage of urban life. While this process was to follow local social and political concerns, it was really to consider how far more universal - read: moder nist - design tenets could be tested , thus idealised for emulation elsewhere. If Montreal was to become itself a world's fair in toto , then it meant serving as the very context in which modern architecture could be intelligibly displayed. Thus the van Ginkels' insistence, in their very first letter to Chevalier on \"Montreal's World Fair 1967\", that the \"city\" be thought as a \"theme\". 5 Believing that \"the exhibitions which had the 4 Pieter van Wesemael, Architecture of Instruction and Delight: A Socio -historical Analysis of World Exhibitions as a Phenomenon (1798 -1851 -1970) (Rotterdam: 010 Publishers, 2001) , 17. 5 Van Ginkel, Let ter to Michel Chevalier, 1 . 29 greatest international impact were those at the end of the last century (Fr ench, incidentally), which had a very strong theme of universal appeal\", the van Ginkels - obviously recalling the 1867 and 1889 Paris Expositions universelles , and echoing the determining Saint -Simonian belief in a new progressive society ushered by scien tific advance and works of engineering - evoked events fundamental to the construction of mass culture on a global scale. Indeed, the engineer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric le Play, a committed Saint-Simonian, had conceived the 1867 Exposition around a notion of the Enlighten ment encyclop\u00e9die as a way to present a total vision of knowledge.6 He organised the Colis\u00e9e de Fer, a vast ferro-vitreous \"coliseum\" , in seven concentric rings around which visitors circumambulated to compare the similar production (machinery, the arts) of different nations, or cut through single wedges directly toward the centre to survey the varied output of a single country. The idea of \"city\" as \"theme\", circa 1967, was to re-enact a similarly multifaceted but assuredly universalising project. Van Ginkel's emphasis on the \" unprecedented volume of city building in the second half of the 20 th century\" - then not even two decades old - was to insist on an interest in modern urbanism - thus modernisation - shared around the world.7 The urban imaginary o f First and Third Worlds, to say little of Cold War Second World states, was believed conjoined in a shared recurring dream: to see city design as enabling better futures. The wilful collaps ing 6 Paul Greenhalgh, Ephemera l Vistas: the Expositions Great Exhibitions and World's Fairs, 1851 - 1939 (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1988), 20. 7 Van Ginkel, Let ter to Michel Chevalier, 1 . 30 together of global cultures kept, quite simply, with a far gr eater and longstanding \"theme\" of world's fairs - namely progress. The van Ginkels' insistence on the \"city\" as an emerging but universally -held preoccupation was, at least discursively, grounded in a latent ethos of world's fairs - the conscious projecti on of human self -development. T he binding aspect of a \"theme\" (again, the \"city\") was to announce a new phase in human affairs or, really, of history. This demanded both capture of and break from the past. It held, for the van Ginkels, millenarian significance. In their first detailed report to Mich el Chevalier, submitted in late July 1962, they opened with prophecy followed by historical sweep: NEW YORK '64 WILL BE THE LAST OF THE OLD WORLD'S FAIRS. MONTREAL '67 CAN BE THE FIRST OF A NEW ERA IN INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITIONS. The great exhibitions were the product of the industrial revolution. They appeared at a time when the shift from handwork to machine production made itself obvious.... The industrial exhibition foretold the transformation that was to be affected in man, as well as in industry, in human feelings as well as in human surroundings. The second period of exhibitions in the latter half of the 19 th century was international. This was the period of great exhibitions that left an indelible mar k on our environment - not only in their stimulus to industry, but in their innovations in engineering, construction and architecture.... By the end of the 19 th century, industry was no longer a source of wonder. The series of international exhibitions of the 20th century gradually lost creative momentum.... If the international exhibition is to survive as a medium for the exchange of ideas - if it is to be a potent force in international affairs it must find a new raison d'etre. 31 THE NEW YORK WORLD'S FAIR O F 1964 WILL BE THE END OF AN ERA.8 The \"end\" - and the \"new era\" - appeared in the deliberate eclipse of \"world's fair\" by \"international exhibition\". It was not only the dismissal of an assumed commercialism (anticipated in the upcoming 1964 New York Wo rld's Fair) but the recasting of a contemporary mass spectacle in the spirit of past events thought capable of synchronic \"transformation\" of people (\"man\") , technology (\" industry \"), culture (\"human feelings\") , and the environment (\"human surroundings \" or buildings and cities). The harkening back to colossal preced ents of the nineteenth century - the lessons of 1851, 1867, or 1889 to which the van Ginkels would very soon assign prognostic architectural value - demanded the recuperation, in 1967, of some fo rm of zeitgeist . \"Space -age and science will be old hat in 1967 and any theme will require a more cultural, socio -cultural or socio -economic approach\"; hence a \"new raison d'etre\" - for an exposition, for civilisation - evinced in the \"universal preoccupa tion with the city\": The sheer volume of city building has never occurred before. This is so in highly industrialized countries such as the United States, as much as in those which are in transition from an agrarian economy.... New cities are being built o n every continent. There is massive rebuilding of older cities, and the ideas behind city building have free currency throughout the world. Here is a theme of international interest... a spirit founded on the exchange of ideas and capable of having a profo und effect on the way man lives. THE THEME OF THE WANING 20th CENTURY IS THE SURGING CITY. 9 8 Van Ginkel Associates, \"Montreal World's Fair 1967\" (July 27, Series 27 -A21-04, Fonds van Ginkel , Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal. The United States was not member of the Bureau International des Expositions (BIE); the New York world's fair was, therefore, not officially sanctioned. Canada, Australia, many European Nations, and the Soviet Union did not participate. 9 Van Ginkel Associates, \"Montreal World's Fair 1967\", 3-4. 32 1967 was to be a historic juncture, the marker of an inevitable and infinitely expanding late modern form of life organised by the demands to design for the \"surg ing city\". Here, all nations would, at least discursively, be collected under one \"spirit\" ; the twinned tasks of \"rebuilding of older cities\" and erecting new ones was to collapse any cultural, even spatial, differences between First and Third Worlds, oth erwise registered by the uneven development of global urbanisms. The suggestion of an \"idea\" with \"free currency\" was, therefore, to indicate that worldwide urban practices owed to a common wellspring of modernist theory. To recuperate somehow the prophetic ambition of \"universal exhibitions\" (as opposed to \"world's fairs\") was to reset the ratio of history: if the nineteenth-century exhibitions \"foretold the transformation that\" - with industrialisation - \"was to be affected in man\", then a late -twentiet h-century exposition would have \"a profound effect on the way man lives\" by resituating space relations in a post -industrial \"city\" (as \"theme\"). Montreal in toto was to be testbed of this epochal change. The \"theme of THE CITY should be borne out in the site of the Fair\", the van Ginkels again asserted. \"Fortunately, favourable conditions exist in Montreal. By taking advantage of some slum areas which are due for renewal \" - duly noted as ripe for Federal Government grants - \"and by extending the shore w ith fill (which has been proceeding for some time) cheap land is available close to the heart of the city .\" 10 While the locus was apparently justified by the immediate socio -economic rubric of slum clearance and the geotechnical demand of land 10 Ibid., 4, emphasis added. 33 reclamation, the design criteria were to be manifested in key discourses on postwar urbanism. \"The Heart of the City\" had been the theme of the eighth CIAM meeting held in Hoddesdon, England, in July 1951. Meant to shift CIAM discourse away from a preoccupation with functionalist housing, \"Heart of the City\" was among the earliest discussions on the public realm in the changed circumstances of contemporary architecture, especially in terms of architect-designed urban gathering spaces.11 Emphasis was now to be placed on the \"Core\": a counter -project - described by Sigfried Giedion, the long-standing CIAM secretary -general and polemicist of movement - to \"the over -employed term 'civic centre'\" that could be designing \"spontaneity\" - an \"emot ional experience\" achieved by \"reconquering the of with the \"man -made construction\" of \"undisturbed spaces\".12 The stress on relationships rather than fixed forms was to project a new postwar social collectivity that included rehabilitated downtowns and spectacles like world's fairs.13 (The celebrated example was Le Corbusier's unrealised plan for the war destroyed French industrial city of Saint-Di\u00e9. The plan had, in fact, penetrated North American architecture culture with its las t-minute inclusion an exhibition, organised by the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, that opened on September 20, 1945, in Rockefeller Center and by May 1947 had been shown at fifteen locations throughout the 11 Eric Mumford, The CIAM Discourse on Urbanism, 1928 -1960 (Cam bridge MA: The MIT Press, 2000), 215. 12 S. Giedion, \"The Heart of the City: Tyrwhitt, J.L. Sert, and E.N. Rogers, eds., The Heart of the City: Towards the Humanisation of Urban Life (London: Lund Humphries, 1952), 159-163. 13 Mumford, The CIAM Discourse on Urbanism, 1928- 1960, 214, 215. 34 United States as well as in Montreal, where Lem co van Ginkel would likely have seen it.14) Thus the van Ginkel s' mention of \"renewal\", which brou ght contemporaneous efforts at urban renewal within the purview of the future world's fair. In the Canadian context, this followed amendments to the 1956 Nat ional Housing Act. For the first time, \"urban redevelopment\" became official planning policy, thus allowing land purchased by federal funds to be used for commercial redevelopment.15 By the early 1960s, urban renewal - as political rhetoric, civic policy, and architectural theory affecting Western cities - varying called for demolishing blighted neighbourhoods, densifying downtowns, or building new cultural acropolises, all owing to the administrative capacities of government. As an instrument of large -scale design, it indicated just how Montreal could be made commensurate to an \"international exhibition\", and vice versa . Almost immediately, a plan appeared. It demanded \"the theme of THE CITY\" be \"part of the urban environment.\"16 Rendered solely by a large model, the scheme offered a series of massive podia supporting clustered structures, each base linked to the next across reclaimed city districts and the downtown core (fig. 1.1). International Sections along the waterfront, an International Housing Section downtown, a rehabilitated Old City, and, 14 Mary McLeod, \" Saint -Di\u00e9: 'A Modern Space Conception' for Postwar Reconstruction\", in Jean- Louis Cohen, ed., Le Corbusier: An Atlas of Modern Landscapes (New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 2013), 199, n22. 15 John C. Bacher, Keeping to the Marketplace: The Evolution of Canadian Housing Policy (Montreal and Kingsto n ON: McGill -Queen 's University Press, 1993) , 213. \"Urban redevelopment\" brought social housing (as well as corporate enclaves and arts centres) into the core of Canadian c ities while contributing to the razing of historic neighbourhoods. \"Urban renewal\" was officially adopted as a term in the 1964 National Housing Act. 16 Van Ginkel Associates, \"Montreal World's Fair 1967\", 4. 35 further to the east, a site for Canadian pavilions, were to become permanent infrastructure for improving Montreal. A transportation network tied each sector to the next. The plan appeared both as a rationalist framework and a system open to change. The tension between these poles - an urban gesture grounded in expressions of the \"functional city\" but somewhat distanced from the Cartesian logic of The Athens Charter - formalised ongoing postwar challenges to CIAM o rthodoxy. The van Ginkels' exhibition plan, soon titled Man in the City , betrayed effects of these paroxysma l debates to which they had in fact been party. Its basis as the evolving form of Expo 67 would, from the very start, follow the van Gink els' commitment to efforts in defining new norms of postwar urban doctrine. ORIGINS The preoccupation with \"city\" as \"theme\" owed to a previous decade -long reformulation of the programmatic aims of modern architecture. Central to this was the theory and practice of Team 10, a group of CIAM \"youngers\" - including, importantly, the van Ginkels - who wished to supersede the watertight categories of dwelling , work , leisure, and circulation , as enshrined in The Athens Charter , by deploying concepts like \"human associations\", \"cluster\", \"change and growth\", and \"mobility\" as means to create environments, often large-scale ones, reflecting anthropologically observed patterns of life.17 The van Ginkels would draw 17 Mumford, The CIAM Discourse on Urbanism, 19 28-1960, 7. 36 on these and related discourses, bringing a constellation of influence to bear on the world's fair. The van Ginkels' shared critique of prewar modernism stemmed from a deep immersion in its theory and practice. For van Ginkel, it was part of his grounding in discourses on the \"functional city\", the paradigmatic expression of CIAM urbanism. For Lemco van Ginkel, it owed to balancing European and North American approaches to urban design shaped by intellectual migrations between pre - and postwar Old and New Worlds, an exchange in which she would be a vital conduit. Born in Amsterdam in 1920, Daniel van Ginkel studied architecture followed by sociology. Completing his architecture studies during the German occupation of the Netherlands, van Ginkel refused the diploma because he would not sign the Nazi docum ents. He became member of the Dutch CIAM group De 8 Opbouw, whose influential member Cornelius van Eesteren was, in the 1930s, central to defining the \"functional city\". For van Eesteren this meant establishing the mutual relations of \"units of the metropolis\", which would be organised by both the \"rational\" use of statistical information as well as a kind of spatiality inherited from the influence of de Stijl. 18 Following the Second World War, van Ginkel practised in Sweden, where he encountered the new architecture of a social democratic state untouched by conflict. It was what J.M. Richards, editor of The Architectural Review , famously termed \"The New Empiricism\", a description of functionalism being \"humanized\" on the \"aesthetic side\" without becoming 18 Ibid., 61. 37 irrational: \"an attempt to be more objective than the functionalists\", Richards believed, \"and to bring back another science, that of psychology, into the picture\".19 Van Ginkel was especially affected by efforts at what he termed the \"reconditioning\" and \"rehabilitating\" of inner -city housing stock in Stockholm, twin processes that he would, immediately upon immigrating to Canada in 1957, contrast to the trends in \"development\" of Canadian cities involving total clearance and rebuilding. 20 The experience of Swedish approaches, which involved the preservation of historic quarters, offered an alternate model for resituating everyday life in the postwar metropolis. This was especially pressing given debates on how properly to reconstruct and to expand Europe an cities, a situation van Ginkel faced upon returning to Holland in 1951, when he began working on the redevelopment of the Amsterdam historic core under the direction of van Eesteren. While Amsterdam suffered little wartime damage, severe postwar housin g shortages led to implementing aspects of van Eesteren's prewar Expansion Plan, which had served as model for the crucial 1933 CIAM meeting on the \"functional city\". It was a debate to which van Ginkel would soon contribute, challenging the relevance of The Athens Charter to the arrangements of a postwar world. Blanche Lemco, too, bore modernist imprimatur. Having studied architecture at McGill University in Montreal, she moved to London in search of work and soon 19 J.M. Richards, \"The New Empiricism: Sweden's The CIAM Discourse 20 H.P. Daniel van Ginkel, \"Small Scale Action - Large Scale Activity: Rec onditioning in City Renewal\", Community Planning Review (June 1957): 97 -100. 38 participated in the sixth CIAM congress held in Bridgewater, England, in 1947. The following year, she arrived at Le Corbusier's office and designed the roof garden on the Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation, then under construction in Marseilles. In 1949, Lemco returned to North America, enrolling in the Depa rtment of City and Regional Planning at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. There she studied under Martin Wagner, who had been the powerful prewar chief city architect of Berlin in the 1920s; committed to urban planning as a tool of social change, Wagner oversaw the development of new housing estates by Bruno Taut, Walter Gropius, and others. Upon emigrating, Wagner became preoccupied by questions on decentralisation along the lines of American Greenbelt towns. At the same time, he retained his urban interests and joined early postwar calls for creating civic centres as means to renew the city. The idea reflected CIAM's \"Heart of the City\" and shaped the emergence of urban design as a discipline in North America during the 1950s and 1960s. 21 Lemco be came a key participant in this discourse. In 1951, she join ed the faculty at the University of Pennsylvania under the deanship of Holmes Perkins (previously her professor at Harvard) and led design studios until 1956. Crucially, at the suggestion of Jacqueline Tyrwhitt, a landscape architect and city planner closely tied to Giedion in CIAM and then teaching at the University of Pennsylvania , Lemco helped to initiate the Group for 21 Eric Mumford, Defining Urban Design: CIAM Architects and the Formation of a Discipline, 1937 -69 (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2009) , 196. Wagner was not a member of CIAM. While teaching city planning at Harvard, Wagner would, in the early 1940s, propose the design of prefabricated mass housing. For images of Wagner's projects, see: Anthony Alofsin, The Struggle for Modernism: Architecture, Landscape Architecture, and City Planning at Harvard (New York and London : W. W. Norton & Company, 2002), 139-140, 183. 39 Architectural Investigation (GAI), a Philadelphia chapter of CIAM.22 With GA I, Lemco soon participated in CIAM congresses at Aix -en-Provence (1953) and Dubrovnik (1956) that witnessed an emerging opposition to prewar functionalism. Attending the CIAM meetings of the 1950s, first separately and later as married, Lemco and van Gink el bore witness to debates, often fierce, on The Athens Charter . Resulting from generational dissatisfactions with functionalism, a series of postwar CIAM meetings, originally conceived as resurrecting the group's prewar aims, came to produce an entirely new lexicography for conditions by which modernism, and modern urban life, was to be considered . CIAM 8, the 1951 meeting that produced \"The Heart of the City\", had, despite ending inconclusively, expressed the desire to find some new basis for the archit ecture of social collectivity.23 Anticipating its next congress, CIAM thus charged a group of younger members to draft a \"Charter of Habitat\", now Le Corbusier's stated ambition, as a corollary to The Athens Charter . The issue was taken up at CIAM 9, whi ch convened at Aix -en-Provence in July 1953. Here, at what was the largest congress to date, Lemco met van Ginkel, her future husband. Despite the presence of over 3,000 delegates, members, and observers, the aim to define \"habitat\" remained elusive; for a like -minded younger generation, including Lemco and van Ginkel along with Aldo van Eyck, Jaap Bakema, Alison and Peter Smithson, 22 Mumford, The CIAM Discourse on Urbanism, 1928 -1960, 249. Along with Lemco, GAI included Robert Geddes, Romaldo Giurgola, and George Qualls. Tyrwhitt ha d also set up the planning programme at th e University of Toronto in 1951 . 23 Ibid., 215. 40 Georges Candilis, and Shadrach Woods, who would forge an alliance, the term came to represent a set of values associated wit h a \"more humane approach\" to modern architecture. The ambition was to achieve environments engendering relations between inhabitants and between a building and its surroundings, thus to accommodate the cultural needs of people. The idea was captured by the Moroccon group ATBAT -Afrique, which included Candilis and Woods, for apartment buildings replacing bidonvilles , or squatter settlements, in Casablanca. 24 Causing a sensation, the ATBAT work, designed with sensitivity to local sociological and cultural norms, revealed a general - and generational - dissatisfaction with CIAM. ATBAT accordingly framed its presentation around, first, detailed photographic and ethnological analysis of everyday life in a bidonville and, second, new housing typologies that seemingly adapted aspects of Le Corbusier's Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation to Islamic notions of privacy and a local climate. The qualitative approach was a remove from CIAM norms of codification: emphasis was placed on the role of embedded social habits, including street life and folk art, as crucial to imagining the modern urban environment. 25 Quotidian spatial practices were to be scrutinised in the hope of defining an expansive view on \"habitat\". Van Ginkel became instrumental to this shift in discourse. In late Ja nuary 1954, he convened a \"study weekend\" in Doorn, Holland, at the country home of his first wife. Here, van Ginkel, Jaap Bakema, Peter Smithson, John Voelker, an Annie Pedret, \"CIAM IX: Discussing the Charter of Habitat\", in Dirk van den Heuval and Max Risselada, eds., Team 10 1953- 81: In Search of a Utopia of the Present (Rotterdam: NAi Publishers, 2005) , 20-21. The analysis of the bidonville was undertaken by GAMMA (Groupe d'architectes modernes Marocains) and the housing blocks were built by ATBAT -Afrique; Candilis and Woods belonged to both groups. 25 Tom Avermaete, \"Habitat du plus grand nombre Grid, 1953\", in Max Risselada and Dirk van den Heuvel, eds., Team 10, 1953 -81: In Search of a Utopia of the Present (Rotterdam: NAi Publishers, 2005) , 26. 41 economist working in the Rotterdam municipal planning office, indepe ndently considered the subject of the next CIAM meeting. They concluded by issuing a \"Statement on Habitat\" that, while commending The Athens Charter as adequate to countering the \"chaos\" of the nineteenth -century city, sought \"a method which will liberate still further this potential\" of \"the 20th century\"; instead of simply \"towns\" (as produced under The Athens Charter ), new ways of comprehending \"human associations\" could allow \"urbanism as communities of varying degrees of complexity\".26 The polemic wa s illustrated by a \"Scales of Association\" diagram that, borrowing from the Scottish town planner Patrick Geddes's \"Valley Section\" of 1909, aimed at the comparative study of settlements in varying regions and countries (fig. 1.2). The Smithsons soon cano nised the proceedings as the \"Doorn Manifesto\" and fought to define the \"Scales of Association\" as specific types of habitat (in their parlance, \"house - street -district-city\").27 The Dutch architects, joined by van Eyck, took strong exception to the English approach, and argued for interpreting Geddes's diagram as a comprehensive tool for newly designed settlements. Van Ginkel and others thus sought to design complete city districts, even new towns, where the issue of \"number\" would be advanced by ostensibl y projecting some form of social cohesion via the programmed arrangement of buildings. 28 26 Bakema, van Ockman, ed., Architecture Culture 1943 -1968: A Documentary Anthology (New York: Columbia Books of Architecture/Rizzoli, 1993) , 183. 27 For the Smithsons' appropriation of the \"Scales of Association\", see their Urban Structuring: Studies of A lison & Peter Smithson (London: Studio Vista, 1967): 14- 20. 28 Francis Strauven, \"The Shaping of Number in Architecture and Town Planning\", in Max Risselada and Dirk van der Heuvel, eds., Team 10, 1953 -81: in Search of a Utopia of the Present (Rotterdam: N Ai Publishers, 2005) , 298-299. 42 The CIAM \"four functions\" were to face more fundamental questions on the specific scale and type of human collectivity.29 Van Ginkel's clique was soon entrusted with preparing a tenth CIAM gathering. The group thus labelled itself Team 10. The \" Doorn Manifesto\" declared a new beginning to CIAM urban doctrine . Its polemic coloured the last CIAM meetings held in Dubrovnik and Otterlo (September 1959), which established theoretical foundations for architecture culture in the 1960s. Lemco and van Ginkel, now married, appeared at Dubrovnik with their respective CIAM chapters: the former joining GAI to show a study on \"The problem of the relation of the automobile and home ownership in a suburban habitat\"; the latter by virtue of van Eyck's presentation of the Dutch De 8 group's new village of Nagele (for which he and van Ginkel designed three elementary schools). The van Ginkels' sympathies were clear. In the company of v an Eyck, Bakema, Volker, and the Smithsons, they mounted a placard declaring the \"death\" of CIAM at its final meeting in Otterlo (fig. 1.3). 30 With it were to rest the edicts of functionalist town planning. Van Eyck confidently project an entirely new paradigm on modern architecture and, by extension, city design. Recently made editor of the Dutch architecture journal Forum , van Eyck arrived at Otterlo armed with a special issue titled \"The Story of another Idea\" (also known as \"The Story of an Other Idea \"). The cover 29 Joan Ockman , Architecture Culture 1943 -1968: A Documentary Anthology (New York: Columbia Books on Architecture/Rizzoli, 1993), 181. Daniel van Ginkel recalled the rise of Team 10: \"Mainly it originated with a group of young people for whom man was total man and environment was total environment and for whom any division of function was a Cartesian dogma that had no place in a new image.\" See: H.P. Daniel van Ginkel, \"Credo\", Canadian Architect (July 1964): 46. 30 Otterlo was the last CIAM meeting, with a small group of members - thus hardly unanimous - deciding to abandon the name \"CIAM\". 43 was a pinwheel of nombre\", \"visual group\" ( fig. 1.4).31 Team 10 had first been convened as the \"CIAM research group for visual and social relationships\"; the new keywords gave contour to its search for a primal language in which form and meaning would be one.32 Lemco van Ginkel was crucial to this shift, having earlier joined Giedion and van Ey ck in preparing a session on \"Architectural Expression\" at CIAM 6. Theirs was an argument for questions of aesthetics meant to reorient rationalistic or mechanistic notions on progress - \"the tyranny of common sense\", in van Eyck's dismissal - and, by ext ension, city design.33 Lemco van Ginkel continued the critique when contributing the keywords - really ideograms - \"identity\" and \"visual group\" to Team 10 discourse.34 Both concepts, central to the thrust of van Eyck's Forum , supposed elementary signifying forms as the structural principles of urban growth. At its most anarchistic, the conscious suggestion of informal organisation was to imply a purposeful breakdown of architectural order into more culturally accessible arrangements . 31 The list was trilingual: English, French, and Dutch; translation s appear in Arnulf L\u00fcchinger, Structuralism in Architecture and Urban Planning (Stuttgart: Karl Kr\u00e4mer, 1981), 10-11. 32 Alan Colquhoun, Modern Architecture (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2000) , 218. 33 Mumford, The CIAM Discourse on Urbanism, 1928 179; '59 in Otterlo (Stuttgart: Karl Kr\u00e4mer, 1961), 12. A heated debate at CIAM 6 followed Giedion and van Eyck's session, ending with Le Corbusier enthusiastically exclaiming \"finally imagination comes to CIAM!\" (while having added \"we should place art at the summit of our preoccupations\" ). For a synopsis of CIAM 6, see: Giedion, A Decade of New Architecture (Zurich: Editions Girsberger, 1951), 30 -37. 34 Francis Strauven notes that Blanche Lemco van Ginkel was responsible for introducing the terms \"identity\", and \"visual group\" to Team 10 thinking. , 249-250. 44 Otterlo marked the van Ginkels' final appearance with Team 10. They had served on the Committee of Coordination and issued invitations to the congress, where they presented the master plan of a public park in St John's, Newfoundland (fig. 1.5).35 Yet having already immigrat ed to Montreal in 1957, the ir Atlantic crossing gave opportunity to test ideas in a context far removed from the paroxysmal debates (not least the abiding British and Dutch intellectual split as Team 10 became a \"family\" affair) consuming their European friends . 36 In this, Montreal was almost tabula rasa.37 The total lack of functionalist discourse in prewar Canadian culture gave way to a postwar context - a rapidly urbanising population, concurrent urban renewal of city centres, and the ready adoption of modern architecture as emblematising a new Welfare State - providing fertile ground for both CIAM precedent and its discontents. The van Ginkels would, upon arriving in Montreal, freely intertwine CIAM notions on the \"core\" and Team 10 thinking on the \"clus ter\" when imagining the future Canadian city. Describing the intellectual framework of the Expo master plan, Van Ginkel projected a 35 The van Ginkels' presentation is found in Oscar Newman, CIAM 36 Alison Smithson, who would do much to compile - and to revise - Team 10 history, described the group as \"a small family group of architects \". See: Smithson, ed., Team 10 Primer (Cambridge MA: The MIT Press, 1968). Team 10 had, almost from the start, witnessed a division, with van Eyck's \"structuralist\" line opposed to the Smithsons' latent functionalism. 37 For discussion on the van Ginkels' impact on Montreal architecture in the early 1960s, including the transformation of the municipal Service de l'Urbanisme ( by their sending its architects either to Harvard or the University of Pennsylvania for training in urban design), see: \" Rencontre avec Blanche Lemco van Ginkel\", in Legault, La ville qu'on a b\u00e2tie: Trente ans au l'habitation 1956 -1986 (Montreal: Editions as a \" casbah organis\u00e9e \".38 It was direct reference to van Eyck's exhortation, at the close of \"The Story of another Idea\", to design \" Vers une casbah organis\u00e9e \" - a deeply personal view on discovering in vernacular architectures a way to work outward from a basic element while achieving an overall form that would not appear to be predetermined (fig. 1.6). Trained also in sociology, van Ginkel shared van Eyck's ethnological interests, having accompanied his friend on a formative trip to North African oasis settlements in 1952; later, van Eyck would find his ultimate paradigm of human habitation in the Dogon cliff dwellings in Mali. Yet faced by the sheer scale of the North American city and the urgency of designing a world's fair in toto , Van Ginkel betrayed little of van Eyck's phenomenological limit; instead, he purposefully located the casbah o rganis\u00e9e elsewhere, in the heroic plans for the British new towns Hook and Cumbernauld being planned at this very moment as long, extendible multi-storey spines. The buildings were suggestions of megastructure , contemporaneously defined by Fumihiko Maki, member of the Japanese avant -garde Metabolist group, as a large frame in which all the functions of a city are housed. 39 Van Ginkel saw it as a fundamentally new building type: a \"single function building\", opposed to CIAM division of space, \"incorporating the daily activities of all citizens, the honky -tonk as well as culture, squalor as well as grace\".40 Appearing along the arc of the van Ginkels' thinking from CIAM to Team 10, the megastructure was soon 38 Van Ginkel , \"Credo\", 46. 39 Fumihiko Maki, Investigations in Collective Form (St Louis MO : Washington University School of Architecture, 1964), 8-13. 40 Van Ginkel, \"Credo\", 46. 46 contextualised in the colossal nineteenth -century p recedents made litmus of Expo 67and serving as the emblematic vessel of a new mass society. CITY, REDUX Central to the emergence of Team 10 out of CIAM, the van Ginkels would project Expo 67 in a similarly vanguardist spirit. Man in the City , their nasce nt world's fair theme that prepared Montreal for total transformatio n, had functionalist resonance. Yet it would also see the urban realm in terms of socio-psychological needs - \"human associations\" in Team 10 parlance - and resulting aesthetics. Indeed, the very title supposed replacing the modern mass by man . While this was not to reject senses of collective experience, it was to present individual perception as an agent of design. Nevertheless, CIAM doctrine continued as a determining base: the city was to be an object of study, intervention, display, and spectacle. From the start, the van Ginkels would insist that the unparalleled postwar explosion in worldwide city building made it a pressing subject of international interest. 41 Montreal was to be made to express this utterly unique moment in human history. The van Ginkels had, in fact, assiduously prepared studies on transforming large swathes of Montreal. Upon arriving in Montreal, they established Van Ginkels Associates Architects, Town Planners . By the early 1960s, they were heavily involved in the city's urban design. At the behest of the Montreal Citizens' Committee (MCC), the organisation of \"concerned\" businessmen later responsible for initiating the first world's fair plans, the van 41 Van Ginkel, Letter to Mich el Chevalier, 1. 47 Ginke ls consecutively undertook several comprehensive planning studies: the protection of Mount Royal Park (the city's urban \"lung\" first designed by Frederick Law Olmsted), the preservation of Old Montreal (given the slow eclipse of the port), and, importantly , the successful relocation of a proposed elevated expressway away from the waterfront (deemed historic by the van Ginkels) to the continuous east-west escarpment that ran directly through the downtown core. The studies quickly informed policy at the City Planning Division (with van Ginkel consulting on its complete reorganisation) as it suddenly faced Montreal's unprecedented transformation. 42 The very areas of the van Ginkels' proposals - \"old\" diminished districts of trade and manufacture contrasted to \"new\" emerging spaces of corporate seats and services - anticipated the urbanism of a post-industrial economy. Montreal was, in fact, in the throes of transformation. The downtown had undergone a swift change with the completion of I.M. Pei's Place Vill e Marie skyscraper in 1961. An early instance of post war corporate architecture in Montreal , it sat atop a growing subterranean network of shopping concourses and tunnels (and, later, the new Metro system). Popularly known as the \"underground city\", it was soon celebrated by architects and critics, including Peter Blake, the editor of Architectural Forum , as ushering \"the first 20 th century city in North America\" .43 A longstanding modernist fixation, the separation of 42 The van Ginkels exhibited their project s at the invitation of the City Planning Department, employing its staff members i n their office and establishing links between it and leading urban design schools ( notably at the University of Pennsylvania but also Harvard, where Lemco van Ginkel had, respectively, taught and studied). 43 Peter Blake, \"Downtown in 3 -D\", in Architectural Forum (September 1966) . 48 walking from traffic was, really, to privilege the mechanisation of movement (fig. 1.7). The idea quickly informed the van Ginkels' plans. The van Ginkels recognised the possibility of a new urban morphology. So did civic and business elites. On the commission of MCC secretary Michel Cheva lier - a figure tied to the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, the Port of Montreal Authority, and soon the future world's fair - the van Ginkels prepared their Central Area Circulation (CAC) study of 1961. 44 CAC gave dimension to Montreal as an infrastructural whole. Identifying underutilised space in the downtown core, thereby to reclaim uneconomical land uses, the van Ginkels sought \"new routes... connected in a workable pattern\" for \"a free flow of movement\" - thus capital - \"over the entire metropolis\" (fig. 1.8).45 Lemco van Ginkel nevertheless dismissed \"the term CBD\" (Central Business District) for its \"unfortunate\" connotations, insisting instead on \"the heart of the city\" where \"all the activities of man in community should exist in their highest form - not separately but in close interaction.\" 46 (The preferred example was Rockefeller Centre.) While offering a regional plan of highways, major roads, and local arteries, the van Ginkels pinpointed the downtown, already under transformation, for further mod ernisation. They proposed widened pedestrian ways and 44 In his capac ity as Secretary of both the MC C and the Port of Montreal, Chevalier regularly solicit ed the van Ginkels on urban design issues. With Lemco van Ginkel's encouragement, Chevalier eventually pursued a PhD in planning at the University of Pennsylvania. In 196 7, he returned to join the new Institute d'Urbanisme at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al . 45 Van Ginkel Associates, \"Central quoted in Blanche Lemco van Ginkel and H.P. van 252.

At the centre of this new infrastructure arose civic institutions set on a podium hovering above but conn ected to a network of staggered walkways and roads; ancillary extensions led to terraced housing linked by interwoven circulation paths . The \"multi-level pedestrian system\", Lemco van Ginkel argued, \"flowed from one level to another, connecting multiple functions of the city. Below ground, upon the ground and above the ground were regarded as equally significant\". 47 The conceit of a city freed from traffic echoed CIAM's isolation of \"circulation\", a gesture fundamental to the construction of modernity as the amelioration of insalubrious nineteenth -century life . It equally reflected CIAM's postwar embrace of \"The Heart of the City\" , which , as a correction to its \"four functions\", emphasised compact pedestrian civic centres as places of public life.48 Party to this debate on reorganising the modern city and its symbolism, Lemco van Ginkel further defined CAC: \"The visual impression of space is created by the superimposition of many images\"; thus, \"to see the 47 Blanche Lemco van Ginkel, \"The Centre City Pedestrian\", Architecture Canada (August 1966): 38. The CAC site was adjacent to I.M. Pei's recently completed Place Ville Marie, a cruciform skyscraper resting atop a multilevel network of shopping and transportation concou rses that became the first node in Montreal's famous \"underground city\". William Zeckendorf, the prominent American real estate developer, had invited Pei to design Place Ville Marie and other mixed -use and pedestrianised central city projects, which part ially represented the postwar CIAM values on \"core\" and urban design as expressed in The Heart of the City . For Pei's links to postwar CIAM thought, especially Giedion and Sert's reformulation of urban design at Harvard, see: Eric Mumford, \"The Emergence of Urban Design in the Breakup of CIAM\", in Alex Krieger and William S. Saunders, eds., Urban Design (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2009 ): 23-24. 48 Sigfried Giedion's call in Space, Time and Architecture (1941) for pedestrian civic centres p rovided the basis of his \"New Monumentality\" (1943) that , in turn, contributed to the CIAM discussions on the \"core\" during its 1951 congress in Hoddesdon, England. This led to the edited book The Heart of the City: Towards the Humanisation of Urban Life (New York: Pelligrini and Cudahy, 1952). For discussion on \"core\", see: Mumford, Defining Urban Design: CIAM Architects and the Formation of a Discipline, 1937 -69, 131-152. 50 whole of it and to receive a complete image it is necessary to move through the space\" .49 Evoking her notion on \"visual group\", which she had introduced to Team 10, Lemco van Ginkel argued for a dynamic perception of space that could make appreciable underlying abstract principles of urban design. The ci vic realm was not limited to an ideal figure - ground view of the traditional street but was extended spatially, through movement by mechanical or bodily means, across overlapping sections of a terraced core. CAC bore affinity to contemporaneous precedent. It made common cause with efforts to redefine the modern urban core in the wake of reform ing CIAM thinking. CAC recalled, in spirit (not in form), Louis Kahn's unrealised Philadelphia Centre City studies developed throughout the 1950s. Kahn saw the city as flux of movement patterns. He shifted traffic to edges of the downtown core (with cars left in massive cylindrical garages) thereby reserving streets for unhurried circulation (both pedestrian and vehicular); reclaimed space was given over to an honorific central esplanade hosting new civic institutions, with large sunken courtyards providing ample light, air, and access to public concourses below (fig. 1.9). 50 Kahn had, in fact, presented his project at the CIAM meeting in Otterlo. While his ideas c ame to shape Team 10 concerns on the city, Lemco van Ginkel was already aware of his work given her connections to Philadelphia. The van Ginkels acknowledged the influence when interviewing Kahn, who described architecture that \"can grow out of 49 Blanche Lemco van Ginkel, \"Aesthetic Considerations in Communi ty Planning\", Community Planning Review , vol. XI, no. 4 (1961), quoted in Hodges, Blanche Lemco van Ginkel and H.P. Daniel van Ginkel: Urban Planning , 262. 50 Peter S. Reed \"Philadelphia Urban Design\", in David B. Brownlee and David G. De Long, eds., Louis Kahn: In the Realm of Architecture (New York: Rizzoli, 1991), 307-311. 51 movement which can be of terrific service to the centre of the city.\"51 An apt description of CAC, Kahn's words appeared in a 1962 issue of Canadian Art edited by Lemco van Ginkel and devoted to \"The Automobile\". Divided \"Design with\", and \"Design for\" the car, the issue carried, in its third part, a significant article by van Ginkel titled, simply, \"The City\". Echoing Kahn's often essentialist propositions, van Ginkel described a city in which the car \"wants to experience the city as a totality\" but once having arrived in the core \"it loses its purpose and meaning\"; in turn, \"the driver wants to be a pedestrian\" when experiencing downtown life. 52 The \"basis of the solution is clear. The reestablishment of the visual scale of the pedestrian as well as the scale of movement.\" 53 While privileging the very act of walking in the city, the hope was for something altogether more dynamic. As such, only three \"visionary\" examples appealed to van Ginkel: Le Corbusier's viaduct autostrade projects of the early 1930s; Kahn's \"viaduct architecture\", a culminating gesture of his ongoing Philadelphia urban design studies, which served \"the architecture of movement\" by providing interconnections between the institutions of a new city centre; and Kenzo Tange's audacious 1960 proposal for a new city of 10 million people over Tokyo Bay as solution to acute congestion (fig 1.10). Perhaps distancing himself from the more shrill denunciations of functionalism by van Eyck and 51 Louis I. Kahn, \"The Animal World\", Canadian Art 77 (January -February 1962): 51. Unlike the Smithsons, Lemco van Ginkel had firsthand knowledge of the Philadelphia scene, having tau ght at the University of Pennsylvania and instigating GAI, the local CIAM chapter. 52 Daniel van Ginkel, \"The City\", Canadian Art (January -February 1962): 46. 52 others , Van Gi nkel viewed Tange's scheme - \"a structural reorganization\" of the city in which \"the consequences of locomotion have been fully accepted\" - as perfectly synthesising \"almost every aspect of the theories of men like Le Corbusier and Kahn - the great line ab out the centre about which Kahn speaks\" and \"the relation of the Unit\u00e9 d'habitation to the core in the manner that Le Corbusier has been working ever since Le Plan voisin for Paris.\"54 Tange's floating city centred on a double transport spine (for automobi le and monorail) that bound a \"civic axis\" of public institutions and to which were attached secondary lines of floating housing. Rendered as both utopian and buildable (with suggestion of large-scale prefabricated elements), the project expressed the aims of the Japanese Metabolist group, which emerged, circa 1960, by declaring: \"we believe design and technology should be denotation of human vitality.\" 55 Instrumental to theories on \"megastructure\", the Metabolists' organic analogies followed a sophisticated approach to building technologies.56 They shared Team 10 notions on \"change and growth\" and embraced Kahn's Philadelphia plan given its granting of architectural form to what were typically infrastructural spaces . 54 Ibid., Proposals for New Urbanism (1960), quoted in Joan Ockman, ed., Architecture Culture 1943 -1968: A Documentary Anthology (New York: Columbia Books on Architecture/Rizzoli, 1993), 319. The Metabolists appeared at the World Desi gn Conference held in May 1960 in Tokyo. Older by at least a generation, Tange, who had worked in Le Corbusier's atelier , was defined by Fumihiko Maki in Investigations in Collective Form (St Louis MI: Washington University School of Architecture, 1964) : 5, 8 -13. As opposed to \"megastructure\" (a \"structural approach\"), Maki preferred \"group form\" (a \"sequential which he believed more clearly expressed patterns of \"growth\" through the aggregati on of basic units - an approach not unlike that of Aldo van Eyck. 53 While lacking the more radical solution s of Kahn or the Metabolists, the van Ginkels' CAC nevertheless situated both CIAM and Team 10 doctrine as means to design Montreal. CAC served as blueprint for the world's fair plans. Man in the City, the van Ginkels' first articulation of a universal th eme of global concern , sought also to reshape space relations in Montreal itself. Montreal was to test and to display a worldwide desire for modernised cities: \"There exists a new technology\" - urban renewal - \"which has not been applied to the city.\"57 The resulting presentation model, quickly completed in July 1962, collaged in part the van Ginkels' recent projects. The strategy was one of enormous interventions with Man in the City coordinating issues of heritage, housing, and transportation into a sing le line of action.58 The entire city would be rezoned by a world's fair. Across \"six connected sections\", short -term needs provided reasons for the long-term planning of the city.59 Two International Sections built on landfill along the waterfront - a vis ion of land reclamation owing perhaps to van Ginkel's Dutch background - and \"designed as groups of pavilions in which each nation can express its individuality\" could be \"re -used as recreational or cultural buildings with interior modifications\". A perma nent International Housing Section - \"similar to Interbau\", the development showcasing works by leading international architects 57 Van Ginkel Associates, \"Montreal Wor ld's Fair Fairs\", in Civic Visions, World's Fairs (Montreal: Canadian Centre for Architecture, 19 93), 27. The approach to land reclamation for the world's fair site would be endorsed by the van Ginkels' architect allies in the City Planning Department; Legault, cr\u00e9tariat VM3 -S0-D3, City of Montreal 59 Associate s, \"Montreal World's Fair 1967\", 5 -6. 54 built in West Berlin in 1957 - was to spur the rebuilding of the downtown.60 Old Montreal was, in the standing ambition of the van Ginkels, to be \"rehabilitated and renovated\" and \"one of the oldest cities of North America restored to its rightful state\" as \"a centre of culture\" and commerce. Immediately adjacent to the city core was an amusement park - not permanent but aimed at removing \"substandard housing\" and \"redeveloped\" after the fair. To the east, the Canadian pavilions would be \"designed as shells so that, with interior change, they could be re-used for the C.B.C. workshops\" (thereby fulfilling an official proposal to b uild the headquarters of Radio Canada, the French language service of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation). A continuous transportation spine linked the six sites, each made of elements suggesting both tower and \"cluster\" architectures forming either superblocks or rising on massive podia. The large ensembles gave status to the exhibitionary purpose while securing areas from which future urban amelioration could be launched. Man in the City was heroic, projected at the critical mass of the city. Each large -scale grouping was, in turn, to create a city in miniature. The podia - for, say, the International Section or the Housing Exhibit - served this purpose: to locate new cultural ensembles for the regeneration of metropolitan life. \"In all our plans\", van Ginkel asserted, \"this has been the basic philosophy: First to give man the sense of belonging, to give identity to the cluster whatever its size may be. Then to design it in very close contact with all other elements that make up the city, not only schools and convenient shopping, but the total complexity of the 60 Van Ginkel would later state that this inner- city site (which was not coincidentally the location of their unrealised plan for Place Vi ctoria , a separate urban development project) would avoid the \"mistake of 'Interbau'\" because it was \"within the fabric of the city\". See : van Ginkel, \"Credo\", 52. 55 city.\"61 Again, van Ginkel admitted a Team 10 conceit: \"'cluster' which had obsessed us, along with so many others during the 1950's... forced us to make as complete as possible a separation between automobile and pedestrian.\"62 While van Ginkel linked \"cluster\" to megastructural works, the ideogram had broad signification, from Aldo van Eyck's interpretation of vernacular forms to Alison and Peter Smithson's \"Cluster City idea\" that, based on the reorganisation of road systems, emphasise d, as they put it, \"the question of social foci\". 63 Indeed, Man in the City had prec ursor in the Smithsons' 1958 Berlin - Haupstadt competition project, which advanced traffic -free enclaves as multilevel, interlinked podia - a \"pedestrian net\" - elevated above unimpeded roadways (fig. 1.11).64 The van Ginkels pursued a similar strategy of counterform - namely, to establish an urban \"fix\" against the space en dlessness of the motorised urban realm while recognising the promise of mass mobility.65 The Smithsons had also enthusiastically adopted Kahn's Philadelphia Plan in their \"open city\" thesis, with a permanently \"ruined\" urban form indicating that accelerated movement and change in the twentieth -century were incapab le of 61 Van Ginkel, \"Credo\", 48 , emphasis added. 62 Ibid., 47. 63 Alison and Peter Smithson \"Sca tter\" (April 1959), in Alison Smithson, ed., Team 10 Primer , (Cambridge MA: The MIT Press, 1968) , 64. 64 Alison and Peter Smithson in Alison Smithson, ed., Team 10 Primer , (Cambridge MA: The MIT Press, 1968) , 58. 65 Kenneth Frampton, Modern Architecture: A Critical History (London: Thames & Hudson, 1992), 275-276. 56 relating to the pattern of any pre -existing fabric.66 Without sharing the Smithsons more ironic view on the city, the van Ginkels accepted the status of the automobile as a disruptive, dominant form of cultural expression. Even as the balsawood elem ents defining their presentation model betrayed traces of the functionalist organisation of space, the architects accepted the outward expansion of the modern city as inevitable. The role of planning was, therefore, to ameliorat e past mistakes . The theory reflected Lemco van Ginkel's training at Harvard under Martin Wagner. As the powerful city architect, or Stadtbaurat , of Berlin during the Weimar Republic, Wagner had envisioned a solution to very large metropolises in his concept of a \"world city squar e\": The new spirit is that of the world -rank metropolis , it is the spirit that works to draw out people's resources in labour and recreation, civilisation and culture - resources superior to those of all a nation's other cities - and bring them to fruition in the form of unsurpassable achievement. This world -metropolis spirit will by definition be national in underlying character, international in style. But its most essential characteristic is self -belief , its awareness of its significance and of the responsibility it bears vis -\u00e0-vis other cities in other countries. 67 Written in 1929 with the critic Adolf Behne, Wagner's polemic uncannily foreshadowed the van Ginkels' defence of city as theme . The debate - which turned, in Berlin during the 1920s, on the merits of Amerikanismus , the skyscraper, and capitalist society - rested on 66 Ibid. The Smithson's were responsible for inviting Kahn to close the 1959 CIAM meeting in Otterlo. A year earlier, they had written, \"Louis Kahn's Plan for Midtown Philadelphia demonstrates h ow movement can be organically reorganized so that it is one with its inter -related functions of parking, shopping, etc.\" At Otterlo, Kahn discussed his Philadelphia projects, defining the \"meaning of street\" as \"a type of character, of movement, of go (a s Smithson has pointed out)\" . See: Alison and Peter Smithson in Alison Smithson, ed., Team 10 Primer , (Cambridge MA: The MIT Press, 19 68), 58; Louis Kahn \"Talk at the Conclusion of the Otterlo Congress\", in Oscar Newman, ed., CIAM t: Karl Kramer 67 Martin Wagner and Adolf Behne, \"The New Berlin - World City\" (1929), in Iain Boyd Whyte and David Frisby, eds., Metropolis Berlin 1880- 1940 (Berkeley CA: University of California Press, 2012) , 348. 57 defining the proper form - at once aesthetic and political - of the city. The deeply modern conviction, whether in the 1920s or 1960s, was to see the city in a continuous state o f flux (soon hallmark of the megastructure movement); hence, circulation - of people, of capital - as an effect of contemporary life to be made into a principle of design. Following Wagner's schematisation, this was to consider the massive \"city square\" as adapted to existing context: \"that function and form, plan and elevation, ground surface and street front fuse together into an organic unity .\"68 As such, differentiated traffic flows with separate lanes for people, vehicles, and streetcars, were juxtapo sed against shops, restaurants, offices, and public spaces (fig. 1.12).69 Crucially, the \"World City\" could only have a lifespan of about twenty -five years, after which it would be replaced. It was a sanguine view on the ongoing change and pace of urban e xperience. Man in the City shared the principle of the metropolis as incorporating and engendering different life cycles. In the parlance of automobile, it was a kind of planned obsolescence. 68 Martin Wagner, \"T he Design Problem of a City Square for a Metropolis\" (1929), in Iain Boyd Whyte and David Frisby, eds., Metropolis Berlin 1880- 1940 (Berkeley CA: University of California Press, 2012): 349. 69 Peter Blake, the German \u00e9migr\u00e9 modernist and, by the 1960s, editor of Architectural Forum , would describe Marcel Breuer's entry to the Potsdamer Platz competition of 1929 in similar Breuer: Archite ct York: 1949): 38-39; Mumford, Defining Urban Design: CIAM Architects and the Formation of a Discipline, 1937 -69, 31, 215.

The desire to impose order on cities, and accompanying technocratic optimism, resonated in the van Ginkels' repeated exhortation to see the world's fair as leveraging urban renewal, and vice versa . Indeed, they were prescient: Canada would, in the 1960s, become primarily urban. Man in the City aimed equally to develop tactics of conservation and restoration as it did to usher new building, thus anticipating a major shift in Canadian policy that would soon insist on city design in terms of rehabilitation as much as redevelopment. 70 While the first national public housing programme was created only in 1956, the federal government had, immediately following the war, accepted housing as a vital component of the new welfare state. 71 Man in the City was not only purposely illustrated, for City of Montreal authorities, in terms of works like Interbau; it was deliberately placed on sites already associated with slum clearance schemes. The projection of Canadian pavilions on land earmarked for Radio Canada followed a bitterly contested urban renewal scheme. T he intractable and ambitious Montreal politician Jean Drapeau had, during a brief stint as mayor in the mid -1950s, opposed the Habitations Jeanne Mance, a social housing venture right next to the city core, which had been mired in controversy over accusation s of English political classes, linked to the corrupt 70 H. Peter Oberlander and Arthur L. Fallick, Housing a Nation: The Evolution of Canadian Housing Policy (Vancouver: The University of British Columbia, 1992): 57. The change arose in 1964, when amendments to the 1954 National Housing Act first introduced the term \"urban renewal\". 71 The first major piece of legislation was the Housing Act of 1944. In 1946, the Canadian government create d the Central Mo rtgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a \"crown corporation\" (an entity reporting to a government minister, open to public accountability, but independent in its operations) meant to develop and implement national housing policy. 59 provincial government, preserving downtown property values by controllin g the relocation of poorer French -speaking residents (fig. 1.13). With an eye to establishing his political future, Drapeau instead proposed \"Cit\u00e9 des Ondes\" - a \"Radio City\" - to be built further east as an alternative financed, importantly, by the feder al government (fig . 1.14). Drapeau immediately lost the 1957 municipal election on the issue - though by 1960, he had retake n city hall and begu n an uninterrupted twenty -five year reign. Radio City contained no social housing; instead, it offered a middling tower -in-the-park.72 It was, however, harbinger of Drapeau's grand political ambitions resulting in massive urban transformations, always accompanied by the desire for some monumental architectural symbol, and meant to secure Montreal as an undeniably modern city. Advanced in July 1962, Man in the City was, by autumn, synonymous with the Montreal's wor ld's fair. In early September , the City of Montreal passed a resolution: \"To request the Government of Canada to make an official application to the International Bureau of Exhibitions in Paris for holding the World's Fair in Canada, in 1967, and to take steps in order that this Fair be held in Montreal.\"73 The M ontreal Citizens Committee's petitioning of the political and business classes proved decisi ve. The van Ginkels' links to 72 Andr\u00e9 Lortie, \"Montreal 1960: The Singularities of a Metropolitan Archetype\", in The 60s: Montreal Thinks Big (Montreal: Canadian Centre for Architecture; Toronto: Douglas & McIntyre, 2004): 100 -104. Drapeau wished to relocate the social housing in a new \"Cit\u00e9 Famille\", with \"garden city\" touches, to be built in the city's northern neighbourhoods along the new Metropolitan expressway. Drapeau was bitterly opposed to the 1954 Dozois Plan, which iden tified 13 redevelopment sectors including slum clearance; it would irrevocably shape Montreal's planning. Drapeau's opposition stemmed from a belief that Dozois Plan would be too \"communistic\" and it would encourage immoral behaviour in residents - a paternalism that owed to his well- orchestrated political crusades against vice and mu nicipal corruption in Montreal in the 1950s. 73 \"Extract from the minutes of a meeting of the Executive Committee of the City of Montreal, held on September 4th 1962\", Fonds Montrea l Archives. 60 the City Planning Department aided the cause. On October 9, a Canadian delegation departed for Paris. In the upcoming civic election, Drapeau, having won a second chance at the mayoralty two years earlier, campaign ed on the world's fair as a plan for Montreal's future. On October 28, he swept to power with 88 percent of the popular vote. Two weeks later, Drapeau was in Paris, awaiting a decision by the BIE. Drapeau had lobbied hard. He enlisted the favours of one Georges Marchais, a Parisian wine merchant with connections throughout European capitals and a fortune made by trafficking arms to Egypt and Saudi Arabia, who now served as the mayor's emissary to the BIE. With Marchais's fixing, Drapeau typically stayed at the R itz, a fresh sheaf of City of Montreal stationary waiting on the polished desk. 74 Photographs of van Ginkels' model - the only architectural representation of Montreal's proposal - accompanied Drapeau to Paris. The city could not have better matched the mayor's ambitions, its Haussmannian legacy - shaped also by the previous century's expositions - informing his visions of grands travaux . (Later, when faced with Montreal's economic decline, he would imperiously declare, \" Let Toronto become Milan. Montreal will always be Rome. \") For Drapeau, Montreal was to fulfill its destiny as the metropole of Quebec. His philosophy of modernisation was rooted in a uniquely Quebecois nationalistic Catholic politics and, after 1960, coloured by the Quiet Revolution, a period of sudden societal upheaval marked by the nationalisation of industry, a new provincial welfare state, secularism, and the rise of French 74 Terrance McKenna and Susan Purcell, Drapeau (Toronto and Vancouver: Clarke, Irwin & Company, 1980), 146-147. 61 s\u00e9paratisme . Man in the City - at once fantastical and realistic, embedded as it was in changes like slum clearance or t he underground city - expressed, however unwittingly, Drapeau's modernising zeal, which took urbanism as an instrument of progress and control. On November 13, 1962, the BIE awarded the 1967 Intern ational and Universal Exposition to Montreal. Delegates from thirty BIE member nations authorised the Canadian Government to begin soliciting international participation (while noting that this would be the very first officially sanctioned Category One ex hibition \"on the American continent\", a clear rebuke to the coming New York world's f air).75 Reporting from Paris, CBC radio journalists could only paraphrase the first of what became Drapeau's incessant and grand pronouncements: \"Unemployment will be ende d as Montreal sets to work to build a city within a city.\" \"It is clear that the city will be unrecognisable\", they added, \"with Mayor Drapeau wanting to turn it not only into the metropolis of Canada, but the metropolis of the world.\" The journalists pithily concluded: \"The fair will take up at least 500 acres on the island of Montreal. The exact site isn't yet known.\" 76 It was, however unintentionally, a statement on whether the tabula rasa of an exhibition site would be a matter of architectural design or political will. For the van Ginkels along with their architect allies in Montreal and elsewhere, it was a mandate . Shortly before its Christmas recess, the Canadian Parliament passed Bill C -103, 75 \"Resolution Votee par Acclamation par le Conseil the Call\", CBC News Roundup . Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (Ottawa, November 13, 1962); CBC Digital Archives, accessed May 24, 2013. 62 establishing the Canadian World Exhibition Corporation, providing a grant of $40 million, and, crucially, granting Montreal the authority to choose a proper site. The world's fair was to be equipped with public services and accessed by public transportation - placed somewhere, as an inter -governmental committee had early insisted, \"intra -muros\". 77 The City Planning Department, which the van Ginkels had done much to modernise, followed suite and recommended sites identified in Man in the City; several areas were already facing large-scale infrastructural chan ge, especially with the building of new expressways.78 Given the van Ginkels' architectural orientation, a New World city was to test CIAM theory and Team 10 correction. The dream would be short -lived. In Drapeau, the van Ginkels soon encountered a fickle patron. The mayor erred on the grandiose, exceeding the modernist temperament - the taste - of the architects. Returning from Paris, h e was to declare: \"A fair is for the masses and not for the thinkers. What the masses want are monuments.\"79 Newspapers announcing the success in Paris never really showed the van Ginkels' proposal.80 Within months, their plan faced an uncertain future. Drapeau began searching for a suitably heroic site, one unsullied by the real facts of living in the city. Later, with construction underway, 77 \"Memorandum prepared by the Federal - Provincial - Municipal group regarding the possibility of holding the 1967 International Exhibition in Montreal\" (no date; likely of Montrea l Archives, Montreal. 78 In countless early reports, the coincidental develop ment of transportation networks - whether highways or the Metro - would be projected as driving down the fair's costs. This was often a sales pitch. 79 McKenna and Purcell, Drapeau , 145. 80 Yves Jasmin, La Petite Histoire d' Expo 67 : l'Expo 67 mme e l'avez jamais vue (Montr\u00e9al: Qu\u00e9bec/Am\u00e9rique, 1997) , 54. 63 he attempt ed to erect a massive tower as the fair's symbol, even seriously pursuing a scheme to bring the Eiffel Tower - disassembled, re -erected, and then returned - to Montreal.81 At each stage , man would be made to withdraw from the city . With this, the theme , the very ethos the fair, had to change. The van Ginkels would shepherd a new round of polemical, and influential, discussions on visionary architecture and the world's fair. They organise d architects and intellectuals to redefine the exhibition - and to occupy official positions of decision -making and power. Above all, they be came the crucial to the transformation of the theme from Man in the City to Man and the World - a resounding intellectual reorientation unrecognise d in official histories . It only remained what , exactly , Expo 67 would look like. 81 The Eiffel Tower scheme was pushed by Drapeau's close friend, the caricaturist Robert LaPalme; see: Adrienne Clarkson, \"Mayor Je an Drapeau A ims for an Expo 67 T ower\", The Fifth Estate , televisio n (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, September 16, 1980). 64 Chapter 2 : Theme It is much more difficult to believe that the forms of thought which permeate all our ideas - whether these are purely theoretical or contain matter belonging to feeling, impulse, will - are means for us rather than that we serve them, that in fact they have us in their possession. What is there more in us as against them? How shall we , how shall I , set myself up as more universal than they are? G.W.F. Hegel, The Science of Logic (second edition, 1831) Your inside is out and your outside is in Your outside is in and your inside is out So come on come on The Beatles, \" Everybody' s Got Something to Hide except Me and My Monkey\" (1968) As it stood in late autumn 1962, the 1967 International and Universal Exposition was to encompass a projec t of urban renewal. Montreal would be test bed of vanguard attempts to implement - and simultaneously to reform - aspects of the \" functional city \". Urbanism was, as such , to be celebrated by all nations as both instrument and ethos of modernisation. Van Ginkels' proposed plan, Man in the City, rejected any form of an extra-muros exhibition - that is, a spectacle divorced from everyday life and its amelioration by architecture. Their distaste for the upcoming New York World's Fair - against which the Montreal exhibition was defined - was really to dismiss its self -contained fairgrounds as a commercialised divertissement . Nevertheless, they recognised perfectly the power of such miniature cities, which proposed new possibilities of spatial order that immediately formed an enviable contrast to embarrassingly inadequate existing arrangements. 1 With , or within, these short - lived events, the city could be redeemed. This utopian hope had animated the conjuring of a nineteenth -century imaginary. 1 Neil Harris, \"American Fairs and Civic Identity\", in Civic Visions, World's Fairs (Montreal: Canadian Centre for Architecture, 1993), 8. 65 Here, the grea test exhibitions, notwithstanding their innovative architectural technics, were extensions of the municipal apparatus, showcasing public infrastructures such as parks, sanitation systems, roadways, transportation, and new forms of energy that, quite litera lly, served as motors of modernity, bringing senses of the future into the grasp of mass audiences. Man in the City was equally to usher long -lasting, epochal change. As opposed to a transcendental event, however tr ansformational, of six months, Man in t he City would reshape Montreal by permanent works - for example, the proposed housing sector - compiled from world cultures, ec onomies, and political systems . The internationalism reflected the van Ginkels' sense of CIAM's civilising mission but also followed from new transatlantic relationships on city space, shelter, and design. This found, in the immediate postwar decades, a commitment by Western European and North American architects and intellectuals to urban design as a discipline. 2 With a common experience of metropolitan, industrial, capitalist societies, these designers saw the tools of city planning as the vehicle of non -revolutionary reform . The meliorative impulse assumed the authority of a technocratic welfare state, which extended its remit through urban renewal schemes - hence the calibration of Man in the City to slum clearance sites slated for federal 2 Christopher Klemek, The Transatlantic Collapse of Urban Renewal: Postwar Urbanism from New York to Berlin (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 2011), 5ff. Klemek notes that the European and North American consensus on urban design would be subject to divergent criticisms and revisions by the 1960s: for example, \"the confrontational political culture of Gr eat Britain and the United States, by comparison with West Germany and Canada, created a backlash that hobbled all manner of urban initiatives.\" 66 subsidy.3 While this liberal consensus would face often withering criticism by the end of the 1960s, Man in the City represented its zenith as a symbol of national and civic modernisation made possible by architecture design. CIAM and Team 10; city planning versus urban design; ordered spaces or ephemeral events. Montreal's transformat ion by 1967 appeared inevitable: the Canadian governmen t had committed its purse to the Centennial event, Mayor Drapeau began a new elected term by announcing massive urban change, and Man in the City stood as statement on modernist city planning . As soon as Drapeau returned from the BIE in Paris, the Quebec Association of Architects (PQAA) could declare in its monthly editorial: The mere cogitation of last month is the reality of today and we must not waste a moment to get things moving. In a relatively short space of our years, we must cram the normal growth of more than twenty years. If Montreal is to profit in every way by the International Fair, she must rejuvenate her appearance, revalorize her heritage, and proceed, without delay, to the realization of a master plan, not with the aim of stunning visitors, but with a specially designed plan for the welfare of her population. 4 Never mentioned by name, Man in the City was made the future of Montreal. Yet the closing months of 1962 would find tension between architectural aims and political ambitions. Well before the BIE's approval of the world's fair, the van Ginkels and their architect allies began manoeuvering to press an even deeper engagement on the theme . 3 Canadian governments would, in the postwar decades, or at least until the late 1970s, generally maintain a commitment to broadly progressive policies on housing and urban renewal. This held true for both Liberals and \"Red Tories\". 4 Gilles Marchand, \"Message from the P.Q.A.A.: Gone is the Time for Imponderables\", Architecture, B \u00e2timent, Construction (Montreal, November 1962): 23. Marchand was the Honorary Secretary of the PQAA. 67 In these debates on how, exactly, to constitute an exhibition, Man in the City would be displac ed, made to yield to the seemingly greater concerns of Man and His World - a suggestion, well before its consecration as leitmotif of the Montreal exposition , of both programmatic advance and retreat: on the one hand, demonstrating the architects' growing preoccupation with imbuing the world's fair by a more universalising spirit of symbolising the communion of peoples and nations, now registered in the move from city to world ; on the other hand, indicating a diminishing horizon of expectation, with urban d esign inevitably yielding to architecture qua architecture. A THEME \"Group Urges New Formula\". \"'New Look' In Fairs Urged\". Only weeks after Jean Drapeau's triumphant return from Paris, and just shy of the Canadian Parliament's Royal Assent, Montreal ne wspapers announced a radical elaboration on the future world's fair: Montreal can open a new era in international exhibitions in 1967 by staging a World's Fair based on co -operation between nations rather than national competition. This is the core of a new and important World's Fair concept formulated here in recent weeks by a group of local architects, planners and interested citizens.... This can be achieved by rejecting the standard type of World's Fair dominated by national pavilions.... What the committee has in mind is a Fair composed primarily of international pavilions, each illustrating a distinct theme.... The international pavilions would illustrate the problems, aspirations, needs, environment, spirit and family of modern man. 5 The \"concept\" was, unsurprisingly, t he handiwork of the van Ginkels working once again 5 Peter Desbarats, \"Group Urges New Formula\", The Montreal Star (December 10, 1962). 68 under the auspices of the Montreal Citizens' Committee (MCC) . It followed a PQAA meeting , held in late November 1962, on discussing a confidential report by the van Ginkels, their friend and sponsor Michel Chevalier of the MCC, and a few architect allies .6 The small group had first met a month earlier. D espite the upcoming BIE review of Montreal official bid for the world's fair , the architects suddenly shifted focus with a conjecture ev en more schematic - that is, without any architectural rendering - than Man in the City. O nce again, they envisioned an entirely new kind of international exhibition: Montreal '67 should represent a return to the spirit of the International Exhibitions of a century ago. This means complete adherence to a universally applicable theme. MAN AND HIS WORLD is a theme of such scope as to interest all people and encourage the participation of all nations. However, in its strength as a theme of universal appe al, also lies its weakness. In the comprehensive scope of the theme there lies a danger of focus. This would defeat the intention of effecting an exchange of ideas in a manner which could be internationally stimulating and profitable. A positive reactio n can be achieved only if there is a basis of comparison between exhibits - otherwise universality is lost. For this reason, and also to make quite clear the intended spirit of the exhibition, the theme should be divided into major components. 7 The stil l undefined architecture was still to follow the imperative of a theme - or, suddenly , 6 The architects were Roy Le Moyne, Raymond Affleck, and Hazen Lebensold, Sise, an important Montreal office that had begun advancing large-scale works exhibiting a refined brutalism and, later, megastructural overtones; the projects would shape Canadian architectural discourse in the 1960s. Sise had worked for Le Corbusier in the early 1930s and attended the fourth CIAM meeting that produced The Athens Charter in July 1933. He had also joined the famed Canadian surgeon Norman Bethune in Madrid during the Spanish Civil War, sym pathising with the \"Loyalists\" while driving a Red Cross ambulance; the experience marked Sise's lifelong commitment to social justice. 7 R. Affleck, Michel A21-13, Fonds van Ginkel, Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal. 69 themes , extending beyond the limits of city to more existential notions on problems , aspirations , needs , environment , spirit , and a family comprising the totality of \"mo dern man\". The confidential memorandum drew on popular precedent. The very last subject purpos ely evoked The Family of Man , the photography exhibition first shown in 1955 at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and still touring the world in 1962, en route to stopping in thirty -seven countries on six continents; more than nine million would view it, with countless others discovering its images either in the bestselling book of the same name or by a 26-minute documentary film that was translated into 22 languages and screened in more than 70 countries in 1957 alone.8 Curated by the famed photographer Edward Steichen, the exhibition followed his belief in photography as a universal language - and mass medium - suited to making \"an affirmative contribution to life\" by giving \"abstract meanings to very literal photographs\" (fig. 2.1 ).9 The project was political - not least owing to Steichen's directing of aerial surveys for the American military during both world wars and his resulting conviction that photographic images could be tools of peace - but ahistorical: the collected photographs , enlarg ed without respecting original sizes and installed for an overall effect, were accompanied by texts from world religions, folk sayings and literature, all to project a post -nationalist post -religious nuclear world and, at times, a triumphalism in the 8 Blake Stimson, The Pivot of the World: Photography and Its Nation (Cambridge MA: The MIT Press, 2006), 65. 9 Edward Steichen quoted in Monique Berlier, \"Re adings of The Family of Man \", in Bonnie Brennan and Hanno Hardt, Picturing the Past: Media, History and Photography (Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1999), 210. From 1947 to 1962, Steichen was director of the Photography Department at th e Museum of Modern Art. 70 face of Cold War adversity. (Under the auspices of the United States Information Agency, which also managed American participation in world's fairs, the exhibition toured the world for eight years and was shown at the American National Exhibition in Moscow, si te of the famous \"kitchen debate\" between then Vice -President Richard Nixon and the Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev. 10) The Family of Man had an enormous popular appeal, its images meant to create optimistic narratives of a wellspring of human feeling and achievement in the face of international division and domestic insecurity (not least race relations or the paranoia of McCarthyism). Yet leading intellectuals condemned the exhibition as trite, middlebrow, and kitsch - or as the young critic Hilton Krame r scornfully put it, \"a self -congratulatory means for obscuring the urgency of real problems under a blanket of ideology which takes for granted the essential goodness, innocence, and moral superiority of the international 'little man,' 'the man in the str eet,' the abstract, disembodied hero of a world -view which regards itself as superior to mere politics\" . 11 The view was echoed on the other side of the Atlantic by Roland Barthes, who, noting the reworked title The Great Family of Man upon 10 Stimson, The Pivot of the World: Photography and Its Nation , 64, 66. The United States Information Agency would conclude that, among the massive display of American culture and technology, the Family of Man had the strongest impa ct on Soviet audiences. See: Jack Masey and Conway Lloyd Morgan, Cold W ar Confrontations: US Exhibitions and Their R ole in the Cultural C old War (Baden Switzerland: Lars M \u00fcller Publishers, 2008) , 248-249. In 1945, Steichen had produced Power in the Pacif ic, a photographic exhibition that followed the Road to Victory show he had created in 1942; the successful exhibitions served to boost morale in the war effort. In 1951, Steichen organised Korea - the Impact of War in Photographs . He believed that all the exhibitions would help viewers hate warfare but admitted failing in his attempt. See: Monique Berlier, \"Readings of The Family of Man \", in Brennan and Hardt, Picturing the Past: Media, History and Photography , 211; Fred Turner, \" The Family of Man and the Politics of Attention in Cold War America\", Public Culture 24:1 (2012): 58 -59. 11 Hilton Kramer, \"Exhibiting the Family of Man\", Commentary (October 1955): 367. 71 the exhibition's opening in Paris, summarily dismissed \"all this Adamism\".12 The ecumenical project was seen as moralising. The Montreal architects shared little of this criticism. Man and His World was considered in the terms of The Family of Man precisely to evoke perc eptions of a fraternal order arising outside of politics and by aesthetic means. The Family of Man installation, designed by Paul Rudolph (who had studied under Walter Gropius at Harvard), offered an array of images, displayed in various sizes, hung at different heights, seen at all angles, with multiple pathways allowing visitors to fashion individual and intimate narratives while navigating a plethora of world peoples and cultures. The contrived internationalism resonated with a Canadian mindset marked by diplomat and Nobel laureate Lester B. Pearson's definition of Canada as a \"middle power\" brokering new kinds of international alliances between Cold War polarities. Pearson, who would become Prime Minister in 1963, thus committing his Liberal governmen t to the world's fair, had played instrumental roles in founding both the United Nations and NATO. ( Upon leaving office in 1968, Pearson would deliver the important BBC Reith Lectures , which he titled \"Peace in the Family of Man\". 13) Indeed, it was the pa cific, moral order symbolised by the UN that allowed the van Ginkels to imagine this most modern of political organisations participating in the \"promotion for the Fair with a concept as outlined\", using its \"special agencies and other 12 Roland Barthes, \"The Great Family of Man\" (1957), in Mythologies (New York: Hill and Wang , 1972), 100 - 102. Believed the exhibition \"removes History\", Barthes argued against the apparently apolitical contextualisation of things like \"work\" as \"natural\" instead of \"profitable\". 13 Lester Pearson, Peace in th e Family of Man (London: British Broa dcasting Corporation, 1969). 72 international organizations whose interests would parallel the selected components of the theme.\"14 The gesture of telescoping from man to world was implied by closing pages in The Family of Man book, with portraits of husbands and wives accompanied by the caption \"We two for m a multitude\" followed, however accidently, by a spread showing the United Nations General Assembly in session ( fig. 2.2). The didactic foreshortening of cultures, peoples, and nations found one reviewer favourably describing The Family of Man as an innovative \"theme show\" that \"fuses science, photography, architecture, layout and writing into a compelling synthesis.\"15 The utopian ambition was to project the endeavours of \"man\" outside political limits. Thus did one Henry Strub, a senior executive at Alcan (the Aluminium Company of Canada), when solicited for ideas on Man and His World , provide a remarkably prescient meditation of the future fair, in which \"Exhibitors would be invited to use space in buildings provided by the exhibition authorities and to use smaller rather than larger spaces so that there would be no occasion for Australia, which is large but sparsely population, to have a larger or smaller exhibit than Holland, which is small but densely populated.\" 16 The premise tied the architectural - an elimination of competing national 14 Affleck, Chevalier, et al., \"1967 Montreal World's Fair\", 4. 15 Barbara Morgan, \"The Theme Show: a Contemporary Exhibition Technique (1955), quoted in Turner, \" The Family of Man and the Politics of Attention in Cold War Amer ica\", 82. 16 Henry E. Strub, \"World Fair - Montreal - 1967\" (26 October 1962): Sise, van Ginkel , Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal . In the early 1960s, Alcan was active in promoting d esign in Quebec; Strub was central to petitioning the Quebec government in this regard and represented a nexus between corporations and industrial design and the arts. See: Martin Racine, \"The Ambiguous Modernity of Julien H\u00e9bert\", Richman Kenneally and Johanne Sloan, eds., Expo 67: Not Just a Souvenir (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2010) , 101, and R\u00e9jean Legault, ed., Norma n Slater: Design Lessons (Montreal: Centre de Design de l'Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, 2011). With the planning of Expo 67 underway by 1963, Daniel van Ginkel would include Strub as a member 73 pavilions - to the political - a rearrangement of countries by thematic comparison and not geopolitical reach . The confidential report, steered by the van Ginkels, was decisive. Once again the intellectual work of ar chitects was to define avant la lettre , ahead of the BIE decision, the very terms and conditions of the exhibition. The appellation \"Montreal '67\" shortly became Expo 67 and Man and His World its well-known theme. Even when later shorn of its polemical o rigins, the broadly humanistic appeal would offer refuge to nations and corporations wishing to express sentiments of global fraternity in 1967. The plan was no longer to remake Montrea l but to re -present the world. An insistence on the \"comparison betwe en things\" was to oppose a typical form of representation: \"The national pavilion as such has no place in a true international exhibition.\" 17 The idea - that through architecture the world could be situated outside geopolitics - would animate every aspect of the van Ginkels' future designs. This followed trends in twentieth -century world's fairs toward themes over industrial displays.18 The encyclopedic dimension, which architecture would soon be made to define, was a parsing of of a consulting committee for his invaluable \"knowledge of foreign and local artists\"; see: H.P. Daniel van Ginkel, \"Memorandum to Mr Claude Robillard, Director of Planning and Development, Canadian World Exhibition Corporation\" (May 9, 1963): 2, Series 27 -A21-03, Fonds van Ginkel, Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal Affleck, Chevalier, et al., \"1967 Montreal World's Fair\", 18 van Wesemael of In struction and Delight: A Socio -historical Analysis of World a Phenomenon (1798 -1851- 1970) (Rotterdam: Uitgeverij 010, 200), 22- The van Ginkels and their architect allies noted: \"By the end of the 19th century, industry was no l onger a source of wonder.... If the international exhibition is to survive as a medium for the exchange of ideas, if it is to be a potent force in international affairs - it must find a new raison d'\u00eatre.\" See: Affleck, Chevalier, et al., \"1967 Montreal Wo 1. 74 knowledge as well as a defi nition of society - the family of man - as an organic entity made the basis of the exhibition. Categories like problems or needs or environments were to be constructed by contrasting a multitude of objects collected from around the world, at times shorn o f their national characters, and reassembled to comprise a greater inventory of humankind. The theme proposed seeing elements of human culture in terms of their relations to an overarching system. The world exhibition was to make intelligible these interrelations. BORROWINGS Here lay a mediation of history. Like the van Ginkels' earlier plans, the shift toward Man and His World opened with a discourse on nineteenth century expositions . With origins in \"the time when the shift from handwork to machine production made itself obvious\", the great exhibitions - 1851, 1867, 1889 - \"left an indelible mark on our environment - not only in their stimulus to industry, but in their innovations in engineering, construction and architecture.\" 19 In the \"very complete surveys\", the voluminous official reports describing and jus tifying each exhibition upon its close, was discovered \"a contemporary realization of their unique importance\". Both phenomena, aesthetic and bureaucratic, were evidence of an admirable self -awareness of history and modernity. To emphasise these heroic events was to construct precedents of the present. In reimagining world's fairs, the Montreal architects, led by the van Ginkels, unwittingly 19 Affleck, Chevalier, et al., \"1967 Montreal World's Fair\", 1. 75 echoed the philosopher Walter Benjamin's argument, m ade a quarter century earlier, on finding sources of modern life in the ferro-vitreous innovations of an earlier epoch: the Parisian arcades of the 1820s, Charles Fourier's Phalanst \u00e8re, or the \"phantasmagoria\" of the world exhibitions.20 Benjamin sought \"r esidues\" of past forms - often works of engineering - that, freed from their original function, could be repositioned alongside similar objects into a new configuration, thus to challenge the qualities of contemporary life.21 He had, in fact, celebrated exactly the kinds of long -span structures recalled by van Ginkels; as opposed to \"artistic\" architecture, he privileged \"engineering\" architecture and argued that in things like the Eiffel Tower, with its vertiginous effects (seen especially in photographs), there had arisen a new social condition : \"the magnificent vistas of the city provided by the new construction in iron... for a long time were reserved exclusively for the workers and engineers\" - two agents of modernity uniquely armed with a privileged aerial view, floating above the world (and, it seemed, history), with a perch on the future , \"that alone made it possible to recognize that was new and decisive about these structures: the feeling of space\". 22 Benjamin's discovery of aesthico-technical bases o f a classless society in nineteenth -century 20 Walter Benjamin, \"Paris, Capital of the Nineteenth Century\" (1935), in Peter Demetz, Reflections: Benjamin, The Arcades Project , trans. Howard Eiland and Kevin McLaughlin (Cambridge MA: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1999). The Arcades Project , unfinished upon Benjamin's death in 1940, was a representation and critiqu e of the nineteenth century and bourgeois life; it includes \"Expose of 1939\", a revision of his seminal \"Paris, Capital of the Nineteenth Century\". 21 David Frisby, Fragments of Modernity: Theories of Modernity in the Work of Simmel, Kracauer and Benjamin (Cambridge MA: The MIT Press, 1986), 226 -227. 22 Benjamin, The Arcades Project , 459, 156; Detlef Mertins, \"Walter Benjamin and the Tectonic as an Optical Instrument\", in Modernity Unbound (London: Architectural Association, 2011), 118, 122, 127- 128. 76 architectural phenomena owed to a careful reading of Sigfried Giedion's canonical book Building in France, Building in Iron, Building in Ferroconcrete published in 1928. Writing on the eve of his immersion in CI AM but having already embraced modernism ( which stemmed from a visit to the 1923 Bauhaus Exhibition in Weimar), Giedion consciously tied avant - garde expressions of the 1920s to heroic experiments in iron of the past century; in so doing, he opposed constru ction to architecture: Aside from a certain haut-go\u00fbt charm the artistic drapery of the past century has become musty. What remains unfaded of the architecture is those rare instances when construction breaks through.... Construction in nineteenth century plays the role of the subconscious. Outwardly, construction still boasts the old pathos; underneath, concealed behind facades, the basis of our present existence is taking shape. 23 Benjamin deeply admired the passage. He tried, in a manner following Freu d's characterisation of dreams, also to conjure \"wish -fulfilling images\" that \"direct the visual imagination, which has been activated by the new, back to the primeval past\" - or, as Giedion put it when describ ing the modern historian's task, \"to extract f rom the vast complexity of the past those elements that will be the point of departure for the future.\" 24 Despite reservations on the \"phantasmagoria\" - the spectacle of commodities and 23 Sigfried Giedion, Building in France, Building in Iron, Building in Ferroconcrete (1928; Santa Monica CA: The Getty Centre for the History of Art and the Humanities, 1995), 87. 24 Benjamin, \"Paris, Capital of the Nineteenth Cen tury\", 148; Giedion, Building in France, Building in Iron, Building in Ferroconcrete , 85; Mertins, \"Walter Benjamin and the Tectonic Unconscious: Using as an Optical Instrument\", 115- 116, 124- 125.

Benjamin wrote to Giedion immediately and admitted being \"electrified\" by it given \"my own related investigations\" - likely a reference to his Passagen -Werk (Arcades Project ), which he had initi ated a year earlier.

The new iron constructions were to usher new forms of socialisation, and vice versa . It was an argument not only on architectural form but for mass culture. The projection of the Montreal world's fair in the technics of past great exhibitions borrowed directly from Giedion. The van Ginkels' polemic adopted Giedion's urgent view on the past - namely, that previous aesthetic and social forms cou ld figure in society's present conception of itself and its future possibilities. Man in the City and Man and His World would bear the influence of Giedion's first major work, Space, Time and Architecture : The Growth of a New Tradition , published in 1941, reissued in five enlarged editions with numerous impressions, translated into eight languages, and forcefully shaping what constituted modern architecture for a generation. Arising from lectures given as the Charles Eliot Norton Professor at Harvard in 1 938-1939, and drawing on his training in both mechanical engineering and art history, Giedion's book, as its subtitle suggested, appealed to a zeitgeist by identifying in parallel disciplines - architecture and urbanism, science and technology - developments dovetailing in shared senses of space -time , a thesis provocatively expressed in illustrations juxtaposing, say, Picasso's cubist paintings, Edgerton's stroboscopic photographs revealing moving phenomena imperceptible to the human eye (fig. 2.3). 25 In modern architecture , the 25 Martin S. James, \"Giedion, Sigfried\", in Adolf K. Placzek, ed., Macmillan Encyclopedia of Architecture Vol. 2 (London: The Free Press, 1982), 200; Harry Francis Mallgrave, Modern Architectural Theory: A Historical Survey, 1673- 1968 (Cambridge UK: Cambridge University Press, 2005), 324 -325. 78 new concept of space - cubist, anti-perspectival - was its simultaneity, dynamism, transparency, and \"new vision\", polemically captured in Laszlo Mohol y-Nagy's jacket design for Building in France that used Giedion's negative photograph of a pont transbordeur , issued from the dematerialising effects of the previous century's ferro- vitreous structures (fig. 2.4 ).27 It reflected a modern consciousness of t he penetration into \"things\" achieved in the natural and human sciences (whether the x -ray or psychoanalysis). Visualised in this manner, the iron architectures of the great exhibitions released, in Giedion's eyes, \"the new potentialities in construction, the use of mass production in industry, the changed organization of society\"; in so doing, the structures represented \"constituent facts\": \"those tendencies which, when they are suppressed, inevitably Hence the van Ginkels' periodisation : \"Mo ntreal '67\" was to be placed within the transformative effects of the nineteenth -century exhibitions and against the aesthetic and spiritual exhaustion of twentieth -century fairs. \"Constituent facts\" would again be summoned in the cause of modernism, with a new \"space -time\" felt, in Lemco van Ginkel's view, in the effects of the automobile (and superhighway) or atomic energy - not in their 26 Hilde Heynen, Architecture and Modernity: A Critique (Cambridge MA: The MIT Press, 1999), 33, 40. 27 Moholy-Nagy's Von Material zu Architektur (1928), based on his Bauhaus Vorkurs , was retitle d The New Vision upon its English publications in 1930 and 1947. As Sokratis Georgiadis observes: \"Equipped with the visual apparatus of modern man - formed and educated, above all, through the study of Cubism and Neoplasticism - he [Giedion] wanders thro ugh his objects in cinematographic fashion.\" Building in France would instill in Giedion a lifelong pursuit of architectural photography. See: Georgiadis, \"Introduction\", in Sigfried Giedion, Building in France, Building in Iron, Building in Ferroconcret e (1928; Santa Monica CA: The Getty Centre for the History of Art and the Humanities, 1995), 43. 28 Sigfried Giedion, Space, Time and Architecture: The Growth of a New Tradition (Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press, 1956, third edition), 18. 79 outward destructiveness but, as The Family of Man had offered, by some inner pacific equilibrium waiting to be harness ed. Thus the PQAA's swift endorsement of the new world's fair plan: \"Montreal wants to be at the nuclear time, but through peaceful undertakings meant to revalorize the dignity of man.\"29 Extending Giedion's teleology, such revalorisation was the exclusiv e domain of architecture. Man and His World owed an additional philosophical debt. Aside from his canonical account of modern architecture, Giedion's discourse was hardly alien to the van Ginkels . Not only had Lemco van Ginkel worked with Giedion on CIA M 6 in Bridgewater, England, but she had begun studying architecture at McGill exactly during its embrace of modernism at the very moment that saw the publication of Space, Time and Architecture ; moreover, she later initiated a CIAM chapter in Philadelphia (at the behest of Jacqueline Tyrwhitt, who had worked with Giedion) and continued to encounter Giedion during visits to Harvard in the 1950s. The discursive influence lasted. In 1959, when invited by the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, to propose an exhibition on Canadian design, the van Ginkels advanced a thesis on the transformation of daily life by objects bearing the creative and functional criteria of concept , production , and use whether at the scale of the tool or the city. 30 The unrealised exhibition, 29 Marchand , \"Message from the P.Q.A.A.: Gone is the Time for Imponderables\", 23. The van Ginkels' report on \"Man and the World\" was discussed at PQAA meetings on November 23 and 27, 1962. 30 H.P. Daniel van Ginkel and Blanche Lemco van Ginkel, \"Draft Prospectus for a Design Exhibition: for Central and Mortgage and Housing Corporation\" (May 4, 1959): 5. Created in 1946, CMHC was a \"crown corporation\" ( an entity reporting to a government minister, open to public accountability, but independent in its operations) meant to help implement and develop national housing policy. 80 imagined at the size of a city square, was to be organised by a series of linked pavilions through which visitors proceeded \"either systemically or whimsically\". The circuit, which suggested the open -ende d installation of The Family of Man , lead to several sections - \"Tradition\", \"Function\" (rendered in characteristically Team - with the largest one devoted to \"Space -Time\" defined as \"relativity, metamorphosis, transition, interpenetration, intangible content, reflection, simultaneity\" and evoked accordingly: A glass wall between indoor and outdoor space on continuous floor surface; beside it a photo display of the same wall under different conditions - transparency opacity reflection simultaneity Or: Space -time in the city - a series of photographs to stimulate the unfolding view of building, looking up to the tower, looking down from it into the squar e And: Continuum - the cycle of water (rain, river, sea, cloud) of energy of vegetable (oak and acorn) of mineral Physics - time -space in the Foucauld [ sic] pendulum Architecture - the spacial [ sic] relationship of buildings - the rowhouse as single en tity and 81 as group entity, simultaneously31 The list continued. The aesthetic links between natural and human made, biological and mechanical, or organic and artificial reflected Giedion's programmatic and pastoral concept of modernity, one contingent on t he active subject moving in space and time.32 Modernity was to be experienced by a kind of collective gestalt felt in the effects of constructions made of new synthetic materials. This materialist, sachlich , view animated the van Ginkels. Aside from ou tlining an exhibition, their CMHC proposal, couched in Giedion, was a statement on bringing Canadian cultural development in line with ascendant artistic and technical tendencies of the age. The sentiment crystallised, somewhat oddly, in an opening three -page free verse poem: This is Canada Power from an abundance of water Energy in coal and oil Harbours on two great oceans Wheat, timber and cattle Iron, zinc, and lead, gold and uranium The land is rich Up the rivers we built a thousand towns A thousand m ore followed the railway across the great plains .....and north now on the air routes, .... Mechanization took command New technology bore newer technology Goods of all kinds for all people Medical magic lengthens the life -span More people, more goods, more pr oductivity, more leisure 31 Ibid., 14. 32 Heynen, Modernity Unbound (London: Arc hitectural Association, 2011): 49. 82 In describing the exploitation of natural resources, industry and mass production, science and progress, prosperity, automation, insalubrity, and finally culminating in the coming redemption of the city, stanzas would repeatedly turn on the phrase \"Mechanization Took Command\" - an evocation of Giedion's book Mechanization Takes Command , his remarkable \"contribution to anonymous history\" published in 1948, which reread modernity through non -architectural but engineered objects in a bid to reclaim \"human needs\" (whether in light of Taylorism or the horrific destruction wrought by the recent world war) . 33 The poem appropriated Giedion's title to map simultaneously the phenomena of modernity and a rise of Canadian modernisation. The v an Ginkels' thus proposed exhibiting the kinds of objects covered in Giedion's survey: not simply design objects but all the instruments of progress, from furniture to machines, shaping the built environment. Yet it was in the van Ginkels' repeated invoca tion in their proposal of the term \"interpenetration\" - a keyword in Giedion's lexicography of modernity (and modernisation) - that a spatial ideal emerged. Giedion had, in Building in France , defined interpenetration (Durchdringung through the ferro -vitreous technics that gave sensations of motion and experience s of intermingling space; this , in turn, presaged a new emancipatory social reality. 34 The view was evocatively rendered in Space, Time and Architecture : 33 Sigfried Giedion , Mechanization Takes Command: A Contribution to Anonymous History (New York: W.W. Norton, 1948). 34 Heynen, Architecture and the Reception of Cubism in Germany\", 44 -47. 83 The volume of free space included by the 1889 Galerie des Machines represented an entirely unprecedented conquest of matter.... And it is not as a building circumscribed within definite limits that the Galerie des Machines is important. The girders in its skeleton could have been either more or less numerous without thereby effecting any distinctive alteration. The aesthetic meaning of this hall is contained in the union and interpenetration of the building and outer space, out of which there grows a completely new limitlessness and movement in keeping with the machines it contains. 35 Again, the implication was of the interpenetration of new forms of construction and social life. This was also to allow historical epochs to breach one another - not in style but as ethic . Giedion saw a single vast evolutionary pattern underlying architecture, developing linearly, and culminating in modernism. 36 Accordingly, and prophetically, modern architecture could, in its perfection, right the wrongs of the past: If our culture shoul d be destroyed by brutal forces - or even if it should be terrorized by them - then the nineteenth century will have to be judged as having misused men, materials, and human thought, as one of the most wretched periods. If we prove capable of putting to their right use the potentialities which were handed down to us, then the nineteenth century, in spite of the human disorder it created and in spite of the consequences which are still developing out of it, will grow into new and heroic dimensions. 37 The ca ll, made at the start of the crucial chapter on \"The Evolution of New Potentialities\", which showcased the nineteenth -century exhibitions, resonated with a generation fac ing nuclear holocaust, to say nothing of the past ravages of world war. Despite aesth etic and 35 Giedion, Space, Time and Architecture , 268 -269, emphasis added. 36 Kenneth Frampton, \"Giedion in America: Reflections in a Mirror\", Architectural Design 51, 6/7 (1981): 45 - 51; Heynen, Architecture and Mo dernity: A Critique, 35. Frampton argues that Giedion stubbornly resisted dialectical materialism as a theory of history. Heynen notes that a s a historiographical approach, Giedion's model was non -dialectical, standing for a weakening of hierarchical mod els on all levels. 37 Giedion, Space, Time and Architecture , 162. 84 technical advance , \"the equilibrium that went out of human life with the coming of the Industrial Revolution has not been restored to this day.\"38 Yet works like the Galerie des Machines offered a key to modern aesthetics : \"the play of enormous forces is held in equilibrium, an equilibrium that is floating rather than rigid\": It is the equilibrium of a balance beam daringly poised against continually varying forces. A new oscillating harmony is created An elastic counterpoise is achieved which ab sorbs changes in the interior, the exterior, and the foundation. This counterpoise adjusts itself to fluctuations of the ground. An equilibrium is achieved against changes in the molecular structure of the building itself. An equilibrium is achieved against external pressure, wind, and snow. Construction passes over into expression. 39 The inventory of material improvement was equally to suggest social progress. Equilibrium , oscillation , or counterpoise: in each instance, the interpenetration of material, spatial, and temporal forces - \"constituent facts\" to be awakened from the slumber of history - was to 38 Ibid., 163. 39 Ibid., 273. On one hand, Giedion saw structures like the Galerie des Machines as almost enchanted, at least in their \"space -time\" effects. On the other hand, he was utter ly sanguine when faced with the sachlich effect on social reality. As he would note in a brilliant aside on Edgar Degas's painting The Dancer : \"Degas, the most daring experimentalist among the painters of the period and the exact contemporary of Eiffel, p rojects his dancers stripped of all erotic fa\u00e7ade. He shows their distended nostrils and all the tenseness of straining effort. Max Lieberman remarks (in 'Pan', the most 'precious' of the German avant -garde reviews, p. 195) that 'he seems to disguise his models and to see the nascent prostitute in the young dancer: no other painter has so completely subdued the novelistic element.' This painting exhibits in its field the impersonal, precise, and objective spirit which produced constructions like the Galerie des Machines\" (271). 85 spur the dis -alienation of \"man\" (from the city, from history).40 Hence the universalising ideal of the van Ginkels' CMHC exhibition proposal now pas sing through Man in the City and leading directly to Man and His World: the construction of a transcendent modernist imaginary, evoked through the unifying force of a Zeitgeist , was here to challenge a sclerotic Canadian architectural modernism especially given the country's otherwise robust technological modernisation and, importantly, young history. One crucial borrowing still remained. Lemco van Ginkel had, with Aldo van Eyck, assisted Giedion on preparing a presentation on \"Architectural Expression\" at CIAM 6, held in Bridgewater, England, in 1947.41 The discussion extended Giedion's interest in a \"New Monumentality\", which he had outlined only a few years earlier in collaboration with the painter Fernand L\u00e9ger and the architect Josep Llu\u00eds Sert. L\u00e9ger, Sert, and Giedion argued for public spectacles and civic centres - \"the expression of man's highest cultural needs\" - as necessary components of democratic institutions during postwar reconstruction. Drawing on his interpenetration and space -time , Giedion believed that the aesthetics of monumentality were foreshadowed by the spatial and plastic conceptions of Picasso, L\u00e9ger, Arp, and Mir\u00f2 but also had to flow from the \"emotional life of the community\" that could only arise in face-to -face contact (and no t via radio or television). 42 These places were best realised in 40 Elsewhere, Giedion employed terms like interrelation, hovering , and penetration . 41 For a synopsis 6 debate on \"Architectural Expression\", see: Giedion, A Decade of New Girsberger, 1951), 30 -37. 42 Sigfried Giedion, \"The Need for a New Monumentality\", in Paul Zucker, ed., New Architecture and City Planning (1944; Freeport NY: Books for Libraries Press, 1971), 556ff; Eric Mumford, The CIAM Discourse on 86 comm unity centres and public plazas, an image Giedion derived from his experience of crowds among the pavilions at the 1937 Paris Exposition and the 1939 New York World's Fair: \"great spectac les capable of seemingly ephemeral, Sert, L\u00e9ger, and Giedion actually gave such spaces an architectural contour: Today modern architects know that buildings cannot be conceived as isolated units, that they have to be incorporated into the vaster urban schemes. There are no frontiers between architecture and town planning, just as there are no frontiers between the city and the region. Co-relation between them is necessary. Monuments should constitute the most powerful acc ents in these vast schemes.... A new step lies ahead. Postwar changes in the whole economic structure of nations may bring with them the organization of community life in the city which has been practically neglected up to date.... Modern materials and new techniques are at hand: light metal structures; curved, laminated wooden arches; panels of different textures, colours, and sizes; light elements like ceilings which can be suspended from big trusses covering practically unlimited spans. Mobile elements c an constantly vary the aspect of the buildings. These mobile elements, changing positions and casting different shadows when acted upon by wind or machinery, can be the source of new architectural effects. During night hours, color and forms can be proj ected on vast surfaces. Such displays could be projected upon buildings for purposes of publicity or propaganda. These buildings would have large plane surfaces planned for this purpose, surfaces which are nonexistent today. 44 Urbanism 1928- 1960 (Cambrid ge MA: The MIT Press, 2002), 151ff; Joan Ockman, Architecture Culture 1943 -1968 (New York: Columbia Books on Architecture and Rizzoli, 1993), 27 -28. 43 Giedion, \"The Need for a New Monumentality\", 568. 44 J.

The full manifesto would be published only a decade later, thus returning it to postwar architectural debate an d resting on Giedion's authority with the third edition of Space, Time and Architecture published in 1956; see: Giedion, Architecture, You and Me (Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press, 1958), 48 -52. 87 The new forms followed Gie dion's reach into the nineteenth century: on the one hand, inorganic, synthetic materials creating an interpentration of planes, forms, and surfaces to give impressions of coincident \"space -time\"; on the other hand, the technics of long -span structures cap able of housing a mass public (fig. 2.5). The van Ginkels' 1959 design exhibition read similarly: \"the exhibition must be considered as being one design\"; pavilions were to possess a similar structural and material system as well as a modular design but \" have a different aspect and character through the use of different wall and panel materials and a very positive use of colour\"; and the ensemble would, notably, be set in a \"large space open space with a number of buildings grouped around it - like a city square.\" 45 Their proposal respected Giedion's call for \"emotional training\" in the postwar world, thus to \"humanize the industrialization of the building process through architectonic form\"; a different rhetorical quality could, therefore, be given in the suggestion of ever -changing - \"mobile\" - environments of panelised forms and moving colours. 46 At the same time, it fulfilled a CIAM maxim on \"The Heart of the City\": \"Urbanism is the framework within which architecture and other plastic arts must be integ rated to perform once more a social function \"; the aim was to create the symbols of community within an urban framework that was still rationalistic. 47 As such , the van Ginkels' 1959 CMHC report foreshadowed the 45 van Ginkel and Lemco van Ginkel, \"Draft Prospectus f or a Design Exhibition: for Central and Mor tgage and Housing Corporation\", 8. 46 Giedion, \"The Need J.L. Sert, and E.N. Rogers, eds., \"A Short Outline of the Core\", in The Heart of the City: Towards the Huma nisation of Urban Life (London: Lund Humpheries, 1952), 168; Alan Colquhoun, Modern Architecture (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000) , 218-219. Colquhoun notes that Team 10 opposed New 88 social function assumed of both Expo 67 and the Canadian Centennial: an exhi bition as \"its own environment\" and a national event shaping public sentiment by occurring in several cities simultaneously. Such an enterprise, the van Ginkels knew, could only result from an enl ightened administrative fo rce. Again, they drew on the lessons of past exhibitions. The ir first outlin e of Man and His World recalled, pace Giedion, \"the supervision of men who possessed real foresight and initiative\" - qualities embodied by Michel Chevalier (\"who worked tireless ly to promote industry\"), the polytechnicien , statesman, and -Simonist responsible for the 1867 Paris Exposition.48 (\"The Saint-Simonians: a salvation army in the midst of the bourgeoisie\", Walter Benjamin once noted when compiling notes on Chevalier and the expositions universelles .49) Coincidently evoking the namesake of their friend and world's fair interlocutor Michel Chevalier of the Montreal Citizens Committee, the van Ginkels and their architect colleagues insisted, ahead of the BIE decision , on a uniquely \"non -managerial\" governing body for the world's fair: One great weakness of the recent fairs is that they lacked an overall design concept.... A strong idea concept is the first step to achieving a strong design concept and an exhibition which has truly international validity. This would require a rather special coordinating function within the Monumentality: whereas the latter \"accepted architecture as a media ted representation, the other sought a primal language in which form and meaning would be one.\" This was not entirely true for the van Ginkels, who were in a position to borrow from (and contribute to) both camps . Moreover, Team 10 (and the van Ginkels) drew inspiration from Le Corbusier's rationalist urban theory. 48 The van Ginkels' mention of Chevalier, while neglecting to note his Saint -Simonianism, followed Giedion's description in Space, Time and Architecture . 49 Benjamin, The Arcades Project , 594. 89 administrative structure of the exhibition design board, possibly made up of people drawn from the appropriate professions and disciplines, either an a ll-Canadian group, or including members from other parts of the world.... Its role would be solely to settle problems of design as related to the theme and concept.... The danger is, as with all non -managerial functions, that it will be lost sight of as the administrative structure is developed. 50 The synthesis of \"idea\" (theme) and \"design\" (architecture) was to be matched in an administrative scheme rejecting typical demands to organise a multiplicity of national and commercial interests, thereby opposing any fragmentation - by competing displays - of \"man\" and the \"world\". Here, an artistic vanguard was to supplant the admired example of technical elites at the helm of the nineteenth -century exhibitions; the animating spirit evoked, however accidentally, Saint -Simon's dictum that modern society would pass \"from the government of men to the administration of things\". \"Man and His World\" implicitly echoed the sentiment that world history was social (without being paternal). This was, in a sense, a statem ent on power. In raising the new theme Man and His World, t he van Ginkels and their architect allies defined a role for the public intellectual. Traditional managerial structures - the bureaucracy of Brussels 1958, the authority of Robert Moses at New Yo rk 1964 - were to be supplanted by select leaders in all fields of human knowledge. Stressing that this administrative structure \"CAN SERVE AS THE BASIS OF A MOST EFFECTIVE SALES CAMPAIGN\", the Montreal architects argued that each theme component would be defined by groups of international \" scientists and specialists\", already in co ntact through their disciplines and mobilising support for the exposition in their 50 Affleck, Chevalier, et al, \"1967 Montreal World's Fair\", 3. 90 home countries.51 The scenario recalled the rise of scientific and political congresses conven ed in the atmospheres of nineteenth -century exhibitions - in 1889 there had been sixty-nine congresses; by 1900, there were 127 (the largest assembly for medicine, with over 6,000 delegates; the smallest for fencing, with only seventy-five).52 In 1962, the preferred example of such \"c ooperative international action was the I.G.Y\", the Inter national Geophysical Year, which, in 1958, created scientific exchange between East and West and saw the participation of 67 countries on various endeavours, including expeditions to Antarctica. (Originating in ideas on rocketry, the I.G.Y. was presaged by the Soviet Union's launching the Sputnik satellite on October 4, 1957, and, two months earlier, firing the world's first intercontinental ballistic missile.) The belie f in an objective, universalising worldview of science and scientists was simply to mark the discursive arc of the world's fair outside the limits of politics - hence the earliest call to abolish the national pavilion and its associated aesthetic, cultural, or political norms. Indeed, the grouping of all intellectuals, regardless of discipline, under the aegis of \"design\" granted the architect a unique degree of agency and, in turn, leadership. Collectively, the specific interests of \"scientists and speci alists\" could be made universal - communicated to a mass public in a popular event - through a point of transition provided by architecture.53 Thus the presaging of Man in the 51 Ibid., 4. 52 Richard D. Mandell, Paris 1900: The Great World's Fair (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1967), 69. 53 Michel Foucault, \"Truth and Power\", in Power/Knowledge: Selected Interviews and other Writings 1972 -1977 (New York: Pantheon Books, 1980), 126ff. Foucault describes the postwar emergence of the \"specific intellectual\" over the longstanding \"universal intellectual\" (namely, the \"great writer\"), especially given the contribu tion of specialists and professionals - doctors, lawyers, and teachers - to research and public discourse. 91 City and Man and His World in the van Ginkels' 1959 CMHC design exhibition proposal: the specific, or local, climes of Montreal and the universal, or modernising, ethos of world's fairs were conjoined in the insistence on pavilion designs functioning as civic centres (fashioned from prefabricated components). It was means to make the techno -scientific - artefacts, displays, knowledge - appreciable in the ambit of the aesthico -technical - again, the lessons of Joseph Paxton's Crystal Palace, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric le Play's Colis\u00e9e de Fer , or Contamin and Dutert's Palais des Machines , which by their very technics were systems for collecting, organising, and exhibiting peoples and things together. Here lay the desire for a new kind of managerial structure, with an almost moral authority bestowed on the world's fair as a public \"good\". The lessons of 1867, notwithstanding Saint-Simonism or Liberal ideologies, had been lifted from Giedion to inculcate 1967 with the spirit of an enlightened administration spurring a modernist imaginary. Still, as much as these expositions had been the effects of progres sive-minded elites, the van Ginkels exhibited little enthusiasm for a wholly new technocracy: theirs was a reaction to the Weberian notion of a rational bureaucracy providing the rationalisation of the modern world. Yet by virtue of a world's fair, the va n Ginkels inevitably faced an encyclopedic project: the assemblages of \"man\" - whether constituting a family or a world - were to be wholly reconsidered by the vanguardist modern architect leading the cooperative efforts of other intellectuals. The grand paradigm was, of This process, he argues, accelerates around 1960. Without mentioning architects, Foucault's schema would surely include the van Ginkels' approach t o preparing Expo 67. Apropos techno- science, Foucault identifies the atomic scientist Robert Oppenheimer \"who acted as the point of transition between the universal and specific intellectual.\" 92 course, premised on the ascendance of modernism, the final \"victor\" in Giedion's \"new tradition\". DECEMBER Still, the issue of patronage remained. No matter how evocative, the van Ginkels ' plans were inevitably bound by the limits of go vernment control and financing. This was understood from the very start - in spite of Jean Drapeau's maneuvering, the BIE bid had been domain of the Canadian government. Thus, immediately upon finishing their first memorandum on Man and H is World in late October 1962, Daniel van Ginkel and Michel Chevalier of the Montreal Citizens' Committee met the Assistant Secretary to the Cabinet at the Privy Council Office, the body advising and supporting the Canadian Prime Minister and Cabinet, gave him a copy of t heir Man and His World prospectus, pressed specifically for their \"rather special\" administrative structure , and repeatedly warned of all being lost should the fair be overtaken by bureaucrats . 54 Van Ginkel and Chevalier's attempt was to safeguard the arch itect's authority against political whim. It may have been impossible to anticipate what the Conservative government felt, with Prime Minister John Diefenbaker generally cool to the world's fair. Yet the real challenge was Drapeau, whose use of Man in th e City was aligned to his recently victorious election campaign promising a world's fair to usher Montreal's renaissance. The Mayor's agenda for slum clearance, which built on a 54 Michel Chevalier, Letter to Mr J.S. Hodgson (November 1st, 1962): n.p., 27-A21-13, Fonds van Ginkel , Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal . 93 longstanding crusade to extinguish vice, was scarcely tied some avant-garde project. His coming declaration - \"A fair is for the masses and not for the thinkers. What the masses want are monuments.\" - was, of course, hardly a paean to New Monumentality and the new forms of socialisation it presupposed. Modernity meant , modernism. van Ginkels' petitioning of government, industry, and architects , was to argue that a progressive project would only be best realised by the superior credit of the state. Not coincidently, Giedion's argument on a \"new monumentality\" had advanced precisely this nexus. I nvoking the liberal economist John Maynard Keynes, who argued for active public sector investment to stabilise output during recessions, Giedion asked, \"Why not keep the economic machinery going by creat ing civic centres?\"55 If \"hope of our period is that diverse groups are moving unconsciously in parallel directions\", then Giedion's neo -Keynesian formulation - for publicly financed urban ensembles - embodied perfectly the extension of CIAM doctrine to Ca nada, circa 1962: building architecture s for a welfare state and outside any historical crisis. Thus did the Montreal Gazette , in an editorial written right before the Canadian Parliament's Royal Assent to the Montreal exposition in December 1962, discove r \"a new urgency to many things\" with a world's fair possibly spurring massive public works previously realised only \"piecemeal\" by City Hall.56 The idea would be echoed in other 55 Giedion, \"The Need for a New Monumentality\", 566. Giedon's neo- Keynesian view likely owed to his American vantage of Depression -era works such as the Tennessee Valley Authority. 56 \"World's Fair: Chance to Plan\", The Montreal Gazette (Friday, December 14, 1962). 94 articles and editorials, some written by architect allies, championing the wo rld's fair as spurring new forms of urbanism - and hinting at creeping political opportunism.57 In December 1962, immediately after parliamentary passage of Bill C -103 establish ing the Canadian World Exhibition Corporation (CCWE) and rules on intergovernmental financing of the world's fair, the PQAA would demand that the van Ginkels' intertwined visions on a plan and an administration be made official policy: \"only an architect, taking part in all discussions of the afore mentioned Board of Directors, can convince the members of the esthetical importance of the Fair; indeed, the artistic and functional value of the master plan, as well as the co -ordination of the architectural aspect of the buildings designed by hundreds of architects of various countries must be subordinate to a master idea.\" 58 \"Political men\" were to be thanked for having obtained the fair; but only those possessed by the greater consciousness of aesthetics could \"prevent its sinking into mediocrity\". Without a master plan, the fear was of losing artistic control. As 1962 drew to a close, the Montreal world's fair remained in the outlines of modernist polemic. The van Ginkels' plans followed perfectly Giedi on's evocation of New Monumentality : Not haphazard world's fairs, which in their present form have lost their old significance, but newly created civic centers should be the site for collective emotional events, where people play as important a role as the spectacle itself, and where a unity of the architectural background, the people and the symbols conveyed 57 Campbell Merret, \"Four Locations Instead\" , The Montreal Star (December 5, 1962). 58 Paul O.

Tr\u00e9panier wrote in his capacity as President of the PQAA. 95 by the spectacles will arise. \"59 To see public gathering space as a designed cultural realm was to believ e that a synthesis of the arts could transform the city. Man in the City had provided an approach to reshape Montreal; now Man and His World, though still without accompanying architectural rendering, offered a way to reimagine humanity. It was in this gap between polemic and design that the uses of Giedion - history committed to a contemporary cause - mattered. The declarativ e tone of the van Ginkels' reports meant to collapse space and time between 1962 and 1967. Rhetorically, it was to dispel any doubt on the feasibility of creating a world city ex nihilo within four years. Politically, it was to safeguard the intellectual origins of the plan. Newspaper and PQAA editorials could only end 1962 by obliquely warning of a withering of the plan by political expediency and ambition. Drapeau had already begun to distance himself from Man in the City. Soon, it would be the turn of other governments. The onus remained on the architects. To preserve their vision, a design was required. JANUARY From July to December, the van Ginkels had gone from informally discussing a hypothetical world's fair to finding their polemic possibly the official line on Expo 67. The creation of the Canadian Corporation for the World Exhibition ( CCWE) by Parliament, along with the earmarking of federal funds , made the BIE decision a reality. To the public - as well as 59 Giedion, \"The Need for a New Monumentality\", 568. 96 many politicians - this may have seemed an insurmountable task. To the van Ginkels, it was only a matter of making Man and His World as architecture. It simply required intellectual consensus. In early January 1963, the PQAA announced that its upcoming annual convention would be devoted solely to the Montreal world's fair. The programme grew from closed - door meetings instigated by the van Ginkels throughout December. A key gathering found Claude Robillard, director of the City Planning Department and ardent supporter of the van Ginkels' ideas on placing the fair in the city, vigorously defending their concepts in Drapeau's presence. 60 \"Man and His World\" was made the official line of the province's architects . At stake was not only defining a design but protecting the authority of th e existing theme. In a study prepared under the auspices of the PQAA shortly before its retreat, the Montreal architect Ray Affleck, who had worked alongside the van Ginkels on proposing Man and His World, insisted, \"The protection of the concept is crucial because it is, in our view, essential that the Corporation engage with enthusiasm to defend the concept, which will be under constant assault for many reasons over the course of the next four years.\" 61 To defend the concept was also to secure its aesthe tic aims. In this, the theme underwent a kind 60 Yves Jasmin , La Petite Histoire d 'Expo 67 : des de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec, Janvier 1963, Exposition Universelle et Internationale de 1967, 'M\u00e9thodes pour assurer une Exposition de grande qualit\u00e9 Gagnon, C anadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal ; translation by author. 97 of transmutation: Man and His World had, in the interregnum between the BIE decision and announcement of the PQAA congress, become Terre des Hommes . The transliteration, coincidently appeasing a French -speaki ng host city and political class, was duly given an intellectual origin. Both architects and world peoples, Affleck argued, believe a manifestation of great style can result from an awareness of the \"TERRE DES HOMMES\" and can be an important marker in th e history of the world if it is the result of a concerted effort by all men on Earth . \"Un spectacle n'a point de sens sinon \u00e0 travers une culture, une civilisation, un m\u00e9tier\". (St-Exup\u00e9ry, Terre des Hommes.) A fair of national pavilions will have no place in 1967; but an exposition ordered and programmed by the components of \"TERRE DES HOMMES\", and to which all people contribute through their own activity rather than under the banner of their nation, will be a true image of our time .62 The repeated trop e of a supra -national, extra -statist spectacle now found additional grounding in the late French pioneering aviator and writer Antoine de Saint -Exup\u00e9ry's book Terre des Hommes of 1939. Recounting long-distance and often dangerous flying expeditions in Sou th America and to French colonies in North Africa, Saint -Exup\u00e9ry, writing with the extraordinary power of aerial perspective, offered ruminations on the human condition, especially of a fraternal order arising in experiences of facing the obstacles and dan gers of natural phenomena. 63 The renamed world's fair theme owed to Robillard, an admirer of Saint -Exup\u00e9ry's writings, who had noted the coincident titles when previously discussing the exhibition aims with the van Ginkels and others. (The book's English title, Wind, Sand and 62 Le Comit\u00e9 du Congr \u00e8s de l'Association des \"Exposition Universelle 1967, 'Terres Des Hommes'\", press release 2 -3, Box 39 -1990-002-35, Fonds Gilles Gagnon, Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal ; translation by author. 63 S. Benyon John, Saint -Exup\u00e9 ry: Vol de Nuit and Terre des Hommes (London: Grant & Cutler Ltd, 1 990), 38ff. 98 Stars, could hardly have illustrated their ambitions.) In willfully transposing Man and His World to Terre des Hommes the PQAA architects directly took a contextualising phrase from Saint -Exup\u00e9ry's opening chapter: \"a spectacle has n o meaning except it be seen through the glass of a culture, a civilization, a craft.\"64 The manifold aspects of \"man\" - already identified as problems , aspirations , needs , environment , spirit , and family - still awaited registration through an architectura l prism. In announcing its upcoming retreat, the PQAA stated that its world's fair studies would be largely \"theoretical\" and not \"immediately practical\".65 The caveat was to allow deferring decisions on specific kinds of architectural form. Gathering in the small parish town of Lac Beauport outside Quebec City on the last weekend of January, groups of PQAA delegates, from both established and emerging practices, delivered a series of position papers on Terre des Hommes . One overarching philosophical demand, already publicised in the newspapers, guided the proceedings: to design a universal exhibition, not an international one. 66 Four committees presented ideas on parcelling the exhibition by \"Concept\" (to establish \"the real 'raison d'\u00eatre' for a World's Fair at this time and in this place\"), \"The Theme\" (to outline \"exhibition subjects which concern many nations\"), \"Mise -en-Sc\u00e8ne\" (to define \"a great and thrilling spectacle rather than an 64 Antoine de Saint -Exup\u00e9ry , Wind, Sand and Stars , trans.

Ideologically, this was, as would be repeatedly suggested, a fetish for organisations like the United Nations, UNESCO, and the World Health Organisation - not as institutions but in their representations of multiple kinds of cultural forces and pacific realignments of peoples. Architecturally, the challenge lay in approximating these \"human relationships\" as meaningful \"visual relationships\" (a key 10 trope), which Lemco van Ginkel, chairing the \"Concept\" group (comprising her husband and the architects responsible for advancing \"Man and His World\" a few months earlier ), presented as a large -scale building system: Each of the components of the theme could be housed in a distinct section of the exhibition grounds - a single structure, a group of buildings, or a compound - as seems most suitable. Each nation could buy space or erect a structure within one or more of these functional subsections. The functional division of theme is proposed in another paper, but as an example of the concept, one might imagine that there be a compound devoted to the environment of man, his aspiration, his achievements in the north, in which Canada, Russia, the U.S.A., Sweden, Finland, and Denmark might participate.... A nation could erect its own pavilion within the functional ensemble or exhibit within the key pavilion of the group. The approach would give equal opportunity to the big nations and small - to the long established and to the formative. 68 Mindful of decolonisation, the proposal recalibrated power relations between nations by suggesting, however obliquely, contemporaneous trends in \"plug in\" arc hitectures that 67 \"The 1967 International Exhibition at Montreal: PQAA Discusses Concept, Th eme ' Mise en Scene' and Methods to Produce a Fair of Top Quality\", Journal of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada (April 1963): 70-71. 68 Blanche Lemco van Ginkel et al., \"A Concept\" (Province of Quebec Association of Architects Convention, January 17, Box 39-1990- 002-35, Fonds Gilles Gagnon, C anadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal . 100 presumed to release buildings from traditional fixity by making possible structures in which all components could be flexible and mobile. Accordingly, countries were simply to link to a greater \"functional ensemble\", thus losing political status but acquiring cultural standing with displays on shared scientific endeavour. Against atomisation by national pavilions, the notion of some determining superstructure - as architecture - was to resist reducing things to individual, triumphal concer ns. Works of art or science were no longer to be seen simply as objects but as common though necessarily changing human practices. The other PQAA study groups followed Lemco van Ginkel's reasoning. Those exploring \"The Theme\" now extend ed her team's ideas to architecture. Reiterating both the subthemes of \"man\" and the earliest ambitions for a permanent project of urban renewal, the committee asked, \"Can these examples be translated in concrete, visual, and three- dimensional terms?\" 69 Aesthetics or for ms were not yet privileged; instead, the design was to proceed by granting \"the spectator the privilege of choice\".70 This was fundamentally a problem of circulation : In treating the subject of Terre des Hommes , the exhibition architect and organiser must recognise and respect the nature of \"man the visitor\". This unique agent of the fair, multiplied across cities and nations, offered any number of ways of seeing things and occupying space: 69 H. Mayerovitch et al., \"Le Th\u00e8me\" (Congr\u00e8s non, C anadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal ; translation by author. 70 Ibid., 9, translation by author. 101 Thus, a visitor should be able to change his subject of attractio n or stimulation of his various sense , visual, aural, tactile, artistic, etc. As such, The spectator must play a subjective role as creator in the process of linking together the exhibits\".71 The gesture of consistently reorganising - that is, re -perceiv ing - an infinite array of objects by travelling on changing pathways was to criticise museumification, thus world's fairs as ossified institutions for presenting the world. If the agency granted to the visitor had architectural corollary, then it lay in ideas on creating forms that could change over time but retain coherence and meaning - hallmark of \"Structuralism\", a tendency emerging in Dutch architecture circles that Daniel van Ginkel, part of the Theme study group, knew intimately, not least by his f riend Aldo van Eyck bringing it to Team 10 discourse. Yet the formal - spatial suggestion also likely owed to another committee member: Alfred Neumann, an Israeli \u00e9migr\u00e9 teaching at Laval University in Quebec City, who had, in the 1950s, realised a series o f remarkable projects marked by non-orthogonal cluster geometries (notably Bat Yam City Hall of 1963). Neumann, a Czech who had studied under Peter Behrens and worked for Auguste Perret, immigrated to Israel in 1949 and attended CIAM congresses in 1947 (where Lemco van Ginkel participated with van Eyck and Giedion), 1951, and 1953 (which saw the rise of Team 10). 72 Neumann's inventive work, which he called \"Morphologic 71 Ibid., 10, 11, translation by author. 72 Mumford, The CIAM Discourse on Urbanism, 1928 -1960, 204, 245, 337; Rafi Segal, Unit, Pattern, Site: Th e Space Packed Architecture of Alfred Neumann, 1949 -1968, PhD Dissertation, Princeton University (Ann Arbor: ProQuest/UMI Dissertations Publishing , 2011), 123-125. At the 1947 CIAM meeting, Neumann presented regional planning schemes for Czechoslovakia. He also attended a CIAM planning meeting in La Sarraz in 102 Architecture\", bore conceptual overtones of Structuralism, largely in adopting bio - mecha nical models of cellular growth as paradigms for design and society, with a typically related interest in the prefabrication of recognisable building units capable of myriad combinations.73 The conscious projection of an informal organisation was, at its most anarchistic, to imply a purposeful breakdown of architectural order into forms that were to be more culturally accessible.74 There was, here, the suggestion of a self -regulating element in the ways a large building - pavilion -cum -exposition -cum -city - was conceptualised: instead of following predetermined configurations, users were, in theory, given means to alter their own environment and to choose their own patterns of behaviour. For now, the spirit of self -organising structures - architectural as well as social - reflected a political sentiment. The Theme group based its recommendations on condemning \"chauvinistic nationalism\" that only arrested human and scientific development, a condition writ large in competing national pavilions incapable of symb olising any kind of \"mutual cooperation\". Yet an altogether different nationalism lay in \"a political form taken by man as emancipation toward liberty or equality\"; here, again, the rise of new nations was to temper the hegemony of \"super -pavilions erecte d, for example, by the United States and the USSR with the sole aim of accentuating their antagonism and 1955. He was joined at Laval University by Zvi Hecker, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 from the Technion (where Neumann taught in the 1950s) who had also collaborated on key projects in Israel. Neumann would die in 1968. 73 Alfred Neumann, \"Morphologic Architecture\", Journal of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada (May 1963): 40- 47. 74 Colquhoun, Modern Architecture , 222. 103 reducing other national exhibits to the state of pygmies.\"75 (It was a prescient sense of the American and Soviet pavilions facing one another at Expo 67, and recalled Albert Speer's classicising vision of the Third Reich confronting Boris Iofan's social realist monument to the USSR at the 1937 Paris Exposition Universelle.) The exhaustion of nationalism was, in the immediate postwar decades, a topic of popular concern - as Reinhold Niebuhr, then called \"greatest living political philosopher of America\", put it, \"Our problem is that technics have established a rudimentary world community but have not integrated it organically, morally, or politically.\" 76 Here, in the most perverse sense, \"mutually assured destruction\" by nuclear weapons - the most modern of technics - was a means of assuring peace by stalemate. Indeed, while never mentioning it, the van Ginkels and the PQAA architects were surely attuned to fundamentally opposing visions of the very themes they wished to champion - sentiments captured by Franz Fanon's in his recently published book Les Damn\u00e9s de la Terre of 1961, which explained the dehumanising effects of colonialism and justified viole nce against colonialist regimes. Europeans \"never stop talking of Man\", he wrote; \"today we know what sufferings humanity has suffered for every one of their triumphs of the mind\". 77 It was hardly the thematic of the world's fair plans. Yet Fanon's call to action was answered differently elsewhere, notably Martin Luther King Jr.'s borrowing of Gandhian non-violence to mobilise a mass movement for civil rights. The indictment of 75 Mayerovitch et al., \"Le Th \u00e8me\", 5-6, translation by author . 76 Reinhold Niebuhr quoted i n Stimson, The Pivot of the World: Photography and Its Nation , 13. 77 Franz Fanon quoted in Stimson, The Pivot of the World: Photography and Its Nation , 14. 104 Enlightenment rationality - of \"man\" - was inevitably Janus -faced: on the one hand, to be the \"wretched of the earth\"; on the other hand, to discover the terre des hommes anew. Confronted by events - the Cuban Missile Crisis unfolded at the very moment the van Ginkels turned to \"Man and His World\" in late October 1962 - many comme ntators and intellectuals in the non -communist world could only approach the question of political identity by appealing to some supranational basis of expression .78 A committee of intellectuals officially charged to define Terre des Hommes in May 1963, wo uld insist that every aspect of the world exhibition - from design to theme, from objects to nations - serve \"the need for transhumanism\".79 To the architects considering the world's fair, only the city provided an ideal medium for this synthesis. The role given to the visitor as \"creator\" - surveying, thus making public, artefacts and ideas comprising the many themes - implicitly drew on notions of a liberated political subject. As programme, the endless construction of new experiences of space - \"a method of approach 'by function'\", the Theme committee insisted - would , the architects believed, become \"prototypical\" for future fairs.80 The gesture of non -hierarchical spaces extended the political equilibrium to be set by the world's fair, a n ambition surely resonant to van Ginkel and Neumann, who had both spent the war under German occupation, the former in the 78 Stimson, The Pivot of the World: Photography and Its Nation , 13ff. Stimson outlines the nexus o f popular philosophy and the arts in establishing frameworks, such as the famous Family of Man exhibition, for supranational expressions on artistic and political fraternity. 79 \"The Theme 'Terre des Hommes' and its Development at the Canadian World Exhibi tion in Montreal, 1967\", Report of the Montebello 7, Box 39- 1990- 07-001, Fonds Gilles Gagnon, Canadian Centre Mayerovitch et al., \"Le Th \u00e8me\" , 13, translation by author . 105 Netherlands where he was active in the Dutch Resistance, the latter in the Theresienstadt ghetto in Czechoslovakia .81 Indeed, explaining his theory on \"morphologic architecture\" in an article published in the Journal of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada soon after the PQAA deliberations, Neumann would attempt \"a mixture of biology and esthetics\" by noting important lessons in \"space packing\" (of Platonic and Archimedean solids) gleaned from crystallography, which gave insight on reimaging modern building types - specifically attributes of rectilinearity - and, therefore, inherited social structures (and the classical rationalism guiding them) .82 The argument paralleled trends in divining in biological models a notion on form and structure as a totality, while seeing constituent parts as forever changing and adapting. While exhibiting less of the technological determinism accompanying such dis courses (espoused by Buckminster Fuller, among others), and despite openly setting his argument at a remove from modernist teleology that traced conceptual origins to the Baroque (with veiled reference to Giedion's Space, Time and Architecture ), Neumann ne vertheless proposed a new historical plateau: 81 For an overview of Neumann's work and life, see: Noam Dvir, \"A look into the life of one of Israel 's most important, yet forgotten architects\", Haaretz (Tel Aviv, January 19, 2012), http://www.haaretz.com, accessed July 8, 2013. With interests in morphology and prefabrication, Neuma nn advanced a unique modular system, M\u00f8, which originated in a theory of proportion. Walter Gropius, who remained concerned by prefabrication, would note: \"The EM- PHI System (Humanization of Space) by Alfred Newman represents, in my opinion, an important contribution to the whole field of design, planning, architecture, and industrial design. It is the first attempt I know to create a modular system which comprehends the whole range of po ssibilities of proportion.... The only system akin to the new investi gations of Alfred Neumann is Le Corbusier's Modulor, which has been conceived intuitively. Mr. Neumann goes beyond this syste m and gives it an all- embracing mechanical background.\" See: Letter from Walter Gropius (January 7, 1953), quoted Rafi Segal, Uni t, Pattern, Site: The Space Packed Architecture of Alfred Neumann, 1949 -1968, 1. 82 Alfred Neumann, \"Morphologic Architecture\", Journal of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada (May 1963): 40- 47. 106 Different stages of civilization have different optimal population densities and use corresponding space packing. Hunting and fishing communities lived in loosely packed round houses, of the topological kind, in accordance with low population density. Agricultural civilizations created the rectangular euclidean [ sic] pattern. Industrial civilization with its high population density is still packed into an outlined agricultural frame work and has yet to create its own pattern. The rotational symmetries of the new patterns which were meaningless before the space age now become the exact bearers of widely understood contemporary symbolism. 83 While \"new patterns\" of \"contemporary symbolism\" awaited elaboration, t he discovery of such forms - or at least their sources in bio -mechanical phenomena (\"What is important is thinking in analogies\", Neumann insisted) - also revealed an insidious aspect of \"contemporary symbolism\": Stone minarets still tower above the cupola s of the mosques. Not far from them on some missile launching site rise identical shapes, the rockets no more built of stone. These containers built of modern synthetic materials fly into outer space to destroy themselves and perhaps to spread destruction. Two identical shapes but what a difference in function. The cupola of today might be one of the inflatable structures which blow here today and there tomorrow.... The nostalgic longing for the stable, symbolic architecture of yesterday, and maybe of to morrow, remains stronger than ever, the eternal polarity of all human endeavour. 84 The minaret and rocket - culture and science, tradition and innovation - embodied precisely those archetypes imagined harmoniously aligned in the trans -historical project of a world's fair. The nostalgic levelling of past and future could, Neumann suggested, only but carry hidden ironies: the cupola transformed into some lightweight, floating structure was simply Buckminster Fuller's geodesic dome transported by United States Marine Corps helicopters as mobile shelters and elsewhere deployed as radar installations for the Distant Early 83 Ibid., 46. 84 Ibid. 107 Warning (DEW) Line built across the Canadian North as a frontline system guarding against Soviet bomber attack (fig. 2.6).85 Completed in Octo ber 1962, the very moment of the first rumblings of Man and His World, the DEW Line, an uninterrupted 6000 -mile surveillance chain from the Aleutian Islands to Iceland , hardly epitomise d, despite its engineering triumph, what Lemco van Ginkel's Concept group sought in a \"compound\" - a pavilion - devoted to a greater \"environment of man\" (which they offered in the Arctic). The rocket and minaret were to overcome the menace of Cold War hostility and Third World poverty; they were also symbols of the ways in which the Montreal exhibition - as world map - waited to be divided. One critical concept of space remained undivided - the city as site. Throughout their weekend deliberations, the PQAA study groups stayed committed to the van Ginkels' Man in the City - not necessarily in terms of its particular sites but as a counterpoint to the existing environment. While the van Ginkels had outlined a project of urban renewal - a mix of Team 10 counterform strategies and North American slum clearance schemes - the shift to Terre des Hommes gave broader scope by displacing concerns from the needs of city to the values of theme . The PQAA study group on \"Mise en Sc\u00e8ne\" , concerned by \"the problems of and possibilities of presenting an international exhibition of this nature as a great and thrilling spectacle rather than as an illustrated lecture or a museum experience\", insisted: \"The spectacle thus depends (for better or for worse), for its character and the 85 Fuller's geodesics were fami liar to Montreal architects. A Canadian branch of the Fuller Research Institute opened in 1950, with the first aluminium geodesic dome built in the Montreal suburbs and published in Canadian architecture journals. Fuller also had led a well -publicised geodesics workshop at McGill in 1956, published in The Canadian Architect (March 1957). 108 quality of its inspiration, on the city that houses it.\"86 The city was \"to house\" the fair; reciprocally, the fair would \"make the city visible\", remain \"centred between the two poles of the city, its genius loci : the Mountain and the River\", and appear \"grafted to the urban tissue as much as possible\".87 On the one hand, the exhibition would return Montreal to its origins between the St Lawrence River and Mont Royal, the hill immediately west of downtown that gave the city its name. (The van Ginkels had, in fact, earlier worked to prevent encroachment on the mountai nside park.) On the other hand, any siting was to respect the Theme committee's edict on Terre des Hommes : \"For us it implies man's possession of the world or active manipulation by man of natural forces and social structures.\" 88 The idea was endorsed by a powerful voice: Louis Kahn, who arrived in Lac Beauport as the PQAA's keynote speaker. In an excursus otherwise coloured by characteristic mythico -poetic overstatement, Kahn first praised the PQAA committees and made suggestions on the world's fair by describing its public function: Therefore, in thinking just briefly, as I said to day [ sic] and only yesterday, one of the things I realize is that probably it is not an institution. An exhibition - a world exhibition - is not an institution but is a kind of inspiration.... And then you begin to say, \"Is it architecture as we know it?\" I would say, No, because it is not an institution. Because every building that a man makes is answerable to an institution, either it be the institution of learning or the institution, I'll say, of home or the 86 \"The 1967 International Exhibition at Montreal: PQAA Discusses Concept, Theme ' Mise en Scene' and Methods to Produce a Fair of Top Quality\", Journal of the Royal Arc hitectural Institute of Canada (April 1963): 70-71; V.

It isn't a question of fantasy, it's a question of starting from a beginning which has no precedence whatsoever.... 89 To be uncoupled from institutional precedent - from architectural type - meant to be free of history and precedent . No longer seen as \"buildings\", the world's fair \"will merely be, you might say, spaces, a realm of spaces\"; \"therefore to get around the buildings should be your main concern, architecturally. And t he residual spaces which come from your system of movement throughout the entire exhibition should be the architecture of the exhibit.\" 90 The solution lay in \"viaduct architecture\", a recent manifestation of Kahn's ongoing Philadelphia Centre City studies that had previously so influenced the van Ginkels and Team 10. In 1961, a grant from the Graham Foundation enabled Kahn to develop his ideas in a new project gathering public administration, commercial buildings, transport systems, and sports facilities within a civic complex connected by a system of elevated multilevel \"viaducts\" for the circulation of people, traffic, and infrastructure (specifically water). 91 Kahn had spoken publicly about \"architecture of movement\" at the Team 10 meeting in Otterlo in 1959, where the van Ginkels were present.92 By the time he addressed the PQAA, he had rendered 89 Louis Kahn, \"Address Delivered by Louis I.

A powerful argument for concentrated urban life - thus opposing decentralisation - the idea was likely familiar to the PQAA delegates, not least given an interview of Kahn by the van Ginkels published a year earlier in the journal Canadian Art, with van Ginkel comparing Kahn's theory to Le Corbusier's viaduc autostrade plans circa 1930 and Kenzo Tange's very recent Tokyo Bay proposal with its massive floating spine of civic institutions and ancillary axes of housing. Notwithstanding his interest in \"institutions\", Kahn's insistence on only \"viaducts\" reflected a consensus emerging at the PQAA congress for some kind of large -scale architecture animated by the movement of peoples and things and not dictated by the concerns of cultural representation. *** The PQAA conference concluded with a resounding endorsement of theme , concept , and mise-en-sc\u00e8ne. Terre des Hommes , or Man and His World (the perfect bilingual rejoinder necessary to Canadian identity politics), became the official statement on the world exhibition by the province's architects. This massive elaboration on the world came with a price - $40 million dollars, established by an agreement between the federal, provincial, and city governments signed ahead of the PQAA retreat. 93 The magazine Canadian Architect, 93 \"Agreement between the Government of Canada, the Government of the Province of Quebec, and the City of Montreal\" (18 January 1963), n.p., Series VM3 -S0-D3, Fonds du Secr\u00e9t\u00e9ri at G\u00e9n\u00e9ral, City of Montreal Archives. The funding was divided between the federal (50%), provincial (37.5%) and city (12.5%) governments. 111 while reporting on the PQAA deliberations, thought the figure \"impossibly low\".94 The tripartite accord also gave a place - specifically on the island of Montreal, at least 500 acres in area, as free as possible of existing buildings, and near highways and infrastructure.95 There was, finally, a deadline - land acquisition and expropriation was to be completed within six months and the site cleared exac tly one year later, in June 1964.96 In this, the van Ginkels' ideas largely remained intact. As Montreal newspapers would report in early February, a waterfront site - among the areas first pinpointed in Man in the City - slated to receive federal assista nce for slum clearance efforts was now \"known to be under consideration as a site for the 1967 World's Fair\". 97 At the very same moment, Claude Robillard, Montreal's planning director and the van Ginkels' ally who had advanced Terre des Hommes as theme, wa s made director general of planning of what was now officially called the Canadian World Exhibition. In six short months, the Montreal world's fair had seemingly crystallised a series of claims on the future of modern architecture as the basis of a federa lly funded and internationally symbolic urban experiment. Following the PQAA congress, Man in the City and Man and His World appeared reconciled. In a sense, this only required the former, as 94 \"Heigh Ho Come to the Fair/Exhibition\", 104. 95 \"Agreement between the Government of Canada, the Government of the Province of Quebec, and the City of Montreal\", n.p. 96 Ibid. 97 \"Waterfront Area to Be Renovated\", The Montreal Star (February 14, 1963); Bill Bantey, \"Fair Choice Down to Four Sites\", The Gazette (Montreal, February 11, 1963). 112 site, making public the latter, as concept . Yet as Lemco van Ginkel knew, there was a tension between the two. Two weeks before the PQAA meeting, she wrote to Lewis Mumford, the American historian and architecture critic who had long countered CIAM functionalism by insisting on decentralised regional planning (whil e also decrying humankind's alienation from metabolic life by its use of instrumental technology). Enclosing memoranda on Man in the City and Man and His World, Lemco van Ginkel alerted Mumford to efforts behind defining the world's fair. Mumford had in fact worked on the film The City , which, shown at the 1939 New York World's Fair, took as its theme the contrast between existing industrialised cities and planned \"green towns\". He saw world's fairs as fundamentally utopian sites, arguing in 1937: The ke y to the Fair is the plan. In essence, a World's Fair is a miniature city, a very special kind of city, but still a city. If one is going to portray the possibilities of communal life in the remaining decades of the twentieth century - and that seems to be the general idea - it is with the primary visualization of the modern city, any modern city that the designers might have begun. 98 Unfortunately, \"From this standpoint, the skeleton plan is incredibly old -fashioned.\" Now facing Robert Moses again at th e helm of another New York world's fair, Mumford quickly replied to Lemco van Ginkel and encouraged her on \"buil ding a portion of the new city\" and 98 Lewis Mumford, \"The World's Fair\", The New Yorker (May 8, 1937) in Robert Wojtowicz, ed., Sidewalk Critic: Lewis Mumford's Writings on New York (New York: Princeton Architectural Press, 1998), 181. For Mumford, the ideal scenario was for the New York Architectural League, which was then exhibiting the upcoming 1939 world's fairs plans, to have \"become an American version of the Deutscher Werkbund\" - in other words, an institution committed to full -scale exhibitions of social housing. 113 eliminating any need for \"national buildings\".99 Lemco van Ginkel had, when writing to Mumford, actually con ceded that even as \"the mayor announced 'Terre des Hommes' as theme\" it \"was evident, however, that everyone still was thinking in terms of a conventional chauvinist free -for-all, complemented by the sales pitches of major industries - paying lip service t o a theme.\"100 Thus, Our two points can be separated - site and concept - although both result from the same philosophy. Being concerned with the future of Montreal, perhaps site is most important to us. All other proposals involve ancillary public works which would damage the future growth of the city.101 Prey to political manipulation, the Canadian World Exhibition could preserve its ethos - \"we think of IGY and the Aswan Dam, and the international success of the 'Family of Man' exhibition\" - by revivify ing the city. To Lemco van Ginkel, o nly this could resist the drive toward short -lived spectacle. The van Ginkels' earliest hopes were remarkable statements on culture and design advanced ahead of a turbulent decade. Their insistence on a radical proje ct was, however, to force a crisis within postwar modernism: the progressive thematisation of an ephemeral event like a world's fair could only but be coopted by the inherently conservative basis of the nation state. It remained whether some sufficiently visionary statement - recalled in nineteenth -century exhibitions, drawn from suggestions on \"open\" structures , evoked in 99 Lewis Mumford, Letter to Blanche Lemco van Ginkel (18 January 1963): 1 -2, Series 27 -A21-02, Fonds van Ginkel, Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal; van , Architecture of Instruction and Delight: A Socio -historical Analysis of World Exhibitions as -1851-1 970), 465-466. 100 Blanche Letter Mumford 11, 1963): 1, Series 27 -A21-02, Fonds van Ginkel, Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal. 101 Ibid. 114 \"viaduct architecture\" - could achieve the utopian demands of the past six months. 1963 waited. So did a master plan and its architec ture. 115 Chapter 3: Plan The truth is that my ethmoid sinuses broke down on the eve of Fair Day, and this meant I had to visit the Fair carrying a box of Kleenex concealed in a copy of the Herald Tribune. When you can't breathe through your nose, Tomorrow seems strangely like the day before yesterday. E.B. White, \"The World of Tomorrow\" (May 1939) The demand was, finally, to organis e the \"world\" si ngularly through architecture. To achieve it, Daniel van Ginkel was made chief planner of Expo 67 in January 1963. By December, he was gone . Public confusion on his being fired or resigning would only obscure the fact that the master plan was never to become \"Man in the City\". Finally built on a pair of artificial islands in the middle of the St Lawrence River, and p rey to political expediency, Expo 67 would be splintered into national, cultural, and corporate pavilions, each competing by its pro gressive or kitsch architecture, sometimes both. Despite van Ginkel's appointment, little would evolve as imagined. Soon af ter the approval of the world exhibition by the Bureau International des Expositions , Montreal mayor Jean Drapeau began signalling a retreat from Man in the City , finally insisting on a site outside the downtown core. Notwithstanding real concerns on sequ estration and compensation accompanying urban renewal , Drapeau's vision for Montreal lay in wilily negotiating a cityscape, defined along linguistic lines , by forms of architectural patronage, with new cultural and corporate complexes built to satisfy shifting political alliances .1 In this terrain, the world's fair was simply to be kept at bay - it could never enter the everyday 1 Drapeau had started his political career as an ardent Quebec nationalist, believing that French Canadians had a special mission to fulfill on the North American continent. By the 1960s, his view would be tempered by political expediency - a soft nationalism, perhaps, and one designed carefully to manipulate relations with the federal government. 116 politics of the city. The final islands site, actually adjacent to but forever divorced from the van Ginkels' original urban pla n, was to be a spectacle of \"monuments\" for the \"masses\" as the mayor had already deemed. The provisional relation to the city centre served strictly to lend prestige to perceptions of wholesale urban change. Still, a visionary project remained. The insistence on a site (in the city), a theme (of the facets of man), and an administration (by architects) gave contour to a massive complex that awaited architectural elaboration. Ahead of Drapeau's machinations, van Ginkel's authority over the Expo 67 master plan allowed vestiges of Man in the City to crystallise in remarkable architectural studies that, in their very technics and grounded in au courant concepts on city design, attempted to organise - and to make public - all forms of global cultural product ion. A belief remained in finding architectures capable of ordering a mass public outside the typical atomisation of world's fairs into competing pavilions. Indeed, by leaving behind man in the city, Expo 67 would gain an unexpected authority - a space, outside marketplace demands, for an honest test of theory. THEME , REDUX The PQAA had, during its retreat in late January 1963, advanced Terre des Hommes as both an intellectual and architectural preoccupation. Along with committees exploring concept , theme , and mise -en-sc\u00e8ne, a group led by Raymond Affleck (the important Montreal architect who had assisted the van Ginkels o n defining \"Man and His World\") addressed methods on \"defending\" the social and spatial values of the exhibition, which \"will constantly be 117 threatened during the next four years\".2 It was perhaps already the anticipation of Drapeau's manoeuvrings and the realisation of a tepid commitment by a federal government holding the purse strings. At stake was always preserving the theme agains t its cooption by private interest. Just as the van Ginkels had earlier argued for some kind of enlightened administration (attuned to the aesthetic and cultural project of setting the exhibition in the city), Affleck and his colleagues suggested two comm issions - \"without executive powers but impossible to ignore\" - comprising experts from various fields working to define the theme along with \"cr\u00e9ateurs - techniciens\" developing the actual design.3 Entering into joint venture, the van Ginkels and Affleck's office Arcop continued to recommend a similar division of labour : sketched as a flow chart were, on the one hand, the architect, engineer, and planner working on the \"Preliminary Site\"; on the other hand was a \"Brains Trust\" tasked with \"Development of Concept and Theme\" (fig. 3.1). Both groups, while exchanging ideas but remaining within their disciplinary silos, were to produce the \"Finalization of Theme & its Concretization as a Preliminary Plan\". From this, a series of \"theme groups\", led by architec ts, would transform Terre des Hommes into discourses on built form. The deadline for ideas was September. The links between design and society were, so far, c onceived in the privileged view and aestheti c sensibility of the architect. This was, in fact, precisely what made the Montreal 2 R. Affleck et al., \"M\u00e9thodes pour assurer une Exposition de grande qualit\u00e9 visuelle\" (Province of Quebec Association of Architects Convention, January 1963): 2, Box 39 -1990 -002-35, Fonds Gilles Gagnon, Canadian . 3 Ibid., 3ff., translation by author; \"PQAA Discusses Concept, Theme ' Mise en Scene ' and Methods to Produce a Fair of Top Quality\", Journal of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada (April 1963): 71. 118 exhibition so unique: its origins lay in the realm of \"creative -technicians\" and not by virtue of a vested technocratic class , no matter how progressive. The worldview was not only to define a scope for architecture as an equally didactic ( a pavilion) and ameliorative ( an urban plan) force - thereby ensuring a societal embrace of modernism - but to insist that any conceptualisation, periodisation, and selection would be done outside the norms of political sentiment and control. Hence the \"Brains Trust\": architects were , in defining the exhibition architecture, to be aided by intellectuals and specialists - imagined responsible for things like The Family of Man or the International Geophysical Year - tasked with compiling th e artefacts and ideas totaling the sub -themes of Terre des Hommes . This search for a new globalism was to replace but remain as inspiring as the old nationalisms. The Family of Man , which had so influenced the van Ginkels', exemplified this quest for a new political subjectivity in the aftermath of world war. On the one hand, the impetus was to declare modern man to be obsolete; on the other hand, the emergent late modernism was still based on a residual and fully modernist - deeply nineteenth -century - formal principle of a system or plan for modern life. Sigfried Giedion's teleology - the great exhibitions as organisational forms for contemporary subjectivity - made the latter utterly clear to the architects. These very same kinds of systems of ratio nalisation had also produced horrors - Giedion's excursus in Mechanization Takes Command on nineteenth -century Cincinnati slaughterhouses was a less than veiled reading of the Nazi concentration camps. Nevertheless the \"function\" of art - including archit ecture and, presumably, world's fairs - was, as Laszlo Moholy -Nagy, whose \"new vision\" had shaped Giedion's approach to history, 119 put it in a 1943 lecture on \"The Contribution of the Arts to Social Reconstruction\" to be \"a seismograph of the relationships of the individual to the world, intuitive re -creation of the balance the emotional, intellectual and social existences of the individual.\"4 Moholy -Nagy's argument, advanced in the same year as Giedion's \"New Monumentality\", concluded on noting the Federal Art Project, a Depression -era Works Progress Administration undertaking that had only finished in 1943: \"It represented a gigantic educational work, not in the sense that it 'brought art to the people' or created art for the people, but that it tried to anchor it in, with, among, and of the people.\" 5 There was, of course, an appeal to the state as provider of such social reconstruction - a sentiment echoed in New Monumentality and, of course, the van Ginkels' plans. There was equally a rhetorical construc tion, marking the 1940s and 1950s, of a supranational ambition that was self -consciously public in orientation and broadly noble, eager, and magnanimous in spirit. 6 By the end of the 1950s, the liberal idea of a global political identity may well have become fraught - somewhere, a Non -Aligned Movement further bifurcating Cold War lines; elsewhere, \"Coca -Colonialism\" carrying the cultural imperialism of American industry. Indeed, efforts to shape Canadian identity often responded to the looming spectre of l'americanisme , its popular culture to be resisted in the creation of homegrown institutions for the arts and communications, its military -industrial 4 Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, \"The Contribution of the Arts to Social Reconstruction\" (1943), in Richard Kostelanetz, ed., Moholy -Nagy: An Anthology (New York: Da Capo Press, 1970), 21; Blake Stimson, The Pivot of the World: Photography and Its Nation (Cambridge MA: The MIT Press, 2006) , 16. 5 Moholy- Nagy, \"The Contribution of the Arts to Social Reconstruction\", 21. 6 Stimson, The Pivot of the World: Photography and Its Nation , 18. 120 complex to be challenged by asserting a global \"middle power\", as Lester B. Pearson, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate and soon -to-be Prime Minster , demanded; t he Canadian Centennial certainly owed to this condition of nation building. The Montreal world's fair was early imagined as a laboratory on the problems , aspirations , needs , environment , spirit , and famil y of \"man\" - categories, tinged by a pop ular embrace of existentialism that equally coloured Team 10's apparent rejection of CIAM rationalism, redolent of the ways in which culture, elevated by ideas on and sentiments of a new postwar subjectivity, would, here by virtue of an urbanistic demand, constitute a new public sphere. 7 Just as in the van Ginkels' 1959 CMHC design exhibition prospectus or the counterforms of Man in the City, artistic and social imaginaries were, it was believed, fundamentally intertwined. Thus, again, the Brains Trust. The architects' ideals - to define the exhibition as arising from uniquely new aesthetic, social, and technological possibilities - would crystallise at the famed Montebello Conference. In late May 1963, a select group of leading Canadian intellectuals , chosen from a list of one hundred eminent thinkers for \"their depth of culture and originality of thought\", gathered inside the august Seigniory Club in the picturesque village of Montebello, Quebec, to define the very ethos of the Montreal world exhibition. I n journalistic accounts, popular histories, and official reports, Montebello would be elevated to the status of myth, regularly given the distinction of having invented Terre des Hommes as 7 Stimson, The Pivot of the World: Photography and Its Nation , 19. Stimson notes the 1962 publication of Jurgen Habermas's book The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere: An Inquiry into a Category of Bourgeois Society translated into English until 1989, Habermas's book is symptomatic of postwar efforts to elevate culture to a level of public, thus political, discourse. 121 theme, thus of creating the exhibition ex nihilo. While mistaken - Terre des Hommes owed, of course, to the January PQAA retreat and earlier discussions in the van Ginkels' circle - the statement, incessantly repeated until the fair's completion, indicated, first, how little t he original deliberations had circulated outside Montreal, and, second, the need to establish a popular sense of origins.8 That the world's fair could be seen arising from a host of concerns - advancements in science, elevation of the arts, rise of new un iversities, and bases of a bilingual nation - was to ensure publicly that the grand gesture of the Centennial was truly a homegrown but worldly project. As newspaper headlines reported, \"Le Colloque des '12' a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'Exposition sa Grande Charte\". 9 Privately, the conferees would work tirelessly to buttress the theme against its cooption by narrow political interests. The members of the Montebello Conference were appointed by the Board of Governors for Canadian Corporation for the World Exhibition. Ala n Jarvis, Director of the Canadian Conference on the Arts, Wilder Penfield, the ground -breaking neurosurgeon known in his lifetime as \"the greatest living Canadian\", and Gabrielle Roy, the acclaimed French Canadian author, joined colleagues from the arts, sciences, and law. Among them 8 The Canadian Architect and the Journal of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada, the main organs of architecture culture, featured the PQAA event in their respective March and April issues. Terre des Hommes/Man and His World , a widely circulating and popular book officially published by the Canadian Corporation for the World Exhibition at the close of Expo 67, would, in a preface by the Montebello conferee and famed author Gabrielle Roy, make Montebello the source of Terre des Hommes. In April 1963, Michel Chevalier could suggest that \"identification with the exhibition hardly exists outside Montreal, or possibly the Province of Quebec\" while insisting that it was already \"one of the great Canadian undertakings - to rival the C.P.R.\" - the transcontinental railroad completed in 1885 - \"and the [St '12' a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'Exposition sa Grande Charte\", La Presse (Montreal, 25 May 1963): 3, 6. 122 were the Montreal architects Victor Prus and Raymond Affleck, who had respectively chaired the sessions on Mise -en-Sc\u00e8ne and M\u00e9thodes at the PQAA retreat, and Claude Robillard, the recently appointed exhibition master planner (seconded from his role as Director of the Montreal City Planning Department) and the van Ginkels' ally, who had rendered \"Man and His World\" as Terre des Hommes while retroactively couching it Antoine de Saint- Exup\u00e9ry's book. Their participation continu ed the mission to transform Terre des Hommes into constituent themes and architectural plans. Arguing in terms of the universalising nature of undertakings like The Family of Man , the Montebello group called for a project of \"transhumanism\". This was not , the conferees decided, something that fully existed; it was, rather, an idea, a feeling, felt emerging in human consciousness and requiring concrete expression. Transhumanism had been outlined only a few years earlier by the British evolutionary biologist Julian Huxley. Descended from a distinguished family of scientists (his grandfather Thomas Henry Huxley was a friend and supporter of Charles Darwin) and intellectuals (his brother being the novelist Aldous Huxley), Huxley had been the force behind the \"modern evolutionary synthesis\", the union of biological ideas shaping a widely accepted account of natural selection. He was, moreover, an internationalist, the first Director -General of UNESCO in 1946, and a prominent populariser of science to the public by the 1950s. 10 Huxley's humanism drew on his abiding belief in evolutionary theory, thus in progress (a notion that would condition the 10 On Huxley's framing of UNESCO, see: Huxley, U NESCO: its Purpose and its Philosophy (Washington Public Affairs Press, 1948) . Following his work with UNESCO, Huxley helped to found the World Wildlife Fund. 123 Montebello deliberations).11 Believing that humankind could better itself through science and technology - \" The scientific and technical explorations have given the Common Man all over the world a notion of physical possi bilities\" - Huxley posited, The new understanding of the universe has come about through the new knowledge amassed in the last hundred years - by psychologists, biologists, and other scientists, by archaeologists, a nthropologists, and historians. It has defined m an's responsibility and destiny - to be an agent for the rest of the world in the job of realizing its inherent potentialities as fully as possible. 12 This deeply modern experien ce and consciousness - which matched the historical arc borrowed by the van Ginkels from Giedion and coincided with the Canadian centennial - was, for Huxley, intimately tied to improving the social environment; any agency provoking change - that is, social benefit - was essentially \"good\" . 13 Huxley had in fact written TVA: Adventure in Planning , published by The Architectural Press in Great Britain in 1943, which 11 The author Gabrielle Roy, a members of the Montebello conference, described \"faith in progress\" as an abiding concern among the Montebello group: \"Rather than the acquisition of more material and spiritual ease, progress should signify an increasingly equitable human distribution of misfortune and advantage. To progress then would mean to work to ward a gradual 'rapprochement' of all men of every condition and origin.\" See: Roy, \"The Theme Unfolded by Gabrielle Roy\", Terre des hommes. Man and His World (Ottawa: Canadian Corporation for t he 1967 World Exhibition, 1967), 26. 12 Julian Huxley, \"Tran shumanism\", in New Bottles for New Wine (London: Chatto & Windus, 1957 ), 13-17; reprinted as Knowledge, Morality, Destiny (New York: Mentor, 1960). Huxley's \"transhumanism\" extended to defending the French Jesuit -palaeontologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin , who he believed had been unfairly maligned by the Catholic hierarchy for accepting evolution ary theory and coining the idea of \"Omega Point\" (an evolutionary moment culminating in some supreme consciousness). Huxley wrote the introduction to Teilhard 's The Phenomenon of Man (1959). Lending gravitas to their deliberations, the Montebello conferees concluded their proposal on the Expo 67 theme by quoting Teilhard ; see: \"The Theme 'Terre des Hommes' and its Development at the Canadian World Exhibition in M ontreal, 1967\", Report of the Montebello 1990- Gagnon, Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal. Huxley defended the ideals of democracy, humanism, and science in a series of books - including Man in the Modern World (London: Chatto & Windus, 1947) - written during and immediately after the Second World War. Given its publication date, his 1961 book The Humanist Frame may well have influenced the Expo 67 architects. 13 Peter Medawar, \"Evolutionary Hu manism\", in Alan Bullock and Oliver Stallybrass, eds., The Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought (London: Fontana Books, 1977), 219. 124 sympathetically detailed the regional planning efforts - shown in countless photographs of dams, parks, and new homes - of the Tennessee Valley Authority: \"The initials TVA are beginning to be familiar as the symbol of a new possibility for the democratic countries - the possibility of obtaining the efficiency of a co -ordinated plan without totalitarian regimentation.\"14 Here given clear architectural and urbanistic contour, transhumanism was a riposte to authoritarianism but stood for the statist control of resources - \"planning\" - as necessary to popular democracy. Inspired by Huxley, the Montebello group declared: Modern man is transcending the boundaries which so long contained and directed his spiritual and material aspirations. He must impose on the world of 1967 new concepts of community, permitting unity and harmony between peoples to develop within their external diversities and in a spirit of respect for the human personality. The knowledge he has acquired of the world around him has brought modern man to a point where, having learned to escape the law of universal gravitation, the abilities he has developed now impel him to attack the evils which heretofore have been part and parcel of his existence: hunger and thirst, anxiety and war, suffering an disease, cold and drought, degrading labour, natural disaster, etc. 15 Against the horrors of war and disease, the march of science and technology - outer space having been reached in the years between Huxley's \"Transhumanism\" essay and the Montebello conference - brought not only the mechanisms for but a consciousness of social change . If some architectural idea was emerging, then it arose in the suggestion of imposing \"new concepts of community\". At the level of the \"world\", this meant a polemical definition 14 Julian Huxley, TVA: Adventure in Planning (Cheam, Great Britain: The Architectural Press, 1943), 7. Huxley's sentiment n eatly coincided with the exact moment that British and Canadian planners began imagining postwar urbanism. The MARS group, the British CIAM chapter, had issued its plan for London in 1942. While the British looked, in part, to solving wartime destruction of cities, Canadian efforts - among the very first instances of modernism in the country - were largely focused on housing and regional planning. 15 \"The Theme 'Terre des Hommes' and its Development at the Canadian World Exhibition in Montreal, 1967\", Report of the Montebello Conference 1990- 07-001, Fonds Gilles Gagnon, Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal. 125 of themes challenging established political orders by \" transcending the boundaries\" of cultures and nations. Before explaining just what this architectural space might be, the Montebello group insisted on a further evocation of transhumanism. They returned to Saint-Exup\u00e9ry. Noting that Terre des Hommes , the title of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's book, \"has been chosen as the central motif\", the \"intent will be to examine the behaviour of man in his environment, extolling this achievements in the fields of ideas, culture and science\".16 As such, One of the principle ideas contained in \"Terre des Hommes\" is the exaltation of man's occupation. St. Exup\u00e9ry [sic ] speaks of its importance on almost every page; \"The requirements of an occupation transform and enrich the world.\" \"The grandeur of an occupation lies perhaps most of all in its ability to unite men.\" The fair will show men at their work: men chosen from various occupations, some humble and undistinguished.... Thus, The striking complexity of a group working together should be communicated - from the small team formed by a mason and a carpenter to the group of 20,000 required to launch man into space. \"To be a man,\" said St. Exup\u00e9ry [ sic], \"is to feel that one's own stone contributes to building the edifice of the world.\" 17 The closing phrase later would be ceaselessly quoted as the exhibition's motif. For now, the emphasis on the complexity of work was expressly to convey Robillard's argument against technology as artefact: \"I thought the time was over when we could have world exhibitions of 16 Ibid. 17 Ibid., 8. Saint -Exup\u00e9ry's words were abridged from a passage in which he described \"The Men\", the pioneering p ilots to which he belonged: \"To be a man is, precisely, to be responsible. It is to feel shame at the sight of what seems to be unmerited misery. It is to take pride in a victory won by one's comrades. It is to feel, when setting one's stone, that one i s contributing to the building of the world.\" See: Antoine de Saint - Exup\u00e9ry , , trans. Lewis Galanti \u00e8re (1939; London: Heinemann, 1954), 49. 126 the latest screwdriver, and that it was time the accent was placed on man rather than on his inventions.\"18 Saint -Exup\u00e9ry's definition of \"man\", not necessarily doctrinal and always vaguely spiritual, stressed the power of the creative imagination, the importance of fraternal bonds, the appeal of moral idealism, and the organic rootedness of culture (often rurality); his resulting ideal society was to be curiously liberated from machinery and industry, a paradoxical evocation for someone whose fame was associated with aviation. 19 Borrowing from this sense of humankind's collective shaping of its environment, the Montebello committee would request, to no avail, \"that the English translation be 'Man in His World' rather than 'Man and His World'.\"20 The notion of being immersed \"in\" things was to resist any sense of the \"world\" as a mediated appendage to \"man\". The liberal humanism of the theme aimed at arousing emotion, to attract but also to disturb, while remaining educational even as some millenarian impulse was awakened: The Canadian World Exhibition, unlike preceding exhibitions, will lay considerably less stress on contemporary technical advances. It will be concerned more with the craftsman than with his tools ; it will be centred around man as he works to achieve his destiny and as he carries out his myr iad occupations on earth.21 18 Claude Robillard quoted in Pierre Berton, 1967: The Last Good Year (Toronto: Doubleday Canada Ltd, 1997), 258. 19 S.

Never acknowledged, it drew on Saint -Exup\u00e9ry's opening chapter of Terre des Hommes , \"La Ligne\", or \"The Craft\", which here stood for the skill of flying.22 The pilot was not to be classed \"with toreadors and gamblers\", risk -takers heedlessl y contemptuous of death.23 Rather, the pilot- like the preferred examples of the shepherd, the peasant farmer, or the village craftsman - serving la ligne was to be judged as fulfilling a greater purpose. As aviator for the Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale A\u00e9ropostale , Saint -Exup\u00e9ry repeatedly evoked the urgency of delivering les postes no matter the conditions; the lesson was one of overcoming narrow self -interest and serving some greater common ideal. The very idea of the airline, as a network of communications, was, therefore, raised to an idea on human fraternity and community.24 Modernity was evinced not in the supremacy of technology but in its capacity progressively to narrow differences between peoples. Thus, the airplane - \"The Tool\" - became a crucial symbol. On the one hand, Saint -Exup\u00e9ry looked warily at the advance of instrumental technology, fearing its dehumanising capacity. On the other hand, he insisted that \"thanks to the metal, and by 22 La ligne was also shorthand for Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Lignes Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re, Wind, Sand and Stars , 49. 24 S.

And it is this very thing that the machine helps them to do! It begins by annihilating time and space.26 The collapse of peoples - considered not in racial terms but by bonds of fellowship - was irrevocably tied to the rediscovery, granted by technology, of the world. The Montebello deliberations, free from nostalgic evocations of craftspeople and their products, were couched in a repeated refrain of \"exploration\": \"This spirit of challenge and questioning, rather [than] a self -satisfied sense of achievement, should also animate t he presentation of all thematic material.\"27 There would be neither an appeal to a mythic past nor an acceptance of arriving at a historical plateau: not \"a museum of inventions\" but \" language ... from ideograms, the alphabet, algebra, graphic symbols, up to the symbolic codes of chemistry, electronics, road signs and others\"; the goal was \"not to set up a general Museum of Man\" - \"We do not envisage a pantheon of thinkers, artists, saints of champions\" - but to offer \"a vivid representation of the exercises of craft occupations as they relate to different societies\". 28 Again, the craft s were any number of ways and means - ideas and technologies - by which 25 Saint -Exup\u00e9ry , Wind, Sand and Stars , 55. 26 Saint -Exup\u00e9ry , Wind, Sand and Stars , 56. When describing the experience o f flying, Saint -Exup\u00e9ry consistently subordinate d the power of the machine to that of natural phenomena : \"Air and water, and not machinery, are the concern of the hydroplane pilot about to take off \"(59). 27 \"The Theme 'Terre des Hommes' and its Developmen t at the Canadian World Exhibition in Montreal, 1967\", 12. 28 Ibid., 9, 7. 129 people were changing the world. As much as things (artefacts) were important - there was, after all, a di dactic purpose of communicating to a mass public - emphasis was to be placed on processes of scientific and artistic discovery. \"Exploration\" - leitmotif of Huxley's transhumanism: \" exploration of human nature and its possibilities has scarcely begun. A v ast New World of uncharted possibilities awaits its Columbus.\" - was, adumbrated by the Montebello group's respective disciplines , to be the overarching theme: Human exploration, whether it be of the earth or of the mind, past, present, or future affords unusual opportunities for significant exhibits. Biological and physical research, the development of medical therapy or of mechanized, the visual and auditory arts, all these are explorations peculiar to the different members of the family of nations. Mo lecular biology, the theory of stress, the techniques of neurosurgery and the problems of longevity are fields of modern research that have special interest and actuality. It should be emphasized that scientific research is not the only form of exploration in which man is engaged today. Humanity is also devoting many of its resources to research in the field of culture and ideas. 29 The mapping of human endeavour - the conferees now identified \"Man the Explorer\" as agent of the theme - could realign very d ifferent engagements of the world. Transhumanism also meant illustrating \"examples of collective transnational undertakings \". To display the efforts of these kinds of undertakings - namely UNESCO - was to prove \"the need for expanded systems of governmen t\"; this would, in turn, \"point up the archaic lack of functionalism in certain types of government and the newly discovered value 29 Julian Huxley, \"Transhumanism\", in New Bottles for New Wine (London: Chatto & Windus, 1957), 13 -17, reprinted as Knowledge, Morality, Destiny (New York: Mentor, 1960); \"The Theme 'Terre des Hommes' and its Development at the Canadian World Exhibition in Montreal, 1967\", 6. 130 of supranational governments .\"30 Lest any ambiguity have remained in the radical political suggestion, the Montebello group e mphatically declared: The entire development of the Exhibition on the site shall reflect the premacy [sic] given to human values and aspirations in the theme \" Terre des Hommes\". It must not be presented as a \"Terre des n ations\" or a \"Terre des machines.\"31 It was, in short, the eclipse of nations and corporations. The lack of functionalism evinced in outmoded forms of governance could very well have been an architectural critique. The sentiment soon ca me to define the ideal - but short -lived - master pla n. It was the status of humans and not necessarily their objects that was to be terms of critique, thus display. There was, pace the van Ginkels, a residue of Team 10 theory - namely, an insistence on reintroducing into modern architecture the experience of \"community\"; this was meant to resist the social \"mass\" as the departure point for design by substituting the figure of \"man\" when solving \"problems of the human habitat\" (the theme of the 1956 CIAM congress prepared by Team 10). In similar terms, the Montebello group drew on Saint -Exup\u00e9ry to offer the dis -alienation of \"man\" from the \"world\" via themes confronting the supremacy of instrumental technology by the liberative force of creative work. That this indicated some conceptual affinity to Hannah Arendt's notion on \" vita activa\" was likely not accidental given the popularity of her 1958 book The Human 30 \"The Theme 'Terre des Hommes' and its Development at the Canadian World Exhibition in Montreal, 1967\", 9. 31 Ibid., 2. The wording stemmed from a subcommittee that included both Affleck and Robillard, who had been present at the PQAA retreat; see: Claude Robillard, Jean -Louis , Series D03.9 -109-26-TD, Fond s Guy Desbarats, Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal. 131 Condition . In this study on modern humanity and political freedom, Arendt designated three activities as fundamental to a vita activa: labour , which \"corresponds to the biological processes of the human body\" and as private and impermanent aims only at the renewal of life; work , which \"corresponds to the unnaturalness of human existence\" and as public and permanent provides an artificial world of thin gs; and action , \"the only activity that goes on between men without the intermediary of things and matter\" - thus corresponding, in terms of Terre des H ommes , to the condition of \"plurality, to the fact that men, not Man, live on the earth and inhabit the world.\"32 Action was, therefore, political activity; but work produced homo faber , an agent of modern life and consciousness responsible for producing the \"world of things\": \"If animal laborans needs the help of homo faber to ease his labor and remove his pain, and if mortals need his help to erect a home on earth\" - at Montebello, an echo of Saint -Exup\u00e9ry's exhortation on \"building the edifice of the world\" - \"acting and speaking men need the help of homo faber in his highest capacity, that is, the help of the artist, of poets and historiographers, of monument- builders or writers, because without them the only product of their activity the story they enact and tell, would not survive at all.\"33 The resulting suggestion of some kind of tangible public realm - \"the human artifice must be a place fit for action and speech\" - fit the discursive framework of the world exhibition (with its origin in Man in t he City ) and its agents: \"monument-builders\", or architects. Just as Arendt had insisted that \"the measure can be neither the driving necessity of biological life 32 Hannah Ardent, The Human Condition (1958; Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1998), 7 -9; Kenneth Frampton, \"The Status of Man and the Status of His Object\", Architectural Design 7/8 (1982): 7. 33 Ardent, The Human Condition, 173. 132 and labor nor the utilitarian instrumentalism of fabrication and usage\", the Montebello group imagined an exhibition defined by \"man\" responsible not only for creating \"tools, arts, science, rules of moral behaviour\" but the \" powerful method of scientific research \". 34 A subcommittee including the architects Robillard and Affleck put it succinctly: \"Man and his many metiers is a major component of 'Terre des Hommes' and the Montreal Fair provides a unique and timely opportunity to express this aspect of the human condition.\" 35 The world's fair was, in other words, to communicate ever-changing relations between peoples and things, thus privileging inquiry and debate as bulwark against, again, the determi nations of nations and machines. In setting exploration as theme , the Montebello group's use of Saint -Exup\u00e9ry introduced, however unknowingly, a unique vision on modern architecture. Saint -Exup\u00e9ry and his pioneering aviator friend Jean Mermoz had flown Le Corbusier over North Africa and South America during an especially fertile period , beginning in the late 1920s, of his considerations on urbanism.36 The airplane was early upheld by Le Corbusier as gestalt entity of functionalism; his famous phrase \"Th e house is machine for living in\" was, in fact, preceeded by the observation that \"The airplane is a product of close selection\", thus \"The 34 \"The Theme 'Terre des Hommes' and its Development at the Canadian World Exhibition in Montreal, 1967\", 6 -7. 35 Robillard, et al., \"Report 24, Michel \"Position Papers Theme Development No. 1\" 17th, 1963): 7, Box 27 -A21-04, Fonds van Ginkel, Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal. 36 Le Corbusier also flew with the aviator Fran\u00e7ois Durafour over the Atlas Mountains. In Terre des Hom mes, Saint -Exup\u00e9ry writes movingly of Mermoz's courage and skill as a pilot when describing his disappearance at sea in December 1936. 133 lesson of the airplane lies in the logic which governed the statement of the problem and its realization.\"37 The aes thetico -formalist argument , on perfected mechanical forms described by the criteria evolutionary biology, would change as Le Corbusier took to the air. From above, the world appeared to Saint -Exup\u00e9ry and Le Corbusier as an abstract and perfectly ordered v isual pattern punctuated by cities appearing as indistinct foci to be discovered only upon landing.38 Like Saint- Exup\u00e9ry, Le Corbusier found in the synoptic aerial view - whether taken over the Maghreb or flying between Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo, and Monte video - a profound pathos owing to a perceived fissure between the rootless character of modern technology (here paradoxically affording initiation to the cosmic laws governing the universe) and the rootedness of pre-industrial cultures. 39 Nevertheless, th e freedom of movement - \"The airplane flies direct from one point to another indifferent to the contours of the earth\", he declared in his book Aircraft of 1935 - gave lessons on an urbanism capable of overcom ing alienation from nature: the forceful vistas of endlessly winding rivers in Brazil - \"a vast programme of organic town planning came like a revelation\" - were suddenly rendered as viaduct cities following a new \"law of the meander\" and extending over the landscape with Olympian force (fig. 3.2). 40 Beyond previous modernist technologies of 37 Le Corbusier, Towards a New Architecture , (1923; New York: Dover, 1986) , 107. 38 Davide Deriu, \"The Ascent of the Modern Planeur : Aerial Images and Urban Imaginary in the 1920s\", in Christian Emden, Catherine Keen, and David Midgley, eds., Imagining the City Vol. 1: The Art of Urban Living (Oxford UK: Peter Lang, 2006), 201. 39 Kenneth Frampton, Le Corbusier (London: Tham es & Hudson, 2001), 107; von Le Corbusier: Elements of a Synthesis ( Cambridge MA: The MIT 289 -290. Aircraft Corbusier , 107. Corbusier described his \"law of the meander\" in Precisions: On the Present State of 134 vision, whether panoramic or panoptical (modes of beholding central to world's fairs), the aerial view gave sense of an Archimedean point at which the world could be observed as a totality and transformed. (To a pr evious generation, this had been the apocalyptic realisation of death from above; Le Corbusier had, in La Ville Radieuse, fantastically rendered tall buildings as preternaturally resistant to aerial bombardment. To a newer generation, like those gathered at Montebello, and notwithstanding the fear of invisible air bursts of thermonuclear weapons detonated far above the earth, it was now a more hopeful vision bestowed by an awareness of the Earth as seen from outer space; indeed, Arendt's opening to The Hum an Condition was the mention of Sputnik.) Thus the viaduc autostrade that, simultaneously conforming to and confronting the landscape, displaced the abstract division of space assumed in The Athens Charter : it was precisely this kind of architecture that Daniel van Ginkel had, when describing an architecture of movement, upheld as paradigm for contemporary works like Kenzo Tange's Tokyo Bay plan, not least given the well -known bird's eye views of a model forcefully juxtapos ing the lin ear city across water and land, with its distant reaches extending into the landscape as if vascular lines of a leaf (fig. 3.3). Still, if the view from the air was to expose the limits of town planning, then it was also to neutralise the boundaries of political power. Le Cor busier had sensed as much (and likely saw himself in the mould of a pioneering aviator). Like Saint -Exup\u00e9ry, he was seduced by the double vision of analysis and revelation: in the temps nouveaux of a second machine age, the ancient Architecture and City Planning , trans. by Edith Schreiber Aujame (1930; Cambridge MA: The MIT Press, 1991), 142. 135 concentric city, which continued to exist into the twentieth century, would be rendered obsolete by geomorphic structures reaching across the land.41 The seedbed of \"transhumanism\", or \"Man and His World\", lay precisely in this ability to envision entirely new kinds of geopoliti cal alignments. The terrestrial projection was finally to lend the world exhibition an architectural plan. Arendt's Archimedean point - defined as revealing, on the one hand, an awe-inspiring view onto the world and, on the other hand, a techno-science reducing all human activity to process - was couched in understanding \"that both despair and triumph are inherent in the same event.\" 42 Thus, If one wishes to draw a distinctive line between the modern age and the world we have come to live in, he may wel l find it in the difference between a science which looks upon nature from a universal standpoint and thus acquires a universal mastery over her, on the one hand, and a truly \"universal\" science, on the other, which imports cosmic processes into nature eve n at the obvious risk of destroying her and, with her, man's mastership over her. 43 Recognising that the very same destructive power was also a creative one, the Montebello members noted, when drawing on Saint -Exup\u00e9ry's idea that some kind of omniscient view could both parse and unite the attributes of \"man\", that the world exhibition could express the liberative aspects of science while revealing instances of human misery. This conjoined sense of \"exploration\", as facet of transhumanism , would, in a discu rsive step critical to the 41 M. Christine Boyer, \"Aviation and the Aerial View: Le Corbusier's Spatial Transformations in the 1930s and 1940s\", Diacritics (Autumn -Winter 2003): 96. 42 Ardent, The Human Condition, 262. 43 Ibid., 268. 136 future exhibition, find the Montebello delegates updating the van Ginkels' original categories of \"man\" ( problems , aspirations , environment , spirit , and family ) with the new concept of a \"Theme Area\". This \"precinct\" woul d announce \"THE EARTH, HOME OF MANKIND (MYSTERES DE LA PLANETE)\" in \"a grand entry hall\" feeding into \"three major halls leading one to the other\" - showing \"The earth and space\", \"The resources of the earth\", and \"The problems of man on the earth\" - with \"satellite rooms branching off it, where subordinate aspects of the theme could be entrusted to large industrial corporations\". 44 The spirit of subordinating things like corporations to a theme was to define the master plan. This meant, first, a Place des peuples \"organized in such a way that all nations, large or small, will be represented with more or less the same importance and space\".45 To the planner Robillard and the architect Affleck, it also meant a Place du Canada conceived not as an architectura l contrivance but in terms of moral agency granting ways to spatialise the fair: \"Canada should undertake the financing, organizing and construction of a significant number of exhibition precincts related devoted to definite aspects of the theme\".46 Canadian nationhood - a project considered only 100 years old, thus made truly modern - was to encapsulate global concerns - \"based on significance to manking [ sic] as opposed to Canadiana\", as another report soon insisted - by exhibiting three things: the \"development of the Arctic lands in relation to human population and production\", the \"phenomenon of 44 \"The Theme 'Terre des Hommes' and its Development at the Canadian World Exhibition in Montreal, 1967\", 4 -5. 45 Ibid., 3. 46 Ibid., 2ff. 137 the urbanization of mankind and the questions it raises about the possibilities of the 'ideal city' as against the present reality\", and the \"development of arid lands, also in relation to the population explosion\". 47 Together, these unfolding facets - themes and sub -themes - of \"Man the Explorer\" would actualise the master plan: \"each of these precincts might be thought of as a small campus\" but \" maintenance of urban coherence within and between precincts must be a primary visual aim \".48 In a sense, the dialectic of fragmented cultures or landscapes (the places, perhaps, of animal laborans ) and their unification under the aviator's omniscient view (the acts of ho mo faber ), as gleaned from Saint -Exup\u00e9ry (or seen in Arendt's Archimedean point), was made the method of realising the exhibition architecture. The \"precincts\" preserved an idea developed months earlier by Affleck and the van Ginkels . They had envisione d themes serving as \"components\" \"single structure\", \"a group of buildings\", or compound\".49 The spatial implication, updated at Montebello, was clear: architectures registered at the critical mass - the public space - of the city. There was something more. It was a recollection, however faint, of the nineteenth -century structures meant to inspire ideas on the Montreal exhibition: engineered, modular, prefabricated architectures reorganising \"man\" by the qualitative equalisation of \"things\" - the \" world \" synthesised in miniature by appropriately massive forms. 47 Robillard et al., \"Report of Sub- Committee #3\", 4. 48 \"The Theme 'Terre des Hommes' and its Development at the Canadian World Exhibition in Montreal, 1967\", 2 -3. 49 R. Affleck, Michel 39- 1991- 02-005, Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal. Well before the seminal Montebello conference, these Montreal architects had identified \"Man and His World\" as an organising principle. 138 ISLANDS Convened by the CCWE, Montebello defined the world's fair. The twelve members \" de grande envergure \" were f\u00eated for their wisdom.50 Their Grande Charte was circulated in the two national languages, translated into Spanish, Italian, German, and Russian, and immediately sent to 150 countries and international agencies. Terre des Hommes was made the unifying motif. \"Transhumanism\" became the basis of formally inviting nations to join in 1967. The Universal and World Exhibition would, in a masterstroke of marketing, be rechristened Expo 67. There was, however, a note of hesitation, even desperation. The Montebello group, not least Robillard and Affleck, had concluded its deliberations by insisting on the city as measure: \"Montreal and its environs provide a uniquely challenging and exciting site for a Universal Exhibition, if the 'sense of place' is to be realized to its full potential\". 51 Asking that the fair be linked to \"the complex life of the city itself\", the conferees echoed Louis Kahn's earlier endorsement of the PQAA proposals when recognising the St Lawrence River as staging the site. Kahn had seen the river in heroic terms with a series of gateways leading from it to the exh ibition, thus to the city. It was partly a statement on his \"viaduct architecture\" but otherwise a confirmation of the van Ginkels' preferred site of Point-Saint - 50 \"Le colloque des '12' a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'Exposition sa Grande Presse 6; Devoir (Montreal, 25 May 1963). 51 \"The Theme 'Terre de s Hommes' and its Development at the Canadian World Exhibition in Montreal, 1967\", 13. 139 Charles, a riverside working class district officially slated for slum clearance that had appeared as a major node in t heir Man in the City proposal ( which had been sent to the BIE, was now on display in the CCWE offices, and encapsulated the sites preferred by Robillard's City Planning Department).52 Yet the Montebello delegates did not press fur ther. The river was only to orchestrate an \"arrangement of vistas looking outward form the Exhibition site itself\" - or to be seen from boats. The mood was uncharacteristically picturesque. The architects had counted on the authority of city as crystall ising the future needs of \"man\". Urbanism was made a moral imperative. Kahn's approval was soon followed by that of Andr\u00e9 Wogenscky , the French architect and formerly the head of Le Corbusier's atelier . Visiting Montreal shortly after the PQAA retreat and speaking publicly the Club des Beaux Arts, Wogenscky argued for building in an old area without historical interest and, as the Montreal Star reported, \"urged World's Fair planners to build 'an ultra -modern city within a city' for 1967 - instead of the 'grand visual cacophony' into which such exhibitions usually blossom.\" 53 It was, of course, the van Ginkels' Man in the City, now contextualised by someone responsible for transforming La Ville Radieuse into works like the Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation. Yet in their appeals to modern architecture , the architects had discounted the authority of \"visual cacophony\" - of spectacle. Here, they encountered a mayor's 52 Guy R. Legault, La ville qu'on a b\u00e2tie: Trente ans au service de l'urbanisme et de l'habitation \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al 1956 - 1986 (Montreal: Editions Liber, \"World's Fair Planners Urged to Build Own City\", The Montreal Star (February 1963). 140 machinations. Jean Drapeau had, ever since winning the world's fair, distanced himself Man in the City. Steadfast in his belief that Montreal was the veritable metropole of Canada, Drapeau saw the world exhibition, with the Centennial made an international event, as cementing his city's legacy. Thus the site: in the months leading from the PQAA retreat to Mon tebello, Drapeau began removing the fair from the city. He turned to an opportune study prepared by the Port of Montreal, which held Pointe -Saint -Charles - among the slum clearance areas of the van Ginkels' Man in the City scheme - as its extended territo ry and insisted that any expropriation would not only be prohibitive but have to be returned following the exhibition. 54 The dissuasion came with a suggestion: to enlarge three islands lying in the St Lawrence River and facing the downtown skyline and to provide a new bridge leading westward to Mackay Pier, a harbourfront site. 55 Entirely removed from the urban fabric, the dramatic vista was admirably suited to Drapeau's penchant for the grand gesture. The mayor immediately petitioned Prime Minister John D iefenbaker by announcing the discovery of an especially economical site, claiming the full support of the CCWE Commissioners Paul Bienvenu and Cecil Carsley (corporate leaders who were, in fact, the federal government's appointees), and believing the islands could only offer \" des possibilit\u00e9s illimites a l'imagination des architectes qui pr\u00e9pareront l'am\u00e9nagement to Mr C.F. Carsley, Deputy Commi ssioner S3, D91, Fonds du Comit\u00e9 ex\u00e9cutif, City of Montreal Archives, Montreal. Beaudet was Manager of the National Harbours Board in Montreal; resolutely opposed to the Pointe -Saint -Charles site, he convinced Drapeau to look elsewhere. 55 \"The National Harbours Board Report of March 3, 1963\" Series 27- A21-06, Fonds 141 l'Exposition \".56 With Bienvenu and Carsley entirely reticent toward the islands and the architects firmly committed to Man in the City, it was a remarkable sleight-of -hand. It was, however, perfectly timed, with the Conservative Diefenbaker fighting a bitter campaign ahead the federal election in April 1963; he quickly cabled his agreement.57 In late March, exactly two months after the PQAA congress, the islands site was officially announced in Montreal newspapers.58 Drapeau had maneuvered wilily. In full control of the City Council, he had also convinced the provincial Minister of Municipal Affairs to cede the surrounding waters , thus the new islands, to Montreal.59 The Journal of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada could only dryly observe : In approving Mayor Drapeau's proposal, St Helens Island, Federal and Provincial government authorities have not lost sight of the political implications the 56 Jean Drapeau, Letter to the Tr \u00e8s Honorable John G. Diefenbaker (25 March 1963): 4, P67, D17, Collection compagnie de l 'Exposition universelle de 1967 , City of Montreal Archives, Montreal. Sensitive to growing French nationalism in Quebec, the CCWE - an arm of the Canadian government - would repeatedly note that both Bienvenu and Carsley - who occupied positions of enormous power in leading industrial and financial concerns - were bilingual; see: \"Bienvenu And Carsley Named To World's Fair Posts\", Montreal Gazette (January 19, 1963): 1. 57 Apropos Drapeau's island s, the Prime Minister noted that the inter -governmental agreement, which had stipulated that any exhibition be mounted in the city, would be changed; see: \"Diefenbaker t\u00e9l\u00e9graphie\", La Presse (Montreal, 29 March 1963): 26. 58 Albert Tremblay and Raymond Masse, \"L'Expo 1967: sur le fleuve\", La Presse (Montreal, 29 March 1963): 1, 26 - H\u00e9l\u00e8ne \", Le Devoir (Montreal, 25 March 1963): 1- 2; Al Palmer, \"Point St. Charle s Would Cost $80,000,000, Couldn't Be Done in Time. Objections to other Sites Explained\", The Montreal Gazette (29 March, 1963): 9. 59 \"L'emplacement l'Exposition universelle juridiction \", Le Devoir (Montreal, 30 April 1963 ). Minister of Municipal Affairs Minister Pierre Laporte's finally appropriate d land belonging to St Lambert, a municipality opposite Montreal on the south shore of the St Lawrence River , thus allowing the islands to be created. Elected in 1960 Lapor te's Liberal government was at the height of the Quiet Revolution, the epochal modernisation of Quebec society that had in Expo 67 a ready symbol. The Port of Montreal's suggestion of the islands was, in fact, preceded an independent study proposing exact ly the same sites by the very same means; see: B\u00e9dard, Charbonneau et Langlois, \" Projet d' Emplacement l' Exposition Universelle Internationale de 1967 \", Architecture -B\u00e2timent- Construction (Montreal, January 1963): 22 -27. 142 selection of a site was bound to arouse. Not only is St Helen's Island on the main axis of the predominantly French -speaking east end (a factor could have had some bearings before a certain chilly April day), but part of the land to be reclaimed around the islands falls under jurisdiction of South Shore's St Lambert, thus giving newly appointment Minister of Municipal Affairs, Pierre Laporte, an opportunity to lead mediation over an issue involving the temperamental metropolis. 60 Federal political parties contesting an election against the backdrop of Quebec's R\u00e9volution tranquille - the newly unfolding project of secularisation, a welfare state, and nationalist politics - were attuned to a restive Quebec divided along linguistic lines. Drapeau had begun his career crusading against the vice and corruption he assumed festering in insalubrious quartiers , for which the instruments urban renewal were, he thought, ideally suited. Yet his belief, bordering on the megalomaniacal, in the supremacy of his political vision would quickly bring grandiose visions for civic monuments aligned to the \"two solitudes\" of Montreal. 61 The very real division was historically marked by the north -south axis of St Laurent Boulevard: English to the west, F rench to the east.62 Leading southward, the line invisibly marked exactly the westernmost tip of \u00cele Notre -Dame. Drapeau's enthusiasm for modern architecture was never an embrace of progressive ideals. It lay, instead, in the possibilities of grand gestures. The Montebello group, with 60 Jean Gareau, \" The 1967 Inter national Exhibition at Montreal: PQAA Discusses Concept, Theme ' Mise en Scene ' and Methods to Produce a Fair of Top Quality\", Journal of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada (April 1963): 71. Affleck and van Ginkel later privately mused: \"the City is acting independently, and probably endeavouring to keep ahead of the corporation\"; see: A. B. Nichol, \"Minutes of Meeting No. 2, Management Committee - World's Fair\" (April 15, 1963), Series D.03.9- 109-26TD, Fonds Guy Desbarats, Canadian Centre for Arch itecture, Montreal . 61 The idea was popularised in the Canadian author Hugh McLennan's allegorical novel Two Solitudes (1945). 62 The French elite and bourgeoisie was an exception, cloistered in Outremont on the south side of Mont Royal. 143 Robillard grimly accepting the islands, had publicly announced its categorical opposition to any kind of \" monument symbolique vertical, tel le 'Trylon' de la Foire de New York en 1938 [sic].\" Drapeau had once vainglorious ly hoped to relocate, albeit temporarily, the Eiffel Tower to Montreal. He remained undeterred. In December 1964, with construction on Expo 67 underway, Drapeau announce d a \"Tour de Montreal\" to be built by the cities of Montreal and Paris as \"a hyphen b etween the old world and the new.\" 63 A shrouded model, regally carried by three police constables, was marched into the City Hall chambers, where Drapeau awaited to assist in the unveiling (fig. 3.4) .64 The assembled chamber saw emerging a tapering profile akin to the Eiffel Tower and a tilt reminiscent of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The city councillors applauded, it was noted, for eight seconds. Drapeau called it his \"poem in concrete\"; it was, of course, 1,967 feet tall. Speaking directly to the televi sion cameras, he insisted that the tower would pay for itself.65 It was soon dismissed as too expensive. Notwithstanding Drapeau's machinations, the creation of the islands was an undeniably powerful event. By early July, the federal government, now under the leadership of Liberal Lester B. Pearson (the Nobel Peace Prize laureate who embraced nuclear missiles 63 Jean Drapeau qu oted in Terrance McKenna and Susan Purcell, Drapeau (Toronto and Vancouver: Clarke, Irwin & Company, 1980), 1 53. 64 Adrienne Clarkson, \" Mayor Jean Drapeau Aims for an Expo 67 T ower\", The Fifth Estate , television (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Septembe r 16, 1980). 65 John Lownsbrough, The Best Place To Be: Expo 67 and Its Time (Toronto: Penguin, 2012), 31 -32. Architects called the tower \"Drapeau's erection\". Undeterred, Drapeau finally prevailed several years later with another scheme bearing a simila r form for the 1976 Olympic Stadium ; the project, designed by the French architect Roger Taillbert, would take 30 years to pay off . 144 in his bid to unseat the Conservative Diefenbaker), approved diking operations in the St Lawrence River. \u00cele Sainte -H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, the site of an early nineteenth -century British fort, would be extended by embankments enclosing two small nearby islands, \u00cele Ronde and \u00cele Verte. \u00cele Notre Dame, entirely new and huge, would emerge from mudflats (fig. 3.5). The Mackay Pier breakwater would be transformed into Cit\u00e9 du Havre, a peninsular dep arture point to the world's fair connected to the islands by a bridge. Existing islands provided rocks for dikes shaped to manage the strong currents; sand and silt were dredged to create the land masses; a boom was built upstream to manage ice floes; the islands were equipped with water, sewer, and power systems; most spectacularly, trucks rumbled day and night bringing and dumping fill, some of it from the tunnels being excavated for the new Metro system (which would link to the Expo 67 fairgrounds). 66 In the river, a bird sanctuary was destroyed.67 Thousands of gulls, terns, ducks, and herons were seen circling the city as the geotechnical operations, as \"man\", intruded. The islands marked an end to the first effloresce nce of Expo 67 . The Parliamentary Act, which demanded an exhibition in the city itself, was amended. The BIE granted its approval to the new scheme. Bienvenu, the CCWE commissioner, attempted to resign in July and finally stepped down in August. Carsle y and Robillard soon followed suite. All had been troubled by threatening cost overruns and, especially, the abrogation of the original 66 Guy Legault, \"Choosing the Site for Expo 67\", Plan Canada (Summer 2005): 38 -39. radio (November 5, 1963 ). 145 ideals in favour of the islands.68 Bienvenu was replaced by the seventy -one year old career diplomat Pierre Dupuy (and cousin of Drapeau's wife), brought from retirement to press his old world charm and secure worldwide participation at Expo 67.69 Obliged by Parliament, Montreal was to ensure delivery of the islands to the CCWE within a year. Rarely at a loss for the thea trical, Drapeau led invited dignitaries on a river crossing to La Nuit des \u00cesles on June 30, 1964. 70 At the stroke of midnight, the guests and crowds, gathered against a backdrop of dump trucks and bulldozers, looked across the river and watched as Montrea l landmarks were lit up. On the twelfth stroke, to the thunder of fireworks, Dupuy signed the agreement: the City of Montreal would lease the island to the CCWE for the sum of one dollar a year until December 31, 1969, when the world's fair would, accordi ng to BIE rules, be entirely dismantled. To Dupuy, the islands would be \"transformed into a sanctuary of civilisation, where nations and peoples, in a spirit of competition and fraternity, will compare 68 In a meeting of the CCWE board in early May 1963, with Drapeau in attendance, Bienvenu noted that certain consulting engineers had already mentioned the impossibility of preparing the islands b y June 30, 1964. He moved that the BIE, scheduled to review the islands proposal in the coming weeks, be informed of this. With Drapeau insisting that the islands would be ready by the deadline \"or not long thereafter\", the CCWE adopted a motion that the federal government approve the islands while secretly establishing reserve sites - a proviso not to be divulged publicly. See: \" Proc\u00e8s -Verbal de la l'Exposition Universelle Canadienne\" (3 May 1963): 3, Canadian Corporation for the World Exhibition Fonds, RG71 , Library and Archives Canada, Ottawa. 69 Among his highhanded manoeuvers, Dupuy secretly invi ted Eug\u00e8ne Beaudoin, the French modern architect, to create a new master plan . Van Ginkel and his staff architects decried the manoeuver, suggesting that Beaudoin , who had designed the 1937 Paris Exposition Universelle, was somehow conservative given his professorshi p at the Ecole des Beaux- Arts in Paris. In fact, Beaudoin, with his partner Marcel Lod s, had advanced key prewar modern works including the important Maison de Peuple completed in Clichy outside Paris in 1938. Yet his classicised French embassy in Ottawa, built in 1936, may have led the Expo 67 architects to see him as retrograde. Dupuy quickly relented and claim ed the action as only a provisional study 70 \"La Nuit des \u00cesles , Programme de la remise des \u00eeles \u00e0 l'Expositi on Internationale et Universelle de 1967 \" (30 June 1963): n.p., Series VM 3, S0, D3, City of Montreal Archives, Montreal. 146 their achievements, and where the Canadian nation, es sentially young, will rise in fate up to her own destiny \".71 He later attempt ed to fashion a master plan where \"civilised nations\" - France, Britain, the United States, and Canada - would exist in their own compound . To Drapeau, it was proof \"that Montreal cannot, that Montreal will not, be shackled by lack of imagination\".72 Of the planned four square kilometres, the city delivered less than half.73 In the end, rather than ameliorate a part of the city, Drapeau would create a new piece of it. PLANS Drapeau had succeeded at keeping Expo 67 in the tradition of world's fairs - a spectacle. Montreal would not, it seemed, be a testbed of urbanism. For the architects, it was not necessarily outright injury but a withering of expectations. In March 1963, Van G inkels Associates, Architects and Planning Consultants entered a joint venture with Affleck, Desbarats, Dimakopoulos, Lebesold, Sise, Architects (also known as Arcop) as official consultants to the CCWE. They were invited by Robillard, who had joined the CCWE as Planning Director. 74 The intellectual nexus of the PQAA 71 Jacques Fauteux and Archives de Radio -Canada; http://archives.radio -canada.ca/emissions/1550, accessed 27 July 2013. 72 Ibid. \"Choosing the Site for Expo 67\" , 38-39.

The van Ginkels' immediately tried returning attention to Pointe -Saint -Charles, couching their arguments not only in the ethics of urbanism but as a financial concern.76 Their effort would prove futile. If a residual project , however avant -garde , was to remain, then it could only appear in bringing Man in the City to the islands. On May 14, 1963, the BIE gave its approval to Drapeau's islands. On the very same day, Bl anche Lemco van Ginkel mailed letters worldwide to key architects urging them to petition authorities in their home country on supporting the \"concept\" that had informed the PQAA conference.

While largely an effort at public relations, Lemco van Ginkel's letters included an architectural suggestion. When sending the PQAA report to Kenzo Tange, who the van Ginkels likely met at the final CIAM congress in 1959, she remarked, It should be noted that the \"concept\" as outlined in the paper is only a first basic idea. We believe in the principle - but the details can change with study. As for the question of national pavilions, many variations are still possible within this framework.... The bulk of expenditure we would like to see go into the functional groupings, where a country might have one or more pavilions on a particular topic, or could rent space in a central building if preferred. The van Ginkels elsewhere admitted admiring Tange's 1960 Tokyo Bay proposal and their work had absorb ed aspects of its heroic planning: an unrealised 1961 master plan for the new town of Meadowvale, Ontario, found massive pyramidal \"clusters\" of civic buildings, 77 Blanche Lemco van Ginkel, Letter to Jaap Bakema (May 14, 1963): 1, Series 27 -A2102, Fonds van Ginkel, Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal. 149 industrial sectors, and housing complexes attached to a transport spine facilitating \"as complete as possible a separation between automobile and pedestrian\" (fig. 3.6).78 Partially in the spirit of Man in the City, Meadowvale at its most heroic reflected concerns being concurrently advanced by the Japanese Metabolists for whom Tange served as \u00e9minence grise .

Thus the \"many variations\" - or \"fu nctional groupings\" - imagined possible within a \"framework\": as the van Ginkels began approaching the islands, these notions on realigning popular perceptions of cultural production took a certain utopian cast in suggesting a provisional and flexible architecture designed to challenge nation -state hegemonies. 78 H.P Daniel van Ginkel, \"Credo\", The Canadian Architect (July 1964): 46 -47. 79 Fumihiko Maki, Investigations in Collective Form (St Louis: Washington University, 1964), 5, 29ff. 80 \"Summary of Proposals for the 1967 Canadian International Exhibition at Montreal\" (no date): 1, Series 27 - A21-04, Fonds van Ginkel , Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal . Lemc o van Ginkel enclosed this two - page document, which summarised the PQAA deliberations, with her letters to architect friends. 150 Despite their unwavering resistance to the site, the islands afforded the van Ginkels a remarkable opportunity. The tabula rasa provided an ideal realm free of constraint. The existing city would n o longer be the measure of solutions but only their distant foil. The possibility of testing theories on architecture and city marked Daniel van Ginkel's newly recruited core of young designers charged with advancing the Expo 67 master plan: Ad\u00e8le Naud\u00e9, a South African \u00e9migr\u00e9 previously in Team 10 circles; Jerry Miller, a Montrealer responsible for inviting Buckminster Fuller to conduct a geodesics workshop at McGill in 1957; and Steven Staples, a white Rhodesian experienced in self -help housing with USAI D but now in voluntary exile from Ian Smith's racist regime - all of whom had, crucially, studied urban design at Harvard. 81 (They were later joined by Moshe Safdie, van Ginkel's former student, who had assisted on the Meadowvale project and would famously develop the Habitat 67 housing project.) Tasked with the physical realisation of the Expo 67 theme, the young designers, continuing a Montreal -Boston intellectual axis established by Lemco van Ginkel, would bring to bear a nexus of late CIAM thought and its critique coloured by new techniques - often in the demands for \"urban renewal\" - of imagining city space. Ever since Man in the City, the governing idea remained for all nations to be subservient to a theme - which, by extension, meant a plan. When first recalling the nineteenth century as means to reimagine their own epoch, the van Ginkels explicitly noted 81 Staples had completed the city planning degree at Harvard in 1960. Naud\u00e9 and Miller were recent graduates of its replacement p rogramme in urban design. All were previously trained as architects. 151 the 1867 Exposition Universelle. Their understanding took from Sigfried Giedion's, Space, Time and Architecture : The aim of the exhibition can be gathered from a quotation taken from an official publication of 1867: \" To make the circuit of this palace, circular, like the equator, is literally to go around the world. All peoples are here, enemies live in peace side by side. As in the beginning of things on the globe of waters, the divine spirit now floats on this globe of iron.\" 82 Engineer, sociologist, and Saint -Simonian Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric L e Play 's \"globe of iron\" , a massive ferrovitreous world museum, followed a broad ovoid plan giving an ingenious metho d of comparative study: products of the same class - heavy machinery, food, the arts - were ranged in concentric rings while the varying output of a single country traversed across seven successive zones leading from a perimeter band of restaurants to a ce ntral garden; a pathway along the long axis explained the history of the world. Travelling transversely, visitors saw the whole output of a country; journeying elliptically, they experienced cosmopolitan exhibits of a single type across different nations (fig. 3.7). The layout, suggesting orientations of the compass, and the garden, dedicated to the arts and but free of monumentalising gesture, conformed to ideal city plans from utopian literature. Le Play borrowed from Tommaso Campanella's early sevente enth-century The City of the Sun , which proffered a model in which a perfected society was combined with a visual form of 82 Sigfried Giedion, Space, Time and Architecture: The Growth of a New Tradition (Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press, 1956, third edition) , 259. Giedion noted that chief constructor 's assistant was Gustav Eiffel: \"it was from him that the real inspiration for the Galerie des Machines came.\" 152 education.83 Histories and cultures were accommodated in a living environment - writ large in a prefabricated architecture at the scale of the city - for acquiring universal knowledge. Considered a century later, the thematic was critical. In 1867, a pacific equilibrium between peoples was to be actualised in acts of circumnavigati ng the globe reproduced as large-scale architecture . Wh ether in 1867 or 1967, the resulting re -enchantment of the world , the new \"divine spirit\" of technology, followed themes of discovery, of exploration . This sense of modernity, as an endless vista of new encounter and experience, remained resonant. Findi ng its appropriate cultural expression quickly informed architectural approaches to the Expo 67 islands. The van Ginkels had consistently upheld the Arctic as precisely the kind of concern capable of registering scientific and cultural endeavours of different nations, thus establishing an ecumenical parsing of Terre des Hommes and manifesting the preferred meta -theme of Man the Explorer. The idea served as the basis of a design. Over the summer of 1963, as they relinquished hopes on Man in the City, the van Ginkels' young staff architects, mainly Naud\u00e9 and Miller, advanced the very first architecture, necessarily diagrammatic, of Expo 67: The Project on \"Man and the Polar Regions\" is particularly suited to multinational treatment, since there already exists among nations involved in polar research a tradition of successful co- operation. All these counties, large and small, will be invited to contribute exhibits dealing with the subjects in which they have an interest. 84 83 Pieter van Wesemael, Architecture of Instruction and Delight: A Socio -historical Analysis of World Exhibitions as a Didactic Phenomenon (1798 -1851- 1970) (Rotterdam: Uitgeverij 010, 200), 241. 84 Man and the Polar Regions (no date): n.p., Canadian Corporation for the World Exhibition Fonds, RG71 , Library and Archives Canada, Ottawa; Ad\u00e8le Naud\u00e9 Santos, interview with author (October 17, 2008), Montreal. 153 Noting that \"Man and the Oceans\" an d \"Man in Space\" were being similarly considered, and drawing on the Montebello idea of \"Theme Areas\", the architects envisioned a \"thematic approach\" to the design: nations were rendered as individual silos, each exhibiting \"vertical coherence\", but tied together by interweaving pathways - \"the threads of the story\" - giving the greater complex \"a horizontal coherence\" (fig. 3.8). These \"storylines\" were not simply devices for organising displays; rather, they would be made \"visible\" as mechanised circula tion systems allowing visitors \"to enter and leave each project at different levels and in many directions\"; consequently, \"One should be able to pick up the thread of the story at any point and to leave it any point without loss of coherence.\" 85 (The imme rsive experience recalled The Family of Man , where visitors followed multiple paths through the exhibition from \"birth\" to \"death\"; designed by Paul Rudolph, the origins lay in the German \u00e9migr\u00e9 and former Bauhaus Meister Herbert Bayer's concept of \"extend ed vision\" produced by a three -dimensional hanging technique.86) Strategies of \"discontinuous\" movement - thus of open -ended histories - were purposefully to upend nation -state hierarchies: countries could exhibit on some or all levels of any project; others would simply attach to certain theme zones, expanding to accommodate special exhibits or moving further afield, but remaining connected, if having \"a tenuous relationship to the project\"; those not wishing to participate 85 Ibid. 86Fred Turner, \"The Family of Man and the Politics of Attention in Cold War America\", Public Culture 24:1 (2012): 65ff; Olivier Lugon, \"Dynamic Paths of Thought: Exhibition Design, Photography and Circulation in the Work of Herbert Bayer\", in Francois Albera and Maria Tortajada, eds., Cinema Beyond Film: Media Epistemology in the Modern Era (Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press, 2010) , 117-144. 154 in certain areas were , polemically, to leave a void in the plan. An emblematic sector showed a cavernous \"Ice City\", set slightly below grade, and a roof garden sandwiching exhibition levels linked by ramps and moving sidewalks and intersected by a continuous \"thread\" leading beyond to the next areas. As Michel Chevalier, the van Ginkels' friend and patron now serving as consultant on the Expo 67 theme, put it: The method which has been chosen combines factors of flexibility, an evolving process related to design and exhibitor requirem ents and estimated resources, elements representing a complete picture of Terre des Homes.... A territorial (also in its context of environmental) basis has been used. Where in the past national boundaries were the main consideration of exhibit entities, the present formula accepts national boundaries when desired by the exhibitor, but offers territorial (or environmental) choices for alternative or additional participation by a country (or by a domestic Canadian exhibitor). 87 Like Le Play's ideal diagram, Man and the Polar Regions gave a radical sense of experiencing trans -historical \"organic\" laws: \"Transportation could be traced from sledge and kayak, through the ships of Vikings and later explorers, up to the nuclear submarine\", the tool par excellence of Cold War polarisation of the North; \"The shelter sequence would begin with non-permanent shelters - the igloo and the yurt - used by nomadic peoples... and the modern housing now being used in Northern industrial centres\", a recognition perhaps of Team 10 member Erskine's Ecological Arctic Town (1958) but especially of Canadian efforts to create a veritable megastructural city in Frobisher Bay on Baffin Island, which followed the Conservative government's popular platform of \"road to resources\" and 87 Michel Chevalier, \"Method of Creating Exhibit Subjects Based on the Theme 'Terre des Hommes'\" (September Fonds Gilles Gagnon, Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal. 155 northern development following the 1957 federal election (fig. 3.9).88 In this expansive taxonomy, the link between igloo and yurt (a decidedly non -Nordic form of shelter) suggested relating notions on the Arctic to other synchronic expressions of world cultures. Moreover, like Le Play's \"globe of iron\", the spatial didactics were modelled not only on cartography but on urbanity: positing a city, the designers would draw on new theories of \"movement\", advanced by Team 10 and others, offering an experiential appro ach to urbanism - a technological fix immediately visible in the architects' search for moving sidewalk systems. 89 Yet unlike Le Play's \"globe of iron\" (or the other nineteenth -century behemoths once recalled by the van Ginkels), here was a far more decent ralised network without necessarily strict hierarchies of classification. The idea reflected Daniel van Ginkel's dismissal, shared by his young staff architects , of the CIAM \"single function\" building and resonated with megastructural notions on \"plug -in\" solutions. 90 Chevalier's mention of flexibility knowingly corresponded to diverse approaches united in redeeming functionalism from determinist excess by introducing concepts of time and the unknown.91 The political corollary was clear in the challenge to the nation -state and the control of territory. Thus, the master plan. Like Thomas More's Utopia, the islands of Expo 67 were, in a sense, nowhere and everywhere at the same time, cut from the existing world by a trench 88 Man and the Polar Regions , n.p. 89 \"Canadian World Exhibition 1967, Comparative Difference in Cost of 3 Site Proposals\" (May 1963): n.p. , Series 27 -A21-03, Fonds van Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal. 90 Van Ginkel, \"Credo\", 45. 91 Adrian Forty, Words and Buildings: A Vocabulary of Modern Architecture (London: Thames & Hudson, 2000), 142. 156 separating the old from the new, the past from the future, the historically grounded from the imagined ideal. Just as his crescent -shaped no -place allowed More to comment on society circa 1516, \u00cele Notre Dame and \u00cele Sainte-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne provided the architects an opportunity to confront prevail ing norms of postwar urbanism. The CCWE officials had convened Montebello precisely in this spirit: facing the inevitability of the islands, they sought the most polemical ideas on realising what was, in effect, to be a world city, however temporary. The hope was openly expressed at a post -Montebello meeting of the CCWE administrators: Monsieur Pich \u00e9 declared that it has become necessary to break the typical schema of universal expositions by inviting more nations to decentralise their national attributes and in soliciting their participation within large pavilions dedicated the Expo theme. Monsieur Jean Drapeau declared his agreement but said that from a practical point of view there will be huge obstacles to overcome. Monsieur Pich \u00e9 added that it is crucial to subordinate the concept of nations to that of peoples . 92 Despite Drapeau's predictable hedging, Lucien Pich\u00e9, vice-rector of the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, who had presided over the Montebello summit on behalf of the CCWE, stood steadfast in the ambition \"to break\" any form of national supremacy; decentralisation and subordination were not only statements on political power but descriptions on the architectural translation - as plan - of the exhibition theme. However diagrammatically, Man and the Pol ar Regions made this an ultimate statement. The storylines -cum-movement systems were to create urban infrastructure giving an experiential sense - literally moving - of forever resituating Terre des Hommes . The principle followed closely ideas raised at the recent Team 10 meeting held at the Abbaye Royaumont, north of Paris, in September 1962 92 \"Proc\u00e8s -verbal de la Dixi\u00e8me Assembl\u00e9e l 'Exposition Universelle Canadienne \" (7 June 1963): 3, translation by author, Canadian Corporation for the World Exhibition Fonds, RG71, Library and Archives Canada, Ottawa. 157 (just as Man in the City was finalised). Its invitation, which the van Ginkels surely received, stated the \"Theme of Meeting\": Focus on reciprocal urban infra -struc ture/building group concepts. That a communication system, offers both 'structure' and 'building organisation potential' is clear: what is less clear is how to sustain this building organisation potential in the actual building groups, in the 'infill' of the infra -structure. There seem to be two modes of operation offered: - An extension of the infra -structure idea into the building group, so that a system with growth potential is put forward and the ultimate form is not fully anticipated (the stem idea in its ideal sense) - The 'group form' idea, in which all the components are directed towards the final preconceived form (The Japanese approach). It being accepted that the general objective of both modes is towards the usefulness and comprehensibility of the group. 93 A handful of \"building- group concepts\" were noted for discussion, including Tange's Tokyo \"group form\" concept, and Candilis schemes of Toulouse-Le Mirail and Caen -H\u00e9rouville. The latter was crucial to the Expo 67 plans. Ad\u00e8le Naud\u00e9 had, in fact, attended the important Abbaye Royaumont meeting (fig. 3.10). At the time, she was working closely with Shadrach Woods on the unrealised University of Bochum competition that conceived a continuous and public promenade - \"stem\" - with branch-like extensions to which buildings would link (fig. 3.11). Increasingly central to Team 10 debate, Woods had posited \"stem\" as \"linear organisation \" extending \"all the prolongements du logis: commercial, cultural, educational, and leisure 93 Invitation to the Team 10 meeting at Abbaye Royaumont, quoted in Alison Smithson, ed., Team 10 Meetings (New York: Rizzoli, 1991): 27. 158 activities, as well a s roads, footpaths and services \".94 This \"basic structure\" could adapt to a landscape and be phased over time. Patterns of movement would mark urban experience. Having extended \"stem\" to Man and the Polar Regions, Naud\u00e9 now redistributed the pavilion as components of a master plan on \u00cele Notre -Dame. In drawings developed in late summer 1963, the principle of Man and the Polar Regions was transformed into a large horizontal network (fig. 3.12). A tartan grid of exhibition \"precincts\" spread evenly across the two islands and onto the mainland; \"moving belts\" and and \"grouped pavilions\" shown as magnified versions of a typical sector in Man and the Polar Regions. (The effect was not unlike the new \"web\" sol utions being proposed by Woods and epitomised by the \"groundscraper\" form of the Berlin Free University competition project of 1963. 95) The evenly dispersed but interlinked precincts were to house a Terre des Hommes now refined as \"six environmental exhibit subjects\": The Polar Regions, The Tropics, The Oceans, Space, The City, and \"Others\" (which \"cannot in itself be an entity\" but would somehow present the output of nations from the \"mid -latitudes\").96 The islands sites would be connected by a \"'Terre des Hommes' bridge: - expressing the significance of the theme in a general sense, and acting as 94 Shadrach Woods, \"Urban Environment: The Search for System\", in J. Donat, ed., World Architecture 1 (London: Studio Vista, 1964): 153; Shadrach Woods, \"Stem\", Architectural Design (May 1960): 181. 95 Berlin Free University was completed in 1973, with only part of the original scheme finally realised. 96 Michel Chevalier, \"Theme Development, Position Papers No. 9\" (August 12, 1963): 1, and \"Thematic Development, Position Papers No. 10\" (August 26, 1963): 1, Series 27- A21-04, Fonds van Ginkel, Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal. 159 an introduction to the sub divisions of the theme shown in the precinc ts\".97 Originally titled the \"Realto bridge\", the misspelling of the Rialto Bridge in Venice likely meant the Ponte Vecchio in Florence, with its inhabited structure and the Vasari Corridor being upheld in megastructural discourse as ur -model of multifunctional buildings. The form - a massive podium housing an array of pavilions connected by raised pedestrian pathways and hemmed by a double transport spine - was again a nod to Tange's Tokyo Bay proposal (fig. 3.13). Throughout, Naud\u00e9's plan attempted to c onvey a sense of nomadic flow facilitated by mechanised movement. The social realm of the world's fair was to be in ceaseless states of change as visitors continuously renegotiated the terms - the \"storylines\" - by which the artefacts and ideas comprising the totality of Terre Des Hommes were displayed. Naud\u00e9's studies indicated a new urban paradigm for the world exhibition. The implication of \"movement\" was immediately to change the urban morphology: \"an elongated site as compared to previous centrali zed exhibits.\" 98 The suggestion came from Moshe Safdie, who, upon graduating from McGill University in 1961, had worked for the van Ginkels on the Meadowvale new town and was, by early September 1963, among their young Expo 67 staff architects. Safdie had contributed some of the more heroic elaborations of Meadowvale in massive pyramidal housing, commercial, and industrial sectors set along a 97 Affleck, Desbarats, Dimakopoulos, Lebensold, Sise, \"Preliminary Report on Study\" (July 17, 1963): 1, and \"Preliminary Design Program - World's Fair\" (April 1963): 1- 2, Series D03.9 -109-26-TD, Fonds Guy Desbarats, Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal. By August 1963, it was labelled \"Pont des peuples\". 98 M. Safdie, \"Internal Transportation System - 39- 1990- 07-002, Fonds Gagnon, for Architecture, Montreal. 160 transportation system: each \"productive unit depends on others just as they depend on it\" ; \"Rapid transit unites th e centre city\"; the \"key point is TRANSPORTATION\".99 Still early in his career, Safdie - who had, under Daniel van Ginkel, designed a modular housing system as his McGill thesis project that would become the basis of Habitat 67 - saw the future city in ter ms of regional planning. His Meadowvale scheme, which brooked little distinction between town and country, recalled the linear city originating in the Spanish planner Arturo Soria y Mata's ciudad lineal of 1882, with its sections of infrastructure - water , gas, electricity, and sewage - extending an optimal line to which components of the city would simply attach. The example persisted in modern planning theory, notably Nikolay Milyutin's Sotsgorod of 1930, a scheme for \"d e-urbanisation\" in a continuous r ibbon of decentralised industry , and Le Corbusier's Ville Radieuse as well as his viaduct cities (van Ginkel's inspiration for \"an architecture of movement\") also projected around 1930 as theoretically limitless urban forms.100 The principle was of ever -increasing speed : whether by railway or automobile, the mechanised acceleration of human life was to make possible the infinite geographical reach of the modern city - a possibility heroically evoked by Soria y Mata: \"A single street of some 500 metres width and of the length that may be necessary... 99 Moshe Safdie, Sketchbook R, 26-27, Moshe Safdie Archive, Canadian , Montreal. 100 N.A. Miliutin , Sotsgorod: The Problem of Building Socialist Cities (1930; Cambridge MA: The MIT Press, 1974) . Le Corbusier's linear city ideas culminated in Les trois etablissements humains (1944) , which outlined ways to urbanise both town and country. 161 [a city] whose extremities could be Cadiz or St Petersburg or Peking or Brussels\".101 Safdie quickly began envisioning an exhibition -cum -world city in similar terms. Following a stint under the van Ginkels, Safdie w orked for Louis Kahn in Philadelphia, where he witnessed the final phases of the Philadelphia Centre City plans and spent time moonlighting on competitions. Participating in the important 1963 Manchia plan competition for a new city centre in Tel Aviv, Sa fdie, an Israeli by origin, looked beyond the city limits and imagined a transportation system moving at 300 miles per hour reducing the country to \"a single urban region\"; the project conceived \"a highly accessible point\" - announced by soaring helical st ructures openly recalling the Japanese Metabolist Kishi Kurokawa's Helix City project of 1961 - \"on an urban transportation spine running from the northern cities to the port of Elat\" (fig. 3.14). 102 Safdie had proposed a similar idea one year earlier in a competition project for resettling Arab refugees in Giza, Egypt, where enormous quasi -pyramidal forms of housing, commerce, and industry - recalling the Meadowvale scheme - were to be linked throughout by a transportation system leading far beyond the city (fig. 3.15): The continuous -motion transit principle is here applied at the scale of an urban sector. Systems of movement replacing conventional subways, buses, elevators, and sidewalks are integrated into a single hierarchical network of mass transit mo ving at accelerating and decelerating speeds ranging from 60 miles per hour to 2 miles per hour. Starting on a journey, one would embark on a moving sidewalk or vertical elevator that, rather than stop, would accelerate at certain intervals to greater spe eds where one makes a transfer in motion to the second and faster system. It traveling a 101 Arturo Soria y Mata quoted in Kenneth Frampton, Modern Architecture: A Critical History (London: Thames and Hudson, 1992), 27- 28. 102 Moshe Safdie, For Everyone a Garden (Cambridge MA: The MIT Press, 1974), 14. 162 greater distance, one would then make another transfer when that system accelerates to meet the prime urban transit system, which again never comes to a stop, but rather accelerates and decelerates. In this way complete mobility is achieved without ever having to walk more than a thousand feet and without ever having to resort to personal vehicles, yet without ever having to wait for the public transit system. 103 The world of perpetual mechanised movement evoked precisely the evolution of the Expo 67 site plan, which drew on combining metabolic senses of strolling through the city with anticipations of speeding through it. Thus did Safdie and Jerry Miller, one of the t hree young Harvard urban design graduates working under van Ginkel on the master plan, advance a \"Continuous Motion Transportation System\" as means to organise the exhibition: It is proposed that a system of non -stop continuous motion means of mechanical transportation be developed. Such a system will consist of two to three hierarchical systems which accelerate and decelerate - never coming to a stop. Loading and unloading of passengers occurs when two systems run side by side at identical speeds hence are stationary relative to each other. 104 Trains reaching from the city centre to the islands at 15 to 30 miles per hour, \"carts\" (or \"horizontal elevators\") running at 5 to 15 miles per hour, and moving sidewalks travelling at 2 to 5 miles per hour composed the synchronised system (fig. 3.16). 105 Transportation - \"prime factor to the organization of man's environment\" - was, therefore, to become an 103 Ibid., 10 -11. Safdie envisioned the Arab refugee city resulting from compensation funds allowing the establishment of several industries, including building, with refugees given training in mass production techniques to build their own city. Safdie saw it as a personal model: \"quite apart from the political ideas behind it, the refugee city became a kind of vehicle for constantly developing and expressing my image of the utopian city.\" See: Safdie, Beyond Habitat (Cambridge MA: The MIT Press, 1970), 61. 104 M.

There is no apparent limit to this potential of extremely large cores, which embody the technological, cultural, and the social achievements of man. If the core can be ma de accessible to even large numbers with convenience and comfort it is conceivable than [sic] a more sophisticated and advanced organization can be allowed to develop with all of the advantages that this implies. Essential to this organization are the multiplicity of linkages that occur between people, goods, and establishments. 107 Unlike postwar CIAM debate demanding the \"core\" as a concentration of activities, a new hypothesis on \"coreway\" - leading to a \"regional structure of cities\" - was to be experien ced in \"an integrated system of continuous flow transit\" transcending the world's fair and challenging the city: \"The existing radial growth of metropolitan regions is immediately replaced by a linear (more manageable) pattern relating to the transit system and its pulsation.\" 108 In the biomechanical analogy, Safdie offered a model: the experimental engineer Robert Le Ricolais's pioneering work on dynamic structures in applying topological deformation to the design of space frames - a vision manifested in th e Skyrail , a multilevel elevated transport system with train cars carried inside soaring \"Tension -Net\" bridges (made of funicular cables rotated about circular diaphragms) meeting at massive piers containing 106 M.

In 1958, Team 10 member Jaap Bakema had proposed a concept of \"core wall\" as a large - scale device closely tied to elevated motorways carrying high -speed vehicular movement either into or across existing cities; see: Kenneth Frampton, \"Team 10 and the Challenge of the Megalopolis: Between Counterform and Infrastructure 1952 -73\", in Dirk van den Heuval and Max Risselada, eds., Team 10 1953 -81: In Search of a Utopia of the Present (Rotterdam: NAi Publishers, 2005) , 291 -292. 164 stations and tow ering over the landscape (fig. 3 .17).109 Writing to Le Ricolais in September 1963, Safdie reminded the engineer, then teaching in the Institute for Architectural Research at the University of Pennsylvania, of their meeting several months earlier in Louis Kahn's office and described the wo rld's fair transportation system studies. Wondering if Le Ricolais's \"continuous motion system... could be of assistance to us, either for reference or even the possible application to this specific problem\", Safdie asked for advice.110 Le Ricolais had, in f act, conceived his system in terms not unlike those sought by van Ginkel's staff architects: The technical problems, though considerable, are negligible by comparison with those of financing such a project and that of land acquisition. The survival of our cities is, however, dependent on the successful solution of the ever increasing problem of traffic congestion. 111 In Montreal, f inancing and land were, indeed, presumed readily available given government debt expenditures for the future world's fair. Yet when replying to Safdie, Le Ricolais, while admitting \"an extreme pleasure in reading your proposal\" and \"the boldness of the scheme\", switched the terms of reference. Acknowledging that the \"Reclamation site\" and its \"future use\" would be perfectly suited to his project, he eschewed thinking about the urban dimension; hinting at a nervousness on the lack of programme, thus the unknown 109 Larry Busbea, Topologies: The Urban Utop ia in France, 1960 -1970 (Cambridge MA: The MIT 2007), Architecture: Formes et Fonctions -87.

There may have been bases of comparison to 1960s megastructural discourse, but Le Ricolais appeared to demur from any association - especially with similar expressions on \"spatial urbanism\" then being evinced in the architecture mobile of Yona Friedman and others (fig. 3.18).113 He later declared: I know a guy in Paris who can make fantastic dreams come true : taking the world for some kind of garden, you draw a whole future city in the sky; you reduce all the complex function of a city into a ready -made form. It may have some scenic value, but the danger of such an exhibit lies probably in its seductive power, the fascination with image for its own sake, based on some uncritical attitude or a desire for publicity. 114 112 R.

Busbea notes that Le Ricolais was a distant correspondent to the French art and architecture critic Michel Ragon's Groupe International d'Architecture Prospective (GIAP), whose founding manifest o Friedman had signed. Friedman would otherwise preoccupy himself with Groupe d'Etudes d'Architecture Mobile (GEAM) until its dissolution in 1962. 114 Robert Le Ricolais, \"'Things Themselves are Lying, and so are Their Images'\", in VIA 2 (University of Pennsylvania, 1973): 86. 166 It remained whether these technologies were meant as an \"exhibit\", in the traditions of world's fairs, or really as the technics of utopian citie s.115 Safdie's appeal to Le Ricolais indicated just how much the master plan remained in the realm of prognostication. There was, in all this, an almost desperate, maybe cynical, rejection of the city. Unlike previous world's fairs offering cities in miniature, the new paradigm provided a version of a megalopolis in miniature. 116 Discourses first animating the plans - the trope of \"human scale\" introduced in postwar CIAM discourse - were now confronted by a city displaced far beyond its borders. Eschewing t he limits of architecture qua architecture for the technologies of movement , the architects appeared untroubled by parallel processes of decentralisation, with transportation routes leading to new suburbs and leaving the city to the fates of urban renewal. The ambition somehow to find in the world's fair a way of returning to the existing, albeit improved, city seemed increasingly fraught. IMAGES The \"elongated\" exhibition plan, created and united by mechanised movement, brought another critical intellect ual project to bear on the plan. Urban renewal had been central to 115 Exactly one year after Louis Kahn, Le Ricolais would speak at the PQAA meeting in January 1964 and introduce his Skyrail concept in a paper titled \"Expo et Cit\u00e9; une liaison a\u00e9rienne\". While creating a stir among the attendees, th ere was little impact on the world's fair plans. See: Robert Le Ricolais, \"An Aerial Mass Transit System\", Journal of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada (April 1964): 59- 62. 116 The French geographer Jean Gottmann's book Megalopolis: The Urbanized Northeastern Seaboard of the United States (1961) had explored the heavily urbanised area stretching from Boston to Washington D.C. Safdie and Miller similarly described a massive \"urban entity\" epitomised by \"the Ontario; see: Safdie and Miller, \"Proposal for a Continuous Motion Transportation System\", 5. 167 the new Harvard postgraduate degree in urban design that Naud\u00e9 and Miller had pursued. Joining them on Van Ginkel's CCWE staff was Steven Staples, who would continue elaborating the trans portation systems and was among the last graduates of the Harvard city planning course (which Lemco van Ginkel had completed in 1949) before it was remade as urban design under Josep Llu\u00eds Sert in 1960. Sert's postwar CIAM arguments on the \"core\" presaged North American policies advocating civic centres - imagined in Giedion's \"New Monumentality\" - for renewing blighted areas. (An inescapable fixation on \"Man in the City\" -like projects found Frank Vigier, an adjunct professor at Harvard, assisting Daniel van Ginkel on desperately convincing the CCWE to reject the island in favour of a project of urban renewal. 117) Sert's work, especially campus design, provided the backdrop for Harvard's pioneering programme, which also grew out of the influential Urban Des ign Conferences first convened in April 1956.118 Studios undertook projects of both decentralisation (continuing approaches by Martin Wagner, under whom Lemco van Ginkel had studied) and civic renewal. Yet in terms of urbanism as preoccupation in the 1960s , perhaps the most critical links - and divisions - between city planning and urban design emerged in an accompanying seminar. Giedion and Sert had introduced the phrase \"urban 117 Francois C. Vigier, \"General Memorandum No. One\" (21 June 1963), 1- 8, Series 27 -A21-11, Fonds van Ginkel, Canadian Ce ntre for Architecture, Montreal .

The Harvard urban design studio often selected sites officially slated for renewal schemes in cities comprising the \"megalopolis\" stretching from Boston to Baltimore . 168 design\" at Harvard in 1954.119 In a subsequent seminar on \"The Human Scale\", wh ich grew from concerns on \"humanization of urban life\", a theme of CIAM 8 that produced \"The Heart of the City\", Giedion included studies on proportion (including Le Corbusier's Modular) as lessons on \"how to place volumes in space\"; a 1957 version was tied to a studio on \"The Residential Sector\" that, with Lemco van Ginkel as a visiting instructor, proposed mid-rise housing and community facilities as alternatives to suburbia and high -rise public housing (fig. 3.19). 120 In each instance, new techniques of v isualisation - new aesthetic means of reading and organising space - were tied to the creation of civic form. Yet the clear senses of order - the residual functionalism - of such schemes were not necessarily reconciled with new discourses on urbanism . Indeed, a growing interest in the disorder of cities would inform the \"new\" discipline if urban design. The theory was captured in the planner Kevin Lynch's influential book The Image of the City of 1960. As member of the Harvard -MIT Joint Center for Urban Studies, Lynch had undertaken studies on the \"Perceptual Form of the City\" with his colleague Gyorgy Kepes. Kepes, an \u00e9migr\u00e9 Hungarian painter based at MIT, had, since the 1940s, been situating design as \"the sensory qualities of the visual field and the organizing of them\" with \"the shaping of sensory 119 Sert appears to have used the term \"urban design\" first in public during a 1953 lecture delivered at the Regional Con ference of the AIA -Middle Atlantic District held in Washington, D.C. and devoted to the theme \"The Architect and Urban Design and Urban Redevelopment \"; on this, see: Eric Mumford, \"The Emergence of Urban Design in the Breakup of CIAM\" , in Alex Krieger and William S. Saunders, eds., Urban Design (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2009 ), 17. 120 Mumford, Defining Urban Design: CIAM Architects and the Formation of a Discipline, 1937 -69, 114, 134, 135-136, 147- 148. As Mumford notes, Giedion's interests in urban design began waning by the end of the decade; a 1959 seminar would see his interests shift to early cities and the ways in which art and architecture developed in them. 169 impressions into unified, organic wholes\" - an ambition informing his book The New Landscape in Art and Science of 1956. In it, Kepes ceaselessly juxtaposed a stunning collection of images, comparing natural forms to modern artworks, from magnified crystals to geodesic domes, as arguments on ways to navigate the modern city : \"Leading us away from the system of fixed things, and toward the system of spatio -temporal patterns, the newly revealed visible world brings us to the threshold of a new vision\" (fig. 3.20).121 The discovery of patterns - existing in any number of stimuli including buildings, and perceived by forms of movement (also made visible by the instruments of mass media) - was to create visual, psychological, and social harmony in the built environment. 122 The argument rested on studying human perception - to Kepes, \"pattern -seeing\" - as the key to order in the world of artefacts. Through patterns, information began to create visual effects. Recog nising, even troubled by, apparently unremitting accelerations of everyday life - highways, television, urban renewal - and a concomitant sensory overload, Lynch and Kepes's analyses, dovetailing with postwar interests in the psychology of perception, woul d not focus on cities per se but on the perceptual apparatus through which people recognised the urban realm; or, as Kepes had early argued, the \"dynamic basis of human beings is to 121 Gyorgy Kepes, The Language of Vision (1944; Chicago: Paul Theobald and Company, 1967), 15; Kepes, The New Landscape in Art and Science (Chicago: Paul Theobald and Company, 1956), 206. Kepes's mention of \"a new vision\" was to recall his friend Laszlo Moholy-Nagy's The New Vision , first published as one of the Bauhausb\u00fccher in 19 28 and reissued as a revised English edition in 1947. The books collected both men's pedagogical approaches at the Chicago Institute of Design in the early 1940s. 122 Reinhold Martin, The Organizational Complex: Architecture, Media, and Corporate Space (Cambridge MA: The MIT Press, 2003) , 43, 45. 170 form whatever situation they face into an integrated whole\".123 The almost apocalyptic tone, delivered not long after the Second World War, intimated a bas is - a new visual language - for surviving in the modern world. Lynch synthesised their ideas - while eschewing Kepes's striking photographs - in The Image of the City . The bo ok offered, as its title suggested, a theory on \" imageability \", codifying individuals' perceptions of urban environments to demonstrate that they used specific features (paths, edges, nodes, landmarks, and districts) to \"read\" their cities. The proposed experiential approach to urbanism, while providing coherent designs, would not impose total solutions inhibiting future patterns of activity: \"A city must have both an obvious structure that can be grasped immediately and also a potential structure which will allow one gradually to construct a more complex and comprehensive picture.\" 124 Marked by Kepes's admitted influence of Gestalt psychology, the argument also absorbed the impact of cognitive sciences then shaping many disciplines at MIT, notably cybernetics, the \"new science\" of regulatory systems that one of its key founders, Norbert Wiener, had already proposed as way to understand the social realm: \"society can only be understood through a study of the messages and communication facilities which belong to it\". 125 The psycho - aesthetic \"feedback\" between perception and design rested, according to Lynch, on recognising 123 Forty, Words and Buildings: A Vocabulary of , 241; Defining Urban Design: CIAM Architects and the Formation of a Discipline , 25. 124 Kevin Lynch, The Image of the City (Cambridge MA: The MIT Press, 1960), 158. 125 Norbert Wiener, The Human Use of Human Beings: Cybernetics and Society ( 1950; New York: Avon Books, 1967), 21, 25. 171 that although \"the city itself is five hundred years old, the metropolis is a new phenomenon, dating from a mere hundred years ago\".126 The pe riodisation allowed claiming a modern aesthetics for a modern environment, and vice versa . The \"new vision\" still aspired to Giedion's phenomena of \"interpenetration\" described in Space, Time and Architecture : \"In order to grasp the true nature of space t he observer must project himself through it\".127 If this was also an argument on mechanised movement, then it faced Lynch's eclipse of city by metropolis , where \"a vast organism whose scale far transcends individual control\" now arose.128 Lynch thus recognis ed the power of the automobile not only for navigating these enormous distances (possibly wastelands following urban renewal) but as giving a new \"view from the road\" on reimaging city space (literally, the \"esthetics of highways\"). 129 Such ideas had, in fa ct, informed Man in the City. Editing a 1961 special issue of Canadian Art on \"the Automobile\", Lemco van Ginkel argued, Moving at high speed in the automobile has created new visual images of place in time. The larger landscape which is explored tediou sly on foot, unfolds rapidly at higher speeds.... We see in a different way when we move rapidly - many images are received at high frequency and superimposed in the mind's eye to form a composite image. This everyday excursion into the world of space-time - the realization of the true dimensions and relationships in our visual environment - 126 Kevin Lynch and Lloyd Rodwin, \"A World of Cities\", Daedalus vol. 90, No. 1 (Winter 1961), 4.

Myer, The View from the Road (Cambridge MA: The MIT Press, 1964). 172 brings us closer to the world of the artist and to his quest for the realities of imagery.130 The claim was for \"s peed\" : as a \"tool\" it \"increases our visual capacity\" to \"stimulate the creation of new forms of aesthetic merit\". Lemco van Ginkel would, in suitably Giedion -like terms, later find \"a new form for the centre city which is spatially akin to the sculpture of Max Bill or Jean Arp, the mobiles of Alexander Calder, the engineering Robert Maillart or Robert Le Ricolais, the landscape of Noguchi - and commensurate with the spirit of man who still is a biped but not necessarily 'pedestrian'\" . 131 The se very artists and engineers, save Noguchi, had appeared in Kepes's The New Landscape , mentioned or illustrated in a section on \"Symmetry, Proportion, Module\" (fig. 3.21). Describing processes of \"feedback\" central to self -regulating systems, as inherited from cybernetics but also biological sciences, Kepes noted how certa in artists and architects - \"those willing to face industrial civilization and accept its premises\" - had unconsciously adopted \"modular logic\" well before developing \"a plastic technique\". 132 Bill's sculptures appeared among Georges Seurat's pointillist views of the Eiffel Tower, Francesco di Giorgio's study of human and architectural proportion, or 130 Blanche Lemco van Ginkel, \"Editorial\", Canadian Art (January -February 1962): 19. Edited by Lemco van Ginkel, the special issue consider ed \"Design of the Automobile \", \"Design by the Automobile \", and \"Design for the Automobile\" . While theories on \"movement\" were part of Team 10 discourse, for Lemco van Ginkel this also followed also a sustained immersion in practices of North America urban ism. A year before beginning the Expo 67 plans, she had participated in the Fifth H arvard Urban Design Conference that took as its theme \"The Institution as a Generator of Urban Form\" . Offering a critique of the Detroit Civic Complex originally conceived by Eero Saarinen, Lemco van Ginkel emphasised the need for \"pedestrian links and visual scale\" and evoked new perceptual qualities associated with mechanical movement systems. See: Harvard Graduate School of Design, The Institution as a Generator of Urba n Form, Fifth Urban Design Conference, April 1961 (Cambridge MA: Harvard GSD Alumni Association, 1961). 131 Blanche Lemco van Ginkel, \"The City Centre Pedestrian\", Architecture Canada (August 1966): 39. 132 Kepes, The New Landscape in Art and Science , 346. 173 Eduardo Catalano's studies on hyperbolic paraboloids; a Calder mobile rested opposite an aerial view of a new interstate cloverleaf; Le Ricolais's experimental space frames were juxtaposed to standardised chair parts by Charles and Ray Eames and the magnetic core of an MIT computer. Throughout, the portfolio elevated aesthetic, biological, and technological entities as ways to imagine organising more perfected i nstances of the built world. There was an architectural consequence for the world's fair. In Lemco van Ginkel's aesthetics of \"speed\", following Lynch, pace Kepes, architecture may well have become one among many interchangeable mediums, all exhibiting organisational patterns, of design.133 Despite its search for order, the effect of Kepes's compilation of scientific and artistic works was akin to what Marshall McLuhan had described as the \"whirling phantasmagoria\" of what \"stems from the laboratory, the studio, and the advertising agencies\" - all of it, as the subtitle of his 1951 book The Mechanical Bride stated, \"the folklore of industrial man\". 134 In terms not unlike those of Kepes or McLuhan, the van Ginkels had, when first advancing Man and His World (in lieu of Man in the City), warned of \"aesthetic weakness\" in an \"exhibition which was difficult to comprehend as a totality and induced extreme fatigue on the part of the visitors.\" 135 Indeed, a sense of exhaustion permeat ed Kepes's visual narrative. At the 133 Martin, The Organizational Complex: Architecture, Media, and Corporate Space, 75. 134 Herbert Marshall McLuhan, The Mechanical Bride: Folklore of Industrial Man (1951; Berkeley CA: Ginko Press, 2001), v.

Michel Series 27 -A21-13, Fonds van Ginkel, Canadian Centre for Architecture, 174 same time, a utopian hope lay in the willful integration of art and science that offered new ways of imaging - of conquering fatigue by discovering patterns - when traversing the urban realm (or navigating the onslaught of information emanating in the postwar world). Here, the new landscape began to reveal architecture. The blurred, hovering, kinetic expressions seen by Lemco van Ginkel as animating new kinds of urbanism - aesthetics shared by the young architects designing Expo 67 - culminated in Ke pes's catalogue of modules , proportions , and symmetries with a series of long -span structures - thin shell vaults, hyperbolic paraboloids, Buckminster Fuller's tensegrity structure (cleverly contrasted to a polystryola microorganism), and, crucially, one of the visionary architect Konrad Wachsmann's utterly remarkable space structures studies (fig. 3.22). Shown as a vanishing perspective taken deep inside the structure, the project repeated sections of a single twisted three -legged unit into a seemingly in finite lattice. In a quick succession of terms - flexibility, standardization , crystalline, space -packing , interconnection, a maximum of stability and strength\" redolent of space frames, which he believed ascendant in architectural culture. 136 Already suggested in Montreal . Lemco van Ginkel may well have discovered McLuhan's work, notwithstanding its popularity, from Jacqueline Tyrwhitt, a key interlocutor when teaching city planning at the University of Pennsylvania in the 1950s. (Tyrwhitt encouraged Lemco van Ginkel to help establish GAI, the Philadelphia chapter of CIAM.) Tyrwhitt was Giedion's principal collaborator in CIAM and facilitated his exchanges with McLuhan, with whom she had worked on media studies as part of the Explorations group at the University of Toronto in the 1950s ; see: Michael Darroch, \" Bridging Urban and Media Studies: Jaqueline Tyrwhitt and the Explorations Group, 1951- 1957\", of Communication, Vol. 33 (2008): 147-169. 136 Kepes, The New Landscape in Art and Science , 352. Kepes's project, partly culminating in descriptions of architectural technics, hewed closely to a deeply modern - that is, late -nineteenth century and twentieth century - project of dovetailing technol ogy and applied science , especially in a postwar world marked by \"research and design\", the transformation of universities by large- scale government projects (especially MIT, where Kepes taught), and warnings of a \"military -industrial complex\". Kepes was also in the midst of fashioning a 175 Giedion's \"New Monumentailty\", space frames emerged in the 1950s as an almost alternative trajectory to postwar modernism, offering, theoretically at least, heroic structur es capable of housing a mass public. Indeed, Wachsmann had, in his book The Turning Point of Building of 1961, purposely situated the origins of modernism in the Crystal Palace ; the very title was to confront notions on \"space -time\" by arguing for a unive rsal joint as critical to making architecture. Informed by techniques of prefabrication , space frames provided aesthetic and technical succour to the megastructural movement; accompanied by rhetoric on temporariness , they offered the kinds of forms envisioned in the van Ginkels' recollection of nineteenth -century ferro -vitreous works. Expo 67 would, upon opening, be seen in these effects. The magazine Progressive Architecture , which had been championing megastructures, renamed the world's fair \"Man and His Space Frame\".137 Page after page showed detailed assemblies, photographs judiciously cropped, even inverted to negative, emphasising the extraordinary effects of cantilevers, lightweight envelopes, and serialisation (fig. 3.23 Daylight\" (Fuller's dome), \"Tensioned realignment of aesthetics and science that had generally been divided since the mid -nineteenth century - a tendency seen, for example, in scientists dismissing the likes of Goethe and his interests in optics, morphology, and comparative anatomy (precisely the things resurrected in Kepes's \"patterns\" discourse) as merely artistic intuition and not scientific concepts. On this split between art and science, see: Lorrain Daston and Peter Galison, Objectivity (Brooklyn NY: Zon e Books, 2007), 246- 251. 137 Forrest Wilson, \"How the Pavilions Were Designed\", Progressive Architecture (June 1967): 133. Among the first important compilations of megastructural tendencies for American audiences, Progressive Architecture produced a special issue on \"Aesthetics and Technology of Preassembly\" in October 1964. It opened with a portfolio of ideal cities - from the Japanese Metabolists to projects by Candilis -Josic-Woods - and concluded with detailed studies on industrialised building techniq ues. Later, at Expo 67, \"space frame\" was liberally applied to any number of so- called \"experimental\" structures; see, for example, in James Ackland, \"Expo: The Space Frame Fair\" Arts Canada (April 1967): 4- 8. 176 Membrane\" (Ontario), \"Anchored Cable (Israel), or \"Space-Frame Integration\" (Man the Producer and Man the Explorer), among many others, the demand was the same: \"Where else but in the atmosphere of 'let's find out' of a fair are these experiments to be made?\" 138 The question was rhetorical, intentionally capturing any number of exercis es in prefabrication and alternative geometries as polemics on \"cellular\" or \"cluster\" structures. The celebration of innovative architectural technics could, in 1967, only recall a missing project. Alone among publications, Progressive Architecture would open its detailed look at the exhibition by printing four drawings of \"the fair that nearly was: A fair planned but shelved, which would have made architectural history.\" 139 Never named, it was Man and the Polar Regions shown in its un seen diagrams, mentio ned as the work of three Harvard graduates, and imagined as \"a form of plug -in architecture less esoteric but certainly more tangible than any projects published in Archigram .\" Faced by remarkable works, from Buckminster Fuller's geodesic dome for the Uni ted States to Frei Otto's tensile membranes for West Germany, which its editors duly admired, the magazine nevertheless admitted nostalgia for a future that never was, for a map of the world that, in early autumn 1963, unknowingly awaited splintering. 138 Wilson, \"How the Pavilions Were Designed\", 133. 139 \"How the Fair Was Planned\", Progressive Architecture (June 1967): 127.

Miller had, of course, wor ked with Ad\u00e8le Naud\u00e9 on Man and the Polar Regions, and included its diagrams in his article. See: Miller, \"Expo 67: A Search for Order\", The Canadian Architect (May 1967): 44- 54. 177 PLANS, REDUX Still, the problem of the plan remained. Safdie and Miller's \"elongated\" vision was, in a sense, to reject the world exhibition entirely, to replace its architecture by movement systems that were meant only as ciphers of an ideal, massive future conurbation. If their \"elongated\" plan was perhaps to return some vestige of Man in the City, then it was only in making the exhibition a matter of urbanism. The core argument carried since the PQAA deliberations on the world's fair - namely, the aesthe tics of movement offering \"varied visual experiences\" by a \"principle of the linear -cellular operation of space\" - was somewhat at odds with the entirely fantastic scape - a high -speed linear city - being proposed. 140 This was not an argument on form per se (though it would become one); rather, it was, again, an issue of speed . Seen in terms of the van Ginkels' demands always to reduce \"fatigue\" by the kinds of aesthetics that Giedion would have described as exhibiting effects of \"interpenetration\", the visual narrative - a city seen through a constellation of overlapping but newly appreciable images - was to reintroduce the human motor as measure of perceiving the city anew.141 Unlike deeply modern - that is, emergent in the nineteenth century - notions on l abour power as converting the making of things (including the very buildings upheld by the van 140 V. Prus et al., \"Mise en Sc \u00e8ne\" (Province of Quebec Association of 141 Anson Rabinbach, The Human Motor: Energy, Fatigue, and the Origins of Modernity (Berkeley and Los Angeles: The University of Calif ornia Press, 1990). Rabinbach defines the \"human motor\" as a metaphor of work and energy that provided nineteenth -century thinkers with a way of describing a new scientific and cultural framework. It was, in short, both a mechanism for and a result of th e industrial revolution. 178 Ginkels as necessary to reconceptualising postwar architecture) into visions of social modernity, this late modern restoration of physiognomy was accompanied by a challenge to modernist orthodoxy: the urban discourse borrowed from Lynch, via Kepes, pace Wiener - namely, an argument on repairing the urban environment by processes of visual \"feedback\" - owed to cybernetics as a bulwark against entropy. Against disorder, the exhibition movement systems - literally, loops of repeating but always perceptually different circulation - were to restore both the individual's view of the \"world\", now arrayed in any number of buildings, themes, and nations. The technical fix was already part of Safdie and Miller's plan: not the high -speed trains but \"horizontal elevators\" and moving sidewalks, in other words the slowest of the proposed movement systems - on the one hand , fast enough to approximate driving in the city; on the other hand, slow enough to feel like walking in it. In both, the condition of a mass but communal movement of people past things would be paramount. The idea was not necessarily novel. Moving platforms had animated visions of the modern city since the l ate-nineteenth century - and showcased as prototypes in world exhibitions. A two -speed system running in a one -mile loop was built at the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago. The same engineers realised the 2.5 -mile trottoir roulant at the 1900 Paris Ex position Universelle, where two parallel platforms, raised above the fairgrounds, moved at speeds of 2.5 - and 5 -miles per hour, allowed people easily to step on and off, and ran for twelve hours a day; over eight months, six -and-half million people would ride the \" rue de l'Avenir \". Throughout the early twentieth century, such systems - really, any 179 kinds of technologies of transmission , including radio, believed to upend the limits of the city - were popularised in sources like Scientific American or Amazin g Stories as anticipating a millenarian shift from work to leisure proffered by the liberating mechanisation of life. Such technologies would reappear - as discourse - in the early 1960s, not only for their obvious science fiction charm but as possibiliti es, once again, to upend CIAM urbanism. Team 10 member Brian Richards, who had assisted Daniel van Ginkel and others on prepar ing the \"Doorn Manifesto\", was busy circulating photographs of and data on movement systems in efforts to counter \"the destruction of construction of city centres today\" produced by the private car while recognising its convenience and \"delight\".142 Eventually published as New Movement in Cities in 1966, Richards's research - with its repeating images of precisely those moving sidewa lks (with notably Japanese provenance and appearing in airports worldwide) and monorails described by Safdie and Miller - exhibited a particular technological utopianism largely alien to Team 10 but otherwise kept with the group's desire to discover alternative means of designing the city. It was, in other words, an argument for the non- orthogonal - again, the discovery of means to reduce \"fatigue\". The Expo 67 plan was conditioned by these concerns for more \"open\" experiences of movement. P rior to pursui ng urban design at Harvard , Naud\u00e9 had been strongly influenced by Richards while studying at the Architectural Association .143 When tasked with designing the spaces - literally the fairgrounds - meant to lead visitors from one theme precinct to the 142 Brian Richards, New Movement in Cities (London: Studio Vista, 1966), n.p., inside cover. 143 Ad\u00e8le Naud\u00e9 Santos, interview with author (October 17, 2008), Montreal. 180 next, sh e would combine Richards's discourse with that of Shadrach Woods , her other mentor. In his 1962 concept of \"web\", Woods began seeking a way \"to set up systems (intellectual frames)\" - themes , in the parlance of the world's fair designers; imageability , in Lynch's lexicon - specific kinds of forms: \"non -centric initially, poly -centric through use\".144 The resulting urban plans, particularly for new towns in France, were predicated on a certain aspect of Team 10 discourse that drew on the German geographer Walter Christaller's prewar research, which showed how normal market activity in southern Germany invariably producing a hexagonal network of towns and roads. Elements in postwar international planning circles took this as proof that pure geometry was found not only in nature but also appeared as the effect of normative, unplanned human behaviour.145 Naud\u00e9's studies on \"Activity Areas\" followed suite. Anticipating needs to accommodate instantly a mass population, Naud\u00e9 so ught a \"planning tool\", like \"web\", to organise spaces for visitor services, commercial facilities, and small exhibitions. She began conceiving of complexes - \"highly urban\" and \"highly imageable\" - that, by \"using a repetitive system\", would create \"clarity\" in the exhibition. 146 The conscious turn to Lynch - to consider how fairgrounds of buildings, parks, and civic life could be made intelligible - 144 Shadrach Woods, \"Web\", Le Carr\u00e9 Bleu 3 (1962): n.p . 145 For Te am 10, and especially in projects like Toulouse -Le Mirail, this was often the somewhat cynical translation of medie val fabric in functionalist terms as means of engendering everyday life. The impact of Christaller's theories on Candilis -Josic-Woods is discussed by Roger Sherwood in \"Toulouse Le Corbusier also drew on Christaller's theory when developing ideas on the linear city in the 1930s that led to his book Les Trois Etablissements H umains of 1944; see: Frampton, A. Naud\u00e9, \"Activity Areas\" (June Fonds Gilles Gagnon, Canadian Centre \"web\" geometries: with \"movement\" as \"the organising element\", a series of honeycomb cluster s with staggered branches - \"the areas create nuclei, but also the spines which cross the major paths\" - were to provide \"a change of experience in density, in activity, and atmosphere\" (fig. 3.24). Like Man and the Polar Regions, what mattered above all was creating \"connector buildings in physical and mental terms\". On the one hand , returning to Lynch's imageability and resituating human perception as agent of the city, the fairgrounds were, as diagrams, to formalise what Walter Benjamin had once described as the pedestrian's \"serpentine gait\". As Naud\u00e9 put it, the \"angle of horizontal movement relates to the angle of pedestrian flow i.e. 120\u00b0 (not 90\u00b0)\".147 On the other hand, the very idea of providing a priori patterns seemed to contradict the heuristic procedures that would give life to things like Man and the Polar Regions as the utopian paradigm of Expo 67. This tension appeared in one final and critical step leading to the master plan. It resulted from Safdie and Miller's studies. The ideas on mov ement systems would be taken up by Steven Staples, one of the three Harvard graduates working under van Ginkel, and transformed into the Expo Express, a train linking the Cit\u00e9 de Havre (the gateway to the world exhibition and site of its permanent structures, including Habitat 67) to the islands, and the Minirail, a monorail bought as surplus stock from the 1964 Swiss National 147 Ibid., 3. Jerry Miller, who had worked on Man and the Polar Regions, described these unfulfilled plans after Expo 67 officially opened: \"The paths and storyline (particular parts of which had special interest for particular nations) resulted in an organization to which the nations could \" plug-in\". It is important to note that this was not a megastructure, but a three -dimensional organization with established rights -of-way.\" Miller's somewhat disingenuous defence against a post facto misreading of the first intentions on the master plan indicates the popularity of \"megastructure\" in the late 1960 - a term not necessarily in popular parlance when Naud\u00e9 and others were working under van Ginkel. 182 exhibition in La usanne and used for circulation within the fairgrounds (fig. 3.25). When developing the final design of the Expo 67 transportation networks in 1966, Staples would write: The stations of the primary transportation system were to be closely linked with the Theme structures so that not only was the Theme exhibit the first thing a visitor was exposed to as he came onto each area, but he could also capture the essence of the Exhibition by riding the primary system and stopping only at the Theme exhibits. The plan was to be analogous to the human body with the transportation network as the skeletal structure, the subdivisions of the Theme as the vital organs and the other pavilions as the fleshing out of the body. 148 Staples described the final master plan, in which the themes had been made to retreat into individual pavilions positioned as nodes throughout the fairgrounds. I n the bio -physical analogy, transportation was obviously to be the means of circulation . It was the Minirail, running on three different loops around the islands at speeds similar to the slowest systems first outlined by Safdie and Miller, that, in Staples's view, provided experiences most akin to Lynch's theory: \"Their transportation function is not as important as the exposure they give to all parts of the areas they serve.\"149 Staples had studied under Lynch and his approach was strongly marked by The Im age of the City.150 To ride the transportation systems was to 148 S.M. Staples, \"Transportation Network at EXPO 67\", Architecture Canada (August 1966): 33. The transportation systems were examined carefully by the planning establishment, especially those seeking to redefine \"urban design\" in the 1960s. For a symptomatic (though not always complimentary) appraisal, which mentions Staples and his designs, see: Den ise Scott Brown, \"Planning the Expo \", Journal of the American Institute of Planners (July 1967): 268 -270. Critics with a penchant for technological fixes found much to admire; see, for example, Reyner's Banham's enthusiastic review of the \"transportation marvels\" (\"the best fun of the fair\"): \"L'Homme \u00e0 l'Expo\", New Society (1 June 1967): 811 -813. 149 Staples, \"Transportation Network at EXPO 67\", 34. 150 Steven Staples, interview with author (October 14, 2008), Toronto. Staples notes that Lynch's seminar, given at MIT in the late 1950s, was essentially the same as The Image of the City . Staples was equally shaped by 183 encounter a kind of personal planning device. Lynch's imageability proposed a city \"apprehended over time as a pattern of high continuity with many distinctive parts clearly interconnected\"; as such, the \"sensuous grasp upon such surroundings would not be simplified, but also extended and deepened\": ...we must learn to see the hidden forms in the vast sprawl of our cities. We are not accustomed to organizing and imaging an artificial environment o n such a large scale; yet our activities are pushing us toward that end.151 There was, perhaps, something almost cynical in the effort to restore meaning to the blighted cityscape at the very moment it underwent urban renewal . 152 Lynch was, after all, attempting to render the sentimental as statistical. Yet his \"artificial environment\" was, at least for the Expo 67 architects, far removed from any existing city - it stood to be idealised and tested on its own terms. Technologies like the Minirail would allow visitors to stitch together aspect of the plan while floating above the fairgrounds. If the original impetus was to negotiate the \"world\" through the many aspects of \"man\" made appreciable in an immersive experience of endless loops of circulation, then the Minirail could never really facilitate the movement through things but simply between them. In one of the very few - maybe only - instances of experientially entering the \"world\", the monorail would penetrate Buckminster Fuller's geodesic dome, bringing people deep inside a new \"globe of iron\". the planner David Crane's notion of \"capital web\". Crane, who had been a research assistant to Lynch and Kepes, began teaching urban design at the University of Pennsylvania in 1957 and was the chief planner for the Boston Development Authority between 1961 and 1965, when he elaborated the concept of \"capital web\" as a network of links between public infrastructures in the city core. 151 Lynch, The Image of the City , 10, 12. 152 Martin, The Organizational Complex: Architecture, Media, and Corporate Space, 138. 184 Otherwise, visitors simply travelled over the fairgrounds and pavilions. Looking down, at what was largely a grid of Terre des Hommes , they would see an enormous spectacle but, perhaps , little more. In a sens e, the transportation systems marked the end of the first and perhaps most utopian ideas on Expo 67 . The critique of orthogonality coded in Naud\u00e9's landscape studies or in Staples's transportation networks was levelled against the Cartesian organisation of space of modernism. Yet the spatial division - Activity Areas below, monorails above - left nothing in between. The plan could only but become fragmented, made into a series of episodes that, finally, became individual pavilions on separate plots of la nd. As they elaborated the master plan in autumn 1963, Daniel van Ginkel's architects faced the political realities of the world exhibition. The aim had always been to see architecture and urbanism in concert: forced to relinquish the city site, the architects had transposed this ideal to Man and the Polar Regions. Even as this pavilion -cum -master plan synthesised the ambitions sketched out at Montebello, there was, however unconsciously, something almost fatalistic in the idea of the theme \"precincts\" - namely, the eventual isolation of things in the plan. By the end of the summer, the original CCWE commissioners, Cecil Carsley and Paul Bienvenu, had resigned. Like many others, they were disappointed by the move to the islands and fearful of future costs . 153 Robillard would soon depart, leaving van Ginkel as 153 Bob Hayes, \"Carsley Resigns World's Fair Post\", The Montreal Gazette (August 27, 1963): 1. For Bievenu and Carsley's travails, see: Ramo nd Grenier, Regards sur l'Expo 67 (Montreal: Les Editions de l'Homme, 1965), 65-72. 185 master planner. Yet with the new Commissioner General Pierre Dupuy, a seasoned diplomat brought out of retirement, came a new administration, including Edward Churchill, the new Director of Installations, and Eduoard Fiset, the chief architect, under whom van Ginkel was now be obliged to work. Car sley and Bienvenu had been deeply sympathetic to the Montebello ideals and desired an exhibition that subordinated nations to themes. Dupuy brooked little of this ambition and began seemingly ceaseless grand s tours to press worldwide participation at Expo 67. With each step, with each additional country committed to the fair, the architects' plans splintered. The loss of the city site was the first retreat; the division of the islands into nations was a final defeat. On December 3, 1963, the van Ginkel team delivered its master plan. On December 4, van Ginkel was no longer in charge of the design. Charges of being fired or having resigned were levelled. 154 It mattered little. The plan - \"This will be expo 67... 600 acres of the greatest spectacle the world has ever seen!\" - bore little trace of the counterforms that were to organise a city, indeed a world, in miniature (fig. 3.26).155 Instead, following Dupuy's missions, the islands appeared atomised into plots, each awaiting individual 154 \"Planner's Contract Over - He's Amazed\", The Montreal Star (December 4, 1963); H.P. Daniel van Ginkel, Press Release (December 5, 1963), n.p., Series 27 -A21-03, Fonds va n Ginkel, Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal. The Star carried news that the CCWE had terminated its contract with van Ginkel Associates as consultants. In the same article, van Ginkel was quoted as saying that he had resigned a weeks earlier in his capacity as chief planner. In a press release, van Ginkel noted: \"We are preparing at present a full report which deals with the more underlying causes which led to my resignation\". Released in mid -December, the report criticised the islands plans an d mentioned the ongoing cost overruns for dredging and fill. As remedy, van Ginkel recommended abandoning the island, depositing the fill at Point -Saint -Charles site, and returning the exhibition to its thematic basis. See: Untitled report (December 17, 1963), Series 27- A21-11, Fonds van Ginkel, Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal 155 Moshe Safdie claimed authorship of the final master plan concept; see: Safdie, Beyond Habitat (Cambridge MA: The MIT Press, 1970), 16, 65 -71. 186 expressions of nations and corporations, precisely those powers once wished banned at Montebello. Instead of the networks proposed by Naud\u00e9 and others, everything now seemed to follow a gridiron. Huge tracts of water showed throughout - a last -minute provision of lakes by designers suddenly realising that, despite Drapeau's promises, Montreal could never complete the dredging and filling promised within the coming half year. Van Ginkel's resignation marked the end of an extraordinarily fertile project. In eighteenth months, the Montreal architects had gone to the heart of debate s on the ideal modern city, recalling prewar aspirations and shaping postwar reforms. In a complete reversal, the plan would be presented to Dupuy in terms that he may well have advanced: A further reason for the proposed layout is that it splits up the pavilions in such a way that it is possible to avoid the problems which arise under geographic distribution. That is to say, it is no longer necessary to place the small Polish pavilion close to the large Russian pavilion, or the South African pavilion with other African countries, or small Canadian Provinces with large Canadian Provinces, or Israel next door to other Middle Eastern countries.... Finally, by avoiding formal groupings of pavilions, we emphasize that our theme is \"Man and His World\" rather than \"Man and His Group\". 156 The unsigned memorandum, likely owing to Robert Shaw, the new deputy commi ssioner general under Dupuy, would note, \"I believe that the planners have done an excellent job of taking full advantage of the beauties of our river site through this type of plan.\"157 Here, in 156 \"Memorandum to Mr. Pie rre Dupuy, Draft \" (December 3, 1963): 4, Box PF12, Folder 58/100/Pf5/27, Moshe Safdie Archive , Architecture Collection, McGill University , Montreal . 157 \"Memorandum to Mr. Pierre Dupuy, Draft \" (December 3, 1963): 6, Box PF12, Folder 58/100/Pf5/27, Moshe Safdie Archive , Canadian Architecture Collection, McGill University , Montreal . Shaw made the same declaration when publicly announcing the final master plan; see: Peter Desbarats, \"Master Plan Unveiled For The Montreal Star (Dece mber 23, 1963): 1. 187 finally defining the veritable Terre des Hommes , the picturesque finally trumped the political. There could be neither the utopian gesture of countries realigned nor an ironic signal of geopolitics clashed. Over 65 nations, 20 corporate interests, five non-governmental organisations, two religions, seven official theme pavilions, and many administrative structures, to say nothing of a popular amusement park added to the easternmost tip of Ile Ste -H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, would divide the Expo 67 master plan. If any cohesion remained in 1967, then it lay in a series of official theme pavilions to be designed by different architects . The \"distinctive visual character\" of each pavilion would, the CCWE hoped, make the Expo plan \"recognizable as theme\".158 Terre des Hommes was finally divided into five themes: Man the Explorer, Man the Producer, Man the Creator, Man in the Community, and Man the Provider. Each was to be defined throughout 1964 and 1965 by advisory committees on science, medicine, and fine arts elaborating \"aspirations towards building a better world\". 159 Yet the accompanying pavilions - generally all exceptional designs - would be scattered throughout the fairgrounds, upheld by the CCWE as \"backbone\" of the exposition but really bringing the earliest idea on \"precincts\" to an inevitable conclusion. It was a difficult proposition to maintain, given the final crowding by national, corporate, and cultural pavilions - \"A Phantasmagoria of Expo 67\", as the magazine Progressive Architecture would note (fig. 3.27). There remained, then, a 158 Affleck et al. , \"Preliminary Report on Theme - Site Study\" (July 17, 1963): 1; Canadian Corporation for the 1967 World Exhibition, Pavilion Architecture (Ottawa, 1965) , 1. 159 Canadian Corporation for the 1967 World Exhibition, The The me Man and His World (Ottawa, 1965), 3. 188 lingering desire for a possibly lost project: not only to present types of knowledge (\"themes\") as the binding agent of Expo 67, but to advance architectural innovation as a public culture in itself . As Progressive Architecture also noted when recalling the forgotten, indeed unknown, plan for Man and the Polar Regions: The major theme pavilion concept that was squashed in 1963 lingered long enough to influence the final planning stages, and, in bastardized form, was eventually built for the fair. Theme pavilions are now relatively small, beca use they shrank with successive budget appraisals and the will of Expo executives outside the planning department. 160 In fact, the pavilions were all quite large. None seemed, however, to satisfy the more visionary impulse believed resonant in the early Ex po 67 plans. *** Still, the \"bastardized form\" recognised by Progressive Architecture would actually appear in two critical ways. Both were to become theme pavilions, emerging from concepts begun as design and extended as discourse over the previous eight een months. In entirely different ways, both were to stand as proof of theories, whether burgeoning or failing, on \"megastructure \". The first appeared in the December 1963 master plan. The islands were fragmented by pavilions; but Cit\u00e9 du Havre, the newly reclaimed city site providing a gateway to the exhibition, appeared as a series of chevrons and triangles, each drawn to suggest terraced half - pyramids. In comparison to the rest of the master plan, the shapes were positively enormous. They formed, in fact, a massive housing complex proposed by Safdie as a permanent exhibit 160 \"How the Fair Was Planned\", Progressive Architecture (June 1967): 127. 189 at Expo 67. Safdie had joined the Expo 67 team by insisting that he be allowed to moonlight on a housing project, the subject of his McGill thesis project completed under van Ginkel . Now, he had converted one of the three world's fair sites to his project. The preliminary drawings, reminiscent of plans he had developed for the Meadowvale new town, appeared at the scale once imagined for things like Man and the Polar Regions. It wo uld soon be known as Habitat 67. For now, it was called by a forgotten name: Man in the City. The second arose in the coming year, when the theme pavilions were put out to competitive bid. It was to be the closest approximation of Man and the Polar Regio ns realised at Expo 67 - not necessarily in the polemic of realigning themes but in the ambition to advance an utterly novel architectural technics. (It would, for entirely different reasons, also convey the labyrinthine qualities of space imagined in Man and the Polar Regions.) Designed by Arcop, the Montreal office whose partners had assisted the van Ginkels from the start, this work, Man the Producer, would, along with its sister pavilion Man the Explorer (which had, after all, been the first articulat ion on \"man\" vis -\u00e0-vis the borrowings from Saint-Exup\u00e9ry), draw on a host of postwar discourses on situating long-span structures as the ultimate means for organising a new mass public. It is in this last that the CCWE made a critical contribution to the architecture of Expo 67. In late-1964, as nations began considered what, exactly, their national architectures were to be, the world's fair authorities would promote \"'cellular' construction\" - a \"'new direction' to the architects of the world\" to be see n in \"the building that will house Expo displays\" with \"flexible\" space permitting \"expansion or reduction as the need presents 190 itself\".161 The building was unnamed; but the preferred aesthetic suggested the lightweight and the demountable, the prefabricate d and the flexible. In both \"cell\" and \"flexibility\" were evocations of Team 10 and growth\" or Fumihiko Maki's \"collective form\". Crucially, the spatial analogy was equally a social metaphor. In the bio -structural model, which both pavilions would pursue, was, once again, an argument against rationalism. Instead of linear organi sation, continuous \"threads\" of circulation; instead of symbolic forms, \"modular\" structures without appreciable hierarchy; instead of singular functions, many practices and programs. It was a diagrammatic dream. All that remained, given the pressing reality of the world's fair, was to see just what such a theme pavilion look ed like. 161 \"'Cellular' Construction\", Expo Digest , Vol. 1, No. 20 (November 18, 1964): 1- 2. 191 Chapter 4: Tetrahedra Arithmetic! Algebra! Geometry! Grandiose trinity! Luminous triangle! Whoever without sense! Comte Lautreamont (Isidore -Lucien Ducasse), Les chants de Maldoror (1869) The earliest desire was to organise t he \"world\" singularly through architecture. Well before the official announcement of Expo 67 , Daniel van Ginkel and Blanche Lemco van Ginkel, along with their architect allies , made proposals in which \"The Problems of Man \", \"The Aspirations of Man \", \"The Needs of Man \", \"The Environment of Man \", \"The Spirit of Man\", and \" The Family of Man \" were to constitute compo nents of a \"single structure\" meant to replace inherited not ions on the national pavilion , which they insisted had little place in a late-twentiet h-century international exhibition .1 Here lay a tension in the late modern view on contemporary history: on the one hand, the themes were to help introduce new nations, especially decolonising ones, into the \"family\" or \"world\" of \"man\"; on the other hand, the very same themes were to create a space of cultural appearance well beyond the lines of geopolitical alliance - in other words, outside typical norms of comparison. As such, the attempt to design the fair as a uniquely massive pavilion was to unite (or reconcile) all forms of human production via common \"storylines\". Insid e and throughout, a comparative narrative of \"man\" would unfold. Nations would be subordinated to peoples; politics to knowledge; ideologies to themes . Like the colossal and still influential nineteenth - century precedents consistently invok ed by the architects conceiving Expo 67, this pavilion - 1 R. Affleck, Michel Chevalier, R. Canadian C entre for Architecture, Montreal . 192 as the fundamental mechanism and vessel of the fair - drew power from the belief that no other cultural manifestation, apart from a unive rsal exhibition, could properly achieve the ambition to synthesise the disparate output of humankind. The dream was short -lived. As the van Ginkels soon discovered, Expo 67 became prey to political expediency, its site atomised by the typical - and inevi table - demands to showcase nations. The resul ting heterogeneity of pavilions, could little convey the aspiration to discover a universal building system appropriate to org anising peoples and things and the mass experience of them. It was perhaps left to the popular transport systems, and the apparently omniscient view they afforded, to suggest that the site below composed some sort of meandering but unifying cultural map. The parsing of \"Man and His World\" nevertheless continued to inform the master plan. The earliest site studies had envisioned the entire fair organised by \"Thematic Precincts\" that would be essentially autonomous - each \"should allow great flexibility in the development and presentation of exhibition content\" - but demonstrating \"stron g architectural cohesion\".2 A \"precinct\" was a key theme pavilion; any other zone or building would, the planners believed, be secondary. This was to be the crucial legac y of the van G inkels' propositions. It appeared in one of the most consequential arc hitectures at Expo 67: the theme pavilion Man the Producer, a hulking steel colossuses derived from combinations of a single tetrahedral unit. With its 2 Affleck, Desbarats, Dimakopoulos, Lebensold, Sise, Report on Theme - Site Study\" (July 17, 1963): 1, Folder 9, Series 2, D03, 109- 26-TD, Fonds Guy Desbarats, Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal. 193 sister pavilion Man the Explorer, it embodied the earliest aims of exhibition: to express its modernity by experimental architecture and to house a mass public. As such, Man the Producer would draw on a unique trajectory in postwar architecture - advanced technics of space frames - to appear, at Expo 67, as proof of visionary ideas on the megastructure. X'S AND O'S Two desires had motivated initial ideas on the theme pavilions . The pavilion was, first and foremost, to synthesise all forms of human knowledge and material production, thereby obviating any national display or sentiment. Consequently, it was conceived as being flexible, not least owing to the unknown nature of exhibition contents . As much as this suggested a breathtakingly massive structure - in effect projected at the scale of all participating nations and corporations - it was, as the prel iminary studies had projected, also to be \"essentially inward looking\".3 Such architecture would constitute a deliberate withdrawal from the kitsch scenography of the more populist or celebratory aspects of world's fairs by creating an expansive inner rea lm for the qualitative com parison of peoples and things. In this new \"world\" set apart from the old, a new history of \"man\" was to be written. The resulting themes - Man in the Community, Man the Creator, Man the Provider, Man the Explorer, and Man the Producer - were not only to blur distinction between nations by enhancing common humanistic value and purpose of art, science, and industry; the creation 3 Ibid. 194 of \"storylines\" was also an approach to the spatial organisation of the fair. This had been the basis of Man and the Polar Regions, developed by van Ginkel's staff architects Ad\u00e8le Naud\u00e9 and Jerry Miller. In it, narrative \"threads\" offered mea ns to organise perceptual paths through the pavilion and its contents, providing alternative schemas of human produ ction; they also functioned, quite literally, as means to build the architecture. Working on the Expo 67 master plan in November 1963, soon before its final fragmentation into national plots, the young Expo 67 architects continued to imagine some kind of unifying structure capable of situating the entire exhibition. Drawing on Man and the Polar Regions, they began considering a \"Flexible service grid integrated with the structural system.\"4 Inside it, \"interwoven thematic sub -divisions\" were to obviate divisions between nations and themes by \"cyclical\" movement patterns allow ing \"the exhibition\" - as architecture - \"to be continuous\".5 The resulting form , made of \"continuous vertical circulation on inclined planes\", followed from the \"interwoven\" thematic sub-divisions. Naud\u00e9 gave it spatial elaboration: a sketch showing stacked box -like units , each one differentiated by Xs and Os or dots and voids, arranged to express the clustering of groups and extensions across a site (fig. 4.1). Seen together, the overall composition indicated some form of standardised assembly, piled high without hierarchy and, importantly, lacking preconceived formal order. 4 Ad\u00e8le Naud\u00e9 and Jerry Miller, \"Organization of the Thematic Area\" (November 19, 1963): n.p., Private Collection of Steven Staples, Toronto. 5 Ibid. 195 The idea was to provide a universal form of knowledge as expressed by a universalising architectural technolo gy. Without using the term \"megastructure\", Ginkel had , when writing to Kenzo Tange several months earlier to rally support for the world's fair, suggested some kind of sufficiently massive and organising \"framework\" to which nations could add respective architectural components .6 Well before Naud\u00e9 and her colleagues submitted their ideas on a new mega -pavilion, the van Ginkels' confrere Michel Chevalier, working throughout 1963 on elaborating the world's fair theme, argued that the exhibitionar y basis of Expo 67 could be aggregates of specialised information collected from across disciplines - a process that would also have direct architectural corollary. Writing in a series of \"Position Papers\" developed throughout the summer of 1963, Chevalier posited defining the Expo 67 theme by \" a rigorous system of analysis and feedback \" that could establish areas of agreement and dissent, eliminate \" bias\", and arrive at \" a broad consensus of agreement \". 7 Feedback - the principle of informational self -regulation crucial to the increasingly popular science of cybernetics - would help to winno w choices, creating an ideal framework both designable and appreciable (by the public). It would, as a tool, also enable the rapid collection a nd synthesis of informat ion in a \"consensus\", but one presumably open to change. This approach had, for Chevalier, architectural precedent: \"In this connection...

Hence the \"multi-dimensional 8 Ibid. Neumann, Chevalier explained, \"talks in terms of occupying a much smaller area than is usually the case to create a tightly -knit and comprehensive show. The space factor, if restricted in this way, would help solve some of the site planners' difficult problems.\" 9 Alfred Neumann, \"Morphologic Architecture\", Journal of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada (May 1963): 40- 47. 10 M.

The study group comprised Neumann, van Ginkel, Gilles Gagnon (who, as Layout Architect with the CCWE Architectural Branch, would take charge of implementing the Expo 67 master plan in 1964,), Guy Legault (a staff architect with Montreal's Service de l'urbanisme, who had consulted with the van Ginkels on early choices for the site), and the Montreal architects Davi d Bourke and Harry Mayerovitch . 11 Ibid., 12 -13. 197 pattern\": as much as visitors would see actual things (artefacts, displays), it was the emphasis on \"choice\" (\"storylines\") that inspired an architectural solution. Naud\u00e9 's sketch drew on this formulation . Her previous work on the master plan had evinced the influence of Team 10 member Shadrach Woods 's \"web\" theory that sought a limitless urban form in network s of circulation and support systems aimed at unif ying diverse activities.12 The notion of using movement patterns to organis e \"storylines\" as the basis of the theme pavilion architecture precisely followed this concept. Now, another influence appeared to Naud\u00e9 and her colleagues : the visionary architect Yona Friedman's \"mobile urbanism\".13 As Groupe d'Etudes d'Archite cture Mobile (GEAM) in the late 1950s, Friedman proposed not the architecture of moving parts but of flexibility, one that could be adapted to changing social needs and personal desires. \"New constructions\", he insisted, must \"be demountable and moveable\" and \"be transformable at will by the individual inhabitant.\" 14 In his impressionistic sketches, Friedman's interventions took the form of a multilevel inhabitable lattice floating above the ex isting city (fig. 4.2). A grid of elongated pilotis supported a continuous three -dimensional framework connected by crosswise struts or by circular braces. The expression was explicitly anti-formal . 12 Tom Avermaete, Another Modern: The Postwar Architecture of and Urbanism of Candilis -Josic-Woods (Rotterdam: NAi Publishers, 2005) , 303. 13 Ad\u00e8le Naud\u00e9 Santos, interview with author (October 17, 2008), Montreal. 14 Yona Friedman, \"Program of Mobile Urbanism\" (1958), in Joan Ockman, ed., Architecture Culture 1943 - 1968 (New York: Columbia Books on Architecture/Rizzoli) , 274. As Ockman observes, Friedman developed his ideas partly as a critique of Team 10 and what he felt was the group's vag ue notions about its adopted themes on \"growth and change\", \"development\", and, of course, \"mobility\". Friedman attended the Team 10 meeting at Bagnols -sur-C\u00e8ze, France, in July 1960. 198 The schematic affinity of Naud\u00e9 's drawing to Friedman's urbanisme spatiale was hardly coincidental. The repetitive but equally dematerialised quality reinforce d precisely what was demanded by the theme pavilion: ease of construction and, importantly, temporariness. Crucially, Friedman and his GEAM colleagues had declared that \"the mobility of component parts\" - the \"interchangeable elements of construction\", including \"moveable floors and ceilings\" as well as more massive things such as shipping containers - will \"lead to the reintegra tion of those functions that have become divided.\" 15 Like many sources first informing the world's fair, this was a critique of CIAM functional town planning . In the schema of Expo 67, it offered a way to actualise the deeply humanistic project of re- presenting the \"world\" to \"man\": the \"reintegration\" of human associations and knowledge, via the experience of apparently never -ending \"storylines\", could, it was hoped, be transmitted by the capacity of a modular, thus reconfigurable, architecture. In the co ding of Xs and Os, infill and void, the presentation of both the fair and its architecture was to be essentially interchangeable. As much as the patterns evident in Naud\u00e9's key diagram indicated lines of organisation (through the apparent linking of infor mational \"threads\"), the equally dispersed arrangements pointed to a more open -ended approach to building. \"Where possible the threads of the story should be externall y as well as internally visible \", the Expo 67 architects argued .16 This was not simply a demand for didactic displays; rather it was to propose that, just as in the evolution of never -ending 15 GEAM, \"Programme for a Mobile Architecture\" (1960), in Ulrich Conrad s, Programs and Manifestoes on 20th-century Architecture (Cambridge MA: The MIT Press, 1970) , 168. 16 Naud\u00e9 and Miller, \"Orga nization Area\", n.p . 199 \"storylines\", the enmeshing of interior and exterior tended toward engendering a spontaneous building (and the experience of it). The pavilion \"Structur e\", as drawn by Naud\u00e9, was thus accompanied by a single demand: \"Temporary\". This came with six corresponding conditions: 1. System to be used for 5 parts of the theme in Ile Ronde, Ile Verte. 2. Modular space system to give a variety of spaces of the same order (for services, for exhibits). 3. System to allow for numbers of links between thematic sub -divisions. 4. System to accommodate movement patterns: services, people. 5. System to be able to grow or shrink. 6. System to allow variations in space closure.17 Growth , move ment, order , variation , variety : expressions of function and space stemmed from the demand to create a \"modular space system\". Regardless of its configuration, the theme pavilion was presumably to arise from standardised assemblies, adaptable to any landscape. This was not only an architectonic limit but a social ideal. The insistence on providing the \"same order\" throughout the building - regardless of what was displayed or by whom - meant that received cultural norms could be totally reorganised. Sinc e the nineteenth century, the typical taxonomies of world's fairs registered the unequal division of things and hence the uneven distribution of power among peoples. Yet as fraternal (though equally paternal) calls to order , the accepted mission of world' s fairs - from 1851 to 1939, the largest gatherings of people, in war or in peace, of all time - was fundamentally to effect mass education.18 This most daunting of mandates was what the van Ginkels had hoped to 17 Ibid. 18 Paul Greenhalgh, Ephemeral The Expositions Universelles, and World's Fairs, 1851 - 1939 (Manchester UK: Manchester University Press, 1988) , 1. Greenhalgh notes: \"By 1867\" - the year of 200 conjure in the scope of a \"total\" ar chitectu re. The belief was, in Naud\u00e9 's words, that through \"strong design\" the thematic pavilions \"can be used to organise the exhibition\".19 \"Strong\" did not mean monumental. Rather, it signified a capacity - a system - for overcoming conventional ideas on sy mbolising nations and peoples as the by-product of world's fairs . Yet any notion on architecture qua architecture - its formal or representational qualities - was here subordinated to the efficiencies of, first, quick assembly, and, second, endless re -comp osition. In this, the van Ginkels ' invocations of behemoth nineteenth - century ferro -vitreous architectures were now finding fulfillment. Extendable and capable of limitless permutation , Joseph Paxton's Crystal Palace had emphasised the how (process) over the what (form) (fig. 4.3).20 Moreover, it served as a vessel organising a viewing public and its perception of peoples and things collected from around the world. Still, even with the precedence of how over what, there remained in 1851 a discrepancy bet ween a building -as- Frederic Le Play's Colis\u00e9e de Fer for the Paris Exposition Universelle, which comparatively organised human production according to paths crossing both through nations and across similar trades - \"and increasingly so until the end of the century, it was the lower middle and artisan classes who were the desired audience for educational exhibits. By 1900, the 'masses' proper were referred to as being the true beneficiaries of learning, their intellectual development apparently being vital for the survival of Western civilization\" (21). As Richard D. Mandell observes, world's fairs also became the backdrop for academic conferences. The Paris show of 1900 included conferences on fisheries, libraries, publishing, dentistry, education systems, hypnotism, philately, photography, public health, numismatics, ornithology, and medicine (the largest at 6,000 delegates). See: Mandell, Paris 1 900: The Great World's Fair (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1967). 19 Ad\u00e8le Naud\u00e9, \"Visitor Needs on Site\" Folder 50/100/PF5/27, Moshe Safdie Archive, Canadian Collection, McGill University, Montre al. 20 Kenneth Frampton, \"Industrialization and the Crises in Architecture\" (1973), in K. Michael Hays, ed., Oppositions Reader (New York: Princeton Architectural Press, 1998), 47-49. Frampton argues : \"Clearly the Palace would not in any classical sense o f the word said to have been composed and indeed, had it not been for a last minute outcry over tree preservation, it would have been erected without its central transept - the one feature which served to impart a certain fortuitous symmetry to its otherwise undifferentiated facade.\" 201 exhibition and the exhibition as an array of objects: the former crystallising primary systems of production and distribution , the latter completing the creation of instant culture s of consumption and the consequent establishment of a to tally new class .21 The Expo 67 theme pavilion was not to brook such a split. Lemco van Ginkel's earliest exhortation to \"return to the spirit of International Exhibitions of a century ago\" meant the \"complete adherence to a universally applicable theme.\"22 \"Theme\" was interchangeable with \"architecture\": human knowledge and spatial experience would be seamlessly integrated and made visible - thus universalised - in the pavilion 's technics. As indication of how the entire exposition was hoped to be built, the standardised components of the \"modular space system\", along with its varied assemblies, were quite literally expected to restructure the objects and nations on display, and the changing experience of them. Questions of monumentality, so crucial to th e symbolic purpose of world's fairs, were to be strictly avoided. A SYSTEM All that remained was to realise a suitable architecture. There was, however, a fundamental limitation: no one yet knew, in autumn 1963, what things - which artefacts - were to be displayed. The theme pavilion could not be designed according to the constraint of its contents. It could, however, be projected as forcefully re-conceptualising its subject matter , 21 Ibid. 22 Blanche Lemco van Ginkel, \"1967 39- 1990 -02-005, Fonds Gilles Gagnon, Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal. 202 whatever it may be, according to entirely new standards - that is, writ large in architectural \"storylines\" serv ing to reorder the \"world\" of \"man\". The very idea of \"storyli ne\" implied forms of continuity . In architectural terms, this corresponded to the call for creating a \"system\". As van Ginkel's young staff architects continued to advance the pavilion diagrams, his office issued further th oughts on the Expo theme. A memorandum on the \"CWE Theme\", prepared concurrently with the Naud\u00e9 's plans on \"Organization of the Theme Area\" Hommes' in 196 7\": a \"world in which isolation is no longer possible. A world which recognizes the interdependence of matter and the interdependence of man.\"23 With \"physical barriers to communication havin g been overcome,\" the notion of \"interdependence\" rested on eliminating \"the intangible barriers to communication between men\". Having done so, \"common problems\" would be \"recognized\" and solutions achieved as \"one people may draw upon the experience of another in the realm of metaphysics as well as in the new technology.\" The utopian sentiment was, coming from the architects, tied to the double - coding of the \"storylines\": first, as an organising principle for the fair; second, as simultaneous means for rewriting world history and building its pavilion architecture. The \"interdependence \" of \"matter\" and \"man\" was here being formulated in the links between theme (\"threads\") and architecture (\"system\"). Within this infinite loop, the experiential continuity between \"storyline\" and \"structure\" was to be seen in concert; both, in turn, 23 Van Ginkel Associates, \"CWE Theme\" 15th, 1963): 1, Series A21 -04, Fonds van Ginkel, Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal. 203 would work together to help shape the architectural proposition. Content (displays, knowledge, history) and form (pavilion) were to be mutually appreciable. Here, then, lay the desire for \"system\". The total reconceptualisation of the social and space relations of \"Man and His World\" could be actualised only by a \"flexible\", architecture. On the one hand, t he impression of modularity jibed with the idea of maintaining a continuous datum of information (the actual circulation paths outlining a given \"theme\"); on the other hand, the deliberate parsing of a theme in interweaving \"threads\", as first sketched in Man in the Polar Regions, implied both a perceptual and informational mixing achiev able only by standardised, interchangeable architec tural components. This suggestion of \"feedback \" - of endless modification to a result (a theme, a building) by the factors producing it - lay at the heart of the pavilion as \"system\". In it was invocation of ascendant ideas of \"systems theory\" in the po stwar human sciences. Systems theory was the application of the principle of biological self -regulation (\"homeostasis\") to machines and society. It followed from a particular view of \"organicism\" in biology developed in the 1920s by Ludwig von Bertalanffy, who sought an appreciation of wholeness (regulation), organisation (hierarchy and laws proper to each level), and dynamics (process). By the early 1960s, von Bertalanffy had evol ved a \"General Systems Theory\" that offered a \"theory of organization\" applicable to any number of social, economic, or technological 204 questions.24 What mattered above all was the construction of \"wholes\" - whether social systems ( here \"themes\" or, really, world's fairs), economic models, or , indeed, architectural works - predicated on a continuous loop of information or user input. Taken to its extreme, it could only lead, in architectural terms, to the constant rebuilding of the structure itself. In this was a nascent but fundamental critique of modernism crucial to the plannin g of Expo 67. Whereas the holism espoused by the likes of Aldo van Eyck - Daniel van Ginkel's chief interlocutor - was posited on objective \"structures\" (existing independent of the subject) that established long -term cultural norms, the \"systems\" view he ld these very same criteria as dynamic thus open to change. 25 The van Ginkels' experience of Team 10 was steeped in such sentiment. If there was still to be some relevant idea of \"universal man\", as assured ly assumed in the Expo 67 theme, then it was to be modified by re -actualising human agency in the creation and perception of the urban realm. Naud\u00e9's use of Team 10 member Shadrach Woods 's \"web\" concept on her master plan studies consequently brought to bear an approach to urban design informed by the cybernetic qualities of systems thinking . In late 1962, the moment of the van Ginkels' early ideas on the world's fair , Woods had written : As long as societies were evolving within the limits of perceivable human groupings (villages and towns, classes, cas tes and sects), so long could architecture operate within the limits of purely visual disciplines. With the breakdown of these limits and as man evolves towards a universal society, the need is felt to discover a clear framework for planning and architecture at the new scale.... New systems of 24 Ludwig von Bertalanffy, \"General Systems Theory: A Critical Review\", in General Systems, Yearbook of the Society for the Advancement of General Systems Research 7 (1962) , 1-20. 25 Alan Colquhoun, Modern Architecture (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002) , 262 n25. 205 architecture are required.... The approach can no longer only be visual; we must call upon the whole range of sense, intellect and emotion to elaborate an architecture consonant with our aspirations.... Total space and universal society are interdependent; the one engenders the other. 26 Not unlike calls by prewar modernists , the postwar world was seen as becoming \"universal\". Yet there was difference. The Modern Movement had, as CIAM announced in its epochal \"La Sarraz Declaration\" of 1928, espoused a human subject, guided by forces of \"rationalisation and standardisation\", accepting the \"revision of his demands in the direction of a readjustment to the new conditions of social life.\"27 Woods insisted on the opposite. Instead of fixed limits (\"perceivable human groupings\", \"purely visual disciplines\" - the very criteria of typical world's fair pavilions), architectural design was to be open to far greater number of stimuli: \"sense, intellect and emotion\" - in other word s, cognitive, subjective bases for creating the built world, each intimately related and open to modification. Thus, \"interdependence\". The van Ginkel s' definition of Expo 67 - \"A world which recognizes the interdependence of matter and the interdependenc e of man\" - not only conveyed the sentiments of the Montebello conference but echoed Woods's influential formulation of a year earlier: \"Total space and universal society are interdependen t; the one engenders the other\" . 28 Sigfried Architecture , 110. The 1928 declaration emphasised building rather than architecture, indicating a certain constructivist line adopted by CIAM during its initial formation. 28 Van Ginkel Associates, \"CWE Theme\",1 ; Woods, \"Web\", n.p. 206 reciprocity of \"total space and universal society\", Woods sought \"systems\" or what he further called \"intellectual frames\" . The argument was for things \"sufficiently flexible to permit growth and change within themselves throughout the course of their lives\"; \"open in both directions, i.e. in respect to smaller systems within them as well as in respect to greater systems around them\"; and presenting \"in their beginning, an even over -all intensity of activity in order not to compromise the future.\"29 At stake was achieving what the M an and the Polar Regions report called \"coherence\". Just as Woods argued for \"openness\", with a \"web\" that can be \"plugged -into\" or \"plug in to greater systems at any point\", so the Expo architec ts sought \"horizontal independent \"national exhibits\") in their modifiable pavilion . The shared wish was, above all, not to establish any dominant narrative; thus the strategy of all nations \"plugging -in\" to the dominant \"storylines\" at any given point in the pavilion depending on cultural, material, or technological affinity (fig. 4.4). The idea was that \"understanding\" - or, for the Expo architects, \"coherence\" - would \"come through the perception of parts, as the whole system can never be seen.\"30 The dismissal of the \"whole system\" was, in Woods's view, an argument levelled against \"symbols and monuments\", against \"these crutches of authority\"; in their place was to b e alter nate form of \"planning\" that gave authority to users : \"The systems will be such that man can, within them, 29 Woods, \"Web\", n.p. Woods provided one example of \"Web\": the \"continuity of organization\" lent by the dalle, an elevated pedestrian network, to the Caen- Herouville and Toulouse -Le Mirail projects, which had so influenced Naud\u00e9's circulation patterns fo r the Expo master plan. He noted that \"Web\" was meant \"to designate Stem\" - an earlier concept of Woods informing Toulouse -Le Mirail - \"to the next degree\". 30 Ibid. 207 contribute to the creation of his own environment, and in doing so, ameliorate the total environment\".31 It was an uncanny echo of, first, the van Gi nkels' early charges levelled against typical world's fairs and, second, their justificatory quotation of Saint- Exup\u00e9 ry's humanism - \" To be a man is to feel that through one's own contribution one helps to build the world\" - that had set the tone of Expo 6 7 and its design. That system could be thought synonymous with pavilion (as an ex position in itself) was crucial: the world was, after all, being re-presented by \"intellectual frames\" construed specifically by architects. Technics of building would, ther efore, comprise the primary element of mass communication. The demand for growth , flexibility, and coherence in a theme pavilion was to connect knowledge - theme, history, display - to both the structure and the experience of an \"open\" architectural form . Instead of linear organisation, continuous loops of circulation; instead of symbolic forms, structures without appreciable hierarchy; instead of singular functions, different practices and programmes. It was a diagrammatic dream. All that remained, given the pressing reality of building the fair, was to see just what its pavilion would look like. TRIANGLES With Daniel van Ginkel's resignation as chief planner of Expo 67 in early December 1963, the impetus to design the theme pavilions took on added ur gency. While the young staff architects lost control over the pavilion design, turning their energies instead to master planning and site co -ordination, the thrust of their initial speculations continued, for now, 31 Ibid. 208 intact. By early 1964, the actual thematic subdivision be came formalised, with the parsing of \"Man\" into five categories, each with its own pavilion . The CCWE would consequently commission consulting architects for each theme pavilion . Private firms were to fol low guidelines set by the CCWE to interpret a given theme , later to be expanded by committees of outside experts, into architecture. The bidding process - on single buildings - was now the same as the national and corporate pavilions. Nevertheless, a residual attempt at \"coherence\" would remain - and appear in twinned pavilions dedicated to Man the Producer and Man the Explorer. These two giant works , hulking steel structures made by combining tetrahedral cells into massive space frames for both floors and walls , were , along with Habitat 67, the only results of the van Ginkels' very first ideas on the fair: namely, how to organise an entire exposition within a single built form (fig. 4.5). Man the Producer and Man the Explorer be came among the most -noticed and polemical architecture at E xpo 67. Of the two, Man the Producer, would be seen as fulfilling ambitions of the megastructural movement, not least by the simple fact that it exhibited less formal symmetry, thus lending an aura, especially when photographed, of remarkable spatial complexity and technological advance. The CCWE awarded Man the Producer and Man the Explorer to Arcop, an important architecture firm in Montreal. Founded in 1957 by Ray Affleck, Guy Desbarats, Dimitri Dimakopoulos, for \"Architects in Co -partnership\", had quickly achieved a national profile with large and important cultural commissions, especially arts complexes and university buildings, in Canadian cities. Much 209 of their work carried an idiom of refined conc rete with Brutalist overtones. Affleck had contributed to both the PQAA retreat and the Montebello conference, and his firm had, in April 1963, entered into joint venture with the van Ginkels to study the theme and site . By June, the CCWE made Arcop resp onsible for \"Physical Realization of the Theme \" in a \"semi-abstract sense \" - in other words, not an architectural but a diagrammatic outline of the dedicated \"Thematic Precincts\".32 These areas, not yet programmed, would define van Ginkel's master plan, placed as legible markers for the crowds anticipated as lost among the competing spectacles of national pavilions. As such, Arcop's approach to designing the Man the Producer and Man the Explorer would negotiate these conceptual poles: first, the ambition to map a world's fair at the scale of the city itself; second, the projection of a larger \"humanistic\" project that sought visionary architecture as the only means to convey the manifold aspects of Terre des Hommes . While the Expo 67 master plan showed thematic precincts, they were entirely without architecture. By late January 1964, this was of pressing concern. To members of the recently formed Advisory Committee on Architecture for the Canadian World Exposition, the design criteria were many - and unkn own. Writing to his fellow committee members, all bona fide postwar Canadian modernists, Douglas Shadbolt, an architect and leading pedagogue, listed the conditions: first, the theme buildings could not be designed until a finite space requirements became available; second, this finite 32 2, Fonds Guy Desbarats, D03.9 -109-26-TD, C anadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal. 210 be determined until the space was sold to exhibitors; third, foreign exhibitors had yet to be approached; fourth, the actual themes were not yet elaborated (there were no governing \"storylines\"); fifth, it could take up to one year, at minimum, to determine a detailed programme for the buildings; sixth, the construction schedule would necessitate starting the pavilions well before programming; and seventh, there would be a host of technical problems - site conditions, climatic variables, and transportation exchanges - that \"these so -called temporary buildings will have to cope with\". 33 Given this, the design possibilities were, in Shadbolt's view, clear: Under these circumstances there appear to be two sol utions: a. to decide arbitrarily on the building size and shape, and sell off space on a package basis and get on with it. or b. to design and prototype a building \"system\" of prefabricated components which could be manufactured on the site and which would al low the decision on the final plan to be deferred until the last possible moment by using the interim period to develop the building system. \"These two alternatives\", Shadbolt concluded, \"lead to different results\": The first would sabotage the theme idea as it is presently conceived as it would lead to pavilions of Science and Industry, Fine Arts, etc. The second would require that all theme buildings are built of the same system for economic reasons, which would provide the unity that the master plan suggests, providing it is flexible enough to meet widely varying plan conditions. This system gives the exhibition designers considerably more freedom to suggest modification of the building and should result in a more integrated total result. 34 With the Expo 67 master plan unveiled only a month before his assessment, Shadbolt already recognised the growing pressures bearing on the fair: either to follow typical norms of 33 Douglas Shadbolt, Letter to John C. Parkin (January 20, 1964): 1 -2, Parkin Archive PK -290, C anadian Centre for Architecture, Montrea l. 34 Ibid., 2. 211 allowing individual pavilions, however engaging; or to adhere to the early ambitions, as developed by Naud\u00e9 and others, for \"unity\" of the master plan achieved specifically by a comprehensive building \"system\". Even as the fair began to fill with national and corporate pavilions, just as Shadbolt had predicted, there remained the ambition to achieve an aspect of formal and spatial \"unity\". The theme pavilions would soon serve this purpose. On April 9, 1964, at the first meeting of the Executive Committee of the CCWE, Arcop was given \"limited mandate for the preparation of preliminary plans and cost estimation\". 35 Two months later, the firm was granted approval \"to undertake the design of both buildings\" (at this stage simply known as \"the Theme pavilions on Ile Verte and Ile Notre Dame\"). 36 This came, however, with a singular contractual demand: that \"the consultant\", Arcop, undertake \"extensive studies on the development of an unusual design of the structural system.\" 37 In this single bureaucratic edict lay a growing ambition: to see experimental architecture as a showcase in itself, expre ssive of the very kind of modernity Expo 67 was to embody. Between April and late June 1964, Arcop initiated its first designs of the theme pavilions. The functional need was, of course, to provide clear, unobstructed space for exhibiting the kinds of obj ects and things - still unknown - conjured by \"P roduction\" (and 35 \"First Meeting of the Executive Committee of the Canadian Corporation for the 1967 World Exhibition\" (April 9, 1964): 6, Canadian Corporation for the World Exhibition Fonds, RG71, Vol. 445, Library and Archives Canada, Ottawa . 36 \"Details of Request to the Executive Committee: Theme Complexes - Pavilion Buildings & Exhibits\", No. 100 (December 21, 1964): 1, Canadian Corporation for the World Exhibition Fonds, RG71, Vol. 445, Library and Archives Canada, Ottawa. 37 Ibid. 212 \"Exploration\") . As such, the initial but formative studies were on long -span structures. A longitudinal section , drawn in mid -June, revealed a grid of raised boxes, hovering over the master plan canals, connected by walkways to a transportation station, beyond to cantilevered platforms of a restaurant tower, and down to the waterways below (fig. 4.6). The scheme was unremarkable; still, the kernel of an idea emerged. In sketches accompanyin g the sectional drawing , Ronald Williams, a young architect working for Arcop, outlined different steel structural systems according to six Site\" (fig. long -span systems (including V ierendeel trusses), cantilever construction, and suspension structures (some with hanging modular units) were shown . The goal was a \"frame\" providing \"overall visual unity\" , an \"effect of lightness \" and \"transparency \", and \"a variety of volumes and backgrounds for different types of exhibit\" that \"may be used for 'representational' exhibits but is not visually sympathetic to them\".39 The possible structure was posited as bei ng \"value -free\": while giving an overall coherence, it was to offer an \"open\" spatial organisation and remain disentangled from any exhibits. One week later, the scheme irrevocably changed. The elevated boxes, with their thin struts and hovering walkways, were gone. Instead was a plan of hexagonal geometries with pathways obliquely crisscrossing the site and capturing and enclosing multi-sided 38 \"Steel System\", n.p., Series 64 -20-34, Fonds Arcop, Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal; Ronald Williams, interview with author (November 4, 2009), Montreal. Williams, a young architect at Arcop in 1964, authored the \"Steel System\" sketches while researching stru ctures appropriate to the theme pavilion programme. 39 Ibid. 213 The section rose similarly, with angles meeting to form triangulated spaces past which the floors now ca ntilevered (fig. 4.8). As notes on an accompanying sketch indicated, the need was to \"let people below be aware of the activities up above and vice versa\" . The overall impression was of much greater spans and of far more links, both spatially and visually, between different levels and across the site. The search for an appropriate building \"system\" rested on discovering a singular, repeating constructional element. Arcop's first study kept with Naud\u00e9's initial diagrams and compared systems essentially \"sympathetic to 'Cartesian co -ordinate' geometry with 3 mutually perpendicular axes\".40 With this, \"the use of steel frame in several structural expressions forms a spatial system of lines and planes in many combinations.\"41 In the emphasis on a \"spatial system\" was , however, the hexagonal exception: amidst the diagrams of \"modular\" steel constructions appeared a sketch of a \"cellular system\" derived from \"120 \u00b0 horizontal angles\" and \"sloping walls\" .42 A description of somewhat unusual planimetric and sectional space, it was the only sketch of its kind . It was not, however, a coincidence. As the Arcop team had continued to advance modular steel frames , its designers were summoned to a meeting. It was pivotal. On a warm, sunny Sunday afternoon in June 1964, the Arcop staff, all young designers, arrived at the home of Jeff rey Lindsay, an architect living in Beaconsfield, a western suburb of Montreal . A few months earlier, Lindsay had been 40 Ibid. 41 Ibid. 42 Ibid. 214 contracted by Arcop to research experimental structures for the theme pavilions .43 Invited by Lindsay's wife to join him in their backyard, the architects strolled down the gently sloping lawn bringing them to the edge of Lac St -Louis, part of the St Lawrence River. They found Lindsay waiting behind a table. Scattered on it were yellow cardboard models of triangulated structures: some with clipped corners, jo ined end -to-end at their apices; others arranged one on top of another, face-to -face, as diamonds (fig. 4.9). Many were composed only of thin frames while others were made entirely of planes . The impression was one of maximal points of contact and minimal wasted space between solids. Linked together by paper clips, the identical units combined to produce endlessly zigzagging clusters, where any notion of hierarchy or centrality appeared trumped by dispersal. The effect was galvanising. Nothing was left of \"Cartesian\" geomet ries, of grids. Instead were repeating nested shapes simultaneously expressing structural design, with the tetrahedrons forming truss -like planes, and space enclosure. Here, then, was indication of a \"system\" towards a pavilion: a single element, when combined, offering seemingly limitless combinations. The tetrahedral experiment was not without precedent. It was, in fact, rooted in Lindsay's imme rsion in the work and theories of Buckminster Fuller, the autodidact inventor and architect, whose geodesic domes became increasingly popular in the 1960s. Throughout the 1950s, Lindsay had advanced experimental architectures that borrowed principles from 43 Ronald Williams, interview with author (November 4, 2009), Montreal. As a junior architect at Arcop, Williams attended the meeting at Lindsay's home. 215 Fuller's famed geodesics and applied them to the broader applicability of space frames. These approaches, which would profoundly shape Man the Producer and Man the Explorer, offered an alternate, if iconoclastic, vision for postwar modernism, one based on finding a synthesis between industrial production and theoretical principles of \"growth\" as found in natural phenomena - in short, a stab at discovering flexible, adaptable solutions for \"universal\" design and need. Central to this ambition were questi ons on prefabrication and desires for lightweight structures. Fuller saw architecture not as end in itself but part of what he called \"design science\", a long-range economic and technological programme that related the problems of shelter to other surviva l tasks of transportation, food r esources, and energy harvesting; the aim was \"to make man a success in the universe\". 44 Fuller repeatedly asked, \"How much does your building weigh?\" An exhortation against material waste, thus for optimised structural and spatial efficiency, it led to Fuller's portable Dymaxion Deployment Unit of 1940 (otherwise a single -family house) and, by the late 1940s, his \"autonomous living package\" of a geodesic half -dome as a basic unit of shelter . Fuller would, indeed, be celebr ated for his spectacular 250 -foot diameter geodesic dome for the United States pavilion at Expo 67 .45 Yet he could also lay claim to other residual effects at the fair - notably, by Lindsay, who had, by the very early 1950s, already materialised Fuller's n ascent theories Encyclopedia of Architects Vol. 2 (New York: The Free Press, 1982) , 125. 45 Fuller had previously contributed smaller domes to exhibitions organised by the United States Information Agency (USIA), notably in Kabul (1956) and Moscow (1958). USIA also commission ed Fuller's dome at Expo 67. 216 geodesic s. Lindsay's indebtedness to Fuller and, more broadly, discourse on space frames research would decisively shape the design and experience of Man the Producer. GEODESICS Lindsay's first and crucial engagement with Fuller occurr ed as student. In 1948, demobilised after having served four years as a bomber pilot with the Royal Canadian Air Force, he joined a special seminar conducted by Fuller at the Chicago Institute of Design where, in 1937, the \u00e9migr\u00e9 artist L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy -Nagy had sought to re-establish the Bauhaus legacy of experimental design education. Without any previous formal training in architecture or engineering, Lindsay worked with Fuller for the next two years, first at the Institute and then at Black Mountain College in North Carolina, a progressive liberal arts college that held arts learning at the core of its teaching philosophy (fig. 4.10). Fuller found both schools ideal sites for experiment , initiating intensive modelling -based studios eventually culminating in the design and construction of geodesic domes by student teams . Lindsay's immersion in this applied pedagogy coincided with an especially decisive and fertile moment in Fuller's research. It stemmed from twinned investigations on the interrelations of geometry and structure. Two overlapping concerns preoccupied Fuller. First, exercises in topology, principally the segmenting and folding of spheres that could then be quantised into geodesic shapes - a process having produced the Dymaxion map of 1943, which minimis ed distortion when transfer ring data from a globe to a flat surface. Second, beginning in the late 1940s, studies on the close packing of solids, which followed from the 217 realisation that spheres grouped tightly around a central nucleus do n ot form a larger composite sphere but produce instead a cuboctahedron (a polyhedron with 14 faces comprised of six squares and eight triangles, with all sides of equal length) - a effect Fuller dubbed \"Vector Equilibrium\" and represented in models that, when seen, seemed made of infinite matrices, an expressive transmutation of solids into lines, a dematerialisation of definable shapes into things appreciably more weightless (fig. 4.11). 46 Both instances provided Fuller a way of designing \"as Nature sees he rself\", an approach owing to a belief that natural forms operate with co -ordinates other than the Cartesian system.47 While abandoning assumed norms of material and spatial order, this view o n \"Nature\" quickly coalesced -tetrahedral) truss, a unit of two parallel surfaces with a fully triangulated structure (fig. 4.12 ). Here, the phenomena of triangulation evinced in the close packing studies provided the basis for a primary constructional unit. A s Architectural Forum observed in 1952, this was a work in which \"the 46 The Dymaxion Map resulted from rendering a globe as a cuboctahedron. Fuller described his experiments in the close packing of spheres in \"Energetic Ge ometry\", an appendix to his book Earth Inc. (1947), reprinted in Joachim Krausse and Claude Lichtenstein, eds., Your Private Sky: R. Buckminster Fuller, The Art of Design Science (Baden, Switzerland: Lars M\u00fcller Publishers, 1999), 280. See also: R. Buckminster Fuller and Robert Marks, The Dymaxion World of Buckminster Fuller (Garden City NY: Anchor Books, 1973), 41ff.

Buckminster Fuller, The Art of Design Science, 286. Fuller stated: \"...the discovered synergetic system\" of the octet truss nature's spontaneously employed coordinate system, for it accommodates transformations by systemic, complementary symmetries of concentric, Work\", in Robert Marks, ed., Ideas and Integrities: a Spontaneous Autobiographical Discourse (1963; New York: Collier Books, 1969) , 21. 218 strength of the whole is greater than the sum of its parts \" - an effect Fuller called \" synergy \".48 The \"corollary\" to synergy was \" ephemeralisation \", of \"man continually doing more with less\", a \"trend\" Fuller believed, when writing in 1950, of an \"epochal nature\".49 That the octet truss could provide the faceted skin of a geodesic envelope - a spherical shape promising maximal enclosure with minimal material - was to follow from th is millena rian formulation (fig. 4.13). Building outward from organisational clues and capacities found in nature, a process of structural refinement would invariably give rise to more efficient, more ephemeral forms projected for an irreversible shift - that is, humanity's more efficient use of its resources - in both social need and architectural value. Fuller's research on geometry and structure dovetailed with contemporaneous desires to fashion a new \"organicist\" project, one aimed at reinvigorating modernism an d modern life. It would be posited on achieving models of wholeness by finding conceptual and vis ual affinities between artistic, biological, industrial forms. Moholoy -Nagy had, in 1937, defined the New Bauhau s pedagogy as \"bio -technique\": \"an attempt at a new science which shows how natural forms and designs can be translated without great difficulty into human production. This means that nature's ingenious forms can be reduced to technical ones.\" 50 48 \"Thru -way Floor Truss\", Architect ural Forum (November 1952): 149. As the magazine observed, the octet truss \"of tubular steel less than 6' deep supports 42 times its own weight\". Architectural Forum reported on the octet truss from North Carolina State College, a key site of Fuller's wo rk and teaching. Throughout the 1950s , the North Carolina State College Student Publication of the School of Design would be a crucial forum for discussions on experimental structures, including geodesics, in architectural design. 49 R. Buckminster Fuller , \"Comprehensive Designing\", Trans/Formations: Arts Moholy- Nagy, \"The New Bauhaus and Space Relationships\" (1937), in Richard Kostelanetz, ed., Moholy- Nagy: An Anthology (New York: de Capo Press, 1970) , 105. Moholy- Nagy attributed \"bio -technique\" 219 Immersed in the experimental teaching at the postwar Chicago Institute of Design, which continued the New Bauhaus programme , Fuller correspondingly advanced his comprehensive notion of \"synergy\" as a \"principle... manifested both in the inorganic and organic.\"51 In the context of his architecture, it echoed Fuller's unremitting attempt at correlating his geometries with a naturally occurring economy of means, which he and others saw as the basis for a new unity of art and science.52 Links between these realms were to be made by upholding phenomena found in the natural realm as visual evidence for the rational structuring of things in the \"man -made\" world. This search found Fuller in agreement with allied reformulations of architecture's relation to other disciplines, especially in the work of Gyorgy Kepes. Kepes, a Hungarian \u00e9migr\u00e9 painter and designer who taught at the Chicago Institute of Design and later at MIT (where he established the Centre for Advanced Visual Studies), had, beginning in the mid - 1940s, become a key supplier of scientific images of natural patterns to architectural discourse. Many images resulted from advanced techniques of magnification and revealed remarkable properties of geometric order and structural efficiency. The result was not only to Raoul Franc\u00e9. Franc\u00e9 was Hungarian biologist active in Berlin around 1900, whose book The Plants as Inventors (1920) emphasised that every natural \"process produces for itself its technical form\"; thus, \"all natural forms are crystalized processes\". The New Bauhaus also brought University of Chicago faculty to teach courses in the science and humanities - including the philosopher Charles Morris, an advocate of the Unity of Science framework, which was influenc ed by theories of pattern recognition advanced by Gestalt psychology. See : Eric Mumford, Defining Urban Design: CIAM Architects and the Formation of a Discipline, 1937 -69 (Yale University Press, 2009) , 22-23. 51 R.

The discourse crystallised in Kepes's influential book The New Landscape in Art and Science of 1956, in which prominent artists, architects, engineers, and scientists theorised parallels between organisational patterns visualised in their respective fields.53 The work, which offered an utterly breathtaking visual narrative, was instrumental to new kinds of theories on speed, perception, a nd the redesign of postwar cities - an aesthetic -mechanical discourse that had, of course, resonated with the van Ginekls when first positing the world's fair. Above all, Kepes sought to describe the discovery of fundamental organising elements in design work as a nece ssarily unselfconscious process. He argued: Some creative minds, those willing to face the industrial civilization and accept its premises, developed solutions to their own technical problems based on the artistic use of the module. This happened even though most of them seemed to have no conscious interest in modular logic. It was as if these artists had to absorb the basic techniques of the industrial world before they could develop a plastic technique that would be truly of their own time .... While painters and sculptors explored the problems in an imaginative realm, architects, engineers and planners attacked them on the practical level of concrete social dimension.... The standardization of building materials and mechanical equipment has stimulated the study of their structural and functional combinations, of the principles of symmetry and the mathematics of space packing.... 53 Kepes's book expanded his The New Landscape exhibi tion mounted at MIT in 1951. H aving taught at MIT in 1951, w hen the first wood strut geodesic was erected by his student Zane Yost, Fuller likely sa w The New Landscape . Another exhibition stemming from Kepes's book and sharing its title would travel to various art museums throughout the United States in 1958- 1959. (For an image of Yost's work, see: Robert Marks and R. Buckminster Fuller, The Dymaxion World of Buckminster Fuller [Garden City, NY: Anchor Books, 1973] , 187.) Kepes continued his project into the 1960s as edit or of the Vision + Value series issued by the publishers George Braziller, with titles including Structure in Art and Science (1965) and Module, Proportion, Symmetry, Rhythm (1966). See: Reinhold Martin, \"Crystal Balls\", ANY 17 (1997): 35 -39. 221 The contemporary approach to symmetry and proportion shows awareness of nature's methods of partitioning space.54 Modula r, standardisation , space packing : these were keywords for extrapolating lessons on architecture from natural phenomena. Accompanied by images of paintings by Piet Mondrian and Josef Albers, sculptures by Harry Bertoia and Max Bill, and a remarkable \"spac e structure study\" by the architect Konrad Wachsmann, Kepes culminated his synthetic description by juxtaposing a drawing of a polystyrola organism and a photogra ph of Fuller's octet truss (fig. 4.14). Here was evidence of organisational and structural principles - the properties triangulation - shared in both the natural and the built worlds. Moreover, nature provided not only examples of structure but, importantly, of space enclosure. The geometries evident in the polystyrola were further indication of the challenge to be mounted against Cartesian certainties of organising space - and society - inherited from the Modern Movement. 55 Just as in the combinations found in Fuller's experiments in close packing (Kepes's \"space packing\"), so in the polyvalent combinations of the hexagon lay a more \"open\" model for occupying space. Kepes's - and Fuller's - assumed ascendancy of \"industrial civilization\" was an argument against waste, whether aesthetic clutter or structural inefficiency. The ravages associated w ith previous industrial expansions were now to be countered by what Fuller 54 Gyorgy Kepes, The New Landscape of Art and Science (Chicago: Paul Theobald and Co., 1956) , 347, 352. Kepes made his remarks in a chapter devoted to \"Symmetry, Proportion, Module\". 55 When later contributing the article \"Conceptuality of Fundamental Structures\" to Kepes's Structure in Art and Science (1966), Fuller provide d illustrations replacing three -way, 90 -degree Cartesian organisation by his four-way, 60 -degree t etrahedral co -ordinate system. 222 called \"doing more with a less\", a conscious reversal of the Miesian dictum (\"less is more\") and aimed at countering Malthusian inevitabilities of resource scarcity. The apparent simplicity of the octet truss was to indicate as much. More importantly, this basic unit, itself derived from fundamental geometries, could be combined to produce geodesic shapes of ever-increasing lightness . Lindsay's engagement with Fuller lay in this b roader arc of experiment. Party to Fuller's intellectual exchanges and programme , Lindsay also sought a universal structural solution that could be thought as improving the demands of contemporary life. His own work was initially of a more technical nature. Building on results of the octet truss, Lindsay became instrumental to nascent research on the \"framing\" of domes. At the Institute of Design, he was credited with having built the first model of an applied geodesic structure (fig. 4.15). 56 Soon ther eafter, Lindsay began undertaking direct translation of Fuller's theories, thereby compleme nting those of Kepes and others, from pedagogical exercise to full-scale implementation, groundwork instrumental to his contribution at Expo 67. Upon returning home to Montreal in 1950, Lindsay immediately took to propagating Fuller's work. The Fuller Research Foundation had been created in 1946 to foster inventions and the development of patents. Lindsay established its Canadian Division, quickly realising a serie s of prototypical works: the first wood and plastic geodesic (1951); a similar but much larger structure for a barn outside Montreal (1954); a study with Fuller for a 250-foot diameter radio telescope (1954); and his \"Shell Truss\" Theatre (1955) in 56 Stanley Dodds, \"The Work of Jeff Lindsay\", The Canadian Architect (March 1957): 19. 223 Vancouv er (fig. 4.16).57 Yet it was Lindsay's earliest work that would provide immediate, perhaps irrevocable, proof of Fuller's theories and their spatio -material possibilities. The 8C270 Weatherbreak, built in Ste Anne-de -Bellevue, the westernmost suburb of Mo ntreal, was a 49 -foot diameter semi-spherical aluminium dome with plastic skin, erected by Lindsay and a team of six untrained assistants in eight hours, and moved to its site by ten men on a winter's day in December 1950 (fig. 4.17).58 It was the very first large -size tube and skin geodesic structure. P hotographs presented two appreciable qualities of Fuller's mandate; first, lightness, seen in views of only a few men carrying the structure; second, strength , shown by individuals climbing atop the dome. Echoing Fuller that the weight of building is the index to its performance, Architectural Forum breathlessly observed that the Weatherbreak's \"efficiency is as beautiful as its silhouette...\". 59 Form, material, and structure were united by an economy of appearance and of means. \"Look again\", promised the magazine, \"and you see Technology in building.\" 60 In its eclipse of architecture - or, as Architectural Forum put 57 Ibid., 22. Dodds de scribed Lindsay's patented \"shell truss\" as \"an almost perfect structural system, capable of being adapted to any geometric form, be it a plane, a hyperbolic saddle or a spherical section, and as a simple, logical and economical way to construct large buildings.\" The app reciation appeared in a special issue on \"Space Frame Systems\" devoted in part to Lindsay's work as well as to a geodesic dome built under Fuller's supervision by students at McGill University's School of Architecture in Montreal. Among th e student s co- ordinating Fuller's McGill seminar was Jerry Miller, who, with Ad\u00e8le Naud\u00e9, later contribute d the first and critical studies on the Expo 67 theme pavilion. Miller then served as the CCWE liaison to the theme buildings during construction. 58 The 49 -foot diameter dome provided 1,500 square feet of uninterrupted area. Lindsay's Montreal Weatherbreak had an orlon skin stretched insi de a framework of aluminium. Aluminium remained rationed in the United States ; hence Fuller's turn northward . Indeed, Fuller had conceived of domes specifically for Arctic installation, and his Radome structures were soon installed as part of the Distant Early Warning (DEW) Line, a system of radar station s along the polar circle and aimed to detect incoming Soviet bombers. 59 \"Geodesic Dome\", in Architectural Forum (August 1951): 145. 60 Ibid., 145. 224 it, in the realm that would follow now that \"Bucky Fuller 'starts the one architectural revol ution'\" - technology was endowed with the properties of and responsibilities for space - making. Proof positive of Fuller's ambitions, images of Lindsay's Weatherbreak circulated widely. Detailed reviews were written and the dome accompanied, largely unatt ributed, countless expos\u00e9s on Fuller's work.61 Yet it was its inclusion in Kepes's The New Landscape in Art and Science that signalled a newer and broader spatial-structural project emanating from geodesics research. Lindsay's dome appeared as a culminating image in The New Landscape , accompanying the closing article solicited by Kepes and written by Paul Weidlinger on \"Form in Engineering\". Weidlinger, a structural engineer , argued that the \"most urgent task of the engineering sciences may well be the creation of a comprehensive theory of design, i.e., a theory of form.\" 62 In keeping with Kepes's mandate, Weidlinger also turned to correlating technology and nature and art: ...the \"ability\" of Nature to produce manifold patterns serving a multitude of purpos es through the repetition of a single unit seems to be in line with modern economic concepts of our society. 61 Lindsay's efforts, including photographs of Weatherbreak as well as an 85- foot diameter wood strut and fiberglass skin dome built outside Montreal , appear fully attri buted Robert Marks, The Dymaxion World of Buckminster Fuller (Carbondale IL: Southern Illinois University Press, 1960). 62 Paul Weidlinger, \"Form in Engineering\", in Kepes, The New Landscape in Art and Science , 360. \"In this respect\", Weidlinger wrote in anticipating a \"comprehensive theory\" for engineering, \"advance in technology will be closely related to the contemporary arts\" - precisely the focus of Kepes's book. Weidlinger taught as MIT, as did Kepes. 225 If a redefinition of technological design criteria could be made possible (in a society of abundant resources), the resulting formal expression sh ould more nearly approach those forms of Nature.63 The model s of efficiency suggested by Weidlinger appeared in a closing spread : a photograph of soap bubbles as geometric clusters ; sketches of radiolaria (amoeboid protozoa that produce intricate mineral s keletons) from the German biologist, naturalist, and physician Ernst Haeckel's Report of the Scientific Results of the Voyage of H.M.S. Challenger (1887), whose rediscovered imagery had, in the 1950s, strongly influence d architects searching for models to support experiments like geodesics; a microscopic view of the triangulating structure of a rush pith; and, finally, Lindsay's Weatherbreak (fig. 4.18).64 The deliberate telescoping between micro- and macroscopic - from cells to geodesics - was precisely to visualise (\"redefine\") the \"technological design c riteria\" of the present moment. In other words, it was an argument against \"waste\": a society of material abundance could , when properly managed, convey its \"formal expression\" - architecture - resulting from an economy of means but affording a surplus of space. Weidlinger was already party to such experiment. In 1948, Progressive Architecture had identified him as the \"brilliant young engineer... in full charge of engineering development\" of Konrad Wachs mann's \"Mobilar hanger\", a project for an enormous space 63 Ibid., 363. 64 Weidlinger's images were contextualised by an extensive quotation, set in the margin, by the visionary Franco -American engineer Robert Le Ricolais. Le Ricolais was also studying \"pure\" tensile structures and would undertake remarkable studies on the application of topological deformation to space frames. Le Ricolais's excerpted comments originally appeared as \"Contribution to Space Structures\" in the North Carolina State College Student Publication of the School of Design 3 (Spring 1953). 226 frame - here, a steel skeletal double -layer grid - to house military aircraft.65 Wachsmann, an architect, was at the forefront of resear ch on industrialised building. I n 1941, he had collaborated wi th Walter Gropius and patented the Packaged House System, a solution to prefabrication based on standardised wood framing units and panels conne cted by a universal metal clip: \"Its assembly is so simple an operation that the only tool needed is a hammer\", wrote one critic .66 By 1945, he was advancing his \"mobilar\" concept, an attempt at achieving long -spans by combining a basic element - in this case steel tubes fitted with terminating \"eye plates\" and joined to one another by pins - into an assembly repeating ad infinitum (fig. 4.19). Commissioned by the United States Air Force, the work was to \"permit very possible combination of construction, geometrical system, building type and span, expressed in a flexible, anonymous design\" and \"be easy to dismount a t any time without waste of material\". 67 Taken to its extreme, the Mobilar concept - to build outward from a single joint - resulted in hangers of positively colossal dimension, with a floating lattice cantilevering 150 feet clear on either side from similarly -latticed pyramidal bearings. 65 \"Mobilar Structures\", Progressive Architect ure (March 1948); 90- 91. 66 Herman Herrey, \"Prefabrication System for Architects: Konrad Wachsmann and Walter Gropius produce The Packaged Building System\", New Pencil Points 4 (April 1943): 36. In an accompanying article, the American architectural histo rian Talbot Hamlin speculat ed: \"After the war, if we are to spread the advantages of the economy of prefabrication, I believe it must come through a greater stress on the prefabrication of typical panel systems\". \"In order to produce this desired effect\", Hamlin argued, \"some kind of generalized solution of the joint problem\" was cr ucial. See: Hamlin, \"The Architecture of the New Pencil Points 4 (April 1943): 65- 66. Wachsmann aimed at achieving this \"universal joint\". The Packaged House, an att empt at anticipati ng postwar housing needs, was to be developed by the General Panel Corporation, headquartered in New York and Los Angeles, which Wachsmann established with the financial backing of Wall Street bankers in 1942. W ith an investment of $6 million, the company existed for ten years but saw little success. See: Gilbert Herbert, The Dream of the Factory- Made House (Cambridge MA: The MIT Press, 1984). 67 Konrad Wachsmann, The Turning Point of Building (New York; Reinhold Publishing Corporation, 1961) , 170. 227 Fuller's geodesics and Wachsmann's \"mobilar\" dovetailed with burgeoning research and discourse on space frames. Three- dimensional structural skeletons , space frames were upheld as materialising the evidence of \"natural\" triangulat ion and its efficiencies - that is, maximal spanning or loading capacity with minimal material use. In advancing their respective building technologies, Fuller and Wachsmann saw the t otality the \"whole\" and the significance of its parts as reciprocal aspects of an integrated system.68 Yet they also differed: Wachsmann's thought was, in principle, grounded in tectonic detailing and in the rational fabrication and assembly of structural components (his admitted paradigmatic source being the Crystal Palace); Fuller's approach regarded construction as a special (and encompassing) interaction with nature, particularly where the specifics of this interaction could be defined in survival terms. 69 Nevertheless, both believed in a technological zeitgeist , especially given expanding postwar industrial production and the assumed ascendance of techno-scientific culture. As such, they maintained a late modernist faith in the imminence of a dematerialised world in which art, science, and technology were inextric ably interwoven.70 Indeed, in the expanded discourse on space frames - the same one in which Lindsay's Weatherbreak would endlessly circulate - what mattered were not always the literal aspects of technical achievement but the phenomenal ones. Commenting on his aircraft hangers, Wachsmann could conclude: \"Quite indirectly, almost like by -product, there merged, at last, 68 Herbert, The Dream of the Factory- Made House , 7. 69 Kenneth Frampton, The Technocrats of the Wachsmann 542-543 (January -February 1988): 119. 70 Ibid., 120. 228 a structure capable of communicating a perfectly new spatial experience by technological means, while simultaneously expressing ideas of th e conquest of mass and free dynamic space on a scale previously unknown.\"71 \"At last\": here was promise of a new aesthetic born of the culmination of theoretical research. Evocatively photographed by his wife Anna, Wachsmann's models (and they were to rem ain as models) suggest ed just what the \"new landscape\" might look like. In space frames lay an \"alternate\" trajectory of modern architecture , but with a no less prophetic and universalising mission. To enthusiasts, space frames - inexpensive, easy to produce, and structurally efficient - were an argument against an arid functionalism; this was the gist of Wachsmann's promised \"new spatial experience by technological means\". Thus when Architectural Forum editor Douglas Haskell looked into his \"crystal ba ll\" in 1951, he divined that space frames would not only lead toward \"a new order of construction\" but produce \"a vast new industrial creation\" - a future he projected a quarter century ahead, with the emblematic building of 1975 singularly illustrated by none other than Lindsay's Weatherbreak. 72 From 1951 to 1954, n o fewer than ten articles on space frames appeared in Forum alone.73 In early 1953, the magazine ask ed \"Is this Tomorrow's Structure?\" - a question answered in a lead article by the British stru ctural engineer Felix Samuely, who, 71 Wachsmann, The Turning of Building , 186. 72 D.H. [Douglas Haskell], \"The Crystal 73 Sarah Goldhagen, Louis Kahn's Situated Modernism (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2001) , 66. In describing Louis Kahn's interest in long -span struct ures, Goldhagen provides an overview of the American reception of space frames during the 1950s. 229 having designed the remarkable space frame roof over the Pavilion of Transport at the 1951 Festival of Britain, felt himself \"on the eve of a great revolution\": \"Hundreds of years hence, people will look back on this tim e as the one when construction changed over from 'plane' to 'space' and saw the birth of a new architecture.\" 74 From plane to space : Fuller had also prefigured this millenarian hope in his concept of \"ephemeralisation\", first articulated in 1950 and signa lling an already present \"epochal transformation\" in which the \"problem\" of \"industrialization\" was \"not one of countering the trend but of accelerating it exquisitely.\"75 Space frames and geodesics were seen as symptoms of this \"acceleration\", their very lightness addressing architectural, technological, and societal need and value . The theory of minimal material achieving maximal strength was seen as an entirely new aesthetic -spatial experience owing to the structural properties of \"growth\". Hence the lesson of biomorphic images upheld as guides towards design: the ready emphasis on visual evidence connecting the organic (nature) and human -made or inorganic (architecture) was a self-conscious project of naturalisation , of converting processes of nature in to works of 74 Felix Samuely, \"Is this Tomorrow's Structure?

Buckminster Fuller, \"Comprehensive Trans/formation: Arts Communication Environment 1 (1950): 18. 230 culture.76 The paradigm of self -organising \"wholes\" believed found in cellular structures was meant to inform the spatiality of building systems. As such, linking Haskell's \"new industrial creation\" and Samuely's move from \"'plane' to 'space'\" , space frames represented , to the likes of Fuller, Weidlinger, Wachsmann, and Lindsay, a critical argument on \"design\": to oppose any preordained aesthetic programme and to see social needs (again, against \"waste\") as commensur ate to technological innovation. Wachsmann took this to its extreme. In a stunning theoretical elaboration of what he termed \"dynamic structure\", he designed \"a single, universal structural element which, industrially produced... could be used in building construction for every conce ivable purpose\".77 Delineated , curiously enough, in perspective, the resulting work refused apparent distinction between horizontal and vertical members , with continuous strands intertwining and bifurcating to produce a seemingly infinite web (fig. 4.20).78 \"The unexpected and fantastical nature of this system\", Wachsmann declared, \"arises not from a preconceived idea, but from rational reflection.\"79 However \"rational \", it 76 Reinhold Martin, \"Naturalization, in Circles; Architecture, Science, Architecture\", in Philip Beesley and Sarah Bonnemaison, eds., On Growth and Form: Organic Architecture and Beyond (Halifax: TUNS Press, 2008) , 100-102. Martin argues that naturalisation \"can be understood as the process of converting works of culture into acts of nature\" (especially for the likes of Kepes and others) by \"constructing self -evidence, of legitimizing - not through argumentation, but through an epistemological sleight -of-hand\", in other words through the determined juxtaposition of organic and inorganic imagery according to shared formal attributes. Given their penchant for \"feedback\", the champions of this organicist project arguably also saw the conversion of acts of nature into works of culture - especially for any resulting representational value as architecture. 77 Konrad Wachsmann, The Turning Point of Building: Structure and Design (New York: Reinhold Publishing Corporation, 1961) , 194. 78 Not surprisingly, Wachsmann's perspective was included in Kepes's The New Landscape and immediately followed by Fuller's Tensegrity Mast. Wachsmann actually designed a connecting plate for the horizontal and vertical elements, but it appea red absent in his visionary drawings. 79 Konrad Wachsman, \"On Building in Our Time\" (1957), in Joan Ockman, ed., Architecture Culture 1943 - 1968: A Documentary Anthology (New York: Columbia Books on Architecture/Rizzoli, 1993) , 268. 231 became difficult to differentiate between structure and space. The effect was no longer to project hovering space frames, however heroic; it was, finally, to make them inhabitable. TETRAHEDRA As a work of technology and of enclosure, with a requisite aesthetic of lightness, the space frame was posited as harbinger of things to come. While at times fantastic, discourses on space frames filled architecture magazines and advanced through applied research in schools of design, notably by Fuller's itinerant experiments on geodesic domes with teams of students at MIT, Yale, North Carolina S tate College (a hotbed of advanced structures), and McGill (invited by Jerry Miller, who would later work with Ad\u00e8le Naud\u00e9 on Man and the Polar Regions and the Expo 67 master plan), among others. Konrad Wachsmann had , in fact, advanced his \"dynamic struct ure\" at the Chicago Institute of Design beginning in 1949 - precisely the moment of Jeff Lindsay's immersion there . The shared examples of Fuller and Wachsmann, whether in explicit research or the mediatic circulation of concepts, informed Lindsay 's contr ibution to Man the Producer. By the mid -1950s, Lindsay had emerged as budding expert on space frames in his own right. H is work and teaching began appea ring in architectural magazines. In 1957, he established Jeffrey Lindsay and Associates - Space Frames with offices in Montreal and Hollywood, California . While still influenced by Fuller, Lindsay started to subsume geodesic under the more generalised appellation of space frame - a conceptual shift signifying a desire 232 for a more \"open\" building system with multiple geometric permutat ions and spatial applications. Writing in the July 1957 issue of Arts & Architecture, the important Southern Californian magazine that had popularised the Case Study Houses and their aesthetic of \"light\" construction, Lindsay predicted: From the pattern now established, it is unlikely that Space Frames as such will ever be a division of architectural engineering. The trend is away from steel and concrete systems and towards the newer high speed techniques of the structural physicist, specifying natural configurations comprised of mass -produced components of few different types made from high performance alloys and plastics. The resulting constructions are astonishingly efficient, economical and architecturally valid. The majo r limitations of space frames are their anathema to planning and combination with other geometric systems. Everything is dominated by the form and character of the space frame. Specific products are now appearing, but the vital facility is the one which can process the unique case. It is not coincidence that Nervi, Candela, Fuller and myself have found it necessary to provide total services in order to build at all. Neither is it strange that even in a specialized field we also specialize, for nothing s hort of perfection will any longer compete effectively, and it is not given to man to frequently find himself a custodian of perfection. 80 On the one hand, the \"dominance\" of the space frame was its vital characteristic. Lindsay later realised such a work in the early 1960s at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, where a massive space frame covered the academic quad and extended to the surrounding faculty buildings designed by the leading Canadian architect Arthur Erickson, whose work would soon contribut e to the megastructure discourse (fig. 4.21). It functioned in a somewhat 80 Jeffrey Lindsay, \"S pace Frames and Structural Physics\", Arts & Architecture (July 1957): 18. Lindsay was teaching at the University of Southern California (USC), then a centre of thinking on expe rimental building technologies; the Arts & Architecture issue included his stud ents' work. In its issue of May 20, 1957, Life magazine published images of geodesics, including ones by Fuller, along with a space frame kite designed by Lindsay at USC. The kite, which borrowed from Alexander Graham Bell's turn-of-the-century experimen ts, showed how the space frame proposition - really, triangulated form - was, rhetorically, lighter than air. 233 typical manner, solely as a massive shelter. On the other hand, space frames promised something more, away from traditional notions of statics and toward presumably more theoretical speculations - \"high speed techniques\" - that could result in \"natural configurations\" (litmus of the \"perfection\" embodied by space frames). Here, again, technology - \"mass -produced components\" - was thought to mirror nature in creating an endless perm utation of forms from a few basic \"components\". It was with this background that Lindsay joined Expo 67. During the early planning of the fair, long before the individual pavilions were advanced, Lindsay was contacted by Blanche Lemco van Ginkel. Writing to Lindsay in May 1963, just before the formative Montebello conference, Lemco van Ginkel enclosed a copy of her speech at the PQAA convention in January, and reminded him of their discussion on Daniel van Ginkel's \"'concept' for an exhibition\". 81 Her letter was one of many to international colleagues so \"that they may press for a new kind of participation in their country as we do here\" - in other words, to lobby for the concept of large-scale theme pavilions in which all nations could participate. Lindsay quickly replied, acknowledging that \"there seems to be a case for a concise exhibition within one large dome.\" \"Properly presented\", he argued, \"the exhibitors will accept the concept of renting space in an environmental control. It will... psychologically enable the exhibits to be grouped as you suggest.\" 82 Lindsay's replacement of 81 Blanche van Ginkel, Letter to Jeffrey Lindsay (May 14, 1963), Van Ginkel Archive 27 -A21-02, Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal. 82 Jeffrey Lindsay, Letter to Blanche van Ginkel (May 19, 1963), Van Ginkel Archive 27- A21-02, Canadian Centre for Architecture. 234 \"architecture\" (or pavilion) by \"environmental control\" indicated just how much any notion on form, composition, or style, were to be obviated by what was, concurrently ar ising in Naud\u00e9's first concepts, a drive towards finding a flexible building \"system. His unprompted mention of \"dome\" suggested an aesthetic. With t his came Arcop's retention of Lindsay. The CCWE had requested Arcop for \"an unusual design of the struct ural system\". Several months later, the suggestion would be elevated to almost official policy with the CCWE openly calling for \"'cellular' construction\" - for all architectures anticipated at the future fair - as a \"'new direction' to the architects of the world\".83 The discourse now took on the cast of a zeitgeist , with a radically new kind of architecture demanded as necessary to the universalising mission of a world's fair. The polemic shaped Arcop partner Guy Desbarats's invitation to Lindsay to consider space frame solutions for Man the Producer and Man the Explorer. While in charge of the theme pavilions, Desbarats ultimately had little impact on the design; he would, however, be instrumental to retaining another key consultant: Janos Baracs, a Hung arian \u00e9migr\u00e9 engineer who had been designing hyperbolic paraboloid concrete structures in Montreal. 84 Desbarats expressed an interest in experimental geometries, likely following prevailing tendencies in architecture culture.85 Baracs had already been work ing on questions of \"geometrical avant - 83 \"'Cellular' Construction\", Expo Digest , Vol. 1, No. 20 (November 18, 1964): 1- 2. 84 Janos Baracs, interview with author (November 2 2, 2010), Montreal. Baracs fled Hungary after the 1956 revolution and arriv ed in Montreal the following year. He joined the local engineering firm Eskenazi de Stein & Associates specifically to pursue \"geometrical avant -garde\" designs. Baracs would enjoy a long career researching \"structural topology\" at Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al. 85 Ibid. 235 garde\" design and was especially interested in the close-packing of solids.86 There was an additional directive: a \"system\" flexible enough to respond to changing needs, since the pavilion was to be designed well befo re the exhibits could be determined. With these conditions in mind, Baracs produced two different sets of cardboard models: one of tetrahedrons defined by planes, another of tetrahedrons composed by edge members. The latter would ultimately be adopted. Invited by Desbarats to meet Baracs, Lindsay was immediately taken by the engineer's studies and borrowed the models to have them mass - produced in die -cut yellow cardboard. 87 These became the very same shapes that Lindsay would present to the Arcop team at his house in June 1964. The tetrahedral solution resulted from the CCWE's planning demands. The basic criteria for the \"building system\" were, the CCWE insisted, that it \"be of a temporary nature\", \"accommodate spans of over 100 feet\", \"form large volumes for exhibits\", \"be able to change its configuration during latter stages of working drawing production\", and \"be easily demountable\". 88 Published just before the CCWE's open call for \"'cellular' 86 Ibid. 87 Baracs's responsibilities included proposing a geometric concept, calculating stresses, and devising modes of fabrication and erection; see: Janos Baracs, \"Spatial Shaping Space: Exploring Polyhedra in Nature, Art, and the Geometrical Imagination (New York: Springer, 2013): 121. Baracs and Lindsay forge d a lasting friendship during the theme pavilions desig n. Their bond was shaped by a mutual interest in space frames, but also by Baracs's admiration of Lindsay's intuitive sense of structures. According to Baracs, \"Lindsay didn't have any degrees in architecture or engineering. He was an autodidact, but he was a great model -maker and well understood problems of connection .\" Baracs, interview with author, Montreal. 88 Thomas Ewing Blood, \"Theme Buildings/Expo '67\", Royal Architecture Institute of Canada Journal (October 1964): 58. Blood was the Arcop proje ct architect on the pavilions. 236 construction\", the first account of the theme pavilion design noted that the \"solution to the program\" was to discover a \"principle of devising a structural system based on a 'universal cell'... which might form walls, floors and roofs\". 89 As such, the \"truncated tetrahedron\" - notably an Archimedean solid - was \"o ne of the least complex forms\" that \"'nested' or 'filled space' in such a manner as to disclose two parallel planes\" and \"also suggests a structural system\". 90 In an official brochure accompanying the preliminary design of Man the Producer, the CCWE explai ned that the most important task was to \"accommodate exhibits, the size of which cannot be finalized until the building is underway\"; hence, again, the \"cellular nature capable of expansion and contraction without destroying the overall framework.\" 91 In ot her words, the pavilion had to anticipate changing programmes, contents, and users, even as it was being built. Baracs and Lindsay's studies leveraged the tetrahedral cell as a repeating unit. The purpose of the models was, simply, to allow the architects to play with them - thus intuitively to derive shapes, forms, and masses.92 The method, allowing for infinite recombination, was predicated on criteria set by the CCWE: the \"building system\" should \"be of a temporary nature\", \"accommodate spans over 100 feet\", \"form large volumes for exhibits\", \"be able to change its configuration during latter stages of working drawing 89 Ibid. 90 Ibid. The thirteen unique Archimedean solids are highly symmetric, semi -regular convex polyhedrons composed of two or more types of regular polygons meeting in identical vertices. 91 Canadian Corporation for the World Exhibition, Pavilion Architecture (Ottawa, 1965), 2. 92 Baracs, interview with author, Montreal . As Baracs recalls: \"When the models when presented to the CCWE and architects, people instinctively started to play with them.\" 237 production\", and \"be easily demountable\".93 Faced by the CCWE demands of temporariness, long spans, flexibility, and demountability, the \"solution to the program\" lay in discovering a \"principle of devising a structural system based on a 'universal cell' or 'building brick' which might form walls, floors and roofs\".94 By July 1964, Arcop prepared an internal report, \"Analysis of the Trunc ated Tetrahedron\", which provided a design: a unit cell\" with truncated apices that, when combined, \"can form walls and floor slabs\"; with this, the designers could \"recreate the form of the cell at a large scale\" achieving \"sound structure and maximum flexibility\". The truncated tetrahedron, cut at one-third of each edge dimension, nested to form two parallel planes; the truncated points formed smaller tetrahedrons, with the resulting surface creating a pattern of hexagons and triangles. The combination of tetrahedrons and truncated tetrahedrons defined both a module and a system for floors, roofs, and walls. The result was unlike what had hitherto been seen in space frames, which were typically horizontal. In the Expo 67 theme pavilions, the very same cell was both a constructional unit and something much larger - namely, a building (fig. 4.22). Once subdivided, the tetrahedron would yield triangular and hexagonal levels that by being \"combined\" (with shared floor plates), \"connected\" (joined by projecting walkways), or a \"combination of both\", could allow \"connected Ibid. 238 combined intermediate spaces\", and \"by removing walls... large spaces\".95 While the concern for connection and combination was structural and geometrical, there also appeared a remarkable spatial quality. Lindsay replaced the original cardboard models by tetrahedrons made of injection -moulded clear acrylic fitted with snaps that, when built up, showed both overall massings and specific conditions like the intersections of walls and structural piers (fig. 4.23). The combination and recombination of the plastic cells became the primary vehicle for design. 96 The models could be endlessly modified until achieving proper spatial and structura l fit - what Lindsay had, in a perfectly Fullerian moment, so early called \"perfection\". The acrylic studies were used at all stages during design and fabrication of the pavilions. 97 The \"genetics of the pavilion\", Lindsay observed, \"as finally realised w ere implicit in these cells.\"98 Once again, the pavilion parti was revealed in spatial terms not unlike the processes imagined at work in the magnified biomorphic imagery that had so sustained formative discourses on space frames. 95 -20-34, Fonds Arcop, Canadian Centre for Architecture , Montreal. 96 Thomas Ewing Blood, interview with author (July 7, 2011) , Ottawa . 97 \"At all stages during development, design and fabrication of the buildings, models were found to be essential for proper visual assessment of the many problems associated with the structure.\" See: J.L. De Stein, Ralph Leibe, et al., \"Space Frame Exhibition Structures: The Design and Construction of Steel Space Frames for the Theme Pavilions at Expo '67, Montreal, Canada\", in R. M. Davies, ed., Space Structures (New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1966), 550. Following Baracs's formulation of the tetrahedron solution, Arcop would hire De Stein and Leibe as consulting engineers on the structural design of the theme pavilions. 98 Jeffrey Lindsay, \"Space Structure as a Preoccupation\", in Davies, ed., Space Structures , 950-951. 239 The tetrahedron manifested the aspiration for a universal system towards a pavilion. The \"need\" was \"for a disciplined yet versatile structural unit\".99 Its articulation was powerfully manifested a couple of months after Arcop's formative internal reports on the tetrahedrons, when the first view of the theme pavilion appeared on the cover the Journal of the Royal Architecture Institute of Canada (fig. 4.24). Floors, walls, ramps, voids, and structure - all formed from the same repeating unit - made evident the ambition to achieve a kind of \"total space\". Writing in an accompanying article, Thomas Ewing Blood, project architect on the pavilions, remarked that the \"unit should enable the development of open spaces where required, yet withdraw into a quiet grid in those areas where the structure should become the background to individual exhibits.\" 100 Here, devoid of exhibits, the \"quiet grid\" was writ large, an expansive honeycomb at once intimate and overwhelming, telescoping as it did from discernible units to endless patterned fields. It was a condition powerfully elaborated in a study model, one -sixth full size, which, photographed indifferent to scale, drew viewers deep into the lattice (fig. 4.25). Developed by Lindsay, the model served \"to demonstrate the potential of the sys tem and the space.\" 101 The impression was entirely that of Wachsmann's \"dynamic structure\", a space that appeared both structural and but almost immaterial. 99 Blood, Structure as a System\", Architecture Canada (April 1969): 26. 240 The resulting triangulated clusters jibed perfectly with the pavilions brief. As the tetrahedral design progressed, the CCWE published eight booklets to explain the Expo 67 theme and its respective \"Pavilion Architecture\". The covers carried versions of the same graphic motif: a single line from which additional vectors spread, split, or spiralled across the page, each terminating in arrowheads that presumably pointed to the multiple futures promised at Expo 67 (fig. 4.26). These lines of force, of organising \"Man and His World\", were equally to indicate the myriad routes and paths - the \"st orylines\" - presumed available in the labyrinthine quality already presupposed by the tetrahedral arrangements. \"The architectural expression\" of Man the Producer and Man the Explorer, the CCWE announced, \"is directly related to its geometry, and is a com bination of many forms possible due to the flexibility of the system.\" 102 The multiplication or division of the tetrahedron - as unit, as space frame, as building - was thus commensurate to both constructing and subdividing a theme - Man the Producer - by \" storylines\" - Resources for Man, Progress, Man in Control? - in turn parsed by \"chapters\" - others. The CCWE early insisted that \"Unlike the classical humanism of the Renaissance which concerned itself the fulfillment of the individual, contemporary humanism integrates all activities in the fields of science, culture and thought for the overall benefit of mankind.\" 103 Thus the CCWE's corresponding demand for \"Inter -relationship\" within themes, with a 102 Canadian Corporation for the World Exhibition, Pavilion Architecture , 3. 103 Canadian Corporation for the World Exhibition, The Theme Man and His World (Ottawa, 1965): 5. 241 \"conceptual design\" that \"recognizes the increasing inter -disciplinary aspects of all Man's activities; all crossroads shall be identified in all presentations where physically possible.\"104 Integration , inter -relation , inter -disciplinary : each form of synthesis was to be conveyed by the triangulated and hexagonated arrangements of the pavilions - a decidedly non-Cartesian scape that purposely gave oblique connections between themed areas, allowing larger demarcated zones but with multiple openings leading simultaneously to smaller exhibit spaces. Inside the pavilion were, then, interlinked \"worlds\". The tetrahedral arrangement allowed the parsing of the theme among \"a variety of spaces\" whi le working as \"a framework which can relate these and thus contribute to the expression of the story and its threads\". 105 The theme - Man the Producer, Man the Explorer - was thus organised and experienced by the multiplication or division of the same gover ning \"cell\". Arcop continued without direct knowledge of the exhibit contents. The architects were, after all, charged with providing a \"system\" that could change. Concurrently, a parallel process was underway to define what would actually be presented by the pavilions and how. First, consulting intellectuals and academics would write \"storylines\" for the pavilion; then, industrial designers could shape the exhibits. Arcop worked through series of cardboard models, their corrugation reflecting the tetrahedral geometries of the space frame. Easily manipulated, the models were taken to meetings with the exhibit designers and \"moved about in relation to the storylines and all the other political manipulations for an 104 Ibid. 105 Canadian Corporation for the World Exhibition, Pavilion Architecture , 2. 242 advantageous position.\"106 Yet with at least five exhibit designers contributing to Man the Producer, along with a host of consultants on the \"storylines\", Arcop faced the difficult task of continuously changing interior arrangement s and , therefore, the building form. The problem would preoccupy the architects throughout 1965. \"Change\" was, however, precisely the point. As Guntis Plesums, job captain on Man the Producer, observed following construction, \"Acceptable building volumes resulted from the natural tendency of the truncated tetrahedron s to regroup themselves into larger tetrahedrons, truncated tetrahedrons, or less regular shapes of the same family.\" 107 This \"system of growth would create a discipline in design.\" While \"multiplication of form... could have become an amorphous growth impos sible to control\", the \"limitations imposed by the larger discipline of tetrahedral volumes proved to be a blessing by exercising some restraint\". 108 Plesums's organicist analogy found the \"unit\" and its combinations as part of a \"family\" that could, almost willfully, \"multiply\" and therefore \"grow\". The resulting \"system\" was thus abstracted into a drawn \"discipline\" of intersecting triangles and hexagons rendered as a flattened but extended matrix, the sharp edges between the tessellated forms indicating ridges and valleys along which tetrahedral shapes of infinite variety were actually to emerge (fig. 4.27). The simultaneously planimetric and axomonmetric expression was to provide the organising geometries: for the Arcop team, \"Volumes were carved out of the 106 Guntis Plesums, Email correspondence with author (February 22, 2010). Plesums worked at Arcop as job captain on the construction of Man the Producer and Man the Explorer. 107 Plesums, \"Architecture and Structure as a System\", 24- 25, emphasis added. 108 Ibid., 30. 243 three -dimensional system of intersecting walls\".109 The work of extrapolating form from patterns of plane figures was, in Plesums view, uniquely suited to the architect: The architect in working with space structures must demonstrate thorough insight into the laws of geometry. This responsibility cannot be delegated to the engineer or fabricator, who are not equipped to recognize these intrinsic characteristics.110 Here was faint echo of a project, initiated by Kepes and others, for recognising - that is, visualising - in bio -organic patterns the innate properties of architectural design. The design was largely finalised by 1965. Construction was to begin in 1966. As the architects completed working drawing while continually adapting the models, one element remained clear: the space frames were to be of steel. The final system became a bolted assembly made of 3'-3\" lengths of bent six-inch -wide steel plates chords joined at gusset plates angled at 70 - and 110 -degrees, as dictated by the tetrahedral geo metry. 111 Diagonal bars separated the two parallel planes of the space frame at a depth of 5' -3\", the thickened web integrating all electrical and mechanical services (fig. 4.28). Even as certain exterior surfaces were finished in panels of stained cedar s hingles, the frames dominated. If the \"theme pavilion is a conscientious attempt to conceive architecture as a system for forming spaces\", Plesums wrote, then this affected \"almost every building 109 Ibid., 28. 110 Ibid., 33. 111 George F. Eber, \"Study of Expo '67 Building Materials, Systems and Techniques\" (March 1967): n.p., Box 39 -1999- 05-014, Fonds Gilles Gagnon, Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal. Prepared on the eve of Expo 67, the study was commissioned by the Canadian Department of Industry, a government ministry. Eber also served as local architect on Buckminster Fuller's geodesic dome for the United States pavilion. 244 component\" resulting in \" structure as the basis of architec tural expression \".112 The expressive power was immediate. In April 1966, as the storied Dominion Bridge Company, contracted to build the pavilions, began to bolt the first sections, entirely assembled in an on -site shop, to concrete pilings, observers saw arising giant frames criss -crossing over, slipping past, and disappearing behind one another - hollowed ziggurats, their canted faces seemingly meshed together and receding to an endless latticed world beyond. For all the typical precision of space frames, the effect was something altogether rougher, maybe even chaotic. Built of more or less standardised parts, the resulting assembly ultimately had to accommodate on -site modifications for structural loads by adding face plates to the webs. Yet the plates were all uniformly the maximum size, with excessive bolting even where not required. It was the result of achieving cost savings in the field as opposed to customising individual pieces in advance. With so many gusset plates blending together, the result was a dense mass of steel. This marked a crucial distinction between Man the Producer and Man the Explorer. Man the Explorer had some of its main exhibits known in advance, and site conditions did not require a close interdependence of spaces; it finally appeared as three similar forms with a central pedestrian plaza. Man the Producer was, however, designed as \"an integrated exhibit complex\" for \"three closely interrelated scientific sub -theme exhibits\" to be \"viewed in sequence or individually from a central 'interchange' area about 40 feet in the air\". 113 Combined with an unusual site - the pavilion 112 Plesums, \"Architecture and Structure as a System\", 30, emphasis added. 113 Ibid., 31. 245 was to hover over the fairground canals - the programmatic drive for integration produced an asymmetrical design. As such, the eccentric loads required face plates that, at times, obscured chord members (fig. 4.29). The unintended consequence was that \"the resulting structure approaches some of the very early studies\".114 While the dense structure belied the \"lightness\" expected of space frames, the excess m aterial suddenly gave rise to surprising spatial effects. Lindsay admitted, curiously enough, to the unintentional aesthetic. Despite an obvious enthusiasm for prismatic forms, Lindsay saw in Man the Producer \"a rudimentary appearance which successfully e nriches and disguises the pristine symmetry, usually the distinction of space structures\". 115 He passed his remark at the International Conference on Space Structures, held at the University of Surrey in England in June 1966. Addressing the theme \" Design: The Present \", Lindsay spoke of \"Space Structures as a Preoccupation\" and showed the Expo 67 theme pavilions, then under construction. While largely devoted to theoretical concerns, the conference also offered a lengthy excursus on \"Construction\" in which actual built examples of space frames were shown, including a further presentation on the theme pavilions by its engineers J.L. de Stein and Ralph Liebe. 116 Indeed, Expo 67 works - including Lindsay's timber space frame roof for Arthur Erickson's Man in the Community 114 Ibid., 33. 115 Lindsay, \"Space Structure as a Preoccupation\", 951. 116 Among it s many attendees, the conference also drew a handful of avant -garde engineers including David Emmerich, Robert Le Ricolais, Arthur Quarmby, and Z.S. Mazakowski as well as the likes of Yona Friedman, who, in a session on \"Design: The Future\", spoke on \"The Use of Three- dimensional Structures to Solving Certain Urban Problems\". 246 theme pavilion, and the Canadian engineer -entrepreneur D.G. Fentiman's aluminium \"triodetic\" structure used for both the Expo Place d'Acceuil and the Netherlands pavilions - were shown as immediate proof of a space frames zeitgeist , especially g iven the arrival of mass-produced technologies like the American Uni-strut system. Still, if technique and precision was the goal, then what of Lindsay's offhand comment? It rested on whether space frames were matters of technical or artistic concern. T o be sure, the synthetic project inherited by Lindsay and others from the likes of Fuller, Kepes, and Wachsmann, saw aesthetics and technics as one in the same, collapsed together in \"pristine symmetry\", with the quality of \"ephemeralisation\" as sole arbiter. Yet Lindsay hinted at something more, a kind of surplus aesthetic value that, in a way, granted greater symbolic purpose to the pavilion. Perhaps it was in this phenomenal effect, of completely enveloping visitors within its seven levels totalling 19 0,000 square feet, that Man the Producer could justifiably project its mission to normalise \"man\" - not necessarily with the appreciation of a novel architectural technics but by the unintended discovery of a \"world\" of shadow, of depth, of mystery . \"DUMB AUTHORITY \" In the late spring of 1967, the critic and historian of modern architecture Reyner Banham found himself, much to his chagrin, stuck in a queue. Standing among the crowds at Expo 67, as correspondent to the British cultural magazine New Society , Banham paused to think long and hard about the fate of his fellow visitors. \"When you think that this Expo is 247 officiall y subtitled ' La Terre des Hommes ,' and what fun they had with la Terre , dredging up artificial islands and lagoons and things all over the Saint Lawrence, it is astonishing how little they do w ith l'Homme.\"117 Toying with the Expo 67 theme , Banham quipped that La Terre des Hommes was hardly a paean to some supposed internationalism; rather, it was simply the culmination of a fifteen -month geotechnical operation in which 250 million tons of earth and gravel were shifted to form \u00cele Ste- H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and \u00cele Notre-Dame, the two fairground islands in the middle of the St Lawrence River. Banham's sarcasm stemmed from his belief that the cultural and spatial experiment at work in the exposition was largely incapable of resolving \"the $64,000 problem of all great exhibitions - l'homme, Mensch, folks, gente, us lot. \"118 Despite being \" viewed through the filters of stati stic and the lenses of rhetoric\", n otwithstanding being \"sentimentalised in tech nicolor and stereophonic sound\", and regardless of being \"hectored, directed and asked to respect the yellow line at the edge of the platform\", l'Homme \u00e0 l'Expo was largely w ritten out of the act - \" hardly anyon e has had the wit to put him on stage. \"119 Architecture, it seemed, was inadequate to its task of representation. Banham's misgivings pointed to a larger cultural crisis. Like almost all world's fairs before it, Expo 67 inevitably announced its modernity by its most visionary forms of architecture. Like the competitive celebration of commodities and the cultures they 117 Reyner Banham, \"L'Homme \u00e0 l'Expo\", New Society (1 June 1967): 813. 118 Ibid., 812. 119 Ibid. 248 embodied, these architectures crystalli sed an exposition's claim to symbolis e the civili sing processes of humankind. The van Ginkels' exhort ation to recall the colossal precedents of 1851, 1867, or 1889 was to harness the power of their modernity materialised in long-span structures simultaneously exhibiting advanced technics and a mass public. Yet this twinning, whether in 18 67 or 1967, inva riably revealed an internal tension. The architecture that was consciously articulated as mass -produced could not present a critique of the world in which it appeared - that is, along the symbolic realignment of geopolitical divides by a world's fair - without at the same time challenging its own right to existence.120 John Ruskin had thus railed against the influence of Joseph Paxton's Crystal Palace erected for the Great Exhibition of 1851: \" Must this little Europe , this corner of our globe, gilded with the blood of old battles, and grey with the temples of old pieties - this narrow piece of the world's pavement, worn down by so many pilgrims' feet, be utterly swept and garnished for the masque of the Future? \" 121 Ruskin anticipated that the rise of the mode rn nation-state would be necessarily emblematis ed by the most typical products of industrial culture - in this case a \"masque\", a performance, of ferro -vitreous construction. H is \"little Europe \" was , in fact, being irreversibly shaped by network s of glass -and-steel railway stations linking the spread of capital throughout the continent ( an expression of the very same Saint -Simonianism 120 Paul Greenhalgh makes this comparison regarding nineteenth -century mass -produced consum er objects (once known as \"design manufactures\") and their uneasy relation to industrialisation - that is, as craft objects designed in resistance to the homogenizing tendencies of commodity culture. See: Greenhalgh, Ephemeral , John Ruskin, of the Crystal Palace\" (1854), in Christopher et al., eds., Industrialisation and Culture, 1830 -1914 (London: The Open University Press, 1970) , 303. Ruskin penned his lament in light of the re -erection of the Crystal Palace at Sydenham in 1854. 249 undergirding the nineteenth century fairs) .122 Here, a new public sphere was, literally and figuratively, reflected in an ae sthetic of advanced technique. The set pieces of Expo 67 - Buckminster Fuller's geodesic dome for the United States, Frei Otto's tensile roof floating above the West German pavilion, or Moshe Safdie's Habitat 67 housing complex - exhibit ed the same condit ion. The experimental designs served as reminder that architecture achieved an intense form of means -ends rationalis ation within the spaces of world's fairs , owing to the demands of quick assembly, public exhibition, and removal from processes of everyday life. What, then, of a world's fair believed to project the future by modern architecture, circa 1967? Banham appeared at first unhopeful: The official view of the world's Establishment is about two jumps behind the human race. Ministers of culture, trade, information and other forms of glass - beads -for-the -Wogs have now arrived, mentally, at the late 19th century, and understand that great exhibitions are supposed to make major contributions to architecture. They therefore hand over the design of their pavilions to someone they understand to be a major architect - a knight in Britain, a professor in Venezuela or Germany, and so on - forgetting that the major contributions to architecture at great 19th century exhibitions were made, typically, by Eiffel (an engineer) and Paxton (a gardener). 123 The Crystal Palace had, of course, systematically arr ayed \"glass -beads -for-the -Wogs\". This was, after all, part of the imperial, \"civilising\" mission of its didactic displays - and construction . Nevertheless, a st ructure like the Crys tal Palace remained exceptional: its techniques of utilitarian assembly were not necessarily equivalent or reducible to end -product 122 Ruskin's romantic resistance to the railroad rested in his acu te awareness of its commoditis ing purpose: \"It transmutes a man from a traveller into a living parcel.\" See: John Ruskin, The Complete Works, vol. 8 (London: George Allen, 1903), 159. 123 Banham, \"L'Homme \u00e0 l'Expo\", 811. 250 processes of commodity production.124 In fact, the potentially re -combinable structure offered a system for indeterminate programs ; hence the van Ginkels' invocation of such precedents. In Banham's view Expo 67 could, then, only make its \"major contribution\" by presenting architectural work responsive to far more indefinite and open -ended needs than the typ ical desire for monumental display demanded by the fair's regime. In other words, architecture could reinsert \" Man\" into the \"World\" if, and only if, it had \"the wit to put him on stage\". The conceptual continuity sought in the colossal precedents of the nineteenth century was to project singularly massive architectural works capable of representing the world's fair as a large social body . Yet as opposed to the strict ordering of things and space - the ultimate classificatory function of Paxton's Crystal Palace or Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Le Play's Colis\u00e9e de Fer of 1867 - Banham sought effects that were altogether more informal. Any \" man-made feature of the landscape\" - a pavilion - would , Banham believed, have to operate along the lines of the ever -changing \" people -garden\" - the public spectacle of ad hoc queues - he had encountered and enjoyed at the fair : The only place where the human race was fully written into the act is in the most underrated, yet probably the best, building there - the Canadian theme pavilion \"L'Homme \u00e0 l'Oeuvre.\" Architected by the Affleck- Desbarats partnership (locals again) it is ... hum ... well ... like, try to imagine a cross between Piranesi, the Eiffel Tower, and the Fun Palace project. An incomprehensibly endless-seeming structure of rusting steel tetrahedra, rational but romantic. 125 While the pavilion was meant to exhibit humankind's mediation of the world by technology , 124 Frampton, \"Industrialization and the Crises in Architecture\", 49 -50. 125 Banham, \"L'Homme \u00e0 l'Expo,\", 813. 251 Banham did little to promote this thematic \"fix\". Instead, invoking the depths of Piranesi's Carceri and the theatrics of Cedric Price's Fun Palace, Banham emphasised a new kind of spatial experience revealed with in the seemingly infinite web : It has the dumb authority of a primitive industrial plant, and through it are threaded staircases and escalators, delivering the visitor to galleries and walks and platforms, on and from which he sees other visitors living, moving and having their being and vanishing from time to time into dark holes to view theme displays... and emerging, slightly to their surprise, on walks and galleries they didn't remember seeing before. It is so vast and three -dimensionally complex that in three visits I know I didn't visit every exhibit, work every gadget, walk every platform - it is an Expo in itself . And because it is so vast and complex, it swall ows queues before they form, and permits almost random circulation inside. 126 Banham appeared lost in space. Man the Producer had, indeed, been organised to enable moving through its three themed sections - \"Resources of Man\", \"Progress\", and \"Man in Contr ol?\" - without predetermined course. Raised above the ground, its multiple entrances arrived at a central \"interchange\" about 40 feet in the air, from which escalators, staircases, and stepped levels led towards the exhibits beyond. It was not only the a bsorption of his dreaded queues that impressed Banham; it was, really, the feeling that deep inside this \"incomprehensibly endless -seeming structure\" were found people \"living\" and \"moving\", \"vanishing\" and \"emerging\". In this, Banham refused to read the pavilion in terms of its actual function (fig. 4.30). Consciously disentangling visitors from the exhibits they supposedly saw and presumably enjoyed, Banham described instead an environment that favoured the itinerant and, accordingly, the fluid interactions between people themselves. 126 Ibid., emphasis added. 252 To stress circulation and its effects was to advance alternate criteria for shaping the built environment. Emphasis was placed on the temporariness of things, whether programmes or the arrangement of space. Banham's evoca tion of Cedric Price's Fun Palace of 1964 was a deliberate attempt to place Man the Producer in this context. The unrealised Fun Palace had been projected as a massive demountable space for ever -changing popular entertainment and education. \"The whole co mplex,\" Price wrote in 1965, \"in both the activity it enables and the resultant structure it provides, is in effect a short- term toy to enable people, for once, to use a building with the same degree of personal immediacy that they are forced normally to reserve for a limited range of traditional pleasures\".127 These \"traditional pleasures\" were, of course, social ; and the notion of a \"short -term toy\", as pavilion, jibed perfectly with the temporary - and festive - mandate of a world's fair. Yet, as Banham well knew, the Fun Palace was to be consistently modifiable, its \"kit of parts\" assemblies, gantry cranes, and technological interfaces providing for ceaseless adaptation as new needs and programmes arose. There was, then, a difference: Banham championed the Fun Palace as kind of \"machine\" because of what users could do to it; at Man the Producer, he celebrated only what visitors were doing - not necessarily by engaging machines or displays but, as he put it, simply by \"moving and having their being\". The somewhat existential line was odd given Banham's penchant for technology as saviour. Banham's knock at the \"Establishment\" circa 1967 rested on his recollection of 127 Cedric Price quoted in Nigel Whitely, Reyner Banham: Historian of the Immediate Future (Cambridge MA: The MIT Press, 2003), 214. 253 Eiffel and Paxton - a conscious distancing away from architecture and toward the productio n of autodidact inventor. In this, Banham hewed closely to his growing \"futurologist\" predilections, initially articulated at the start of the decade when, in closing Theory and Design in the First Machine Age , his revisionist history of modern architectu re, he appealed to the contemporary architect to \"discard his cultural load\" and \"run with technology\"; if not, then \"he may find that a technological culture has decided to go on without him.\"128 The seer of the Second Machine Age was, to Banham, none other than Fuller, given his \"foothold in the world of technology\". 129 His self -construed \"outsider\" status and technophilia - a \"boffin\" sensibility shaped equally by his experience as an engine fitter with the Bristol Aeroplane Company during the Second World War and a view of British high -technology before its general decline - were admirably served by upholding Fuller's concerns for the \"life cycle\" of buildings and their \"obsolescence\" (hallmark of any machine). Yet at Expo, Banham would admit to an unfulfilled promise. Man the Producer \"establishes the (admittedly very high) standard by which the US pavilion has failed\", Banham confessed. 130 While Fuller's remarkable geodesic was \"probably the best big dome he has ever done\", Banham dismissed its \"interna l circulation\", planned by the Cambridge Seven design group, as \"tight, linear and non -permissive (by the standards of L'Homme \u00e0 128 Reyner Banham, Theory and Design in the First Machine Age (1960; Cambridge MA: The MIT Press, 1981) , 329-330. 129 327. Banham, \"L'Homme \u00e0 l'Expo\", 813. 254 l'Ouevre, that is)\".131 In the permissive and n on-linear lay Banham's wish for a unique spatial experience when comparing Man th e Producer and the Fun Palace. Banham saw in the Fun Palace \"an entertainment kit that the non -institutionalised aspects of leisure can improvise upon\".132 Price had similarly thought it \"essential to eliminate unreal division between leisure time and work time\".133 Indeed, the Fun Palace and Expo 67 were contemporaneous to notions on a new \"leisure society\", believed ascendant by technological advance making human labour unnecessary. The result would, it was held, be not only an abundance of material goods but of personal time. In this, Banham betrayed his technological determinism. 134 His description of Man the Producer was simply a wilful reading of present conditions, as found at the pavilion, in terms of future aspirations - that is, what a \"liberated\" public would, in Banham's view, actually do once freed from the strictures of work, of \"production\". If there was a utopian quotient, then it was surely this: the assumption that Man the Producer could function as some form of \"social condenser\". The disc ourse that united theme pavilion and Fun Palace was contextualised in broader arguments for \"play\" (or leisure) as agent of cultural change . Indeed, the notion of homo ludens - a term invented in the late 1930s by Dutch historian John Huizinga to describe play as the wellspring of all 131 Ibid. 132 Reyner Banham quoted in Whitley Reyner Banham: Historian of the Immediate Future, 214. 133 Cedric Price quoted in Nigel Whitley Reyner Banham: Historian of the Immediate Future, 215. 134 In 1962, Banham had claim ed that technology was \"morally, socially and politically neutral\" - a view marking his technological determinism throughout the decade. S ee: Whitley Reyner Banham: Historian of the Immediate Future , 301. 255 cultures - held considerable currency in the 1960s. Dovetailing with broader questions on post-industrial society, the ludic powerfully informed the more fantastic megastructural ambitions, not only Yona Friedman's Spatial U rbanism, which had so influenced the earliest thinking on the theme pavilions, but especially the Dutch \"ex -artist\" Constant Nieuwenhuys's New Babylon and its vision of an infinitely networked future city with endless \"sectors\" meandering across the landsc ape or suspended over existing cities (fig. 4.31).135 Inside this \"enormous social space\", Constant declared, life \" would be essentially nomadic \".136 New Babylon grew from Constant's short -lived but influential involvement with the Situationist International, a group that had, since the mid -1950s, sought a behavioural reorientation towards the city . Guy Debord, the Situationists' intellectual nucleus, had formulated the d\u00e9rive as \"technique\" of , without a passageways\" - t hey led architecture away from \"emotionally moving forms\" and toward \"emotionally moving situations \".137 Well aware of Constant, who had lectured in 1964 a t the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London and contributed to Archigram 5, Banham's view of Man the Producer similarly evoked passa geways giving 135 In keeping with his commitment to the con struction of situations , Constant declared himself an \"ex- artist\" at the 1956 First World Conference of Free Artists. See: Simon Sadler, The Situationist City (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1998), 107. 136 Constant Nieuwenhuys, \"New Babylon: An Urbanism of the Future\", Architectural Design (June 1964): 305. 137 Guy Debord, \"Theory of the D\u00e9rive\" (1958) and \"Report on the Construction of Situations and on the International Situationist Tendency's Conditions of Organisation and Action\" (1957), in Ken Knabb, ed., Situationist International Anthology (Berkeley, CA: Bureau of Public Secrets, 1981), 50; 25, 22 -3. 256 onto passageways, a labyrinth as a dynamic conception of space.138 While sensing that playfulness was to be facilitated by the prosperity and technical advance of a Second Machine Age, Banham lessened his concern with architectural hardware by emphasising instead the experience created by an environment.139 The possibility of immersive , subjective, visceral exper ience , in Banham's phrasing, by a \"rational but romantic\" structure allowed architecture to be truly a medium of social exchange. Constant believed as much and thought New Babylon heir to the nineteenth-century utopian socialist Charles Fourier's phalanst\u00e8re , a building based on a desire for \" architecture unitaire \" - the Situationists called for a \"unitary urbanism\" - and designed for a self -contained community ned by \"passional into a superior passionnal quality\".140) Walter Benjamin had described the phalanst\u00e8re - in the context of related ferro-vitreous enviroments of the nineteenth century that he took from Giedion - in terms of the capacity of advanced building systems to change radically the processes of everyday life: Its highly complicated organisation is like a piece of machinery. The meshing of passions, the intricate interaction of the passions m\u00e9canistes with the passion 138 If Banham exhibited some sympathy for the Situationist line, then it was largely in terms of preparing quasi- utopian evocations of visionary architecture b ut without the gr oup's Marxist cultural critique . When reconsidering Man the Producer several years later, Banham described it as having \"nothing but alternative routes, to be selected at conscious will or simply at random - the Situationists' psycho- geographical drift.\" It was, Banham felt in hindsight, an \"improvised learning machine for Homo ludens\" - \"an accidental but instructive approximation\" of New Babylon. See: Reyner Banham, Megastructure: Urban Futures of the Recent Past (New York: Harper and Row, 1976), 116. 139 Whiteley, Reyner Banham: Historian of the Immediate Future, 215-216. 140 Debord, \"Report on the Construction of Situations and on the International Situationist Tendency's Conditi ons of Organisation and are primitive analogies to mach inery in the material of psychology. This human machinery produces the land of milk of honey, the primeval wish symbol that Fourier's utopia filled with new life.141 The \"intricate interaction\" of \"passions\" inside the phalanst\u00e8re was not unlike the social effects Banham wished to find within Man the Producer. The phalanst\u00e8re functioned, in fact, by empahsising circulation through the entire structure, with long \"rues -galleries\", or covered arcades, linking every wing and uniting new communal associations. Here, again, was echoed the promise of nineteenth -century precedents: simply, an architectural \"machine\" enabl ing the spectacle of \"humane machinery\" constructing \" the land of milk of honey\", otherwise utopia. RUST Soon after Expo 67 opened , the magazine Progressive Architecture retitled the world's fair: \"Man and His Space Frame\". Praising the many visionary structures, whether Fuller's geodesic dome or the surprising aluminium space frame of the Netherlands pavilion, the editors remained somewhat trou bled by Man the Producer, its heavy gusset plates hardly symbolising the expectation of lightweight forms. Nevertheless, the magazine concluded : \"It seems frivolous to judge the [theme] pavilions within the context of traditional architecture.... The pavilions set out to solve a complicated architectural problem unique to our time, which is probably more important than their meaning as 'architecture,' good or 141 Walter Benjamin, \"Paris, Capital of the Nineteenth Century\" (1935 ) in Peter ed., Reflections: York: Schocken Books, 1978) , 148. 258 bad.\"142 Placed outside the limits of architectural \"value\", the tetrahedra were made redolent of the epoch by virtue of their experiment. The mediatic reception of the pavilion made clear its exceptionalism. Architectural journals consistently disregarded the exhibits inside, focusing almost exclusively on patterns and spaces formed by the space frame s. Photographs appeared deliberately foreshortened, with triangles telescoping toward one another and layer upon layer of structure collapsing upon itself, as if mirrored or receding to infinity. Typical views started far within the pavilion, bounded on all sides by tetrahedra, and looking past a massive void - a canal, an atrium - beyond which other levels extended, revealing the entire structure raised off the ground, as if purposefully floating above the mundane world of the fairgrounds. The image accompanying Banham's New Society article was the same, showing people distantly immersed inside the tetrahedral world (fig. 4.32). Progressive Architecture made it extreme: the cover of its special issue on Expo 67 simply a high -contrast representation of a gusset plate node, beyond which lay only black, emptiness, a few slivers of white offering openings to other spaces elsewhere (fig. 4.33). Magazine layouts presented an ambiguity between inside and out, a reversal fully completed at night when Man the Pr oducer began glowing from within, its tetrahedra creating infinite triangular apertures, ghostly demarcating the pavilion against the dark sky. In these views, the tetrahedral behemoth appeared simply to dematerialise. To observers, Man the Producer, circulating widely in magazines, may well have 142 \"Space Frame Integration\", Progressive Architecture (June 1967): 144. 259 served as harbinger of things to come. It suggested, however partially, that architectures seen as only visions could perhaps be realised. Writing in the same year as Expo 67 for Perspecta , the influential Yale journal of architecture, in an issue devoted strictly to the architecture of the past two years, Peter Cook of Archigram summarised prevailing tendencies: [Yona] Friedman's scheme and the Japanese [Metabolist] scheme were more concerned with the opportunity of the multi-layer cage and the diagonal to respond to situations than to incarcerate events in flat, defined, boxes?\" 143 Cook's rhetorical question indicated how architecture was believed submitting to \"situations\", to demands made by works like New Babylon.144 In this socio -political statement, technics were critical: the evocation of a \"multi-layer cage\" was to favour steel structures - tensile and seemingly lightweight - over concrete, the medium of most megastructures achieved until then. 145 Yet the emphasis on steel also indicated how long - span structures - of Man the Producer, in New Babylon - were imagined ideally suited to the creation of transitory architecture with fantastic vistas and fecund space.146 Again, in the most utopian hopes, the technics were to engender, whether in homo ludens or homo faber , 143 Peter Cook, \"Some Notes the Archigram Syndrome\", Perspecta 11 (1967): 135. The Perspecta editors admitted how they had, around 1965, begun to pose the question , \"Where are we now in architecture?\" Sadler notes that Archigram \"attended Constant's 1964 ICA lecture in London, read his notes, and invited him to contribute to Archigram no. 5, the 'Metropolis' issue\" (133). 145 Canada made d efinitive contributions to concrete meg astructures during this period with Arthur Eri ckson's Simon Fraser University (1964), John Andrews's Scarborough College (1965), and A rcop's Place Bonaventure (1968). 146 Sadler, The Situationist City , 132. 260 new forms of social life. This was, of course, a long held modernist dream. As found at Expo 67, space frames not only represented, in the word s of Progressive Architecture, \"the search for economic means of spanning and enclosing large spaces\" but were \" social structures \".147 Long spans constructed this social scape - for a large public - by the immediate provision of massive shelter and enclosur e; but there was something more: the direct, visceral, collective experience of an unadorned but breathtakingly huge architecture. Giedion's influential reconsideration of the Crystal Palace as fundamental source - \"the possibilities dormant in modern ind ustrial civilization have never been, to my knowledge, so clearly expressed\"148 - found expression in Wachsmann's fantastic projects. The exemplary statement was Mies van der Rohe's unrealised 1953 Chicago Convention Hall, which collaged the body politic of the 1952 Republican National Convention under a soaring roof , 720-feet square, of massive 32 - foot deep girders ; the aim was to achieve an expansive and adaptable space capable of housing 50,000 people, what Mies called \"universal space\" (fig. 4.34).149 Man the Producer similarly worked as a display in itself. With fairgoers inhabiting and reading outward from the basic \"cell\" to the overall \"system\", the pavilion made evident both literal and phenomenal aspects of its own construction. Deep inside the tetrahedra was, then, conveyed 147 \"An Architect's Expo\", Progressive Architecture (June 1967): 127, emphasis added. 148 Sigfried Giedion, Space, Time and Architecture: The Growth of a New Tradition (Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press, 1956, third edition), 250. 149 Mies based the Convention Hall on his earlier 1942 project for a concert hall, which he rendered in a collage of coloured planes floating underneath a photogr aph of a massive trussed roof (which was, in fact, taken from Albert Kahn's 1937 Martin Assembly Building, an aircraft factory ). 261 the feeling of a technological sublime: it was a collective awe for the technological conquest of matter.150 It rested on the presumption that the space frames - and, by extension, the resulting megastructure itself - anticipated perfectly the technical needs and faculties of late modern society. By this collective, mass perception within and of the tetrahedra - as an utterly novel building system, space enclosure, and aesthetic - Man the Producer was seen as evidence of technological progress illustrating the exultant sense of human possibilities. 151 Yet as a statement on history, on its timeliness, Man the Producer may have seemed Janus - faced: originating in the prismatic - to Fuller, \"ephemeral\" - qualities of space frames, the ambition to achieve something sublime, of being overwhelmed by architecture, was, quite literally, materialised in the anachronistic quality of corrosion. *** From the start, the genealogical affiliations between the massive nineteenth -century world's fair architectures and Man the Producer were drawn to find in long -spans the capacities to fashion a new social compact. In a pavilion dedicated to \"production\", the space frames conjoined notions of structure and machine : the former, something custom-made fo r a specific purpose; the latter designed to be temporary and dynamic.152 The dialectic between 150 Leo Marx, The Machine in the Garden: Technology and the Pastoral Ideal in America (1964; Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000) , 197; David Nye, American Technological Sublime (Cam bridge MA; The MIT Press, 1994), xiv. Nye argues that, over time, \"the constant is not the technological sublime per se, it is the continual redeployment of the sublime itself\" - in other words, as expressed in new technologies as apotheosis of their age. 151 Marx, The Machine in the Garden: Technology and the Pastoral Ideal i n America , 230. 152 Howard P. Segal, Technological Utopianism in American Culture (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1985) , 12-13. 262 ferro-vitreous and tetrahedral - to leverage the past in the visions of the present, to find the present in suggestions of the past - was to dream of uniting aes thetic -technical and socio - spatial phenomena (as collectively beheld and experienced). Giedion's reading of the nineteenth -century world's fairs as truly modern was to believe in an original \"aesthetic response\", driven by innovations in iron construction and the temporary demands of world's fairs, in which \"a new poised equilibrium of all the parts of a structure began to appear\" - and, perhaps, to disappear , \"in the overcoming of gravity in apparently floating constructions\".153 Thus did the Crystal Palace, for all its prefabrication and serial production, have \"the impact of a fairy story\": \"Industry, after all the blight and disorder it had brought about, now displayed another and gentler side, aroused feelings that seemed only to belong to the world of dreams .\" 154 Quoting a German exile observing the 1851 exhibition, Giedion asked, \"Are there counterparts of the Crystal Palace among the paintings of the period - any paintings, that is, which give 'no idea of the actual size or distance involved,' and wher e 'all materiality blends into the atmosphere'? are none.\" 155 The romanticism implicit in Giedion's evocation was again consciously to evoke the sublime spatiality of an engineered work. Yet it was also uncanny echo of other exiles, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, who, when writing The Communist Manifesto in 1848 and trying to 153 Giedion, Space, Time and Architecture: The Growth of a New Tradition , 244, 247. 154 Ibid., 247. 155 Ibid., 252. Gied ion quoted Lothar Bucher, who spent ten years in exile in England after organising a tax revolt movement while serving as member of the National Assembly in Berlin. Originally close to leading socialists, Bucher eventually returned to Germany and became a trusted aide of Chancellor Otto von Bismark. 263 describe the ceaseless \"revolutionising of production\" and disturbance of all social conditions\", prophetically declared: \"All that is solid melts into air\". 156 For Marx and Engels, this was to be the \"sober\" realisation of the \"real conditions of life\". Sobriety came by recognising the materialisation of social and space relations; if this was a demystification of \"production\", then what of architectures resulting from industrialised means but effecting, as Giedion felt, \"to dematerialize landscape and dissolve it into infinity\"? 157 The answer lay in believing that, somehow, under certain conditions, industrialisation brought about a re -enchantment of th e social world.158 This was precisely Walter Benjamin's consideration of Fourier's Phalant\u00e8re - that underneath processes of systemic rationalisation lay a new \"dream world\" of mass culture.159 Hence Giedion's elevation of the Crystal Palace to \"the world of dreams\" achieved \"through the agency of transparent glass and iron structural member\";160 hence Banham's projection of Man the Producer to a ludic realm by virtue of its \"incomprehensibly endless -seeming structure of rusting steel tetrahedral\" ; hence Lindsa y's pleased conjunction of the \"prismatic\" and the \"rudimentary\" . 156 Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, \"The Communist Manifesto\" (1848), in Robert C. Tucker, ed., The Marx - Engels Reader (New York: W.W. Norton and Co., 1972). \"All that is solid melts into air,\" Marx and Engels proclaimed, \"all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses, his real conditions of life, and his relations with his kind.\" 157 Giedion, Space, Time and Architecture: The Growth of a New Tradition , 252. 158 Susan Buck -Morss, The Dialectics of Seeing: Walter Benjamin and the Arcades Project (Cam bridge MA: The MIT Press, 1989), 252-252. 159 Ibid., 254, 255. 160 Giedion, Space, Time and Architecture: The Growth of a New Tradition , 252. 264 In these almost hallucinatory readings was refusal to see Man the Producer as a pavilion - that is, as an institution in which the relations between individuals (visitors) and technologies (displays) were normalised. Yet it was also to believe that, in the endless exercise of modernity and its most consequent architecture, socially transformative experience could , in the end, only be achieved by the ongoing refinement of seemingly light, flexible, and sufficiently massive architectural technics. It was hardly surprising that such a fleeting utopia was found, if at all, in a \"world\" existing for just six, short months. 265 Chapter 5: Housing the World, 1 Little boxes on the hillside Little boxes made of ticky -tacky Little boxes on the hillside Little boxes all the same. Malvina Reynolds, \"Little Boxes\" (1962) From the beginning, Expo 67 was imagined to be a social experime nt. Its early ideal had been mass housing as a modernising force in the city. The van Ginkel's Man in the City took as paradigm the Berlin Interbau exhibition completed only a few years before their first theories on the world's fair . Housing w ould, it was hoped, serve as the conduit through which Canad a could engage international modern architecture by showcasing experiments collected from around the world . With the inevitable rejection of Man in the City by political expediency , the strategy became to conceive some kind of \"mega -pavilion\" inside which, as delineated in the Man in the Polar Regions study, the \"world\" could be organised. Despite their scalar and, indeed, programmatic differences, both proposals had a common purpose: as the Montebello conferees had decreed , to produce architecture communicating senses of global fraternity and technological progress . As opposed to narrow self -interest, architecture at Expo 67 was, above all, meant to transmit an idea of a universal \"good\". A s such, size mattered: whether housing exhibit or theme pavilion, any resulting project needed to be sufficiently massive and to engender new forms of social life. The residual but polemical effect of these twinned tendencies would appear in Habitat 67. Realised by th e young Montreal architect Moshe Safdie, this \"housing exhibit\" consecrated simultaneously the van Ginkels' earliest ambitions for the fair as well as the Montebello declaration that \"modern man\" must \"impose on the world of 1967 new 266 concepts of community life\" . First projected in autumn 1963, Habitat was realised against the cultural backdrop of pressing debates on suburb anisation and urban renewal , concerns central to Man in the City and at the root of Safdie's intellectual formation. It faced among the most pressing tasks of any world's fair: to resituate \"man\" in \"his world\" by rearranging the social and technological demands of domestic life in the modern city. As such, it became among the most celebrated works at Expo 67. Habitat 67 was intended as a theme pavilion . Yet it would be one without displays in the conventional sense ; instead, it was to be come a \"live\" demonstration of living in the city, offering the public an immediate functional value - as housing and as a permanent addition to the Mon treal cityscape - that rested on defining the thematic of \"man\" by the long-term nee d for shelter but a newer, late modern need for forms of flexibility , for \"change and growth \" in Team 10 phrasing , in everyday life . Discovering a novel architectural technics was crucial to this demand. Safdie base d his project on the prefabrication of a standard dwelling unit that, when combined with others, gave rise to a multi-storey terraced complex. In Safdie's parlan ce, which carefully sources , this was a \"cluster\" geometry: an \"additive\" process of combining units for \"growth and change\" would ensure that the \"identity\" of the individual familial dwelling was as important as an overall massing. Later, t he Expo 67 authorities would, at Safdie's suggestion, consciously present Habitat as incomplete. Elaborated as a special \"construction exhibition\" emphasising its erection by \"assembly line\" processes, Habitat 67 was seen as emerging from first principles: a novel spatial conception of housing, created instantaneously in an on-site 267 factory, and realised by a patron (namely, the State) outside the norms of the marketplace. The CCWE became, therefore, deeply invested in promoting Safdie's design by describing it as the most important \"prototype\" arising at the world's fair . Habitat was advanced as avatar of emerging tendencies toward \"cellular construction\" for which Expo 67 was, in turn, upheld as proving ground. As prototype, Safdie's building was to be a model worthy of imitation . Whi le this fulfilled the civilising mission of a world's fair, it also revealed a unique interpretation of visionary tendencies in modern architecture. Surely unbeknownst to most fairgoers, Habitat 67 was consciously imagined, both by its creator and its cri tics, as actualising some of the most radical aspirations of the 1960s. Safdie 's thinking owed to a unique ly influential source: Daniel van Ginkel, under whom Safdie developed his final-year design thesis at McGill University in 1961. The resulting \"High Density Modular Housing Systems\" project was informed by his mentor's immersion in the foundational debates of Team 10. 1 When invited by van Ginkel first to work on the Expo 67 master plan , Safdie insistently conceptualised (and then promoted) Habitat specifically in terms of his student project and the constellation of precedents that informed it. 2 The CCWE would, in turn, absorb 1 In his retrospective account of \"Megacity Montreal\", which included discussion of Safdie's student work in relation to Habita t 67, Reyner Banham insist ed that \"it is helpful to be able to see Mega -Montreal of the mid - sixties as a complete historical phenomenon, inclusive enough in its ramifications to cover, among other things, architectural education at McGill\". See: Banham, M egastructure: Urban Futures of the Recent Past (New York: Harper & Row, 1976), 105. 2 After graduating from McGill, Safdie joined Daniel and Blanche van Ginkel's office . In 1962, he left the van Ginkels to work for Louis Kahn. He stayed for approximatel y a year and contributed to the design of the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad. The invitation to return to Montreal came directly from van Ginkel: 268 Safdie's discourse as its own, championing the uses of prefabrication and techniques of industrialised building as panacea to the problems of the North American city - thus commensurate to the socio-technical ambitions of the fair itself. Barely two years separated Safdie's graduation from McGill and his initial work on Habitat 67. In this remarkably brief period, Habitat emerg ed as a uniquely personal synthesis of contemporary architecture discourse and social commentary. It followed the transformation of a student thesis into a general theory on housing that, in turn, became an ideal plan for the future North American city. At every stage, Safdie gave prognostic value to keywords (largely appropriated from architectural sources, especially Team 10) as fixing both the social and technical ethos of Habitat 67. This would have two kinds of discursive effects: first, the deliber ate use of Safdie's terminology by the CCWE to promote architecture - writ large as a housing exhibit - as the ultimate cultural signifier of the world's fair; second, the re-integration of Habitat 67 within currents of vision ary architecture in the 1960s. A TRIP At one point I wanted to go to India to supervise the college construction. Kahn wanted me to g o too, and then he changed his mind. That was the breaking point.... I had learned what I had to learn and had become restless. I suppose the restlessness was rooted in vanity, but also in impatience - an urge to come closer to the realization of my ideas . Then, out of the clear blue sky, Sandy van Ginkel showed up in Philadelphia. Montreal had just been chosen as the site of the 1967 major international exhibition... [and] van Ginkel was to be the deputy responsible for physical planning. Would I come and work with them on the master plan? I told Sandy I had some conditions: I should be able to take some time off to work on the housing system; I should be able to develop it within Expo; I needed ten thousand dollars to live on. He wrote back accepting. We packed up with two weeks' notice and went back to Montreal. That was August 1963. See: Safdie, Beyond Habitat (Cam bridge MA: The MIT Press, 1970), 62-63. 269 The intellectual underpinnings of Habitat 67 lay in Safdie's early evaluation of mass housing in the North American city and, in particular, in his typological reading of suburban development and urban renewal. It led directly to the design for h is student thesis - a work immediately circulating in architecture culture and, in turn, forming the basis of his approach to Habitat 67. Safdie' research on housing was initiated under the auspices of the Central Housing and Mortgage Corporation (CMHC). Created in 1945 as a Crown corporation to administer the 1944 National Housing Act, thus to run the housing policy of the Canadian government, CMHC became the machinery of postwar housing, starting first with mortgage financing and later acquiring expertise in community planning, architecture, and social welfare. 3 Following his fifth and penultimate year of architecture studies at McGill, Safdie joined a group of Canadian students on a five-week travelling scholarship granted by CMHC. V isiting projects in major North American cities, mainly American ones, with a broad range of urban and suburban examples, Safdie saw firsthand new approaches to both middle class and social housing, from Mies van der Rohe's Lafayette Park housing complex 3 Albert Rose, Canadian Housing Policies 1935 -1980 (Toronto: Butterworths, 1980), 19-20, 24, 29. T he core principle of the National Housing Act (NHA) of 1944 was mortgage financing of home ownership. The Canadian government provided 25 percent of the capital amount of an NHA mortgage at low interest rates, namely 3 percent. The direct form of subsid y immediately reshaped the postwar urban realm, not least with mass suburbanisation. With the swift rise in homeownership, it became apparent that the stimulating of home ownership could no longer be supported by government revenues. As a result, t he 195 4 NHA permit ted chartered banks to enter the mortgage field. CMHC was established by an act of parliament and report to a minister but are seen largely free from ceaseless government intervention. I n the immediate postwar decades, crown corporations were crucial to the provision of goods and services - transportation, resources development, or the arts - that private enterprise may not have undertaken. 270 in Detroit to Cabrin i Green in Chicago (fig. 5.1).4 The prefabrication of suburban homes - whether Levittown or the Eichler homes near San Francisco - were read alongside examples of historic city fabric (Georgetown, in Washington D.C., was especially impressive). Slum clearance schemes, a government administered undertaking critical to defining urban design as a discipline, shaped the itinerary. Safdie's culminating report, Housing in North America - 1960, outlined preoccupations that would define his coming thesis work a t McGill. He divided his ideas in two broad themes. In \"The Forces at Work\", Safdie looked at financial and economic considerations as wel l as government legislation such as zoning , which culminated in rumination s on \"The Building Industry\", \"Technology\", and the role of \"The Designer\". 5 This triangulation became a plea for industrialised building. While \"The Manufacturer\" was in a position to \"produce larger and larger components resulting in an integrated piece of construction\", he noted that despite the existence of \"the 'big -time' operator\" - \"the ver y large builders (Levitt)... even own lumber forests\" - most \"possibilities become chaos\": \"a prefabricated wall system that could give Levittown order is concealed behind wooden arches, cornices, and enta blatures.\" 6 \"It was very tragi c visiting, as Fuller puts it, ' The 4 Safdie's complete itinerary appears in his Housing in North America - 1960, Report Submitted to the C entral Mortgage and Housing Corporation (Mon treal: McGill University, 1960), 41-44. In addition to visiting housing projects, Safdie and his fellow students met with and interviewed architects, planners, builders, and other intelle ctuals involved with hou sing; a list appears in Safdie's report. 5 A very brief third section of the report was given to \"Observations on CMHC\". 6 Safdie, Housing in North America - 1960, Report Submitted to the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation , 18. To the roles of \"The Builder\" and \"The Manufacturer\", Safdie added \"Organized Labour\", which he blamed for opposing \"any innovation that reduced man hours in residential construction.\" \"Mass production and prefabrication,\" Safdie contended, \"have had short periods of attent ion but every time a forward step is 271 industry that industry missed'\", Safdie admitted.7 Yet two examples stood out: first, Levittown, which despite having \"conventional\" materials and details was notable because \"the process itself was modified\"; second, Fertighause, an Austrian project fina nced by the Marshall Plan that Safdie discovered when meetin g the Chicago bankers behind the scheme.8 made, Organized Labour puts its full pressure to suppress it\" (19). Safdie's indication of \"process\" at Levittown may have been the recognition that William Levitt had erected standard, detached houses (in different styles) at regular intervals along straight roads by dividing the construction process into 26 steps with materials supplied from a central warehouse. Levitt claimed to build a new house every fifteen minutes. Levittown came to play an important role in ar chitectural discourse in the late 1960s, particularly following the sociologist Herbert Gans's influential study The Levittowners: Ways of Life and Politics in a New Suburban Community (New York: Vintage Books, 1967), which would shape Robert Venturi and D enise Scott -Brown's \" Learning from Levittown\" architecture design studio given at Yale University in 1970 . 7 Safdie, Housing in North America - 1960, Report Submitted to the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation , 21. \"It is unfortunate that in travell ing through seven North American cities in the year 1960 we only saw two examples of partial industrialization of the building process in residential work, and no example that reflected our technological advances in material and process of the last decades . Visiting sites under construction only proved the statements on the pathetic way in which houses are put together. Even rapid examination showed how many man hours could be saved, how quality could be improved.\" 8 Safdie singled out one William K. Wit tausch, the Vice President of the First Federal Saving Bank of Chicago, as a \"lender\" committed to \"forward looking\" projects but also someone who \"outlines programmes for new schemes\". These included a prototype town house development in Chicago (that Safdie sketched and included in his report) of \"L -shaped houses forming an enclosed court the size of which varies with the number of bedrooms.\" Safdie tellingly declared, \"Urban renewal has made it possible to experiment with this revived form of housing.\" See: Safdie, Housing in North America - 1960, Report Submitted to the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation, 4, 31 -32. B y the mid -1960s, Wittausch be came a member of Housing Research at the Stanford Research Institute in Pasadena, California, where h e wrote Housing as a Consumer Product: An Emerging Industry (1966). In August 1966, Wittausch and Safdie appeared separately at the American Institute of Planners' conference on \"Optimum Environment with Man as the Measure\", held in Portland, Oregon. Safdie gave an address on Habitat 67 at the conference, where he also encountered for the first time Christopher Alexander: \"It was an unforgettable event; each of us had heard of the other and we were pleased to meet. That was the beginning of an intensive exchange, one which has been of significance to the development of my own thought and work.\" Safdie note d: \"There is an affinity between\" Alexander's \" patterns \", as developed in his Notes on the Synthesis of Form (1964), \"and the terms structures, as evol ved in our discussions in Philadelphia\", by which he meant the ideas developed by him and Anne Tyng while working for Louis Kahn, and which contributed fundamentally to the early thinking on Habitat 67. See: Safdie, Beyond Habitat, 154-155. For the Portl and conference, see: William R. Ewald, Jr., ed., Environment for Man: The Next Fifty Years (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1967). A year after the Portland conference, Safdie and Alexander jointly presented a paper at the 1967 Aspen Design Conference; see: Moshe Safdie and Christopher Alexander, \"Complete or Incomplete?\", in Reyner Banham, ed., The Aspen Papers: Twenty Years of Design Theory from the International Design Conference in Aspen ( London: Pall Mall Press, 1974), 191- 196. 272 At Fertighause, a \"one -metre module was adopted, and standard exterior partitions, interior partitions, roof trusses, and all storage furniture were developed\" along with a \"standard plumbing and electrical network\"; taken by the separati on of the house into components, Safdie believed the project would offer savings in construction time, u nit cost and, importantly, \"flexibility in plan arrangements within the given module\".9 \"This will become even more critical \", predicted Safdie, \"when the building industry starts to resemble the mass-production industries.\"10 While describing issues of fabrication, assembly, and field erection, Safdie outlined a second preoccupation : \"Forms of Housing\", which indicated what kinds of architectural types and, importantly, social ideals could be inspired by these processes . A \"'return to the city'\" - alread y instigated by \"urban renewal\" - could, he argued, revivif y the question of \"housing\". Safdie admiringly described and sketched several notable achievements, such as Hyde Park in Chicago, with its combination of town houses by Harry Weese and high rises by I.M Pei - projects that outwardly exhibited little on the ethic of mass production but otherwise fell within an increasingly familiar aesthetic of urban renewal. Yet Safdie's most important lessons were learned elsewhere - suburbia. Even if the \"large portion of the population has provided sociologist wit material for their studies\", the suburbs offered Safdie important concepts in spatial and formal organisation (to say nothing of the particular advances in prefabrication he had discovered there). As opposed to the 9 Safdie, Housi ng in North America - 1960, Report Submitted to the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation , 22. 10 Ibid., 24. Safdie quickly added that \"most single family residential work is not architect designed\". 273 \"prevailing pattern\" of such developments, Safdie sought unique \"projects that deviated from this pattern\", especially those that considered \"the amenities of the unit itself, its relationship to the immediate surroundings, and to the entire development.\"11 In particular, he celebrated Clarence Stein and Henry Wright's Chatham Village, a Pittsburgh garden suburb completed in 1936, which \" still not been surpassed as a statement towards an environment . The greatness of Chatham is that its form generates from a strong social idea, in which the planner has set the way of life of the occupants. \" 12 Followers of the garden city movement and members of the, Stein and Wright were, in the appraisal of Lewis Mumford, their ally and fellow member of the Regional Planning Association of America, the preeminent prewar - in other words, New Deal - \"architects and planners in the United States who approached architecture most consciously from the social side\".13 Safdie found in Chatham a similar nexus: the ne ed for \"form\", which owed to \"social idea\", was to produce the concept of \"group\". Chatham \"forces its inhabitant to live as a group because once out of their doorsteps they share everything\".14 \"It is the group that has identity\", Safdie concluded. \"It is an entire village that lives as a horizontal 'Unit\u00e9'.\"15 The invocation of Le Corbusier's 11 Ibid., 25. Safdie saw the typical suburban lay outs from the air: \"The lesson of an airplane trip: There is no better place to appreciate form and extent of Suburbia in cities than flying over one.\" 12 Ibid., 25-26; emphasis added. Safdie perhaps unwittingly replaced Le Corbusier's famed maxim vers un e architecture with the rubric of \"environment\". 13 Lewis Mumford, Roots of Contemporary American Architecture (New York: Grove Press, 1959) , 26. 14 Safdie, Housing in North America - 1960, Report Submitted to the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation , 26. A \"similar situation\" in \"another successful development\" in Deep River, Ontario, had detached units \"grouped around a common green which they all share.\" 15 Ibid. 274 paradigmatic Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation , first completed in Marseilles in 1952, surely inspired belief in a genuine \"social condenser\", a notion central to the imaginary o f the modernist avant- gardes, in which a fraternal order was to be developed within a single structure integrating private dwellings (of a repeating type) with any number of communal services. The antithesis of the North American suburb offered Safdie an e ntirely different kind of cultural image to incorporate in his vision of the \"group\". Th is owed, above all, to a belief in privacy as a social norm. Safdie concluded that families were \"moving to suburbia because there they found essentials to daily life which the city did not offer.\"16 These \"essentials\" were, in short order, \"the obvious factors of fresh air and cleanliness\" but also that \"their bungalows offer the m relative privacy\" as well as gardens .17 The individual house thus afforded a private rea lm both indoors and out-of -doors . Safdie accordingly imagined \"enclosed intimate common ground and the secluded private garden\" - an effort that could y ield \"a group of close houses\" that , in turn, would introduce a sense of \"variety\" in \"disti nguishing one group from the other.\" 18 The argument rested on his opposition to a 16 Moshe Safdie, \"A Case for City Living\", in Habitat (Ottawa: November -December 1961): 4. While Safdie's article collected the lessons of his CMHC tour, it also presented his thesis project as panacea for future urban housing. Safdie later recalled: \"I found two things going on in the United States and Canada: high -rise apartment construc tion, which seemed not to work for families, and suburbia, which also seemed not to work, though it offered amenities that people generally preferred when they had a choice.\" See: Safdie, Beyond Habitat , 52. 17 for City Living\", Habitat , 4. Safdie noted that the \"bungalow\" also gave its inhabitants \"a confused sense of identity.\" He added: \"It seems that the private outdoors are essential to the American family. This demand is an expression of their way of life and should not be ignored. Yet this privacy should not replace the community but complement it\" (27). 18 Safdie, Housing in North America - 1960, Report Submitted to the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation , 27. 275 report by the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada that had recommended a \"variety\" of house styles to counter \"homogeneity \" in suburban development . \"What is needed\", Safdie countered, \"is a variety of people who would generate a need for a variety of accommodation, which in turn will generate different unit types with different form which could combine into an environment.\"19 In other words, the concept ual viability of \"group\" was based on linking a social unit - the afore-mentioned ideal of the \"family\" - to an effective housing unit that could give rise to a new kind of city . A THESIS Safdie submitted his CMHC report just before initiating his sixth -year graduating the sis project at McGill. He turned, unsurprisingly, to the question of housing.20 The resulting work, defended in the spring of 1961, bore the somewhat cumbersome but decidedly didactic title \"A Case for City Living: A Study of Three Urban High Density Modu lar Housing Systems for Community Development\". Safdie based the work on the conclusions 19 Ibid., 27-28. Again, the question of \"variety\" followed Safdi e's sense of suburban house s: \"...most North Americans do get a single -family house, with few variations; the lot size is 60 feet by 100 feet, the site is rather less spectacular, and the floor area of the dwelling slightly more than one thousand square feet . Everything is done to preserve the 'Casa Loma' image. A space of ten to twelve feet is left between houses so that they are free-standing on their estates. Superficial ornament is applied so that each house is 'different' and has a 'custom -built' look . All this at the expense of privacy both indoors and outdoors....\" See: Moshe Safdie, \"Fallacies, Nostalgia -August 1961): 2. 20 Safdie had been exposed to housing problems in his penultimate year of architecture studies, when, under the guidance of Douglas Shadbolt, he design ed a public housing project for Vancouver. Safdie recalled Shadbolt's introduction to \"the problems of mass production and about the industrializing of the building industry\"; s ee: Safdie, Beyond Ha bitat, 52. Shadbolt became one of Safdie's thesis advisors and later, on Safdie's recommendation, consulted on the unrealised \"Man in the Community\" exhibition in Habitat 67. Shadbolt also joined the CCWE Advisory Committee on Architecture. 276 of his North American travels - that is, whether one could \"combine\" the potentially incommensurable valences of \"privacy\" and \"group\" into a \"common\" structure that had \"identity\" but was equally ma rked by formal \"variety\". The keywords overlapped with contemporaneous discourses in architecture culture in which Safdie saw his project as participating. In fact, he would carefully synthesise his CMHC research as the theoretical framework of his thesis when it began appearing in both avant -garde and professional architecture journals soon after his graduation. 21 This remarkable circulation of Safdie's ideas became a decisive prelude to the coming commission for Expo 67 . Safdie's thesis was a plea for the city. \"As our civilization becomes more urban\", he argued, \"one of the pressing requirements is for high density habitat.\"22 North American suburbs were marked by \"the sociological effect of separation of the dwelling, work, recreation and culture\" and, alarmingly, the \"city centre - the nucleus of our cultural activities - is in the process of disintegration.\" Invoking the edicts of functionalist town planning enshrined in The Athens Charter , the appraisal was partly a critique of modernist 21 Shortly after his graduation, Safdie published a trio of articles about housing in the CMHC journal Habitat . While b ased on his North American study trip, these were not travelogues but more theoretical, if not polemical, statements on housing in general. It is li kely that he wrote them while preparing his thesis and serve as explanatory text s of his design intent. See: Safdie, \"Fallacies, Nostalgia 1961); \"A City (Ottawa, November -Dece mber 1961), and \"The Master Plan: Growth, Change, and Repetition\" in Habitat (Ottawa, May -June 1962). Very soon after graduating from McGill, Safdie admitted that the \"travels in the USA and Canada... under the auspices of the CMHC grant for the study of ho using, have clearly demonstrated the need to imagine new forms of residential types of higher density and dedicated to family life, and situated in the heart of the city.\" See Moshe Safdie, densit\u00e9\", Architecture - B\u00e2timent- Construction (July 1961): 32, translation by author. 22 Safdie, \"A Case for City Living\", Habitat , 2. Safdie's argument was based on demographic projections: \"The population of this continent is expected to be more than doubled by the year 2,000. In Canada this rate will be exceeded and through natural increase and immigration, the population in the same peri od should rise to 40,000,000.\" 277 urbanism.23 Yet what may well have connected suburban development and functionalist town planning was, to Safdie, a shared interest in serialised production, especially the use of standardised elements. Nevertheless, Safdie argued a gainst any resulting repetitive urban organisation, whether Levittown or the \"park city\" associated with Le Corbusier.24 Thus reading across suburb and city, Safdie extrapolated key design criteria: 1 - To offer a certain variety of housing types, suitabl e for bachelor as well as multi-family uses, and that respond specifically to their needs and ways of living. 2 - To establish a community structure, hierarchically organised by groups, each with its own well-defined personality. 3 - To lend at the same ti me to the overall ensemble, despite its variety of housing types, a unity through constant massing 4 - To separate pedestrian and vehicular circulation, each adapting to a desired scale and place25 Here were potentially countervailing agendas: one the one hand, a programme attuned to different \"needs and ways of living\" that could still be reduced to \"well-definable\" - and \"hierarchically organised\" - \"groups\"; on the other hand, a plan to design a building that, despite being composed of \"a variety of hous ing types\", necessarily exhibited a \"constant massing\". 23 While CIAM town planning principles circulated widely in prewar arc hitecture culture, The Athens Charter was only published as an edited version by Le Corbusier in 1943. See: Le Corbusier, The Athens Charter (1943; New York: Grossman Publishers, 1973). 24 Safdie was also indebted to the \"park city\". When rendering the c lustered forms of his thesis project, he dre w perspectives - taken from the verdant expanse of a \"man -made park\" that \"interpenetrates the constructed spaces\" famous view of Ville Contemporaine. Safdie's sketches gave contour to the kinds of precedent with which he saw himself in dialogue. See: Safdie, A Case for City Living , final thesis presentation boards ( 1961), n.p., Box 58/90/1, Moshe Safdie Archive, Canadian Architecture McGill d'habitation \u00e0 haute densit\u00e9\", 32, translation by author. 278 How, then, to accommodate the ever -shifting patterns of society - familial growth, demographic change, urban expansion - in an architectural work? Safdie's approach lay in his thesis title: Three sep arate urban systems were evolved, each with its distinct formal, social and structural qualities applicable to sites of varying topography and size. They are systems since they cease to be buildings. The study has shown that we cannot continue to think i n terms of buildings, rather in terms of large -scale three- dimensional \"subdivision\" of urban space. 26 The stated \"problem\" behind Systems A, B, and C was \"to establish a repetitive modular element\" that \"when combined results in several combinations and permutations of dwelling types\" (fig. 5.2). System A consisted of a skeleton frame rising from 10 to 30 storeys with \"prefabricated 'box' elements\" set inside and arranged in a \"repetitive spiral stack\" around a shaft containing services such as plumbing, heating, and electricity. One to four \"boxes\", each measuring 8 x 16 x 32 feet, were combined into eighteen different dwelling types; the pin-wheel formation provided a garden for every house. 27 The units would be \"prefabricated on the ground (poured in m etal forms and completely finished)\" and then \"lifted into position hydraulically in a manner similar to 'lift-slab' technique.\"28 System B was differentiated by the use of load -bearing concrete walls and slabs \"forming an egg -crate type space frame rising up to twenty -four storeys high.\"29 Seven dwelling types were offered, 26 Safdie, \"A Case for City Living\", Habitat , 5. The \"study\" in question was, of course, the thesis project . 27 Ibid. 28 Safdie, \"A Ca se for City Living\", Habitat , 5. 29 Ibid., 8. 279 most two -storeys high, with walls set back to allow for both private and public gardens. System C was \"primarily 'walk -up' accommodations\" with provision or precast \"box elements\" were \"grouped one on top of the other so that the resultant force is within the middle third and hence in equilibrium.\"30 This arrangement favoured symmetrical layouts; still, the \"basic cluster\" was to be \"combined with others in a variety of ways\" to form \"linear or space enclosing groups\" (fig. 5.3).31 While each system had a unique overall massing, Safdie made clear that fundamental idea lay in defining the characteristics of the \"box\". Safdie's concept of \"city l iving\" was thus derived from a single repeating idea. In presentation photographs, Safdie conspicuously juxtaposed his Systems models against unfinished skyscrapers rising in Montreal's nascent downtown core, which had only recently become irrevocably red efined by high -rise construction (fig. 5.4). 32 The self -conscious correspondence between the incomplete slabs and frames and the \"open\" massing of his three systems unambiguously indicated the ambition to generate \"a continuous cellular structure of the various functions which must be able to grow, to be added to, to expand within each cell.\"33 The biologic -organic metaphor, which Safdie would repeatedly echo when 30 Ibid., 9. 31 Ibid. 32 Other photographs showed the models of the three Systems registered against Mont Royal, the inescapable parkland backdrop of Montreal. 33 Safdie, \"The Master Plan: Growth, Change and Re petition\", Habitat , 3. The \"continuous cellular structure\" was a part of any number of \"minor entities\" that, taken together, formed \"an urban complex of great unity\". Among other buildings, Safdie his Place Ville Marie skyscraper . 280 translating his thesis into Habitat 67, suggested a built form without visual end or hierarchy . At the same time, the planned limitation of the dwelling unit assumed a design method based on fixing social and technical norms. This latter condition rested on a lesson learnt from what Safdie had called a \"horizontal Unit\u00e9\" (as discovered in Chatham Village) - that is, the need to articulate the basic \"dwelling unit\" as the means by which to valorise the status of the individual. In fact, as Safdie negotiated between unit and building, between domestic space and the city, the legacy of the Unit\u00e9 d'Ha bitation grew paramount. In a series of important conceptual sketches organised under the heading \"Towards a Module\", Safdie reproduced Le Corbusier's interlocking apartment type but with rotated levels (fig. 5.5). Safdie was indebted to, if not outright haunted by, Le Corbusier's famed image of a hand holding a \"cellule normalis\u00e9e et standardis\u00e9e\" and inserting it directly into a structural frame. 34 Le Corbusier had called it the \"'Bottle' and 'Bottlerack'\" method.35 Safdie's \"modular housing 34 Safdie recalled : \"An early drawing by Le Corbusier shows a frame and a hand putting a box into it and there are many recent studies of space frames with plug -in units\", by which Safdie likely meant the Plug -in City project Archigram, among others. He continued: \"It's the obvious, simple solution: put up a frame and plug things into it. It was the first thing I thought of doing in my thesis. It's also the obvious solution to mass producing, because structur e is separated from the shell of the house. You can consider the optimum structure separately and develop geometry for it, and then you can consider the optimum house.\" In terms of the eventual realisation of Habitat 67, however, this system was \"redundant\" because the \"frame\" required \"triangulation' to make it stiff, yet the \"units would give that stiffening in themselves if they were part of the structure\". Thus, the units of Habitat were, as in the System B of his thesis, load -bearing. See: Safdie: Beyond Habitat , 78-79. Safdie's exposure to Le Corbusier stemmed from several sources. As a student, he likely saw an exhibition on Le Corbusier held McGill University in December 1959 (and organised by Andr\u00e9 Blouin, a French expatriate architect who, im portantly, had worked for Auguste Perret in 1945). Safdie later admitted always recalling \"some moments in the years when I was a student, when I first saw Le Corbusier's early books and his 1920 sketches of a partment buildings with gardens\"; s ee: Beyond \"cellule normalis\u00e9e et standardis\u00e9e\" offered a model for Safdie's 281 systems\" ha d much in common with the approach, not least in a clear articulation of unit and frame (fig. 5.6). Nevertheless i n \"criticism of the Unit\u00e9\", Safdie concluded, \"it must be said that the dwellings tend to be tubes, that identity is sacrificed, and that the 'rue interieure' is not a 'rue' but a glorified corridor.\"36 A Case for City Living differed, therefore, from the Unit\u00e9 in one important respect: the concept of \"community development\" was not necessarily tied to realising \"a complete entity in itself\" - that is, hiding the repeating cell within a larger whole (with the implied sense of monasticism); rather, it rested on providing a plastic form that outwardly exhibited the living units - thus expressing the individuality, the identity , of the inhabitants. Still, Le Corbusier served as interlocutor and foil. T hrough him, Safdie would continuously reappraise (and justify) his own design choices. In a curious historical twist, Le Corbusier had actually described the Unit\u00e9 as a \"vertical garden city\". 37 Earlier, while defining the Ville Radiuese and following his procla mation, \"To Live! (To Breathe)\" - Le thesis project : \"The apartment at Marseilles is a complete entity in itself completely unconcerned with the ground or with foundations. It can be placed in the middle of a building which has a skeleton of reinforced concrete. This has led to the terms \"Bottle\" and \"Bot tlerack\" for this construction which was applied at the Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation at Marseilles. Some day the components of the bottles will be made entirely in the workshops, and will be assembled on the site, each apartment complete, being hoisted into position one at a time.\" 36 Safdie, \"A Case for City Living\", Habitat ,, 3, emphasis added. Safdie decided that \"In Le Corbusier's later work, as realized in the Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation, we find many of the early ideas \" - likely the two -storey dwelling unit with a \" jardin suspendu \" first formulated for the Immeubles Villas apartments of 1922, or the 14 square - metre \"biological unit\" designed for the Ville Radieuse in the early 1930s - \"either abandoned or sacrificed.\" 37 Le Corbusier, Looking at City Planning , trans. o f Maniere de Penser l'Urbanisme (1946) by Eleanor Levieux (New Y ork: Grossman Publishers, 1971), 48. As Kenneth Frampton notes, Le Corbusier \"was in categoric opposition to the horizontal, low -rise Anglo -Saxon garden city commonly adopted elsewhere for expansion on the urban periphery\". See: Frampton, Le Corbusier (London: Thames and Hudson, 2001), 156. Nevertheless, Le Corbusier adopt ed aspects of garden city planning in his master plan for Chandigarh . 282 Corbusier had declared: \"Suburbs must be eliminated and nature brought back into the cities themselves.\"38 The idea drew on the twelve -storey dwelling blocks for the Ville Contemporaine of 1922; its or 'honeycomb' gardens'\" and open -air mezzanines that afforded intima te communion with the outdoors .39 Safdie was beholden to the plan. I n a sketchbook pr epared to frame the basic ideas (including precedents) guiding his thesis, he carefully redrew Le Corbusier's view from a \"jardin suspendu \" in a typical Immeuble Villa apartment inside the Ville Contemporaine (fig. 5.7).40 Le Corbusier's sketch expressed h is eventual conclusion that \"Architecture, city planning, our happiness, the state of our consciousness, the equilibrium of our individual lives, the rhythm of our collective duties are all governed by the 24-hour cycle of the sun .\"41 Safdie made his case along similar lines. In the pin -wheeling arrangement of System A, the \"sun penetrates through the structure to dwellings on the north side\"; \"each dwelling has its own private outdoor garden, which is two storeys high and opens through to the air and sun\". 42 Similarly in System B, \"four dwellings on each level share one communal roofed 38 Le Corbusier, The Radiant City , trans. of La Ville Radieuse (1935) by Pamela Knight (London: Faber, 1967), 104. 39 Le Corbusier, The City of Tomorrow , trans. of Urbanisme (1924) by Frederick Etchells (Cambridge MA: The MIT Press, 1971) , 224-225. 40 Safdie signed his sketch \"M.S. (after L.C.)\". Safdie's concepts were developed in the many sketchbooks he kept during his student thesis. The sketchbooks were organised as a running commentary with his advisors, including Daniel van Ginkel , that recorded the architectural precedents and design theories that he was either appropriating or challenging. 41 Le Corbusier, The Radiant City , 104. Le Corbusier consistently imagined views of a verdant expanse as seen from a balcony, mezzanine, or through a fen\u00eatre en longueur (one of his important \"5 Points of a New City Living\", Habitat , 7. 283 garden (in addition and separate from the private ones)\".43 In a sense, the descriptions followed a long -standing quest for salubrity as necessary to modern life. The disco urse had defined CIAM functionalism and continued to inform postwar urban renewal - namely, slum clearance - schemes. Despite having firsthand knowledge of such efforts under the auspices of CMHC, Safdie reaction to the existing city never adopted the ter ms of combating overcrowding, disease, or social chaos. He did not see the city in the same apocalyptic terms that had animated the modern movement. Instead, he remained committed to reconceiving the needs of a postwar and newly prosperous middle class. In trying to define the concept of the \"working unit\" , Safdie turned not only to the technical and spatial experiment of the Unit\u00e9 but also to Le Corbusier's attempt at imagin ing an ideal social paradigm in architectur e. For Le Corbusier this stemmed from his admiration of the nineteenth -century utopian socialist Charles Fourier's phalanst\u00e8re and the spontaneous fraternal order imagined arising inside this massive building for 1,600 inhabitants.44 The Unit\u00e9 was similarly to serve as a kind of city -in-minia ture with the provision of a two internal \"streets\" lined with shopping, a nursery school, and a roof deck housing a 43 Ibid. System C was not described in terms of public and private outdoor space. It was designed more from the point of view of providing \"'walk -up' accommodation\", which Safdie had identified as important during his CMHC travels. 44 Le Corbusier unequivocally declared: \"And yet great city planners have gone before, but they wielded ideas, not pencils - Balzac, Fourier, Consid\u00e9rant, Proudhon....\" See: Le Corbusier, Looking at City Planning , 2. Neither Fourier nor Le Corbusier had advocated the abolition of private property. Safdie shared this view, especially given his appreciation of suburbia; at the s ame time, he argue d for statist intervention in housing. Safdie's clear articulation of each \"housing unit\" in his drawings indicated a commitment to maintaining the norms of domestic private property. For a detailed discussion of the impact of Fourier's ideas on Le Corbusier, see: Peter Serenyi, \"Le Corbusier, and the Monastery of Ema\" (1967), in Le Corbusier in Perspective (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice -Hall, Inc., 1975), 103-116. 284 gymnasium, a paddling pool for infants, and an al fresco theatre space. Safdie also envisaged his Systems animated by \"a network of public gardens\" as well as \"schools and nurseries\" on the roofs while \"shops and other facilities\" would spread around the base .45 Safdie's sympathetic echo of Le Corbusier's expression of collectivisation likely stemmed from a personal source - his deep philosophical debt to the Israeli kibbutz system in which he had been immersed when young: \"an open -ended, civilized\", and \"much more human Marxism\" , Safdie recalled, and decidedly \"not bureaucratic socialism\".46 The desire for some form of co-operative society underpinned his thesis programme: In the past, man has always organised into social groups with a communal structure. This can no longer be disregarded as it was in recent years, when one is dealing with a large concentration of people sharing many facilities. Groups must be formed - the family; a group of families forms a working unit; several units form a 45 Safdie, \"A Case for City Living\", Habitat , 7. 46 Safdie, Beyond Habitat , 50. The kibbutz movements, which arose mainly in the 1920s, were largely secular, agricultural settlements based on co -ownership; in this, they reflected the anarcho -communitarian ideas of Peter Kropotkin, especially the notion that decentr alised communities require d certain infrastructural bases, such as the distribution of electricity. Soon after completing Habitat 67, Safdie recalled: \"the ideal of us as children was when we were 18, we would leave home and after the Army would start our own kibbutz so that the kibbutz is constantly our social goal as a way of life... all my social thinking was in terms of that kind of a life.\" See: Moshe Safdie, \"First Reel, Last Portion\", Interview 24, 1968): 18- 19, Box PF22, Moshe Safdie Archive, Canadian Architecture Collection, McGill University, Montreal. Safdie was, in fact, aware of Israeli efforts in mass housing. When providing the CCWE with a list of ten projects similar to Habitat , he included three works from Israel that outwardly shared his \"pyramid -shaped\" preoccupations , including Leopold Gerstel's Ziggurat urban housing experiment of 1963 . See: \"Examples of Residential Design Projects Having a Character Similar to that of Habitat '67\" (September 24, 1964): 1- 2, Canadi an Corporation for the World Exhibition Fonds, RG71, Vol. 445, Library and Archives Canada, Ottawa. Safdie otherwise remained cool toward inherited ideas of architectural utopias. He saw something like Le Corbusier's Ville Radieuse as \"objectionable\" sinc e \"it was conceived as a city built in one day\"; moreover, \"we are terrified by the great 'utopian' plans of our time\" because \"we refuse in western culture to accept the taste of one man on an urban scale.\" Safdie resisted any planning where space relati ons were fixed a priori - in other words, any design that did not account for \"predetermining change in an existing environment\", which \"implies the need for flexibility.\" See: Plan: Change and Repetition\", Habitat , 3- 4. 285 community; communities form urban clusters. Every level of social organization must be a physical phenomenon; it must have identity.47 Safdie's rediscovery of a need for \"communal structure\" in the 1960s was, notwithstanding his kibbutzim sympathies , necessarily tempered by his acute awareness of public and private life in North America. 48 He faced, therefore, the problem of how to b alance the concept of a \"working unit\" between its signification of a hermetically -sealed entity and its basis as a more \"open \" social structure. If \"every level of social organization\" was to be \"a physical phenomenon\", then \"one standard repetitive mass -produced element\" could, in principle, lead from housing a family to a society, from the dwelling to the city. While \"change\", \"growth\", and \"flexibility\" derived from notions on \"choice\", thereby establishing a social ideal when approaching the built environment, Safdie also tied his concepts to a more technical base. He believed that a manufactured dwelling unit could result from the rationalising capacities of industry to retool as needs and demands (or, as he put it, \"values and means\") continuously changed. \"Projects should attempt to solve the aesthetic problems that result through standardization of constructional elements\", he asserted. While Safdie did not develop his thesis by providing specific details of plant or assembly - soon crucial to Habitat 67 - he did offer a schematic outline of construction in sketches that describe casting of units, installation of prefabricated components, and erection by a \"lift -slab\" technique (fig. 5.8). As such, when unenc umbered by matters of programme, 47 Safdie, \"Fallacies, Nostalgia and Reality\", in Habitat, 7. 48 In summarising the early conclusions of his thesis, Safdie noted that System A affords \"extreme privacy\" while Systems B and C granted \"privacy\". See: Safdie, \"Development\" Sketchbook P (1960), Mo she Safdie Archive, Canadian Architecture Collection, McGill University, Montreal. 286 this was really a hypothesis on building as process . Safdie thus calibrated his polemic on \"growth\" to a specific style of drawing: axonometric projection. Every dwelling type as well as the \"basic repetitive grouping\" of each System resulted from a box \"superimposed\" in a series of configura tions always drawn on a 30 \u00b0 axis. The use of axonometric allowed A Case for City Living to be seen in close-up: the geometric emphasis - that is, an objective view of the world, with precision of measurement and perspectival disambiguation - was to confer the appearance of technical expertise. This followed in cleverly framed and cropped photographs of architectural models, with compositions often reproducing the orthographic view. 49 In both cases, drawing and photograph, the axonometric allowed reading outward from a box, its combinations, and the actual occupation of the city.50 The careful photographic juxtaposition of models against the Montreal skyline served to situate A Case for City Living within a realistic and desirable setting. The images also pointed to a peculiarly utopian aspect of the three Systems. This was, above all, to fix the future (a social paradigm) in the terms of the present (by way of existing building technologies). It depended upon leveraging k nown means of production (again, industrialised building) to enable novel form s of social organisation and well -being. 49 Safdie's considerable effort at cropping photographs to shape another quasi -axonometric view was a way to suggest the \"unheroic\" aspect of his project - the photographs a ppeared largely without the perspectival vastness common to architectural representation. As the architectural Robin Evans notes, \"while perspective may still be lauded as the great opener of Western eyes, orthographic projection is relegated to the statu s of a technical matter: technical drawing; limited vision.\" See: Evans, \"Architectural Projection\", in Architecture & its Image (Montreal: Canadian Centre for Architecture, 1989), 24. 50 Addressing \"a hypothetical site with Montreal characteristics\", Sys tems A, B, and C used the density of Westmont, a wealthy town immediately adjacent to Montreal, to define an ideal \"sector of 30,000 inhabitants\"; see: Safdie, A Case for City Living, final t hesis presentation boards, n.p . 287 Thus, the quest for \"flexibility\" was tied not only to the necessary limits of \"standardization\" but also to the need \"to reject neighbourhoods in favour of an integrated complex 'all -use' urban texture.\"51 Here, Safdie's preferred source was Yona Friedman, whose \"'L'Architecture Spatiale'\" was, he believed, \"marked by a penetrating analysis of the issues, the design and fabrication of the unit dwelling, its relation to the overall structure which, in turn, relates to its magnitude and the provisions of servicing and circulation\" (fig. 5.9). 52 Begun in the late 1950s, Friedman's Ville spatiale proposed \"tripling the housing density of the c ity centre\" by \"applying the technique of superposition\" - writ large in a mammoth space frame floating over the existing city where \"new housing, industry, and agriculture will be added\" by filling \"empty spaces in this grid\" with \"cells\". 53 Still, to Saf die, Friedman's \"gigantic enveloping structure of an urban size into which we insert dwelling, shops, etc., at will, poses technical problems to which we do not yet have solutions.\" 54 In other words, the vision was somehow unconvincing: it was not bound by the constraints of extant technology. Safdie's deliberate 51 Safdie, \"The Master Plan: Grow th, Change and Repetition\", Habitat , 4. 52 Safdie, \"A Case for 3. 53 Yona Friedman, \"Paris Spatial: (1961), in Martin van Schaik and Otakar M\u00e1 cel, eds., Exit Utopia: Architectural Provocations 1956 -76 (Munich: Prestel, 2005), 19-28. Friedman repeatedly insisted on \"conserving as much of today's city as possible.\" He took exception to the precedent of Le Corbusier's \"plan for Paris\" that \"envisaged the reorganisation of the centre of Paris alone, whereas the problem today extends to the whole city.\" Friedman's proposal was only a part of a broader vision of \"mobile city planning\" initiated in 1958, after which he began drawing aerial cities hovering over any number of settings, whether Paris, New York, or Algiers. Friedman initiated GEAM - Groupe d'Etudes d'Architecture Mobile - whose founding manifesto demanded: \"Reform of property rights in building land and air space with a view to achieving easier interchange. Introduction of a system of stratified utilization of a ir space by the inhabitants.\" See: GEAM, \"Programme for a Mobile Architecture (1960), in Ulrich Conrads, ed., Programs and Manifestoes of 20 th-century Architecture (Cambridge MA: The MIT Press, 1971) , 167-168. Safdie, \"The Plan: Growth, Change a Repetition\", in Habitat , 4. 288 use of axonometric drawing for the housing units was, therefore, meant to offer a sense of constructional plausibility. In turn, sectional perspectives looked deep into multiple apartment interio rs. The resulting fourteen dwelling types \"combined to result in great variety\" and produced the \"urban cluster\" of System A, a \"sector of 5000 inhabitants\" (fig. 5.10). 55 The translation between \"unit\" and \"cluster\" served to express the belief that a deliberate winnowing of resources could, in 1961, lead to \"the privilege of choice - repetition is voluntary act.\"56 Even as the freedom of \"choice\" could grow from the constraint of \"repetition\", Safdie's approach implied a view of technology , whether mecha nical or informational or spatial, in which the object - the \"unit\", the \"cell', the \"box\" - was necessarily valued in excess of its inherent functional properties . The dwelling unit itself was to signify not only Habitat 67, but the larger culture of industrialised building it was believed to symbolise. KEYWORDS From \"unit\" to \"group\", from \"repetition\" to \"variety\" to \"cluster\" - Safdie's terms were to imbricate his architectural project by social , spatial, and technological significance. Forming the initial theoretical base of his thinking on housing in the modern city, these ideas would soon inform his entire approach to Habitat 67. In turn, the very same concepts would be 55 Safdie, \"A Case for City Living\", Habitat , 5. 56 Safdie, \"The Master Plan: Growth, Change and Repetition\", in Habitat, 7. 289 appropriated by the CCWE when promoting Habitat as a \"prototype\" with extraord inary significance for architecture culture. While emerging from A Case for City Living, Safdie's keywords were hardly sui generis . The sources were surely plentiful, not least prevailing discourses in architectural journals , to which Safdie was finely a ttuned .57 Yet Safdie's polemic benefited from a uniquely intimate and fruitful engagement with his thesis advisor, Daniel van Ginkel.58 Van Ginkel's role in initiating the emergence of Team 10 out of CIAM centred on replacing modernist dogma on the \"functional city\" with a more phenomenological experience of \"community\". Between the late 1950s and early 1960s, Safdie immersed himself in Team 10 thought. H is eventual elaboration of A Case for City Living as the ur -project of Expo 67 \"housing exhibit\" would rest on the careful refinement of concepts such as \"group\" and \"cluster\" - and, most importantly, \"habitat\". 57 A keen observer of architectural magazines as a student, Safdie had published the study \"Changing Editorial Policy in American Architectural Periodicals, 1890- 1940\" in Journal of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada (August 1959 ). 58 While Safdie's official advisors were John Bland and Douglas Shadbolt, both professors in the McGill School of Architecture, he chose Daniel van Ginkel as an external advisor. Judging from the records of conversations in Safdie's sketchbooks, it is clear that van Ginkel became the main intellectual interlocutor. Safdie noted: \"Sandy van Ginkel has been very important in my development. I first saw him in a lecture he gave at McGill when I was in fifth year. (He had taught there previously.) In his lecture he talked about many of the experiences in Europe, about his work with Aldo van Eyck his partner in Holland, about CIAM (Congr\u00e8s International d'Architecture Moderne). When thesis time arrived in sixth year Doug Shadbolt, as my teacher, was my immediate critic, but I asked permission to have van Ginkel as a critic as well. Even though he was no longer teaching at the school, he agreed to do it. Once a week I would go to him with my sketch book and we would talk and discuss the sketches. He was an inspiring critic. It was through him that I became familiar with European thought, and with the ideas of CIAM and the people around it\". See: Safdie, Beyond Habitat , 54-55. Bland has written that Safdie selected van Ginkel, who had previously taught at McGill in the late 1950s, as his advisor. See: John Bland, \"Moshe Safdie: A Profile\", in Irena Zantokska Buildings and Projects, 1967 -1992 (McGill -Queens University Press, 1996) , 14. 290 The fundamental correspondence between Team 10 debate and Safdie's programme lay in an expanded definition of \"habitat\". Van Ginkel had been instrumental to the 1954 \"Statement on Habitat\" (also known as the \"Doorn Manifesto\") that ushered the emergence of Team 10 from CIAM, and his engagement with Dutch discourse would especially inform Safdie's predilections and precedents. The 1953 CIAM congres s had been dedicated to defining \"La Charte de l'Habitat\". Among the exemplary work presented was that of ATBAT -Afrique, which explored ways of reorganising patterns of traditional dwelling as a basis of deriving modern architectural form. Later, van Ginkel's friend and onetime colleague Aldo van Eyck had advanced his \"aesthetics of number\", a view on housing with \"group\" and \"cell\" linked in a \"configurative discipline\" in which the multiplication of similar elements would not disappear in processes of repetition but gain greater individual significance while simultaneously building up a larger whole: \"a single complex system, polyphonal, multirhythmic, kaleidoscopic and yet perpetually and everywhere comprehensible\". 59 The influential first work was van Eyck's Amsterdam Orphanage of 1960. By the mid-1950s, there was already suggestion of the extraordinary prognostic (if cryptic) value given by van Eyck and others to associative spatial and social terms that, in turn, came forcefully to shape discourses o n \"habitat\". While open to interpretation , the question of \"number\" typically stood to define how an appreciable unit could give meaning to an individual building unit as well as be come aggregated i nto a more complex urban form. 59 Aldo Van Eyck, \"Steps toward a Configurative Discipline\" (1962), in Joan Ockman, ed., Architecture Culture 1943 -1968 (New York: Columbia Books on Architec ture and Rizzoli, 1993), 348-360. 291 This approach came togeth er forcefully in the September 1959 number of Forum , the architectural journal newly under the joint editorship of Team 10 members Jaap Bakema and Aldo van Eyck. Titled \"The Story of another Idea\" by Van Eyck, the special issue was timed to coincide with the final CIAM meeting held in Otterlo in September 1959.60 The cover showed pin -wheeling terms and phrases collected from nascent Team 10 debate (fig. 5.11): cluster change and growth \u00e0 mi-chemin [Half -way (in relation to other cultures)] imagination vers us common -sense appreciated unit la plus grande realit\u00e9 du seuil [the philosophy of the doorstep] interieur de gemeenschap of the community] identity het ogenblik van core [core] hierarchy of human association mobility l'habitat pour le plus grand nombre [habitat for the largest section of the population] harmony in motion aspect of ascending dimensions identifying devices gedifferentieerde wooneenheid [differentiated dwelling unit] 60 Enlarged copies of the Forum issue were hung throughout the Otterlo meeting. The congress was chronicled by the Canadian architect Oscar Newman in CIAM '59 in Otterlo (Stuttgart: Karl Kramer, 1961). Blanche Lemco van Ginkel noted that Newman was not present at Otterlo and that the meeting was \"scandalously misrepresented\" in his book partly due to poor tape recordings; see: Eric Mumford, The CIAM Discourse on Urbanism (Cam bridge MA: The MIT Press, 2000), 338, n.225. S afdie eventually invited Newman to serve, along with Douglas Shadbolt ( Safdie's professor at McGill ), as consultant on the \"storyline\" of the Man in the Community theme section, which was originally to be set within the first version of Habitat 67. Soon a fter submitting his report to the Expo 67 committee, Newman penned an important early (and not necessarily complimentary) appraisal of Habitat 67; see: Newman, \"Habitat '67: A Critique\", Canadian Architect (October 1964): 37- 46. 292 visual group61 The terms reflected van Eyck's idiosyncratic view vis -\u00e0-vis Team 10, especially in the search for sources corresponding to his anti -functionalism. In defining \"The Story of another Idea\", van Eyck jux taposed photographs from Africa (taken from Life magazine and the Magnum agency) and images of Dogon settlements in Mali (which he had seen the previous winter) with, first, the influential Lijnbaan pedestrian mall newly built by Van den Broek and Bakema i n Rotterdam and, second, examples of new \"structuralist\" tendencies in Dutch architecture that used identical prefabricated units to suggest both centrality and dispersal as well as order and flexibility (fig. 5.12).62 Van Eyck's fascination for Dogon arch itecture had precedent in travels with van Ginkel and the Dutch anthropologist Herman Haan to villages in the Algerian Sahara in 1952. 63 He believed archaic cultures retained universal values of 61 For a translation of the Forum cover, see: Arnulf L\u00fcchinger, Structuralism in Architecture and 1981), 10-11. 62 Maristella Casciato, 69; Alan Colquhoun, Modern Arc hitecture Oxford University Press, 2000), 222. 63 Mumford, The CIAM Discourse on Urbanism , 338, n. 228. Van Eyck first described these trips in Forum 1 (January 1953). While teaching at Washington University in St Louis in 1961- 1962, he published the \"Architecture of the Dogon\" in Architectural Forum (September 1961). Van Eyck recalled: \"I had come upon Marcel Griuale's Dogon in Minotaure (mission Dakar -Djibouti 1931- 1933) during the war. The illustrations I knew by heart\"; s ee: Van Eyck, \"A Miracle of Moderation\", in Charles Jencks and George Baird, eds., Meaning in Architecture (New York: George Braziller, 1969), 173-213. Van Eyck's impressions were shaped by the ethnologists and physicians Paul Parin and Fritz Morgenthaler, wh o he met when visiting the Dogon. Minotaure, artistique et litt\u00e9raire was an important S urrealist magazine; its article on the Dogon appeared in June 1933. Herman Haan's view on indigenous dwellings appear ed (accompanied his wife Hansje Haan's phot ographs) in \"Life in the Desert\", Forum 1 (1960): 8 -15. An English version of Haan's text was included in the published account of the Otterlo meeting; see: Newman, CIAM '59 in , see: Karin Jaschke , Mythical Journeys: Ethnography, Archaeology, and the Attraction of Tribal Cultures in the Work of Aldo van Eyck and Herman Haan, PhD Dissertation, Princeton University (Ann Arbor: ProQuest/UMI Dissertations Publishing , 2012). Safdie heard of van Eyck's travels directly from van Ginkel: \"When I worked for Sandy we would sometimes sit after hours, late at night, with him telling me of his experiences with van Eyck, or his trip to the Sahara, or the CIAM meetings. I felt much devotion and loyalty to him.\" See: Safdie, Beyond Habitat , 55. 293 balancing collectivity suggestive of a \"culture of determined relationships\" that would better characterise twentieth -century consciousness of avant -gardism and science (fig. 5.13).64 Van Eyck saw in vernacular architectures a way of working outward from a basic signifying element while achieving an overall form that did not appear to be predetermined. This brought with it notions on serialisation or prefabrication. The attempt was to reinvigorate modern architecture via the \"abstract\" aesthetic of \"primitive\" cultures. Above all, the turn to th e vernacular rested on an interpretive method that could suggest new ways of organising social space. Safdie discovered van Eyck's discourse through van Ginkel. Team 10 concerns, especially the Dutch line, appeared in the repeated invocations of \"group\", \"cluster\", and \"identity\" during tutorials between master and pupil. Thus, when first publicly circulating ideas on A Case for City Living, Safdie hewed closely to van Eyck: Any use of an additive cellular urban structure, whether in a linear or other pattern will require a more imaginative approach to the problem of REPETITION. This is an aspect of the relation of one urban sector to another. Even more complex is repetition as an aspect of the design of the sector itself. We must overcome the menace of quantity, now that we are faced with habitat for the masses - the aesthetics of numbers... must be discovered . 65 Safdie's open - but unattributed - p invocation of van Eyck's concepts, including \"aesthetics of numbers\", appeared in a precocious theoretical statement on \"The Master Plan\" in the 64 Casciato, \"'Forum': Architecture and Culture in the Early1960s\", 69; Hans van Dijk, \"Forum : The Story of another Idea, 1953 -63\", in Dirk van den Heuval and Max Risselada, eds., Team 10 1953- 81: In Se arch of a Utopia of the Present (Rotterdam: NAi Publishers, 2005), 83. 65 Safdie, \"The Master Plan: Growth, Change and Repetition\", Habitat, 4; emphasis added. 294 CMHC journal Habitat, published immediately upon his graduation from McGill. The dialectic between \"addition\" and \"repetition\" would, when given architectural form, resolve problems of \"identity\" in modern urban life - a notion explained by Safdie in three accompanying illustrations: first, \"Tradition\", seen in a sketch of what appeared to be a North African oasis settlement and representing \"growth through slow evolution; repetition through necessity\"; second, an axonometric of units from A Case for City Living, showing a \"variety of dwelling types through the repetition of one element\"; and, third, a plan of a housing complex by the Amsterdam architect Piet Blom indicating a \"variety of spaces through repetition of a group of dwellings\" (fig. 5.14). 66 Read together, the three illustrations defined Safdie's idealised urban form: again, \"a habitat for the masses\" composed of repeated elements that gave a seemingly \"unplanned\" organisation of space. Importantly, A Case f or City Living began to be presented without any reference to being a student project. Thoughts on \"repetition\" indicated a way forward for contemporary architecture. \"Volumes have been written on space and structure in contemporary architecture\", Safdie declared, indirectly dismissing Siegfried Giedion's canonical Space, Time and Architecture , \"but repetition which is the challenging aspect of modern architecture is forgotten. Historical examples of repetition are numerous and are found in most vernacula rs; the mud domes of a North African village or tiled roofs of Italy\". 67 In the invocation of roofscapes, 66 Ibid., 5. 67 Ibid., 7. In his thesis sketchbooks, Safdie referred to the \"Italian hill town\" as a preferred model over the Nevertheless, Safdie recognised the \"major problem\" of \"light and air in this climate\" and asked 295 which marked the style of at least two of the three illustrations accompanying Safdie's article, was evidence, however schematic, of the kind of \"grow th\" and \"repetition\" desirable in an urban work. This was in keeping with van Eyck's deeply personal but polemical call for designing \" Vers une 'casbah' organis\u00e9e\" that concluded \"The Story of another Idea\" (fig. 5.15). Stemming from an abstract ion of vernacular forms, van Eyck's plea applied specifically to the geometric organisation of space, a paradigm for his Amsterdam Orphanage of 1960 (the year Safdie began his thesis). In trying to synthesise a series of invented binaries - \"part -whole\", \"unity -diversity\", \"individual-collective\" - a \"meaningless absolute\", van Eyck wished \"to conceive of architecture urbanistically and of urbanism architecturally\"; thus, the \"idea\" behind \"this home for children\" was \"to persuad e it to become both 'house' and 'city'\". 68 The notion was formalised in the small domed units resting on a visible grid of beams and columns. Likened to \"houses\", the elements were grouped together and arrayed in a shifting \"open\" pattern above corridors that were to function as internal \"streets\".69 Despite the programmatic complexity of the if his open -air stacking \"is ok in terms of the Mediterranean, is it ok in terms of Canada?\" See: Safd ie, \"Devel opment\" Sketchbook P, 16, took exception to received interpretations of Giedion . The consideration of \"space -time in architecture\" was, to Safdie, no longer based on a \"spatial interest resulting form a moving point of view\"; rather, it was \"f our-dimensional\", where a \"plan must grow with time, must change and transform as values and means evolve\". In a sense, he rejected an \"experiential\" model of design. See: Safdie, \"The Master Plan: Growth, and Repetition\", 68 Aldo van Eyck, \"The in Forum 6-7 (April -May 61): 237. On his idea to \"architecture urbanism architecturally\", van Eyck noted parenthetically \"this makes 1999), 37-38. 296 orphanage, the roof work - the dome signifying the \"house\" in the \"city\" - was redolent of the \"organised casbah\" apparently found by van Eyck in indigenous architecture . Safdie's interest in a repetitive structure delineating different spaces was made clear in his wilful collapsing together of Piet Blom's site plan, the oasis settlement, and his System A dwelling types. The project by Blom, van Eyck's favourite student, was instrumental to A Case for City Living. 70 Blom's housing estate showed individual dwellings linked in continuous but meandering lines that spread to imply the boundaries of any number of open or partially enclosed public spaces. 71 The suggestion wa s of a quasi -anarchic social paradigm expressed in the \"ope n\" geometries of the plan.72 In a m: Architecture & Natura, 1998), 332ff. V an Eyck showed hi s Amsterdam Orphanage alongside Blom's project during the 1959 CIAM meeting at Otterlo . Blom went go on to design the Kasbah housing estate in Hengelo, Holland, in 1973. Safdie also retain ed the \"casbah\" as an key principle : writing after the completion of Habitat 67, he set the \"steel and glass apartment building\" - a bugbear since the days of his CMHC scholarship travels and which he had associated with Mies van der Rohe's Lakeshore Drive Apartments in Chicago - against the \"opposite extreme\" of \"the casbah\" that \"corresponds with people's desire for identity and a notion of the scale of the community and their place within it.\" See: Safdie, Beyond Habitat , 45. 71 Van Eyck included Blom's project as a penultimate image before closing \"The Story of anoth er Idea\" with photographs of archaic architectures representing a \"'casbah' organis\u00e9e\". Several months after resigning from Expo 67, Daniel van Ginkel provide d an expanded definition of a \" casbah organis\u00e9e \": \"Although the first association with 'casbah' m ay be the tightness of clustered units, in reality it is much more than that. It is the total environment for both the child and the adult\" - a description echoing van Eyck's characterisation of the new village of Nagele, which he and Van Ginkel had worke d on in the mid -1950s - \"incorporating the daily activities of all citizens, the honky -tonk as well as the culture, squalor as well as grace. The casbah organis\u00e9e finds some of its realization in plans like Hook and Cumbernault [sic]\" - a reference to Hoo k New Town, an unrealised plan by architects the London County Council Architects' Department, and Cumbernauld Town Centre in Scotland, an important and much -celebrated \"megastructure\" designed by Geoffrey Copcutt in the early 1960s and built over the subs equent decade. See: van Ginkel, \"Credo\", Canadian Architect (July 1964): 46. 72 Blom's motto for his project was \"Let the cities be inhabited like villages\". Blom's ideology owed to his upbringing in a working class district of Amsterdam, which shaped his views on urbanism and subsequent distaste for functionalist planning; also notes that Aldo van Eyck took Blom to see Jaap Bakema's Pendrecht projects, thus introducing him to the schools designed by van Eyck and van 297 reproduced Blom's project exactly as it appeared in Forum (fig. 5.16).73 The drawings were accompanied by notes from a tutoria l with van Ginkel that, unsurprisingly, \"again discussed\" the \"problem\" of \"identity\": Identity : identity of the dwelling but also of the larger group + further groups: The visual group The cluster Furthermore the relationship of these was discussed: The p roblem: to achieve a complex grouping but which has unity. To have a group made of a unit with identity which combines to form a greater unity74 Emphasising three key concepts appearing on the cover of \"The Story of another Idea\", Safdie added a sketch t hat purposely retraced the forms of Dogon settlements as found in van Eyck's highly formalised photographs of cliffside dwellings and granaries and repeatedly published in Forum .75 While owing a considerable debt to van Eyck's view on the vernacular as a s ource for revivifying postwar architecture, Safdie's approach would differ in a crucial respect. Terms such as \"group\" or \"cluster\" ceased to betray any kind of anthropological or ethnological bias typical of van Eyck and others; instead, lessons on the v ernacular were distilled almost purely for their formal value. This was evident in the opening presentation panel of his thesis, in which A Case for City Living was divided into four themes: \"The 73 As Safdie may have learned from van Ginkel, who could translate Dutch, Blom's project as presented in Forum bore t he caption: \"the cities will inhabited like villages\". 74 Moshe Safdie, \"Development\" Sketchbook P, page 20, Moshe Safdie Archive, Canadian Architecture Collection, McGill University, Montreal. 75 Van Eyck's photographs emphasised the formal qualities of A frican architecture, with buildings depicted as abstract objects and where people were largely absent. See: Zeynip \u00c7elik, \"The Ordinary and the Third World at CIAM IX\", in Risselada and van der Heuvel, eds., Team 10, 1953 -81: in Search of a Utopia of the Present , 279. 298 Family\", \"Community Structure\", \"Living Environment\", and City\" (fig. panel followed the organisational aims of the CIAM grille - the graphic device created in 1947 to compare urban designs according to the four functions - but it was coded in the rhetorical suggestions of Team 10: \"The family unit must have identity\"; \"A sense of location must be created\"; \"A hierarchy of groups and their identity\". Moreover, unlike the CIAM and Team 10 grilles , Safdie never attempt ed to present any kinds of \" as found \" conditions. He made no use of photographs of everyday life in the city (at best, he used aerial views of Montreal to juxtapose better his modular \"Systems\"). 76 His presentation centred on a set of abstract diagrams outlining ideal social structures around or by which a new city could grow. Families would coalesce in a \"Primary Group\" (\"so that voluntary social relationships can take place\") that with others formed a \"Community\", which, following a similar process of addition, yielded a \"Cluster\" that, when multiplied, finally grew into a \"Sector\"; the new community was always to grow proximate to the exiting \"Core\" (or downtown). As such, Safdie's presentation board was not necessarily analytical: it did not offer evidence that A 76 If anything, then the Team 10 \"cultural\" turn enabled the group to recuperate the CIAM grille as a preferred method of presentation, but now animated by reinterpreting images culled from everyday life. The expansion of explicatory classes beyond the \"four functions\" was seen at the ninth CIAM congress held at Aix- en-Provence in July 1953, when nascent Team 10 ideas appeared in, for example, the GAMMA grid on bidonvilles in Casablanca or the Smithsons's Urban Re -Identification Grid that turned to street life in London's East End as embodying a \"house -street relationship\". (The Smithsons' images of children playing in working -class neighbourhoods were borrowed from the photographer Nigel Henderson, a fellow member of the Independent Group.) While CIAM grilles had also incorporated images of everyday life, this often kept with a \"scientific\" view on the amel ioration of existing conditions rather than using them as sources of design. The metaphorical gaps in Team 10's keyword -ideograms allow ed members to exploit, in different ways, the grilles as both analytical tools and as prophetic statements on design methods. On the CIAM \"Mapping the Modern City: Otto Neurath, the International Congress of Modern Architecture (CIAM), and the Politics of Information Design\", Design Issues (Summer 2006): 48 -65. 299 Case for City Living was made on the basis of actual faults or inequities in the existing city (say, Montreal); rather, it was prescriptive : the reduction to quasi-Venn diagrams as grounds for form was a kind of pretence of statistical veracity, with a small amount of demographic information (namely population growth, an in terest stemming from Safdie's CMHC research) meant to substantiate programmatic and functional needs. The abstraction of an entire social and architectural system into a set of circles conjoined by radial vectors suggested a weird preclusion of the immedi ate, existent world. In giving prognostic value to a constellation of terms - group and identity , unit and cluster - Safdie inherited from Team 10 a way to render social schema, however real or invented, as architectural forms. This was the justificatory role of his introductory thesis presentation panel. It was hardly surprising that the very same board announced Safdie's project in the pages of Forum one year after his graduation. Contextualised by a reprint of his essays \"Fallacies, Nostalgia and Real ity\" and \"A Case for City Living\" - serving as theoretical statements, having been shorn of the original corresponding images - the layout relied on drawings and models showing the project in total isolation. The thesis now dovetailed with discourses and styles from which it had borrowed so much. MEMORANDA When, in October 1963, Safdie first began proposing a housing project while working on the Expo 67 master plan, he sent a memorandum to the CCWE that synthesised the lessons of his student thesis (thoug h never mentioned as such) as the social and technical basis of 300 what would become Habitat 67. Safdie recognised the potential of realising a new type of architectural form in the tabula rasa of a world's fair. Moreover, he understood the necessarily dida ctic function - and corresponding cultural capital - of including mass housing within a spectacle such as a world's fair. \"Habitat 67/Permanent Housing Exhibit\", as he titled his memorandum, would be \"an opportunity to provide a meaningful demonstration of solutions to urban housing\"; initially \"used to house Exhibitors' personnel\" the project would eventually \"become an integral part of the City of Montreal\", providing \"a high density, urban development, thus dealing with the most pressing housing problems of today.\" 77 Drawing on the possibilities for \"growth\" and \"change\" established in A Case for City Living, Habitat 67 \"should be able to expand with need after 1967.\" This expansion was no longer registered by the ideal realm of three \"Systems\"; rather, it was to be actualised by real population shifts in Montreal itself. Only three years since his CMHC travels, Safdie found himself facing the possibility of shaping ideas on the contemporary North American city. The \"most pressing housing problems of to day\" gleaned during the CMHC sojourn were quantised in the 1961 Census of Canada, which noted that almost 70 percent of Canadian now lived in cities.78 Yet many critics were, at the start of the new decade, questioning whether any real impetus had come 77 Safdie, \"Habitat 67/Permanent Housing Exhibit\", 1. 78 Rose, Canadian Housing Policies 1935 -1980 , 44. The exact figure was 69.7 percent; by 1971, the proportion would increase to 76.1 percent. As the CMHC Economic Research Departmen t noted, the census would have important \"results\" that \"deal specifically with housing\". At the broadest level, \"the improvement in the quality of housing stock is, of course, the result of the high volume of residential construction in the postwar perio d\" - a trend that augured well for Safdie's ambitions. See: Frances T. Chambers, \"Housing and the 1961 Census\", Habitat (Ottawa, January -February 1963), 25. 301 from amendments to the National Housing Acts of 1949 and 1956, the latter introducing the term \"urban redevelopment\" in lieu of slum clearance; others noted \"weakness in our housing forecasts for 1955-1980\", suggesting the impossibility of an open economic - technological future (notwithstanding the presumed expansion of a welfare state).79 (Indeed, the federal -provincial public housing programme had produced only 12,000 units.80) At the same time, changes in Canadian policy - with the 1964 National Housing Act including \"urban renewal\" as an official category - found municipalities and cities envisioning planning as necessarily ongoing process and facet of civic life. As a 1959 report noted, \"'Urban renewal'... is not only a social instrument for relieving poor housing conditions but also an essential element of city growth; it should be as natural a part of the city's normal function as a paving programme.\" 81 As such, Safdie began turning to agencies such as CMHC during the realisation of Habitat 67, especially w hen calling for the superior credit of the state as the basis of urban housing. By the mid -1950s, CMHC had shifted from its initial mandate of housing returning war veterans to actively initiating both single -family home ownership and urban renewal scheme s - conditions in which A Case for City Living was imagined as 79 R. T. Adamson, \"The Weakness in Our Housing Forecasts for 1955 -1980\", Habitat (Ottawa, January - February 1959): 21. Adamson was the chief economist and later executive director of CMHC. 80 H.

Its annual publication Small House Designs compiled architects' drawings for purchase by builders and prospective home owners.84 The choices ranged from bungalows to split -levels to two -storey house s (fig. 5.18). Despite the increasing inclusion of a few reliably \"modern\" architects, the magazine Canadian Architect only saw an \"abominable hodgepodge of small houses\" without consideration of a \"building -unit system which would allow each family to as semble its own house on a small lot - tailored to the existing site conditions and to the family's needs and future growth\".85 The assessment jibed pe rfectly with Safdie's ambitions and the publication of his thesis along with new theoretical statements in Habitat, the CMHC journal, brought his ideas squarely within purview of the Canadian planning intelligentsia . Indeed, a long with Forum and Habitat, Safdie had managed to circulate his thesis in Architecture -B\u00e2timent- 82 While Safdie recognised the nexus of architecture culture and policy -making in \"urban renewal\", he likely had other interest in CMHC and was keenly aware of its ties to the Division of Building Research (DBR) of the National Research Council in Ottawa. Founded in 1947, a few months after the formation of CMHC, the DBR provide d technical research to CMHC. By the mid -1960s, it was fully engaged with issues of prefabrication and industrialised building systems that paralleled efforts in the construction of Habitat 67. Safdie turned to DBR studies when defining early concepts on Habitat 67; see: Safdie, \"Why not Utopia?\", in of Human Habitations (Roorkee, India: Nem Chand & Bros, 1966), 10. 83 Moshe Safdie, Sketc hbook S ( 1960 ): 49, Moshe Safdie Archive, Canadian Architecture Collection, McGill University, Montreal. 84 Small House Designs (Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation, 1958), 1. The Small House Designs catalogue, published annually by CMHC, was presage d by Choosing a House Design (1956) and Principles of Small House Design (1957). Plans that sold well were kept in subsequent catalogues. 85 Quoted in Ioana Teodorescu, \"Big Ideas, Small Houses\", Architect (May 2009): 58 -59. 303 Construction (A-B-C ), the main French -language architecture journal in Quebec (fig. 5.19).86 It was a remarkable penetration of his ideas in local, national, and international architecture culture, and in sources targeted to professional and policy -making audiences. Safdie followed, somewhat obliquely, the van Ginkels' early mandate to base the world's fair specifically on a housing exhibition that, in turn, would spur development in the heart of the existing city. As part of their Man in the City project, the van Ginkels had proposed an \"In ternational Housing Section\" as a \"live housing demonstration\" that \"would constitute an exhibition of the best in contemporary housing\", a project they favourably likened to the Berlin Interbau.87 Safdie similarly imagined that the \"housing requirements generated by the event of Expo 67 offer an opportunity to provide meaningful demonstration of solutions to urban housing\"; consequently Habitat 67 \"will be used to house Exhibitors' personnel, after which the development would become an integral part of the City of Montreal.\"88 Yet writing over a year after the v an Ginkels' initial formulation , Safdie differed with their concept: \"Gathering a group of architects of various countries to design individual buildings (Berlin Interbau)\" produced \"results\" that \"h ave not been successful. A number of fine buildings put together at random cannot be a meaningful 86 Habitat first appe ared in 1958. By the early 1960, the journal had become not only a vehicle to communicate CMHC policy but an important exchange on both Canadian urban renewal schemes and trends in international (but not always Western) urban design. 87 \"Draft Re port on M ontreal World's Fair\" (July 1962) : 2, Box 27 -A21, Folder 11, Fonds van Ginkel, Canadian Centre for Architecture, 88 Safdie, 67/Perm anent Housing Exhibit\", 1 . 304 urban achievement.\"89 A Case for City Living was predicated on countering the fragmentary urbanism of the \"tower -in-the-park\". As such, Safdie argued for lo cating Habitat 67 on \"Point St. Charles -Mackay Pier\" , the harbour front site promoted by the Port of Montreal many months earlier (when confronting the van Ginkels' aim for a world's fair as first enabling slum clearance in nearby districts). For Safdie, the islands were always a foregone conclusion; thus, his preferred site was both \"a natural extension of the Exhibition\" and \"a nucleus for an extension of the city towards the river\". 90 Set between city and fair, the housing exhibition was to draw on the respectively quotidian and ideal dimensions of each. Nevertheless, Safdie recognised that his project needed to be an enclave set apart from the exigencies of the city , thus better to suggest a reinvention of the modern environment and to frame an ideal v ision of mass society. The coming call by the CCWE to see Safdie's project as \"prototype\" could only function, as a kind of propaganda, in this kind of space . Still, the model of Interbau rankled. His wariness of the Berlin model signalled a worry that t he Expo 67 housing exhibition could, for example, be produced by many competing architects - and echo, perhaps, of the van Ginkels' earliest fears of architects designing separate national pavilions. 91 Instead of different buildings, no matter how exemplar y, A Case for City Living provided a rationale for a typical prefabricated \"unit\" 89 Ibid., 3 -4. 90 Ibid., 2. 91 Safdie resisted attempts to open the housing p roject to other architects, including a proposal by the Cement Companies of Canada (otherwise an important early patron on Habitat 67) for an international design competition: \"Quite apart from my obsession and conviction about Habitat I was sure that any big, vague, international competition would lead nowhere. I felt what I had put down on paper had a validity that gave it the right to come into existence.\" See: Safdie, Beyond Habitat , 81. 305 suited to many applications. Safdie thus promoted the idea of \"gathering a team of architects to design a total integrated complex .\"92 The \"General Approach\" would be one wh ere The entire sector will be an integrated three -dimensional whole in which housing is in the external \"membrane\" overlooking the river and city and with maximum contacts with sun and light, fresh air and the view. This, in turn, encloses spaces which ar e used as auxiliary spaces, commercial and otherwise, and parking and storage. The interior spaces are \"market-like\" areas of enormous scale. During the Exhibition, they are the major display area. The membrane of housing and offices is transparent in its nature allowing light, sun and air into the interior public spaces. This is complemented by large openings oriented for maximum benefit of cooling summer breezes.... The entire urban complex is designed so as to create its own micro climate in each season. 93 The \"integrated three -dimensional whole\" owed to the core argument of A Case for City Living : to prove the viability of using industrialised building techniques for creating a city in toto. Nevertheless, while trying to define a \"three -dimensional w hole\", Safdie made a crucial change to his conception of form. The shift lay in the mention of a \"membrane\" (composed \"of housing and offices\") and appeared in a second sketch appended to his CCWE memorandum. Unlike the distinct patterns of earlier \"systems\", the new drawing, l abelled \"Schematic Plan -Housing Exhibit\", showed three pairs of massive inclined triangular planes, each forming a half -pyramid shell with two opposing faces composed of stacked rectangular elements identified as \"housing\" and \"acce ss\" (fig. 5.20). Under the coupled planes were terraces for \"exhi bition/commercial\" while outside was the vague suggestion of a \"park\". The p lan was deliberately calibrated to the fair: the complex rested alongside a river flowing 92 Safdie, \"Habitat 67/Permanent Housing Exhibit\", 2 -3, emphasis added. 93 3, emphasis added . 306 east-west with the hous ing facing southward, an arrangement that followed precisely the orientation of Mackay Pier. In placing this remarkable pyramidal scheme within the mandate of Expo 67 , Safdie turned, once again, to his published work. Unsurprisingly, like the sketch quietly appropriated from A Case for City Living, the Schematic Plan was , in a slightly different form, already in circulation. Safdie had concluded \"The Master Plan: Growth, Change and Repetition\", the final of his three articles penned for the CMHC journal Habitat, with \"a basic idea for the city plan which can be interpreted into formal terms in various ways.\" T he corresponding illustrations - which followed immediately the juxtaposition of the oasis settlement, Piet Blom's housing project, and Safdie's A Case for City Living unit types - showed a scattering of \"detached units\" aggregating into \"taller structures\" and eventually piling up into a \"large pyramid\", with \"dwellings set on three sides and the fourth side open for light and air\", \"parking, shops, schools and other communal facilities\" in the space\", and . 5.21). 94 The diagrams could well have been misinterpreted as championing a kind of spontaneous or ad hoc settlement, and Safdie argued that \"the plan in which time and growth are basic dimensions cannot be a formal statement since definition of exact building form is not possible at the outset.\"95 While denying any a priori formal intent, Safdie posited a \"basic plan diagram\" that \"would set the programme\", thus show ing a series of pyramids connected to an \"employmen t- 94 Safdie, \"The Master Plan: Gro wth, Change and Repetition\", 6. 95 Ibid., 7. 307 production -consumption spine\": \"as the spine expands new sectors appear.\"96 This fixed line of commerce and industry was really the appearance of a public terrain along (or around) which the presumably more \"flexible\" and private parts of the plan - namely the housing - could forever \"grow\". At the scale of the world's fair, the \"spine\" would hold the entire \"exhibition\". To the reader, not least the Expo authorities familiar with Safdie's still short career, the unnamed and unspecified pyramidal plan may well have seemed utterly mystifying. Yet, as in so many of Safdie's propositions, the idea stemmed from a specific personal source: an unrealised master plan for Meadowvale , a new town in Ontario , which Safdie had helped to advance while working with the van Ginkel s soon after his graduation. The van Ginkels saw Meadowvale as embodying a \"definite system of growth\"; part of their resulting plan bore resemblance to Nagele, a new village designed by van Eyck as member of the Amsterdam CIAM 'de 8' group in the early 1950s, which eschewed traditional settlement patterns in favour of an open centre (including three school built by van Eyck and van Ginkel) with residential units u nited in a complex , non -repetitive composition. 97 Safdie 's Meadowvale drawings were, however, of an entirely different order. Working closely with van Ginkel for 96 Ibid. 97 Max Risselada, \"Nagele Grid, 1956\", in van den Heuval and Risselada, eds., Team 10 1953- 81: In Search of a Utopia of the Present , 58; Francis Strauven, \"The Shaping of Number in Architecture and Town Planning\", in van den Heuval and Risselada, eds., Team 10 1953- 81: In Search of a Utopia of the Present , 297. As Strauven notes, the Nagele plan was a small- scale demonstration of van E yck's concept of \"the aesthetics of number\". Van Eyck presented the Nagele grille at the tenth CIAM meeting in Dubrovnik in 1956. 308 four months , Safdie attempted to discover how a \"core\" could \"grow\".98 He borrowed heavily from Kenzo Tange's \"civic axis\" for the Tokyo Bay plan of 1960, with its \"radial structure\" of traffic feeding into a \"linear structure\"; the proposition aimed at \"rejecting the closed organization of the centripetal pattern in favour of an open organization which makes possible a development along a linear pattern\".99 He especially turned to Tange 's residential sectors in which massive parabolic terrace blocks were mirrored to enclos e a huge interior space for public functions (fig. 5.22).100 These were linked by streets connected perpendicularly to the \"civic axis\", thereby creating \"subcentres\" that became \"r egional centres of consumption\".101 It was precisely what Safdie envisioned in his idea of an expandable \"spine\". Extrapolating from Tange, Safdie's triangular parti grew from tracing the increasing height and density of functions along the Meadowvale spine. Inspired by Tange, Safdie proposed a cross -section in which stacked banks of housing covered common areas for \"school\", \"community\", \"shops\", and \"p arking\". An individual pyramid, comprising 700 dwellings, became a \"neighbourhood\" join ing other ones when connected to the continuous spine (fig. 5.23). The notion of an \"additive\" structure now followed the 98 Safdie's proposal for Meadowvale can be seen as a parallel exercise to the actual planning work by the van Ginkels. His a pproach fol lows closely that of his thesis: all concepts are developed in one large -format sketchbook with written notes of conversation s between him and van Ginkel. The sketches are dated from August to December 1961. 99 Kenzo Tange, \"A Plan for Tokyo, 1 960\" (1961), in Udo Kultermann, Kenzo Tange, Architecture and Urban Design 1946 -1969 (New York: Praeger, 1970): 123. 100 The style of Tange's residential blocks grew out of his World Health Organization Headquarters and Boston Bay projects undertaken with s tudents at MIT in 1959. 101 Tange, \" A Plan for Tokyo, 1960\", 123. 309 new and preferred idea that \"Hierarchy is a Pyramid\". \"Autocracy\" remained, as ever, the tower block. The origins of Habitat 67 as a \"total integrated complex\" - or, \"inte grated three- dimensional whole\" - lay in what could be described as Safdie's growing preoccupation with regional planning. While Safdie's thesis project had focused on the use of a building system to delineate a carefully planned \"community\", the aim behind the world's fair housing exhibit was to realise a complete \"city\". Indeed, Safdie's work on the Expo 67 transportation system s was tied to an obsession with extending the exhibition far beyond the fairgrounds and into the city itself. This informed the Schematic Plan: with \"membranes\" of housing covering the world's fair thematic exhibitions areas, the resulting total complex \" could be conceived as a sector of the city\" in itself. 102 The pyramids were, then, to be much more than the typical pavilion. In this sense, Habitat would keep with the early and polemical mandate of Expo 67 - that is, to create an entire exhibition, there by announc ing its universalising mission within one massive building. MAN VERSUS THE CITY Safdie returned to Montreal in late August 1963 to work on the Expo 67 master plan. He had spent the previous year in Louis Kahn's office but left on van Ginkel's promise that he could turn his McGill thesis into a project for the world's fair. Joining the young architects assembled by van Ginkel, Safdie was immediately charged with four \"tasks\": and, specifically, \"design studies o f the thematic area\"; second, \"Thematic Development\", which was \"concerned with spelling out the implications of the thematic ideas in terms of physical planning and design\"; third, the thematic development of \"Man in the City\", a reintroduction of the van Ginkels' very first expression on Expo 67; and, fourth, \"Housing - Man in the City\", an \"investigation of the possibility of making a housing exhibit which could remain as a permanent structure after the Fair while being integrated with the MAN IN THE CITY aspect of the theme.\"103 The work pro gram directly set the still abstract quality of the \"theme\" in terms of the actualities of \"physical planning\", which, in turn, was given a specific programmatic and typological valence - a \"housing exhibit\" mediat ing, on the one hand , the space of a world's fair that promised an entirely novel way to situate \"man\" in the \"world\", and, on the other hand, Montreal itself, which served as necessary foil to the new \"permanent structure\" proposed for ameliorating of the status of \"man\" in the 'city\". Given his former student's work, van Ginkel hardly saw Safdie's assignments in isolation. Rather, the four \"tasks\" were cross -referenced and shared overlapping dea dlines to be completed by mid -October. Above all, the telescop ing from theme to thematic area, from Man in the City to housing exhibit , and from the temporary world's fair to a \"permane nt structure\" meant that, notwithstanding the islands site, van Ginkel still held some hope for shaping space relations between expos ition and city. While the horizon of expectation for 103 H.P. Daniel van Ginkel, \"Planning and Design Work Program No. 3\" (September 19, 1963): 7, 9, 13, 20, 26, Box 39- 1999- 05, Folder 02, Fonds Gilles Gagnon, Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal. 311 the proposed \"housing exhibit\" was necessarily delimited by the Expo 67 master plan, the boundary was an ideal constraint, reinforcing the belief that only a supra -national entity like a world's fair co uld imaginatively re -order civic space. The actual application of A Case for City Living to Expo 67 depended on an additional but crucial specification. Despite the technological aesthetic of his thesis, Safdie had never identified the structural ( or consequently financial) basis of how his \"systems\" were to \"grow\" . Van Ginkel may well have recognised this shortcoming . Thus , right around the time Safdie began work ing on the Expo master plan, van Ginkel met with the Committee of Cement Companies to assess their interest in participating in the world's fair. The members of this Canadian industry sought \"to put in place a scheme as big as Expo 67 itself\". 104 The consortium was represented by the Montreal architect Jean -Louis Lalonde. Lalonde had, in fact, contributed to the seminal PQAA retreat. On behalf of the cement companies, he was charged with establishing \"the general outline of a project\" - in other words, a work of architecture - \"that the Committee would sponsor for Expo.\" 105 Notwithstanding assumptions on the typical needs of industrial concerns, Lalonde would, in fact, come to articulate the context of the proposed work in surprisingly polemical terms. 104 \"Habitat 67\", Architecture -B\u00e2timent- Construction (December, 1963): 48, translation by author. The \"proposition\" was forwarded \"in the name of all the cement companies of Canada by the pr esidents of the four enterprises established in Quebec.\" 105 Jean-Louis Lalonde, \"Preparation of a preliminary study for the Committee's participation in the Canadian World Exhibition, Montreal 1967\" (September 5, 1963): n.p., Box PF11, File 58/100/PF4/13, Moshe Collection, McGill University, Montreal; van Ginkel, \"Planning and Design Work Program No. 3\", 9 . Lalonde was already serving as a professional liaison to Safdie and Adele Naud\u00e9's work on transforming the \"them e\" into a master plan. 312 The industrial -technical bases represented by the Committee unambiguously denoted certain kinds of architectural propositions. Safdie's early invocation of prefabricated \"cells\", the received examples of van Eyck (whose reinterpretation of vernacular forms occurred via the plasticity of concrete), and the ethos of \"brutalism\" marking architecture culture in the early 1960s, may well have coloured the engagement of the cement companies.106 Architecture -B\u00e2timent-Construction observed: \"The significant rise of the cement industry in these last few years anticipates the manifold and intensive applicati on of this material for the diverse structures of the Exhibition.\"107 The cement companies - as patrons - were seen as the best of modern industrial enterprises, with research applied to the realm of design. As both a technique - prefabrication - and an ae sthetic, concrete was synonymous new Canadian architecture , notably John Andrews's Scarborough College (1965), Arthur Erickson's Simon Fraser University (1965), or the ARCOP's Place Bonaventure (1968). 108 These large-scale works, often photographed as hermetic containers, were seen, especially when published internationally, as withstanding an inhospitable climate as well as engendering new kinds of social life inside their heroic forms. This drew, in a 106 It is difficult to know whether van Ginkel invited the Cement Companies or was solicited by them. 107 \"Habitat 67\", Architecture -B\u00e2timent- Construction, 48, translation by author. 108 For ways in which concrete was being discussed by leading Canadian architects see, for example: Raymond Affleck, \"A Need for More Hands\", Canadian Architect (September 1966), which describes the building of Place Bonaventure , a much noted megastructure ; and Melvin Charney \"Concrete, A Material, A System, and an Environment\", Architecture Canada (June 1968). In the mid -1960s , Charney advanced the design of school s in terms of concrete \"systems\"; see his articles \"Learning Environments\", Architecture Canada (March 1968), \"Les possibilites de la construction en beton prefabrique dans la conception nouvelle des ecoles\", Architecture -B\u00e2timent- Construction (March 1967), and \"Ecole primaire Cure Grenier, Notre -Dame des Laurentides\", Architecture -B\u00e2timent- Construction (November 1967). 313 sense, on a prewar legacy of finding in Canada, in the New World, engineered structures - namely concrete grain elevators , as seen in Walter Gropius 's in Deutsche Werkbund Jahrbuch (devoted to \"Die Kunst in Industrie und Handel\") of 1913, Bruno Taut's Modern Architecture of 1929, or Le Corbusier's Vers une ar chitecture (and the polemic on an \"engineer's aesthetic\" ) of 1923 - as avatars of modernism. Despite his mandate, Lalonde refrained from tying the Committee's industrial interests to a specific technics . He proposed only a programmatic orientation, albeit one to which the cement companies saw themselves perfectly suited. After meetings with van Ginkel, Lalonde noted that the housing exhibit, as one of the \"main aspects\" of \"Terre des Hommes\", will deal with \"'The City' in its broadest sense: civilisation, the result of man's control and organization of his environment\"; thus \"the urbanization of our world, and consequently the urban scene, will occupy a major part of the exhibits.\" 109 The ultimate medium of this broad humanistic claim would be \"an experimental residential development \": \"Ideally, about 2,000 dwellings should be aimed at to obtain a large enough population to justify a complete organization including schools, commercial centre (retail), recreational and sport centre, churches, etc.\" - an aspir ation that extended the typical function of a pavilion 109 Lalonde, \"Preparation of a preliminary study for the Committee's participation in the Canadian World Exhibition, Montreal 1967\", n.p . Early in their deliberations , Daniel van Ginkel and Michel Chevalier had identified \"The City\" as one of the key \"exhibit subjects\" of Expo 67: it \"gives an opportunity to present aspects of civilization and culture, as 'La Cit\u00e9'; for this purpose, the City can present cultures of all ages, and all parts of the world.\" 314 from a site of display to a place of living.110 Given that \"the total cost of such an enterprise would be in the order of 40 million dollars\", it \"would be possible... to establish the total skeleton of t his project and build for Expo just enough dwellings to present a realistic picture of the total thing, plus the necessary amenities required right at the outset.\"111 In other words, under the imprimatur of the world's fair, any partial realisation of the housing exhibit could still be seen as fully -functional, especially given its actual distance from (but also its symbolic dependence upon) the existing city. Incompletion was not an issue. As outlined by Safdie in A Case for City Living, it was the sugges tion of an \"open\" building \"system\", and not necessarily the full realisation of a city all at once, that pointed the way forward. URBANISM The link between the CCWE and the Cement Companies brought industry within the cultural ambit of the world's fair. At first glance, this may have seemed to contradict the earliest principles laid down by the van Ginkels and others - namely, to eschew nationalist-corporatist interests and symbols. Yet the role of the cement companies in the housing exhibit was of a di fferent order: the proposed nexus would demonstrate (as an exhibit) how society (and the corresponding figure of \"man\") could quite literally be constructed. \"Habitat 67 is not a dream of the future\", the CCWE insisted; rather, \"by taking advantage 110 almost immediately revise d Lalond e's projection: \"Approximately 1,200 housing units would fulfill the Corporation's obligations to I.B.E. and be of sufficient size to form an impressive exhibition piece of housing and all related facilities\"; see: Safdie, \"Habitat 67/Permanent Housing Exhibit\", 1. 111 Lalonde, \"Preparat ion of a preliminary study for the Committee's participation in the Canadian W orld Exhibition, Montreal 1967\", n.p . 315 of mod ern technology\" it will \"provide a stimulus for recognition and analysis of the critical problems facing the 20th century city.\"112 This was not a call for total urban renewal. \"Cities are the cultural repositories of man\" announced the CCWE, pace Safdie. \"They are the containers of its history.\"113 In other words, the existing city had recognisable institutions, processes, and spaces that could be leveraged (hence the notion of completing the housing with schools and churches) while being simultaneously re organised. The resulting operation would be both technological - the use of \"mass production\" for creating housing units (with the lingering desire to create \"systems\") - and social - based, first, on the continued domestic demand for \"variety and selection\" in the \"choice of dwelling\", which stemmed from the \"basic needs\" of \"differing life-patterns of families and individuals\", and, second, on the civic needs for \"easy and convenient access to places of business, shops, playgrounds, and places of cultura l activity\". 114 Nevertheless, Lalonde declared, \"The City has evolved from the Middle Ages without integrating the new elements that were added to its original content.\"115 This gap between a received historic urban pattern and a host of modern types needed resolution. 112 Canadian Corporation for the 1967 World Exhibition Press Service, \"Prelude to Habitat 67: The City and its Malcontents\" (no date), Canadian Corporation for the World Exhibition Fonds, RG71, Vol. 445, Library and Archives Canada, Ottawa. While this document was issued by the Press Service, it likely stemmed from Safdie (as conclusions drawn from his CMHC travel report and articles published in Habitat ) and published in late 1963 or early 1964. 113 Ibid. 114 Ibid. While \"choice of dwelling\" remained tied to the needs of privacy as well as familial \"growth\" in the suburbs, there was a more alarming concern: \"Suburban communities tend to be drab, artificial, boring and transitory. They have given to a high incidence of alcoholism among suburban housewives.\" 115 Lalonde, \"Preparation of a preliminary study for the Committee's participation in the Canadian World Exhibition, Montreal 1967\", n.p . 316 Required, then, was a \"project\" that will \"provide an organized environment where man will find the advantages of nature (what he is now looking for in the suburbs)\" and \"where all the elements (habitation, circulation, parking, services, amenities) would be integrated in a three - dimensional whole.\" 116 Here, the city itself was believed to be ordered anew within a single work that could only be realised within the progressive mandate - that is, extra-civic and supra -national - of a world's fair. The agendas of the cement Companies and the CCWE dovetailed, however temporarily, in early September 1963, when van Ginkel seconded Lalonde as consultant to Safdie. Over the next month , the two architects began studying how to link the \"tasks\" of \"thematic development\" and \"Housing - Man in the City\". 117 The pressing issue became what a \"three -dimensional whole\" looked like. This still fairly abstract architectural form was to reflect existing realities. The \"nature of the project\" was an \"urban resident ial area corresponding to present day knowledge and requirements.\"118 This, Lalonde emphasised, would be \"THE STUDY OF AN URBAN RESIDENTIAL SECTOR BASED ON THE MOST ADVANCED THINKING, RESEARCH AND TECHNIQUES AVAILABLE ON THE 116 Ibid. 117 Van Ginkel, \"Planning and Design Work Program No. 3\", 26 . Safdie note d that \"the Association of Cement Industries... initiated the project as early as 1963\" and \"it has always proposed to participate and indeed it initiated Habitat '67, the constru ction of a model community\"; see: Safdie, \"Theme Exhibit Man and the City, Habitat 67 and Labyrinth (N.F.B.) and T heir Relationship\" (December 12, 1963): 1 -2, Box PF12, Folder 5/100/PF5/25, Moshe Safdie Archive, Canadian Architecture Collection, McGill Uni versity, Montreal. 118 Lalonde, \"Preparation of a preliminary study for the Committee's participation in the Canadian World Exhibition, Montreal 1967\", n.p . 317 INTERNATIONAL SCENE\".119 Safdie a dded: \"The project will be a high density, urban development, thus dealing with the most pressing housing problems of to -day\".120 In petitioning contemporary \"knowledge\", ms\", Safdie and Lalonde sought to obviate specific kinds of precedents. The original purpose of Man in the City as the prime mover of a future exhibition was, of course, an \"International Housing Section\" that \"would constitute an exhibition of the best i n contemporary housing\" and had been modelled on the Interbau. 121 In clarifying the aims of the fair a year after the van Ginkels' initial formulation, Lalonde joined Safdie in disagreeing agree with the se received ideals: On two occasions in the last 40 ye ars experimental housing developments were built in Germany, with the contribution of famous architects from many nations. But, as a result of such varied contribution by individual \"stars\", these developments contributed little to an organized urban sche me, however interesting the individual buildings might have been architecturally. 122 Posed against free-standing objects of the 1927 Weissenhofsiedlung Exhibition in Stuttgart or the 1957 Interbau in Berlin was the 1967 Montreal exhibition - or, really, the actual \"urban complex itself\", which constituted the \"major subject\" of Expo 67, with \"the 119 Jean-Louis Lalonde, \"Habitat 67: A Proposal to the Canadian World Exhibition Corporation by the Committee of Canadian Cement Companies for Expo 67\" (October 1963): 3, Box PF3, Moshe Safdie Archive, Canadian Architecture Collection, McGill University, Montreal. Safdie, \"Habitat 67/Permanent Housing Exhibit\", 121 Montreal World's F air\", 2. Van Ginkel later noted that the University Street site, which was not coincidentally part of their plan for Place Victoria (a new urban development in Montreal) , avoided the \"mistake of 'Interbau'\" because it was \"within the fabric of the city\". See: van Ginkel, \"Credo\", Canadian Architect (July 1964): 52. 122 Lalonde, \"Preparation of a preliminary study for the Committee's participation in the Canadian World Exhibitio n, Montreal 1967\", n.p. 318 HABITAT OF MAN\" as its \"main element\" .123 Here was - in Lalonde's critical titling - \"Habitat 67\": \"a meaningful demonstration of new concepts in urban housing\", which \"without trying to be futuristic, would still be indicative of things to come; it would bring in focus the technical and sociological problems confronting our cities today, and would propose a solution based on methods at the experimental stage.\"124 Desp ite the potential for the Cement Companies to offer specific \"technical\" - read: experimenta l - \"solutions\", Lalonde refrained from lobbying for their particular expertise. He made little suggestion on specific formal, technical, or structural solutions f or Habitat, save for characteris ing it as a \"gigantic super -structure\" that could \"provide a desirable framework for urban living today\".125 Yet prior to actually naming Habitat 67 , Lalonde had indicated that the proposed \"experimental area for the Expo\" would, in fact, be \"defined as a conclusion\" to \"a number of case studies pertinent to the subject of the City in general, and to the residential sectors in particular\"; these examples were to appear \"in appendix\" in the formal proposal to the 123 Ibid. 124 Lalonde, \"Habitat 67: A Proposal to the Canadian World Exhibition Corporation by the Committee of Canadian Cement Companies for Expo 67\", 4. Safdie admitted that the name \"Habitat\" was \"Jean -Louis Lalonde's idea. It said the same thing in both languages, French and English\". It was also \"the name of the CMHC magazine that first published my thesis in Canada with which it was identified.\" See: Safdie, Beyond Habitat , 73. Safdie was , of course, familiar with the use of \"habitat\" in Team 10 discourse and had used the term in his CMHC travel scholarship report: the report \"is written from the architect's point of view as he endeavours to create 'habitat.' I use this word with its full meaning, not just a so -called 'residential environment' but the whole living being of man.\" See: Safdie, Housing in North America - 1960, Report submitted to the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation, v. Coincidently, in the very same month as Lalonde's proposal to the CCWE, the French architecture magazine Architecture d 'Aujourd'hui publish ed an issue devoted to \" Habitat\", with a cover showing the Earth composed of human figures drawn as standing together to form the continents. 125 Lalonde, \"Habitat 67: A Proposal to the Canadian World Exhibition Corporation by the Committee of Canadian Cement Companies for Expo 67 \", 6. 319 CCWE by the ce ment companies.126 Habitat 67 would, it seemed, be conditioned (in its aesthetics, social mission, and technological constraints) from the start by received modernist practices and types . This was not only to suggest sources of inspiration; it was also, es pecially in Safdie's view, to introduce Habitat 67 into contemporary architecture discourse. When it came time to announce Habitat 67 to the CCWE, Lalonde provided only two of the promised appendices to his proposal. Read together, the choices were curious. The first was a brief excerpt from the \u00e9migr\u00e9 Finnish architect Eliel Saarinen's The City: Its Growth, Its Decay, Its Future , a 1943 treatise on the future of town planning. The second comprised selections from \"Vers un urbanisme spatial\", a text in-chief of L'Architecture d'Aujourd'hui a few months before Lalonde's report.127 Saarinen's was a somewhat paranoid assessment of the modern city, explained through contrasting diagrams of \"healthy\" and \"disintegrating\" cell tissue, one evoking an ideal \"organic order\" evinced in medieval town planning and the other indicating the appearance of \"diseased\" elements in the contemporary urban core, notably slums; his panacea - his admitted \"key -word\" - cities\" by \"dispersion of the present compactness into concentrated units, such as centers, suburbs, satellite townships, and like community units; and furthermore it must aim at the organization of these units into 'functional concentrations of 126 Lalonde, \"Preparation of a preliminary study for the Committee's participation in the Canadian World Exhibition, Montreal 1967\", n.p . 127 activities.'\"128 Persitz's gave a synopsis of contemporary \"tendencies\" opposed to functionalist urbanism while offering new ways to organise city space; among the more notable were \"Cluster and Casbah \" types. Lalonde gave no reason for the inclusion of Saarinen and Perstiz, even in light of their presumable ideological differences. In fact, he abridged the texts so to suggest shared concerns: when read togeth er, they appeared as an initial but polemical programmatic statement on Habitat 67 itself. Above all, the common idea was, in terms of the Saarinen excerpt, that unlike the \"urban development\" of \"today\", which has \"mostly been dealing with matters of practical and technical nature\", the medieval city had \"resulted in expressive design and coherent order\" . 129 Lalonde thus quoted Perstiz : in medieval cities \"One does not stroll around volumes standing in space, but finds oneself inside this large scale architectural complex that is the city itself .\"130 In order to actualise this lapsed formal and spatial idea of an \"integrated whole\" - Lalonde's description of Habitat 67 - the appendix quoted Saarinen's insistence \"that the city's improvement and further 128 Eliel Saarinen, The City: Its Growth, Its Decay, Its Future (New York: Reinhold Publishing Corporation, 1943), 10, 16, 20, 23, 46, 49, 151, 200. Along with his \"cellular\" diagrams, Saarinen provided numerous conventional figure -ground p lans of historical cities. 129 Eliel Saarinen quoted in Lalonde, \"Habitat 67: A Proposal to the Canadian World Exhibition Corporation by the Committee of Canadian Cement Companies for Expo 67\", 12 . 130 Alexandre Persitz quoted in Lalonde, \"Habitat 67: A Prop osal to the Canadian World Exhibition Corporation by the Committee of Canadian Cement Companies for Expo 67\", 14, emphasis added . Lalonde excerpted Persitz's article un urbanisme spatial\" originally published in L'Architecture d'Aujourd'hui 101 (May 1962). The opposition between medieval towns and modern cities corresponded to longstanding discourse s on the loss of community with the rise of society . Lalonde argued: \"When the rate of evolution of the socio- political organization was accelerated man gradually lost control over his surroundings; and with the advent of the machine age, the economical structure of society changed so rapidly that the established pattern becomes obsolete. This is best seen in the chaos of the modern city where man is sub ordinated to the requirements of the machine which has become the main factor in determining the environment \" (5). 321 development must be started with the problems of homes and their environments\".131 Programme and type were, therefore, married and given a sphere of operation: Habitat 67, as housing, would function not only at the scale of the city but, more importantly, internalise aspects of urban social life within a singularly new and massive \"architectural complex\". Given the stated aim to offer \"case studies\", it was perhaps odd that Lalonde refrained from presenting the excerpted texts with corresponding images. This was all the more strange given Lalonde's claim that the selected texts were \"representative of present thinking\" on the question of achieving \"a total integration of the various elements of the urban complex into a coherent spatial arrangement\" (something tied, again, to \"the towns of the Middle A ges\") - Saarinen and Persitz \"tend to show\" that \"the future of the city of lies in the integration of all its components into an organized three -dimensional 'form order'.\" 132 Lalonde borrowed heavily from this notion, arguing against the \"supposedly ideal theories\" of \"two-dimensional\" modernist \"town -planning\"; opposing this kind of urbanism - emblematised by the given examples of Chandigarh and Brasilia - were theories \"town - design and town -building\" as \"physical arrangements\" in \"three -dimensions\". 133 Thi s took from Saarinen's belief that \"the town of the Middle Ages did not develop from a stylistically preconceived and fixed plan form, but from a three- dimensionally visualized picture of that 131 Eliel Saarinen quoted in Lalonde, \"Habitat 67: A Proposal to the Canadian World Exhibition Corporation by the Committee of Canadian Cement Companies for Expo 67\",12. 132 Lalonde, \"Habitat 67: A Proposal to the Canadian World Exhibition Corporation by the Committee of Canadian Cement Companies for Expo 67\", 7 . 133 Ibid., 6 . Lalonde's descriptions followed almost verbatim Saarinen 's The City: Its Growth, Its Decay, Its Future (1943): 7ff. 322 particular organism it represented.\"134 Lalonde deliberately excerpted Persitz to conclude similarly that \"modern town planning has failed, at least... under primary rules more or less derived from the Charte d'Ath\u00e8nes\": opposed to the legacy of functionalism, \"a few isolated architects in various countries\" were \"converging on a certain number of definable tendencies\" expressed in \"a tightening of the urban 'texture' in such a way that the notion of 'building' will practically disappear and be replaced by a new entity which would be, in its whole, the urban site itself.\" 135 Without any corresponding image to make readers think otherwise, Persitz's \"entity\" served to evoke what Habitat 67 could be, both formally and spatially. Indeed, as au courante readers of the Cement Companies proposal were surely aware, Persitz's title indicated exactly the kind of \"tendency\" - \"the total creation of a genuine artificial urban 'landscape'\" - he (or, rather, Lalonde) was after: the \"urbanisme spatiale \" of Yona Friedman. The original version of Persitz's article, published in L'Architecture d'Aujourd'hui , culminated in illustrations of Freidman's \"three -dimensional structure inside which are freely disposed housing elements, etc.\" and Eckhard Schulze - Fielitz's theoretical project for a \"cit\u00e9 spatiale\" as well as a cable -suspended tent co nstruction for an exhibition hall. Both Freidman and Schulze -Fielitz were members of the Groupe d'Etude d'Architecture Mobile (GEAM) and proposed enormous elevated space frames - \"town -creating spatial units\" - as means for renewing urban life far above existing cities and 134 Saarinen, The City: Its Growth, Its Decay, Its Future, 49. 135 Persitz quoted in Lalonde, \"Habitat 67: A Proposal to the Canadian World Exhibition Corporation by the Committee of Canadian Cement Companies fo r Expo 67\", 13, 16. 323 landscapes.136 Seen together by Persitz, the projects \"made it easy to imagine applying these ideas to a rough outline of the future three -dimensional city\".137 To these, Perstiz added works by the Japanese Metabolists Kenzo Tange and Arat a Isozaki (fig. 5.24). In all, it was precisely the constellation of influence admitted by Safdie. If Lalonde's two appendices were to set the terms of the still unresolved dialectic between t he limits of the existing city and the production of \"experimen tal methods\" in design and construction, then it remained just how some kind of synthesis could give rise to a world's fair pavilion . This was to be Safdie's domain . When presenting his very first memorandum on design intent to the CCWE, he hewed closely to Lalonde: The project will be a high -density, urban development, thus dealing with the most pressing housing problems of to-day. Such an approach demands the integration of housing, service, commercial, schools, etc... into one three dimensional entity. The dwelling units will be considered as \"single family houses\" piled up on top of each other, each with its own garden and entrances off streets in the air. This approach reflects the most advanced projects in this field. 138 It was an intriguing but veiled account of A Case for City Living. Given Lalonde's failure to provide any visual sources for Habitat 67, it was hardly surprising that Safdie accompanied his memorandum with an image selected from his McGill thesis: a view of System A, but quite unlike any of his student work; instead of idealised \"systems\", there suddenly appeared 136 GEAM (Groupe d'Etude d'Architecture \"Program for a Mobile Architecture\" in Ulrich Conrads, ed., Programs and Manifestoes of 20th-century Architecture (Cambridge MA: The MIT Press, 1971) , 168. GEAM was in close contact with the architect Frei Otto, whose \"hanging cities\" likely presaged Schulze - Fielitz's tent structures. Otto realised a cabled roof construction for the 1963 Hamburg International Horticultural Exhibition; it was precursor to his tensile roof structure for the German pavilion at Expo 67 . 137 Persitz, \"Vers un urbanisme spatial\", 98 published Schulze - Fielitz's \"cit\u00e9 spatiale\" in the 1962). 138 Safdie, \"Habitat 67/Permanent Housing Exhibit\", 1, emphasis added . 324 a completely occupied city, full of people, cars, and vegetation .139 The sketch was, in fact, a careful tracing from photograph of his models as published in Architecture -B\u00e2ti ment- Construction , the leading architecture journal in Quebec. The image, never attributed to the thesis project, now served only to give contour to the \"integration of housing, service commercial, schools, etc\" with \"dwelling units... considered as 'single family houses' piled on top of each other, each with its own garden and entrances off streets in the air\". This \"approach\", Safdie unduly declared, \"reflects the most advanced projects in this field\".140 As much as he focused on justifying his housing project, Safdie had also begun carefully positioning his work among - even ahead of - what he believed were commensurate avant - garde intentions in contemporary architecture Safdie's sketch suggested the major concerns of the Expo 67 housing exhibit. It gave it further definition to Friedman's \"urbanisme spatiale\" - in a sense, it made it suitable (or palatable) to the aims of a world's fair, with Safdie's echoing his student thesis and insisting that \"dwelling units will be considered as 'single family houses '\", commensurate to the tastes (and desires) of fairgoers representing the very people turning to the suburbs in hope of finding those amenities - individuality, nature - now missing in the metropolis. Moreover, the closely cropped sketch also indicated a plausible constructability. The structure was not 139 Safdie came to admit that, around the time of his memorandum, \"I was thinking singularly in terms of my thesis and had for several weeks been working on its application to the site of Mackay Pier.\" He consequently acknowledged a previous stab at self -promotion: \"It was 1962 and the planning of the New York World's Fair was well underway. One day I decided this would be the place to build my thesis; I clipped it from the pages of Forum , made a specif ic sketch showing how to build half -a-dozen houses as a pavilion, and sent it to the Portland Cement Institute in Chicago with a long letter explaining that this could be built for a limited cost as a great exhibit. They never acknowledged receipt of it.\" See: Safdie, Beyond Habitat , 73, 59. Housing Exhibit\", 1. 325 unlike scaffolding or some demountable systems suited to a temporary pavilion. Indeed, the very idea of construction seemed pressing, not least given the possible backing by an industrial concern and by the fact that no funds had been allotted by the CCWE to what was still an entirely speculative idea. Above all, the initial \"skeleton\", as Lalonde's described it, was, he and Safdie repeatedly insisted, to be \"conceived as a sector of the city\" in itself . 141 Consequently, as \"an experimental residential development \", Habitat \"would act as a laboratory for testing some of the present day thinking on living in urban areas\".142 This had been partially suggested in A Case for City Living, at least in the outward aesthetic of the novel structural system. The world's fair \"experiment\" required, however, additional criteria. The van Ginkels' had always hoped to have \"each nation... buy space or erect a structure\" within unified \"functional sections\". 143 The \"intentio n\" of Lalonde's proposal continued this ambition: it would be \"mandatory... to interest other groups in participating in the elaboration of the total project\", for which they will \"study individual problems... required for a comprehensive scheme.\" 144 Under the \"membrane\" of housing - that is, inside the pyramid - numerous public institutions were to be built by various nations. In this \"live demonstration\", \"one country would take the school, another the medical clinic, a third the 141 Ibid., 4 . 142 Lalonde, \"Preparation of a preliminary study for the Committee's participation in the Canadian W orld Exhibition, Montreal 1967\", n.p., emphasis add ed. 143 Daniel van Ginkel, Blanche van Ginke l, et al., \"1967 Folder 005, Fonds Gilles Gagnon, Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal. 144 Lalonde, \"Preparation of a preliminary study for the C ommittee's participation in the Canadian Wo rld Exhibition, Montreal 1967\", n.p., emphasis added. 326 theatre, all as permanent buildings.\"145 The ensemble would be rendered complete by \"temporary residents\", namely \"the foreign technicians working on the many national exhibits\" .146 By gathering international cultural and scientific agencies, the housing exhibit was to become a nucleus for global interdisciplinary exchange via modern architecture. With housing as theme , the very idea of a temporary pavilion - the singular demand of the Bureau International des Expositions when commissioning a world's fair - was quickly diminished. The \"permanent\" ne ed for Habitat 67 was tied to its \"experimental\" or, indeed, diagnostic, function - that is, to communicate how mass housing could normalise space relations between peoples and institutions , thereby serving as a public \"good\". This had been crucial to the command issued by the Montebello Conference: to \"examine the behaviour of man in his environment\", especially as \"man\" could \"impose on the world of 1967 new concepts of community life\". 147 It led to Safdie's demand for \"a team of architects to design a total integrated complex \".148 While this surely reaffirmed the earliest ambition of the CCWE designers to house the fair wit hin a singularly massive pavilion, it was equally an 145 Safdie, Beyond Habitat , 74. As part of the plan to have local participants develop \"schools, churches, recreational centres, etc.\" within Man and the City, Lalonde noted meetings with Montreal Catholic School Commission and the office of Paul G\u00e9rin- Lajoie, the provincial Minister of Youth (and soon the Minister of Education); s ee: Lalonde, \"Preparation of a preliminary study for the Committee's participation in the Canadian World Exhibition, Montreal 1967\", n.p . 146 Lalonde, \"Preparation of a preliminary study for the Committee's participation in the Canadian World Exhibition, Montreal 1967\", n.p . 147 \"The Theme 'Terre des Hommes' and its Development at the C anadian World Exhibition in Montreal, 1967\", Report of the Montebello Conference (May 1963): 1, Box 39- 1990- 07, Folder 001, Gilles Gagnon Archive, Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal. The question of human \"imposition\" on the material and social wo rld indicated the prophetic (and prognostic) value assigned to the Expo 67 theme. 148 Safdie, \"Habitat 67/Permanent Housing Exhibit\", 2- 3, emphasis added . 327 appeal for a greater fraternal project, one in which world architectu ral production would be parsed amongst the most representative artistic, cultural, or scientific institutions of participating nations; together, they provided, as a future report on the pavilion insisted, the \"Universal Requirements for 'Community'\", cond itions \"necessary for the transmission of communities' skills and cultural heritage\", \"for the reproduction of community members\", and \"for the integration and association of members of the 'community'.\"149 These \"universal requirements\" differed from the \" unique circumstances of each civilisation\" - broadly understood as \"Historical\" - such as \"ethical and moral values\" or \"religious and political structure\". 150 In this early conceptual phase, then, Habitat 67 was presumed liberated from the typical function of pavilion - that is, to present things in stasis or to be a summation of human history; rather, the very notion of housing, with its sense of diurnal life, presumed a place in a constant state of flux. Hence the intention to build only a portion of the pavilion for Expo 67 - any completion using an \" additive \" architecture rested on identifying future needs arising from engaging the existing city, circa 1967. *** Habitat 67 was believed to be imbued with the total consequence of a city itself . Its inhab itants would be the fair employees; its citizens would be the crowds and pleasure - seekers thronging the pavilion itself. This was in marked contrast to earlier exhibitions, which had sought to explain, often dramatically, the city of the future in miniatu re - a vision 149 Oscar Newman, \"Preliminary Study into the Form, Content and Implementation of the Theme Exhibit 'Man and Community'\" (Fe bruary 1964): 5, emphasis added, private c ollection of Steven Staples, Toronto. 150 Ibid. 5. 328 fantastically rendered in the moving \"bird's eye\" view of City of 1960, a massive diorama of a metropolis of skyscrapers and superhighways conceived by Norman Bel Geddes for the Futurama exhibit at the 1939 New York World's Fair (fig . 5.25). Futurama, and exhibits like it, posited ideal scenarios of the future, one in which peoples and technologies had achieved a kind of spatial and social equilibrium. Habitat could not, however, be the projection of a settled state simply because it had to contend with the transformation of Montreal itself. Architects, bureaucrats, planners, and politicians had already aspired to make Montreal a city of 5,000,000 people by the year 2000 - an operation tied to the infrastructural planning of Expo 67, which h elped accelerate the creation of massive new networks such as the new Metro system (opened in 1966) and the burgeoning autoroutes criss-crossing the city. 151 Against this millennial ambition, Habitat was assuredly modest. Yet Safdie's insistence on placing Habitat 67 along Mackay Pier, on landfall opposite the fairground islands, was to ensure that it outlived the fair. The housing exhibit \"should be able to expand with need after 1967\" and become \"an integral part of the City of Montreal.\" 152 In fact , among the fundamental principles outlined at the Montebello Conference was an insistence on \"the City skyline as a backdrop\", which \"has all the 151 Contemporaneous accounts link ed the infrastructural development of Montreal to the impetus of Expo 67. See: Charles Lazaeus, \"Influx of Visitors: World's Fair here Likely to Affect Automobile Planning\" The Montreal Star (December 7, 1962): 25; Brian Upton, \"World's Fair Will Spur Quebec Road Program\", The Montreal Star (December 13, 1962): 61. 152 Safdie, \"Habitat 67/Permanent Housing Exhibit\" , . 329 identification value necessary\" and therefore \"no artificial symbol would be as original and magnificent.\"153 The sta tement stood to guard against bombast and monumentality. Several months before Montebello, Safdie had closed his Meadowvale sketchbook with a drawing of megastructural import. From a massive \"system\" of inverted chevron frames were hanging tension cable s supporting countless floor plates (fig . 5.26). 154 Recalling perhaps Tange's Tokyo Bay proposal, the design advanced an extreme version of the pyramidal solutions being developed throughout the sketchbook. While Safdie's drawings were typically diagrammatic , the new v iew showed something different: the Montreal skyline . Th e sketch, redolent of the most visionary works of the era, revealed how Habitat 67 was be seen as mediating city and fair. In its infancy, Habitat 67, a \"Permanent Housing Exhibit\" devo ted to \" Man in the City \", was to be nothing less that a work of urbanism. All that remained was exactly how it could be built. 153 \"The Theme 'Terre des Hommes' and its Development at the Canadian World Exhibition in Montreal, 1967\", 3.

In keeping with his ideas from A Case for City Living , Safdie noted: \"because it is a tension system and because eac h vertical tower must be 'balanced' - the system is a 'whole' unity.\" 330 Chapter 6: Housing the World, 2 I'm buried deep in mass production You're not nothing new Iggy Pop, \"Mass Production\" (1977) When the Expo 67 m aster p lan was approved by the Canadian government on December 20, 1963, Habitat 67 automatically became an offi cial part of the world's fair. As a \"prototype\", it followed a lineage of modern housing exhibitions - the urgency of reform (or the paternal capitalis m) promoted in William Lever's Port Sunlight completed in 1914; the modernist polemic on salubrity (and internationalism) advanced in Mies van der Rohe's organisation of the Stuttgart Weissenhof seidling in 1927; the vision on mass society (or the postwar triumphalism) seen in the van Ginkels ' preferred example of the Berlin Interbau of 1957 - used to promote new visions of social life and urban space. In each instance, housing promise d modernisation. In the extended modernist imaginary , in the possible recuperation of some avant -garde sentiment, the original declaration on Weissenhof may well have been echoed by Safdie fifty years later: We live in an age of reorientation. In politics and in economics, new paths must be sought if we are to answer the challenges of the present day.... As it is in general, so it is in the specialised field of home building.... Equally important for the reorganisation of housing is the transformation of the technical basis of building through the use of new constructional systems and new materials.... A systematic approach to the New Home, and all associated organisational, spatial, constructional, technical and hygienic problems, is the basis of the planned Werkbund exhibition.... This exhibition... will address itself to the broad masses of our people. It is probably the first building and housing exhibition to be based on a productiv e principle: it wastes no money on useless exhibition buildings but makes its own 331 contribution, through building of the Weissenhofsiedlung, to the amelioration of the housing crisis and thus serves the public interest.1 In defining its enclave, the Weissenhofsiedlung was set in opposition to the divertissement world's fairs and the \"waste\" of competition pavilions. Indeed, when considering real or manufactured \"crisis\", twentieth -century expositions had typically shown spectacular visions on the future ci ty or retreated to fantasies of the \"home of tomorrow\". This was, of course, their function: to prognosticate the future, thus to naturalise the public to advanced technology. Like the exemplary modernist works at Stuttgart, designed by Le Corbusier, Wa lter Gropius, Mies van der Rohe, among others, Habitat 67 was meant to be seen \"live\". In contrast to its surroundings, it would offer an alternative to an existing social life. As such, the direct experience of industrially -built dwellings (with prefabr icated components) offering a salubrious environment was aimed at authenticating the moral imperative of the world's fair itself. Unlike the Weissenhofseidling or Interbau, the social context of Expo 67 was only the world's fair itself - an entirely artif icial and ephemeral environment. Yet it was this exceptional status that lent Habitat 67 its authority: in articles, communiqu\u00e9s, and speeches, Moshe Safdie and the Canadian Corporation for the World Exhibition (CCWE) consistently linked the prototypical status of the housing exhibit to the fact that Expo 67 granted, as a cultural body, a superior form of credit: only under a financial arrangement outside of the marketplace could an \"experiment\" in housing be erected, displayed, and 1 Peter Bruckmann, van der 1926), in Karin Kirsch, The Weissenhofsiedlung: Experimental Housing Built for the Deutscher Werkbund, Stuttgart, 1927 (New York: Rizzoli, 1989), 195-196. 332 consumed. This was, in part, its properly utopian vocation - namely, somehow to fix the future in the terms of the present. Yet just how the housing exhibit would be financed - thus built - remained uncertain. Moshe Safdie had, in the company of Jean -Louis Lalonde, the architect liaison to the Committee of Cement Companies, approached the Central Housing and Mortgage Corporation (CMHC) for further assistance. Safdie's 1959 CMHC student travelling scholarship brought him in the ambit of Canadian housing policy, which, with the 1964 National Housing Act, began confronting the demands of \"urban renewal\". 2 While committed in principle to Safdie's project, CMHC balked at funding; instead, it directed Safdie to Community Development Consultants, Toronto -based developers who had realised Flemingdon Park, a housing project much hailed in Canadian architecture circles. The developers agreed to participate in preparing a feasibility study tackling all aspects of the project, from design and construction methods to cost estimates and the marketability of the scheme. The report was sponsored by the Committee of Canadian Cement Companies and submitted to the CCWE by late February 1964. The feasibility study was coded throughout in Safdie's terminology. It was largely boilerplate, repeatin g ideas taken from his student thesis and already advanced in the CMHC journal Habitat. Nevertheless, the study was decisive for one remarkable reason: it brought 2 CMHC grapple d fitfully with urban renewal. W hen considering the 1964 National Housing Act , the CMHC Advisory Committee, which made policy recommendations, suggested basing urban renewal on helping the poor - for example, via 100 percent loan guarantees or creating local non- profit agencies to alleviate the burden of federally funded social housing. The ideas were ultimately rejected by the CMHC board, which was seen as tied to corporate interests. See: John C. Bacher, Keeping to the Marketpl ace: The Evolution of Canadian Housing Policy (Montreal and Kingston ON: McGill -Queen's University Press, 1993) , 213-214. 333 to bear the constraints of structural and financial analysis, out of which the earliest polemic of \"growth and change\" would shift from the social need of \"Man in the City\" to the technological desire for a \"system\" of industrialised building. Habitat 67 was to be permanent , outliving Expo 67 and spurring Montreal's growth. 3 As such, and in the short - lived spaces of a world's fair, the actual construction was to take on the demands of spectacle . BOXES Following Daniel van Ginkel's resignation as chief planner along with the official approval of Habitat 67, Safdie established an office at the be hest of the CCWE, which required all pavilions to be designed by independent architects. The first detailed elaboration of Habitat 67, quickly advanced in early 1964, found his student thesis project reimagined as in massive pyramidal forms. Rarely forge tting Kenzo Tange's Tokyo Bay plan, drawing on Team 10 concepts, and returning to his studies for the van Ginkels' Meadowvale new town, Safdie presented an enormous sloping \"membrane\" of terraced \"houses\" (fig. 6.1). Drawings and models showed \"rhomboid p lanes inclined at 60 \u00b0 to the horizontal\" sheltering public areas below, including an exhibition of \"Man and the City\" in which different nations were to build the social infrastructure (schools, clinics) supporting Habitat 67. Huge A -frame \"edge 3 As much as the early designs of Habitat 67 were always \"dependent... on the downtown core, on other interdependent development\" , the project was also to be the \"nucleus\" of something far greater: a \"program for dispersal\", providing \"for the integration of the urban meeting place and the open country; for agriculture and industry\", and \"supported by an evolving system of communications and transportation which unite a region into an urban entity\" . See: Moshe Safdie, Stewart Andrews et al., \"Combined Report Covering the Schematic Design, Development and Economical Aspects of the Proposed Permanent Housing Exhibit Habitat 67\" (February 21 , 1964): n.p., Box PF3, Moshe Safdie Archive, Canadian Architecture Collection, McGill University. 334 members\" enclosing elevator tubes connected to \"streets\" giving access to the rhythmically arranged units, each with its own garden (fig. 6.2). Two phases - one 22 -storey, the other 12-storey - were to be built along Mackay Pier.4 The scheme was to house 5,000 inhabitants in 1,000 dwellings (a clear reflection of the nuclear family as the measure of postwar Canadian society). While \"dependent... on the downtown core, on other interdependent development\", the project was really the \"nucleus\" of something far greater : a \"program for dispersal\", providing \"for the integration of the urban meeting place and the open country; for agriculture and industry\", and \"supported by an evolving system of communications and transportation which unite a region into an urban entity\" . 5 Safdie's project - a heroic avant-propos to a world's fair still without architecture - quickly circulated in international magazines, its forms read in sympathy with nascent discourses on megastructures. Its eventual realisation (as an entirely diffe rent structure) would be measured against these initial efforts. As he undertook the first feasibility study on Habitat 67, while remaining committed to achieving an utterly unique urban form, Safdie's ambition was necessarily tempered by a new and increas ing preoccupation. Still concerned by themes on \"growth\", he turned his attention to the actual fabrication of dwelling units. A Case for City Living had necessitated the need \"to establish a repetitive modular element\", that correspondingly demanded som e form of mass production. Now, in February 1964, as Safdie worked alongside real estate 4 The 22 -storey scheme included a hotel with a similar pyramidal massing. 5 Safdie, Andrews et al., \"Combined Report Covering the Schematic Design, Develop ment and Economical Aspects of the Proposed Permanent Housing Exhibit Habitat 67\", n.p . 335 developers on the first feasibility study, the idea of serialised industrial production became increasingly pressing: \"The economics to be gained by standardization - reduced labour costs, efficient use of materials - have architectural implications.\" Habitat 67 consequently \"attempts to provide an entire range of dwellings using mass -produced units. It strives for long range economics by minimizing manual labour in production.\" 6 While the theory owed to Safdie, the technical focus came from the consulting engineer, August Komendant. Safdie had encountered Komendant while working for Louis Kahn. Among other works, Komendant contributed the innovative Vierendel trus s system used by Kahn at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, then under construction in La Jolla, California. Safdie invited the engineer to work on Habitat given its \"structurally demanding\" design that necessitated \"expert structural consultation \". 7 Komendant immediately made three crucial decisions: first, \"the individual housing units should be manufactured as precast concrete mass products\"; second, the units \"are jointed together and to the bridging streets by a simple tensioning procedure\" using \"threaded bars\", thus making the units load bearing; third, \"the housing units would be pre -fabricated at a location adjacent to the construction site, transported to the site on rubber tired low -bed trailers, lifted into position by crane and 6 Ibid, n.p . 7 Moshe Safdie, Letter to August Komendant 7, 1964): 1, Box PF11, Folder 58/100/PF4/13, Moshe Safdie Archive, Canadian Architecture Collection, McGill University. Safdie did not solicit other structural engineers. Komendant work ed only in a consulting capacity, with drawings prepared by the Montreal firm Monti, Lefebvre, Lavoie, Nadon and Associates. 336 post-tensioned together to form a rigid unit.\"8 While Komendant addressed the viability of construction, his remarks suggested an increasingly important aspect of Habitat 67: in the popular, public display of constructability, the building process would be as important as the finished form itself, perhaps even more so. The very ethos of Expo 67 was bound to the promotion of Habitat 67 as a prototype. As the CMHC president put it, the project \"should be bold and imaginative, creating a construction which shoul d lead to progressive steps toward the development of new ideas in the field of the residential building industry.\"9 With even more emphasis, Robert Shaw, the Deputy Commissioner of the CCWE, considered Habitat to be \"a meaningful symbol... the first such symbol since the Eiffel tower taught the world how to design and build sky scrapers in 1889.\" 10 Regardless of Shaw's historical inaccuracy, if some elevated cultural status was actually granted by the didactic function of an innovative structural system, th en this was further ensured by the promise of capital outlay existing outside marketplace demands. \"Habitat 67 is a prototype\", the Expo 67 Press Service would later announce, \"and 8Safdie, Andrews et al., \"Combined Report Covering the Schematic Design, Development and Economical Aspects of the Proposed Permanent Housing Exhibit Habitat 67\", n.p . Komendant insisted on the use of concrete over competing interests on steel or aluminium, especially since that metals require s \"all the way moment connections, rather heavy sections (torsion) and columns (under each street) to transmit the vertical loads directly to the foundations.\" See: Komendant, Letter to Moshe Safdie (April 11, 1964): 1, Box PF11, Folder 58/100/PF4/6, Moshe Saf die Archive, Canadian Architecture Collection, McGill University. 9 Stewart Bates quoted in A.A.

Shaw, Letter to the Hon. Mitchell Sharp, Minister of Trade and Commerce (September 16, 1964): 1, Box PF9, Folder 58/100/PF3/2, Moshe Safdie Archive, Canadian Architecture Collection, McGill University. Shaw echoed the breathless assessment of Time magazine (June 19, 1964): \"They call it 'the soul, the genius' of the Fair, and suggest that, as symbols go, it will make the Eiffel Tower seem a collection of girders leading up to a hot -dog stand.\" 337 consequently the cost... is appreciably higher than once the system of fabrication is perfected\".11 The architects within the CCWE had similarly decided: It has been suggested that an investment over and above the economic value of the Habitat 67 is unjustified when compared to directly subsidized low cost housing. The aims of tw o such projects are diametrically opposed.... Habitat 67 represents an experiment in housing. An experiment by its nature cannot justify financial support on the same terms as a proven answer to a specific problem as in the case of subsidized low cost hous ing. The potential benefits to be gained from the realization of Habitat are so far reaching as to be impossible to assess in terms of dollars. Any gain from subsidizing low cost housing is immediate in terms of social assistance but never produces a fin ancial return. Therefore, Habitat 67 is conceived with basically three aims: a) to meet the challenge of urban housing in our expanding cities b) to research new construction methods and techniques for benefit to the entire building industry c) to demonstrate the catalystic ability of a new solution such as Habitat to revitalize the environment and influence urban development. 12 Notwithstanding the argument for its \"catalystic ability\", the concept of Habitat had begun to shift largely along the lines of the latter two \"aims\": \"Irrespective of the result of the Habitat social experiment\", the CCWE concluded, \"the construction industry will draw immense benefit from research into the new building methods and techniques explored.\" 13 11 Expo 67 Press Service, \"H abitat Project Gets Green Light\" (April 8, 1965): 2, Box PF9, Folder 58/100/PF3/16, Moshe Safdie Archive, Canadian Architecture Collection, McGill University. 12 A.A.

To Safdie, the housing project was nothing less than a \"laboratory for build ing techniques\" that enabled \"the manufacturing and construction industry to explore new methods.\" The impression appeared shared by concrete industries around the world; see, for example: Silvano Cemento (October 1967); \"Habitat 67 - Hacia el 338 In a sense, this kept with a much l onger march through the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries toward addressing the \"housing question\" by solving its technical means of production ahead of actual realisation.14 Indeed, the correspondence between industrial manufacture and housing stemmed from the need to design interchangeable parts - a precept of Fordism that had influenced the Modern Movement and had latent significance in Safdie's ceaseless call throughout the 1960s: \"We must adopt the manufacturing methods of automobiles, aircraft and appliances to building\". 15 By doing so, it would be \"possible to recover monies spent on research through the resultant opening of future markets.\"16 Habitat 67 was no longer to be only a project of social engineering, regardless of the \"hard\" Desarrollo de un Sistema Constructivo\", Revista del Concreto (May 1967); \"Habitat 67\", Concrete Quarterly (Cement and Concrete Association, Lond on, July 1966). The Prestressed Concrete Institute, based in Chicago, would, as part of 1967 PCI Awards, grant \"full recognition to Habitat 67 for its tremendous importance as a research experiment\"; see: \"Winners 1967 PCI Awards\", Journal of the Prestressed Concrete Institute (August 1967): 66 -75. 14 If an indictment of the modern city lay in Friedrich Engels's tirade against insalubrity (as witnessed in Manchester), then a certain solution was soon found in theories of management - whether of workers or materials - espoused by the likes of F.W. Taylor and Henry Ford. Technocratic control, the theory went, could supersede the divisiveness of politics and usher an age of mass production remedying even the most calamitous conditions of urban blight. This c ontributed to even more futuristic ideals, with a sense of techno - science as spurring utopia - notably captured in Thorstein Veblen's idea of a \"Soviet of Technician s\". Different tangents of the modern m ovement would be seduced by the ambitions of Taylorism. Le Corbusier responded favourably to Taylor's vision of \"Scientific Management\" as panacea to reconstruction in France following the First World War; see: Mary McLeod, \"'Architecture or Revolution': Taylorism, Technocracy, and Social Change\", Art Jour nal Vol. 43, No. 2 (Summer 1983): 132- 147. 15 Moshe Safdie, \"Why not Utopia?\", in Symposium on Changing Concepts Human Habitations (Roorkee, India: Nem Chand & Bros, 1966): 10.

The privileged status of \"experiment\" or \"research\" and the consequent design of a \"prototype\" suggested a potential cleavage between the socio-technical project symbolised by Habitat 67 and the prevailing market conditions determining its realisation. By the mid - 1960s, the Canadian government noted three impending and interrelated phenomena: the nation faced \"an acute housing need\"; \"there has been a definite trend toward apartment living in Canada, which has been the chief market for industrialised building\" elsewhere; and \"North America is the only continent in the world where industrialised building has not been used to any extent yet\". 17 These observations were the context of the Report of the Canadian Technical Mission on Prefabricated Concrete Components in Industrialized Building in Europe commissioned by the Materials Branch of the Department of Industry, a government ministry, in September 1966; in noted: \"industrialised building in Canada for the housing market will have to be developed\" by \"a group that will have the ability to acquire land, develop it, and finance production facilities, and take care of subsequent erection and completion of buildings, along much the same lines as the conventional builders 17 P. Eug\u00e8ne Marchand, Report of the Canadian Technical Mission on Prefabricated Concrete Components in Industrialized Building in Europe, September 2 -22, 1966 (Ottawa: Materials Branch, Department of Industry, 1966 ), 26-27. The Canadian Department of Industry become deeply invested in exploring the rise of industrialised and how it could affect building practices in Canada. Marchand's report was followed by two related studies: D.G. Laplante, Report of the Canadia n Technical Mission on Prefabricated Steel Components in Industrialized Building in Europe, June 1967 (Ottawa: Materials Branch, Department of Industry, 1967) and John A.

Yet the total cost of Habitat - based on \"careful scrutiny of new construction methods and materials which will provide a substantial contribution to the housing market of the future\"19 - was, with the tabling of the feasibility study, projected at $42 million, with a $22 million market value set by rents targeted to an \"upper and middle income group\", thereby resulting in a $20,000,000 million shortfall. To Safdie, this premium - which enabled the \"new techniques\" - \"must be paid in the first application\". 20 In other words, research and design were to be ensured outside and ahead of any economic self -interest. \"All of these costs will not be incurred after the method is applied in the future and perfected\", Safdie insisted while maintaining a typically prophetic tenor: \"To build economically is a social and political aspect of our time\".21 The CCWE thus began trying to interest private industry \"to participate in\" - that is, to finance - \"Habitat 67 for the purpose of developing new methods of construction and building 18 Marchand, Report of the Canadian Technical Mission on Prefabricated Concrete Components in Industrialized Building in Europe, September 2- 22, 1966, 26-27. 19 Safdie, Andrews et al., \"Combined Report Covering the Schematic Design, Development and Economical Aspects of the Proposed Permanent Housing Exhibit Habitat 67\", n.p . 20 Moshe Safdie, \"Revolution in Housing\", Lecture at Univer sity of Western Ontario (January 16, 1965): 11, Box PF20, Folder 58/100/PF12/1, Moshe Safdie Archive, Canadian Architecture Collection, McGill University. 21 Ibid; Safdie, Andrews et al., \"Combined Report Covering the Schematic Design, Development and Econ omical Aspects of the Proposed Permanent Housing Exhibit Habitat 67\", n.p .

For Habitat, this was hopefully the provision of tooling -up and plant facilities. 22 Consequently, in late May 1964, Safdie gave a slideshow to heads of industrial concerns meeting on Ile Sainte -H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and claimed: \"We have evolved a mass production method in which assembly line techniques now commonly used in the aircraft or automobile industry are applied to construction generally, and to housing specifically. Habitat offers a setting for the Canadian building industry to exercise its ingenuity and skill.\" 23 No mention was made of exactly which industries could participate on specific aspects of the project, but as newspapers quickly put it after Safdie's pitch: \"For Habitat 67 - so far - no takers.\" 24 The Canadian government - the majority stakeholder in the fair - took a similar position. Several months after the CCWE presentatio n to industry, Safdie, backed by the Expo authorities, delivered a speech to the minister in charge of Expo 67 and claimed that the 22 Safdie's belief in the state sponsorship of architectural \"research\" grew out of his CMHC -sponsored student travel, after which he concluded that \"it is felt by many in the building ind ustry that the initiative must come from governments who must set up a series of pilot projects and studies (by universities) that would be picked up by the industry.\" In the Canadian context, \"it would be advisable if the various 'atelier'\" in CMHC \"unde rtook experimental projects periodically.\" See: Safdie, Housing in North America - 1960, Report submitted to the Central Mortgage and Hou sing Corporation (1960), 22, 37. 23 \"Presentation of Habitat 67 by Mr Moshe Safdie, Commissioned Architect of the Building, to Member Attending Symposium at St Helen's Island, May 29, 1964\", Canadian Corporation for the World Exhibition Fonds, RG71, Vol. 445, Library and Archives Canada, Ottawa. According to local reports, the event was \"a sneak preview of a unique model community\" for \"some 200 leading Canadian businessmen\". See: Hans Grottke, \"Model Community Previewed\", The Montreal Gazette (May 30, 1964). 24 Lee Belland, \"Expo's 'Hanging' apartments, costly exhibits\", Toronto Daily Star (June 2, 1964). The article stated that Habitat \"is not considered in the private sector but officials would like to see it built by private effort.\" 342 \"excess costs\" of the pyramid scheme were \"due to the proto- type nature of project.\"25 Two months later, the government categorically refused to allow financing by a tax deduction for research, worried that this would set an unacceptable precedent enabling builders to claim exemptions from things like building codes; instead, it offered a total package of $11.5 million dollars.26 The new budget resulted in crucial changes to Habitat 67: a greatly diminished version of the project, the elimination of the Man in the City exhibition (it would soon have its own theme pavilion designed by Arthur Erickson), and the fact that the CCWE would not only undertake construction but own outright the project. In late 1964, only six months before the foreseen driving of foundation piles, and facing new budgetary limits, Habitat 67 began to be entirely rethought. Obliged drastically to reduce the project, Safdie redesigned Habitat between November 1964 and April 1965. This became the scheme as realised (fig. 6.3). Two important changes ensued: a repositioning on the site and, far more significantly, an entirely 25 Moshe Safdie, \"Habitat 67 Introduction\" (September 5, 1964), Box PF9, Folder 58/100/PF3/2, Moshe Safdie Archive, Canadian Architectu re Collection, McGill University. Safdie argued for covering construction costs by \"donations from industry\", the \"classification of the project as research\", and \"various forms of depreciation\". Among the important mentions of Habitat 67 as \"prototype\" was a letter by Robert Shaw, Deputy Commissioner of Expo 67, to Mitchell Sharp, the Canadian Minister of Trade and Commerce and the government appointee in charge of the fair. Shaw accounted for the \"excess costs\" of Habitat \"over economic value\" due to \"the fact that this is a prototype\" ; written one day after Safdie's presentation to Sharp and other ministers , Shaw's letter reproduced the architect's reasons. See: R. F. Shaw, Letter to the Hon. Mitchell Sharp (September 16, 1964): 3, Box PF9, Folder 58/100/PF3/2, Moshe Safdie Archive, Canadian Architecture Collection, McGill University. 26 Safdie, Beyond Habitat , 88-90. Safdie recounts that a handful of large industrial concerns were interested in financing the original version of Habitat 67 but only if they could exploit a formula similar to that for underwriting ship -building in Canada, which allowed corporations to build ships, sell them on the international market, and claim the difference as a tax write -off. The Government ultimately decided not to make an exemption for Habitat on these terms. 343 new form. Tellingly, the Expo a uthorities would now call it \"Habitat 67 - Phase 1\".27 The winnowing mandate was to be compensated by a future completion. Safdie shifted the entire ensemble to the tip of Mackay Pier. Views were afforded over the St Lawrence River or towards the city sky line. Instead of the sheltered \"meeting place\" of the first proposal, Habitat now rested on a continuous raised podium for unimpeded pedestrian circulation and open to the elements. Underneath this \"public space\" was an entirely separate level for service roads and parking facilities. 28 This followed a long- held modernist belief: that circulation - here premised on the elevated \"horizontal street\" - could both liberate people from machines - literally, by lifting them above world - and unite them in the e xperience of a newly ordered city. The first efforts on the master plan by Safdie, Ad\u00e8le Naud\u00e9, and others were couched in this logic. Nevertheless, this was the final obviation of Man in the City - the fairgoer was no longer promised the experience of a full \"integration\" of social and technical systems, whether schools or transit lines, inside the pavilion -cum -city. The winnowing of budget brought a shrinking of architecture. Gone were the inclined rhomboid \"membranes\" and the A -frame supports. Inste ad, 354 precast concrete modular units, each measuring 17\u00bd by 38\u00bd by 10 feet (roughly a 1:2:4 proportion) and 27 As a critique following the opening of Expo 67 noted, the revised Habitat plan \"has been named Phase 1 of what is hoped to be a total involvement of building and planning in a modern society.\" See: Hans El te, \"Habitat 67: The Critical Eye 2\", Canadian Architect (October 1967): 36. 28 Safdie continued referring to the pedestrian podium as a \"public space\" well after Expo 67 - even when photographs showed very little evidence of fledging social life. See: Moshe Safdie, For Everyone a Garden (Cambridge MA: The MIT Press, 1974): 70 -71. 344 weighing 70 to 90 tons, were arranged to produce a twelve-storey structure with fifteen different house types of one- to four -bedrooms, comprising 158 dwellings, some on multiple levels (fig. 6.4). Three vertical cores contained elevators stopping every four floors at a horizontal \"pedestrian street\" giving access to residences as well as carrying mechanical services. Like Komendant's first scheme , the new project was also a \"three-dimensional space structure\". The units were load -bearing, connected to one another by bolting and post - tensioning; a portion of the loads was transferred to the horizontal streets, which were in effect ten-foot high gi rders, and down along the vertical cores. All elements - the cores, walkways, and units - were to be precast. The placement of the vertical post -tension cables at midpoint and slightly inboard of the end of the exterior walls of each unit enabled their stacking at right angles (fig. 6.5). 29 The resulting cantilever provided a roof garden above the adjacent apartment. The units were organised symmetrically about the vertical cores, resulting in ziggurat profiles. Yet viewed obliquely, as most visitors finally saw it, Habitat 67 would exhibit a crenulated, almost haphazard massing, redolent of the vernacular types admired by Safdie. Here were, it was hoped, the ultimate aesthetics and technics of the sought -after \"cluster\" geometry. ECONOMIES 29 To allow stacked boxes, all bearing points were provided with steel plates and neoprene pads. The concrete units were cast with lower and upper beams. 345 The construction drawings for Habitat 67 were completed by April 1965. \"Habitat Project Gets Green Light\", the Expo Press Service declared, marking the completion of almost 250 architectural working drawings. 30 The CCWE made the call for tender. While Habitat 67 wa s substantially reduced, the CCWE promised that there was room to grow. Its Press Service announced: \"Habitat - Phase 1 forms but a portion of the originally conceived development. Not all the community facilities provided for in the original concept will be built by 1967, but it is planned that these would be added as Mackay Pier is developed in the future.\" 31 Among Safdie's early successes was convincing the City of Montreal to rezone Mackay Pier from industrial to residential and commercial use, a mano euver tied to the belief that the housing would continue to expand along with new and growing services. Even during construction, Safdie would carry on designing social programmes for the future complex, including a commercial centre located at the southe rn edge of the site \"to become a link with future Habitats.\" 32 Extending the pedestrian podium, 30 Expo 67 Press Servic e, \"Habitat Project Gets Green Light\" (April 8, 1965), 2 . \"There were two hundred and fifty architectural working drawings in the final set\", Safdie would note, and \"at least an equal number of structural, mechanical, and electrical construction drawings; thousands of shop drawings; innumerable design sketches and studies.\" See: Safdie, Beyond Habitat , 97. Safdie's associated architects were the Montreal firm David, Barott, Boulva. The tendering pr ocess for Habitat 67 was unique. C omplete working drawin gs were not given to contractors. Instead, Safdie's team relied on general drawings and specifications that \"outlined in broad terms the requirements of the design and called for proposals which were to be technically developed in collaboration with the d esign team. A budget was established on the basis of conventional equipment and industry was encouraged to participate in the cost of develo pment of new products.\" A fter sending the project to bid, Safdie felt assured that \"Habitat 67 is proving to be a research project\". See: \"Habitat 67\", Habitat (Ottawa, September -5. 31 Expo 67 Press Service, \"Expo 67 to Build Habitat\" (April 8, 1965): n.p., Box PF9, Folder 58/100/PF3/16, Moshe Safdie Archive, Canadian Architecture Collection, McGill University. 32 Safdie, For Everyone a Garden , 82. 346 the centre was composed of units similar to the housing modules \"making it possible to construct it with the output of the Habitat factory\".33) Stacked in like fashion but only up to two storeys, and with modified roofs that appeared to open while lifting a glazed canopy that served as the shop fa\u00e7ade, the overall impression was that of a zouk (fig. 6.6). Unlike the heavier masses of the Habitat housing cells, with their punched openings, the commercial centre gave the impression of a lightweight system - an effect accentuated by the controlled thinness of the cardboard and acrylic models. The scheme remained unrealised. After Expo, Habitat was given a convenie nce store in the garage. For the CCWE, the very look of Habitat 67 conferred cultural value. Meeting in late autumn 1965, the Expo 67 Advisory Committee on Architecture \"unanimously agreed\" that \"the project Habitat should be better explained to the publ ic and that an elaborated presentation should be prepared in order that the said project be fully understood in depth.\" The CCWE Public Relations branch started to enlist the committee architects to act as \"Friends of Expo\" and to deliver a stock speech, accompanied by slides, in \"every nook and cranny in \"get EXPO's message across\". 34 Habitat would be promoted as \"probably the most ambitious single exhibit in the whole exhibition\" - a status resting on the belief that \"new building techniques may be developed from the 33 Ibid. The idea of manufacturing the commercial centre in the on -site factory underscored Safdie's belief in mass production, especially given its two typical constraints: first, components must be utilisable for buildings with different functions - hence Safdie's idea that the basic unit could be modified for the proposed commercial centre; second, components must serve various purposes - for example, as both wall and roof. 34 Patrick MacAdam, Canadian Corporation for the 1967 World Exhibition Public Relations Branch, Letter to John C. Parkin, Chairman, Advisory Committee on Architecture (June 15, 1966), Box 18 -97-009, John Parkin Archive, Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal. 347 construction of this complex and lead to the saving of manpower in the future.\"35 Technics now began to take on a properly social vocation: on the one hand, the forming of popular taste, within the spectacle of a world's fair, for industrialised building; on the other hand, a long-term project for reshaping industrial relations in capitalist society. This also had aesthetic contour: soon after the completion of the original Habitat pyramidal scheme, the CCWE had begun anticipating the lasting cultural value of Expo 67 in the appearance of \"Cellular Construction\". As announced in Expo Digest , its public bulletin: According to Edouard Fiset, Expo 67's chief architect, the World Exhibition will be an opportunity to present a \"new direction\" to the architects of the world. The new departure being used at Expo is \"cellular\" construction instead of mass construction of the past. For example, the building that will house Expo displays will be flexible because cellular design allows expansion or reduction as the need presents itself. There's Habitat 67. It will be built on a relatively small area; elements will be superimposed to form a pyramid. \"This way of building, be the addition of new cells, will have repercussions throughout the whole world,\" explains Mr. Fiset. 36 While suggesting an architectural zeitgeist at the world's fair, the \"cellular\" demand allowed Safdie and the CCWE to see his work in more comparative and global terms. At the behest of the CCWE, as well as in his increasingly celebrated role as author of the coming housing \"prototype\", Safdie began to elaborate theories on \"cellular construction\". Even before the actual construction of Habitat 67, Safdie visited the Soviet Union to observe advances in large-scale prefabricated housing. In December 1965, at the invitation of the National 35 \"Basic Exp o Speech\" (May 10, 1966), Box 18- 97-009, John Parkin Archive, Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal. 36 \"'Cellular' Construction\", Expo Digest , Vol. 1, No. 20 (November 18, 1964): 1- 2. 348 Building Research Council Institute of India, he travelled to the northern Indian city of Roorkee and attended a symposium on Changing Concepts of Human Hab itations .37 Notwithstanding the conference title, and despite his work, Safdie spoke little on the question of housing. Instead, he began to elaborate a theory on design that sought, above all, to eliminate what he dismissed as the \"arbitrary\" in built fo rm - a view that underpinned the entire social and technological project for Habitat. Ostensibly in India to present Habitat 67, Safdie devoted the bulk of his paper to a more theoretical definition of the dwelling unit, or \"cell\" or \"box\". He spoke to a largely Indian audience with a smattering of international attendees.38 Safdie titled his paper \"Why Not Utopia\", a place and concept he described vaguely but sentimentally in an associated 37 A leading Montreal newspaper reported: \"the brilliant, creative design of Habitat caught the imagination of foreigners everywhere, especially in countries with serious over -population problems.... Some countries are not willing to wait until Habitat has been built, tried and proven before investigating the concept it embodies. In December 1965, at the invitation of the Indian government\" Safdie went to Roorkee \"to present a paper on his project.... 'They're interested in having me come back to do a prototype of Habitat adapted to Indian conditions once we are finished at Expo,' he said.\" See: \"Habitat Plan Evokes Controversy\", The Montreal Star (May 29, 1966): 32. Soon described his Soviet Union trip in an interview soon after completing Habitat 67; s ee: Safdie, \"Last Part of Second Session\", Interview (March 6, 1968): 18- 19, Box PF22, Moshe Safdie Archive, Canadian Architecture Collection, McGill University. Later he remarked: \"We may dislike what the Russians are building in Moscow, but it's foolish simply to dismiss it all, as professional critics do; thes e suburbs are, in fact, a realistic expression of what our present system for build ing housing is able to produce\"; s ee: Safdie, For Everyone a Garden , 3. Safdie's experience was not exclusive: the Canadian building industry was aware of Soviet advances i n prefabricated concrete construc tion in the 1960s. F or example, when the trade journal Canadian Pit and Quarterly featured the early construction stages of Habitat 67, it reminded its readers in a prefatory note: \"In the April and May issues of CPQ we described the assembly -line methods used to build apartments from precast concrete units in Russia. At the same time our Canadian building industry started the construction of an apartment project, which can be justly called the most advanced application of precast components in the world: 'Habitat 67'.\" See: \"Habitat 67, the Ultimate in Precast Concrete Construction\", Canadian Pit and Quarterly (July 1966): 32. 38 Among the notable international attendees was the town planner Co nstantin Doxiadis, whose not ion on \"ekistics\" as the \"science of human settlements\" was gaining currency in the 1960s. Safdie had cribbed Doxiadis's diagrams on Safdie, \"The Master Plan: Growth, Change, and Repetition\", (Ottawa, May -June, 1962): 4. 349 view of \"The Meeting Place\" as sketched for the original Habitat p roject: \"a city which allows man to enjoy all the extremes, from open space and wilderness to the intense enclosure and urbanity of the market and the meeting place; from the privacy of and seclusion of his house to the excitement and intercourse of the pu blic place\".39 Despite the suggestion of a talk on urbanism, Safdie turned instead to defining \"Modular Housing Systems\": In the past, we have been concerned with the design of \"independent units\" whether in rural or urban construction.... Our problem today is the grouping of elements, wholly or partially dependent on each other. The process of design must change to accommodate this. The design of dependent elements in groups is the design of building systems, the organization of units in groups in which t he relationship to each other is as significant as the design of the unit itself. 40 Safdie presented diagrams of various \"clusters\" designed breezes\", and finally to \"create a micro-climate\" - the latter effectively a city - produced \"in such a way that each [unit] finds its best place within the three dimensional whole\" (fig. 6.7). 41 The sketches illustrated what he importantly termed \"fitness of form\": \"The keyword for the architect today is not freedom but dependency\"; the architect should, therefore, strive \"to reduce the arbitrariness of the building form in 39 Safdie, \"Why not Utopia? Part 2: Proposals and Requirements\", 2. Safdie also reiterated previous statements on demographic and urban growth in Canada, described his ideas about \"Growth and Change in the Master Plan\", and decided that the only viable solution for modern urbanism was to plan comprehensively at the scale of the region - in short, his ongoing claims for \"integration\" . 40 Safdie, \"Why not Utopia?\", 6. 41 Ibid., 7, 8. Safdie continued to use these diagrams well after their initial formulation; they appeared, for example, on the cover of the Quebec architecture journal Architecture Concept (October 1974). 350 fulfilling its function as perfectly as possible\".42 Whether showing his Indian hosts A Case for City Living, the first pyramidal plans of the housing exhibit, or the ultimate design for Habitat 67, Safdie's plans, sections, and model photographs served to emphasise the \"organization of units\". Against this architectural work, Safdie juxtaposed images from an entirely different realm. Taken from t he natural sciences, they showed, among other things, a Nautilus shell, an oak leaf, and the links of a molecular chain (fig. 6.8). To Safdie, the figures spoke of \"gnomic\" or \"additive\" growth. Safdie had previously used \"gnomic growth\" to characterise the urban patterns of 1962 competition project for Tel Aviv that he had designed with the architect Anne Tyng while they worked in Louis Kahn's office. Tyng had been instrumental to an especially experimental phase in Kahn's output during the 1950s, introducing him to Buckminster Fuller's geodesics and other experimental structures, and decisively shaping the remarkable City Tower, a proposed city hall included in Kahn's unrealised Philadelphia civic centre designs. 43 The tower was a triangulated strut frame of precast and pre -stressed concrete, with a plan shaped as three combined hexagons and each level shifted so that no two adjacent floors aligned. Under Tyng's influence, Safdie was introduced \"to a book she called her bible\" - the zoologist D'Arcy Wen tworth Thompson's book On Growth and Form , originally published in 1917 but subsequently issued as a revised edition in 1942, thus influencing postwar architectural circles. \"I consumed it\", Safdie admitted. \"It was through 42 Safdie, \"Why not Utopia?\", 9. 43 Tyng's thinking on experimental structures led, for example, to the tetr ahedral concrete floor slabs of Kahn's Yale Art Gallery of 1953. 351 D'Arcy Thompson that I started understanding the nature of form.\"44 Attempting \"to invoke the aid of the physical and mathematical sciences\" to the study of natural history, Thompson's contribution lay in the correlation of biological forms and mechanical phenomena.45 In describing the shapes of living organisms by the physical forces that act upon them, he made unique contributions to the study of topology. While considering the outward appearance of \"organic Form\", he also looked into the deepest structure of things to note the forma tions and symmetries exhibited in cells and crystals at the molecular level (a task likely aided by the use of the electron microscope in the 1930s). 46 Written with literary acumen, On Growth and Form was more a treatise than a book of empirically verifiable truths (\"for indeed it is 'all preface' from beginning to end\", he admitted prefatorily). Above all, he aimed to marry \"descriptive\" and \"analytical\" approaches to the \"Comparison of Related Forms\", a task undertaken by including drawings, diagrams, an d photographs - in short, a visual if not outright aesthetic explication of formal transformations that made the work all the more palatable to architectural tastes (fig. 6.9). 47 Indeed, the appropriation of 44 Safdie, Beyond Habitat , 145. 45 D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson, On Growth and Form (New York: The Macmillan Company, 1942), 2. 46 Thompson's sense of a decidedly \"modern\" view of the penetration into things was appeared in his addition of stroboscopic photographs of milk splashes by Harold E. Edgerton of MIT to the 1942 edition of On Growth and Form . 47 Thompson, On Growth and Form , 1026. The need for bio -structural analogies, as borrowed by po stwar architects from Thompson, had long been part of the modernist imagination. As Robert Maxwell notes of England during the rise of the m odern movement: \"For the generation of young architects that were taking part in this search\" - that is, the search for \"hybrids\", of culture and technology, or of the \"new and the old\" - \"after the first world war there was one source that seemed utterly convincing: the book by D'Arcy Thompson, On Growth and Form , of 1917. Leslie Martin, former head of the Architectu re School of Cambridge University, told me that this book was viewed as gospel in his group - the group that went on the publish Circle in 1937.\" See: Maxwell, Sweet Disorder and the Carefully Careless: Theory and Criticism in Architecture (New York: 352 Thompson in aesthetic discourse was assured by t he notable exhibition Growth and Form , which opened in July 1951 at the Institute of Contemporary Art in London. Organised and designed by the artist Richard Hamilton, soon to become a member of the Independent Group, the show presented photographs, models, and films of non-art objects: enlarged x - rays of the human body, images of animal and insect musculature and tissue, models of tensile structures, all arranged as elements floating in a thin lattice frame as well as projected on the walls (fig. 6.10). 48 \"The great charm\" of the exhibition, The Architectural Review Princeton Architectural Press, 1993) , 291-292. Circle , an important compendium of European avant -garde practices for British readers, concluded with an image of the Victoria regia water lily cleverly juxtaposed with the radiating concrete structure of the arc hitect Matt\u00e9 Trucco's Fiat factory of 1923. Earlier, Joseph Paxton had apparently based the structural design of the Crystal Palace on the form of the Victoria regia , for which he had designed a hothouse in Chatsworth, completed in 1850. The aesthetic dimension of Thompson's work was central to his biological investigations. The lessons of aesthetic experience as a method to examine the matter of natural things decisively influenced Thompson's work and, late r, the Theoretical Biology Club founded at Ca mbridge University in the 1930s, and which included Conrad Waddington and Lancelot Law Whyte as members. B oth men contribute d to the postwar culture of interfaces between art and science. Just as these scientists took from aesthetics in the late- nineteen th and early -twentieth centuries, the postwar appreciation of Thompson and others reversed the trend, with architects turning to the visualisation of scientific examples as holding fundamental truths on design. See: Donna Haraway, Crystals, Fabrics, and Fields: Metaphors of Organicism in Twentieth -Century Developmental Biology (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1976). Whyte edit ed Aspects of Form: a Symposium on Form and Nature , a 1951 book that united artists and scientists on considerations of bio-mechanical aesthetics. Whyte's book influenced Safdie: \"In the world of dual thinking where good opposes evil, we tended to think of design concepts also in terms of dualities: uniformity versus randomness, rigidity versus looseness, regular versus irregular. But these dualities contradict all natural organisms and systems. They are, as Lancelot Whyte put it, in contradiction with unitary thinking. In the world of unitary thinking, we can think of the design of an object or organism simultaneously in terms of repetition and variation, system and variety, standardisation and rhythm, conformity and identity.\" See: Safdie, \"On from Habitat\", Design 226 (October 1967): 45. 48 The idea of the exhibition was originally floated by Hamilton, the photographer Nigel Henderson, and the artist Eduardo Paolozzi . All were original members of the Independent Group, which dedicated itself to introducing ideas of mass culture (through, for example, \"as found\" objects) to modernism. Hamilton admitted discovering On Growth and Form through Henderson . Significantly, Hamilton recall ed: \"Sigfried Giedion's Mechanization Takes Command became a primary source book immediately after its publication in 1948. It was particularly significant for me in that it complemented On Growth and Form , which deals with the natural world in just the wide -ranging manner of Giedion's perception of technological form and process.\" See: Richard Hamilton, Collected Words 1953 -1982 (London: Thames and Hudson, 1982), 10-12. At the opening of Growth and Form , which coincided with the convening of the eighth CIAM congress just north of London in the suburban village of Hoddesdon on July 7 -14, 1951, Le Corbusier declared: \"The authors of this 353 noted, \"was that the eye might enjoy itself without having to call in the intellect to help it make qualitative judgements\".49 Coincidently in the very same year as Growth and Form , the artist Gyorgy Kepes, whose discourse on \"pattern seeing\" was influencing architects in the 1960s, had organised The New Landscape , an exhibition of scientific photography held at MIT, where he was based. Kepes's display was not unlike that by Hamilton, with magn ified images of natural phenomena mounted on grid made of extremely fine struts so as to appear hovering thus removed from any context. The effect was to immerse the visitor within this \"landscape\", thereby amplifying the visual experience of objects that were to serve as gestalt entities for designers. While Hamilton's Growth and Form bore the telling subtitle \"The Development of Natural Shapes and Structures\", it was through the book Aspects of Form: a Symposium on Form and Nature , which appeared immediately after the exhibition, that the \"qualitative\" lessons of Thompson began penetrating art and architecture. Edited by Lancelot Law Whyte, a Scottish financier, engineer, and commentator on science, Aspects of Form resulted from a colloquium held in September 1951, two months after Growth and Form closed. It brought together mainly scientists (including biologists, crystallographers, and geneticists) but also the Gestalt psychologist Rudolf Arnheim and the art historian E.H. Gombrich to explore the \"diff erent aspects of spatial form , including both external form or visible shape, exhibition are people who have observed, who are sensitive and who are poets.... The exhibition has moved me very deeply, for I found in it a unity of thought which gave me great pleasure.\" See: Le Corbusier, Speech given at the opening of Growth and Form (July 3, 1951), in David Robbins, ed., The Independent Group: Postwar Britain and the Aesthetics of Plenty (Cambridge MA: The MIT Press, 1990) , 17. 49 \"Exhibitions\", The Architectural Review (October 1951): 273. 354 and internal form or structure, as well as transformation \".50 \"Our theme\", Whyte emphasised, \"is thus the realisation of unity of spatial form in the complex processes of physics , biology, psychology, and art .\"51 Tyng acquired a copy of Aspects of Form as soon as it was available in the United States in the early 1950s.52 Given Safdie's introduction to Thompson's ideas by Tyng, he likely discovered Whyte through her as well. Safd ie admired 50 Arnheim became one of Kepes's many interlocutors on The New Landscape. For the influence of Gestalt psychology on Kepes, s ee: Reinhold Martin, The Organizational Complex: Architecture, Media, and Corporate Space (Cam bridge MA: The MIT Press, 2003), 51-52. Kepes's search for an aesthetic correspondence between art and science appeared in his artistic work. As Phillip Ritterbush observes, \"Gyorgy Kepes is well known for his attempts to reproduce organic form by manipulating the emulsion of photographic plates\" - efforts early published in Arts & Architecture (August 1946, July 1948, and August 1948). See: Ritterbush, The Art of Organic Forms (Washington D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1968), 74-75. Kepes's \"pattern -seeing\" found parallels in remarks made by Herbert Read, the director of the Institute of Contemporary Arts, where Growth and Fo rm was installed. Read noted \"the revelation that perception itself is essentially a pattern - selecting and pattern -making function (a Gestalt formation)\", thus bringing \"works of art and natural phenomena on to an identical plane of inquiry.\" See: Read, \"Preface\", Lancelet Law Whyte, ed., Aspects of Form: A Symposium on Form in Nature and Art (New York: Pellegrini & Cudahy, 1951) , n.p. Read's emphasis on perception was symptomatic of postwar culture: as Adrian Forty notes, in the \"post- 1945 era, interest in 'order' has shifted to the psychology of perception, to the study the study of human perception as the key to order in the worl d of artefacts\" - for example, the basis of Kepes's MIT colleague Kevin Lynch's \" analysis of the order of cities \", which stro ngly marked thinking on the Expo 67 master plan , \"was not the cities themselves, but the perceptual apparatus through which people knew them.\" See: Forty, Words and Buildings: A Vocabulary of Modern Architecture (London : Thames & Hudson, 2000), 241. 51 Whyte, \"Introduction\", Aspects of Form: A Symposium on Form in Nature and Art , 2. Among the contributors to Aspects of Form were the scientists Conrad Waddington and Joseph Needham, both of whom were Whyte's colleagues in the Theoretical Biology Club formed at Cambridge University in the 1930s. As Reinhold Martin observes, Kepes had met Waddington and Needham in London in the 1930s and was deeply influenced by their theories. Moreover, both Sigfried Giedion and Walter Gropius would, when corresponding with Kepes about his project, refer to Whyte's Aspects of Form as an important source. Kepes eventually included statements by Giedion and Gropius in his book The New Landscape in Art and Science (1956). See: Martin, The Organizational Complex: Architecture, Media, and Corporate Space , 70-71. Waddington later became a kind of futurologist. In his last book The Man -Made Future (London: Palgrave Macmillan, 1978), he prognosticated on \"Population\", \"Food\", the \"Controlling Nature of Man\", along with other themes including a chapter on \"Urbanisation\" that concluded in a brief overview of \"Specialised Cities\" and listed Habitat 67 under the heading \"Super Beehive Cities\" (the other example was Paolo Soleri's Arcosanti in Arizona). The other \"specialised Tokyo Bay project of 1960). Waddington accompanied the description of Habitat 67 with his own photograph. 52 Sarah Goldhagen, Lou is Kahn's Situated Modernism (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2001): 234n27. 355 the diverse collection of contributors to Aspects of Form . Marked by Whyte's approach, Safdie would, well after the completion of Habitat, continue to call for the recognition of \"a certain unity in nature and in human energy\": in the coming \"e ra of greater integration of human thought\", the \"concept of the artist - the man who... makes objects of art for others - must become much less important in our life. Our furniture, our cars, made so that they are more meaningful in our lives, will become our art.\" 53 To this unification of art and life, via machined consumer objects, Safdie may well have added \"building\", which was, by the time of the Roorkee paper, his preferred euphemism for \"architecture\". 54 Later, like many others in the 1960s, he would replace both terms by environment . Safdie was deeply indebted to Thompson when using bio -organic imagery as a conceptual apparatus for architectural form. He tied examples culled from the natural world (in the vein of Thompson) to a larger social need f or \"Economy\", the achievement of which, in buildings, was \"a moral obligation of our time\": Economy is achieved by using the most readily available material to enclose the most space, and using the least labour, i.e. process. The exploration of the effici ent form means the exploration of those geometries which most readily achieve structural stability with the least material, and those systems of \"space packing\", or the subdivision of space which most efficiently serves the requirements we are providing. 53 Safdie, Beyond Habitat , 171-172. When describing Whyte's thought, Safdie wrote: \"For the first time since the Renaissance, and probably under the influence of Eastern thinking, we are coming to believe that there isn't a dual world of so -called science and so -called art and humanities.... In his Aspects of Form , twelve different people, an astronomer, a chemist, and a physicist among them, talk about form in their own disciplines, and discover there is a unity to it all.\" 54 Schools of architecture, Safdie argued, \"do not communicate to the student that he is first and foremost a builder and that in the realization of building he is dependent on a team\"; consequen tly, \"we must reorganize the See: Safdie, \"Why not Utopia?\", 11. Safdie's description was symptomatic of the 1960s, when architecture schools were often rechristened - for example the College of Environmental D esign at Berkeley, renamed in 1959. 356 The wing of a vulture is made up of a three -dimensional network of thin bone giving maximum strength with minimum material; the beehive cell gives the maximum storage space for the minimum wax. In the construction of the environment, we must explore the g eometries, the systems of construction which achieve the most with the least. 55 Safdie borrowed openly from Thompson, who had illustrated On Growth and Form with images of a honeycomb and the metacarpal bone of a vulture's wing. Thompson thought the vulture's wing bone akin to a Warren truss (in which parallel horizontal chords were connected only by diagonal bracing members). 56 While obviously sympathetic to this suggestion of \"systems of construction\", Safdie was not only interested in the qualities of lightweight construction per se but sought a way to produce buildings exhibiting the very \"economy\" of space and material suggested by Thompson's examples. Safdie's invocation of \"systems of 'space packing'\" thus drew on a further source in On Growth and F orm: an 55 Safdie, \"Why not Utopia?\", 9. While providing a largely technical reading of \"economy\" at Roorkee, Safdie began, likely with the authority granted by completing Habitat, to describe the concept in slightly more human istic terms: \"The architect cannot live out of the political reality of his time. For the first time in history, we accept that everyone has the right to economic and social privileges - not only in our own community, but universally. To the architect, t his means that Economy is a moral obligation!\" See: Safdie, \"Habit at 67\" (September -December 1967), 6. 56 Thompson found the vulture's metacarpal bone superior to the Warren truss: \"In all the mechanical side of anatomy nothing can be more beautiful than the construction of a vulture's metacarpal bone.... The engineer sees in it a perfect Warren truss, just such a one as is often used for a main rib in an aeroplane. Not only so, but the bone is better than the truss; for the engineer has to be content to set his V- shaped struts all in one place, while in the bone they are put, with obvious inimitable advantage, in a three -dimensional configuration.\" See: Thompson, On Growth and Form (New York: The Macmillan Company, 1942) , 981. In his contribution to Aspects of Form , the biologist Conrad Waddington, Whyte's colleague in the Theoretical Biology Club at Cambridge University during the 1930s, juxtaposed Thompson's photograph of the vulture wing with a drawing of the radiolarian Aulonia Hexagona (which had be en beautifully drawn by the German biologist and philosopher Ernst Haeckel, whose book Kunstformen der Natur appeared between 1899 and 1904 and, with its visual emphasis on symmetry and organisation in natural forms, became a source for space frames enthus iasts) . Louis Kahn kept a slide of Waddington's paired images in his personal collection. The impact of Thompson's imagery on postwar discourses on lightweight construction, particularly space frames, was evinced in Anne Tyng's work. For a discussion of these exchanges, as well as a reproduction of Kahn's slide, see: Goldhagen, Louis Kahn's illustration of a \"14 -hedra\" that, Thompson argued, demonstrably revealed the idea of \"close -packing\": \"by means of an assemblage of these fourteen -sided figures... space is filled and homogenously partitioned - into equal, similar and similarly situated cells - with an economy of surface in relation to volume\".57 Safdie responded to Thompson in presenting Urban System 1965, a hypothetical housing project made of interlocking hexagonal units (fig. 6.11). Close-packing is, typically, the elimination o f air between adjacent solid bodies; the Urban System exhibited this in its polyhedral forms. The extended corollary of \"economy\" here meant a consistent reduction of means - the \"geometry has been modified to achieve a more efficient transmission of stre sses\"; the \"proportions have been modified to achieve a more efficient organization of dwelling with very limited circulation space\"; the \"exterior surface has been reduced\" - to arrive at \"a more complex module of a basic shell\". 58 Safdie tied this, in turn, to what he called \"The Structure of Numbers\": \"In nature a single element combined within an order results in a variety of hundreds of permutations and combinations\" - a view illustrated by the unit combinations of A Case for City Living that indicated, once again, \"variety within a single building system\". 59 In architectural terms, this 57 Thompson, On Growth and Form , 551. Thompson's description was also taken up by Anne Tyng, who wrote in 1965: \"From a comprehension of the geometries of close -packing may be developed forms which are most effective in creating spaciousness where populations are dense\" (a synthetic description of Safdie's future interests by the mid -1960s). See: Anne Tyng, quoted in David B. Brownlee and Da vid G. DeLong, Louis I. Kahn: In the Realm of Architecture (New York: Rizzoli, 1991), 61. As Brownlee and DeLong note, Tyng made her remarks while applying for a grant to complete a book tentatively titled Anatomy of Form . 58 Safdie, \"Why not Utopia?\", 15. 59 Ibid., 10. The discourse on \"the structure of numbers\" echoed Aldo van Eyck's own concept of \"aesthetics of numbers\". Safdie both followed and departed from van Eyck. On the one hand, the \"structure of numbers\" expressed, as Safdie explained in ter ms of the Habitat unit combinations, the rule of \"nature\" where \"a single element combined within an order results in a variety of hundreds of permutations and combinations\". On the 358 meant maintaining an evident reciprocity between part and whole in the overall composition. The conceptual conjunction of part and whole underpinned Safdie's entire ap proach to Habitat 67. While Whyte had called for \"unity\" in \"spatial form\", as discovered across artistic and scientific disciplines, he had also explained that \"recent Western culture, say 1910 to date\" - in other words, modernism - was irrefutably marke d by a \"concern with elementals \" - that is, \"basic particles, the protein or organisms\", and even \"geometrical elements in art and architecture\"; this breaking down of wholes (via visualised correspondences between art and biology in efforts such as The New Landscape and Growth and Form ) was now to be accompanied by \"a universal process of ordering \" resulting from an inevitable but healthy \" clash between contrasted forms\". 60 As much as this suggested a sense of aesthetics, the very idea of \"contrast\" implie d the evolutionary rhetoric of improvement . other hand, the \"structure of numbers\" is \"not limited to the combination of a single repetitive element\" - in other words, not in terms of van Eyck's Amsterdam Orphanage - but \"to the combination of several different elements of different size which are related to each other through geometric order.\" 60 Lancelot Law Whyte, \" From Primitive Disorder to Twentieth -Century Visual Images\", in Reyner Banham, ed., The Aspen Papers: Twenty Years of Design Theory from the International Design Conference in Aspen (London: Pall Mall Press, 1974) , 60-61. Whyte delivered his talk at the 1959 Aspen Design Conference, which took the theme \"Communication: The Image Speaks\". At the 1967 Aspen Design Conference, Safdie address ed the concept of \"order\" in a joint presentation with the architectural theorist Christopher Alexander. Prefatorily invoking Whyte's \"unitary thinking\", Safdie set out to \"Irritated by the conference's theme, 'Order and Disorder,' which was inspired by Ben Shahn's call for the value of disorder, we decided to analyze some basic psychic st ructures, those usually associated with disorder - identity, the need for variety, and how an individual can affect his own dwelling, the need for change.\" Safdie presented a\"6 -module component system\" made of seemingly platonic solids: a cube and \"five a ccessories\" to be \"selected by the tenants\"; the cube would represent \"stability\" (\"to satisfy requirements of sunlight, distribution of services\", and so on) while \"the five components can be placed to produce hundreds of different houses that have truly different spatial character and are capable of adaptation and change by individuals\". See: Moshe Safdie and Christopher Alexander, \"Complete or Incomplete?\", in Banham, ed., The Aspen Papers: Twenty Years of Design Theory from the International Design Con ference in Aspen , 191 -196; Safdie, Beyond , 150-151. 359 As such, the bio -mechanical model could suggest an idea on process , bringing it closer to a view on industrialised building. The translation of naturalistic processes was, therefore, to offer a total theory of design and construction. The question remained whether Habitat 67 stood as a polemic on the technics of the dwelling unit itself or on the overall functionality of the housing complex as a work of urbanism. Safdie preferred not to consider these \"design c oncepts... in terms of dualities\"; instead, the architect should \"think of the design of an object or organism\" - in other words, the \"modular unit\" devised for the various Habitat schemes - \"simultaneously in terms of repetition and variation, system and variety, standardisation and rhythm, conformity and identity\". The approach, he admitted, followed the \"unitary thinking\" of Lancelot Law Whyte. 61 As opposed to the quest for ideality - namely, perfected outward appearance - \"if science\", and by extension a rchitecture , \"is to advance\", Whyte believed, \"it must discover how the ordering of parts gives form to the whole, in organisms for example.\"62 At Roorkee, Safdie put it in architectural terms: \" The definition of structure is the arrangement of all parts of the whole. It is this definition that we must satisfy in our building form\".63 The condition was, he believed, imminent as Habitat 67 broke ground. Thus when speaking to the journal 61 Safdie, \"On from Habitat\", 45. Safdie's appreciation of Whyte's \"unitary thinking\" lay in his reading of Aspects of Form . In the introduction to Aspects of Form , Whyte declared that the opposition be tween \"atoms\" and \"forms\" had produced two sets of ideas - \"atomism- material analysis -quantitative precision\" versus \"form - unity -symmetry\" led in part to \"the old mechanism- vitalism quarrel\") - that may, antago nistic\". See: Whyte, \"Introduction\", Aspects of Form: A Symposium on Form in Nature and Art , 2, 3. 62 Whyte, \"Introduction\", Aspects of Form: A Symposium on Form in Nature and Art , 3. 63 Safdie, \"Why not Utopia?\", 9, emphasis added. 360 Progressive Pier, Safdie insisted that his project was not \"an offshoot of functionalism\": \"Function is not an adequate word to describe this sense of structure. I believe morphology - the science of evolution of form in nature - is more descriptive.\"64 Illustrating an article titled \"Building a City with King Kong Blocks\", photographs emphasised almost exclusively the plant fabrication of precast dwelling units and their mechanised placement in the overall complex (fig. 6.12). It was, the CCWE claimed, the use of \"mass production methods\" to create housing on an \"assembly line\". 65 Yet as an architectural analogy, morphology, the branch of biology that deals with the relationships between the form and structure of living things, implied a theory of building that departed from the limitations of serialised production. D'Arcy Thompson and others had purposely distinguished morphology from anatomy in trying to elucidate the processes governing form rather than determining the functions of the various components of organisms.66 Duly inspired, Safdie told Progressive Architecture that if the architect starts \"imitating the morphological process that evolves in nature\", then he will \"automatically stop looking at buildings as single entities\"; instead, he \"would have to think 64 \"Building a City wi th King Kong Blocks\", Progressive Architecture (October 1966): 226, 231. The assessment of Habitat 67 was part of a special issue on the question \"Concrete: Where Do We Go from Here?\" that included \"Komendant on Concrete\"; while the engineer discussed Habitat, the article only included images of his collaborations with Louis Kahn. 65 Canadian Corporation for the 1967 World Exhibition, Habitat 67 (Ottawa: the Queen's Printer, 1967): n.p. 66 Ritterbush, The Art of Organic Forms, 7. 361 of cities as systems, as building systems.\"67 Given the article layout, readers may well have accepted the common understanding of \"building system s\" as sets of dimensionally related components, largely factory made, and fitting together in various ways on site. Indeed, Safdie's work from A Case for City Living to Habitat 67 had rested on a similar view of production. Yet \"system\" offered something greater. Allied to the prognostic value of \"morphology\", the turn to \"system\" allowed Safdie to imagine bringing into contact two vastly different scales of design: the prefabrication of building components and the design of cities. EXHIBITING CONSTRUCT ION As a theme pavilion, Habitat 67 was meant to help visitors understand and believe in the future. Unlike other pavilions, Habitat presented no hands -on displays, whether diminutive or magnified, by which \"man\" could experience new forms of culture and science. Instead, Habitat offered a novel architectural technics - this would be the tangible mode of its popularisation. The self -enclosed, prefabricated dwelling unit was to be appreciated in the public mind as encapsulating imminent norms of domestic life, while the overall complex signalled, given the promise of its post-Expo expansion, the pending form of the modern city. As the very first schematic report on Habitat 67 declared in early 1964: while \"World's Exhibitions are events in which we pause and take stock\", their \"justification\" lies \"in accelerating both physical and intellectual aspirations of our time\"; thus, \"The enormous 67 \"Building a City with K ing Kong Blocks\", 231. 362 investment of a World Exhibition can be justified if it has reduced the time lapse between the time of conceiving an idea and its realization.\"68 Taking stock of present realities was, in fact, predicated on \"accelerating\", thus approximating, a curative future. In architectural terms, this meant a form based on using - and in terms of a spectacle, testing - current technologies for solving future social needs. If the Canadian population was assumed to more than double, reaching 40,000,000 by the end of the century (so the Habitat 67 report predicted), then it \"means the equivalent construction of a complete new city of 70,000 inhabitants each and every month to the year 2,000.\" 69 Thus the housing exhibition as the answer to a looming millennial crisis: \"In building and exhibiting this unique project,\" the Expo Press Service pronounced, \"Expo 67 is attempting to solve some of the most pressing problems of construction and urban growth which today face Canada and other nations.\" 70 Armed with demographic evidence, Expo 67 promoted its own version of a \"home of tomorrow\" - a concept crucial to the propagation of modern housin g before an expectant public, whether Buckminster Fuller's \"Dymaxion House\" (a name dreamt up by an advertising man at Marshall Field's department store in Chicago, where the house debuted in 1929) or George Keck's \"House of Tomorrow\" and \"Crystal House\" ( respectively displayed at the 1933 and 1934 Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago) or Alison and Peter Smithson's \"House of the Future\" (promoted by the Daily Mail newspaper for its 1956 Ideal 68 Safdie, Andrews, et al., Combined Report Covering the Schematic Design, Development and Economical Aspects of the Proposed Permanent Housing Exhibit Habitat 67 , n.p. 69 Ibid., n.p . 70 Expo Press 67 to Build Habitat\" (April 8, 1965): n.p. 363 Home Exhibition in London), to list only those with appropr iately suggestive names and launched in conveniently consumerist settings.71 Yet unlike these singular efforts, which in at least the first two instances presented detailed advances in prefabrication but otherwise responded to typical conventions of land ownership, Habitat 67 was to embody \"both physical and intellectual aspirations\" of its era not only by championing an ideal home (in terms of fashioning public taste) but by presenting how it was actually made - or, really, how it could be made again and a gain. The first housing unit was cast on February 18, 1966. It was hoisted into place on April 7, 1966; the last unit was lifted on February 28, 1967. The entire structure of \"Habitat 67 - Phase 1\" was erected in ten months, twenty -one days. While Habita t 67 appeared, at first glance, to arise on a conventional building site, its actual chantier was, in fact, nearby - in a custom-built factory for fabricating all concrete components of the housing complex. As 1,121 foundation piles began to be driven, a 55,000 square-foot precasting plant was built by the concrete subcontractors, Francon Ltd of Montreal, on the promontory of Mackay Pier and just adjacent to Safdie's project. Within the plant (itself made of precast concrete T -sections) were four steel moulds with hinged walls, each capable of producing one housing unit every 48 hours. Preassembled rebar cages as well as adjustable steel panels were lowered inside each mould, allowing variable wall 71 To help popularise a technological future, George Keck's Crystal House was exhibited with Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion Car parked in front - both could be seen for the combined admission of ten cents. Indeed, it was at the Century of Progress Exposition (which presented a section called \"Home and Industrial Arts\") that the term prefabrication came to substitute mass production in general discussions of housing. S ee: Brian Horrigan, \"The Home of Tomorrow, 1927 -1945\", in Joseph J. Corn, ed., Imaging Tomorrow: History, Technology, and the American Future (Cambridge MA: The MIT Press, 1986) , 145. 364 thicknesses of five or twelve inches. Concrete was delivered by ready -mix trucks and pumped into the forms. The housing units were cast in two stages: first, the floor and perimeter beams; second, the walls poured in three lifts, with block -out panels at window and door locations. The mould was covered and st eam cured. A 100-ton rubber-tired straddle gantry then raised each box out of its formwork and transported it to the stockyard where it was sandblasted, after which crews post-tensioned and grouted the steel rods within the beams and walls (fig. 6.13). M oved to a finishing area, the unit received all components, fixtures, and finishes, including preassembled kitchens and a pre -moulded reinforced fibreglass bathroom - a highly publicised feature designed by Safdie in co -ordination with Fiberglas Canada Ltd , and habitually described by him as exemplifying \"one of the technically new parts of the Habitat interior\": its \"virtue [is] that it is a continuous surface. Instead of having hundreds of pieces to put together, with a multitude of joints, all you have to do is make the connections\" (fig. 6.14). 72 Far more important than the smooth finished surface, which imparted a longstanding modernist aesthetic -technical belief in salubrity, was the fact that the bathroom as a whole indicated the sort of modularity Safdie required if his \"system\" was to work as an \"assembly -line\". From here, the Habitat housing unit made the most spectacular part of its journey. The gantry brought the precast box within reach of a stiff -leg mobile derrick crane. This 72 Safdie, Habitat , 22-23. The fibreglass bathrooms had another \"virtue\": as the CCWE noted in a construction progress report, the bid for the bathroom contract by Fiberglas Ltd was above the cash allowance; consequently, the company made up this difference by presenting its \"revolutionary design\" that \"will be marketed... on a commercial basis\", thus keeping with the mandate \"to promote new a pplications of materials and techniques within the main structure\" of Habitat. See: CCWE Architectural Branch, \"Habitat 67 39- 1990- 05-027, Fonds Gilles Gagnon, Canadian Centre for Architecture. 365 behemoth, const ructed by Dominion Bridge Company of Montreal, the storied builders of Canadian infrastructure since the nineteenth century, stood on 80 -foot high stilts set 70 -feet by 70-feet apart, its boom reaching 200 feet (fig. 6.15). The crane hoisted the unit out of the plant yard, rolled over the site on a rail track (mounted on the foundation beams or slab footings of Habitat itself, thus to resist the massive erection loads), and lowered each box into its designated place. In extraordinary photographs issued by the CCWE and circulating worldwide in architecture and building industry journals alike, closely cropped perspectives of the dwelling unit and the derrick crane advanced the argument that these elements were effectively symbiotic. The trussed jib and boo m of the crane, almost dematerialised when seen against the sky, imparted a sense of weightlessness to the box itself. The housing unit appeared spectacularly hanging in midair, hovering above the St Lawrence River and the staggered silhouette of Habitat, and seemingly weightless - quite literally, a floating signifier of \"cellular construction\". The symbolic conjunction of unit and crane rested, however, upon a deliberate omission. The only way the derrick crane could actually set many of the concrete boxes in place was, in fact, with the aid of a 130-ton crawler crane. 73 Yet in its most significant and detailed promotional publication for Habitat 67, in which the phases of Safdie's designs were recounted alongside coverage of the casting and erecting procedures as well as an extensive portfolio of how the \"houses\" were to be finished according to taste, the CCWE neither mentioned the second crane nor showed it in photographs documenting the construction. 73 The derrick crane had a ca pacity to lift 70 tons to 120 feet; some concrete units weighed up to 90 tons. 366 Architecture and trade journals followed in their oversight.74 Construction appeared to be effortless. This purposeful exclusion was really the working of a powerful modernist imaginary: that is, to render architectural construction as fully automated. Contemporaneous tendencies were envisioning entirely machined cities, most famously the Archigram group's Plug-in City proposal of 1964, in which cranes continuously moved capsule dwellings among massive inverted ziggurat complexes, cylindrical towers, and diagonal lattice structures, thereby shaping what its designer Peter Cook called \"a replacement city\". 75 Habitat 67 was not as bold a statement (nor did its architect share Archigram's science - fiction enthusiasms); but the acute views of derrick crane and dwelling unit expressed an 74 For example, Interbuild, a magazine issued by Prefabrication Publications in London, mentioned only the derrick crane - this in spite of a detailed discussion of Safdie's project in a section devoted to \"system building\". See: \"Montreal's pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance\", Interbuild (February 1967). Only a few observers resisted being similarly seduced. Among them was Alexander Pike, an indefatigable chronicler of building systems in A rchitectural Design throughout the 1960s, who included a photograph showing the derrick crane lifting a dwelling unit with the assistance of the crawler crane: \"Despite the publicity given to the design of special lifting equipment considered as an essenti al feature of the scheme, no impression of consistency of purpose is given by this illustration of the main crane receiving a rather makeshift assistance from an auxiliary in the hoisting of a box unit\". See: Pike, \"Habitat '67\", Architectural Design (Mar ch 1967): 119. Pike credited the photograph to Concrete Quarterly , which had published it in its July -September 1966 issue and included a caption that noted the special function of the derrick crane but completely ignored the obvious presence of the roller crane. David Jacobs, a New York Times critic report ing on Habitat while living there with his family, also perspicaciously noted: \"...very soon after our arrival my wife and I decided that corners had been cut during the construction of the interior in or der to keep the ever -rising costs down; that second crane had to be compensated for somehow.\" Jacobs's view of Habitat was otherwise favourable. See: David Jacobs, \"What It's Like to Live in an Experiment\", The New York Times (June 4, 1967). 75 Peter Coo k, Experimental Architecture (New York: Universe Books, 1970) , 129. In 1968, Archigram member Ron Herron produce d his \"Oasis\" collage, in which Habitat was placed alongside fragments of works by Denys Lasdun, Mies van der Rohe, Kenzo Tange - these presumably already outmoded forms were juxtaposed against an open lattice frame with \"plug -in\" modules, the resulting impression being that future architecture would be one of open frames and interchangeable units. Habitat 67 was not, of course, a \"plug -in\" solution. Safdie's choice of concrete was based on creating a composite \"three- dimensional\" form to avoid what he believed was structural redundancy of plug -in projects. Safdie's apparent neglect of steel structures open ed his project to criticism. 367 especially heroic vision of construction, one emphasising Safdie's claim that \"no work is done in the air beyond simple connections\" (fig. 6.16).76 The notion was echoed by the CCWE when presenting a close-up image of the unit being lowered into place while dangling from cable stays: \"A five -man rigging crew can lift a box into place and secure it in one and a half hours\".77 While the \"factory\" replaced the need of formwork, the \"in the air\" production supplanted the demand for falsework (scaffolding) typical of construction. I n both cases, notions on \"building a building\" characteristic of poured concrete construction was believed to be replaced by the seemingly seamless casting, erecting, and joining of parts along an apparently frictionless path from shop floor to crane to site. The rhetoric of minimal assembly was a neat summation of typical theories of industrialised building. This had as its essential features the mechanisation of labour (Safdie's insistence that all \"work could be done on the ground\", thereby eliminating the customary practice of workers arriving on site to ply their respective trades), a smooth continuity and evenness of output (the creation of dwelling units in \"assembly -line\" fashion), and mass production (the infinite capacity of the on -site factory). 78 As Safdie argued just prior to the opening of Habitat 67 - thus at a moment of justifying a construction process that remained, for now, extremely expensive (in other words, without having reached an economy of scale): 76 The \"s imple connections\" were the bolting, spot welding, or post necessary to achieving the overall \"three -dimensional structure\". Safdie, Habitat , 46. 77 Canadian Corporation for the World Exhibition, Habitat 67 , n.p. 78 Safdie, Habitat , 46, 50. 368 Just compare the typical construction site to a typical factory of a manufactured product.... Never does one see idleness in a factory of this kind. Never does one see work being torn out because it has not provided for other components, or because it has not fitted the given tolerances. I n contrast, the typical construction site is swarmed with idle men: riggers waiting for a piece to be installed; workers carrying equipment and materials for installation through the multi-storey structure; workers ripping out work to provide for other tra des; plumbers interfering with carpenters or concrete men; components being modified because they do not fit within the structure; and hand labours being used for a multitude of construction operations, from building form work for concrete, to the fitting and bending of ducts and pipes. All this indicated waste and inefficiency. 79 Safdie's desire to advance techniques of industrialised building was tied to a fairly typical theory of work - that mechanisation would forever eliminate \"waste\" and idle labour. Prefabrication was - philosophically, materially, technically - essential to this vision.80 Yet it was Safdie's conception of a cellular system (as opposed to other types such as panel or skeletal frame techniques) that gave the impression of a \"whole\" presumably resulting from the complete rationalisation of a research programme, component manufacture, assembly, and marketing integrated into a single process. 81 Thus the suggestive imagery of the crane and concrete unit: with everything produced \"on the ground\", it became only a matter of joining the boxes in space. Indeed, the contractors Francon Ltd had employed a detailed 79 Moshe Safdie, \"Habitat 67 - Towards the Development of a Building System\", Journal of the Prestressed Concrete Institute Journal (February 1967): 62. 80 Despite being a \"wet\" material, concrete took on properties of \"dry\" construc tion through prefabricatio n: to be presumably lightweight, thus suited to installation by limited labour power. 81 By the 1960s, architects had come to define \"industrialised building\" by an expanded scope of tasks, especially in distinction to what many perceived as the limitations of \"prefabrication\". Safdie similarly noted: \"Industrialized building does not necessarily mean pre -fabrication. It is the organizational re -structuring of an industry in which raw material manufacturing, component manufacturing, design, research, deve lopment, assembly, and marketing are integrated into a single process within a co -ordinated organization .\" See: Safdie, \"Industrialized Buildings\", Architecture Canada (November 1968): 36. 369 plastic model of the crane and the housing complex to \"help crews visualise assembly order for 2,798 pieces\" - an approach recalling Safdie's eschewal of conventional drawn elevations in favour of schedules showing axonometric diagrams of various sequences for stacking units (fig. 6.17).82 (In the resulting obviation of the supremacy of the fa\u00e7ade, the aesthetic \"modernity\" of Habitat 67 lay in the reversibility of front and back.83) The dimensionally accurate fabricated dwelling unit and the precisely calibrated movements of the crane were thus together imagined producing the effects of \"economy\" desired by Safdie's pursuit of \"space p acking\" as a method of architectural design. If, as the CCWE repeatedly insisted, Habitat 67 was only in its infancy, then displaying the actual means and methods of its future completion were surely as important as the partially realised work itself. Building industry journals believed that the \"$2 -million, custom -built production plant at the end of Mackay Pier represents the most outstanding construction development to be seen on site at present\". 84 Despite its \"growing pains\", the 82 Walter Rooke, \"Habitat Pioneers in Design and Methods to Produc e Assembly -line Housing\", Heavy Construction News (April 22, 1966): 14. The final structural drawings included an Erection Schedule, which actually showed the derrick crane and where the units would be placed as it moved along its guide rails. For Safdie , the mechanisation of the building industry promised a change in architect's use of drawings: \"During the construction of Habitat, for example, we had several hundred working drawings and several thousand shop drawings - a drawing for every piece. Ideall y, mechanisation would mean that you would make a few drawings of basic components. A series of cards would specify which of these components should some together, and in what manner. In such a system, you would be working from a few cards instead of hun dreds of thousands of drawings.\" See: Safdie, Habitat (1967), 50- 51. The idea was predicated on the use of computer punch -cards ; in theory, the contraction of on -site construction labour was tied to the future rise of computer ised scheduling , which Safdi e had witnessed in the highly publicised \"critical path method\" used by the CCWE Construction Branch to co -ordinate the building of Expo 67. 83 Yve-Alain Bois, \"Metamorphosis Axonometry\", Daidalos 1 (1981): 57. 84 Walter Rooke, \"Habitat Pioneers in De sign and Methods to Produce Assembly -line Housing\", in Heavy Construction News (April 22, 1966): 10. Not all views were as celebratory. When discussing the \"exotic structures\" at Expo 67, the British weekly Engineering reservedly noted: \"Certainly the mo st talked -about Expo 370 Francon Plant \"is still the most exciting development in building going on today\", stated another.85 \"Habitat Pioneers in Design and Methods to Produce Assembly -line Housing\", promised Heavy Construction News ; \"Habitat 67's Housing Blocks Build a Better Environment\", decided Engineering News -Record ; \"Building a City with King Kong Blocks\", observed Progressive Architecture. The declarations united the specialised tasks of fabricating a \"block\" and the gigantic ambitions of building of a \"city\" along a single line of action. The laudatory projections - all written in 1966, well before the completion of Habitat - coincided with the ambitions of the CCWE. In late 1965, the CCWE Advisory Committee on Architecture \"unanimously resolved\" to ensure that \"if possible, the tooling costs of this project be not lost and therefore, that the project is regarded by the Corporation and presented to the public as pilot project\" - again, as prototype - and \"the first step of a continuing housing development on Mackay Pier\". 86 At the very same moment, Safdie similarly declared when presenting his project in the pages of the CMHC journal Habitat: It was decided that in spite of the fact that amortizing all the equipment over 160 dwellings would result in extremely high unit costs, the construction system would structure is the conglomeration of precast concrete 'boxes' rejoicing in the name Habitat 67. Many regard this daring concept as the prototype of a new way of solving the housing problem suffered by many nations. Engineering is less optimistic, but regards Habitat as probably the most ambitious single project at Expo. The revolutionary ideas incorporated are bound to yield useful information, especially with regard to concrete precasting techniques and planning.\" See: \"Expo 67: the Exotic Structures\", in Engineering (London, 13 January 1967): 63. 85 \"Habitat 67, the Ultimate in Precast Concrete Construction\", 37. 86 \"Extract of a Resolution and Recommendation Adopted at the 7th and 8th Meeting of the Advisory Committee on Architectur e Held on November 19, 20, 1965 and March 22, 23, 1966, Respectively\" (November 19 -20, 1965): 2, Box PK -290, Fonds John Parkin, Canadian Centre for Architecture. The ambition to complete Habitat 67 was set early: \"Ultimately, Habitat 67 may extend along C it\u00e9 du Havre\" - as Mackay Pier was also known - \"to house five thousand people providing shops, schools, and integrating the many cultural facilities provided by Expo\"; s ee: Peters, \"Economic Aspects\", 1 . 371 be demonstrated with the hope that such equipment could be used after the exhibition.... The decision arrived at was that within the context of a World Exhibition and within the context of an experimental housing project, it was more important to suggest the methods and techniques and potential of mass production rather than to achieve low unit costs.... 87 Already anticipating accusations of exorbitant costs despite the project's ultimately reduced size (\"the Committee is aware of public criticism of aspects of the project, particularly with regard to high capital costs\"), the goal was now to insist that if the project was to stand as a polemic for the rationalisation of building, then it be popularised by its means of production. 88 The advising architects thus motioned: THAT the concrete plant and crane be left intact but not necessarily kept in operation during Expo and that it be treated as an exhibit, provided this is consistent with their future usefulness to complete the project and that it will result in an ultimate saving in cost. THAT adequate funds be provided for, and work started immediately by the consulting architect on an exhibition which will illustrate the final development and document the complete rational behind the project which will justify the original capital cost, on the one hand, and make a case for Habitat as one solution to the urban environment, on the other. 87 Safdie, \"Habitat 67\" ( September -December 1965), 4. Safdie added: \"it was consequently decided to treat all these components as highly sophisticated industrialized products, even when unit costs could only eventually be reduced by increasing quantities to 1,000, 5,000 or even 10,000 units.\" 88 The CCWE was sensitive to cost implications: \"Since Habitat is a prototype, it is expected that the cost of producing individual units will be higher in Phase I than later, when fabrication and construction techniques are developed further\". See: Expo 67 Informati on Services, \"Drawing Board Dream Will Be Built\" (April 12, 1965), Safdie Archive Box PF20, Folder 58/100/PF12/1. The exorbitant cost of Habitat was fodder for magazines such as Canadian Builder , which by the mid -1960s was deeply vested in covering all aspects of industrialised building. In a special issue on \"1967- 2067, the Next 100 Years in Building\", aimed to coincide with the celebrations of the Canadian Centennial and published the same month as the opening of Expo 67, the magazine dismissed Habitat 67 given its high costs, limited scope, and financing (without consideration for future profit) by the government: \"It has been variously reported that the Habitat system has produced apartment units at costs up to $200,000 a unit whereas the average apart ment unit of today costs in the region of $12,000.\" See: \"Habitat 67 - an Expensive Gimmick or a Serious Plan for Mass -produced Housing?\", Canadian Builder (April 1967): 65. 372 THAT as many housing units be put on display in addition to this exhibition to demonstrate the variety and scope of the project and to facilitate the maximum public appreciation of the project.89 Was, then, Habitat 67 to be a measure of its tools and machines or seen as an idealised environment? On the one hand, the Advisory Committee on Architecture was keen to display the construction objects as centrepiece. The existence of the factory reinforced a belief in the plausibility of construction. To exhibit the prefabrication plant was to avow the inevitable completion of Habitat. On the other hand, as Advisory Com mittee members realised, when meeting soon after the precasting plant produced its first unit, the CCWE was more guarded: \"The Corporation has been cautioned against leaving anything on the Site which could be construed as indicating that construction is not complete.\" 90 There was cosmetic worry: in a sense, making public the remarkable apparatus of construction contravened the typically manicured scapes - of pavilions, of politics - of world's fairs. No matter how polemical, the production -cum -exhibition of an unfinished work would possibly disturb perceptions of the fairgrounds as a perfected urban realm. 89 \"Extract of a Resolution and Recommendation Adopted at the 7th and 8th Meeting of the Advisory Committee on Architecture Held on November 19, 20, 1965 and March 22, 23, 1966, Respectively\" (November 19 -20, 1965): 3, Box PK -290, Fonds John Parkin, Canadian Centre for Architecture. The Committee added: \"funds be provided for a complete documentation of the project in all its stages... in the form of a publication for sale\" - resulting in the CCWE publication Habitat 67 (Ottawa: The Queen's Printer, 1967) - and insisted, perhaps wishfully: \"THAT the Corporation take steps to obtain the guarantees to provide for the continuity of management, financing and construction, to complete the project after the close of Expo 67, and to exploit this presently publicly owned unique middle -class housing project as a case study to further a full spectr um of research in the fields of the social sciences, community planning, and urban design.\" 90 \"Extract of a Resolution and Recommendation Adopted at the 7th and 8th Meeting of the Advisory Committee on Architecture Held on November 19, 20, 1965 and March 22, 23, 1966, Respectively\", 4. 373 Safdie responded immediately. He reminded Edward Churchill, a retired colonel and indefatigable Director of the Expo 67 Department of Installations (wh ose reputation rested on having built airfields in North Africa during the Second World War), that \"it has always been stated that the Corporation would encourage that the balance of MacKay Pier be developed in a way compatible with Habitat 67\" and \"it was hoped that the know -how and equipment which have been designed and constructed for the project could be made available to the interested developers who may be able to extend the project on a commercial basis.\" 91 The public monies would bear fruit as the \"pilot project\" was made more real by private means. Safdie concluded: We therefore recommend that the CCWE encourage the keeping of the plant and its equipment intact during the period of the Exhibition. The plant and equipment could be used as an exhib it and/or as storage. It would be essential that the casting beds and moulds remain intact. Furthermore, the CCWE may be able to interest the contractor to participate in such an exhibit within the plant. 92 91 Moshe Safdie, \"Post Expo Considerations for Habitat and MacKay Pier\", letter to Col. E. Churchill (March 31, 1966): 1, Box PF19, Folder 58/191/PF15/20, Moshe Safdie Archive, Canadian Architecture Collection, McGill University. Later, in a confidential memorandum discussing the post -Expo disposal of Habitat and Mackay Pier, Safdie suggested that \"proposals\" by developers \"should be done in the spring of 1967\" thereby allowing \"a successful developer\" to \"negotiate with Habitat contractors for the use of existing equipment should they choose to extend Habitat -type development in their proposal.\" See: Moshe Safdie, \"Considerations in the Disposal of Habitat 67 and Mackay Pier\" (November 22, 1966): 2, Box PF19, Folder 58/191/ PF15/20, Moshe Safdie Archive, Canadian Architecture Collection, McGill University. 92 Safdie, \"Post Expo Considerations for Habitat and MacKay Pier\", letter to Col. E. Churchill, 2. U sing the plant as a storage site kept with the demands of industrialised building. Among the difficulties of industrialisation is the question of \"surplus\". Industrialisation is typically a long -term undertaking: a product is manufactured and stored without knowing when and where it is to be used ; moreover, it can be stockp iled in response to changes in the marketplace. This was entirely impossible in an undertaking such as Habitat: because it was to be built as a demonstration project, its components were not yet commodities per se. By turning the factory into storage, th e idea rested on giv ing the impression of stock piling for use immediately after the world's fair . 374 Once erected, the plant could restart productio n as soon as the fair closed; moreover, it could also stand as another \"prototype\", one marketable to realising other Habitats elsewhere.93 Everything was to remain ready in anticipation of eventual completion. The notion of a proper Habitat 67 Constructi on Exhibit was thus mooted. By the opening day of Expo 67, it was thought essential to the fairgoer's experience. Shown in Safdie's construction drawings as a \"Visitor Circulation Site Plan\", the \"recommended route\" through Habitat started precisely wher e construction yard met housing complex: the CCWE hoped that visitors would approach Habitat having walked along the axis of the \"assembly line\" before arriving at the North Cluster, where the interiors of units were left unfinished owing to the federal government's sudden reluctance for continued financing. Notwithstanding its earlier worries, the CCWE now maintained that this portion was \"purposely left incomplete to demonstrate the design and construction techniques peculiar to Habitat.\" 94 The Deputy Co mmissioner of Expo 67, Robert Shaw, had aimed to keep the precasting plant in place as part of the overall exhibit. The CCWE management insisted that it be removed before the fair's opening. Shaw desperately pressed Safdie and other 93 A comprehensive study of Expo 67 building materials and techniques noted that among the three types of \"innovation\" achieved at Habitat 67 was its \"structu re\", or the components that \"demonstrate the potential of load bearing, three dimensional, precast elements for multi -storey use\"; these elements were \"commercially available\" in \"present or from Francon Ltd\" without \"further research and deve lopment in Canada\". See: I. Kalin, Expo 67: Survey of Building Materials, Systems and Techniques used at the Universal and International Exhibition of 1967 (Ottawa: Materials Branch, Department of Industry, Trade and Commerc e: The Queen's Printer, 1969) . 94 Expo 67 Press Service, \"Expo's Forgotten Exhibit\" (July 13, 1967): 2, Box PF7, Folder 58/100/PF1/1, Moshe Safdie Archive, Canadian Architecture Collection, McGill University. In certain circles, credit for the construction exh ibition was given to the irrepressible Montreal mayor Jean Drapeau, who, when visiting the building site in the company of officials worrying over an incomplete project, claimed being fascinated by the process and suggested that fairgoers would be equally taken by it: \"As the mayor says: 'We decided to announce that Habitat 67 had been left voluntarily unfinished so that the visitors could see how it was built.\" See: Brian McKenna and Susan Purcell, Drapeau (Toronto/Vancouver: Clark, Irwin & Company Limite d, 1980): 155. 375 consultants to fund some sort of construction exhibit. Francon Ltd provided its rolling gantry lift along with three additional concrete boxes revealing \"wall, ceiling and floor construction; the heating and cooling systems, insulation, and portion of the mechanical core, str ipped away to show how cables and pipes are arranged.\" 95 The Dominion Bridge Company left the derrick crane on site. A presentation on \"the original concept of Habitat and similar 'multi-unit dwellings' in a planned community, designed by Moshe Safdie\" wa s mounted inside four of the unfinished North Cluster units.96 Audio tapes of \"post -mortem meetings\", during which Safdie and his consultants evaluated lessons learnt at Habitat, were played inside one of the units \"so that people could come in and listen to discussions about the structure\" while nearby \"several students answered questions from the thousands of people who visited the exhibit every day.\" 97 The exhibit was sponsored by over twenty -five 95 Expo 67 Press Service, \"Expo's Forgotten Exhibit\", 3. 96 Ibid. 132-133. \"post were, in fact, study seminars organised by Safdie in late March 1967, when he joined the contractors and consulting engineers to evaluate experiences gained during design and construction. In outlining the proposed meetings, Safdie wrote: \"The purpose of the seminars is to discuss the following: 'If you were to do this project again, what would you change in order to achieve greater economy, ease of construction or speed of construction?'\" See: Safdie, \"Habitat Study Seminars\" 58/191/PF15/20, Moshe Safdie Archive, Canadian Architecture Collection, McGill University; Moshe S afdie; \"Habitat: a Post -Mortem\", Journal of the Royal Institute of British Architects (November 1967): 492- 494. Safdie's consulting engineer August Komendant st-construction assessment; 1968): 138 -147. The students helping direct visitors to the Habitat exhibition distributed a \"Public Opinion Survey\" that asked fairgoers whether they would raise their children in Habitat, if they felt there was adequate privacy, and what they thought of the facilities. The survey additionally requested each respondent's requisite vital statistics, such as age, sex, income, and whether or not he or she presently owned or rented a house and where it was in terms of populat ion and the type of city, suburb, or countryside. See: \"Habitat 67 - Public Opinion Survey\", Box PF19, Folder 58/191/PF15/20, Moshe Safdie Archive, Canadian Architecture Collection, McGill Univers ity. 376 suppliers of materials and labour to Habitat.98 Despite the absence of a functioning factory, the line leading from display units, to hoisting machines, to the unfinished cluster, and finally to the built - and now partially occupied - complex made plausible the idea that the second phase of most vaunted project at Expo 67 was, indeed, imminent. The Construction Exhibition valorised the most durable of all postwar consumer symbols, even in the age of cars and televisions - the single -family house. \"The houses which form Habitat '67 provide their occupants with a means of preserving their identity within an urban community\", the CCWE announced, echoing Safdie's original quest to balance the valences of public and private life unfolding in city and suburb. 99 Promotional sketches showed a single dwelling with its own garden terrace, where a family relaxed amidst unmistakably contemporary furnishings (fig. 6.18). The quest of \"preserving\" the future inhabitant's \"identity\" presupposed a quality of taste-making. As Habitat 67 neared completion, Safdie had sought to organise international designers to provide ideas on finishing the North Cluster units.100 Yet under pressure from 98 With the contractors Anglin -Norcross and Francon Lt d as well as the Dominion Bridge Company, the contributors included: Frigidaire Products of Canada, makers of the prefabricated kitchen units; companies such as Metropolitan Drywall Limited, Polar Air Conditioning Company Ltd, the Singer Plumbing and Heati ng Company, and the Canadian Asbestos Company; David, Box Folder 58/191/PF15/28, Moshe Safdie Archive, Canadian Architecture Collection, McGill University. To a casual observer, the extensive list of sponsors may well have suggested that Habitat 67 did not achieve Safdie's desire for a totally industrialised process - that is, one built without the impact of different building trades. 99 Canadian Corporation for the 1967 World Exhibition, Habitat 67 , n.p. 100 Safdie recalled: \"From the beginning I was aware that when we'd get to furnish the exhibit units I would run into problems, the thing being furnished in a way which I felt was not up to the project. And so, in negotiating the contract with Expo I insisted on a clause that says that I had the design authority over the furnishing of all the areas in the building which were open to the public, not the individual houses which were rented but the 377 the Canadian Home Furnishings trade group, and seeking to emphasise that Habitat was a uniquely Canadian contribution to the fair, the CCWE invited the women's magazine Chatelaine to co -ordinate the designs of the unfinished unit interiors. The result was a hodgepodge of twenty -six \"Display Houses\" in the North Cluster, decorated in \"Bachelor - Eskimo Motif\", \"French Provincial and Wrought with Steel and Glass\", or the \"'Circa 75' Home Entertainment of the Future\", among others. 101 The remarkable variety of styles stacked atop one another may well have approximated the predilections of an actual community. 102 While insisting that for \"both house plans and room sizes we met current Canadian standards of middle -class families\", Safdie was aghast at the Chatelaine contribution. He found the choices of furniture both uninspired and dreary.103 In solidarity with Safdie, the Advisory Committee on Architecture had demanded the furnishings \"show as broad a range of living activities as possible, by including areas such as studios and children's room and should include displays such as quality Canadian toys\"; public areas\". See: Safdie, \"Session of March 22, 1968\", Interview Transcript : 64, Box PF22, Moshe Safdie Archive, Canadian Architecture Collection, McGill University. 101 After much wrangling wi th the CCWE, Safdie manage d to be put in charge of inviting some designers to furnish the display units. Safdie's recollection of what he dismissively called the \"Chatelaine Affair\" appears in Beyond Habitat , 135-141. 102 Despite his utter disdain for the Chatelaine commission, Safdie admitted that \"the ideal would be real tenants doing their own places rather than having them 'decorated'.\" His opposition stemmed from what he perceived as opting for mediocrity when faced with a unique opportunity to showca se design innovation. See: Safdie, Beyond Habitat , 140-141 103 Safdie, Habitat (1967), 20. On the apparent preference for modern styles over the eclectic Chatelaine furnishings, Safdie noted: \"The reaction when people came to Habitat was really at the end very rewarding, because the average man knew the difference to the point since there were credits at the entrances saying who designed it, you'd get people walking into a unit saying Oh its another Chatelaine, let's not look at that and would go out and these were lay people. This really proved something.\" See: Safdie, \"Session of March 22, 1968\", Interview Transcript , 72. 378 this emphasis on the tangible qualities of quotidian life would translate into thinking of the rooms as \"stage settings\", where \"the visitor can walk through and sit in the various rooms. Roping off display areas is not considered satisfactory\". 104 Instead, the Chatelaine units wer e explained by an official Expo 67 hostess stationed inside each unit, guiding visitors along a prescribed path marked by ropes. Even if many of the installed styles were retrograde, the popular narrative became one of discovering a genuinely modern domest ic environment. While the magazine Canadian Builder elsewhere dismissed Safdie's attempt at industrialised building as a \"gimmick\", it otherwise swooned over the Habitat interiors: \"As the Expo visitor enters the door these stark units suddenly transform into bright, ultra -modern individual homes\", with their \"look -of- tomorrow\" prefabricated kitchens and bathrooms. 105 In a promotional booklet, the CCWE featured house plans with corresponding images of only those units having the most up -to- date furniture, o ften Canadian -made and similar to Danish teak furniture being imported for a middle -class market (fig. 6.19). Many of the CCWE's photographs of the interiors - including a room with furnishings by Herman Miller - were reprinted in magazines worldwide. Vi ews of the prefabricated kitchen and bathroom - both \"custom designed 104 \"Habitat Furnishing\", Meeting of the Montreal Sub -Committee of the Advisory Committee on Architecture (September 16, 1966): 2, Box PK-290, Fonds John Parkin, Canadian Centre for Architecture. An appendix to the meeting minutes noted that the CCWE had established a Habitat Furnishing Committee that \"assumed the responsibility of furnishing 26 units in approximately seven furniture st yles\" - a mandate the Advisory Committee on Architecture found distasteful. 105 \"Habitat 67 - an Expensive Gimmick or a Serious Pl an for Mass -produced Housing?\", 65. 379 'showpieces'\", the CCWE asserted - received special attention.106 Each stood as proof of renewed faith in a kind of a functionalism, stemming from an ethos of existenzminimum , in which th e chores of domestic life were seen as thoroughly reorganised (eliminating drudgery with an incipient Taylorism) by way of improved and industrially made interiors.107 If the Construction Exhibition had focused on the more heroic aspect of Habitat 67 - that is, imparting the impression of an effortless mechanism for building \"boxes\" as the beginnings of a radically new urban form - then the tour through its interiors served to reinforce that here were \"houses\" like any other. CRITIQUE The argument for Habitat 67 as avatar of late modern life rested on social and technological norms, namely the nuclear family and prefabrication. \"It would not be correct to say Habitat presupposes a new way of living, a new urban society\", opined Canadian Architect; \"it is, or could be with the addition of its missing community or communal components, very much in tune with the life of our times.\" 108 Nevertheless, as advanced under the cultural imprimatur of a world's fair and financed by government, Habitat 67 was presumably freed from the nettlesome constraints of the marketplace. This privileged status - and an immediate useful value as permanent housing - led to deeply divided criticism. 106 Canadian Corporation for the World Exhibition, Habitat 67 , n.p. 107 The salutary example was Grette Sch\u00fctte -Lihotzky's \"existenzminimum kitchen\" designed for the German modernist Ernst May's housing estates built in Frankfurt in the late 1920s. 108 James A. Murray, \"Habitat 67: The Critical Eye 1\", Canadian Architect (October 1967): 36. 380 There was little doubt that Habitat 67 was audacious. The editor of the Journal of the Prestressed Concrete Institute described it as \"at once a research project, a mock -up prototype - and an exciting structure of the future that is certain to be a significant architectural milestone.\"109 When discussing the \"exotic structures\" at Expo 67 , the British weekly Engineering wrote that it \"regards Habitat as probably the most ambitious single project Expo\" and the \"revolutionary ideas incorporated are bound to yield useful information, especially with regard to concrete precasting techniques an d planning\"; nevertheless, it was \"less optimistic\" than those who \"regard this daring concept as the prototype of a new way of solving the housing problem suffered by many nations.\"110 Conversely, the editor of Canadian Architect unambiguously noted, in an issue devoted to Habitat just before the close of Expo 67: \"Significantly executed attempts to rethink the design phenomenon of dwelling densely could be counted on the fingers of one hand - Marseilles' Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation, Sheffield's Park Hill, possibly Stockholm's Taby Nasbydal or Philadelphia's Mill Creek - and still leave over a forefinger to point to Moshe Safdie's Habitat.\" 111 Even as they suggested a complete departure from technical, if not social, norms, the appraisals pointed precisely to where cr iticism (whether national or international) 109 \"Editorial\", Journal of the Prestressed Concrete Institute (February 1967): 61. Several months later, Habitat 67 was among the winners of the Institute's Annual Awards. 110 \"Expo 67: the Exotic Structures\", in Engineering (London, 13 January 1967): 63. 111 Murr ay, \"Habitat 67: The Critical Eye 1\", 35. The special issue included Hans Elte, \"Habitat 67: The Critical Eye 2\"; \"Habitat: detailed technical evaluation; and Safdie's article \"The Anatomy of a Building System\". Murray remarked in passing: \"Habitat is a phenomenon most heartening in a nation unmarked by housing innovation since the disappearance of the wigwam, a nation, moreover, which (last in the western world) reluctantly accepted a minute government responsibility for social housing.\" 381 would be most divided: as soon the fair opened, critics swiftly and repeatedly began to ask whether Habitat 67 could actually transcend its didactic function as prototype. The question was pressing, not least wit h Safdie and the CCWE assiduously showcasing Habitat alongside its means of production. As panacea for both urban overcrowding and suburban decentralisation, Habitat offered a powerful vision of the beneficial use of technology. \"But now there is Habitat - an accomplished fact\", declared Architectural Forum when, in light of Safdie's project, it explained how \"the notion of building with boxes is recognized as a realistic alternative\": \"And suddenly, the idea\" - that is, \"to assemble multistory structures by piling prefabricated boxes upon prefabricated boxes\" - \"is no longer a pipe dream.\" 112 The concept of \"piling prefabricated boxes\" implied that the aesthetic, social, and technological programmes of Habitat were commensurate to the maximising tendencies symbolised by its precasting factory. Safdie had assumed this when translating D'Arcy Thompson's notion of \"close packing\" as a way to realise both a genuine social and technical \"economy\" (Safdie's preferred term) through design.113 Yet for the 112 \"Habitat and After\", Architectural Forum (May 1967). The special feature on prefabrication was divided in three parts: \"Experimenting with Boxes\", which looked specifically at Habitat; construction; and \"Building with Boxes\", which examined the actual building of a pharmaceutical plant with shipping containers. For a discussion on the circulation and polemic al use of images of Habitat 67 in the 1960s, see: Hubert Beringer, \"La m\u00e9diatisation d'Habitat 67 et le moderne\", in Jean moderne: Image, usage, heritage (Saint Publications de l'Universit\u00e9 de Saint -Etienne, 2005) , 323-328. 113 Upon completing Habitat 67 and returning to his concept of \"Economy\" (interpreted through D'Arcy Thompson's \"morphology\" ) Safdie stated: \"I would translate the political reality of our time to a statement that economy is moral obligation to the builder and designer today... in fact it's Le Corbusier and [Buckminster] Fuller who are the first generation that lived with that political reality and if economy is a moral obligation then technology is a political necessity because it's the only way of providing more for more people or providing solutions which are applicable to all people, at least certain minimum solutions applicable to all people. I'm not suggesting in any way that means everybody should have the same 382 Canadian Architect critics, Habitat hardly fulfilled this promise, having been always compromised by \" Formverlangen , that is the desire for form, a form which could create an image, and it is astonishing to note what frantic technological efforts had to be made to cling to that image.... One is left with the conviction that the preponderant emphasis on form failed to put prefabrication of apartment units on a rational basis and so sharpen the techniques needed to produce mass housing\". 114 Moreover, \"doubling or tripli ng its 12 - storey heights (if technically possible) would leave the density unaffected if the basic cross - section of the complex continues to recognize Habitat's primary objective - a terraced garden for each dwelling unit stacked up the sloping pyramid of its cross-sectional geometry\".115 The accusation - of aestheticising the effects of serialised production, or the surrender of \"technique\" to \"image\" - further suggested that the dwelling unit (the \"cell\" from which Safdie believed his project would \"grow\") could never meet the demands of urban density, something Habitat was otherwise publicised as achieving. Thus, Canadian Architect noted, while Habitat may have appeared \"to any visitor\" as \"an apartment block of unusual interest\" it was finally nothing mo re than \"an assembly of penthouses\".116 The charge was not directed against the capaciousness of the dwelling. Indeed, the \"contribution\" of Habitat environment or that everything as to be even.\" See: Safdie, \"Session of April 17, 1968\", Interview Transcript, 23, Box PF22, Moshe Safdie Archive, Canadian Architecture Collection, McGill University. 114 Hans Elte, \"Habitat 67: The Critical Eye 2\", Canadian Architect (October 1967): 37. 115 Murray, \"Habitat 67: The Critical Eye 1\", 35. 116 Elte, \"Habitat 67: The Critical Eye 2\", 36. 383 was certainly \"a more humanistic attitude towards resident- oriented mass dwellings\".117 Instead, the critici sm suggested that the Habitat \"house\" was, as a new type of urban dwelling, still inadequate to its task of actualising the needs of the city. This was both a social and an economic critique. The indictment of \"penthouses\" implied that Habitat 67 was, for now, limited exclusively to a certain class of occupants - despite its promoted assembly -line construction, critics believed that the housing project did little to achieve a genuine \"economy\" of construction. The final cost was $22,195,920; or, as Canadi an Architect further noted, echoing many similar observations, a unit cost of \"approximately $140,000; the cost of 8 rowhouses.\"118 The CCWE had, of course, consistently reminded that the outlay for the housing exhibit was far higher than once its fabricati on system became perfected, and Safdie had early maintained that the Habitat \"components\" were treated as \"highly sophisticated industrialized products, even when unit costs could only eventually be reduced by increasing quantities to 1,000, 5,000 or even 10,000 units.\" 119 Nevertheless, repeated comparisons between the Habitat dwelling unit and existing housing types - affordably made by conventional construction methods, as many critics insisted on noting - implied that the impossibly high expenditure for tooling and 117 Ibid. 118 Ibid., 38. 119 Expo 67 Press Service, \"Hab itat Project Gets Green Light\", 2 ; Safdie, \"Habitat 67\" (September -December 1965): 4. The argument on achieving economies of scale in materials was assumed related to the refinement of labour practices. Safdie later claimed that construction was only at \"10 per cent efficiency\": \"We were ke pt at this low efficiency because we had to train workers for every job. Every operation on the project was totally new to them, and inevitably it required time for them to adapt. Because labour is half the cost of a building, this made considerable difference in the cost of Habitat.\" See: Moshe Safdie quoted in Robert Fulford, This Was Expo (Toronto: McClelland and Stewart, 1968): 114 . 384 plant, combined with the low densities resulting from aesthetic proclivities, necessarily resulted in a work without broad social applicability.120 On this, Safdie equivocated. In the first Schematic Report for Habitat, the development consultants had assumed that rents would be targeted to an \"upper and middle income group\" - a necessity for underwriting \"Phase 1\" (the \"prototype\"). Safdie later adopted this line when considering the post-Expo disposal of Habitat, recommending that a \"Trust Company be given the project for disposal on a Condominium basis\" and in \"establishing the purchase price of the units consideration should be given to the fact that Habitat should be lived in by middle income (or upper middle income) families, preferably wit h children.\" 121 Yet when first promoting his design in 1965, he had been unsure about the socio-economic target: What kind of housing is Habitat? Is it low, middle, or high -income housing? Habitat is a building method to provide housing for everyone. As an urban form, it must accommodate the entire range of income groups. To isolate it and consider it as a form catering to one of the groups only would be to imply its lack of universality. 122 120 Symptomatic of the criticism levelled against Habitat 67 as somehow proving the need for industrialised building was an article by Bernard P. Spring, Director of the Research Centre for Urban and Environmental Planning in the School of Architecture at Princeton University. Spring insisted : \"it is claimed that the industrialized production methods used could produce com petitively priced apartments if there were enough of a market. This is a very ancient and tired argument by the proponents of industrialized housing that should not have the power to fool anyone. But it does.... If there were a contest between a prefabri cator and a good conventional builder, I would bet that the conventional builder would turn in lower costs. In that case the conventional builder would profit from the economies of scale without having to bear the costs of retraining labor and management, or of setting up new transportation, distribution, and financing systems.\" See: Spring, \"Is There a Habitat in Your Future?\", Journal of the American Institute of Planners (November 1967): 418. 121 Moshe Safdie, \"Considerations in the Disposal of Habitat 67 and Mackay Pier\" (November 22, 1966): 1, Box PF19, Folder 58/191/PF15/20, Moshe Safdie Archive, Canadian Architecture Collection, McGill University. When preparing his memorandum Safdie knew that condominiums were not yet legal in Quebec. 122 Safdie, \"Habitat 67\" (September -December 1965), 6. The socio -economic status of Habitat had been questioned right from the start. Oscar Newma n, who had helped develop the Man in the City theme at Safdie's invitation, and who had chronicled the Team 10 meeting Ot terlo in 1959, penned an early appraisal of the first Habitat scheme in October 1964 . Newman's critique presented passages from the Habitat 67 385 Maintaining that \"low -cost housing\" has \"to do more with the fi nancing of housing than with its construction\", Safdie claimed that the only way to \"provide the most housing to all people\" (\"for less labor and less material\") was \"by the introduction of new methods of construction\". Moreover, while \"there is no questi on that it would be cheaper to use the construction method of Habitat by building vertical towers along double loaded corridors\" and that \"there is also no question that higher densities than Habitat have been constructed\", the imperative was to \"offer to the family, to the public, at least some of the amenities\" - the conventions of suburbia informing Safdie since A Case for City Living - \"which they have at present.\" 123 In other words, Habitat encapsulated desires already prevalent in society. Moreover, g iven its very form, it \"sets a standard\" (a social one) and \"introduces a method of construction which will make that standard possible.\"124 Moreover, \"if it is the economist's Feasibility Study of February 1964, after which he offered a point -by-point rebuttal. In singling out the claim \"To build economically is a social and political aspect of our time\", Newman retorted that the excessive per unit costs, the unrealistically low price of land, the low promised return on equity for developers, and the foreseen high rents, all made the pro ject utterly unrealistic, thus adding: \"The housing picture for the upper classes looks very rosy indeed.\" See: Oscar Newman, \"Habitat 67: A Critique\", Canadian Architect (October 1964): 43. The paradigm of a \"prototype\", as developed by Safdie and the C CWE, was to inoculate Habitat 67 against precisely this kind of criticism. 123 Safdie noted that \"Stuyvesant Town in New York has a density 50% higher than that of Habitat 67.\" While recognising that Habitat achieved lower densities than typical urban ty pes, he had also positioned Habitat in categorical opposition to suburban patterns of land use - a view he illustrated repeatedly in an oft -published \"density comparison\" diagram that juxtaposed Habitat with see: Safdie, \"Habitat 67\" (September -December 1965) , 13. With the opening of Expo 67, Safdie was further emboldened to see his prototype as a total replacement to suburban living. Speaking to a Vancouver audience in early May 1967, he predicted that in ten years the single- family house will no longer be the predominant form of housing. See: \"Suburbia's on the Way Out Says Expo Habitat Designer\", Vancouver Sun (12 May 1967): 34. 124 Moshe Safdie, \"Habitat 67\" ( September 6. Safdie further qualified his new \"standard\": \"It cannot be evaluated within the short range implications of the first construction program of 160 dwelling units.\" 386 responsibility to establish some of these standards, it is the architect who mus t give the image the physical interpretation\".125 The \"method\" was the refinements achieved by industrialised building; but it was only the architect's privileged compositional acuity (notwithstanding the ensuing critique of Formverlangen ) that could make mass production a redemptive force, thereby actualising an \"image\" of society - precisely what the Expo 67 mandate sought to approximate or, really, to foretell. The production of units, cells, boxes, or, indeed, \"houses\" was now meant to be the paramount achievement of Habitat. Arts & Architecture , the magazine most associated with promoting the Case Study House programme (which ran from 1945 to 1966 and aimed to establish the modern, often prefabricated, home as the preeminent type for middle -class America), passingly dismissed Expo 67 as \"an expensive display of conceptual poverty, a $300-million frug, a middle -aged archidelic freak -out\": \"World's Fairs tend to stew the architect in his own juices\"; nevertheless, Habitat 67, it concluded, \"is one of a few projects indicating an attempt to spend millions responsibly.\" 126 The demand of responsibility was not explained by a detailed analysis of Habitat; rather, it was deliberately constructed around the inclusion of Habitat in an issue specifically devoted to industrialised building, with Safdie's project shown alongside examples such as Herbert Ohl's prefabricated systems advanced at the Hochschule f\u00fcr Gestaltung in Ulm, Ezra Ehrenkrantz's celebrated Schools Construction Systems Development (SCSD) project in C alifornia, advances in \"pods\" and 125 Moshe Safdie, -December 1965) 6. 1967): of 1907 with the aluminium pyramidal geodetic structure of the Gyrotron funhouse at Expo 67), the space frames pioneer Konrad Wachsmann's polem ic on \"Research: Knud Lonberg -Holm's article \"Architecture in the Industrial Age\" (an unpublished piece of 1929 that was, as an editorial aside noted, originally rejected by Architectural Record for being too controversial). Suggesting an alternative trajectory in modernism premised on the ideal of mass production, a contextualising polemic was given in the architecture critic Allen Temko's introductory essay, \"Building the Great Society: The Challenge to the Construction Industry\" by. A self -professed \"radical who would like to see sweeping changes in our environment\", Temko drew on key contemporary cultural concepts - \"our 'open' society\" and the \"New Frontier\" - to argue that only the experimental methods of industrialised building could activate the socio -cultural programmes commensurate to the \"Great Society\" (the set of domestic programmes enacted by President Lyndon B. Johnson to eliminate, among other thing, poverty and racial injustice in the United States). 127 Suggesting simultaneously the technological sublime of the Space Race (John F. Kennedy's \"New Frontier\") as well as the philosopher Karl Popper's 127 Allen Temko, \"Buil ding the Great Society: The Challenge to the Construction Industry\", Arts & Architecture (April 1967): 8 -9. Temko's credential as a West Coast \"radical\" had been bona fide since his inclusion as Roland Major in Jack Kerouc's novel On the Road of 1957. Te mko and Kerouc were friends as undergraduates at Columbia University. Temko first published Building the Great Society: the Challenge to the Construction Industry as a \"working paper\" for the Center for Planning & Development Research at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1966; it was prepared for the symposium America's Private Construction Industry and the Future American City, held in Los Angeles in January 1966. 388 influential postwar critique of historicism (his anti- Hegelianism), Temko's prognostication on archite ctural advance served to describe a possibly new state in human affairs: Only now, as the Age of Communications, Services, and Automation succeeds the earlier period of mechanization, is the new society commencing to hit its full stride. Although it may e ventually enter a \"post -historic\" stage, in which its complex dynamics will be stabilized, it presently is in an exhilarating state of flux; its material demands are still apparently limitless; its cultural requirements, including the need for amenities of every conceivable kind, have not been clearly articulated. 128 Echoing what in other circles would soon be described as post -industrial society, Temko perceived a phase in which conflicts of \"history\" - the dialectic of, say, class struggle, or the uneven a ccess to knowledge or natural resources - could be realigned - and \"stabilized\" - through architecture itself; hence, the efficiencies promised by industrialised building would invent entirely new forms for the necessary reorganisation of social institutio ns. His preferred example was Ehrenkrantz's SCSD, which he singled out for two reasons: first, the engineer Robertson Ward's design of a lightweight, folding steel truss system for Inland Steel used in the SCSD schools; second, that this new challenge for architecture \"may come from market competitors\" but, in fact, demanded a \"different kind of push, much stronger\" that could \"come from the nation's intellectual leadership\" (fig. 6.20). 129 It was an appeal to an enlightened technocratic class - a situation already facing Safdie when contacted by the newly created United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). HUD invited Safdie to consider ways in which Habitat 67 could, even before its completion, 128 Ibid., 9. 129 Ibid., 10. SCSD was undertaken by the Educational Facilities Labor atory at Stanford University and sponsored by the Ford Foundation . 389 be used for Operation Breakthrough, a ne wly initiated programme for providing housing to lower income families by the large-scale use of industrialised building.130 The ambition was not unlike the hopes for Habitat 67: \"HUD officials believed that publicity form a large - scale demonstration of industrialized housing construction methods could be a catalyst in helping reduce or eliminate the complex housing industry problems\".131 This aligned 130 In June 1967, Safdie met with members of the United States Department o f Housing and Urban Development to discuss a \"Proposed Experimental Project for Washington, D.C.\". The \"main objective\" was \"to demonstrate the use of new building technology and design in the construction of housing for low -income families\", specifically by \"adapting the general concept of prefabricating complete dwelling units as conceived by Mr. Moshe Safdie for Ha bitat\". In establishing the project goals, the Office of Urban Technology and Research at HUD asked \"what assessments both technically and in terms of tenants and visitors reaction to Habitat were being undertaken.\" Upon being told by Safdie about the Habitat survey, the Office replied that it was \"extremely anxious to more about the responses which you received from your questionnaire.\" Safdie had, by this point, designed the HUD \"modular system\" project in collaboration with Conrad Engineers (with whom he would work on the aborted Habitat Puerto Rico). While the HUD project was never realised, Safdie described it as \"the first opportunity to change and modify the system after our Habitat post -mortems\", and concluded that it set the standards for financ ing and design of \"Operation Breakthrough\".

As the Comptroller General note d in hindsight , Operation Breakthrough was stymied by traditional labour practices, building codes, and land assembly problems; it \"did not prove the marketability of most of its sponsored housing construction methods, but it did support some u seful changes in the building industry\" (n.p.). The Demonstration Cities and Metropolitan Development Act of 1966 authorised HUD to undertake Operation Breakthrough. The ambition was not unlike what was hoped for Habitat 67: \"HUD officials believed that publicity form a large -scale demonstration of industrialized housing construction methods could be a catalyst in helping reduce or eliminate the complex housing industry problems\" (6). HUD was elevated to a cabinet agency in 1965, the very year of the Gre at Society programme that, in one of its very first announcements, during President Lyndon B. Johnson's commencement address at the University of Michigan on May 22, 1964, took urban renewal as a core aspect of the \"War on Poverty\": \"Our society will never be great until our cities are great. Today the frontier of imagination and innovation is inside those cities and not beyond their borders.\" See: Johnson, quoted in Christopher Klemek, The Transatlantic Collapse of Urban Renewal: Postwar Urbanism for New York to Berlin (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 2011) , 2. 390 perfectly with the kind of total programme sought by Safdie: a triad between the precision of the assembly line, the imagination of the architect (to conceive of \"combinations and permutation... within a repetitive construction\"), and the authority of an ideal commissioning agency (\"a complete small-scale government\" - here, a world's fair - that \"could integrate the design and manufacture of thousands of different elements... and improve them through research\"). 132 Critics similarly acknowledged the authority of Expo 67 as uniquely suited to steering Habitat. As Canadian Architect observed: Complex social purpose, st andardized construction techniques, soaring building and site costs, fragmented patterns of land ownership, systems of finance, the organization of the development industry, conservative public acceptability, zoning and building codification, the very form of cities: all these factors constrain the normal processes of multiple housing design and result in predictable and universal stereotypes of slab and tower undifferentiated from Murmansk to Montreal.... Without Expo 67, Habitat would not exist except as a paper thesis among a goodly company of technical and social acrobatics.... Without Expo neither private development nor public purpose could have achieved this extraordinary statement of habitation.\" 133 Robin Boyd, the Australian architect and contributi ng editor to Architectural Record , similarly insisted that Habitat \"manages to convince as a little scrap of tomorrow\"; since \"this was the object of the exercise as an Expo exhibit, almost any price paid in practical building discomfort and economies was prejustified.\" 134 The Architectural Review likewise argued that 132 Safdie, \"Why not Utopia?\", 15. 133 Murray, \"Habitat 67: The Critical Eye 1\", 35. 134 Robin Boyd, \"Habitat's Cluster\", Architectural Forum (May 1967): 39. Boyd's article appeared in a special issue on \"Habitat and After\", which looked at advances in prefabrication and industrialised building. He was a well-known critic during the 1960s, and had been a visiting professor at MIT in 1956- 1957. Boyd prepared the monograph Kenzo Tange (New York: George Braziller, 1962), thus allowing him to compare Safdie's work to Tange's Tokyo Bay and Boston Harbour projects. 391 despite \"the cost\" of each Habitat house as built\" (which \"puts them in the luxury class\"), the very purpose \"of an exhibition is to make experiments that would not be economically justified in other contexts\"; thus, \"a lot will be learnt\" from Habitat, \"including the lessons about how to improve the planning and construction system it employs.\" 135 In a \"post - mortem\" published in Progressive Architecture, Safdie's consulting engineer August Komen dant described flaws in design, fabrication, and construction, but otherwise concluded that \"Habitat, as built, proves that it could be realized only within the framework of Expo 67 because the funds were available\", although it \"could have been built in its own right within reasonable time and economical limits if there had been a single executive authority completely in charge of all phases of the project. This authority would need up-to - date technical knowledge and be well experienced in construction an d mass -production methods.\" 136 The vacuum of the world's fair - as an institution set apart from the typical demands of capital - was presumed necessary not only to initiating Habitat 67 - as \"prototype\" - but for suggesting some kind of technocratic agency - for example, HUD - capable of organising the built environment. As much an argument on the economic base of society, the idea of an enlightened use of technology by statist enterprise was, in terms of architecture culture, also to confront a category o f the avant-garde - namely, \"paper thesis\" statements on contemporary megastructures as forms of critique, thus seen as standing outside everyday life by virtue of \"technical and social acrobatics\" positing an alternative, 135 \"Habitat\" and \"Theme and Permanent Buildings\", The Architectural Review (August 1967): 143, 136. 136 Komendant, \"Post -Mortem on H abitat\", 147. 392 largely improbable, reality. Key works informing Safdie, and influencing the early Expo 67 master plans, belonged to these visions, in which an aestheticisation of technology inevitably masked any differentiation between utopian and pragmatic aspects; the most extreme examples offered a world in which social life would be in constant, irrational agitation with economics, government and industrial production sequestered in a state of automated perfection. 137 While not unsympathetic to such sentiments, Safdie offered a prognosis on society u shered by an enlightened liberal state - ideally operating outside the short-term goals of politics - as the agent of social reform via architecture. The \"framework\" offered by Komendant was, then, an ultimate vision on organising design and machines to produce environments free of unevenness and irregularity - thus, commensurate to the world's fair thematic of a post-corporatist and post- nationalist \"world\", with the housing exhibition representing, however artificially, the kind of \"post -historic\" zeitge ist projected by Temko and others. SYSTEMS Appraisals of Habitat 67 located it between its relative success as a factory -made building and its potential as a new form of the modern city. In 1965, Safdie still assumed that \"we must await completion of the project before discussing and evaluating its social implications\".138 137 Alan Colquhoun, Modern Architecture (Oxford: Oxford Safdie, \"Habitat 67\" ( September -December, 1965), 6. 393 By early 1967, as Habitat stood almost finished - and believed to be only the first of future phases - he concluded: In the construction of an environment, the problem presented by mass production is how to achieve a variety of spaces required in the make-up of the city; how to achieve a variety of house types; how to achieve a variety in the patterns and groupings of the elements of the city to avoid monotony, without sacrificing the prerequisites of repetitive use of similar elements.\" 139 Of these three \"problems\", Safdie saw Habitat treating the latter two: the creation of a \"single standardized three -dimensional precast component\" and its use \"as the repetitive modular construction element\". 140 The project - as architecture, as ethos - was now \"Habitat 67 - Towards the Development of a Building System\".141 Safdie's invocation of standardisation , followed discussions on \"building systems\" rife in architecture culture by the mid -1960s. Building systems referred to an array of components and the rules for putting them together; as such, commodities like housing - which demanded economies of scale for growing populations and urban needs - could be renewed at an increasing pace. 142 At the close of Expo 67, Safdie asserted: \"A building system is not only a means to end; it is a form of organisation.\" \"Systems\", he added, \"are a way of approaching the environment\" - housing, a world's fair, the city - \"as a t otal, complex organism, of discovering an order which, once established, would preserve those 139 Safdie, \"Habitat 67 - Towards the Development of Building System\", 60. This was also the title of a paper Safdie delivered at a Prestressed Concrete Institute Convention in Houston 140 Ibid., 60-61. 141 Ibid., 62 . 142 Barry Russell, Building Systems, Industrialization, and Architecture ( London and New York: Wiley, 1981): 647ff. 394 aspects of the environment which we consider essential.\"143 The argument was not simply on the rationalisation of construction, a deeply held principle of the Mode rn Movement, but to see design as a stemming from the interrelatedness of things - hence the belief in biological models like D'Arcy Thompson's \"holism\".144 Natural systems - such as molecular cells - were especially attractive given that these were processes embodied in physical containers and actual forms; in other words, they were analogous to building elements. By \"imitating the morphological process\" found in nature, architects would, Safdie believed, \"automatically stop looking at buildings as single entities\"; instead, they \"would have to think of cities as systems, as building systems.\" 145 This shared with modernist functionalism a belief in achieving an organic unity of culture; where it differed was in challenging idealist diagrams of space - nature versus technology - by aesthetic, social, and technological categories in which all aspects were inextricably bound to one another. \"Building system\" referred not only to the celebrated assembly -line construction of Habitat but invoked ascendant ideas of systems building in architecture and systems theory in the postwar human sciences. Both regarded design as a process accepting \"input\" from any number of sources, whether public taste, terms of financing, or technological innovation. Developed by Austria n biologist Ludwig von Bertalanffy, \"General Systems Theory\" offering 143 Safdie, \"On from H abitat\", 45. 144 Francis Ferguson, Architecture, Cities and the Systems Approach (New York: George Braziller, 1975): 40ff. Ideas of holism or homeostasis in biology assumed an organism regulated by internal conditions so as to preserve a permanent state of equilibrium (thus a self -regulating system). 145 \"Building a City with King Kong Blocks\", 231. 395 a \"theory of organisation\" applicable to any number of social, economic, or technological questions.146 Increasingly popular in the 1960s (with a particularly rapt American audience, not least given the application to war gaming scenarios being developed for the war in Vietnam), systems theory was the application of the principle of biological self -regulation to machines and society. The view was common to the rising science of cybernetic s, which sought in the principle of \"feedback\" a way of maintaining things in equilibrium thereby forever increasing their \"performance\".147 Broadly applied to the social realm, systems analysis was believed to offer a long- term \"good\" achieved by calculation and measurement (and as opposed to, say, politics, which sought only short-term success). The construction of \"wholes\" - social systems, economic models, machines, or architectural works - rested on maintaining a continuous flow of information (or user input). With Habitat nearing completion, Safdie offered that a \"building system is not only a means to an end\" but it is a \"form of organisation\"; systems thinking could thus lead to an \"order\" that, once established, 146 Ludwig von Bertalanffy, \"General Systems Theory: A Critical Review\", in General Systems, Yearbook of the Society for the Advancement of General Systems Resear ch 7(1962), 1-20. 147 Norbert W iener, The Human of Human Beings: Cybernetics and Society (1950; New York: Avon Books, 1967). \"S ystems\" also tied to broader considerations on \"management\" - whether applied to abstractions such as the economy or the actual conditioning of people and the husbandry of resources. For Safdie, this kind of organisational \"feedback\" was also a way to reconsider approaches to design: \"The relationship of the architect, who is designing the assembled complex; the industrial engineer who is designing the product itself; the contractor who assembles them, must be transformed into a single organization. This organization would develop systems of building, manufacturing all parts, undertaking basic research, marketing on an internati onal scale. We have, then, two levels of design. The design of the building system evolving new vernacular to satisfy our building requirements, and its application to a specific area.\" See: Safdie, \"Why not Utopia?\", 11 The rising managerial aspect of systems thinking in the early 1960s marked the \"bright young men\" of the Kennedy administration, who propagated the Vietnam War through techniques of \"role playing\" or \"war gaming\" earlier \"operational rese arch\" during the World War Two. The establishment of \"think tanks\" such as the RAND Corporation was tied to military planning; during the Vietnam War, members of RAND worked for Robert McNamara at the Department of Defense, where systems thinking flourish ed. 396 would preserve these \"aspects of the environment\" an architect considered \"essential\".148 In principle, the creation of \"order\" grew from the introduction of a self -regulating element into the way large buildings and, by extension, cities were conceived. For Safdie, this component had always been the \"dwelling unit\" that, fixed by constraints of mass production, could serve as the basis of an ever -expanding environment. Safdie's view on systems owed to his earlier immersion in the Dutch line of Team 10. Under Aldo van Eyck, the Dutch \"structuralist\" tendency was marked by a search for forms that could change with time while retaining their coherence and \"meaning\".149 Van Eyck's Amsterdam Orphanage, which had so influenced Safdie as a student, epitomised structuralist precepts of using repeatin g - and prefabricated - modular cells to create clusters signifying both \"house\" and \"city\" in continuum. This condition of being \"both/and\", in van Eyck's phraseology, informed Safdie's sense of \"systems\" that emerged from a set of \"synonyms\" he gave to \"the word structure\" (which, in turn, followed from understanding \"morphological process\"): \"integration, articulation, concatenation, organisation, arrangement, system, organism, scheme, and complex. Each of these words must form the broadest programmati c base in our design of the urban texture.\" 150 Semantically, this approximated the increasingly 148 Safdie, Habitat\", Modern Architecture Wim van Heuval, Structuralism in Dutch Architecture (Rotterdam: 010 Publishers, 1992) , 15. 150 Moshe Safdie, \"Why not Utopia? Part 2: Proposals and Requirements\", 6. Law Whyte, whose theories influenced Safdie, had written: \"The word 'form' has many meanings, such as shape, configuration, structure, pattern, organisation, and system of relations.... Common to the idea of form, configuration, pattern, and structure is the notion of ordered complexity, a multiplicity which is governed by some unifying principle.\" See: Whyte, \"Introduction\", Aspects of Form: A Symposium on Form in Nature and Art , 2. In a similar vein, Gyorgy Kepes also provided an expanded sense of \"structure\". When discussing what he called the 397 popular \"method\" of analysis, ascendant in linguistics and the social sciences, known as Structuralism, which sought the existence of elementary signifying forms (from myth to grammar) out of which variety (cultures and languages) was generated. In this, structuralism would share with systems theory the desire to find in the natural sciences models (really, analogies) expressing both the dynamic transformation an d the conservation of any given totality (a \"whole\"). When contemporaneously defining structuralism as \"a system of transformations\", the Swiss psychologist and philosopher Jean Piaget crucially noted that von Bertalanffy derived his General Systems Theor y from earlier ground -breaking attempts \"to introduce an explicitly structuralist perspective into biology\" - proof of the Austrian biologist's \"organicism\"; he added: \"it can be maintained that in the morphological transformations which D'Arcy Thompson studied more than a generation ago life is geometrizing .\" 151 Von Bertalanffy's approach rested on introducing the principles of \"modulation of signals\", Kepes argued that \"the key techniques of our civilization are instrumentation based on the transformation of patterns into their structural analogues through modulation of signals\" - as prod uced, for instance, by the oscilloscope. Kepes concluded: \"Structure emerges as the key to our knowledge and control of our world - structure more than quantitative measure and more than relation between cause and effect.\" Kepes contextualised his defini tion with a footnoted reference to Whyte's books The Next Development of Man (Mentor Books, 1950) and The Unitary Principle in Physics and Biology (Henry Holt and Co., 1949). See: Kepes, The New Landscape in Art and Science (Chicag o: Paul Theobald and Co., 1956), 173. 151 Jean Piaget, Structuralism (1968; New York Harper Colophon Books, 1970), 5, 46 -47, 114; emphasis added. Donna Haraway observes that Piaget, a Swiss psychologist, \"felt that Ludwig von Bertalanffy, inspired by the work of Gestalt configura tions\" - for example, the aesthetic analogies for biological form derived by D'Arcy Thompson and others - \"was the first biologist seriously to explore the requirements of a structuralist organicism, which led to his 'general systems theory.'\" See: Harawa y, Crystals, Fabrics, and Fields: Metaphors of Organicism in Twentieth -Century Developmental Biology (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1976) , 61-63. Piaget referred expressly to Thompson's On Growth and , which, he noted, \"influenced L\u00e9vi -Strauss' earlier thought.\" The anthropologist Claude L\u00e9vi -Strauss saw social life as a system in which all aspects are linked with one another. Aldo van Eyck spoke purposely from the theoretical world of Structuralism and, given his own preoccupations with \"primitive\" cultures, was likely well versed in the theories of L\u00e9vi -Strauss. Arnulf L\u00fcchinger notes that while van Eyck may well have absorbed L\u00e9vi -Strauss, younger architects such as Herman Hertzberger turned to linguistic models of structuralism: \"Parallel to the concept of LANGUE ET 398 mechanics to biology (namely that biological laws must be expressed in physical-chemical terms).152 His organicism was rooted in Romantic conceptions on how the outward expression of any organism could express its internal organising principles. Indeed, Goethe was among the first to use \"morphology\" (among Safdie's preferred expressions) following studies in anatomy, botany, and mineralogy that revealed to him certain common patterns - \"the laws of transformation\" - underlying the modifications - that is, the shape and structure - of natural forms. 153 He considered science not simply as the quantitative ordering of things (that is, as taxonomy) but as an attempt to understand human experience. In short, biological principles were appropriate to describing technology, society, and aesthetics. Thus, \"geometrising\": Goethe's inheritance, extended through discourses on structuralism and sy stems, lay, for postwar architecture culture, in seeing form - a conjoined social and aesthetic concern - not as static but as dynamic and open to change. Seemingly technocratic, system was also to suggest a more archaic view on architecture. Safdie rema rked: PAROLE (language and speech), Hertzberger \"developed his own ideas on the topical subject of co - determination in housing: parole of the occupants\"; see: L\u00fcchinger, Structuralism in Urban Planning Kr\u00e4mer, 1981),19. 152 Haraway, Crystals, Fabrics, and Fields: Metaphors of Organicism in Twentieth -Century Developmental Biology, 26-27. 153 Ritterbush, The Art of Organic Forms, 7. Donna Haraway also observes that the Romantic view on \"form\" embodied \"all t he relations of the organism and expresses the whole and its internal organizing principles\" - which related to Goethe's early aesthetic conceptualisation of \"morphology\" - and became \"essentially the starting point for modern biology, not in the sense tha t the poets provided acceptable biological explanations of laws (which they surely did not), but in the sense that the artists and biologist face a common problem: creation of novelty and fundamental appreciation of the nature of organic form.\" See: Haraw ay, Crystals, Fabrics, and Fields: Metaphors of Organicism in Twentieth -Century Developmental Biology , 39ff. 399 People visiting Habitat were reminded of a Mediterranean village. That association was not rooted in formalism; it is generic in nature. The typical Aegean hill villages, the Arab hill towns, or the Indian pueblos are true building systems. They c onsist of a vocabulary of repetitive components - for example, the Arab village with its cubical room, dome, vault, and court. 154 Critics had, indeed, described Habitat as \"reminiscent of villages not far from Moshe Safdie's birthplace of Haifa\"; that it \"tried to capture something of the spontaneity of those villages and towns which have grown spontaneously in countries around the Mediterranean\"; or that here was a \"communal housing project that is half Indian pueblo in appearance, but is possibly the shape of the future.\" 155 While acknowledging the formal comparisons, Safdie insisted that \"vernacular architecture\" was akin to a \"building system\" because it followed \"the development of repetitive elements capable of combination and growth\" over time. 156 He thu s claimed that \"the vernacular of Habitat is not a dome or an adobe roof, but the standardized units themselves.\"157 The CCWE and Safdie always intended the precast box to forge a metabolic relation between visitor - the future inhabitant - and a dwelling u nit. Now, the prefabricated cell did something more: it situated Habitat \"in the tradition of spontaneous self -made environments, the beginnings of contemporary vernacular\". 158 On 154 Safdie, Beyond Habitat , \"Habitat's Blocks B uild a Better Environment\", in Engineering News- Record (June 16, 1966): 84. 156 Safdie, \"Why not Utopia?\", 6. 157 Safdie, Habitat (1967), 8. Safdie's idea of a \"vernacular\" as a \"system\" was likely inherited from Christopher Alexander, another preferred source. In his Notes on the Synthesis of Form (1964), Alexander describe d \"unselfconscious\" vernacular architecture as \"self -organising\". 158 Safdie, Beyond Habitat , 118. To Safdie, Habitat 67 was \"much more a vernacular system, a reaction against the idea o f individually- designed buildings on individual lots\". He thus turned to the \"vernacular\" to oppose 400 the one hand, the vernacular was adopted as a way to popularise ideas on pre fabrication and industrial building. On the other hand, while industrialisation broadly marked a dichotomy between traditional and modern society, Safdie's dovetailing of structure and vernacular was to suggest a renewal of human agency vis -\u00e0-vis the built environment. As Safdie began repeatedly to state, almost as a post-rationalisation, when Habitat 67 opened to visitors: I should say that people want their own identity to start with, they want to feel that they can shape their own personal environment, they can change it, modify it, they can choose it to start with, that it's not imposed on them and they like to feel that it has certain differentiation from others that it's not the same as everybody else because they are not the same as other people in fact the Utopian statement could be that houses and dwellings should be as different to each other as one human face and personality to the other, this is the idea and any system which imposes dwellings which are all identical on people they generally react to it. I think this is true of most societies; there are very few societies where conformity of the individual to the overall group is so strong that he does not have the need for identification. In fact, there are certain societies where the identification isn't to the individual but it may be to the immediate group like the Indian pueblo, the need to identify was probably more directed to the whole tribe\". 159 Returning to Safdie's earliest worries on the city versus the suburb, it remained unclear whet her his social paradigm was meant to err on side of the communal or the individual. If the equation between spontaneity, auto -construction, vernacular, and standardisation was a re-evaluation of Aldo van Eyck's \"organised casbah\", then it was without the Dutch architect's nostalgic sense of \"community\" - despite analogy to vernacular construction, the paradigm of \"open\" structures offered techniques toward a built world largely unimpeded by \"the tradition of what I would call the architect -designed building\", which was inherited from \"the Renaissance idea of an architect designing a building\" (9- 10). 159 Moshe Safdie, \" Session of April 7 and 8 \", Interview Transcript , 3-4, Box PF22, Moshe Safdie Archive, Canadian Architecture Collection, McGill University . 401 any a priori cultural codes.160 As users draw on the rationalising capacities of industrialised building in the form of the prefabricated cell, they were, in theory, offered the means to alter their own environment - and, therefore, their patterns of behaviour; this was the paradigm at its most anarchic. Still, the dovetailing of \"systems\" and \"structure\" was part and parcel of a broader tendency to substitute a new kind of \"organicist\" project - via models of wholeness and self -regulation - for the oppositional frameworks of modernism, whether in terms of the conflicts of history or, indeed, the functionalist (or mechanistic) ordering of space in which absolute values, like nature or technology, were clearly and consistently juxtaposed; this was the basis of Temko's turn to industrialised building as commensurate to a \"po st-historic\" phase in human civilisation. 161 Here, the aspiration for \"systems\" of self -building - predicated on the promise of unremitting mass production - jibed with emerging tendencies 160 Safdie, \"On from Habitat\", Design 226 (London, October Beyond Habitat , 150-151. 161 In terms of a critique of functionalism, Donna Haraway explains that gestalt (epitomised in modern architecture by Le Corbusier's \"engineer's aesthetic\") was seen by structuralists as neglecting history. In architecture culture, this was an opposition between functionalism (atomistic) and structuralism or systems (ways of seeing the relatedness of things). See: Haraway, Crystals, Fabrics, and Fields: Metaphors -Century Developmental Biology 62; Temko's \"post -historic\" society was contemporaneous with similar projections on \"the year 2000\". Symptomatic was the important \"2000+\" issue of Architectural Design , released in February 1967 and edited by John McHale, erstwhile acolyte of Buckminster Fuller, in which architecture was eclipsed by the \"New Symbiosis\" of cybernetics and the rise of the \"Communications Revolution\". The summer 1967 issue of Daedalus , the Journal of the American Society of Arts and Letters, published the findings of The Commission on the Year 2000 led by the sociologist Daniel Bell, who very soon became the polemicist of \"post -industrial society\". Safdie was not unaffected by this futurology and would appear at the 1969 annual convention of the Californian Council of the American Institute of Architects, which looked towards \"2000\" with Millenarianism had coloured Expo 67 as ushering a host of civic improvement following official pronouncements (never fulfilled) on Montreal becoming a city of five million people b y the year 2000. Indeed, the City Planning Department would, in 1967, produce its film Horizon 2000 , a remarkable audio -visual evocation - through the use of split- screens - of a multivolume report on the future of Montreal. 402 to describe the world as an \"information society\", a each formulation, primacy was accorded to \"knowledge\" and techno-science in the belief that social groups - and their built environments - could be constructed and managed in some equilibrium with no one level \"in control\". This was surely a utopian ambition. Yet if Habitat 67 was symbolic of the kind of social and spatial expansion presumed by \"systems\", then it inevitably pointed to a coming crisis. The role of the \"user\" in creating what Safdie had called a \"contemporary vernacular\" was premised on an open technological future. With the fallout from urban renewal schemes throughout North America and an ensuing global financial crisis by the early 1970s, \"users\" may have come to wonder whether their spaces were really meant to be conceived , to be forever built anew; or, should these have quite simply been appropriated, as found in the existing conditions of the traditional city. Habitat 67 was finally an argument on technological innovation as the basis for social change. Seemingly evolved outside the normal processes of history - namely, in the ideal space of a world's fair - Habitat projected a belief in technics as the means for achieving a \"perfect\" society in the near future. This technological utopia was not simply to culminate in the introduction of new tools and machines (which had, of course, been the ultimate didactic function of world's fairs); rather, it would be modeled on tools and machines - the 162 Just as one critic would, w hen considering Habitat, conclude that \"our increasingly affluent society will be demanding greater choice in... high -density housing\", Safdie assumed that his project, as \"prototype\", could only be achieved given the existing \"economy of abundance\". See: S pring, \"Is 67\" precasting plant, the prefabricated cell - in terms of institutions, values, and culture.163 Habitat could make credible such claims on the future in one important and novel aspect: it was built at full scale - whether as factory or \"vernacular\" community - and meant to be experienced \"live\". As such, the housing exhibit made a crucial departure from earlier modernist narratives on the future city designed for popular consumption: it was no longer in the tradition of promoting miniaturised landscapes of the future typical of architectural contributions to world's fairs.164 Unlike these \"perfected\" types, Habitat appeared as a work in progress. This sense of incompletion was always part of the spectacle. The image of vertiginously arranged cells, with one unit purposely left dangling from the crane, aimed to convince authorities of the project's viability - not necessarily of its forms, but of its methods. Safdie had, well before the opening of Expo 67, already moved \"On from Habitat\" and began positing a new \"system\" that, w hile still mass -produced, could offer 163 Howard Segal, Technological Utopianism in American Culture (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1985), 14ff. 164 David Nye, American Technological Sublime (Cambridge MA: The MIT Press, 1994), 215. Nye argues that corporations used world's fairs originally to exhibit products , after which they started to explain processes, and finally turned to creating \" simulated landscapes\" (\"miniaturised landscapes of the future\") - such as Norman Bel Geddes's Futurmama diorama of the \"City of 1960\" for the \"Highways and Horizons\" exhibit in the General Motors pavilion at the 1939 New York World's Fair - as a way of marketing the future. The corresponding part to F uturama was industrial designer Henry Dreyfuss's Democracity, a vision of the city in the year 2039. Both Futurama and Democracity were replete with skyscrapers. Another example appeared in Le Corbusier's presentation of his plans for Paris inside his Pavillon de Temps Nouveau erected at the 1937 Paris International Exposition. In describing his \"gratte -ciel cart\u00e9sian\", Le Corbusier reproduce d a page from Paris Soir (24 August 1938), which discussed the 1939 fair, Democracity, and the fact that the actual insalubrious skyscraper city of New York was simply a return to the Middle Ages. In his accompanying commentary, Le Corbusier remind ed that the skyscraper was, in fact, \"born in France (Salon d'automne 1922, Une Ville Contemporaine)\" - an earlier instan ce of promoting his ideas in expositions - and that, upon \"disembarking in New York in 1935, I told the American journalists: 'The skyscrapers are too small and there are too many of them...' It caused a scandal in the press.\" See: Le and P. (Zurich: Editions d'Architecture, 1995), by author. 404 \"produce a range of 'true' differentations\".165 Shown quite literally as toy -like building blocks, the idea was to promote - to any number of agencies now adopting systems building as an approach to urban design - mass production as capable of responding to the ever - changing needs of consumer society (fig. 6.21).166 This was not only to present a general theory on architecture but to situate future Habitat schemes as necessarily ready for adoption by governments. Safdie 's consequently drawings began to change. Unlike the exacting axonometrics of Habitat 67, new projects would carry a more \"open\" expression through ink sketches, with the entire process from fabrication to erection now actually showing people alongside machines and architecture. This was, above all, a way to domesticate \"systems\" in the popular imagination. Safdie had consciously cultivated a mediatic strategy of presenting three -dimensional combination of building materials as an image of architectural proliferation. 167 Moreover, he had, from the beginning, judiciously crafted a dramatic style of showing models in heroic isolation; indeed, architectural journals continued publishing 165 Safdie, \"On from Habitat\", 49. 166 Before the completion of Habitat 67, Safdie began to imagine abstract design methods, not unlike games, in which u sers were given means to create their own environment. He modeled a Habitat \"house\" as a fixed element within \"6 -module component system\": a cube would represent \"stability\" (\"to satisfy requirements of sunlight, distribution of services\", and so on) whil e \"five accessories\" could be \"selected by the tenants\" and \"placed to produce hundreds of different houses\" - \" the cross- shaped house, the circular house, the elliptical house, the oblong house, the crystal -shaped house, the L -shaped house, the hipped -roof house\" - \"that have truly different spatial character and are capable of adaptation and change by individuals\". See: Safdie, \"On from Habitat\", Design show ed the \"6 -module component system\" at the 1967 Aspen Design Conference, where he jointly presented with Christopher Alexander. See: Safdie and Alexander, \"Complete or Incomplete?\", 191- 196. Beringer, \"An Image of Habitat 67 in 1968: They Finished It, So It Was a Failure\", L'Image 2 (May 1996): 181. 405 photographs of models of new Habitat schemes daringly projected against l and or sky. Yet reports for governmental agencies consciously used the new drawn aesthetic to suggest the ease and ready availability of industrialised techniques that always shown just slightly above ground level, thereby offering a comfortable panorama of production while remaining technologically and ideologically persuasive. It was precisely how Safdie presented his Operation Breakthrough project to HUD (fig. 6.22). Everything could, it seemed, be made into a box. *** The dream awaited one final step . It remained whether Habitat 67 could reproduce itself outside Expo 67, outside the sanction of state -issued debt. \"As a building system\", Safdie had announced shortly before Expo 67 opened, \"Habitat 67 attempts to provide for the present growth of exis ting and new urban developments.\" 168 While trying to initiate Habitat schemes for Israel, New York, or Operation Breakthrough, Safdie received a commission to build low -cost housing for moderate- income families in Puerto Rico. Made of interlocking hexagona l units, the project was perhaps the closest approximation of what Safdie had wished to extrapolate from Montreal, distilling theories on \"close packing\" (still stemming from D'Arcy Thompson) but offering, he hoped, something more than the repetitive \"modu lar system\" of Habitat 67. 169 The project was again rendered as an almost 168 Mosh e Safdie, \"Habitat '67 - Towards the Development of a Building System\", Journal of the Prestressed Concrete Institute (Chicago, February 1967): 62. 169 Moshe Safdie, \"Variety within Repetition\" and \"Habitat Puerto Rico\", Architecture Canada (November 1969): 49, 51. 406 autonomous process of building and assembly. The sketches showed the entire \"system\" naturalised in the intermediate tec hnology of a potentially underdeveloped society (fig. 6.23). A prefabrication plant was set up and production commenced. Yet the government withdrew financial support and the developer stopped construction after only 30 modules were in place (fig. 6.24). It remain ed whether it was a shame or poetic justice that th e end of the Habitat experiment - with its ideas on Mediterranean vernaculars and Team 10 inspiration s of indigenous architectures, but finally realised in Northern climes - could only have been in the jungles of the New World. In Montreal, the North Clus ter would be completed in 1974 - then, nothing. Nothing emerged along Cite du Havre. Nothing else appeared in Montreal. Nothing further grew from government patronage. By 1970, CMHC had begun cutting public funds for hous ing in favour of privatisation. In the meantime, Canada continued to suburban ise. Standing apart, Habitat 67 remain ed a mute symbol of audacious - and unfulfilled - dreams for Montreal becoming a city of five million people by the year 2000. As the remaining Expo 67 structures slowly began decay ing on the invented worlds of the twin islands, residents inside the permanent concrete boxes could only stare silently across the river or at the distant city skyline, the poles between which Man in the City was once imagined to arise anew . 407 Conclusion: A Nation Expo 67 represents, in microcosm, the contrasting worlds of the biplane and the jet liner. Progressive Architecture (June 1967) There's a tidal wave of mysticism Surging through our jet -aged generation Said it's all designed to take us to the sky Funkadelic, \" Better By the Pound \" (1975) What, then, of the fair? In short span of six months, from April 27 to October 29, 1967, 50 million people came to see the \"world\" re -presented, re-organised, and re-mapped. In the realm of Terre d es hommes , nations were imagined subordinated to peoples, politics to kn owledge, ideologies to themes. With the final atomising of the master plan into national pavilions, the theme pavilions, many with noteworthy architecture, would serve to display the contents of global culture: Man the Creator, a museum of fine arts; Man in the Community on the urban realm ; Man the Provider, a remarkable display on agriculture; Man the Producer and Man the Explorer, which encompassed \"life\", the planets and space, and, of course, the polar regions; and Habitat 67. In a brilliant stroke of marketing, visitors were issued a \"passport\" to enter \"man and his world\" (fig. 7.1). As they moved among countries and corporations, a stamp was issued for every frontier crossed - a laissez -passer allowing a borderless vision of a world free from strife, inequity, and violence. Even as each pavilion sat on its plot, fairgoers could, when riding the Minirail looping high above, look down and, for an instant, believe that here lay th e new outlines of postwar society . Only the most perspicacious, or ironic, critics look ed down and note that the outline of Frei Otto's amazing tensile roof - \"it proved that his system was eminently adaptable to any shape of plan\" - suspended over the West 408 German pavilion actually resembled \"West and East Germany\", \"former areas now firmly within the domain of Poland\", and \"a hunk of Czechoslovakia, in the area of the S\u00fcdetenland\". 1 Elsewhere, the United States and Soviet Union (which, with 13 million visitors, would hold the attendance record), faced one another opposite a Cosmos Walk bridging the islands, replaying - now in terms of a \"space race\" - a previous generation's gigantism when the USSR and Germany had similarly engaged in a battle of style at the 1937 Paris Exposition Universelle (fig. 7.2). In the Canadian precinct, the largest of the fair, individual provincial pavilions found Quebec, housed in an elegant elevated glass box, floating separately in its own moat, unmistakably adjacent to Fran ce. Popular accounts inevitably read Expo 67 as a \"city\". Here were \"ideological and organisational links\" appearing simultaneously in Montreal's downtown core and the world's fair - \"links\" that J.M. Richards, the longstanding editor of The Architectural Review and champion of the modern movement, both appreciated and simply left behind when entering Expo 67, a space \"so different\" from that which he just left, \"free from the constricted narrow streets, from obsolescence, from machine- made noises and odou rs, from anonymity, and from the hard facts of daily life\". Free from the mechanisation of modern life, the turmoil of work, the psycho -social poverty of being a stranger, a trip to the islands was not, the Canadian Corporation for the World Exhibition (C CWE) insisted, an \"evasion\": leaving the real city behind, the visitor was brought \"face to face with Man and His Work and, he 1 Abraham Rogatnick, \"Expo 67, the Past Recaptured\", Lotus 5 (1968): 33. 409 himself, participated in the spectacle in which he took delight\" (fig. 7.3).2 Expo 67 stood, literally across the water, as foil to the existing city, offering a space in which the productive and creative efficacies of \"man\" could be re-presented in ideal forms, shorn as they were from the social relations that otherwise granted value to exchanges of everyday life. The idea was described by the Architectural Record (in a celebratory mood marking most accounts in professional magazines): \"Understandably, it confounds those who expect to see only quantitative boasts of industrial strength, military power, scientific progress, and cultural ascendance.\" 3 Still, there remained an inescapable fact: the nation -state. Ultimately every invitation by the Commissioner General Pierre Dupuy, the old hand diplomat brought out of retirement to run the fair, was issued to countries based on \"the recognition and of the self-assertion of each of the Nations in the field of individual pavilions.\" 4 \"Self -assertion\" simply meant architectural style, whether historicist or modernist. As Abraham Rogatnick, the Canadian corresponded to the Italian journ al Lotus , caustically noted, The whole question of symbolism as an element as an element in architecture of the late twentieth century architecture is one that may well bear investigation. Is it not strange that a whole generation of fairly near descendan ts - call them grandchildren - of Wright, of Le Corbusier, of Gropius and of Mies, are unabashedly boasting of their creations in terms of moral, political, and poetic symbols? That is: expressions of and representation of something other than their most obvious functions, their most dominating structural systems and most cogent materials. Obviously, there is something about World Fair psychology which elicits, perhaps demands, this curious comportment.... 2 Canadian Corporation for the World Exhibition, General Report on the 1967 World Exhibitio n Vol. 3 (1969), 1263. 3 \"A Brilliantly Ordered Visual World\", Architectural Record (July 1967). 4 General Report on the 1967 World Exhibitio n Vol. 3, 1268. 410 Is this what architecture is for? We have certainly come a long way from Dessau if serious architects can blatantly squeeze the shapes and details of their buildings into such banal ideograms. 5 The clear association of some modern style with the nation -state was understood as a closure to the modernist project. To press the point (when dismissing Basil Spence's self -consciously \"craggy\" British pavilion), Rogatnick recalled the Crystal Palace and insisted that while Queen Victoria's diaries described every object inside the ferro-vitreous behemoth as upholding the glory of Empire, Joseph Paxton only defended his design by \"its ease of erection and convenience as a container\". 6 Notwithstanding his muddy history, Rogatnick attempted to recuperate the ethics of some unadulterated functionalism from the aes thetics of political filiation. Yet the doctrinaire line could not accommodate a salient aspect of world's fairs: the desire of fairgoers necessarily to experience the construction of difference , to measure aspects of their own life world against those of others. At its most hopeful, this was to be revealed in the themes . At its most crude, it would be reduced to aesthetics. Had he known, Rogatnick could only have been grateful that Expo 67 never pursued Dupuy's first ambition: namely, a world's fair in which the \"civilised\" nations of the world - Britain, France, America, and Canada - would occupy their own compound. Still, for other architects and critics, there was, even amidst the efflorescence of \"'cellular' architecture\" and megastructural ambition, an exhaustion of a modern ambition to 5 Rogatnick, \"Expo 67, the Past Recaptured\", 33. Only three structures were spared Rogatnick's wrath: Buckminster Fuller's geodesic dome for the United States pavilion, Moshe Safdie's Habitat 67, and the transportation systems. 6 Ibid., 32. 411 resituate the \"world\" by architectural form. In Rogatnick's asymmetrical history, the nineteenth century, the modern , haunted the present. Like the van Ginkels, his reading likely took from Sigfried Giedion.7 The thesis was , of course, the transmission of cultural ideals from one epoch to the next. Giedion's act of recuperation had made nineteenth - century technology - and his construction of historical contexts (read: ideologies) around them - relevant to resituating present. Thus, for example, discourses on space frames. Yet the search for a genuinely new form of social organisation lay in another kind of technics, one that Giedion had suggested in his trope of \"interpenetration\" as the artistic and psychological expression of a collective modern consciousness. The idea of intermingling of spaces creating a new social reality had been evoked in \"lyrical\" parts of a \"New Monumentality\" animated not only by long -span structures but by the suggestion of filmic projections and the creation of truly immersive environments. The sensation of being deep inside, of being overcome, by some spatial event was crucial to Giedion's theory of modernity (and evident in his preference for the dematerialising effects of photograp hy). If this was still the haunting of a nineteenth -century visual imaginary - one that Giedion's interlocutor Walter Benjamin had so precisely defined in the ambit of the panoramas (and leading up to the expositions universelles ) - then it came , in fact, to be conjured again at Expo 67. 7 Rogatnick received his architecture degree from Harvard in 1953, when he would have encountered Giedion. He then immigrated to Canada and settled in Vancouver. 412 In the spirit reminiscent of a Hugo -ian \"this will kill that\", architects would eschew the architecture of Expo 67 in favour of something altogether different: films. Not just films but, in the parlance of the era, envir onments . Over three thousand films were produced for Expo 67; approximately 65 percent of the pavilions or complexes presented moving images, many of which were technical marvels extending the flexibility of the screen and mediums of projection to heroic proportions. 8 As much as these experimental works often required being housed in unique forms, they were immediately interpreted as architectures in themselves, often dwarfing their audiences and offering a sensory immersion that eclipsed even the most radical structures at the fair. While anticipating a future of \"'cellular' construction\", the CCWE had also argued: People are no longer awed by the latest model of widescreen cinema, colour television, the latest model of an electronic computer, or the fully automated plant. However, the public mind is still fascinated and may be enriched by seeing how the ever-widening range of techniques and discoveries serve Man to shape the world of tomorrow. In other words: Universal E xhibitions must not be a static showcase for the arts, the science of technology. At all costs, any temptation to show the latest \"hardware\" must be resisted. The major effort should be to concentrate on subjects and modes of presentation which are likely to stir the imagination. 9 Thus could Reyner Banham, arriving at Expo 67, becoming frustrated by the queues, and admitting disappointment in most of the architecture (especially Habitat 67), admit: 8 Janine Marchessault, \"Multi -Screens and Future Project at Expo 67\", in Janine Marchessault and Susan Lord, eds., Fluid Screens, Expanded Cinema (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2007), 29. 9 Canadian Corporation for the World Exhibition, The Theme Man and His World (Ottawa, 1965), 14. 413 If Expo 67 has laid some giant eggs, it also has some resounding successes to boast, and some partial successes for further study. For instance, audio -visual communication is an area of general success. And so it should be, since Expo is practically in the heart of McLuhan country. 10 Banham singled out two examples. On the one hand was the Czechoslovak pavilion offering multiple filmic environments including one allowing audience feedback to change the storyline: here the visitor became a \"participant - not as a simple dazed receptacle of respectful impressions\". 11 On the other hand was L abyrinth (or Labyrinthe ), an official theme pavilion designed as a hulking, seemingly impenetrable, concrete box inside which people moved through \"torturous passageways\" between three chambers: in t he first part, audiences stood o n eight balconies on four levels to watch a two-screen film projected along the floor and at the far end of the oval space; next, after \"the colorful film bombardment\", they moved into a \"maze\" of two -way mirrors through which they saw thousands of small lights; finally, entering the third space, a theatre arranged on three levels, they encountered In The Labyrinth , a ground -breaking film projected in a five -screen cruciform arrangement (fig. 7.4).12 Produced by the National Film Board of Canada and using footage shot on location t hroughout the world, the films, inspired by the Greek myth of Theseus and the Minotaur, offered a narrative on the \"inner struggle\" of \"man\" \"triumph over his 10 \"L'Homme \u00e0 l'Expo\", New Society (1 June 1967): 812. 11 Ibid. 12 Canadian Corporation for the World Exhibition Press Service, \"Labyrinth\", press release (no date): 1 -4, RG53, Vol. 3, National Film Board Fonds, Library and Archives Canada, Ottawa; National Film Board of Canada Technical Operations Branch, \"Labyrinthe\", Technical Bulletin Number 8 (March 1968): 1- 19. 414 hesitations\", thereby arriving at individual self -realisation.13 The aim was, for the filmmakers, to construct a \"ritual\" or \"artistic\" experience creating \"a state of mind\": \"While other theme pavilions represented man's conquest of his environment and his development as a provider, producer, healer, and community -oriented being, 'Labyrinthe' deal t with man's conquest of himself.\"14 The effect was stunning, with masses of people seemingly dwarfed by the endlessly changing images of ancient crafts and modern technologies (fig. 7.5) Banham hated it, dismissing the \"melodrama\" and \"bottomless sentime ntality of theme (if you have a low threshold of noble peasantry and black titties, avoid all the films at Expo, with exceptions I'll mention later).\"15 The criticism, typically though unfortunately phrased, followed perfectly Banham's technological determinism, which insisted on the invention of tools or machines allowing individuals somehow to control their environment s (and not be passive recipients of information) - hence his willful reading of Man the Producer in terms of Cedric Price's Fun Palace, or his delight in the role of human interaction at the Czechoslovakian pavilion. The refusal to engage Labyrinth left Banham outside other possibilities, noticed by many critics, of reimaging architectural space. The correspondent for The Architectural 13 Expo 67 Memorial Album (Thomas Nelson & Sons, 1968), 66. 14 Roman Kroitor, Colin Low, et al., quoted in Marchessault, \"Multi -Screens and Future Cinema: The Labyrinth Project at Expo 67\", 40- 41; National Film Board of Canada Technical Operations Branch, \"Labyrinthe\", Technical Bulletin Number 8 (March 1968): 3. As Marchessault notes, Low had previously created remarkable animated films on space travel. These had greatly impressed Stanley Kubrick, who invited Low to work on the design of 2001: A Space Odyssey . Despite meeting Kubrick several times, Low was finally too busy with Labyrinth, which took several years to make. 15 Banham, \"L'Homme \u00e0 l'Expo\", 811. 415 Review (Banham's erstwhile patron) discovered in the new kinds of \"total environment\" a welcome lack of architectural legibility: Labyrinth, however, not only had a theme of its own, but it has created a new space without even the use of film. Connecting its t wo display spaces (there isn't an existing word to describe them) is a series of meditation galleries. They have none of the recognisable hardware of spaces; no walls, no ceiling, no views; this is true software space, in which, without any physical chang e, the whole atmosphere can be made terrifying, exciting or contemplative. 16 Once confronted by \"software space\" it became \"impossible to be thrilled any more by the conventional space system.\" 17 In this vision of the technological sublime, the installatio n worked to highlight a new sense of simultaneity - between images, peoples, epochs - and a heightened experience of space-time; as such, synaesthetic experience could overcome human limitations and work to merge \"man\" with the \"world\" once again.18 If Banham had, like others, noted this was being done in \"McLuhan country\", then it was hardly surprising that Marshall McLuhan, no doubt influenced by Labyrinth, soon stated: Multi -screen projection tends to end the story -line, as the symbolist poem ends narra tive in verse. That is, multiple screens in creating simultaneous syntax eliminates the literary medium from film. 19 16 Jeremy Baker, \"Expo and the Future City\", The Architectural Review (August 1967): 154. As the journal noted, Baker was \"a young English architect temporarily resident in Montreal\". 17 Ibid. 18 David Nye, American Technological Sublime (Cambridge M A: The MIT Press, 1994), 60 -62; Marchessault, \"Multi -Screens and Future Cinema: The Labyrinth Project at Expo 67\", 32. While defining the \"technological sublime\" as an aspect of the imagination faltering before the immensity of machines (or their effects) , thus creating moments of social communion, Nye also historicises aspects of, say, a more transcendental technicism - for example, Emerson's sense that technology, as a form of art, could re -merge people and nature. 19 Marshall McLuhan, Counter Blast (1969), quoted Marchessault, \"Multi -Screens and Future Cinema: The Labyrinth Project at Expo 67\", 46. McLuhan first produced Counter Blast as a small booklet in 1954. The title consciously evoked Wyndham Lewis's futurist magazine Blast published in 1914 and 1915. McLuhan's layout borrowed from Lewis's radical juxtaposition of words on the page and meant to amplify their sonic qualities (much in the vein of Italian Futurism). 416 Banham judged Labyrinth as little better than a kind of National Geographic sentimentalism (if not voyeurism). Indeed, its somewhat lachrymose quality was not unlike The Family of Man, which had so influenced early concepts on Expo 67 and its theme. In attempting to establish homologies across any number of inequalities in the world, both In the Labyrinth and The Family of Man risked accus ations of fashioning a spectacular form of propaganda from banalities.20 In other words, the construction of some universal humanism was perhaps the withering of personal experience. Yet it was here, when trying to find a different sense of humanism, that the latent influence of Giedion's \"interpenetration\" on Expo 67 was revealed: a true rekindling of experience actually came via the creation of new artistic forms adequate to the material circumstances they confronted. 21 Giedion shared the belief with Walter Benjamin, who had read the nineteenth -century expositions as a neurasthenic dream world that simultaneously produced the technologies to be levelled against this very \"phantasmagoria\" or \"poverty of experience\" (\"Glass is, in general, the enemy of secr ets\"). 22 McLuhan's evocation of symbolist poetry (also Benjamin's preferred source to announce modernism) was to situate the \"multi-screen\" as eclipsing not just realism but any form of 20 Ben Highmore, \"Phantasmagoria at Expo 67\", in Rhona Richman Kenneally and Johanne Sloan, eds., Expo 67: Not Just a Souvenir (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2010), 133 -134. 21 Ibid., 130. 22 Walter Benjamin, \"Experience and Poverty\" (1933), in Selected Writings: 1927 -1934 (Cambridge MA: The Belknap Press of Harvard University, 19 99), 732, 734; Walter Benjamin, \"Paris, Capital of the Nineteenth Century\" (1935), in Reflections: Essays, Aphorisms, Autobiographical Writings (New York: Schocken Books, 1978), 146- 162. 417 unilateral discourse (the authority of the \"story -line\", thus of political language).23 Rather than serving industrial capitalism, In the Labyrinth , with its playful and bewitching power, offered technologies of vision to confront industrial propaganda (often seen elsewhere in equally immersive environments at Expo 67).24 This was its fullest global import: In the same way that the new spaces are multi- media, so they are multi-purpose. The fun life has merged into the education system, and it is perhaps the influence of Expo that the medium has suddenly developed along didac tic lines. To see Montrealers queuing up to learn about public health in Tehran at 9 o'clock on a Saturday night is to realize the potential of new methods. 25 The frankly populist appeal was what critics may have sensed missing in the architecture of Expo 67. If there was still to be some latent project of a \"new monumentality\" - a vision Giedion had, after all, partially constructed vis -\u00e0-vis his experiences of the 1937 Paris Exposition and the 1939 New York World's Fair - then it was to be discovered in the appearance of new forms of human association. (Banham had, of course, found this deep inside Man the Producer, its space frames producing a kind of \"open\" enivornment .) Just as Gyorgy Kepes's \"pattern seeing\" had offered architects a way to navigate the information 23 McLuhan was in contact with Giedion since the 1940s and embraced S pace, Time and Architecture and Mechanization Takes Command as influences. Their interlocutor was Jacqueline Tyrwhitt, who had worked closely with both Giedion in CIAM and McLuhan in the Exploration s group during the early 1950s (when she was teaching city planning at the University of Toronto) . Tyrwhitt had encouraged Blanche Lemco van Ginkel to establish GAI, a CIAM chapter based in Philadelphia (where they were teaching at the University of Pennsylvania ). See: Michael Darroch, \"Bridging Urban and and the Explorations Group 1951- 1957\", Canadian of Communication Vol. 2 (2008): 147- 169; Stephen Kowal, eds., Cartographies the Urban (Montreal Press, 2014), 77-91; 122. 24 Highmore, \"Phantasmagoria at Expo 67\", 133. 25 Baker, \"Expo and the Future City\", 154. 418 overload of the postwar world, so Labyrinth provided images - many of them - as templates for outlining shared values across cultures, thus outside the limits - quite literally the lot lines - of the many nations defining the Expo 67 master plan. Still, if Labyrinth was, as McLuhan and others suggested, a place to recuperate a newfound sense of humanism appropriate to the late twentieth century , then it only remained whether or not celebrating the nation -state, which occupied so much space at the fair, really mattered. *** What, then, of the world? Banham's optimistic construction of a ludic environment inside Man the Producer was also a critique of Buckminster Fuller's geodesic dome for the United States pavilion. The remarkable structure - a five -eighth dome, 200 feet tall and 250 feet wide, made of outer triangulated steel web (carrying the heavy loads) joined to interior c hords arranged in a hexagonal grid support ing both an acr ylic skin and motorised fan -shaped blinds opening and closing according to solar gain - was, at least for architects, the most celebrated structure at the fair (fig. 7.6). It was also the most outwardly \"global\" - not only in appearance, a new kind \" colis\u00e9e de fer \" (recuperating the nineteenth-century exposition s), but given its changing participation in negotiating the cultural terrain of cold war geopolitics. Fuller's dome was commissioned by the United States Information Agency (USIA) as proof of \"American Creativity\". 26 The idea had animated Fuller's previous contributions to USIA exhibitions - the United States pavilion at the 1956 Jeshyn International Fair in Kabul and the 1959 26 \"Bucky's Biggest Bubble\", Architectural Forum (June 1966): 75. 419 American National Exhibition in Moscow (site of the famous \"kitchen debate\" between Nikita Khrushchev and Richard Nixon), to say no thing of the Radomes establishing the Distant Early Warning line across the Canadian Arctic. As the magazine Architectural Forum insisted when anticipating Fuller's work at Expo 67, the exhibition domes \"almost invariably filled foreign spectators with awe at U.S. technical virtuosity, and with delight at U.S. esthetic sensibility.\" 27 As much as this was to be a triumph of the arts over ideology, something also presumably to be achieved at Man and His World, Fuller saw both fields perfectly aligned in geodesics, with the lightweight structure s - the Kabul project reused many times elsewhere, the Radomes ferried by military transport - demarcating a new global network of influence. 28 Indeed, geodesics stood for Fuller as shifting the use of scientific and technological discoveries away from destructive ends and to peaceful purposes.29 Moreover, the quite literal redrawing of a geodesic globe at Expo 67 drew on Fuller's Dymaxion Map, first presented in 1943, which sought to correct Mercator projection in the face of \"blitzkrieg\" or new means of air travel (especially over the Arctic). In terms of politics, the emphasis on moving mat\u00e9riel fulfilled Fuller's obsession with countering global resource scarcity. (The idea had haunted him since the 1920s, when he began formulating the goal of 27 Ibid. 28 Jeffrey Lindsay, Fuller's Canadian acolyte and designer of the Man the Producer space frame, had in fact develo ped an \"arctic weatherbreak\" that \"could also be flown into other inaccessible areas, and erected very fast.\" The project was designed in 1951, five years before Fuller's Radome. While Fuller erected a prototype at the Pentagon, the real test was only po ssible in Canada given the ongoing postwar rationing of aluminium in the United States. See: \"Geodesic Dome\", Architectural Forum (August 1951): 147, 150 . 29 Buckminster Fuller, \"No More Second Hand God\", North Carolina State College Student Publication of the School of Design (Winter 19 54): 41- 47; Douglas Haskell, 198-200. 420 rationalising American society through industrial design.30). The result, a triangulated unfolding of the globe meant to minimise the distortion of land masses, contributed to Fuller's studies on the close packing of spheres t hat allowed visualising spheres as a series of faceted planes thus their approximation in geodesic shapes. Fuller's pavilion was a success. Architects and visitors alike were seduced by the feeling of almost floating inside a glazed realm \"modulated by the skin to provide\", Fuller proclaimed, \"a 'Garden of Eden'\". 31 Among the most popular pavilions at the fair, the dome and its exhibitions (created by the Cambridge Seven group) charmed visitors by the informality of organisation and brilliance of installa tion. As people ascended a 125 -foot long escalator or, in the only moment of its kind at Expo 67, actually rode the Minirail through the pavilion, there appeared a panorama of space capsules, fifty -foot high Pop Art paintings, and giant photographs of Hollywood stars, everything somehow defying gravity in a structure that quite literally seemed to be lighter than air (fig. 7.7). 32 The overall impression 30 Jonathan Massey, \"Buckminster Fuller's Cybernetic Pastoral: the United States Pavilion at Expo 67\", The Journal of Architecture Vol. 11, No. 4 (2006): 468 -469. 31 \"Bucky's Biggest Bubble\", 77. 32 In terms of public perception, Architectural Forum magazine had, when praising \"Bucky's Biggest Bubble\" in 1966, warned \"that next year, in Montreal, 'Creative America' will be on view befo re an international audience that knows a great deal about where the action is in in U.S. art, design, science and technology. To trot out mediocrity before such people would be an insult.\" See: \"Bucky's Biggest Bubble\", Architectural Forum (June 1966): 78. In fact, the USIA recognised that it was in the unprecedented situation of having to contend with Americans viewing their culture on foreign soil. Indeed, federal law prohibited the USIA from influencing American public opinion. (Curiously, an early USIA study included feedback on not pandering to what was purportedly a \"sense of low self -esteem\" on the part of Canadians vis-\u00e0- vis the United States. See: Jack Masey and Conway Lloyd Morgan, Cold War Confrontations: US Exhibitions and Their Role in th e Cultural Cold War (Baden, Switzerland: Lars M\u00fcller Publishers, 2008) , 36-57.

To architects celebrating the rise of immersive environments like Labyrinth, t he geodesic sphere was among the few architectural works actually capturing new possibilities of space -time. Rogatnick, who otherwise dismissed almost all the buildings at Expo 67, was fulsome in praise: The total result was a marvellously \"inefficient\" climate -conditioning system which should have raised the hair on the back of any self -respecting mechanical engineer, but which created an invigorating sense of airiness and freshness, light and shadow, warmth and coolness, all as much a part of the archit ectural experience as the lofty spaces, the physical movement and the views of the elegant structure silhouetted against the sky and earth. 33 Banham was, however, circumspect. Alone among leading critics, he would, while admiring its technics, find Fuller's dome wanting, especially in comparison to visiting Man the Producer, where he had happily wandered unencumbered by displays or artefacts. There was something more: But, chiefly, it is not Bucky Fuller's original project. This was for a giant flat spac e- frame on legs, sheltering a public gallery with control panels on which visitors could set up coast -to-coast strategic games, population movements, natural resources, ethnic distributions, conservation programmes, on an enormous map of the US that covere d the whole floor of the pavilion. That's the sort of level great exhibitions ought to be working at nowadays. 34 Fuller's first proposal had been to enact his recently designed World Game in which fairgoers were to generate strategies for improving the li ving conditions of all peoples. It was not, as Banham believed, to be played on a projection of the United States but with an interactive Dymaxion map. Sitting around the perimeter of a massive structure composed of Fuller's 33 Rogatni ck, \"Expo 67, the l'Expo\", 813. 422 octet trusses and elevated ab ove the map, here a dynamic display listing inventories of world resources, visitors would use computers to reorganise global data for creating \"win -win\" scenarios while transforming themselves into \"world citizens\" (fig. 7.8).35 The aim was, Fuller noted, to confront \"Drop Dead\" scenarios of war gaming with \"schemes of 'How to Make the World Work'\".36 Rejected by the USIA, not least given the sensitivity of an increasingly violent war in Vietnam, the World Game stood as a remarkable alternative to Terre de s hommes . To the initiated few, it must surely have recalled an original architectural speculation on a world organised by ever -changing \"storylines\". To others, though not to Banham, the phenomenal aspects of World Game -like environments had partially appeared in spaces like Labyrinth and the technological sublime that expressed greater global, even interplanetary, senses of scale overshadowing nation -state boundaries. The feeling, first encoded in the borrowings from Saint -Exup\u00e9ry's narratives on aviat ion, had become only more intensified since 1963 with increasingly distant views of the Earth from outer space. The Archimedean point where \"man the producer\" could actually move the planet was, therefore, also believed found, as one of the Labyrinth prod ucers put it, in \"the basic human need for a communal experience of vision\". 37 On the one hand was the utopian wish for 35 \"Fuller's Initial Concept for the U.S. Pavilion at Expo 67\", Domus (July 1968): 3. 36 Buckminster Fuller, \"How It Came About\" (1969), in Joachim Krausse and Claude Lichtenstein, eds., Your Private Sky: R. Buckminster Fuller, The Art of Design Science (Baden, Switzerland: Lars M\u00fcller Publishers, 1999) , 479. 37 Roman Kroitor, quoted in Gene Youngblood, Expanded Cinema (New York: E.P. Dutton & Co., Inc., 1970) , 352. Youngblood was instrumental to initiating Fuller's first World Game seminars. Fuller wrote the the introduction to Expanded Cinema , a theory he favourably described as \"the forward, omni -humanity educating function of man's total communication system.\" 423 some aesthetico -spatial experience visible to and shared among different people. On the other hand was a similarly hopeful vision of global fraternity but marked by a technocratic view on managing peoples and things (thus without differences or hierarchies), producing a kind of sovereignty also being advanced (though to different ends) by a war machine.38 The supposedly liberative act of redistribution had already been spatialised elsewhere in concepts like \"strategic hamlets\", which, as early exercises in managing the growing conflict in Vietnam, were part and parcel of the systems theory otherwise undergirding Fuller's millenarian desire s. While at a passing glance the United States pavilion fulfilled the CCWE's earliest hopes on \"'cellular' construction\", this was largely a matter of form. It did little to fulfill the suggestion of \"cellular\" technics as expressing some greater social meaning - a link was perhaps most evident at Habitat 67 given its useful value as housing. Still, these very different works were seen as somehow complementary. Progressive Architecture thus group ed a host of tendencies under \"Man and His Space Frame\", bringing together almost anything that appeared to be made by some form of serialised construction. The architectures were surely remarkable. Yet the compilation of what were, after all, temporary buildings only suggested a fashion for megastructures without some greater social purpose. A more political sense of \"cluster\" did, in fact, appear at Expo 67. The aesthetics and technics of grouped architectural forms could, so the theory went, offer different kinds of human association (beyond the rationality of Cartesian, or modernist, space-making). The 38 Felicity Scott , Architecture or Techno -Utopia (Cambridge MA: The MIT Press, 2007), 204. 424 most radical reading o f \"'cellular' construction\" (at the world's fair) assumed the rise of a very different popular expression of sovereignty - not simply as a nation -state but extending beyond it. Thus, Africa Place: here, under a series of red brick groupings topped by elegantly shaped white and yellow triangulated roofs , fifteen newly decolonised countries were grouped together to present, as the Expo 67 Memorial Album would put it, \"one of the most distinctive developments since Expo 58 in Brussels: the emancipation of black African countries (fig. 7.9).\"39 Designed by the Canadian architect John Andrews, who had completed the celebrated Scarborough College megastructure outside Toronto in 1965, the pavilion allowed, or so the CCWE claimed, \"for the first time, emerging African nations [to] reveal cultures, industries and plans of production\" - read: modernisation - \"to the world at large\".40 Cameroon, Chad , the Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, Ghana , Ivory Coast, Kenya, Madagascar, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, Togo, and Uganda showcased histories that had, on the one hand, been overshadowed by colonialism and were, on the other hand, being invented since emancipation.41 Indeed, the 1958 Brussels fair had taken the theme \"A New Humanism\" to project not only the peaceful use of atomic energy but, perversely, the ongoing cause of colonialism in the Belgian Congo. Now, the former British and French colonies were seen fulfilling what the van Ginkels and their architect allies 39 Expo 67 Memorial Album , 220. 40 \"Africa Place\" (no date), Series R869 -0-8- E, Canadian Corporation for the 1967 World Exhibition fonds, Library and Archives Canada, Ottawa. 41 Amon g other recently decolonised countries, Algeria also built a pavilion. African representation was elsewhere witnessed in the Ethiopian pavilion, a colourful cone -shaped interpretation of the ceremonial umbrellas carried by priests in the ancient city of A xum. 425 had, in late 1962, hoped would be the influence of \"smaller countries\" benefitting from \"cooperative participation\" on the fair itself.42 The van Ginkels and others made the issue of decolonisation paramount - it represented a remapping different from the bi-polar world they wished to confront. Yet in the apparently uneven development of West and East, of the colonising and colonised, the appearance of the African nations served simultaneously to stabilise and to undermi ne the very global networks imagined arising in Terre des Hommes . The early embrace of themes such as Man and the Polar Regions elevated technology and scientific discovery as a principle of cultural development, thus of modernity. Decolonisation, too, meant the instrumentalisation of technology: as much as the van Ginkels and their architect allies suggested that new nations would best uphold the ideal of grouped pavilions, they were quick to note that Ghana could, as a newly independent country, represe nt itself by its mineral resources. 43 Well before Man and His World, things like the \"green revolution\" were specifically championed as means for individual nations (here developing ones) to showcase their best work. 44 These aspects of modernisation - with origins in postwar 42 R. Affleck, Michel A21-13, Fonds van Ginkel, Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal. 43 Daniel van Ginkel, H. Mayerovitch, et al., \"Le Th\u00e8me\" (Congr\u00e8s -1990- for Architecture, Montreal . 44 Henry E. Strub, \"World Fair - Montreal - 1967\" (26 October 1962): 3, 27-A21-13, Fonds van Ginkel, Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal . 426 Western techno-science - were precisely the things once imagined as quite literally building the \"plug -in\" scenarios of the theme pavilions. In a sense, the van Ginkels and others had read decolonisation, whether in Africa or elsewhere, as a way to uphold, really to invent, an ideal of Canada. This was to see Canada in similar terms, as a young, modern nation, free of colonial (British) or geopolitical (American) constraints. Yet the discourse was somehow exhausted. The appearance of decolonised nations was described in terms of historical development - of nations arriving at finished states of modernisation - that were being eclipsed by cycles of a late capitalism in which notions on the core and periphery were extended in a new \"w orld system\" obviating distinctions between \"first\" and \"third\" worlds in favour of other forms of accumulating global capital. This included cultural capital, with the identification of \"new directions\" in architecture arising throughout the African cont inent. 45 At Expo 67, the full commodification of things became apparent in the final application of \"'cellular' construction\" to those very cultures from which these aesthetics had once been extracted. *** What, finally, of Canada? Like other nations faci ng their empty plots on the Expo 67 master plan, Canada confronted a crisis of representation. How exactly would it show itself - as host - to the world? If this was a question of aesthetics - a concern over appropriate symbolism for a country that had e nthusiastically adopted modern architecture only in the past two decades - 45 Udo Kultermann, New Directions in African Architecture (New York: George Braziller, Inc., 1969). 427 then for the van Ginkels and the Montebello conference this was always meant to be resolved in the sphere of theme . Canada could resituate world's fairs through things like Man and the Polar Regions, which offered a space - hemispheres or environments as opposed to nation - states; exploration as a transcendent human concern - where other countries could discover common purpose. T echno -science, was, again, an ascendant concern . When first endowed with the properties of Terre des Hommes , Expo 67 was imagined fulfilling Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's meditation on \" la ligne \", \"the craft\", as a technological mediation of the world revealing a common sense of purpose across cultures. Owing in the firs t instance quite literally to the piloting of a machine, the French aviator -philosopher's rumination on a resulting omniscient view of the earth was extended, at the Montebello deliberations and in the van Ginkels' plans, to encompass exploration as an ult imate means of progressively binding peoples and technics: Terre des Hommes - Man and His World - would be a record, an inventory of man in all his moods, extolling his accomplishments, examining his hopes and fears. To gain self -awareness, man explores h is world, adapts to it, and cultivates it. As his knowledge grows, he acquires new means to modify his environment, and his behaviour subsequently changes in the context of a world in evolution. Throughout this continuing process, man reorganizes his diverse relationships with the world, history, time and place. 46 Explore, adapt, cultivate : ever -increasing senses of \"self -awareness\" were coded in Man and the Polar Regions, the thematic and architectural source of Expo 67, via \"storylines\" meant 46 \"How EXPO 67 Got Its Theme\", The News and Eastern Townships Advocate ( April 27, 1967): 8. The Report of the Montebello Conference was here excerpted in a regional Quebec newspaper covering the first days of Expo 67. 428 continuous ly to arrange world cultures by shared beliefs in modernisation. This was, above all, to shape an ecumenical view on progress. This fit the deliberate construction of a newly modernising sense of Canadian identity. Arctic development - \"roads to resour ces\" leading to \"a Canada of the North\" - had been promoted by a Progressive Conservative government in a spirit of Tory Futurism , a renovating style of power, at once restorative and modernising, advancing a utopian technicism to be enjoyed by sovereign c onsumers.47 The veneration of technology (and the rise of a technocratic class) was presumed essential to social modernisation - a schema erring on one side of the British chemist and novelist C.P. Snow's influential argument on \"two cultures\" that found, in the mid -1950s, a traditional literary mindset yielding to \"the frontier qualities\" of scientists shaping \"a directing class of a new society\". 48 Extended in Canadian 47 David Mellor, \"A 'Glorious Techniculture' in Nineteen -Fifties Britain: The Many Cultural Contexts of the Independent Group\", in David Robbins, ed., The Independent Group: Postwar Britain and the Aesthetics of Plenty (Cambridge MA: The MIT Press, 1990), 229. Mellor defines Tory Futurism in relation to British society marked by technological advance, social modernisation, and consumer demand in the mid -1950s: \"That the styles of political power might masquerade as archaic is unarguably the case, since they were as ambivalent as that meeting of the monarchic, adventuring past and the nuclear, space -exploring future which was the essential component of the New Elizabethan mythology.\" The Roads to Resources programme was initiated by the Progressive Conservative government of Prime Minister John Diefenbaker. It aimed at providing transportation infrastructure to re mote parts of Canada for facilitating access to natural resources. It was also an announcement on Canadian nationalism. First promoting his vision in 1958, Diefenbaker declared: As far as the Arctic is concerned, how many of you here knew the pioneers in Western Canada. I saw the early days here. Here in Winnipeg in 1903, when the vast movement was taking place into the Western plains, they had imagination. There is a new imagination now. The Arctic. We intend to carry out the legislative prog ramme of Arctic research, to develop Arctic routes, to develop those vast hidden resources the last few years have revealed. Plans to improve the St Lawrence and the Hudson Bay route. Plans to increase self -government in the Yukon and Northwest Territories. W e can see one or two provinces there.

Snow, s\", New Statesman (6 October 1956): 413 . The \" greatest enrichment the scientific culture could give us is - thought it does not originate like that - a moral one\", Snow conclude d, 429 discourses on industrial modernisation, the scientific outlook also extended to architects working for the s tate and charged with projecting utterly remarkable (but finally unrealised) megastructures in the far north. These works were means to settle - really to compensate for - a seemingly inhospitable environment that underpinned longstan ding and newly resurrected historical narratives, projected by southern Canadians, of being a nation of pioneers (fig. 3.9).49 By exposing the hinterland, techno-science (and its imagery) served to propel the Conservative paradigm of the basic rootedness of culture. When considered beyond the dictates of narrow national interest, this ethos, which also coloured initial ideas on the world's fair, reflected just how Man and the Polar Regions was imagined in the terms of the first UNESCO Director General Julian Huxley's \"transhumanism\", an inspiration for the Expo 67 theme, and its emergence in his preferred example of the Tennessee Valley Authority, where political problems were to be transformed into technological solutions. ( It was perhaps helpful that the nationalisation of hydroelectricity in Quebec appeared as backdro p to the van Ginkels' plans .) While this husbandry of cultures and landscapes - the sense of contemporary world history as a series of feedback loops reinforcing links between the arts, technology, and society inside a theme pavilion - was an appeal to pluralism, since scientists \"have nothing but contempt for those representatives of th e traditional culture who use a deep insight into man's fate to obscure the social truth - or to do something prettier than obscure the truth, just to hang on to a few perks.\" While otherwise noting the scientists were as equally divided between conservat ive and left -leaning politics as other educated members of society, Snow , who had been both a researcher and a high-level civil servant, saw the scientific mind as safeguarding against political injustice. He expanded his essay in the popular and influent ial book The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution of 1959. 49 Andrew Waldron, \"Frobisher Bay Future: Megastructure in Ideas Vol. VIII (2009): 20- 35. The sense of nation -building and territorial sovereignty would find architects, working for or under contract with the Department of Public Works, projecting permanent civilian settlements in the Arctic; the first designs immediately followed the Progressive Conservative electoral victory in 1957. 430 experienced not only in a world's fair as popular spectacle but via a theme meant to assuage anxieties over a division between humanistic and scientific knowledge, it really reflect ed a mindset of \"systems\" thinking in which a host of behavioural , computational, or psychological paradigms, all tinged by cybernetic discourse, were to sharpen \"expertise\" on collecting and processing ever -increasing amounts of data toward practical, lon g-term solutions on managing environments. (Snow had, in fact, adduced: \"Psycho- analysis once looked like a deep invasion, but that was a false alarm; cybernetics may turn out to be the real thing, driving down into the problems of will and cause and moti ve.\" 50) Man the Producer and Habitat 67 had been construed in this discourse; the influence of Kepes's \"pattern seeing\" on the van Ginkels' plans was symptomatic. For architecture (as a discipline) it meant placing emphasis on controlling complex systems as opposed to necessarily privileging intuitive aesthetic judgement - a line delineating early concerns, outlined by the van Ginkels' confrere Michel Chevalier, on the Expo 67 theme: A more complex approach [to theme development] is now being investigated. It was pioneered in 1952, when a number of leading Americans were queried on a question equally nebulous as the \"Terre des Hommes\" thematic treatment as so far developed. This question was \"How big should our (U.S) deterrent force be?\" The method consi sted of an initial series of questions which, through a rigorous system of analysis and feedback established areas of agreement and dissent, eliminated bias, and then arrived at a broad consensus of agreement. The general form of the \"answer\" to the quest ion has, it appears, served as a basis of American policy in this area for the past ten years. The process was completed in a manner of weeks. 51 50 Snow, \"The Two Cultures\", 414. 51 Michel Chevalier, \"Thematic Development, Position Papers No. 8\" (Tuesday, 23 July, 1963): 1- 2, Series A21-04, Fonds van Ginkel, Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal. 431 The unnamed 1952 questionnaire was characteristic of countless studies on ensuring survival of people and indu stry - writ large in the designed decentralisation of cities - under the cloud of \"megadeath\", a term popularised by the RAND Corporation military strategist Herman Kahn in his influential book On Thermonuclear War of 1960.52 Extrapolating from the otherwi se doomsday scenarios of war gaming, Chevalier indicated how systems theory was seen as guiding the arts and culture - with both artistic content and public perception adjudicated by experts (here, architects) - toward shaping welcome senses of \"consensus\" . The very spaces and technologies conjured by Man and the Polar Regions brought the 1952 study to its endpoint in the rise of a \"military -industrial complex\" (extended in the joint Canadian and American militarisation of the Arctic). At the same time, Chevalier's schematisation allowed the humanistic and technological spirit of, say, exploration to deliver a very different cultural -industrial complex in a world's fair imagined as communicating an enormous theme - at times described as almost the total ou tput of humanity - to a mass but heterogeneous audience. Such an undertaking as an extension of state capitalism was necessarily prey to the dismissive charge of fashioning a \"culture industry\" and its attendant \"technical contrast between the few product ion centers and the large number of widely dispersed consumption points\". 53 Here, complaints were made against a widespread 52 Peter Galison, \"War against the Center\", Grey Room 4 (Summer 2001): 26-28. Galison notes that urban decentralisation, as an aspect of civic defence applied to city planning, also influenced Canadian policy by the mid-1950s. Kahn's book was most famously parodied in Stanley Kubrick's 1964 film Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb . 53 Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno, Dialectic Adorno's coinage of \"culture 432 scientism, seen in systems, in which human needs were no longer central to technocratic governments; as W.L. Morton, the influential conservative historian responsible for the Canadian Centenary Series (a multivolume volume authoritative history of Canada be gun in 1963 as a contribution to the Centennial), observed when commenting on state of universities in the mid -1960s, \"only an Englishman such as Sir Charles Snow could speak of the existence of two cultures. To a North American there is only one, the sci entific.\"54 Yet it was specifically in fostering a new polity of anti-elitism and pluralism - thus to ensure \"agreement\" in Chevalier's terms - that the state could counter its incipient technicism in the 1960s; as a leading group of Canadian intellectuals declared, only the high arts and mass culture were capable of alleviating the \"manufacture of dull uniformity\" arising from a misguided faith of modern technology. 55 The statement, made by the Canadian Conference of the Arts following its important Semina r '65 convened to advise the government on both the Centennial celebrations and Expo 67, was not anti-technological. Updating landmark recommendations on state support for the arts made in the early 1950s, Seminar '65 concluded: \"Until recently the arts in Canada were unable to assume their rightful place. The new technology of communications offers the means for a national expression but only industry\" rest ed on a trenchant critique of mass media that they saw as manipulating society into passivity, thus hallmark of totalitarian regimes. 54 W.L. Morton \"The University as It Is and Is Becoming (1966), quoted in L.B. Kuffert, A Great Duty: Canadian Responses t o Modern Life and Mass Culture, 1939 -1967 (Montreal and Kingston, Ontario: McGill- Queens University Press, 2003), 133. Morton's remarks appeared during a period of creating new universities (many with distinctly megastructural architectures) throughout Canada - a situation in which the welfare state was viewed as mediating the status of humanistic versus scientific (even vocational) education. 55 Canadian Conference of the Arts, Seminar '65 -'67: Report (Montreal and Toronto, 1967) . 433 the arts can provide the significant content by which a nation comes to know itself\".56 Tinged by McLuhan rhetori c, the view was of an artistic base and a mediatic superstructure united in technologies of mass communication - whether television or Labyrinth - that could, via a new publicly supported cultural sector, compensate for a traditional economic reliance on n atural resources (now presumed inadequate to the demands of total social modernisation).57 Perhaps in mild riposte to the expert committees tasked with defining the Expo 67 themes, the Seminar '65 delegates (some of whom had been at Montebello) insisted that \"artists do more than enhance our lives. Like scientists, they illuminate and enrich it\". 58 This had epochal significance: \"1967, as well as marking a century of building Confederation, may well prove to be the year of its true completion; true in the sense that the modern forces of technology impel us toward a unity, and at least make it possible to share in a common heritage and a common destiny as we could never before.\" 59 An announcement on overcoming provincial and colonial mindsets of the past, and perhaps on countering Snow's warning of the specialisation of knowledge, the consequent lessening of outward nation -state symbols was to be compensated by the elevation of artists and scientists - along with their artefacts - as guiding popular senses of postwar modernity. 56 Ibid. 57 David Howar d \"The Transparent Empire?: Exhibition Strategy and the Cold War at Expo 67\", American, British and Canadian Studies Vol. 5 (December 2004): http://abcjournal.ulbsibiu.ro/David%20Howard.html. 58 Canadian Conference of the Arts, Seminar '65 -'67: Report . 59 Canadian Confederation on the Arts, Supplementary Brief to the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism (1965), quoted in Howard, \"The Transparent Empire?: Exhibition Strate gy and the Cold War at Expo 67\". 434 While the arts and sciences were to inform questions on Canadian nationhood in the 1960s, their conjunction in discourses like systems was, when writ large at a world's fair, to confront greater geopolitical narratives. In their ecumenical reach, the van Ginkels and their allies, who always understood the world's fair as rooted first and foremost in architecture as a social \"good\", unfailingly embraced technology as a liberating force in modern life. Indeed, their 1959 proposal for a C entral Mortgage and Housing Corporation design exhibition (a critical source of their considerations on Expo 67) had offered a prose poem on Canadian identity turning on the repeated refrain \"Mechanization took command\" - the borrowing from Sigfried Giedion's Mechanization Takes Command of 1948 suggested a series of historical plateaus stepping from one to the next by technological advance. Thus the van Ginkels' repeated reference to undertakings like the International Geophysical Year (IGY), which had att empted to bridge Cold War divisions by promoting scientific exchange between East and West, was not only to advance techno-science as a pacific force but to project Canada as an agent of similarly new global realignments. The hallmark IGY initiative of mu ltinational expeditions to Antarctica - resulting in the 1961 Antarctic Treaty declaring the continent a scientific and non -military preserve - led to ideas on exploration as theme in the diagrams of Man and the Polar Regions, the first statement on what properly became the megastructures of Man the Producer and Man the Explorer. The architects had imagined Man and the Polar Regions as uniquely suited to showcasing Canada by its geography and history: as other nations began, via architecture, to join \"stor ylines\" undergirding the pavilion, Canada would be seen in terms of new global alignments guided 435 by the apparatus of scientific research. On the one hand, this was a reinterpretation of Canada as a \"middle power\", the influential description used by the diplomat and future Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson when stressing autonomy - \"national in formulation and execution, but... never be isolationist or exclusive\" - in international affairs. 60 As much as the sentiment drew on Pearson's mediation of the Suez Cr isis, thus earning him a Nobel Peace Prize along with the opprobrium of London and Washington, there remained other Cold War realities and realignments including Canadian leadership in NATO.61 There was, too, the inescapable feeling of being overwhelmed by a superpower neighbour (notwithstanding being a junior partner in North American air defence) that guided a Canadian preference for multilateral relations as opposed to bilateral ones. 62 On the other hand, a \"middle\" cultural space, to be discovered in links between science and architecture (with the Arctic as theme), was witnessed in the admired combination of UNESCO's constituent parts, with the spirit of Huxley's \"transhumanism\" also believed found in both state and corporate capitalism creating, via technological advance, a pragmatic vision of liberal society. Indeed, the Montebello Conference's exhortation to oppose nations and 60 Lester B. Pearson, Address to meeting of Men' s and Women's Canadian Clubs, Halifax (April 5, 1957), in J.M. Bliss, ed., Canadian History in Documents, 1763 -1966 (Toronto: The Ryerson Press, 1966), 326 . 61 The cultural tie to NATO was reinforced by significant European e migration to Canada in the 1950s . 62 Robert Bothwell, Big Chill: Canada and the Cold War (Toronto: Canadian Institute of International Affairs, 1998) , 55-56. Canada maintained a certain distance from the United States on waging a global anti - communism crusade. To American disp leasure, Canada did not join the Vietnam War. Moreover, given an ongoing trade deficit with the United States (Canada's largest trading partner), Canadian economic policy was partly guided by opening markets abroad, including c ommunist countries, by the l ate 1950s. The trade deficit was offset by a large inflow of American investment capita l to Canada. T he Quebec Revolution tranquille had, by the early 1960s, witnessed the nationa lisation of industries, including hydroelectricity, often in the hands of American companies. 436 corporations was only a call to resist consumerism and corporatism (which the van Ginkels predicted would mar the 1964 New York world's fair), not techno-science. The nexus of culture, science, industry, nationhood, and architecture - as informing a world exhibition along with the host nation's role - had, in fact, an origin in American cold war political theory. Despite being swiftly celebrated as an exclusively indigenous undertaking - that is, construed solely by national expertise - the Montebello conference was, in fact, guided by a specific \"think tank\" approach to shaping postwar culture and geopolitics developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Soon after the PQAA retreat and well before Montebello, the CCWE contacted John Ely Burchard, the eminent MIT architectural historian, and solicit ed his advice on the world's fair. Burchard's reply was swift and enthusiastic. In a detailed memorandum, he suggested considering new ways of organising thematic, international, national, trade, and entertainment zones but insisted that the abiding concern rested in achieving a \"sense of place\" as opposed to any arbitrarily chosen symbol. 63 Commending the Quebec architects' \"proposal for a unified treatment dedicated to the study of the important problems of 'one world'\", Burchard nevertheless warned: \"Though the prospect of separatism in the world is gloomy, so is the prospect of over -unification.\" A prescient remark on the paroxysmal debates soon engulfing the master plan, it followed Burchard's steadfast belief that modern architecture - a true expression of the endurance of Western society and beliefs after tragi c encounters with 63 John E. Burchard, \"Memorandum of Suggestions Concerning Terre des Hommes Exhibition Montreal, 1967\" (no date): 1 -8, Fonds van Ginkel, Box. 3.02, Folder 27 -A21-10, Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal. 437 Fascism and now Communism - faced the postwar consequences of responding to \"humanity , our client \" as opposed to any \"doctrine of individualism\" (or beyond any narrow functionalism) .64 In other words, architecture could restore culturally specific but universally respected values to society . This was to be the full summoning of the arts at the world's fair. As such, Burchard critically proposed establishing a committee of intellectuals dedicated to fashioning a theme. The recommendation led directly to the convening of Montebello. 65 Burchard's suggestions were distributed to the conferees. For some - namely the van Ginkels' architect allies Ray Affleck, Victor Prus, and Claude Robillard ( responsible for Terre des Hommes as theme), all of whom had been on PQAA retreat - Burchard's work as an architectural historian was already well known: he had recently published an important history of American architecture and was a regular contributor to architecture magazines. 66 Other intellectual links to MIT were well established via ideas - including those of Gyorgy Kepes or Kevin Lynch - emanating from its Joint Center for Urban Studies with Harvard (where key Expo 67 staff architects had studied city planning). Yet unbeknownst to the Montebello c onferees, Burchard's enthusiasm - and ideology - drew on his immersion in a highly influential project, developed by American \"action intellectuals\" throughout the 1950s, of reimaging geopolitical propaganda. If a key ambition of Montebello lay in 64 John E. Burchard, \"Human ity: Our , Architectural Record (July 1951): 65 Burchard, \"Memorandum of Suggestions Concerning Terre des Hommes Exhibition Montreal, 1967\" , 7-8. 66 For ways in Montebello, see: Series D03.9 -109-26-TD, Fonds Guy Desbarats, Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal. 438 definin g a theme meant to eclipse nation -state hegemony (thereby reimaging a proper role for Canada), then it would be undertaken by absorbing, however unconsciously, already established theories - on culture as an instrument of global modernisation - fashioned f or winning rhetorical battles in a global cold war. World's fairs, as \"soft\" propaganda, were central to this ambition. The post -national ecumenism espoused by the van Ginkels and at Montebello echoed exhibition strategies developed in key American intel lectual circles crucial to foreign policy since the Second World War. Responding to worries over foreign perceptions of the United States as a superpower, the idea was to diminish the nation -state as a symbol while rigorously defending national interests by projecting images of modernity that, as the liberal historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. put it, could offer views on how \"to master and apply the technological revolution to human life\". 67 Schlesinger had contributed to a select committee of businessmen, m edia executives, labour leaders, and intellectuals charged by the United States Information Agency (USIA) with defining the ethos of the American contribution to the 1958 Brussels Universal and International Exposition, the first postwar world's fair. Its theme was noteworthy: \"A New Humanism\", meant to promote the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and better international relations (along with Belgian colonisation) . 68 President 67 Arthur Schlesinger Jr., quoted in Robert W. Rydell, \"The New Day Dawns: The American Pavilion at the 1958 Brussels World's Fair\", in World of Fairs: The Century -of-Progress Exhibitions (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1993), 196. Schlesinger full comment was on confronting the view that \"Communism is the only way to master and apply the technological revolution to human life.\" 68 Rydell, \"The New Day Dawns: The American Pavilion the 1958 Brussels World's Fair\", 193; Felicity Scott, \"Encounters with The Face of America \", in Antoine Picon and Alessandra Ponte, eds., Architecture and the Sciences: Exchanging Metaphors (New York: Princeton Architectural Press, 2003), 257-258. 439 Dwight D. Eisenhower had, in fact, famously addressed the United Nations on December 8, 1953, one year after the first American hydrogen bomb test in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, and demanded a multi -national effort at donating a specific quantity of fissionable material for \"peaceful\" purposes - a theme (otherwise meant to counter Soviet \"peace propaganda\") leading to the USIA Atoms for Peace exhibitions seen by millions worldwide from 1954 to 1958. 69 Stemming from discussions on how to present thermonuclear power to both the American public and the world, Atoms for Peace - travelling by truck caravan to major cities in Europe, Asia, and Africa with smaller shows sent to 217 USIA posts abroad - brilliantly showcased the peaceful applications of atomic energy in working models, colourful displays, short films, and public lectures. 70 The successful installation at the 1955 Indian Industries Fair in New Delhi displayed a full -scale mock-up of the graphite reactor in Brookhaven, New York, with sixty young multilingual Indian guides, all graduate students in physics or scientific disciplines, making comprehensible the uses of nuclear energy and technologies to audiences from a nation nervously viewed by American policymakers as a 69 Dwight D.

At the same moment as Atoms for Peace, the United States began providing equipment and information to domestic and foreign research institutions including civilian nuclear reactors in Iran and Pakistan, while the CIA and State Department launch ed extensive opinion polls in foreign countries to elicit popular attitudes on nuclear weapons . 440 leader of an emerging Non -Aligned Movement (fig. 7.10).71 An unprecedented success, Atoms for Peace presented a new form of psychological warfare: no longer limited to the unilateral signal of print or broadcast propaganda (for example, The Voice of America), the promotion of things like the \"peaceful\" atom was premised on cultural exchanges of long duration, with arts and technology experienced live, at full scale, and in many languages. As such, Atoms for Peace participated in a greater project of fashioning Pax Americana through theories on modernisation - purposely engineered in academia - that saw Western, industrial, capitalist democracies, and the United States in particular, as the pinnacle of world history. 72 The worldview, seen as meeting the challenge of \"A New Humanism\" at Brussels, owe d to a unique institutional origin: the powerful Center for International Studies (CENIS) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Building on major their contributions to military technology - including radar and the atomic bomb - during the Second World War, MIT scientists and now especially social scientists became crucial to providing information - research - useful to policymaking in the 1950s. Funded by the Central Intelligence Agency and the Ford Foundation, CENIS was, as team member Walt 71 Jack Masey and Conway Lloyd Morgan, Cold War Confrontations: US Exhibitions and Their Role in the Cultural Cold War (Baden, Switzerland: Lars M\u00fcller Publisher s, 2008) , 36-57. A graduate of the Yale School of Art and Architecture, Masey began his career with the United States State Department as an Exhibits Officer in New Delhi. He continue d with the USIA to organise exhibitions worldwide and work ed closely with architects on fashioning a technologically sophisticated view on postwar American life - epitomised by Fuller's geodesic domes at Kabul (1956), Moscow (1959), and, of course, Montreal. 72 Michael E. Latham, Modernization as Ideology: American Social Science and \"Nation Building\" in the Kennedy Era (Chapel Hill NC: The University of North Carolina Press, 2000) , 4. 441 Whitman Rostow put it, \"to bring to bear academic research on issue of public policy\" .73 Among its key areas of research was communications studies centred on psychological and behavioural models for exploring and predicting public opinion. Rostow, an economist, political theorist, and anti -Communist, who had identified bombing targets while serving with Schlesinger in the Office of Strategic Services (precursor to the CIA) during the war, fervently argued for \"interdisciplinary\" studies promoting modernisation through foreign investment and development planning, thereby fostering democracy in \"third world\" countries. His views would crystallise in a unique commencement ceremony in June 1961 : as the newly appointed deputy national security advisor, he addressed eighty military officers, wearing the uniforms of twenty dif ferent national armies at their graduation from the counter -guerrilla course run at the U.S. Army Special Warfare Center, and insisted that when facing \"old societies... trying to change to gain a position in the modern world and to take advantage of the ben efits of technology\", the United States and its allies had to intervene directly in \"the whole creative process of modernization\". 74 In this schema, Western, 73 Walt Rostow, quoted in Latham, Modernization as Ideology: American Social Science and \"Nation Building\" in the Kennedy Era , 54; James Schwoc h, Global TV: New Media and the Cold War, 1946 -69 (Urbana IL: University of Illinois Press, 2009), 63. 74 Walt W. Rostow, \"Countering Guerrilla Warfare\" (1961), in Franklin Mark Osanka, ed., Modern Guerrilla Warfare: Fighting Communist Guerrilla Movements, 1941- 1961 (New York: The Free Press of Glencoe, 1962) , 465, 471. The \"whole creative process of modernization\" included not only counter -insurgency military officers but \"those others who are committed to help fashion independent, modern societies\": \"doc tors, teachers, economic planners, agricultural experts, civil servants\". The greater arc of MIT modernisation theory was suggested in the kinds of non -military fields being targeted by organisations such as the Peace Corps. Rostow concluded his address by referring specifically to Vietnam, where counterinsurgency planning had already been spatialised in the Strategic Hamlet Program. Along with Rostow, John F. Kennedy brought members of the MIT group directly into the White House after winning the presid ential election in November 1960. As senator from Massachusetts, Kennedy had approached the MIT centre for advice on policy proposals on South Asian development. In the migration from academia to government, Rostow epitomised the \"action 442 industrial, capitalist democracies, and the United States in particular, would appear at the apex of nations because of historical development (the Communists, in only propagating guerrilla war, were, Rostow concluded, \"the scavengers of the modernization process\"). From this summit, one giving an unimpeded view on human progress, the creative constru ction of modernisation would also be exercised through the arts. Here lay the USIA approach to MIT. In trying to balance earlier recommendations on showcasing only cultural aspects of American life at Brussels, the USIA asked John Ely Burchard, MIT's in fluential dean of humanities and architectural historian , to request his colleagues \"to undertake the task of providing a definition of the culture and sociological impact of technology together with the most recent advances in that technology\". 75 Burchard had, in fact, been ins trumental to the birth of CENIS: in 1950, the U.S. State Department approached MIT for assistance on Project Troy, an effort to combat the USSR's effective jamming of Voice of America broadcasts; the resulting team of engineers and s ocial scientists, led by Burchard, proposed complementing their technical investigation with an examination of the larger benefits to be achieved by communicating with Soviet citizens (while assessing the possibilities of a total campaign of information ov erload that was labelled \"political warfare\"). 76 Earlier, he had worked in the Office of Scientific Research and intellectuals\" o f the Kennedy administration. See: Latham, Modernization as Ideology: American Social Science and \"Nation Building\" in the Kennedy Era, 1 -2, 56 -57. 75 Letter from the United States Commissioner General for the Brussels Exhibition to John Burchard, quoted in \"Progress Report on the U.S. Exhibition at the Brussels Fair\", Interiors 117 (September 1957): 135; Masey and Morgan, Cold War Confrontations: US Exhibitions and Their Role in the Cultural Cold War , 114. 76 Latham, Modernization as Ideology: American Social Science and \"Nation Building\" in the Kennedy Era , 44. 443 Development under Vannevar Bush, the former MIT vice president and engineer who had presided over the spending of $450 million on weapons research and development during the Second World War - a powerful authority granted to science that Bush envisioned, shortly before atomic bombs were dropped on Japan, as contributing to peacetime progress. 77 Now, Burchard was crucial to the purposeful comingli ng of the humanities, sciences, social sciences, and engineering. Thus, when responding to the USIA request for conceptualising the Brussels fair, he invited authorities from these very disciplines to a weekend retreat in April 1957 at MIT, where he, Rost ow, and their CENIS colleagues Max F. Millikan (a development economist) and Ithiel de Sola Pool (a major theorist of communications research), joined USIA officials, prominent scientists, and MIT design professor Gyorgy Kepes as well as visiting instructo r and architect Bernard Rudofsky, to fashion \"A Society in Ferment\", a theme on American culture as arising from the advantages of advanced technologies - automation, communications, electrification, transportation - generating a life of increasing leisure. 78 Rudofsky would end up working with the Yale - trained architect Peter G. Harnden, a former U.S. Army intelligence officer who had become the chief exhibition organiser of the Marshall Plan in Germany and pioneered postwar 77 Stuart W. Leslie, The Cold War and American Science: The Military -Industrial- Academic Complex at MIT and Stanford (New York: Columbia University Press, 1993), 6- 7; Vannevar Bush, \"As We May Th ink\", The Atlantic (July 1945). Burchard described wartime research and design at MIT in his book Q.E.D.: M.I.T. in World War Two (1948). 78 Robert H. Haddow, Pavilions of Plenty: Exhibiting American Culture Abroad in the 1950s (Washington and London: Smi thsonian Institution Press, 1997), 94ff; Scott, \"Encounters with The Face of America \", 263; Rydell, \"The New Day Dawns: The American Pavilion at the 1958 Brussels World's Fair\", 199. 444 techniques on promoting the \"Ame rican way of life\", on The Face of America , an exhibition installed inside the architect Edward Durrell Stone's enormous cylindrical pavilion at Brussels and showcasing \"man -made\" artefacts ranging from household technologies to shopping streetscapes along with \"loop films\" capturing impressions of everyday life : \"the surprise of a crack train, of Jones Beach on a crowded Sunday, of rush hour on the subway, of a San Francisco Chinese reastauraunt, a Pizzeria, and a Kosher shop (under the heading 'Melting po t-au-feu'). The Grand Canyon is omitted simply because it is expected - and known.\" 79 The overall impression - of showing fairgoers a United States in which anxieties about nuclear power and automation had been refashioned into a world of leisure and consumer freedom - suggested an ironic, even somewhat dystopic sense of American culture. Indeed, Rostow had, when chairing a subgroup on \"American Idealism in Action\" at the MIT retreat, adamantly argued that any panoramic view of the United States necessarily include \"problems\" such as racial desegregation that would be \"underlined rather than evaded by omission\"; the resulting exhibition, The Unfinished Work , displayed in a separate structure outside Stone's pavilion, concentrated on \"three areas: the Negro, the City and Nature\" - an exercise designed, in Rostow's words, to express \"the American commitment to struggle towards its peculiar version of common Western aspirations\". 80 The deliberate 79 \"Progress Report on the U.S. Exhibition at the Brussels Fair\", Interiors 117, 140. See also: Greg Castillo, Cold War on the Home Front: The Soft Power of Midcentury Design (Minneapolis; University of Minnesota Press, 2010), xiii; Sarah Nilsen, Projecting America, 1958: Film and Cultural Diplomacy at the Brussels World's Fai r (Jefferson NC: McFarland & Co mpany, Inc., 2011), 144ff. 80 Walter Rostow, quoted in Michael L. Krenn, \"'Unfinished Business': Segregation and U.S. Diplomacy at the 1958 World's Fair\", Diplomatic History Vol. 20, No. 4 (Fall 1996): 595 -596; Masey and Morg an, Cold War Confrontations: US Exhibitions and Their Role in the Cultural Cold War , 128- 145. Rostow's emphasis on 445 lessening of nation -state triumphalism accorded perfectly with the CENIS aim to shape international perceptions of the United States through programmes of \"soft\" cultural propaganda. The \"faces\" of America continued the work of the MIT intellectuals, who sought throughout the 1950s to create empirical benchmarks on overall patterns - economic organisation, political structures, and social values - of global transformation that were to be leveraged by policymakers on wining \"hearts and minds\" through the benevolent extension of Western technology. 81 The grand paradigm was always to advance progress, which, in the guise of world's fairs - that is, in the inheritance of a nineteenth -century ideal - inevitably led to visions on nation -building. In all this, a critical link between Cold War modernisation theory and architecture culture would bear on Expo 67. Burchard's work at CENIS was otherwise complemented by his role as an architectural historian. His appointment as the first dean of humanities and social sciences at MIT, a position meant specifically to balance technical education, stemmed from this disciplinary foundation. Among his many roles at MIT, Burcha rd had managed the Albert Farewell Bemis Foundation (AFBF), an institution named after its industrialist \"unfinished business\" was also to counter the USSR's accusations of \"racial terror\" in the American South, a retort to American complaints on Soviet repression of the 1956 Hungarian uprising. The exhibit inspired considerable backlash from many American officials and especially Southern congressmen. The Unfinished Work was sponsored by Fortune magazine and designed by its art director Leo Li onni, who had, along with Laszlo Moholy- Nagy, Gyorgy Kepes, and Herbert Bayer, previously been commissioned to create advertisements for the Container Corporation of America by its influential chairman Walter Paepcke. Before turning to MIT, the USIA had solicited advice from business leaders including Paepcke, who suggested: \"The best exhibits would be American intellectuals in all fields, who could conduct seminars while the fair was in progress\"; see: Rydell, \"The New Day Dawns: The American 1958 Brussels World's Fair\", 196. 81 Rydell, \"The New Day Dawns: Pavilion at the 1958 Brussels World's Fair\", 203; Latham, Modernization as Ideology: American Social Science and \"Nation Building\" in the Kennedy Era , 3-7. 446 patron who had studied and promoted modular theory and the prefabrication of housing in the 1930s - an undertaking symbolising the social power of technology and free enterprise.82 The AFBF mission both influenced the architecture curriculum and accorded with a postwar institution promoting \"rationalisation\" in interdisciplinary research and government policy. Burchard came, however, to reconsider his e arlier position, noting that his compilation of efforts in prefabrication during the 1930s had \"serious defects\" including \"an inordinate interest in the engineering detail\" - read: design - \"of the various proposals and an inadequate interest in all other factors which might determine success or failure.\" 83 The mea culpa was mitigated by a hopeful sense of balancing postwar technicism: \"A study of the state of the art stands therefore at the crossroads of the applied physical and social sciences, an appropriate place for a teacher at M.I.T. to stand.\" 84 Befitting a new academic dean (and leader of Project Troy), the sentiment not only suggested the mission of, say, CENIS but reflected new humanistic overtones of discourses on science and technology, includi ng architecture, in response to the traumas of war (and now nuclear holocaust). It was, above 82 Avigail Sachs, \"The Pedagogy of Prefabrication: Building Research at MIT in the Postwar\", in Arindum Dutta, ed., MIT, Architecture, and the 'Techno -Social' Moment (Cambridge MA: The MIT Press, 2013) , 232 - 236. Burchard assisted Bemis on preparing The Evolving House , a th ree-volume study on industrialised housing published between 1933 and 1938. 83 John E. Burchard, \"Introduction\", in Burnham Kelly, The Prefabrication of Houses: A S tudy by the Albert Farwell Bemis Foundation of the P refabrication Industry in the United Sta tes (Cambridge MA and New York : The Technology Press of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and John Wiley and Sons Inc., 1951), vii. Kelly succeeded Burchard as director of the AFBF in 1948. The AFBF maintained an enormous archive on prefabricatio n in architecture; as Burchard noted, in word befitting an MIT administrator and CENIS cold warrior: \"The files of the Bemis Foundation, though far from complete, were certainly among the largest in the country. The Foundation was frequently sought out by visitors, especially from abroad, who were seeking the truth about a business concerning which many half -truths or untruths were being said\" (viii). 84 Ibid., ix. 447 all, a statement on some form of aesthetic, social, and technological synthesis for postwar society, an extension perhaps of Sigfried Giedion's \"New Monumentality\" in terms of a Indeed, Burchard believed Giedion's \"most durable\" thesis remained \"that the modern movement will attain no stature until it aims at monumental expression based on modern concepts of space.\" 86 The remark expressed his fear, growing throughout the 1950s and summarised in an 1960 issue of Daedalus on \"The Visual Arts Today\" specially edited by Gyorgy Kepes, of, first, an irreconcilable division between architecture and the fine arts, and, second, a generation of socially unconscious artists and architects. 87 On the one hand lay Kepes's forceful vision : ...the enormous expansion of human conflict in World War II and its consequences made so many ideas seem shallow that I was impelled, like many othe rs, to search for values rather than tools. The social horizon, with its immense and seemingly insoluble problems, did not seem to contain the key to these values. The scientific revolution, with its menaces, benefactions, and promises, did seem to open an emotional window. Basically, I felt, the world made newly visible by science contained the essential symbols for our reconstruction of physical surroundings and for the restructuring of the world of sense, feeling, and thought within us. I was drawn t o the converging contributions made by art and science, and to the distillation of the images common to our expanding inner and outer worlds. 88 85 Reinhold Martin, \"The MIT Chapel: An Interdiscursive History\", in Arindum Dutta, Architecture, and the 'Techno -Social' Moment (Cambridge MA: The MIT Press, 2013) , 75-76, 95. 86 John Burchard and Albert Bush- Brown, The Architecture of America: A Social and Cultural History (1961; London: Victor Gollancz Ltd, 1967), 356. Bush -Brown wa s an architectural historian and Burchard's colleague at MIT. Their book was originally commissioned to mark the American Institute of Architects centennial in 1957. 87 John E.

His first sentence revealed the social objectives of these visual studies: \"Today we experience chaos ... our common life has lost its coherency.\" His examples of new typography and paintings, his analysis of texture, focus and spatial patterns revealed an open desire to relate manifold discrete aspects of modern thought. Still in 1960 the problem of communicating ideas visually was not as near solution as it had been in the Middle Ages or the Renaissance. The old common symbols had been discarded and there were no n ew and common ones. 91 89 Burchard and Bush -Brown, The Architecture of America: A Social and Cultural History, 251, 374. Burchard was otherwise appreciative of Kepes's attempt at revealing an aesthetic unity in the arts and sciences: in The Language of Vision (1944), \"he [Kepes] tried to apply the Gestalt psychology to optical communication. His first sentence revealed the social objectives of these vi sual studies: 'Today we experience chaos... our common life has lost its coherency'\" (346). 90 Burchard, \"Humanity: Our Client\" , 97. Burchard quoted a passage from Giedion's Space, Time and Architecture (1941) on restoring \"feeling\" in town planning. Burc hard aimed especially at restoring \"history\" - as means to consider \"the direction of the culture as manifested by its ethics and its public policy\" - in face of a growing (but worrisome ) embrace of \"Science\". Introducing his article, the Architectural Re cord noted that \"the same swing toward 'emotional content' has lately appeared in critical writings of Eero Saarinen, Burchard \" AND Art\", Architectural Record (July 1951): 85. 91 Burchard and Bush -Brown, The Architecture of America: A Social and Cultural History, 346. 449 While admiring Giedion's and Kepes's \"social objectives\" to restore order to \"chaos\", Burchard adopted a more overtly spiritual, even theological, line when considering the role of contemporary architecture. 92 Eschewing symbols - arch itecture - in favour of values , he argued in 1951: Thus living religions have, regardless of their absolute values, managed to afford a transcendent communion linking every man of the culture to the fellowman of his culture and have created in this sense a sort of anonymity in which the individual was of minor consequence. 93 A decade later, when concluding a lengthy survey on American architecture, he continued (rhetorically using the past tense to summon present times): The greatest architectures have ris en in support of religion. It is possible that this is not essential but the important thing is that there should be a strong common belief, religious or not.... Had any building types emerged that seemed so desirable to Americans that they would lavish up on them kindred sacrifices of extra money, extra labor, extra love, such as we think were brought to the Acropolis or to Mont St. Michel? If there were no such dominant types, was the pluralistic society nonetheless reaching towards an agreement on some common values to be expressed by many architects, ordinary and extraordinary, to be accepted, even admired, by many people, not only by a few self-indoctrinating critics and connoisseurs, to be offered and accepted as a record not only of what the times mig ht have been like in twentieth -century America but also of what the times were like? 94 Here lay the full import of the Montebello report. Rather than advancing through \"dominant types\" - again, architectures - postwar society was poised to extend itself t hrough 92 Martin, \"The MIT Chapel: Bush -Brown, The Architecture of America: A Social and Cultural History , 449. 450 \"common values\" - the Expo 67 themes - of a new universal humanism.95 This could, as Burchard noted in reply to the CCWE deputy commissioner C.F. Carsley, arise in the Place des Peuples proposed by the Montebello group - but it would really take roo t in the \"theme area\", which represented a \"workable and interesting\" approach to translating the spirit behind \"a very high-minded report\" into \"material which the man in the street can find entertaining as well as instructive.\" 96 Material did not mean on ly displays; rather, \"in a program of this sort the chances are that progress is made most rapidly by development of concrete material suggestions which can be examined and criticized\" - and, \"By concrete, of course, I mean actual drawings and site relatio ns, etc., since I think the report of the Montebello conference is as concrete as a report of this kind can perhaps become.\" 97 Concrete stood to suggest equally durable architectural and cultural expressions. There was no contradiction between the spiritual and secular claims made for Terre des Hommes . Rather than technocracy, technology was to be valued as fulfilling the needs of intellectual curiosity, liberation from work, and entertainment; rather than sectarianism, a new spiritual sense of humanism was to be felt in themes uniting the many aspect of \"man\". 95 \"Humanism\" represented, to Burchard, the survival of \"contemporary architecture as a new expression of the growing spirit of Western man\" once threatened by \"the pagan reaction of Nazism and Fascism\" and now facing the \"the Tartar threat of Russian absolutism, under which no new art can survive\". The corollary between Cold War victory and aesthetic triumph (or even some avant -garde spirit) was clear: \"for it is the Western World and not the communist world which has a revolutionary character. If one doubts this on the political front he may examine it on the aesthetic front.\" See: Burchard, \"H umanity: Our Burchard, Letter to C.F. Carsley, Deputy Commissioner General, Canadian World Exhibition Corporation (June 18, 1963): 1 -2, Folder 9, Series 2, D03.9 -109-26-TD, Fonds Guy Desbarats, Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal. 97 Ibid., 2 . 451 In the context of the host nation, it found expression in renewing a sense of Canadian identity that, on the one hand, was seen, at least in the mirror of Expo 67, as somehow uniting technology and rationalism to oppose nationalism (or isolationism) and irrationalism - a line also informing a postwar liberal continentalism that anticipated an increasingly shared historical horizon, whether in the hemispheres of culture or geopolitics. 98 As a leading Canadian exponent presumed in early 1950s: These so -called \"alien\" American influences are not alien at all; they are just the natural forces that operate in the conditions of twentieth -century civilization.... The root cultural problem in our modern mass -democracies is this relationship between the mass culture, which is in danger of being further debased with every new invention in mass communications, and the culture of the few. The United States is facing this problem at a rather more advanced stage th an we have yet reached, and the more intimately we can study the American experience the more we shall profit. 99 Yet Burchard's appeal would, on the other hand, also resonate with a strong line of Canadian Idealism shaping ideas - and policies - on postwar culture and geopolitics, in which a \"lament\" for nationhood was predicted in the face of a heedless absorption of technology and 98 Karel D. Bicha, \"Five Canadian Historians and the USA: Frank Underhill, Arthur Lower, Donald Creighton, WL Morton and Kenneth McNaught\", The American Review of Canadian Studies 29, no. 2 (Summer, 1999): 195.

Underhill, \"Notes on the Massey Report\", Th e Canadian Forum (August 1951): 102. Underhill, a prominent journalist, historian, and political thinker, who advocated stronger Canadian ties to the United States (not least due to his anti -monarchism), was commenting on the recently completed Report of the Royal Commission on National Development in the Arts, Letters and Sciences , which irrevocably reshaped cultural norms in postwar Canada. On Underhill's liberal continentalism and acceptance of American influence on Canadian life, see: Karel D.

Some of the reasons are suggested in an earlier chapter: vast distances, a scattered populati on, our youth as a nation, easy dependence on a huge and generous neighbour. But while engaged in these material matters we were confronted with new problems which we share with all modern states. \"Unfortunately\", says the author of one of our special studies, \"just as in the western world, we are beginning to understand how deeply our spiritual traditions need guarding, just as we are ready to divert some of our energy from technology for that purpose, our society is being challenged to defend itself aga inst a barbaric empire which puts its faith in salvation by the machine. We are tempted to forget the spiritual necessity in the face of the more present danger.\" The tidal wave of technology can be more damaging to us than to countries with older cultural traditions possessing firmer bulwarks against these contemporary perils. 101 100 The most famous reaction against Americanism, technological ad vance, and continentalism appeared in the conservative historian George Grant's influential book Lament for a Nation of 1965. Grant epitomised a middle generation of Canadian idealism that sought to defend political and religious status quo while demandin g a nationalist spirit as bulwark to absorption by American technological modernity; this was, broadly speaking, a project of the political right, though one that shared little of emergent American conservatism (or neo-conservatism). See: Robert Meynell, Canadian Idealism and the Philosophy of Freedom: C.B. Macpherson, George Grant, and Charles Taylor (Montreal and Kingston ON: McGill- Queen's University Press, 2011). 101 Royal Commission on National Development in the Arts, Letters and Sciences, Report of t he Royal Commission on National Development in the Arts, Letters and Sciences (Ottawa: King's Printer, 1951), 272, www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/2/5/h5 -400-e.html. The concluding ambition was to establish institutions (for the arts, sciences, and education) directly through the appropriation of federal funds. Under the advice of its patrician chairman, the lawyer and diplomat (and future Governor General) Vincent Massey, the Commission, which had held official hearings and solicited suggestions from constit uencies across the country, studiously avoided the word \"culture\" for fear of sounding \"elitist\". Elitism was not just highbrow taste but at times equated to anti -Americanism - two sentiments that Massey wished to eschew. See: Claude Bissell, The Massey Report and Canadian Culture (Ottawa: Carleton University Information Office, 1982), 16- 18. 453 Otherwise rarely suffering the binds of either nostalgia or chauvinism, the report's curious quotation of a noted conservative historian suggested a parallel cultural wariness of technological modernity.102 In the limits of geopolitics, the perilous idolatry of technology was seen as the province - and power - of American and Soviet hegemons (between which Canada lay wedged). To confront cold war polarities was not necessarily to choose sides; rather, it was to defy expectations of deus ex machina by recuperating some spirit of organic - collectivist society. In this conservative idealist paradigm of modern communitarianism, in which individualism was to be measured by assisting the traditions of a commonweal , lay a critique of progress, of an unswerving historical force leading to the heedless conquest of nature. The repeated refrain, no matter how maudlin, of Terre des Hommes was, as discourse, to overcome intellectual fears of a rift between materialist and spiritualist senses of history and mass culture. Thus Huxley's \"transhumanism\" or Saint -Exup\u00e9ry's \" linge\": the desire to promote some sort of cultural synthesis - of renewing bonds between the arts and science, or between thou ght and action - surely appealed to Burchard, whose own search for \"common values\" - expressed as architecture - in a \"pluralistic society\" led him enthusiastically to endorse the Montebello report. Replying to the CCWE Deputy Commissioner General C.F. Carsley, who had sent the group's report along with Pich\u00e9's letter, Burchard wrote: \"I must say I think both of these are admirable and I am 102 The quoted lament for withering spiritual values in the face of technological change came, in fact, from the Royal Commission chairman Vincent Massey's nephew, th e influential conservative historian George Grant. See: Bissell, The Massey Report and Canadian Culture, 17. 454 delighted that you have come out with such a statesmanlike document, which puts to shame the manoeuvres of Mr. Moses in New York.\"103 Wishing to counter the anticipated crass materialism of the 1964 New York world's fair by the \"high -minded\" ideals of Expo 67, Burchard reflected: \"I am glad that the Canadian committee said something that I felt I could not properly say\" - doubtless as an American - \"dealing with the relationship of the celebration of the centenary to the exhibition itself.\" 104 To celebrate the founding of a modern country was to believe in the possibility of reinventing history - a status assumed in New World exceptionalism (which the MIT modernisation theorists had hoped to extend to newly decolonising societies) - with themes replacing politics by the arts and sciences, culture and technology.105 Burchard thus saluted two results of the Montebell o deliberations: first, the inclusion of his original memorandum alongside a report on the Brussels world's fair as key sources of ideas on Expo 67; second, the specific proposal on a \"theme area\" devoted to \"THE EARTH, HOME OF MANKIND (MYSTERES DE LA PLANETE)\" with \"exploration\" organising all fields of human endeavour. 106 Burchard understood the link 103 Burchard, Letter to C.F. Carsley, 1 . Burchard acknowledged that he would be pleased to serve on a supervisory committee and urged that every effort be taken safeguard the exhibition \"in the face of larger forces\" (presumably political ones). 104 Ibid. 105 The Montebello conferees consistently described Canada in exceptional terms: \"Situated as it is, historically and geographically, between Europe and the United States, it has been a land of experiment\". See: \"The Theme 'Terre des Hommes' and Its Development at the Canadian World Exhibition in Montreal, 1967\", Montebello conference report (no date): 2, Series 39 -1990 -07-001, Find Gilles Gagnon, Canadian Centre for Letter to C.F.

It surely gave satisfaction that ideas on promoting the United States in 1958 were now elevated to emblematise the \"world\". At Expo 67, the construction of Canadian modernity appeared in this long discourse on world's fairs, techno-science, the nation -state, and the cold war. Tensions between \"spiritual and material aspirations\" were, as both the van Ginkels and the Montebello conferees wished, to be perfectly mediated by exploration , a theme not only capturing the full import of \"transhumanism\" but granting Canada an extraordinary prognostic value - \"the perfect stage for the glorification of nature\"; \"a highly suitable theatre for the study of man today\" - on expressing multiple forms of global fraternity. 107 While coded in aspects of the MIT work on cultural propaganda, the Canadian ambition was not necessarily to produce an equivalent Pax Americana. Nevertheless, it shared the desire to present pacific scapes of modernisation: by \"transcending boundaries\", \"modern man\" h ad arrived at a point where, \"having learned to escape the law of universal gravitation, the abilities he has developed now impel him to attack the evils which heretofore have been part and parcel of his existence.\" 108 These were the early hopes of early 1963. In the end, with the ceding of themes to dedicated pavilions, Canada would no longer retain the status - of reorganis ing la terre des hommes - 107 \"The Theme 'Terre des Hommes' and its Development at the Canadian World Exhibition in Montreal, 1967\", 1. 108 Ibid. 456 first imagined by the architects and later at Montebello. Instead of mapping an alternative geography of th e \"world\", it would, like other countries, have to attend a nation -state interest. Canada would, in the end, build its pavilion. Costing $22 million, it was, with Habitat 67, the most expensive building at Expo 67. Canada had, in fact, been defined at Montebello: In dealing with the question of Confederation, the theme of unity in diversity should be dealt with; particularly in respect to the universality of this problem. Canadian unity should be presented not as a \"fait accompli\", but as a challenge an d a search. This spirit of challenge and questioning, rather [than] a self - satisfied sense of achievement, should also animate the presentation of all thematic material. 109 The difference between 1963 and 1967 was that on February 15, 1965, Canada adopted a national flag . 110 Still, instead of a nation, the pavilion was , much like the growth of the country, a collection of regions: the Atlantic Provinces with an unremarkable box; Quebec inside an elegant glass container floating at the edge of the complex wit hin its own moat; Ontario underneath irregularly peaked space frame roofs of glass -fibre panels; and the Western provinces combined in an apparently suitable \"organic\" mound made of Douglas fir tiles and rising parabolically to enclose tall trees inside (f ig. 7.11). The buildings were set around an 11.5-acre site. At its centre arose a massive 109 -foot high inverted pyramid (fig. 109 Ibid., 12 . The idea that Canada represented a veritable \" Terre des Hommes\" was articulated by Daniel van Ginkel and others at the seminal PQAA retreat some months earlier; see : van Ginkel, H. Mayerovitch, et al., \"Le \u00e8me\", 1-13. The architects Rob illard, Affleck, and Prus, all present at the PQAA meeting and sympathetic to the van Ginkels ideas, were official participants at Montebello. 110 The Canadian national flag was adopted on February 15, 1965. It replaced the British Union Flag, though the C anadian Red Ensign had been unofficially flown since the late nineteenth century. 457 7.12). Designed by the firm Ashworth, Robbie, Vaughan and Williams, the outstretched form - named Katimavik, the Inuktitut wor d for \"meeting place\" - was, as an official guidebook offered, to suggest \"the constant expansion of Canada's horizons. It reflects Canada's devotion to the tenets of humanism.\"111 Climbing far above the fairgrounds to a platform running the perimeter of the pavilion, visitors actually turned inward to descend into the inverted apex . Along the deep sloping planes on which rested enormous reconstructions of primitive masks and mechanical instruments. Devoted to \"time\", \"space and distance\", \"nature\", and, finally, \"man\", the artefacts - a sundial or an atomic clock; a compass or a radio telescope; huge sculptures of carrot seeds or lotus blossoms; masks representing Greco-Roman, African, Japanese, or Native American cultures - stood to represent the evolutionary process of humanity (fig. 7.13). The juxtaposition of the archaic and the modernising was conceived as a reverse trajectory of history, returning Canada to some common folklore, however invented - or, as the head of the Canadian Government Committee for Expo 67 put it: We coined terms from prefixes and suffixes of the Latin and Greek - they had the sounds of pharmaceuticals and paint, of science fiction and the carboniferous era. Thus \"Katimavik\": 111 Fran\u00e7ois (Ottawa: Queen's Printer, 1967 ), 3. As an official film put it, the pavilion was \"an ope n hand towards the sky\" symbolis ing \"the Canadian people reaching for a better future\" ; see: Marc Beaudet, dir., The Canadian Pavilion, Expo 67 , film (Montreal: National Film Board of Canada, 1967). Ashworth, Robbie, Vaughan and Williams emerged in the early 1960s from the office of Peter Dickinson, the important but prematurely deceased British \u00e9migr\u00e9 architect. For anecdotes on the Canadian pavilion, see: John Lownsbrough, The Best Place to Be: Expo 67 and Its Time (Toronto: Penguin Canada, 2012), 87 -94. 458 In the right connotation, and with supporting words, it can say \"gathering place for those who wish to understand the world\".112 Deep in the bowl of the upturned pyramid, each visitor, gazing at the larger -than -life forms projecting against the sky, stood to portray \"the place of man in his universe\". 113 If this was to be a visceral but intimate reckoning with the durability of human consciousness, ensuring the stability of \"values\" sought in so many philosophical sources from Saint-Exup\u00e9ry to Huxley to Burchard, then it was almost inevitable that it would b e countered by some mediatic pull elsewhere. Thus, under the low white \"plastic pyramids\" exhibition buildings spreading outward from Katimavik, the \" immense Canadian display proper\" ultimately appeared. 114 In distinction to the contemplative scape above, visitors were subjected to a three -part history of the host nation now reduced to \"Growth\" (from \"the feeling of strife - torn early times, when a farmer plowing his field had to pick up his musket in alarm as sounds of gunfire reverberated in the woods near by\" to a society \"urban and industrialized, yet still dependent on the big land\"), \"Resources and Energy\" (\"Walk through a simulated coal mine\"), and \"Transportation and Communications\" (\"Elsewhere, television, the microwave, and Canadian filmmaking are on continual show\"). 115 Terre des Hommes was finally invoked in the mastering of the \"world\" by machines - an often harsh reality elevated 112 H. Leslie Brown, Commissioner General for the Canadian Pavilion, quoted in Kuffert, A Great Duty: Canadian Responses to Modern Life and Mass Culture, 1939 -1967, 231. At the time of his appointment, Brown was a career civil servant with the Canadian D epartment of Trade and Commerce. 113 H\u00e9bert, \"Katimavik\", 13. 114 Expo 67 Memorial Album , 112. 115 Ibid., 112- 113. 459 to the status of myth when reconstructing Canadian history for the centennial. As visitors walked through a mock oil pipeline - or , like everywhere elsewhere at Expo 67, entered film projections, multimedia environments, and carousel theatres - the triumph of the carboniferous - \"the conquest of our natural environment\", \"the wealth that lies beneath our farms and forests\" , \"the Canadian forest remains inexhaustible\" - became a paean to resource exploitation and economic nationalism (fig. 7.14).116 More than the victory of machines, the technological utopianism - evinced in the pavilion Commissioner General's wry sense of \"prefixes and suffixes\", of uni - or -ion , poly - or -trope - offered visitors (that is, Canadians) a direct view on how their late modern society was quite literally being constructed. When defining the role of arts in the Centennial celebrations, a commit tee of Canadian intellectuals had declared: \"The cultural climate has been warmed by the many thousands of new Canadians, by the spread of higher education, and by the imminence of the age of leisure.\" 117 Despite the trope of \"leisure\", and notwithstanding the new realms of information being communicated at Expo 67, this was not quite yet post-industrial society. In fact, the representations of a resource economy (ideally dirigiste ) as base of an expansive welfare state - immigration , education , leisure - accorded with the historical actuality of Expo 67: a neo- 116 Beaudet, The Canadian Pavilion, Expo 67 . Between 1955 and 1965, American domination of the Canadian economy continued to grow: 70 percent ow nership of the petroleum and natural gas industry, 50 percent of mining and smelting, 40 percent of general manufacturing, and 95 percent of automobile manufacturing; see: J.A. Lower, Canada: An Outline History (Toronto: McGraw -Hill Ryerson Limited, 1973), 207-209. Among the most influential voices on economic nationalism was Walter Gordon, the Minister of Finance from 1963 to 1965 (when he had at times reluctantly funded Expo 67), who fervently argued for increased Canadian influence in the development and use of natural resources. See, for example, Gordon's book A Choice for Canada: Independence or Colonial Status (Toronto: McClelland and Stewart, 1966). 117 Canadian Conference of the Arts, Seminar '65 -'67: Report (Montreal and Toronto, 1967) , 1. 460 Keynesian event par excellence - debt expenditure outside historical crisis - appearing at a unique moment of changing postwar prosperity. In the euphoria of Expo 67, or the nationwide Centennial cel ebrations, it seemed impossible to imagine that 1967 was actually nearing the end of an unprecedent ed thirty -year period of growth soon to face a series of irreversible global economic crises. If 1967 represented something truly new, as the Canadian display of modernism and modernisation implied, then it was perhaps seen in a rising late capitalism shaping the systemic mechanisation and specialisation of industry and culture as well as any alignments between \"first\" and \"third\" worlds . This bought , there fore, spaces like Africa Place into regimes of modernity witnessed in, say, the implementation of \"green revolutions\" (or participation at world's fairs). 118 Indeed, Canada represented an image, especially in terms of cold war alignments, of national development - symbolised by wheat production - conceivably bridging the gap between advanced industrialised nations and newly decolonising ones. 119 The idealisation of Canada was, in part, the endurance of a modernist paradigm in which in which absolute values, s uch as nature and technology, were clearly and consistently juxtaposed.120 At the same time, technology was the means by which the continental landmass and its myths were revealed to its citizenry. Now, the last vestiges of Nature (along with the functiona l scapes of modernism: dwelling , 118 Jameson, \"Periodizing the in The Ideologies of Theory: Essays 1971 -1986 (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1988): , \"The Transparent Empire?: Exhibition Strate gy and the Cold War at Expo 67\". 120 Alan Colquhoun, Modern Architecture (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002): 152 . 461 circulation ) were at length to be eliminated.121 The apparently liberative project of \"systems\" was part and parcel of this transformation. So was the cultural logic of the world's fair. If the modernisation of terre des hommes was finally the displacement of man and the world by techno -science, then the full force of domination lay just at the edge of the Canadian precinct. Here, in a slightly forested enclave surrounding a small artificial lake stood the Indians of Canada pavilion (fig. 7.15). Originally proposed by the federal Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, it was largely conceived and organised by First Nations peoples. The representation of an autonomous structure, of being part of but separate from Canadian society, meant confronting patterns laid down in previous international exhibitions, where aboriginal life and art was a footnote to Euro - Canadian displays on agriculture, industry, and culture. 122 The circuit started from a reception built as a kind of longhouse. Inside were explanations on the six large cultural groups of Canadian First Nations . Visitors then entered two rooms describing life before first contact, after which they arrived at displays on \"the land\" and \"th e people\". From here a bridge led toward six elevated hexagonal chambers - always the \"'cellular' construction\" expected by the CCWE, to say nothing of the professed primitivisme of such forms in the 1960s - showing the pressing issues of modern life and surrounding a 100 -foot tall steel and 121 Jameson, \"Periodizing the 60s\", 206. 122 Ruth B.

Phillips, Museum Pieces: Toward the Indigeni zation of Canadian Museums (Montreal and Kingston ON: McGill -Queen's University Press, 2011), 30. Only two Canadian groups appeared outside (but adjacent to) the Canada complex: the Indians of Canada pavilion and the Christian pavilion. On the latter and its remarkable audio -visual displays, see: Monika Kim Gagnon, \"The Christian Pavilion 67: Notes from Charles Gagnon's Archive\", in Kenneally and Sloan, eds., Expo 67: Not Just a Souvenir , 143 -162. 462 wood tower resembling a teepee and symbolising \"the future\"; below it a staircase descended to a campfire and the exit.123 The full entry in the Expo 67 Official Guide read: The Indians of Canada Pavilion on Ile Notre -Dame adjoins the pavilions of the Atlantic Provinces and of Canada. Expo -Express provides convenient access. In all parts of Canada, Indians have discussed and helped to shape their exhibit. Indian painters, carvers and other artists have worked to trans late the concept which evolved into a form of significant expression. Through their exhibit, the Indians of Canada speak to fellow Canadians and to the other peoples against the background of Man and his World. Primarily the Indian people want to present the problems with which they are faced by involvement in a modern technological society, and to affirm their will to preserve the traditional moral and spiritual values of their forefathers. This is a positive expression of Indian thought. While the Can adian Indian approaches the Expo 67 Theme in terms of himself and of his own world, the subject is a common experience of Man. 124 The possible irony of the pavilion actually resting at the extreme edge of Canada but right next to the United Nations was quie tly overlooked. Between the poles of \"problems\" and \"positive expression\" lay a far more pressing message, dramatically displayed in each of the hexagons, on \"the white man\", life\", and \"education\". Alongside brilliantly placed works by contemporary First Nations artists, visitors faced utterly unsentimental, often shocking, portrayals of aboriginal life in an ambivalent discourse on the polarities of tradition al culture 123 The pavilion was designed by J.W. Francis, a br anch architect with Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. See: Phillips and Brydon, \"'Arrow of Truth': The Indians of Canada Pavilion at Expo 67\", 33. 124 Expo 67 Official Guide (Toronto: Maclean -Hunter Publishing Co. Ltd. , 1967). 463 and modern adaptation to a \"world\" dominated by other \"men\".125 Indeed, mid -twentieth - century museums continued to treat aboriginal displays in terms of an \"authentic\" distant past.126 This had been central to constructing modern Canadian identity: during h is London exile, the German architect Gottfried Semper had received the commission to install the Canadian section of the 1851 Great Exhibition; consumed by fashioning an unifying architectural theory, which looked to primitive cultures as sources on moder n ornament and tectonics, Semper collected First Nations artefacts (along with typical displays of machines and furs) and arranged them underneath a massive birch bark canoe hanging from the girders of Joseph Paxton's Crystal Palace (fig. 7.16). 127 Now, instead of practices of connoisseurship and taxonomy perpetuating late -Victorian traditions, the long march of Euro -Canadian civilisation was met at Expo 67 by utterly different, often accusatory, accounts on culture and nationhood. While a sign hanging in t he entryway generously greeted a journalist from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation - \"The Indians of Canada bid you welcome. Walk in our moccasins, the trail from our past. Live with us in the here and now. Talk with us by the fire of the days to co me\" - this past, present, and future was 125 Myra Ruthdale and Jim Miller, \"'It's Our Country': First Nations' Participation in the Indian Pavilion at Expo 67\", Journal of the Canadian Historical Association Vol. 17, no. 2 (2006): 154. The totem pole was sculpted by master carvers Tony and Harry Hunt, in t he Kwakwaka'wakw tradition - atop the 65- foot-high pole was the Thunderbird , which could order lightning to strike . The longhouse (or \"bighouse\") mural was painted by renowned Tseshaht First Nation artist George Clutesi, also known as Thunderbird . 126 Phillips and Brydon, \"'Arrow of Truth': The Indians of Canada Pavilion at Expo 67\", 39. 127 Dickinson's Comprehensive Pictures of the Great Exhibition of 1851 (London : Dickinson, Brothers, Her Majesty's Publishers, 1854): section XI.

As a \"Paleface\" synopsis put it, not unsympathetically: As for the efforts of the first Christian missionaries, the Indians point out: \"Long before they came, we had already talked with God, whom we called the Great Spirit, after our fashion. We lived together like brothers and we saw the Spirit present in everything.\" Smiling faces of Indian children catch the visitor's ey e in the exhibit devoted to education. But they are partly ironic. Among the photographs and the children's drawings, the handicaps facing Indian pupils are detailed. The child must begin at school by learning a foreign tongue, that is, English or Frenc h. And, generally, the white man's style of education is an alien environment to the young Indian. With him it is the sun and the moon which regulate the passing of time. Any clock - regulated timetable is repugnant to him. The school bell startles him. The heroes of our schoolbooks have nothing in common with him. 129 The actual hanging photographs juxtaposed with short declarative texts put it in stark terms: \"Dick and Jane in the storybook are strangers to an Indian boy\" (fig. 7.17). A photograph showi ng children lining up to board a school bus could only recall the dwindling but still extant Indian Residential Schools, the federally funded but religiously administered system of forcibly placing First Nations boys and girls in boarding institutions wher e they were to be 128 \"Expo 67's Indians of Canada\", Expodition , Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, radio broadcast (August 4, 1967), www.cbc.ca/archives/discover/programs/e/expodition/expodition -july-7-1967.html. For a description of journal istic accounts, which were typically sympathetic to the pavilion and its political message , see: Ruthdale and Miller, \"'It's Our Country': First Nations' Participation in the Indian Pavilion at Expo 67\", 166ff. 129 Expo 67 Memorial Album , 121. 465 \"enfranchised\" - or, \"encouraged\" in their \"gradual civilisation\".130 Here, again, alternative geographies - of native reservations, of residential schools - confronted an increasingly fraught scape, once dreamt as situating a new spirit of \"transhumanism\", by entirely different land-use instruments meant to extend a civilising process through isolation and individuation.131 Standing between the Canadian compound and the United Nations, the Indians of Canada pavilion could only but call into question the liberal-capitalist ideology of settler culture, or the \"frontier\" ethic of techno -science imagined as liberating the terre but, here, effectively standing for the subjugation of \"man\". At their most visionary, the architectures of Expo 67 we re to present how life could be newly regulated by design. Yet the confrontation of Indians of Canada pavilion could 130 The Act to Encourage the Gradual Civilization of Indian Tribes in this Province, passed on June 10, 1857, a decade before Confederation, clearly stated the agents and doctrines of colonial administration and indoctrination: III. The Visiting Superintendent of each Tribe of Indians, for the time being, the Missionary to such Tribe for the time being, and such other person as the Governor shall appoint from time to time for that purpose, shall be Commissioners for examining Indians, being members of such Tribe, who ma y desire to avail themselves of this Act, and for makin g due inquiries concerning them : and such Commissioners shall meet for the said purposes at such places and times as the Superintendent General of Indian affairs shall from time to time direct, and sha ll have full power to make such examination and inquiry: and if such Commissioners shall report in writing to the Governor that any such Indian of the male sex, and not under twenty -one years of age, is able to speak, read and write either the English or the French language readily and well, and is sufficiently advanced in the elementary branches of education and is of good moral character and free from debt, then it shall be competent to the Governor to cause notice to be given in the Official Gazette of t his Province, that such Indian is enfranchised under this Act; and the provisions of the third section of the Act aforesaid, and all other enactments making any distinction between the legal rights and liabilities of Indians and those of Her Majesty's other subjects, shall cease to apply to any Indian so declared to be enfranchised, who shall no longer be deemed an Indian within the meaning thereof. For a detailed history of the residential schools, see: Geoffrey Carr, \"House of No Spirit: An Architectural History of the Indian Residential School in British Columbia , PhD dissertation, University of British Columbia (2011), https://circle.ubc.ca/handle/2429/34181. 131 Geoffrey Carr, \"Atopia of the Modern: Revisiting the Place of the Indian Residential School\", English Studies in Canada Vol. 35, No. 1 (March 2009): 117. 466 only show how the very same conditioning of landscapes, resources, laws, had, by design , produced utterly different - and necessarily accu satory - accounts on culture and nationhood outside any conventions of the Centennial or the otherwise long dur\u00e9e of European influence. While the early thematising by the van Ginkels, the Montebello conferees, and others had sympathetically read newly de colonising nations as welcome members , indeed as upholders, of the transhumanism of Expo 67, the reality of the fair, and the three million people visiting the Indians of Canada pavilion, unveiled, however partially, an entirely different account of homegrown colonisation - one never considered when imaging what, exactly, one hundred years of Terre des hommes really looked like. The very same kinds of masks appearing high above in Katimavik were, in the First Nations pavilion, a different reality of the mo dern nation -state. Yet staging \"Indian -ness\" had long been crucial to Canadian constructions of cultural authenticity. Indeed, the nature of monarchical spectacle, still crucial to Canadian life, was grounded by an invented tradition of majesty having an aboriginal aspect. 132 Perhaps expecting a similar romanticism, the Queen of Canada, Elizabeth II, arrived in Montreal aboard the royal yacht Britannia on July 3, 1967. Proceeding through the Canadian precinct, she entered the Indians of Canada pavilion at noon, halfway through her visit (fig. 7.18). 133 She toured it ashen faced and was seen to leave early. 132 Ruthdale and Miller, \"'It's Our Country': First Nations' Participation in the Indian Pavilion at Expo 67\", 122.

Defying the Bureau International des Expositions, which demanded that world exhibitions be dismantled upon closing, Drapeau managed to retain 46 national pavilions, many with new displays, in a permanent exhibition on \"Man and His World\" (fig. 7.19). The claim was economic: a boast that the new show would net $6 million per year. 134 It was more clearly to feed Drapeau's appetite for monuments. 1968 could never be 1967. All the infrastructural upheavals - the highways, the Metro, the islands - and the territorial instruments used to build the world's fair had left a different city and social life in their wake. Drapeau had understood this perfectly. Worried that tourists were driving to the world's fair through the poorer neighbourhoods of the city, he ordered the construction of prettifying blue and white fences - the official colours of Expo 67 - to mask the poverty. 135 Graffiti soon appeared: \"Visitez les Slums\". Else where, meatpacking industries reportedly spent $1 million preventing abattoir odours from floating 134 Jay Walz, \"Expo 67's Sequel Will Open Today\", The New York Times (May 17, 1968): 13. \"Man and His World \" continue d on Ile Ste. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne until 1981. By this time, many of the remaining pavilions had fallen into disrepair. The resulting landscape was used by filmmaker Robert Altman as a post -apocalyptic world for his poorly received science fiction film Quintet of 1979. Drapeau's ambition for even grander spectacles brought the 1976 Olympic Games to Montreal; it took the City of Montreal thirty years to pay off the total cost of $1.61 billion. In 1970, Drapeau had remarked, \"the Olympics can no more have a deficit than a man can have a baby\". 135 Terrance McKenna and Susan Purcell, Drapeau (Toronto and Clarke, Irwin & Company, 1980) , 150 -151. 468 over the fairgrounds.136 The public service was never extended to those living in Pointe - Saint -Charles, the impoverished districts once imagined by the van Ginkels as benefitting from a world's fair dedicated to urban renewal. Drapeau's act of preservation was to believe that the civic euphoria created by an artificial, manicured, and temporary city could somehow be extended to everyday life. It was really the aestheticisation of politics, with the technological aura of Expo 67 anticipated spreading to, thus legitimising, any numbe r of future modernising schemes for Montreal. 137 In this process of massification - of buildings, of people - Drapeau steadfastly m aintained, with monomaniacal zeal, that the populace would herald any large -scale change as another welcome spectacle of modernisation. Yet the totalising urbanism that now defined Montreal - the architecture, engineering, and infrastructure celebrated b y international architects and critics when visiting Expo 67 - had forced a reconsideration of, if not outright lament for , what may have disappeared in its wake. In 1972, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts looked back at the previous decade. In an exhibit ion titled Montreal: Plus or Minus? , curated by the architect- artist Melvin Charney, who had previously advanced au courrant discourses on megastructures and systems in the 1960s, the museum wo rryingly explored the effect of unremitting development. It ai med to reveal the \"fabric of Montreal\" where \"traces of an urban tradition\" were vanishing: 136 \"How the Fair Was Planned\", Progressive Architecture (June 1967): 131. 137 Walter Benjamin, \"The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\" (1936), in Hannah Arendt, ed., Illuminations (New York: Shocken Books, 1968), 217 -251. 469 There are many plans and projects which should have been included in this show, but they were not. The plans for the 1976 Olympic installations; the exact position of the Eastern extension of the Trans -Canada Expressway; the plans for the St Sulpice lands in the centre of the city; the development of office buildings at the Windsor Station site; the plans for federal offices on the site of Montreal's Chinatown. All this is kept secret, through the complicity of 'experts' who tend to remain quiet as long as they get the work.... 138 Pointedly, no architectural designs were presented. Instead photographs, poems, and comic strips portrayed the \"public and communal city\" found \"in the streets, in the parks, in the signs, in the graffiti, in the water we drink, and in the lives we lead.\" 139 Growing social, economic, and political conflicts led the radical poet Andr\u00e9 Major to write: but when you've got nothing better to do you walk along the water's edge along the docks and you wonder whether Montreal has a heart even though you live in the heart of the city140 Major's lines were a coda to a project once predicated on the affirmative modernist discourse of \"The Heart of the City\". Montrealers could only look on as neighbourhoods were destroyed for a new autoroute running along Montreal's continuous east -west escarpment - a site proposed by the van Ginkels many years earlier to avoid demolishing other old districts of the city (which later beca me the spaces of Man in the City). Suggesting a withering of social divisions (typically French versus English) given a common subjugation to the forces of modernisation, Montreal: Plus or Minus? described direct action in social affairs s uch as 138 Melvin Charney, Montr\u00e9al: Plus or Minus? (Montreal: Mont real Museum of Fine Arts, 1972), 16, 20. 139 Ibid., 19. 140 Andr\u00e9 Major, \" Au coeur de la ville\", in Charney, Montr\u00e9al: Plus or Minus? , 24. 470 advocacy planning. Charney's contribution was a panorama of both sides of a block on St Laurent Boulevard - the traditional fault line between Francophone and Anglophone - reminiscent of Ed Ruscha's record of the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles. Photo graphers captured graffiti The cry from the streets was clear. The streets had, for an instant, been charged in a very different way. On October 15, 1970, Pierre Elliot Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada, enacted the War Measures Act in response to the kidnapping of James Cross, the British trade commissioner, and Pierre Laporte, the Quebec minister of labour and immigration, by two independent cells of the Front de Lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec (FLQ), a group of self -professed revolutionaries inspired by anti-colonial struggles (whether the Algerian war of independence or Che Guevara) and dedicated to Quebec ind\u00e9pendance . Since 1963, the FLQ had undertaken a bombing campaign against apparent symbols of Anglophone or capitalist authority. 141 Now, Montreal was filled with soldiers and curfew imposed. Laporte would be executed and his body found in a car abandoned on the outskirts of Montreal; an FLQ communiqu\u00e9 a nnouncing his murder derisively called him the \"minister of unemployment and assimilation\" . On December 3, Cross was freed in exchange for the safe passage of his kidnappers to Cuba. His 141 The FLQ was responsible for at least 170 violent incidents, including bombings, which killed eight people and injured many more. FLQ violence typically targeted property rather than people. Nevertheless, the bombing of the Montreal Stock Exchange on February 13, 1969, left 27 people wounded. The total FLQ members involved in violence was around 100; a smaller number were active in editorial and propaganda work, while a few hundred more were ready t o offer concealment and financial aid; a few thousand lent \"armchair\" support. See: Judy Torrance, Public Violence in Canada (Montreal and Kingston ON: McGill -Queen's University Press, 1986), 36ff. 471 release took place on \u00cele Notre-Dame in the former Canadian pavilion, temporarily declared Cuban territory. Here, at the base of Katimavik, under \"an improbable huddle of white roofs clustered together like fallen paper airplanes\", the fairgrounds of Man and His World - \"a manmade island, remote from normal pursuits, impregnable to casual violence\" - briefly became, once again, the focus of worldwide attention. 142 Yet the internationalism of a distant world's fair now yielded to the s\u00e9paratisme of revolutionaries calling themselves the \"n\u00e8gres blancs d'Am\u00e9rique\". The sit e could not have been better chosen: an island in the middle of the St Lawrence River, a part of Montreal but decidedly apart from it, perhaps always apart from it even during the heady days of Expo 67. 142 Brian Moore, The Revolution Script (New York: Holt, Re inhart and Winston, 1971), 248. 472 Bibliography ARCHIVES Fonds Arcop, Canadian Centre for Architeture, Montreal .
