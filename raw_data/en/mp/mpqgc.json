Ms Dingle, 40, was the wife of Murdoch University Professor Peter Dingle, a leading toxicologist, author, self-described media personality and guest presenter on the ABC's Can We Help? program. The inquest into her death is being held to determine what role her homeopath, Francine Scrayen, and husband played in her treatment, and whether greater regulation of alternative medicines is needed. In a letter to Dr Platell, Ms Dingle said she wanted to adopt a \"holistic\" approach to her treatment. This included a strict diet, mineral supplements, and lifestyle and attitude changes. Asked to compare homeopathic medicine to the more traditional medicine, Dr Platell said he did not \"have any experience in those (homeopathic) areas\". When asked to comment on a paper written by Dr Dingle suggesting that surgery and chemotherapy were ineffective in treating cancer, Dr Platell replied: \"I completely disagree with Dr Dingle's statement\". Dr Platell said he became \"anxious\" after Ms Dingle kept putting off surgery after being diagnosed with bowel cancer in early 2003. \"I was getting a little bit nervous about the length of time she was taking to have surgery,\" Dr Platell said. Although she eventually did have the tumour removed after suffering an acute bowel blockage, Ms Dingle died of her disease two years later. Dr Platell said she would have had a \"good chance of survival\" had she elected to have surgery soon after she was diagnosed. \"I felt surgery would have been the best option,\" he said. \"It's a terminal illness. If left untreated, the patient will eventually die.\" Dr Platell said there was a 96 per cent chance of five-year survival if colourectal cancer was diagnosed in the early stages, or stage one of the disease. This dropped to 83 per cent for stage two and 77 per cent for stage three, which was \"about where\" Ms Dingle was when she was first diagnosed. The odds of surviving stage four cancer for five years or more were still 18 per cent, Dr Platell said. \"She was the first patient I had ever had who had refused surgery,\" he said, referring to the 494 colourectal cancer patients he had treated up to 2007. The inquest continues before West Australian Coroner Alastair Hope. "}
