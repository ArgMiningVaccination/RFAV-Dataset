But theprudent and unostenta\u00ac tious, though invaluable labours ofMr. Morrison, won their esteem and admiration, and ledthem to treat him with great confidence. He now gave himself with renewed enthusiasm to thepreparation ofthe Anglo-Chinese Dictionary_a formidable undertaking, which involved anacquaint\u00ac ance with Chinese classical literature such as no Englishman orEuropean had ever possessed. Three copies of his translation oftheActs ofthe Apostles, which heforwarded toEngland, aroused the deepest interest intheminds ofthe lovers of missions. The Directors ofthe London Missionary Society presented one copy totheBritish andForeign Bible Society, which liberally voted \u00a3500 towards the printing ofthe whole Bible inChinese, when the translation should becomplete another copy was unstitched, and itsleaves distributed amongst empire, and they re\u00ac joiced accordingly.

Mr. Morrison was a missionary first and essentially he was aservant ofthe East India Company foritsconveni\u00ac ence and his own. Afew days later hewent to Canton, where hefound Mr. Milne well, busily engaged with hisstudies, butinvery uncom\u00ac fortable quarters. Thence he returned toMacao and on September 80th, again arrived at Canton, having just finished the translation oftheNew Testament in Chinese. He now devoted himself increasingly to the Anglo-Chinese Dictionary, which severely taxed his powers and resources. In the midst of these labours, hisposition was rendered the more trying by the death ofMr. Roberts, the chief ofthe English Factory, who had proved awarm friend to him since his arrival in China.

K5 Seng-sang and his son were therefore dismissed and sent to aplace ofsafety. But, onthe other hand, the New Testament was printed and ready forcirculation, sothat there was theprospect ofgood being done through its finding away into the homes ofmany ofthepeople. Two thousand copies were first printed, which were taken from wooden blocks. From these blocks one hundred thousand copies might have been printed without material damage being done tothem. Mr. Morrison also issued simultaneously ten thousand copies ofatract containing anoutline oftheChristian system, andfivethousand copies ofaCatechism. Itwas soon found that Mr. Milne would not be permitted toremain atCanton, and that hemust look out for aresidence elsewhere. The earnest attention ofboth missionaries was directed tothe finding of aplace which might beconsidered the head-quarters oftheMission, where means could be taken forextending thework, and which might be, ifneedful, aresting-place for the agents ofthe Society indeclining years. Itwastherefore settled that Mr. Milne should gothrough the chief Chinese settlements inthe Malay Archipelago with the fol\u00ac lowing objects inview: first, tocirculate the New Original from and digitized by National University of Singapore by National University of Singapore Libraries72 ROBERT MORRISON. have two sets ofblocks, tobekept indifferent places, sothat ifone fellinto the hands ofopponents might were therefore prepared, atacost offivehundred Spanish dollars,1 besides half-a-dollar each copy forprinting off.

The expenses incurred already ingathering up materials foritscomposition had been very great, and the cost ofitspublication was alike beyond the means ofthe author and oftheMissionary Society. Itwas, therefore, with thankfulness and asense of gracious relief that Mr.Morrison, after much nego\u00ac tiation, obtained from the Company apromise to print itatitsexpense. Atonce theSelect Committee made arrangements, and shortly afterwards Mr. P.

This was alarge programme. How much of itMr. Morrison and hisfaithful coadjutor were able tocarry out, weshall seehereafter. The year 1814 brought toMr.Morrison what was the greatest joy hehad hitherto experienced inhis arduous work. For seven years hehad hoped, prayed, scattered the seed ofthekingdom, yearning thatit might good ground andbear fruit buttime But atlength hewastoberefreshed byhaving one convert tohis prolonged ministry. This was Tsae-Ako, one of his early teachers, and brother ofA-Heen, still employed byhim, who now made application for baptism, giving thefollowing confession offaith :\u2014 \"Jesus making atonement for usistheblessed sound.

When his duties required hispresence inCanton, he took his son with him, leaving hisdaughter inthe care ofhiskind friends, Dr. and Mrs. Livingstone atMacao, intending tosend both children toEngland as soon as aconvenient occurred. His skill and tact asaninterpreter anddiplomatist severely tested onhisarrival of afracas which broke out between theEnglish and Chinese authorities. Some men from anEnglish frigate had gone ashore atthe island ofLintin, adjacent tothe Chinese coast, for the purpose ofobtaining water. Although they were unarmed, aparty ofChinese attacked them, and several were wounded. Acompany was sent from the ship todefend them, and inthe struggle two Chinamen were killed. The local government de\u00ac manded that the murderers, asthey were called, should begiven up,tobeexecuted according tolaw. The English denied that there was any murder in the case, and refused the demand. Both parties firmly maintained their ground, and asaresult trade was interfered with, therelations ofthe two nations were strained, theEnglish Factory atCanton was- closed, itsemployes andstock were put onboard ship and anunfriendly attitude was taken up. Some of the Chinese merchants deeply regretted the affair and didtheir best toend the unfortunate quarrel by seeking toinduce theEnglish toaccommodate matters somewhat. They even suggested totheofficers ofthe frigate that they should saythat twooftheir men had fallen overboard, and that, asthese were the murderers, they could notbegiven up.
