Type I diseases are incident in both rich and poor countries, with large numbers of vulnerable population in each. Examples of communic able diseases include measles, hepatitis B, and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib ), and of non-communicable diseases (e.g. diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, a nd tobacco-related illnesses). Many vaccines for Type 1 diseases have been develop ed in the past 20 years, but have not been widely introduced into the poor count ries because of cost. Type II diseases are incident in both rich and poor countries, but w ith a substantial proportion of the cases in the poor countries. HIV /AIDS and tuberculosis are examples: both diseases are present in both rich an d poor countries, but more than 90 percent of cases are in poor countries. Type III diseases are those that are overwhelmingly or exclusively i ncident in developing countries, such as African sleeping sick ness (trypanosomiasis) and African river blindness (onchocerciasis). Such dise ases receive extremely little R&D, and essentially no commercially based R&D in rich c ountries. When new technologies are developed, they are usually serendipitous, as w hen a veterinary medicine developed by Merck (ivermectin) proved to be effect ive in control of onchocerciasis in humans. Type II diseases are often termed neglected diseases and Ty pe III diseases very neglected diseases. WHO (2006) op. cit., p13 40. WHO (2006) op. cit., p.85. 41.

In the European Union, pricing and reimburseme nt of pharmaceuticals is primarily a national competence, and, as a result, 27 different pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement systems are in place in the enlarged European Union. There is a strong connection between pricing and reimbursement at EU level. In many EU countries price controls are only applicable to rei mbursable medicines. The most common price control policy is statutory pricing, w here authorities set the price on a regulatory, unilateral basis. In a few countries ph armaceutical prices are negotiated between the manufacturer (or wholesaler) and the go vernment authority. UK has no direct price control, but the prices of NHS pharmac euticals are indirectly controlled via a profit control scheme. Twenty-two PPRI countries apply external price referencing (international price benchmarking). Another common pricing procedure is with equivalent or similar products within the same coun try (internal price referencing). OBIG (2008), op. cit., p XIII-XVI. 48. Executive Summary p 8, Final Report pp 81-94. The Commission noted that on entry to the market, generic versions are 25 percent less expensive than originator versions. After two years in the market, generic me dicines are cheaper on average by 40 per cent, due to competition. These savings tran slate across to the health system: average savings are estimated to be almost 20 perce nt after the first year, and 25 percent after the second year. The main emphasis in the inquiry dealt with a sample of ~219 medicines set to expire between 2000 and 20 07. These medicines represent 47 percent of overall turnover of prescription medi cines: EU (2007) (P150-2 of Final Report, p4 of Executive Summary and; 'Antitrust: sh ortcomings in pharmaceutical sector require further action - frequently asked qu estions', available at http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?refer ence=MEMO/09/321&format=DO C&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en) 49.

Fact Sheet: IMI Joint Undertaking. 51. An 'innovative' medicine may be considered inn ovative from a commercial point of view because it will sell and enjoys patent protect ion. From a medicinal or public health perspective, however, a product might not be innovative at all, because it adds little therapeutic value when compared with similar existing medicines. According to the US Food and Drug Administration (F DA), 487 new products received market authorisations in the USA between 1998 and 2 003, of which 78% where by and large similar to previously authorised medicine s. Only 14% displayed a marked therapeutic improvement. (FDA Report, quoted in Neu e Z?richer Zeitung, 14/15 May 2005). For example, most new cancer drugs generate large revenues at high prices, but have not proved to be clinically superior to ex isting ones.

Data exclusivity creates a new system of monop oly power, separate from patents, by blocking the registration and marketing approval of generic medicines for five or more years, even when no patent exists. Drug regulatory authorities are prevented from using the clinical trial data developed by the orig inator company to establish the safety and efficacy of a medicine in order to appro ve the marketing of a generic medicine that has already been shown to be equivale nt to the original one. This delays or prevents generic competition. The TRIPS A greement protects only 'undisclosed data' to prevent 'unfair commercial us e'. It does not confer either exclusive rights or a period of marketing monopoly. Data exclusivity prohibits generic competition for a specified period of time. The alt ernative would be for generic manufacturers to repeat clinical trials of drugs to prove their safety and efficacy. However, giving placebos when the safety and clinic al validity of the medicine being tested is already established is unethical. 62. Xavier Seuba (2009) op. cit., pp 48-50. 63.

The impacts presented in this study are calcul ated based on the 'Guide for estimating the impact of changes in intellectual property righ ts (IPR) on access to drugs' 4, prepared by the World Health Organisation and the P an American Health Organisation - WHO/PAHO. This guide describes the I PRIA (Intellectual property rights impact assessment) model. The IPRIA has been applied in different contexts to various countries, and the most recent applications have been carried out within the framework of a consortium of organizations includin g the WHO, the PAHO, the World 38 Bank Institute and the International Centre for Tra de and Sustainable Development (ICTSD), who have refined the methodology. Some of the applications carried out are: Colombia (2005, 2006, 2007), Guatemala (2005), Costa Rica (2005), Bolivia (2006), Costa Rica (2008), Dominican Republic (2008 ), Uruguay and Argentina.

CAN-EU ALLIANCE for Access to Medicines is a c oalition that started in 2008 during the negotiations of the Association Agreement betwe en the Andean Community and the European Union.

NGOs included are: AISLAC, Mision Salud, St ichting, RED CAN EU, MSF, and Farmamundi. 70. The role of technology in development follows a fairly standard path, described by one UN report as 'a developed, innovating \"North\" a nd a developing, imitating \"South\"'. All countries initially grow by imitating and adapting existing technologies. As they approach the global 'technological frontier', they move into innovation. One of the reasons why countries such as China or India, t hat are in 'catch-up' mode, grow so much faster than the industrialised countries is that adapting existing technologies is much easier than creating new ones. 71. Historically, IP legislation has followed deve lopment: as countries have grown richer, and as they evolve from imitation to innovation, th ey have introduced more stringent IP laws. Chemical substances remained un-patentable until 1967 in West Germany, 1968 in the Nordic countries, 1976 in Japan, 1978 i n Switzerland, and 1992 in Spain (by which time, their chemical industries had estab lished themselves). This pattern was broken over the past twenty years by a combinat ion of new institutions such as the WTO and regional trade agreements, and an extra ordinarily aggressive campaign by large corporations and their home-country govern ments. 72.

The WHO states that 'counterfeiting can apply to both branded and generic products and counterfeit products may include products with the correct ingredients or with the wrong ingredients, without active ingredients, with insufficient active ingredients or with fake packaging.', see www.who.int/impact 82. Importantly, for the WHO, counterfeit medicine s are part of the broader phenomenon of substandard pharmaceuticals. Substandard pharmac euticals are products whose 39 composition and ingredients do not meet the correct scientific specifications and which may be either ineffective or dangerous to the patient. It is therefore a public health problem that has a limited relationship with trademark law and a very marginal relationship with patent law. As it has been demons trated elsewhere, only one percent of 'counterfeits' are exact copies of origi nal products and could, in consequence, and assuming that the original product was patented, imply a patent infringement. The rest of cases involve trademark v iolations and much more importantly, quality shortcomings. This is reason w hy it must be stressed that originator companies and some developed countries h ave misplaced intellectual property at the centre of the debate.'

This includes strong public support from the Br itish and French governments, including financial disbursements, to implement a UNITAID pat ent pool for HIV and AIDS medicines. The Dutch ministry of development tradit ionally has access to medicines as a priority policy. 40 98. On July 12th, 2007 there was a European Parliam ent resolution on the TRIPS Agreement and access to medicines (P6_TA(2007)0353) , urging the EC not to demand for TRIPS plus provisions. The following recommendations were given to the EC by the EP in 2008 in the context of the negotiations with the Andean communi ty: i)Using negotiating guidelines on development cooperation designed to achieve MDGS , including the protection of public health, ii) ensuring coherence of developmen t policies in line with the principle enshrined in Article 178 of the EC Treaty, iii) gra nting high priority for greater access to education and health, iv) fostering regional int egration by negotiating block by block , see X. Seuba, (2009) 'Protection Health in the EU Andean trade agreement', Hai paper series. These recommendations are in conflict with the EC's stand on limiting TRIPS flexibilities and the one-sided perspective of IPR holders. Furthermore, the EC has engaged in bilateral agreements, excluding some of the Andean countries, as happened in the ACP countries.

Antibiotic resistance is an increasingly seriou s problem, and has been identified as a priority by the Swedish presidency. Antibiotic resistance poses many challenges, including the treatment of Tuberculosis (TB). One o f the most pressing challenges is stimulating new TB diagnostics and medicines.

MSF has recently proposed a prize fund for TB diagn ostics; the EC should be open to explore this alternative funding mechanisms for R&D . See P.
