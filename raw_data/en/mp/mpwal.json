Germ MD EZ-Swallow Rapid-Tabs and Germ MD Effervescent Tablets prevent or reduce infection from cold and flu germs and the incidence of colds or flu; and c. Scientific evidence demonstrates that Germ MD EZ-Swallow Rapid-Tabs and Germ MD Effervescent Tablets prevent or reduce infection from germs and the incidence of colds or flu. 26. Through the means described in Paragraph 18, including, but not limited to, the statements and depictions contained in the advertisements attached as Exhibits R through V, Defendants have represented, expressly or by implication, that: a. Allergy MD provides fast and long-lasting relief from seasonal and environmental allergies, including those caused by grasses and plants23whose pollen is spread by the wind; and b. Allergy MD is clinically proven to provide relief from seasonal and environmental allergies. 27. Through the means described in Paragraph 19, including, but not limited to, the statements and depictions contained in the advertisements attached as Exhibits W and X, Defendants have represented, expressly or by implication, that: a. Allergy MD Rapid-Tabs provide relief from hay fever and all-season and environmental allergies, including symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, itchy and watery eyes, and nasal congestion; and b. Allergy MD Rapid-Tabs is a homeopathic product. 28. The representations set forth in Paragraphs 24 through 27 are false or were not substantiated at the time the representations were made. Therefore, the making of the representations in Paragraphs 24 through 27 constitutes a deceptive practice and the making of false advertisements, in or affecting commerce, in violation of Sections 5(a) and 12 of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 45(a) and 52. CONSUMER INJURY 29. Consumers have suffered and will continue to suffer substantial injury as a result of Defendants' violations of the FTC Act. In addition, Defendants have been unjustly enriched as a result of their unlawful acts or practices. Absent injunctive relief by this Court, Defendants are likely to continue to injure consumers, reap unjust enrichment, and harm the public interest. THIS COURT'S POWER TO GRANT RELIEF 30. Section 13(b) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 53(b), empowers this Court to grant injunctive and such other relief as the Court may deem appropriate to halt and redress violations24of any provision of law enforced by the FTC Act. The Court, in the exercise of its equitable jurisdiction, may award other ancillary relief, including rescission or reformation of contracts, restitution, the refund of monies paid, and the disgorgement of ill-gotten monies, to prevent and remedy any violation of any provision of law enforced by the FTC. PRAYER FOR RELIEF Wherefore, Plaintiff FTC, pursuant to Section 13(b) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 53(b), and the Court's own equitable powers, requests that the Court: (a) Enter a permanent injunction to prevent future violations of the FTC Act by Defendants; (b) Award such relief as the Court finds necessary to redress injury to consumers resulting from Defendants' violations of the FTC Act, including, but not limited to, rescission or reformation of contracts, restitution, the refund of monies paid, and the disgorgement of ill-gotten monies; and25 (c) Award Plaintiff the costs of bringing this action, as well as such other and additional relief as the Court may determine to be just and proper.
