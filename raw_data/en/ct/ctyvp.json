Artigo em Ingl\u00eas | Scopus | ID: covidwho-2241994 ABSTRACTThe wake of the COVID-19 pandemic has yet again highlighted how vital [immunization]is for [public health]. Despite the dramatic spread of [SARS-CoV-2]and its variants, there is a rising trend of people refusing to be vaccinated. As a result, [governments]and [health]experts must gather and understand public ideas and [perceptions]about [vaccines]to design engagement and [education]efforts about [vaccine]advantages. [Sentiment analysis]is common [method]for acquiring a broad picture of [public opinion], that enables the [classification]of people as those [who]are in favor or against [vaccination], as well as the [determination]of the factors that influence their [attitudes]and [beliefs]. The purpose of this chapter is to describe the general approach to [sentiment analysis]in the context of [vaccinations]and [review]its different use cases. The chapter's experimental component integrates the utilization of a [dataset]retrieved from Kaggle, which contains [COVID-19 vaccine]-related Twitter data. When attempting to perform [sentiment analysis], certain methodological steps need to be considered after [data collection], including data pre-processing, [technique]selection and model [construction], as well as model evaluation and results interpretation. Both supervised and unsupervised [sentiment analysis] [methods]are investigated in the model [construction]step, with the former involving the implementation of [Support Vector Machines]and [Logistic Regression] [algorithms], and the latter Valence Aware [Dictionary]and [sEntiment]Reasoner (VADER) [sentiment analysis]tools. The performance of each [algorithm]and tool is evaluated, as is the performance of each [sentiment] [detection]approach in order to select the best performing one. [Social media]platforms have become a common [source of information]and [misinformation]regarding [vaccines]. Our effort aims to emphasize the importance of [mining]such readily available public [attitudes], as well as forecast [opinions]and reactions related to [vaccine]uptake in near real- [time]. Such insights could be critical in dealing with [health] [emergency]situations like the ongoing [coronavirus] [pandemic]. documento: Artigo Similares MEDLINE ... LILACS LIS "}
