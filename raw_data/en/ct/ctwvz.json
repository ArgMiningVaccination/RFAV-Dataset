Now, unlike virtually any other former Waldorf insider, he has told the truth about the strange world he inhabited in those days. He has published an excellent memoir of his years as a Waldorf student and, later, teacher. The original is available, in French, as his blog: \"Ma vie chez les anthroposophes\". Perra encountered Waldorf education and Anthroposophy in France, which might lead us to suppose that his experiences are unique to that country. But Waldorf schools \u2014 also called Steiner or Steiner-Waldorf schools \u2014 are much the same everywhere. And Anthroposophy is an essentially unchanging body of mystical belief.

Ramon De Jonghe (in Belgium) is familiar with Rudolf Steiners anthroposophy. Since 1993 he has been reading a lot of Steiner, purely out of interest. He worked as an educator in a Steiner school, was in the board of directors of that school, worked as a volunteer in the library of the Rudolf Steiner Academie, studied at an anthroposophical college, and 3 of his 4 children went to two different Steiner schools. One can say that when he comes to speak of Steiner schools and anthroposophy, it is out of his own experience as an insider.

Waldorf Schools in the Third Reich](http://www.academia.edu/2429972/Education_for_the_National_Community_Waldorf_Schools_in_the_Third_Reich)by Peter Staudenmaier In some ways the particulars of anthroposophical doctrines on nation and race stood in the way of a closer convergence with elements of National Socialism rather than facilitating it. This was nonetheless the shared intellectual territory on which the controversy over Waldorf schools was carried out. To the extent that this complex interplay of ideas resulted in conflict rather than congruence between Waldorf education and its Nazi counterparts, it is tempting to reduce the conflict to a basic ideological incompatibility. In an important sense, however, it was the similarities between anthroposophical and National Socialist views of the world which led to their opposition, not the differences. Waldorf versions of the national community constituted a mirror image of Nazi ideals, one which Nazism itself could not abide. [Fairy-tale fallout: rudolf Steiner's educational philosophy has come under scrutiny in a racism row at a New Zealand Steiner school](http://www.listener.co.nz/current-affairs/education/fairy-tale-fallout/) ...two years ago, parents at this Steiner school discovered a darker side to the writings of Rudolf Steiner. They found what Perkins now considers to be \"evil, evil white racism\". Over an extraordinary few months, parents and staff left the school in droves. The school has no clear record of numbers. But those we talked to say the racism - and the way the school \"vilified\" those who spoke out against it - drove out six of Te Ra's 35 staff members and more than 29 families. It was a huge hit for the roll, which is now 157. Perkins spent more than five years working at Te Ra and sent her children there. \"We've managed to get ourselves out of something,\" she says. \"It's like being woken up - I felt like Snow White, I really did - I felt like the poisoned apple came out of my mouth and I woke up.\" [\"...out of the frying pan and into the fire\" review (in English) by Peter Staudenmaier Martins has written a perceptive and provocative book about a topic many prefer to avoid: Rudolf Steiner's racial teachings, a perennial bone of contention between anthroposophists and their critics. It is a sober and discerning account, by far the best to appear from an anthroposophist publisher, and a noteworthy contribution to the historical literature on Steiner and his movement. The book's approach is nuanced, complex, and sophisticated, taking heed of the contrasting motifs in Steiner's thinking about nation and race, what Martins aptly terms \"Steiner's wavering between universalism, individualism, cultural chauvinism, and racist stereotypes.\" [Anthroposophical Spiritual Racism: Karutz](articles/Anthroposophical_Spiritual_Racism.htm)by Peter Staudenmaier: How Steiner's racial teachings were carried on in Germany before and during the Nazi era. \"Like Steiner, Karutz portrayed the various racial groups as rungs on the ladder of spiritual progress, with white people at the top. Racial traits, according to Karutz, are both 'physiological features' and 'spiritual facts'; light skin indicates spiritual development and dark skin indicates spiritual debility. Karutz explained that in the ongoing process of racial evolution, the 'lower races' are destined to die out, because 'the so-called natural peoples or primitive peoples that survive today are merely the debased remnants of earlier stages.'\" From the Waldorf Critics discussion list.

The leading protagonist in this unfolding racial drama is the 'Aryan race,' whose members were carefully selected by their cosmically appointed guide. A sharp contrast between racial groups with exceptional biological and spiritual traits, like the specially advanced Aryans, and the large mass of people who do not share these superior traits, runs throughout the text. This fundamental contrast is coupled with the distinction between racial and ethnic groups that 'lead' and those that 'follow' and the divergence between 'more advanced' groups and those that have failed to evolve.\" From the Waldorf Critics discussion list.

However, an equally interesting and quite new cultural phenomenon, at least in Britain, is the increasing challenge being mounted to what some see as an overbearingly stifling \"political correctness\" on questions of race. From the rebuttal by Peter Staudenmaier: Scholars have studied racism for a very long time, since decades before the notion of 'political correctness' was invented. Whether or not Steiner's various statements about race are 'politically correct' has nothing whatsoever to do with whether those statements are racist. Like other anthroposophists, House appears entirely unaware of the extremely large body of scholarship examining racism in its multifarious forms. [Steiner Waldorf Schools Part 3. The problem of racism](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3853)279 Comments [Illusion of Coexistence: The Waldorf Schools in the Third Reich, 1933-1941, by Karen Priestman, Wilfrid Laurier University, 2009](http://scholars.wlu.ca/etd/1080/)- Waldorf school teachers and administrators (as well as most parents) failed to grasp the true ideological and political nature of National Socialism. In their attempt to cooperate with the regime's Gleichschaltung policies they were misled by its ideas of national renewal and Volksgemeinschaft, and its polycratic character of administration - and, thus, fell victim to the illusion of coexistence in a nazified 'new Germany.' (10) This belief represented a fundamental misunderstanding of the true nature of National Socialism. It informed and determined all the choices the school leadership made in the Third Reich. Thus, while their level of cooperation increased over time as more extensive demands were made of them, this cannot be equated with collaboration. On the contrary, theirs was a policy of cooperation that allowed for a certain degree of accommodation to ensure survival. In this pursuit of coexistence, the schools were not motivated by an inherent affinity with National Socialism, as some have argued, but by their determination to continue to teach the lessons of Rudolf Steiner.\" (23-24) For Peter Staudenmaier's comments on the dissertation, see: http://www.academia.edu/2429972/Education_for_the_National_Community_Waldorf_Schools_in_the_Third_Reich [Steiner & Krishnamurti](articles/Krishnamurti.html)by Peter Staudenmaier.

Church-State Issues with Public Waldorf Schools [Schools as Churches:](https://sites.google.com/site/waldorfwatch/schools-as-churches)Drawing almost exclusively from books in the \"Foundations of Waldorf Education\" series (Anthroposophical Press), I have pulled together list of statements by Rudolf Steiner indicating the religious nature of Waldorf education. I think that, for most readers, the list should prove conclusive: Steiner meant Waldorf to be religious, and thus to the degree that Waldorf teachers attend to Steiner's expressed intentions, Waldorf schools today are religious institutions. [Concerns about the state funding of Steiner schools: British Humanist Association](https://humanism.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/BHA-BRIEFING-concerns-about-the-state-funding-of-Steiner-schools.pdf)- The BHA has a large number of varied concerns about the state funding of Steiner schools. ... These concerns range from the quality of education provided, to pseudoscience on the curriculum, to homeopathy being given to pupils (which is unique), and at least one of the schools opting out of providing vaccinations (which is extremely unusual). The place of anthroposophy in the schools is consistently misunderstood. The human rights implications of state funded Steiner schools have not been properly considered. [Medford school doesn't recite Pledge of Allegiance, but bill would require it, flag in classroom: Oregon Legislature today](http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/04/director_of_medford_school_tha.html)- The director of a public charter school in Medford has defended the school's practice of not reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, saying that it has nothing to do with lack of patriotism. The Waldorf-based school believes children should understand the pledges they make, before they make them, said Joseph Frodsham, director of the Madrone Trail Public Charter School. [Defamation Trial of Gregoire Perra (preliminary translation):](http://thewaldorfreview.blogspot.se/2013/04/the-trial-of-gregoire-perra.html)Gregoire Perra published an article critical of Waldorf education on the web site of UNADFI, a French anti-cult organization.

A trial was held in Paris April 5, 2013. Linked here is a rough translation of Perra's notes on the trial, followed by the French original text. [Tory Free Schools Plot to Spin Away the Racism of Steiner Schools:](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2013/01/tory-free-schools-plot-to-spin-away-the-racism-of-steiner-schools.html)Last year, I wrote to my local MP, Lib Dem Tessa Munt, to raise concerns that the nearby opening of a state funded Steiner School raised a number of issues. Most importantly, that Steiner Schools are not open about the religious and occult nature of their philosophy and that this philosophy is based on an abhorrent racist view of human spirituality. Furthermore, children are likely to be exposed to pseudoscience, hidden spiritual agendas and nonsensical teaching philosophies.
