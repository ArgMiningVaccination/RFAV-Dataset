It is based on the National Vaccine Storage and Handling Guideline for Immunization Providers 2007 (PHAC), and is designed to increase immunization provider awareness, understanding and compliance of appropriate storage and handling requirements. Procedures have been established in order to protect the potency and effectiveness of vaccines and biologics. The Appendices, Resources and Worksheets enclosed at the end of the Protocol are to provide assistance to immunization providers to operationalize the cold chain monitoring of vaccines and biologics. 1.1.What is Cold Chain? \"Cold Chain\" refers to the process used to maintain optimal conditions during the transport, storage, and handling of vaccines and biologics, starting at the manufacturer and ending with the administration to the patient or client. There are three basic elements needed to ensure that vaccines and biologics are handled properly: 1. Well trained staff 2. The right equipment 3. Standard operating procedures or guidelines Storage issues can occur as a result of malfunctioning equipment or human error. Vaccines and biologics are sensitive. Their potency and effectiveness may be negatively impacted if they are exposed to: freezing temperatures heat direct sunlight or fluorescent lightProducts that have been improperly stored and/ or handled can permanently lose their potency. 2.Cold Chain Responsibilities Relevant Reference Materials: Worksheet 1: Checklist for Storage of Vaccines and Biologics Worksheet 2: Provider or Personnel Agreement Form Worksheet 3: Vaccines and Biologics Storage Tasks - Roles and Responsibilities Worksheet 4: Routine and Emergency Contact List People: The Key Ingredient Proper storage and handling of vaccines and biologics depends on the knowledge and practices of the staff in the health care setting. 2.1.Identification of Responsibility Each health care setting should designate one (1) staff member as the \"Vaccine Coordinator\" and another one (1) staff member as \"back up\". The Vaccine Coordinator or backup will be responsible for: Monitoring cold chain practices. Ensuring all vaccines and biologics are handled correctly and procedures are documented (Worksheet 1: Checklist for Storage of Vaccines and Biologics , page 35). Ensuring that all appropriate staff receive training and annual refresher sessions on cold chain practices. The training for all staff members who may be involved with handling vaccines and biologics should include (Worksheet 2: Provider or Personnel Agreement Form , page 36):Communicable Disease Management Protocol August 2013 3Cold Chain Protocol -Vaccines and Biologics What to do when deliveries of vaccines and biologics arrive Correct storage temperatures and handling conditions How to read and document temperatures Where the temperature records are located What to do when there is a cold chain failure, including who to notify and the appropriate documentation 2.2.Assigning Duties and Tasks to Personnel All tasks related to the cold chain of vaccines and biologics should be assigned to specific staff members. The Vaccine Coordinator and the supervisor/manager should identify a division of responsibilities that works for their specific health care setting (Worksheet 3: Vaccines and Biologics Storage Tasks - Roles and Responsibilities , page 37). 2.3.Contact Lists Every health care setting should have a contact list for routine and emergency storage and handling issues. The list should be reviewed annually and updated when there is a change in staff, resources or suppliers (Worksheet 4: Routine and Emergency Contact List , page 38). 3.Management and Accountability Relevant Reference Materials: Resource 7: Immunization Input Form for Facilities and Clinics 3.1.Accountability of Vaccines and Biologics One of the most important steps in the management of vaccines and biologics is accountability for all the publicly-funded products ordered and received from Manitoba Health. Every dose administered should be entered into the Manitoba Immunization Monitoring System (MIMS) to be applied to the patient's immunization record by: -Physician billing (doses automatically entered into MIMS monthly), or-Sending completed MIMS Immunization Input Form for Facilities and Clinics (Resource 7, page 33) or other data entry forms as deemed appropriate to a MIMS Update site for manual data entry (Contact your local public health office to find out where the nearest update site is). Mark the date of first withdrawal on Multi-Dose Vials (MDV). Note:All unused (still in cold chain) and wasted doses must also be accounted for. 3.2.Inventory Management Designated personnel should be responsible for: Monthly physical inventories Regular stock rotations to ensure that products with the soonest expiration dates are used first and kept in front of same product with longer expiry dates. Using product before it expires. Ensuring that no more than one month's supply of stock is on hand to reduce wastage. Separating Manitoba Health publicly- funded product from privately purchased product. Referring to the product monographs for how long MDV are viable after first puncture. 3.3.Expired or Unusable Products Expired product can be removed from the refrigerator and stored in a container marked \"Expired -Do Not Use \". Expired or unusable products previously received by Manitoba Health can be returned to the Provincial Vaccine Warehouse for potential cost recovery or destruction. To find out more: Contact the Provincial Vaccine Warehouse for return instructions at: (204) 948-1333 Toll-Free: 855-683-3306 Communicable Disease Management 4Cold Chain Protocol -Vaccines and Biologics 4.Storage Practices for Vaccines and Biologics Relevant Reference Materials: Resource 1: Magnet Vaccine Storage Diagram 4.1.Ordering Vaccines and Biologics from Manitoba Health Before Ordering Product: 1.Develop a trigger system to indicate when inventory is low and re-ordering is required; taking into consideration delivery time. 2.Develop and maintain complete stock records. 3.Verify on hand stock amounts prior to placing an order (to avoid build up of stock). Ordering Product: 1.Order product based on what the health care setting can utilize in one month. 2.Ensure that trained staff will be present to receive delivery. Whenever possible, arrange for delivery when the Vaccine Coordinator or back-up will be present. 3.Use the most current Vaccines and Biologics Order Form located online at: http://www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/cdc/protocol/vaccinebiologics.pdf 4.Indicate in the comments area on the order form if there are any specific time frames or days that are best for the delivery. 5.Alert other personnel of order placed to prevent order duplication. Receiving Orders: 1.The receiver must have appropriate training for receiving and storing vaccines and biologics. Untrained staff are to be advised that they must notify the Vaccine Coordinator or back-up immediately when a delivery has arrived. 2.Ensure that product is promptly placed in the refrigerator 3.Follow all instructions and review all inserts that are included in the deliveries from the Provincial Vaccine Warehouse. 4.2.Placement of Vaccines and Biologics in the Refrigerator Vaccines and biologics should be stored in a refrigerator that can maintain constant temperatures between +2\u00baC and +8\u00baC and the refrigerator should be in a secure location away from unauthorized personnel and public access. Place product in the refrigerator by (Resource 1: Magnetic Vaccine Storage Diagram , page 23): Storing only vaccines and biologics. Storing product only on middle shelves with product expiring first in front. Grouping products using mesh style or open weave plastic baskets, to allow for adequate air flow, that are clearly labelled with product name and a re-order level. No Food or Beverages should be Stored in Refrigeration Units Containing Vaccines and Biologics. 5.Cold Chain Management Equipment Relevant Reference Materials: Appendix 1: Instructions for Refrigerator and Temperature Monitoring Maintenance Appendix 2: Defrosting a Refrigerator/ Freezer Resource 2: Refrigerator/Temperature Monitoring Maintenance Log Communicable Disease Management Protocol August 2013 5Cold Chain Protocol -Vaccines and Biologics Safe Storage of Vaccines and Biologics Requires: Ia refrigerator Ia freezer (for ice packs) Ia calibrated thermometer for each refrigerator Ia thermometer or thermostat for ambient temperature monitoring I\"DO NOT UNPLUG\" notices and \"WARNING\" stickers for circuit boxes IA back up generator, if possible 5.1.Refrigerators for Vaccines and Biologics Refrigerators must be selected carefully and used properly. They must be: able to maintain the required storage temperatures through all seasons; large enough to hold the year's highest monthly inventory, including influenza season; equipped with a calibrated min/max thermometer or data logger; dedicated to storing only vaccines and biologics; and in a secure location away from unauthorized personnel and public access. 5.2.Types of Refrigerators Bar Fridge Units Any style of small, single door (bar style) fridge is not recommended for the storage of vaccines and biologics. This type of fridge is unpredictable and may not maintain temperatures necessary for product stability. Domestic Refrigerators Domestic combination refrigerator and freezer units, though not recommended for storage of vaccines and biologics, are acceptable. Domestic refrigerators are designed for food storage and not for storage of vaccines and biologics. Precautions and fridge modifications are needed (See Modifications to Improve Domestic Fridge Temperature Stability , below). Purpose Built (Commercial) Vaccine Refrigerators A purpose built (commercial) vaccine refrigerator (also referred to as pharmacy, lab-style or laboratory grade refrigerator) is the standard for storing large inventories of vaccines and biologics. The advantage is that they are specifically designed to ensure better temperature regulation. 5.3.Modifications to Improve Domestic Fridge Temperature Stability To ensure stability of the temperature in a domestic-type fridge follow the Magnetic Vaccine Storage Diagram (Resource 1, page 23) and: Ensure no more than 50 percent (50%) of the internal volume is filled with vaccines and biologics. Routinely check the door to ensure that doors are tightly closed. Store full bottles of water or gel packs on empty shelves, on the bottom (or in bottom drawers) and in the door to help maintain stable temperature during frequent door opening or in the event of a power failure. Keep freezer packs in the freezer compartment. Minimize the number of times the door is opened to reduce temperature fluctuations. 5.4.Refrigerator Maintenance Any refrigerator used to store vaccines and biologics needs to have maintenance cleaning and checks following a maintenance schedule. In the event of a refrigerator malfunction immediate steps should be taken to bring it back to working order.Communicable Disease Management Protocol August 2013 6Cold Chain Protocol -Vaccines and Biologics A refrigerator maintenance equipment log should be kept for all refrigerators used for the storage of vaccines and biologics. Details on refrigerator maintenance, servicing and repair can be documented within the log (Resource 2: Refrigerator/Temperature Monitoring Maintenance Log , page 24). Note:For recommendations on appropriate refrigerator maintenance, please see Appendix 1: Instructions for Refrigerator and Temperature Monitoring and Maintenance (page 15) and Appendix 2: Defrosting a Refrigerator/Freezer (page 17). 5.5.Temperature Recording Devices The only temperature recording devices recommended for monitoring refrigerator temperatures for vaccines and biologics are: Continuous Temperature Monitors (Data Loggers): -Stand alone temperature monitors that can record multiple temperatures. -Accompanied by computer software that allows for downloading data. -Provide an accurate picture of minimum and maximum temperatures and the time spent at each temperature. Digital Min/Max Thermometers: -Several types are available on the market. -Each has slightly different operating instructions. -It is important that the installation instruction from the unit manufacturer be followed and monitored.Fluid-filled biosafe liquid thermometers, bi- metal stem thermometers, and household mercury thermometers are NOT recommended for the temperature monitoring of refrigerators containing Vaccines and Biologics. Room temperature can be taken using a standard household thermometer. In settings where continuous temperature monitoring devices are not being used, Manitoba Health recommends the use of calibrated digital min/max thermometers . They show the current temperature and the minimum and maximum temperatures that have been reached since the last time the thermometer was reset. It is important to manually reset the min/max thermometer each time the temperatures are recorded. A limitation to min/max thermometers is that the readings do not indicate when the exposure occurred and the exact length of time of exposure. 5.6.Thermometer Placement In the refrigerator compartment, the thermometer should be placed on the middle shelf adjacent to the vaccines and biologics. A thermometer should be placed in the center of the refrigerator compartment away from the coils, walls, door, floor, and fan, and the temperature probe should be placed in the vaccine box. In the freezer, the thermometer should be placed on a box (or other item) adjacent to the vaccine so that it is in the middle of the compartment, not on the floor of the freezer. If the thermometer indicates a temperature outside the recommended range, remove the product to an appropriate storage unit and check that the thermometer is appropriately situated. Communicable Disease Management Protocol August 2013 7Cold Chain Protocol -Vaccines and Biologics 6.Temperature Monitoring Relevant Reference Materials: Resource 3: Temperature Log for Vaccines and Biologics Resource 4: Storage Trouble Shooting Record 6.1.Temperature Monitoring by Assigned Personnel Regular and accurate temperature monitoring is imperative to ensure that the products have been stored at the manufacturer's recommended storage temperatures. Refrigerators that contain vaccines or biologics must have an appropriate temperature monitoring device. Required Actions for Daily Temperature Monitoring: 1.Take the fridge(s) and room temperature twice daily (including units with continuous temperature monitoring and recording devices), first thing in the morning and again at the end of the business day. 2.If staff do not work on the weekends some options to consider are: a.Train any security that is on site, if available, to conduct the temperatures on non-work days. b.Use a continuous temperature monitoring device (data logger) as it can better indicate the time and length of any exposures. c.Have the refrigerator(s) hooked up to a central alarm system that will go off when temperatures are outside of the set temperatures. Designated staff or security would be required to assess the situation if an alarm goes off and know the steps required to protect the vaccines and biologics. 3.Document temperatures on a temperature log (Resource 3: Temperature Log for Vaccines and Biologics , page 25), including the: Current refrigerator temperature Minimum temperature since last reading Maximum temperature since last reading Room temperature (to establish effect of ambient temperatures on storage) Note: If a temperature reading is missed, the log entry should remain blank. 4.Take immediate action when the temperature in the fridge is outside the recommended range or if there is an equipment or power failure. Actions taken should be recorded (Resource 4: Storage Trouble Shooting Record , page 27). The Vaccine Coordinator or back-up will: 1.Review the Temperature Log for Vaccines and Biologics weekly to ensure proper storage temperatures are being maintained. 2.Review the Temperature Log for Vaccines and Biologics and Vaccine Storage Trouble Shooting Records monthly to note trends in storage temperatures and potential storage issues. 3.Keep the Temperature Log for Vaccines and Biologics and Vaccine Storage Trouble Shooting Records for a period of three (3) years (to monitor historical and seasonal patterns). To help prevent substantial losses of vaccines and biologics, facilities storing large inventories should install continuous monitoring temperature alarm systems with round-the- clock notification to appropriate personnel.Communicable Disease Management Protocol August 2013 8Cold Chain Protocol -Vaccines and Biologics 7.Packing, Storage and Handling for Off-Site Immunization Clinics The following packing recommendations for the transport of vaccines and biologics to off-site clinics are based on research conducted by the BC CDC, the guidance provided by the National Guidelines (2007), the BC CDC Cold Chain Guidelines , and the CDC Atlanta Cold Chain Guidelines . 7.1.Basic Principles An insulated container should be used and temperature monitored (see page 11, Required Actions for Temperature Monitoring at Off-site Clinics ) for frequency of temperature monitoring. Pack enough refrigerated and/or frozen packs to maintain cold chain (the number of packs is dependent on the container size, ambient temperature, volume of product and length of time transporting). During transport in a personal vehicle: -Do not place container in trunk -Avoid placing container in direct sunlight or in line with heater or air conditioner Only pack the quantity of vaccines and biologics that is expected to be used. Only a brief period out of the refrigerator can be tolerated. Ensure stock rotating principles are in place. Stock that has been transported and returned from clinics should be marked and used first. 7.2.Equipment for Transport to Off-Site Clinics Insulated Containers (Coolers) -Hard-sided insulated containers (with insulation of 30mm to 80mm thick) or newer Styrofoam coolers with at least two (2) inch thick walls.-Large enough to store vaccines and biologics, insulating materials, and icepacks during transport. -Tight-fitting lid and strong handles for carrying and/or wheels. Ice Packs -Keep enough ice packs frozen . -Do not place in direct contact with product as product(s) may freeze; place insulating materials and fillers, if required, between ice packs and product. Insulating Materials -Flexible insulating blankets, gel packs, shredded paper, cardboard, bubble wrap, or Styrofoam. -Flexible insulating blankets or gel packs conditioned to fridge temperatures can be used to wrap around the vaccines and biologics during transport. Temperature Monitors -The use of a min/max thermometer or data logger is recommended for monitoring temperature inside the cooler during all off site clinics -The temperature monitor should be placed next to the products and should not come into contact with the frozen packs.Communicable Disease Management Protocol August 2013 9Cold Chain Protocol -Vaccines and Biologics Communicable Disease Management Protocol August 2013 10 Cold Chain Protocol -Vaccines and Biologics 7.3.Packing for Transport The contents of the cooler should be packed as shown in the diagram below: Diagram: Packing a Cooler for Transport to an Off-Site Clinic Adapted from the North Carolina Vaccine Storage and Handling Guide Note:Pack the vaccines and biologics in their original packaging between the layers of insulating material and fill spaces with crumpled paper or other filler to help prevent shifting of contents during transport. Do not remove vials from boxes and do not draw up vaccines or biologics in advance. Insulating materials Filler (prevents shifting of contents) Temperature gauge (min/max or data logger) Vaccine Vaccine Vaccine Vaccine Vaccine Vaccine Vaccine Vaccine Vaccine Vaccine Vaccine Vaccine Frozen Ice Pack Frozen Ice Pack Frozen Ice Pack Frozen Ice Pack Conditioned Insulated Materials - Fridge Temp. Conditioned Insulated Materials - Fridge Temp. Conditioned Insulated Materials - Fridge Temp. Conditioned Insulated Materials - Fridge Temp. 7.4.Maintaining Cold Chain at an Off-Site Clinic The insulated container (cooler) used for transport and clinics replaces the refrigerator. The cooler should be treated in the same way as the refrigerator (i.e., only open the container when needed and monitor and document temperatures at regular intervals) Note:There is no standard definition for a \"long or mass\" immunization clinic. Of coolers studied, when packed following packing guidelines, interior temperatures were acceptable for at least four to six hours under clinic simulations. Required Actions for Temperature Monitoring at Off-site Clinics: 1.Use a min/max thermometer to monitor and record temperatures on a Temperature Log for Vaccines and Biologics (See Section 6: Temperature Monitoring , page 8): Before leaving the office Upon arrival at off-site clinics Every three (3) hours At the end of the clinic Upon return to the office 2.Each immunizer can use a separate small insulated container (cooler) at their workstation for a small quantity of product. Vaccines and biologics should be protected from freezing by placing insulating material between the product and the ice pack(s). 3.Keep the balance of the product in the large insulated container (cooler) used for transport. 4.Streamline workflow and minimize product exposure to temperatures outside of 2-8\u00b0C and mishandling, by designating one staff person to dispatch/re-pack product from the main cooler to workstations and using several small labelled coolers to differentiate products at the work stations. 5.Drawing up should only occur at the clinic site and every attempt should be made to minimize exposure to temperatures outside of 2-8\u00b0C. If drawing up from a multi-dose vial, the vial is to return to the insulated container as quickly as possible to avoid prolonged exposures outside of 2-8\u00b0C. 8.Managing Cold Chain Problems Relevant Reference Materials: Appendix 3: Malfunctioning Refrigerator Trouble Shooting Checklist Appendix 4: Algorithm to Assess Problems in Temperature Readings Appendix 5: Cold Chain Failure Response Diagram Resource 5: Cold Chain Failure Response Form and Procedures Resource 6: DO NOT UNPLUG and WARNING Notices Cold Chain Failures Happen...Regardless of How...Take Action!Communicable Disease Management Protocol August 2013 11 Cold Chain Protocol -Vaccines and Biologics 8.1.What to do when the temperature is below +2\u00b0C or above +8\u00b0C A temperature reading of below +2\u00b0C or above +8\u00b0C means that the vaccines and biologics have been exposed to temperatures outside of the manufacturer's storage recommendation and may have lost potency. This is referred to as a \"cold chain failure.\" If a cold chain failure occurs, the Vaccine Coordinator or back-up should be informed as soon as possible.Communicable Disease Management Protocol August 2013 12 Cold Chain Protocol -Vaccines and Biologics Required Actions by the Vaccine Coordinator or back-up for a Cold Chain Failure (Appendix 5: Cold Chain Failure Response Diagram , page 20): Action 1 Conduct a quick assessment of the situation to determine if the issue can immediately be identified (i.e. power disconnected, fridge door ajar or opened too frequently, temperature probe misplacement, etc.) Put affected product into a separate container (ex. paper bag) marked \"DO NOT USE.\" Place product in a functioning and monitored refrigerator or cooler until clear instructions have been received about next steps. The vaccines and biologics may still be viable. Don't assume the vaccines cannot be salvaged. Action 2 Begin completing the Cold Chain Failure Response Form according to the Procedures for Completing the Cold Chain Failure Response Procedure and Form (Resource 5, page 28) Begin to rectify any large issues as needed to bring the refrigerator into working order. Action 3 Calculate the maximum length of time the stock was possibly exposed to temperatures outside the manufacturer recommended 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C range. If the specific time and temperature details are not available, use the time of the last temperature check as when the refrigerator malfunctioned. Action 4 Review the most current product monographs for stability information outside of 2-8\u00b0C. If required, contact the manufacturers and provide details on the exposure and request direction regarding viability of the product. Indicate the results on the Cold Chain Failure Response Form . Action 5 If deemed useable, clearly identify on the product (e.g. with a sticker) the date of the cold chain failure and the number of hours exposed. Use at the first opportunity. Action 6 Fax completed Cold Chain Failure Response Form to Communicable Disease Control, Manitoba Health at (204) 948-2040. Action 7 Vaccines deemed NOT useable can be removed from the refrigerator and returned to the Provincial Vaccine Warehouse for potential cost recovery and/or destruction. Consult Manitoba Health prior to ordering replacement product or returning product to the Provincial Vaccine Warehouse. After approval for return is given by Manitoba Health contact the Provincial Vaccine Warehouse for return instructions at (204) 948-1333 or Toll Free: 855-683-3306.8.2.Inventory Management of Cold Chain Failures In most circumstances, replacement of stock can occur once the cause of the cold chain failure has been rectified and the Cold Chain Failure Response Form has been completed and faxed to Communicable Disease Control, Manitoba Health. Actions for product exposed to a cold chain failure but deemed useable: 1.Clearly mark on the product (e.g. with a sticker) the date of the cold chain failure and the number of hours exposed. Two or more exposures may require special consideration by the manufacturer if the product can still be used. 2.Use up product exposed to a cold chain failure before using other stock. Actions when product deemed unusable is inadvertently used: 1.Contact the applicable product manufacturer(s) about appropriate actions/next steps and provide them with the following information to help with assessing the situation: name of the product, duration and temperature of exposure, whether multi-dose vials were open at the time of exposure, the number of doses, and the date the dose(s) were administered. any other information requested by the manufacturer.2.People immunized with a vaccine or biologic with questionable potency may need to be tested for serologic evidence of immunity (presence of protective antibody levels) or be re- immunized. The local Medical Officer of Health within the Regional Health or First Nations Authority can be consulted on these matters. Note:On occasion, vaccines or biologics may be required for an immediate situation. If the current supply has potentially been compromised by a cold chain failure, special arrangements can be made by contacting the Provincial Vaccine Warehouse at (204) 948-1333 or Toll-Free (855) 683-3306 during regular working hours to obtain a temporary/one week supply of replacement stock. 8.3.Refrigerator Malfunctions When the refrigerator containing vaccines and biologics is not working it is important to determine if the malfunction can be corrected quickly. Please refer to Appendix 3: Malfunctioning Refrigerator Trouble Shooting Checklist (page 18) and Appendix 4: Algorithm to Assess Problems in Temperature Readings (page 19) for required actions during a refrigerator malfunction. Note:If the malfunction cannot be corrected quickly ( 3 hours) alternative storage for the stock is required as products cannot remain in a non- functioning refrigerator for an extended period of time. Communicable Disease Management Protocol August 2013 13 Cold Chain Protocol -Vaccines and Biologics Communicable Disease Management Protocol August 2013 14 Cold Chain Protocol -Vaccines and Biologics Appendices Appendix 1: Instructions for Refrigerator and Temperature Monitoring Maintenance Appendix 2: Defrosting a Refrigerator/Freezer Appendix 3: Malfunctioning Refrigerator Trouble Shooting Checklist Appendix 4: Algorithm to Assess Problems in Temperature Readings Appendix 5: Cold Chain Failure Response Diagram Appendix 6: Contact Information Weekly/Monthly Maintenance 1.Check for Ice Build Up in Freezer If you have a manual defrost freezer, it is quite normal for ice and frost to accumulate inside the compartment. A thin layer of frost does not affect the cooling performance but a thick layer of frost negatively affects the efficiency of the system. When frost has accumulated to a thickness of 1cm or so, the unit requires defrosting. Quarterly Maintenance 1.Clean Coils and Motor -Dust and dirt build up affects the transfer of heat from the coils and, therefore, the efficiency of the unit. Unplug the unit and use a soft brush, cloth, or vacuum cleaner with an attachment hose to remove any dirt or dust from the surface of the coils. After cleaning, plug in the unit and document that the power is restored and that the temperature has been maintained. Avoid cleaning the coils and motor at the end of a working week. Accidentally damaging the coils will cause a problem that may not be detected until the following working day. This process should only take a few minutes; therefore, it is not necessary to transfer the product to another storage unit as long as the doors remain tightly closed for the duration of the procedure.2.Clean Inside of Fridge and Freezer -quarterly or as needed. Remove the vaccines and biologics from the compartments and store them in a functioning unit. Unplug the unit or turn off the power and wash all inside surfaces and shelves with warm, slightly soapy water. Dry thoroughly then plug in the unit or turn the thermostat back to an appropriately cold setting. Wait for the unit to stabilize at the proper temperature range monitoring and recording the temperature every half-hour for the next few hours. Restock each compartment with the vaccines and biologics, continuing to monitor and record the temperature every half-hour for the next few hours. 3.Door Seal -check the integrity of the door seals. The door seals should not be torn or brittle and there should be no gaps between the seals and the body of the unit when the doors are closed. The doors should open and close properly and fit squarely against the body of the refrigerator. For this to happen, the hinges must be correctly adjusted. If there are any problems with the door seals, consult a technician as necessary and monitor temperatures carefully.Communicable Disease Management Protocol August 2013 15 Cold Chain Protocol -Vaccines and Biologics Appendix 1: Instructions for Refrigerator and Temperature Monitoring Maintenance Annual Maintenance 1.Thermometer Check -Thermometers and other temperatures recorders must be checked annually to ensure: Temperature measurement is accurate via a Slush Test. Batteries are maintained and changed regularly as recommended by the manufacturer, keeping in mind warranty requirements. Cables or probes are not damaged. 2.Centralized Alarm System Check -External monitoring services should be tested occasionally (like a fire drill) to ensure the service is able to function properly in the event of an actual cold chain failure.Instructions to Conduct a Slush Test 1.Fill a polystyrene or plastic cup two-thirds (2/3) with cold water. Place cup in the freezer until a fine layer of ice forms on top and a small section of ice forms within the fluid (about two (2) hours). If ice is present, this ensures the mixture is 0\u00b0C. 2.Place the temperature probe in the middle of the cup (do not touch the sides) 3.Observe the temperature after two (2) minutes. Within that time, the temperature should drop to 0\u00b0C. Most thermometers are calibrated to \u00b11\u00b0C or better. If the temperature reading is more than 1\u00b0C above or below 0\u00b0C after two (2) minutes, replace the battery and test again. If temperature is still not within range, contact the thermometer manufacturer for instructions on recalibration or replace the thermometer.Communicable Disease Management Protocol August 2013 16 Cold Chain Protocol -Vaccines and Biologics Frost-free freezers do not need to be manually defrosted. They have regular defrosting cycles three or four times a day when the freezer temperature increases and melts the ice automatically. For freezers in non-frost-free refrigerators: 1.Remove all products from both compartments of the unit and place them into alternate storage unit(s) in accordance with written protocols. 2.Turn off the power and unplug the unit. 3.Remove all frozen packs from the freezer (keep frozen, if possible). 4.Keeping the freezer door open, allow all the frost to melt. 5.Loose ice can be removed by hand; no sharp tools or sharp instruments should be used to remove the ice. 6.A container of warm water (not greater than +50\u00b0C) inside the compartment can reduce defrosting time. 7.Once the frost has melted completely, clean thoroughly and wipe the unit dry. (This is also a good time to clean the refrigerator compartment).8.Connect the power and ensure that the thermostat is turned to an appropriately cold setting. 9.Wait for each compartment of the unit to stabilize at the proper temperature range. 10.Monitor and record the temperature every half hour for the next few hours until stable temperatures between +2.0 and +8.0\u00b0C have been reached in the refrigerator. 11.Vaccines and biologics that require to be stored frozen should be in a freezer that is maintained at -15\u00b0C or colder. 12.Re-stock each compartment with the product. 13.Continue to monitor and record the temperature every half-hour for the next few hours. 14.If defrosting is necessary once a month or more frequently, the door may not be sealing properly, the door may have been opened too frequently, or there may be other mechanical problems with the freezer. Consult a technician and monitor temperatures carefully.Communicable Disease Management Protocol August 2013 17 Cold Chain Protocol -Vaccines and Biologics Appendix 2: Defrosting a Refrigerator/Freezer The following checklist is designed to assist in identifying and trouble shooting issues related to possible refrigerator malfunctions. 1.Refrigerator is too warm or cold Check for the following: IUnit is plugged in, turned on, and the control knob has been set properly. IDoor is closing properly or has been opened too frequently within short time period. ITemperature recording device is properly located. IFreezer compartment is free of thick frost (<1 cm). IGood air circulation inside and outside the unit. IExposed coils and the motor are free from dust. IRoom temperature is appropriate. Action: Call a refrigeration technician to assess equipment, if necessary. 2.Refrigerator is too noisy (or is making an unusual noise) Action: Call a refrigeration technician to assess equipment, if necessary. 3.Refrigerator has stopped working Check for the following: IElectrical cord is undamaged. IUnit is plugged in and turned on. IWall outlet is operative. Action: Appropriate personnel to check fuses and circuit breakers. Call a refrigeration technician to assess the equipment, if necessary.

Adapted from the First Nations Inuit Health Branch, Health Canada and CDC Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit (2005), Resources Section, National Vaccine Storage and Handling Guidelines for Immunization Providers, Appendices. Note:If a simple solution to a cold chain problem is not immediately identified (power disconnected, fridge door ajar, temperature probe misplacement, etc.) move vaccines and biologics to a back-up refrigerator or temporarily store in Styrofoam coolers. Temperature reading is < +2\u00baC 1. Is the thermometer properly placed and working? 2. Is the thermostat set to an appropriate setting? 3. Has the ambient temperature of the room become warmer? 4. Is there good air circulation outside of the refrigerator? 5. Call a trained technician to check the refrigerator. Move the thermometer/probe to the centre of the middle shelf. Change battery, if necessary. Adjust the thermostat to a warmer setting. Recheck the temperature of the refrigerator every half hour until the temperature stabilizes at or around +5\u00baC. Continue to monitor for several more hours. Adjust the temperature of the room so that it is not too warm. A warm room will cause the refrigerator to work harder, producing a cooler environment inside the refrigerator. Ensure the refrigerator is set up according to the recommended clearance requirements and that nothing is impairing the air exchange around the unit. NO YES YES NO YES NO YES NO Temperature reading is > +8\u00baC 1. Is there electrical power to the refrigerator? 2. Is the door closed properly? 3. Is the thermometer properly placed and working? 4. Is the thermostat set to an appropriate setting? 5. Has the ambient temperature of the room become cooler? Check the fuse box then contact the electric or hydro company in your area (if necessary). Check the levelling legs, door seals, door latch and hinges. Call a technician to repair as necessary. Move the thermometer/probe to the centre of the middle shelf. Change battery if necessary. Adjust the thermostat to a colder setting. Recheck the thermometer every half hour until the temperature stabilizes at or around +5\u00baC. Continue to monitor for several more hours. NO NO NO NO 6. Is there good air circulation inside and outside of the unit? 7. Call a trained technician to check the refrigerator. Adjust the temperature of the room so that it is not too cold. A cold room will cause a cool ambient temperature outside and a warm environment inside of the refrigerator. Rearrange vaccine trays to allow air to circulate around the vaccines. Ensure that nothing is impairing the air exchange around the unit.
