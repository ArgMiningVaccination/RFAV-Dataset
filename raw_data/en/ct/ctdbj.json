This is different than traditional insurance that you may have had in the past. Traditional Insurance With traditional insurance you pay an insurance company a monthly premium and if you go to the doctor or hospital the insurance company pays some of the cost. The insurance company decides what's covered and how much you pay out-of-pocket. They also accept financial risk if you have a serious health condition like cancer or a heart attack. Our Self-Funded State Plan Your State Plan coverage is funded by the State of Montana via the employer contribution and by you, as a employee, via your bi-weekly State Plan contribution. The State Plan: Provides coverage in accordance with state and federal law Sets the monthly rates and out-of-pocket costs Carries the liability for all 30,000 members of the State Plan Our Third Party Administrators (TPAs) and Vendors With 30,000 members state-wide, the State Plan needs a little help. That's why we contract with outside companies to process claims and administer State Plan benefits. We also rely on these administrators and vendors for their expertise and cost saving contracts. Our TPAs include: BlueCross BlueShield Montana (BCBSMT) - Medical Benefits VSP Vision Care - Vision Benefits Delta Dental - Dental Benefits Navitus Health Solutions - Prescription Benefits ASIFlex - Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs) We also contract with a few other vendors: Premise Health manages the Montana Health Centers. BCBSMT provides fully insured life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance options, as well as long term disability insurance for active employees ComPsych administers the Employee Assitance Program Bottom Line Because it's your money and taxpayer dollars that fund the State Plan, we all have to work together to be good health care consumers.

Your coverage is effective on your date of hire. Flexible Spending Accounts become effective on a different date, see page 22 for details. Joint Core If you and your spouse both work for the State (as an Employee or Legislator) and have at least one dependent child who needs to be enrolled on the State Plan, you can elect to be Joint Core. Your family shares one family Maximum Out-of-Pocket for medical expenses, one family Maximum Out-of-Pocket for prescription expenses, and your bi- weekly contribution is less. To elect Joint Core, contact HCBD. Late Enrollment If you waive coverage, or do not enroll within 31 days of your date of hire, you may be able to join the State Plan at a later date, but you will only be eligible for State Plan benefits for yourself. You will not be able to add a spouse/domestic partner or dependent child(ren) to the plan or elect optional benefits without a Special Enrollment Period. If you enroll after the first 31 days of your date of hire, the effective date of coverage will be the first of the month following receipt of your request for enrollment. Medical Benefits Employees who enroll in the State Plan must enroll in Medical Benefits. Medical Benefits include : Medical coverage Prescription Drug coverage Basic Vision coverage ($10 copay for an eye exam per member at an in-network provider) Basic Life Insurance ($14,000 of coverage) Optional Benefits Medical coverage for spouse/domestic partner or child(ren) Dental Coverage Vision Hardware coverage Additional life insurance for you and/or your spouse/domestic partner or child(ren) Long-Term Disability (LTD) coverage Accidental Death & Dismemberment (AD&D) coverage Flexible Spending Accounts for medical and/or dependent careEmployee Enrollment For complete details about the State Plan, refer to the Wrap Plan Document (WPD) at benefits.mt.gov/publications .6 Proof of Dependent Eligibility If you want to add a spouse/domestic partner or child(ren) to the State Plan, you must provide proof of eligibility before they are enrolled. See page 29 for details. Once verification is provided, dependent coverage is placed retroactively to the effective date and any retroactive contributions will be withheld from your paycheck. Employer Contribution The State contributes $1,054 per month per eligible employee to the State of Montana Benefit Plan. Paying for Coverage The State of Montana employer contribution may not cover all of your benefit costs. Any extra cost is automatically deducted from your bi- weekly paycheck. You start owing your benefit contribution the day your coverage begins. If you submit your benefit elections within 31 days of your date of hire, but after your first pay period, you will see two pay periods worth of contributions come out of your second or third paycheck. After that, the contributions will be distributed evenly. Tax Information Most of your benefit contribution will be deducted pretax out of your paycheck with the exception of the following: Life Insurance coverage for yourself and your dependents Long Term Disability (LTD) insurance coverage Non-tax dependent coverage (i.e. domestic partner) Benefit Identification Cards You will receive medical, dental, vision, and prescription drug plan identification cards within two to three weeks of completing your enrollment. Open Enrollment You will have the opportunity to make changes to your State Plan options during the annual two-week Open Enrollment Period that takes place each fall. These changes take effect January 1 of the following Plan Year. Be sure to read all mail and email from HCBD for details about Open Enrollment.7 Employees enrolling on the State Plan must self-report their, and their covered spouse/domestic partner's, nicotine use status as part of their Initial Enrollment event. In the event the employee, or their covered spouse/domestic partner, is a Nicotine User, a Tobacco Surcharge will apply. The Tobacco Surcharge is $30 per month per Nicotine User. See the definitions below and note the eligible alternatives included in the defintion of Nicotine Free. Nicotine Nicotine is an addictive stimulant proven to have negative health effects that is found in cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobacco, and most vaping products. Nicotine Free You are nicotine free if you have never used nicotine, have quit using nicotine, use only FDA-approved Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT), or infrequently use nicotine (less than 4x per month). You are nicotine free if you are currently using nicotine but have completed an eligible alternative (nicotine cessation program or a nicotine counseling session with a medical provider) during the past 12 months. Nicotine User You are a nicotine user if you are currently using nicotine and have not completed an eligible alternative (nicotine cessation program or a nicotine counseling session with a medical provider) during the past 12 months. To avoid the $30 per month Tobacco Surcharge you need to annually self-attest your, and if applicable your covered spouse or domestic partner's, nicotine use.
