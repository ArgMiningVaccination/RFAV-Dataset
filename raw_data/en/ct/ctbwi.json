Targeting the root causes of pain and discomfort aids in enhancing physical well-being and fostering the body's inherent healing abilities. Chiropractic care, a field of medicine focusing on the musculoskeletal and nervous systems, originated in the late 19th century. D.D. Palmer, an American magnetic healer, founded the practice in 1895 when he adjusted the spine of a deaf man, who subsequently regained his hearing. This event formed the basis of chiropractic care: the belief that the proper alignment of the body's musculoskeletal structure, particularly the spine, will enable the body to heal itself without surgery or medication. Gaining widespread recognition worldwide, chiropractic care is increasingly sought after for its effectiveness in managing both [chronic and acute pain](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1875958/). Rather than simply addressing symptoms, as is the case in some traditional treatments, chiropractic techniques delve into the root causes of pain, offering patients more enduring relief.

Chiropractic care, focusing on holistic, non-invasive treatment, offers a practical option for aging adults. Chiropractors can help to relieve age-related discomfort, improve flexibility, enhance balance, and reduce the risk of falls. The hands-on approach of chiropractic care emphasizes the body's healing abilities, making it an attractive option for older adults seeking to manage their health issues naturally and non-pharmacologically.

Yet, a misaligned spine can disrupt the seamless transmission of nerves, potentially leading to a multitude of health problems. Chiropractic adjustments aim to realign the spine, mitigate nerve interference, and optimize the function of the nervous system. Through hands-on manipulation techniques, chiropractors delicately apply pressure to targeted areas of the spine, progressively restoring proper alignment.
