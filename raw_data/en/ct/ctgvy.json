The report sets forth my opinion of market value, along with supporting dat a and reasoning which form the basis of my opinion. The purpose of this appraisal is to estimate the current ma rk et value of the subj ect prop erty, as of the effective date of t his report. The property r ights appraised in this report are the fee simple estate. Personal property (business value, furniture, fixtures and equipment) was not included in the valuation of t he subject p roperty. The rep ort that follows this letter sets f orth my opinion of value and is qualified by certain definitions, limiting conditions, and certifications that are detailed in the report . Th is appraisal confo rms to t he Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice issue d by the Appraisal Standard s Board of the Appraisal Foundation. I have considered location, size, utility, uses for which th e property could be employed , sales of comparable properties, and other pertinent data. Cu rrent Market Value: It is my opinion, and I hereby certify, the market value of the fee simple estate of the subject real property, State Correctional Institution - Pittsburgh (SCI - Pitt sburgh) , containing approximately 21.7 a cres, as of March 26, 2023 , employing the extraordinary assumptions and hypothetical conditions contained herein, is $3,000,000 Three Million Doll ars M I CHAE L B AKER I NTERNATIONAL A PPR AISAL M AY 2, 2023 SCI - P ITT SBURGH This letter does not make up a complete report. The accompanying report follows this letter. Please note the certification, ass umptions and limiting conditions on t he following pag e s . This as si gn ment was performed for an agreed upon fee that is/was not contingent upon the results or con clusions in this report. No other compensation other than the contract fe e was made to the appra isers. It should be understood that t he acceptance of t hi s as sig nm en t was not contingent on reporting a specific (dictated ) value; nor was the acceptance of the assignment contingent on our conclusion of a requested minimum or maximu m value; nor was the ac ceptance of the assignment predicated in any way upon t he app rov al , extension, or modification of an existing or pending l oan for which the subject real estate is or may be pledged as collateral. In accordance with USPAP, we must rep ort that over the past three years, the appraiser signing th is report ha s no t pr epar ed an a ppraisal on this property, nor has he performed any ot her services related to this prop erty. Shaun A. Henry conducted physical observations of the subject site on July 28, 2022 . In a ddition to exterior observations during the walking tour of t he c ampus, the appraiser had access to the interior of 17 of the 2 6 numbered buildings . Exterior only ob servations were ma de o f those buildings that were reportedl y un safe to en ter , i nac cessible , or those identified as ancillary improvements. Shaun A. He nry subsequently made exterior o bservations from the street on Marc h 26, 2023. Shaun A. Henry ha s personally prepared the anal ysis and formed the opinions presente d i n this report withou t signif icant real property appraisal assistance from any other perso n . As part of my observations, it was not possible to view conditions be neath the soil. The existence of haz ardous material, which may or m ay not be present on or in the property, was not observed by the appraiser . T he appr ai se r h a s not made a soil test or test of underground water. Additionally, the appraiser is not qualified to detect suc h substances. A Phase I Environmental Site Assessmen t ( ESA) was conducted in S eptember 2022 by R hea Engineers & C on sultants, Inc. (Rhea) , in conjunction with the S CI - Pittsburgh Land Use Feasibility S tu dy , and has been provided for our review. A s part of the Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, R hea prov ide d information regarding topography, s oils, geology, and hy dr ology, which are detailed within our site des cription and analysis.

F indings and con cl usions of the Phase I I Environmental Site Assessment are discussed in the subject property analysis section of this report. In the ab se n ce of core borings, or other tests, it has been assumed t hat there are no o ther unusual subsoi l c onditions, or ha zardo us substances that would adversely affect the marketability of the subject property other tha n the findings of the Environmental Site Assessments by Rhea . Further, it is assumed that there are no mineral d ep o sits of a commercial nature underlying the subje ct property. This appraisal is of the surface rights only and is not inclusiv e o f any applicable oil, gas or mineral rights. The existence of any other hazar do u s material, w h ic h may or may not b e present on or in the property, was not observed by the appr ai ser . The appraiser , however, is not qualified to detect suc h substances. A Ha za rdous Material Surv ey, conducted November 1 5, 2022 through December 7, 2022, was performed by Rhea Engineers & Con su lt ants, Inc. and Michael Baker International, I nc, to surve y the 43 st ruct u re s on site for environmental and hazardou s material . As bestos Cont aining n g P aint (LCP), and other hazards, ref err ing to light bulbs and fixture s , t hermostats, exit signs, smoke detectors, mold, and air condit i o ning units that may contain hazardous materials requiring various controls for proper hand ling or disposal , were found . T he finding s of the survey and costs a sso ciated with asbestos abatement are summarized in the subject property anal ysis section of th is report. The value estima te does not take into account any negative or positive factors caused by existing or forthcoming EP A or ot her regulations. Unless otherwis e noted, I have not completed nor have I contracted to have c ompleted an investigation to identify and/or quantify the p re sence of wetland conditions on the subject property. Since the ap praiser is not qualified to make a determination of whether an a rea is a wetland a nd whether spec ific activ ity requires a permit, the client is urged to retain the services of an expert i n t his field. Although there is a possibility that wetlands exist on the subje ct property, the value estimate expressed herein is pr edicate d on the as sumption t hat t here are n o wetlands for which a permit would be required. The Phase I ESA completed by Rh e a Engineers & Consu ltants , Inc. , indicates there are no wetlands or federal w e t land areas within the subject site, according to National We tlan d Inven tory info r mati on provide d by EDR.

I n this appraisal report, all three approac hes to val ue were considered: The Income Capitalizati on Approach; th e Sales Comp arison Approach; a nd the Cost Approach. Valuation Issues: The subject property is best classified as a s pecia l use property, a former c orrectional fac ility , SCI - Pittsburgh, currently unoccup ied . As such, the property rights being appraised ar e the fee simple estate in th e subj ect real property . The following was extracted from the SCI - Pittsburgh Land Use Feasi bility Stu dy Phas e O n e Task 1.6.2 - Du e Diligence: Real Estate Market Ana lysis prep ared by Michael Baker I n ternational : For the Land Use Feasi bili ty Study, inclusi ve of th is Market Analysis, Michael Baker ass umes the property will be conveyed by DGS either through a competitiv el y selected \"buy er\" as specified under Ac t 24 or vi a direct c onveyance to an appropri ate public sector entity who will l ead the future develo pment ef fort.

A Preliminary Hi ghe st and Best Use A ssessmen t, prepared in O ctober 2022 , determi ned the two highest and best uses to be industri al (primary use) and public park uses (supporting use) . The Assessment further out lined the following a creage per use: Source: Mich ael Bake r I nt ernation al, Inc., 2023 The Income Ca pitalization A ppro ach w as considered in this appraisal. However , the subject property is not considered an income producing proper ty at this stage , as a \" sh o vel ready \" industrial site .

The Sales Comp arison Approach wa s consi dered for this a ppraisal ass ignment an d was developed for the market value estima te of the subje ct pr operty because th e Sal es Comparison Approach reflects buyers' and sellers' act io ns i n the marke t place.

Methodology: The highest and b e st use of the subje ct propert y was de termined through analysis of u ses that are l egally p ermitted, phy si cally p os sible, financia lly feasible and ma ximally productive. All three approaches to value we re considered in this analysis. Data was collected from public records, int erviews wi th real estate brokers/agents, and wit h other knowle dgeable sour ces.

It is noted th at the overall concep t of reasonable exposure encompass e s not only adequate , sufficie nt and r easonable time but also adequa te, sufficient and reasonable effor t. For sp ec ial - use propert ies , particularly w he n owned by a government entit y, such as is the case for the subject prop erty, quantifying a reasonable exp o sure time is often difficult. This is due to the fact that such pro perties are of ten sold via a sealed - b id RFP pr ocess, rather t han by conventional m arketing efforts. A typical w indow of time for coll ection of sealed bids is approximately six months. The s ubject property wou ld likely be marke ted and sold in a similar fash ion. As such, a reasonable exposure t ime for t he subj ect prop ert y, as of the eff ec tive date of this appraisal, March 26, 2023 , is concluded to be less th an one y ear. The reader should note th at exposure ti me is different than ma rketing t ime in that exp osure time is alway s presumed to precede the effec tive date of an app rai sal, whereas ma rketin g time is a time period immediatel y subsequent to the date of th e apprai sal. Exposure time is defined by USPAP as, \" (The) estimated lengt h of time t hat the propert y interest being ap praised would have been offered on the market prio r t o the hypotheti cal co nsummation of a sale at market val u e on the effective date of th e apprai sal.\" Americans with Disabilit ies Act (ADA) of 1990: A civil rig ht s act p as sed by Congress guaranteeing indiv iduals with disabilities equal opportunity in publ ic accommodations, emplo yment, transportation, government s ervices, and teleco mmunicatio ns.

Economic development s pecialists from mult ip le agencies not ed that there is a de mand for more sites f or manufacturing and industrial uses. Adjacent industr ial uses expressed a need to expand t heir operat ion s and could explore this site for future expansion. Research and deve lopment to support s us tainable transp ortation is a need wi thin the immediate ar ea including support for the Pittsburgh Regional Transit s electric transit vehicles. Medical marijuana g row er across the street needs mor e electrical power for their operations Site is limited in s iz e so reuse that supports expansion o f adjacent businesses has merit.

Resid en ts of the adjac ent neighborhood fee l disconnected from t his area along the river. The local advocacy group wants to ensure that redevelopment brings j ob opportun itie s for people who live in the Marshall - Shadeland neighborhood. Many g roups want to better co nnect the neigh borhood with the riv er through enhanced b ike and pedestrian facilities . Its location along the ri ve r and adjacency to the 3 Rivers Heritage Trail provides an opportunity to expand the use of the area for recreati onal purposes. A portion of site i s currently used as an un official trail head for the 3 River Heritage Trail but its need to be better de fi ned and there i s a need for more amenities to support re creational use rs . Amenities such as dedicated parking, ka yak access, improved fishing pier, ba throoms, an d the like sho uld be supported. T he Allegheny County Sanitary Authori ty (ALCOSAN) will be rel the existing trailhead to accommodat the authority's construction projects that will be cond ucte d during the next several years. The new tr ailhead will b e located on proper ty located on the southern side of S CI Pittsburgh closer to th e City. An es timated 97,000 cyclists use the SCI - Pitts burgh riverfront, as part of the unofficial trail head, o n an annual basis . This existing usag e may suppo rt future eate ries and events alo ng the trail. The trail is used for recreational purposes by t he employees of the adjacent business. There is a desire to connect the trail from the river to Riverview Park, t hrou gh the neighborhood. The trail is also used to access the downtown for jobs a nd shopping by local residents . MAR KET ANALYSIS (CONTINUED) 32 Neighboring businesses with m ore industrial type of uses such as ALCOSAN and Duquesne L ight as well as low visibility from r oadways mak es retail, residential and office less desirable options for future d evelopment of the proper ty . Although adja cent uses are seen as an opportunity for reuse options, the surrounding uses which are industrial, and lack of visible access from road ways makes the site n ot optimal for retail, hospitality, office, and residentia l uses. Road access is su fficient, but t he site does not have good rail or river access. The site is not adjacent to the river but rather separated from direct access by the Trail. The current el ectrical grid would not support any major reuse and would n eed to be improved. Insu ff icient T ranspor tation Infrastructure and limited parkin g availability does not support end uses that would genera te high traffic volume or create a hi gh parking need. The site is on the Nationa l Register of Historic Places which provides an opportunity fo r preservation of some of the site's assets, either thr ough historic markers or reuse of buildings or materials . There are 24 contributing resources identified within the nomination including b uildings, structures, and sites. A ll those identified as co nt ributing could potentially utilize Federal Historic Reh abilitation Tax Credits and State Historic Preservation Ta x Credits for preservation and restor ation proje cts. There was consensus that the 150 - year history of the site neede d to be memorialized eith er through histor ic markers, repurposing of some of the c ontributing structures, or reuse of material within the si te. The site has been used by the fil ming indust ry over ma ny years which has brou ght jobs and investment i nto the Pi ttsburgh community. This h elps to support preservation of some of the site. The M ain P enitentiary B uilding is the primary focus for the fi lm industries interest in the site.

The portion of the neighborhood located southwest of these transportation co rridors is entirely developed w ith industria l - scale and intensity of u ses - including the SCI - Pittsburgh f acility - while the remaining neighborhood area located northeast of the transportation corridors is predominantl y develope d with residential communit ies . The entire 21.7 - acre SCI - Pit tsburgh property is locate d within the City of Pittsburgh's Ri verfront - Genera l Industrial (RIV - GI) Zoning District which is intended to address a variety of industrial uses. T he zoning district accommodates both general ind ustrial uses, as well as heav ier industrial uses that may p roduce external impacts such as sm ok e, noise, glare , or vibration. Outdoor storage and related outdoor activities may also be included in the operati on of such uses. Th ere are provisions with this newer zoning district that re quir es a 125 - foot Riparian Buf fer Zone (setback) area for all ne w development wit h in the RIV - GI zoning district . This is designed to support restoration of the river from decades of overdevelopment and to encourage more access to the water for recreationa l pu rposes. Water Dependent o r Water Enhance d facilities and la nd scaping is perm i tted within the b uffer zone. There are Performance Points incentives that can be used for devel opment that meet ce rtain criteria. T hese points can be used to permit increa sed building height or reduce the riparian buffer set back Perf or mance Points ca n be gained through sustainable and equity enhancements to new development. These enhancements ca n include things su ch as energy effic iency upgra de, Low Impact Development de sign s, local hiring practices and the like. The City of Pittsbur gh 's Zoning Code r egulates off - street parking requirements for both new development and expansion of and changes to existing uses. Gi ven the overall la ck of and h igh demand for available land for development within the pr oject area, any new development of t he SCI - Pittsbur g h property will be challenged to meet the code's parking requirements that include, but are not l imited to, the foll owing surface park ing restric tions per \u00a7 905.04.I.2 of the cod e: o No surface parking shal l exceed seventy - five (75) parking s paces on a sing l e Zoning Lot or group of lots under common ownership. MAR KET ANALYSIS (CONTINUED) 34 o Any surface parking lot located between a b uilding and the riv erfront, including across a s treet, shall have a maximum o f fi fteen (15) parking spaces. Given these restrictions, new use s for the SCI - Pit t sburgh site may indeed need to consider alternative parking methods including the construction of a parking garage a nd/or contributing to a mobil ity improvement trust to achi eve a reduction to the code's minimum parking standards.

Industrial Real Estate Analy s is Pittsburgh Ind ustrial Market The Pittsburgh Indus trial Market is com prised of a seven - county regi on including Allegheny, Armst rong , Beaver, Butler, Fayette, Was hington, and Westmoreland Counties . This geograp hic area is the same as the Pittsburgh MSA. Source: Costar, 2022 According to Costar, a leadin g national provider of real estate da ta, t he reg ion's more rural location his tori cally has hindered large - scale speculative logistics development , leading to a lack of available supply . However, this lack o f supply has sp ared the area MAR KET ANALYSIS (CONTINUED) 36 from market disruptio ns and has poised P ittsburgh's indust ry market f or growth in recent years. Cu rren t Pittsburgh market attributes include: The market currently has 215M square f eet ( SF ) of industrial space, more than half of which is for l ogistics. The average vacancy rate is 5.3%, which fell over the past yea r due, in p art, to the rapid acceleratio n of e - commerce. In total, 1.6M s f of new space has been delivered within the pas t 12 mo nths. Although current construction ac ti vity is near re cord - level for the market, it is we ll under the Nation al Index. Industri al building space under construction in Pitt sburgh represents 1.9% of inve ntory compared to the national average of 4.0%. More li mited levels of construction are typic al for markets in the region and is in line with dev elopment levels in peer markets such as Clevelan d. Transportation improveme nts, including the Southern Beltwa y, have supported industrial developer interest in areas such as the Parkway West Corridor. C os tar indicates t hat the Parkway West Corridor is th e top location for industrial develop ments in th e Pittsburgh Market. Figure 1 : Pittsb urgh Industrial Market Key Indicators Source: Co star, December 2022 MAR KET ANALYSIS (CONTINUED) 37 North Pittsburgh Sub - Mar ke t The Pittsbur gh Market has many submarkets, inc luding eight in and surrounding the C ity of Pitt sburgh and immediate suburbs. The SCI - Pittsburgh property is loc ated in the North Pittsburgh Sub - Market , shown i n as i llustrated on the adjacent map. North P ittsburgh currently has 18.6 million SF of industr ial space. Like the larger metro mark et area , lo gistics facilities acco unt for th e largest propo rtion of this local supply, accounting for approximately 13.3 M S F or 72% of all industrial SF . The local inve n tory also includes 3.7 M SF of specialized space an d 1.6 M SF of flex sp ace. The vacancy rate at 5.7 %, has trended downwar d by 1.2 % i n the past yea r. Vacancy refers to empty properties not listed for lease or sal e, compared to the availabil it y rate which sh ows vacant properties actively being marketed. Net absorption over the past year was app roximately 230,000 SF , which is m uch high er than recent ye ar s . Net absorption compares total move - ins to total move - outs by SF and does not include lea se renewals. Over the past five years, the submarket has posted net absorption of - 110,0 00 SF per year, o n average. Costar indicates net a bsorptio n h as been impact ed by demoli ti on activity in the sub - market area. Rents increased by 4.8% over the past 12 mo nt hs, which is po sitive and slightly above the 4.1% average annual g ain over the past de cade. Industrial rents in No rth Pittsburgh are cur rently $ 8.8 0/SF, which is g enerally in line with the Pittsburgh metro average. L ogistics r ents are $8.40/SF, which are a lso generally i n line with the metro average for that subtype. Th ere is 100,000 SF un derway in North P ittsburgh, the most space under c onstruct ion in more than fi ve years. It is a single building , which is described in the se ction below. While this is n ot the only const ruction the submarket has seen in recent memory, it does represent a re versal from the o verall tren d. Specifically, the i nventory ha s contracted o ve r the past 10 years . As previously noted, demolition activity h as outpaced new construction . In the North P ittsburgh Sub - Market, logistics space represents th e area with the most demand , demonstr ated by the current l ow vacancy r ates and lo w availability r ates. There is less demand, currently, for specialized industri al and flex, both of which h av e higher vacanc y rates and availability rates in the sub - market.

The project si te is beside existin g large - sca le logistics u sers, includi ng Fed Ex Freight and Central Transp ort, and has immediate access to the Pennsylv an ia Turnpike at the Butler Valley exit. Multi - Tenant Project located on Executive Drive (38,000 SF ) . A second projec t is also current ly pr oposed al ong Executive Drive in Gibs onia. The listing shows the propose d project will have 38,000 SF, 40 docks, and tw o drive - ins, su ggesting the building will be for a logistics user. The property is 17.2 acres in si ze. Expansion at 2920 New Beaver Aven ue (38,683 SF). There is an existing, multi - tenant 285,0317 SF manufacturing building at 2920 New Beaver Avenue, built i n 1970.

At its existing buildi ng, two te nants are liste d as Pe nnsylvania LLC (120,000 SF for cannabis growing/processing activities) and We isner Steel Pro ducts (52,000 SF of manufacturing). Based on PA Department of Health permi t informa tion, Goodblend i s in partnership wit h t he Unive rsity of Pittsb urgh School of Med icine (Academic Clinical Research Center). 5 The proposed 38,683 SF expansi on is listed on C ostar. News articl es suggest the expansion will be for Goodblend's growing and proce ssing operations . Summary of Finding s for Indus trial Based o n interview fi ndings and key market indicators, there is market potential for industrial reus e. Key market ind icators suggest future absorption of new square footage on site to be approximately 1 00,000 square fee t per year in the ne a r term . Th is is below t he maximum reu se pot ential, as previously discussed. However, it's important to note that thi s w ell - establishe d industrial area in the North Pittsburgh Sub - Market is built out with demolitions ou tpacing new const ruction. Stakeholder interviews suggest ther e is ample exi sting market demand for new pad ready sites . Based on zoning requirement s - whic h d ictate that th e maximum potential of the site could only be facilitated through the construction of three or more bu ildings - it is forese e able that the site woul d be subdivide d by a future developer and sold or leased to multiple end users. Zoning restri ct i ons and key ma rket indicators suggest that SCI - Pittsburgh site will not and could not be used for a single large - sca le warehouse/logisti c s user (e. g., 1 million square foot w arehou se). KET ANALYSIS (CONTINUED) 41 O ther Potential Use s Office Office space is not a primary candidate fo r reuse for the SCI - Pittsburgh site, given the intensity of industrial uses along the riverfront. T he local office m arket, additionally, does not c ompe te well with downtown P ittsbu rgh and suburban locations, where easier transportation access (multiple rou tes in/out) and nicer amenities for office employees such as eating establishments are attractive s ite selection fea tures. However, eve n those loc atio ns are struggling to re cover from the Covid - 19 pandemic, which has reshaped global work patterns with rem ote and hybrid work schedules. The SCI - Pittsburgh site is located in the I - 279/I - 79 Northwest Offic e Submarket in Pi ttsburgh. It is a mi dsized subm arket that contains 2.7M SF of of fice space. The vacancy rate has been essentially unchanged over the past ye ar, but at 10.9%, the rate is well above the long - term average as of the fourth quarter of 2022. O ver the past five years, the submarke t has poste d negative net absorption o f - 11, 000 SF per year on average. Rents edged up by 0.5% over the past year, howev er, trails the area's average annual growth rate of 1.4% over the pa st decade. According to Costar , the Pittsburgh metro's overall offi ce market i s also on \"shaky ground\". N et abs orption has been negative over the past 12 months at - 876,000 SF. Demand wil l likely remain in the red over the near - term following announcements from companies like ATI which are relocating t heir headquarters ou tside of Pi ttsburgh. The Northwest Off ice Su bmarket's poor performance will likely preclude office as a feasibility reus e of the SCI - Pittsburgh property. Indoor Sports Complex Stakeholder interviews indicated the City of Pittsburgh may have an unmet marke t demand fo r a large indoor sports com plex. This market analysis did not evaluate the market demand for sports facilitie s in the city ; however, the market analysis did evaluate , at a high level , if the SCI - Pittsburgh si te would be suite d for indoor recreat ional uses. According to a study by th e City of Virginia Beach, indoor sports facilities in the Mid - Atlantic region host 25 - 40 weekend tournaments each year with up to 200,000 annual visitors. With the influx of visitor s, a facility can generate up to 15,0 00 hotel ni ghts per year. S ite selecti on cri teria for indoor sports facilities include s ease of access, proximity to and variety of nearby restaurant s and hotels to support vis itors, analysis of age demographics in an a rea for the custo mer base, parking, a nd safety o f the surrounding neighborh ood. T he proximity to and variety of nearby eating establishments and hotels is a site selection constraint for the SCI - Pittsburgh site. A s the entire area is zoned for industrial u se and built out, there is limited po tential for an indoor sports complex t o draw restaurant and hotel uses in nearby proximity. The presence of industrial MAR KET ANALYSIS (CONTINUED) 42 n eighbors would also be deterrent to this type of use, wh ich is typically geared towards family frie ndly areas with m any amenities. Poor site acces s and limited parking avail abilit y would also cause the property to score very low in site selection among de velopers of sports complexes. The size of the SCI - Pittsburgh site could accommodate a n indoor spo rts use. Based on research, these typ es of facil ities can range from 50,000 to 15 0,000 square feet in size. Spooky Nook in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania has 700,000 square feet of space, and Grand Park Sp orts Campus in Westfield, Indiana features 377,000 square feet. Howe ver, site selection criteria ma ke this type of end use les s like ly than an industrial use. Impact of Historic Significance and the Film Ind ustry Historic Significance The entire site is l isted as a historic district on the National Park S ervice, Unites St ate Department of th e Interior ' s Register of Historic Plac es und er its historic name, Western State Penitentiary: Riverside Penitentiary. It s nomination was completed and submitted to the National Park Service in 2018 and listed on the reg ister on February 14, 2022. The si te qualifie s for the National Register under 2 of the 4 National Register Criteria Areas of Significance which includ es (A) Property is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patte rns of history an d (C) Property embod ies the dis tinctive characteristics of a typ e, period, or method of construction. Its period of significance starts wit h the construction in 1879 of the large main pri son along the river and runs through 1966 when the water tower was c onstructed within th e Historic Front Yard, which was the l ast ma jor construction prior to non - historic additions being made to the site. 6 Th e nomination identifies that there are a total of 24 buildings and structures remaining on the site that contribute to the historic sign ificance of the property. These inclu de bui ldings such as the main prison that parallels the river, the water tower as a contributing object, and structures including the exterior prison walls. The National Park Servi ce administers th e federal tax credit program an d to qualify, the structure must be certified as historic which can be accomplished through listing the struc ture individually on the National Register or a s a contributing structure within a Historic Distric t listed on the N ational Register.

If the site or portions of the site were privatel y held and operated as income producing busines ses , rehabilitation of those resources would qualify for both Federal and State Historic Tax Credits . 7 a. Federal Historic Rehabi litati on Tax Credits are available for up to 20% of all qualifying expenses relate d to rehabilitation which follows the Secretar y of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. Th ere is no limit o n the amount of cred it that can be applied to a project, a nd thi s is not a competitive program. b. State Historic Preservation Tax Credits are administered by the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development and provide for c redit of up to 25 % of all qualifying rehabilitat ion expenses up to a maximu m of $ 500,000. However, the program is competitive and is not guaranteed. 2. If the site or portions of the site were owned by a n on - profit for charitable use or by a municipality, re habilitation proj ects can tap into St ate funding programs administered by t he Pen nsylvania Historic and Museum Commission. These programs offer funding for smaller grants to help with planning and const ruction projects. They are most beneficial to non - pr ofit owners/opera tors to help prepare for larger funding programs for rehab ilitat ion . 8 3. Additional funding for preservation efforts by non - profit or public agencies is also available from the National Park Service 's , Save America's Treasures grants. Thi s program is for site s that are natio nally signi ficant.

Typically , groundwater flow mimics topography from high el evations to low. B ased on the proximity of the subject property to the Ohi o River Rhea infers that ground water flows west towards th e Ohio River. Grou n dwater at the subject propert y occurs at de pths ranging from 10.28 to 16.50 ft below top of casing (Rhe a, 2019). Accor di n g to the EDR r eport and the United States Fish and Wildli f e Service (USFWS) National Wetlands Inventory (NWI), the re are no wetlands mapped on the subject property .

Environmental Issues: (Sou r ce: Rh ea Engineers & C on s ultants, I nc. ) Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) A Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) was condu ct ed by R hea Engineers & Consultants, Inc. , in co njunctio n w ith the S CI - Pittsburgh La nd Use Feasibility S tudy , and has be en provided for ou r review. A s part of the Phase I Environme ntal Site Assessm ent, R hea provided information regarding topography, soi ls , geo logy, and hydrology, which are detailed wi thin our si te des cription and analysis . The ESA identified four Recognized Enviro nm e ntal Con d itions (RECs) affecting the subject prope rty , one Historic al REC (HREC), two Business Environmental Risk s (BER ), a nd si x de minimis conditions , as described below: R ECs: B a se d on review of historical u se information, the subject property has been used as a correctional facility since at least the mid 1880 ' s along with various support facilities, including hospitals, d in ing f acilities, power plants, laundry facilitie s, indus t ri al manufacturing facilities , and machine shops, among others. Operations at thes e facilities likely included the use of ha zardous substance s. As a result, the historic site use is considered a R EC . S UBJECT PROPERTY ANALY SIS ( CON TINUE D) 56 Bas ed on a review of the av ailable historic d ocu menta t io n, historic adjoining and s urrounding property use is considere d a REC due to the former presence of ASTs containing solven ts ad electroplat ing operations to the north and south of the subject p ro pe rty , respective ly, which have the potential to adversel y i mp act the subject p roperty. According to Rhea, 2019, lead and m anganese (soil) were present above the applicable PADEP Act 2 stan da rds f or a non - residential, used a quifer with le ss than o r equal to 2,500 ppm TDS. Le ad and manganese wer e detected in so il s above the appl i cable A c t 2 standard at four locations. PCE w as detected in groundwater above the applicable Act 2 standard in on e locat ion while metals were detected above Act 2 standar d s in all eight sample locatio ns. The known soil and groundwater concentrations abo v e applicable Act 2 standards on the subje ct property is co nsidered a REC. A large coal storage area was observed a lo ng th e eastern exterior of Buildings 27 and 27A . The c o al is no longer used and has likely been in this location since a t least 2005, when the SC IP po wer plant was converted from c oal to natural ga s. Leachate emanating from coal storage areas can impac t soil and groundwater; therefore, the coal stora ge area i s considered a REC. HREC: The subject pr operty is listed in the L UST database for a release that occurred in November 1997. Accor ding to the database listing, the LUST case has a \" Cle anup Completed \" statu s as of October 19, 2011, indicating that it has b e en addressed to the satisfact ion of the applicabl e regulatory aut hori ty (PADEP). B e cause the LUS T case has been addressed to the satisfaction of the PADEP without subjecting the p roperty to any re qu ired cont rols, as ev idenced by the lack of an A U L s, it i s considered a HREC. BERs: Ba sed on a review of t he available sup plemental physical setting resources, the subject property i s located in the 100 - year and 500 - year floodplain. The location of the s ub ject p roperty within the 100 - year and 500 - year floodpla i n is considered a BER as the presence of the floo dplains may requ ire additional dev e lopment and building costs. Rhea observed on e 2,500 - gallon diesel UST, one 6,000 - gallon gasoline UST, and one 8,00 0 - gallo n diesel UST on the subject property. Acc or d ing t o J ustin Mo ore, the USTs have been emptied and cur rently have a \" t emporarily out of u se \" status as of February 2020. The USTs are set to be cl osed and removed in S UBJECT PROPERTY ANALY SIS ( CON TINUE D) 57 November 2022 (Interview). The USTs a re co nsidered a BER as any potential contaminat ion disc o ve red during the removal of t he tanks could lead to additional in vestigation and/or cleanup costs. De M inimis Conditions: Rhe a observed emp t y drums in Buil ding s 29 a nd 43, drums containing soap con c en trate in Buildings 11 and 18, and a drum contai ning an o il y - water mixture. The drums located within the bui l ding on the subject property a r e unlikely to have adversely impacted the su bject property are con sidered a de minimis condition. Minor oil staini ng was observed on the interior of Buildings 11, 12, 24, 2 6, 2 8, 29, 32, and 35. The o il staining is gener ally limited to discrete area s wit h in the buildings. The minor oil staining is unlikely to h ave advers ely impacted the sub ject property and is consi de red a de minimis condition. Rhea observed furni ture, eq u ip ment, machinery, tools, mai ntenance supplies, a nd various surp l us items and debri s through out the buildings on the subject property that wer e ab andoned w hen the SC I P closed in 2017. The solid was te and debris observed within the buildings on th e subjec t p r operty is unlikely to have adversely impacted the subject pro p erty and is con sid e red a de minim is condition. R hea observe d additional aband oned e quipment throughout the subject property, includin g dies e l generators, shoe repair equipment, indus trial ov e ns , industrial sheet metal cu tting equipment, gre ase trap, forkli ft, x - ray machine, machine sh op equipment, and portable pump s and generators. The abandoned equipment observed within the buildings on the subject property is unli kely to have adver sely imp a ct ed the subject pr operty and is considered a de minimis conditio n. Rhea observed e m p ty 5 5 - gallon rusted metal drums on the e xterior of Buildi ngs 23 , 24, and 36. The rusted metal drums are unlikely t o hav e adversely impacted the subject pr operty and is c o ns idered a de minimis conditi on. An area of solid w aste debris, i ncluding metal and plastic fencing, tires, pallets, and main tenance equipment was observed east of Building 24. The solid waste debr is loca ted west of Building 24 is unlikely to hav e advers e ly impacted the subject pr ope rty and is considere d a de minimis c ondition. Based on these find ings, a Phase II ESA was recomm en ded to determin e the subsurface en vironmental condition s of the s u bject p roper ty. S UBJECT PROPERTY ANALY SIS ( CON TINUE D) 58 Phase I I Environmental Site Assessm ent (ESA) Th e Phase I I Environmental Si te Assessment (ESA) was conducted by R hea Engineers & Consultants, Inc. , in January 2023 , and is included in its entire ty in the addenda. A s part of the Phase I I Envir on me ntal Site Assessment, R hea provided informati on regard i ng subsurface conditions. C onclusions: ( Sour ce: Rhea Engineers & Consultants, I n c . ) None of the soil samples collected during the subsurfac e investigation contained VO Cs at concentrations above t he ir res pective Act 2 standard. One soil sam ple c ont ained m an ganese at a concentration a bove the Act 2 standard. The pres en ce of manganese i s likely a result of natural processes as manganese is natu rally occurring in rock and so il. The remaining soil sa mp les co llected during the subsurface investigati on did no t c metals, including tr ivalent or hexavalent chr omium, abov e their re spectiv e Ac t 2 standar ds. PCE was detected in groundwater at ( Mon Well MW - 06 above the a pp licabl e Act 2 standard . Temporary monitoring w ells MW - 0 4 , MW - 05, and MW - 06 are locate d in the central portion of the subm ect property wi th i n the prison walls. The source of the PCE detected in MW - 04, Mw - 05, and MW - 06 is likely attributed to the histori c indust rial use of the subject property. MW - 03 i s located in the north/ northe astern por tion of the subject property in an a sphalt - paved area within the prison walls. The source of the PCE detected i n MW - 03 is not well de f ined as this detection is an orde r of mag nitu de greater than the PCE levels found in tempor a ry monitorin g wells - 04, MW - 05, and MW - 06 and the location of t he MW - 03 does not app ear to be located downgradient of any know n histor ical industrial uses on the subject property that are typical ly reco g nized as a PCE source. An additional inv estigatio n w ould be require d to determi ne if the source of the PC E dete cted in M W - 03 is a re s ult of historical on - site industrial activities or an off - site source. TCE was detected in groundwate r at MW - 03 a b ov e the applicable Act 2 standard. The TCE detec ted i n t h e well is likely a result of the reductive dichlorination of t he PCE detected in th i s well as TCE is a daughter product of PCE. Cis - 1,2 - DCE, another daughter product of PCE, was also detected in MW - 0 3 at a level below th e Act 2 standa rd. Methyl aceta t e, PCE, toluene, and TCE were detected at other temporary monitor ing well locations at levels below their respective Act 2 standards. Three met al s (arsenic , iron, and manganese) were detected in ground wa te r samples at con centrations above their respe ctive Ac t 2 standards. Arsen ic S UBJECT ANALY SIS ( CON TINUE D) 59 exc eeded the applicable standard in MW - 10 and MW - 11 . L ocated in the western portion of the subject property. Iron and manganese concent rations exceeded the applicable Act 2 s ta nd ard in fo ur and six locations, respectively. The p re s ence of arsenic in the gro un dwater may be related to naturally occurring conditions or may b e related to the historic use of the coal fired po wer plant at the subject property as arsenic is a by - pro du ct of c oal ash. Manganese and iron are natural ly oc c ur r ing in groundwater and con centrations may not be indicative of environmental contam i nation. Recommendations: ( Sour ce: Rhea Engineers & Consul tants, I nc. ) It is Rhea ' s professional opinion that the pr ev ious indust rial activities have no t impacted site s oi l s to an extent that would adversely affect future earth - distur bing activities at th e subject property. Due to the level of manganese above th e Act 2 standard for soil at (Soil Bearing) SB - 11, Rhea re co mm ends t hat a Health and Safety Plan ( HASP ) a nd a S oi l Management Plan ( SMP ) be prepared in order to develop procedu res to limit potentia l exposure to impacted soil during future earth - disturbing site preparation and construction ac ti v i ti es. No additi on al actions or investigations are recommended a t this ti m e for site soils. The HASP should include appropriate health a nd s afety procedures f or site workers working within potentially impacted areas. The HASP should also provide procedures to avoid expos ur e to subsurface contamination. If potential ly conta m in a ted soil s are planned to b e transported, disposed of, or other wise remediated, the s ite must abi de by the provisions set for the in the PADEP Residual Waste Management re gulations (25 Pa. Co d e Chapt er s 287 to 299). The p u rp ose of the SMP is to pro tect h um a n health and the environme nt during the handling an d /or excava tion of soil as p art o f the redevelopment of the subject property. The SMP shal l detail procedures to be followed to ensure that mangan es e in soil is managed at the subject property to limi t e x posure to workers and othe r receptors during ea rth - disturbing activities. The SMP w ould also address proper handling, stockpiling and disposa l of any soils in proposed construction areas, maintenan ce o f subje ct p roperty grades, site surface water drai n ag e /management and documentat ion. Previous industrial activities have likely impacted g roundwater on the subject p roperty. Furthermore, screenin g of VOC groundwater data indicates potential for va por in tr usion in any buildings located on the su bject p rop e rt y . To address the groundwa ter (VOCs and metals) and potential IAQ impacts (VOCs), R h ea recomm ends: Additional groundwater samples be collected an d analyzed from areas surrounding MW - 03 to confirm th e pr esence of PCE and TCE, further delineate the conta m in a tion plume, and to potenti ally identify its source. S UBJECT PROPERTY ANALY SIS ( CON TINUE D) 60 It shoul d be noted that Rhea ha s submitted a proposal for recomm ended supplemental samplin g activities to Michael Ba ker Internation al for approval b y PADGS ; Evaluation of the vapor intrusion path way m a y b e warranted in the future fo r any existing buildings that are not planned for demo l i tion. An evaluation of the vapor intrusion pathway was no t included in Rhea ' s proposal for supplemental sampling at t his time since the plans for retention or dem oliti o n o f buildings has not be e n d e cided; and Future site development plans will likely nee d to incorporate both Institutional (deed restriction s on g roundwater use) and Engineering controls (i.e., active o r pa ssive vapor mitigation systems) to mitigate i mpact s f r om groundwater contaminati on. Summary of Environmental Conditions and Probable Reme d ial Actions : ( Source: G aito & Associates, R hea Engineers & Consultants, I nc. ) The subject prope rt y has been used a s a correctional facility since at least t he mid 1880's al ong with various support f acilities, including hospitals, dining facilities, power p lants, laundry facilities (including drycleaning), industr ial manufacturing facilities, an d mac hi ne shops, among o th er s. Operations at these facilities like ly incl uded the use of hazardous substance s. The subject property is surrounded by commercial and i n dustrial properties, including Engineered Polymer Solution s Inc. and the Allegheny County Sanit ar y Authority to th e no rth, various commercial warehouses to the eas t, a Duqu esne Light Company service center to the south, and the Ohio River to the west. Be l ow is a summary of the findings of environmental site asse ssments done on the property and prob ab ly remedial actio ns n ecessary to support redevelopment of t he site in the f uture. It is assumed that the site will be entered in the PADEP Voluntary Cleanup P rogram to implement any remedial actions and that a Relief of Liability will be attained p rior to conveyance of th e pr operty. Soils Phase 1 and Phase 2 Env ironmen tal Site Assessments (ESAs) conduct ed by Rhea as part of the SC I - Pittsburgh Feasibility St u dy have concluded that that the previous industrial activi ties have not impacted site soils to an e xtent that woul d ad versely affect future earth - disturbing activi ti es at t he subject property. Rhea recommends that a Health and Safety Plan (HASP) and a Soi l Management Plan (SMP) be developed and utilized to limit potential exposure to impacted soil d ur in g fut ure earth - di st urbing construction activities. In the event th e subje ct property is developed w ith a paved parking lot, the pavement would essentially a c t as a cap to prevent contact to potential S UBJECT PROPERTY ANALY SIS ( CON TINUE D) 61 receptors with site soils containing manganese. No a dd it ional actions o r in vestigations are recommended at this time for s ite soi ls. Groundwater The ESAs d o indicate that previous industrial activities conducted o nsite have likely impacted groundwater on the subject prop erty. High levels of Volatile Organi c C ompounds (VOCs) ha ve been detected in monitoring wells within the property boundaries. Additional i nvestigation is planned to determine if the source of the VOCs is limited to the subject property or if there are al so off - site sources of contamination th a t are migrating on to the SCI PGH property. The groundwater would not be s uitable for use in its cur rent condition. However, the site is served by a public water supply and there is no use of raw groundwater at the site. In addition to direct contact c o ncerns for groun dw at er, screening of VOC groundwater data indicat e s potent ial for vapor intrusion. W hen releases of VOCs occur near buildings, volatilization of contaminants from the dissolved or pure phases in the s ubsurface can result in the intrusion o f vapor - phase con ta mi nants into indoor air. Given the unknown futu r e use of the subject property, vap or intrusion has been evaluated conservatively and includ e s the following assumptions: Any future building/structur e foundations constructed in the area o f temporary monit or in g wells MW - 03, MW - 04, MW - 05, and MW - 06 would b e within five feet of the groundwa ter level; and Any future buildings/structures would be n on - residential. To address the groundwater (VOCs and metal s) and potential indoor air quality ( IA Q ) impacts (VOCs) , Rh ea recommends the following potential remedia l actions : Deed restrictions be imp lemented at the subject property to prohibit the use of g r oundwater; Additional groundwater samples be collected and analyzed from areas surrounding MW - 0 3 to confirm the pr es en ce of PCE and TCE, further delineate the cont amination plume, and to potentially identify its source. It should be noted that this additi o nal work will be conducted during the Feasibility Study. Evaluation of the vapor intrusion pat hw ay be conducted f or s elect existing buil dings (based on results of addition al groundwater sampling) t hat are not planned for demolition ; and Engineering cont r ols (i.e., active or passive vapor mitigation systems) be incorporated into any future building d esigns to address t he potential for vapo r intrusion. S UBJECT PROPERTY ANALY SIS ( CON TINUE D) 62 Surface Wate r Given th e levels of groundwater co ntamination, potential migration of the contamination tow a rds and into the Ohio River should be evaluated. Typical ly, groundwater tends to flow towards a receiving surfac e wa ter body, such as the Ohio River. To date, V OC contam ination has not been detec ted in monitoring wells located in proximity to the river . It is believed that the foundation and structure of the Main Penitentiary Building may be act i n g as a barrier to g ro undwater flow towa rds the river, much as it a cts a flo od wall from the river to the site. Additional investigation is planned to confirm groundwater to surface water potential impacts. Soil dist urbance at the site including demolit io n of the Main Pen it en tiary Building, c ould change the groundwate r flow towa rds the river and potentia l contamination migration toward the river could become a concern.

It should be noted that a n abandoned tunnel system is located throughout the subject property. Rhea and MBI p ersonnel were not granted access to these tunnels due to h ealth and safety concerns related to their dilapidated c on dition. As a conservative approach, it should be assum ed that ACM, LCP, and other hazards are present within these areas .

Two illustrati ve concept scen ario plans are presented o n the following pages . Both scenario s are based on the s ite ' s reuse approac h illustrated in Figure 2 (based on the e xisting si te cont ext as illustrated i n Figure 1 ). As shown in Figure 2 , the riverfront area enco mpassing ~5.2 acres would be devoted to pu b l ic park use t o accommo date the RIV - GI District zoning ' s riparian setback b uffer requirement and preserve the Three Rivers Her ita ge T rail. This park are a also provides an opportunity to prov ide a new and improved trailhead facility that is currently loca t e d at the end of Westhall St. The r emaining portion of the site, ~16.5 acr es, would be devoted to industrial use as p ermitted an d de velopment thereupon regulated by the City ' s RIV - GI Dis t rict zoning. The RIV - GI District zoning requirements provide limi t a tions on the scale and location of future building deve lopment on the SCI - Pittsburgh site. Specifically, the Visual Access Co rri dor, maximum building le ngth of 500 feet, and 60% of facad es needing to be within 10 feet of the street ROW preclude the devel o p ment of a sin gle large building tha t would encompass th e majority of the s ite available for development (i.e., assu ming the R IV - GI's required riparian b uffer setback is reserved for publ ic park use) . Rather, maxi mization of the site would require the con s t ruction of mu ltiple , single story i ndustrial buildings with large 40 - foot bays rather than multi - story buildings . Site Devel opm ent Scenarios A and B, a s illustrated in Figures 3 and 4 , respectively, show the sit e could potentially yield between ~371,000 SF - ~ 411,0 00 SF of building e nvelope area. S cenario A assumes that all buil ding and infr astructure, exc ept for the Main Penitent ia ry Building, wo uld be removed through demolition. Under Scenario A , the Main Penite ntiary Building would be used for continu ed film i n dustry use and rela ted job training opportunities via the buildings former admi nistration space area. Sce nario B a ssum es that the sit e ' s existing buildings and infrastructure w ould be removed through ful l demolition. Both scenarios as s um e 20% ( i.e., ~190,000 sq. ft. of th e site ' s total of 945, 252 sq . ft., 21.7 acres) of the site would be dedicated for parkin g, loadin g , a nd circulation. Due to the linear alignment of the main p enitentiary buildi ng, its potential preservation a nd reuse t o accommo date t he filming industry wo uld permit a majority of the site to be reused for industrial p u rposes.

While porti ons of t he subject pro perty are located in a Special Flood Haza rd Are a (SFHA). This appraisal employs the hypothetical condition that f ill has been added t o the portions of the 16.5 ac r e s recommend ed for industrial use that are in a SFHA , in o rder to rais e the entire 16.5 acres above the S F HA wit h a 1 ' freeboard .

Additionally , this p ortion of the site is bise ct ed by the Three Rivers Heritage T rail.

The subje ct site gently slope s to the west towards t he Oh io River , and is generally at stree t grade wit h the bordering roadways . Access a nd visibilit y to the sit e is from Doerr St r eet, Beaver Avenue a nd Westhall Street . Th e phy sical attribut es of the site permit flexibility in development. Cur rently, th e s ubject property is served with public ele ctricity, pub lic water, public sewe r , and natural ga s . The size of the site wo uld be co n ducive to the legal ly p er mi ssi ble us es such as thos e outlined in our preceding analysis of legall y permissi ble uses. Most, if not all , of the legally permissible uses could be phys ical ly possible on the existing subj ec t site witho ut furth er assemblage. T h eref ore, m any of th e legally permissib le u ses would also be ph ysical ly possible. Financial Feasibility The appra isal princ ipl e of conformity holds that real property v alue is create d and sustained when the characterist ic s of a prope rty con form to the dema n ds of the market. T he subject property is located i n the City of Pittsburgh , Allegheny Co unty, Pennsylv ania , on the proper ty bo und by Beave r Avenue to the east, Westhall S treet to the nor th , Doerr St reet to the so ut h , and the Ohio Rive r to the west.

Nearby busin esses i nclude We i sner Steel Products , HM Document Solutions, Trane S upply, The Sherwin Williams Company, Allegheny County Sanitar y Authority (A LCO SAN ), Mckees Rock In dustrial En terpris es, Duquesne L ight Company, a nd Woods Run Co rp orate Office. Based on i nformation pr ese n ted in th e Market A nalysis section of this report, use of the subject site for office s or an indoor sports complex were fo und to not r epr esent financially feasible use s of the site, due to numerous factors incl uding a ccess, locational issu es, surrounding u ses, and lack of ne arby amenities, among others . C ommercial office space and indoor spo rts complexes were therefore not considered a financially feasible primary use of the subject property . Office (Source: Michael B a ker Internati onal, I n c .) Office space is not a primary ca ndidate for reuse for th e SCI - Pi ttsburgh site, given the intensity of industrial uses along the riverfront. The local office market, additionally, d oes not c ompe t e well with downtown Pittsburgh and suburban locations, wh ere easier trans p ortation access (mu ltiple routes in/out) an d nicer amenities for office employees such as eating establishments are attractive site selection features. However, even HIGHE ST AND BES T USE (CONT INUED ) 123 those loc atio n s are struggling to recover from the Covid - 19 pandemic, wh ich has reshaped global work pattern s with remote and hybrid work sc hedules. The SCI - Pittsburgh site is located in the I - 279/I - 79 Northwest Office Submarket in Pittsburgh. It is a mids ized subm arket that contains 2.7M SF of office space. The vacancy rate h as been essentia l ly unchanged over t he past year, but at 10. 9%, the rate is well above the long - term average as of the fourth quarter of 2022. Over the past five years, the submarket has poste d neg ative net absorption of - 11,000 SF per year on average. Re nts edged up by 0 .5% over the past y ear, however, trails the area's average annual growth rate of 1.4% over the pa st decade. According to Costar, the Pittsburgh metro's overall office market i s als o on \"shaky ground\". Net absorption has been negative over the past 12 mon t hs at - 876,000 SF. Demand will likely remai n in the red over the near - term following announcements from companies like ATI which are relocating their headquarters outs ide of Pi ttsbu rgh. The Northwest Office Submarket's poor performance wil l likely preclud e office as a feasib ility reuse of the SCI - P ittsburg h property. Indoor Sports Complex (Source: Michael B a ker Internati onal, I nc .) Stakeholder interviews indicated the City of Pittsb urgh may have an unmet market demand fo r a large indoor sp orts complex. Th i s market analysis d id not evaluate the market deman d for sports facilities in the city ; however, the market analysis did evaluate , at a high level , if the SCI - Pittsbur gh site would be suited for indoor recreational uses. According to a stu dy by the City o f Virginia Beach, in door sports facilities in the Mi d - Atlantic region host 25 - 40 weekend tournaments each year with up to 200,000 annual visitors. With the influx of vi sitors, a faci lity can generate up to 15,000 hotel ni ghts per year. S ite selection crite r ia for indoor sport s facilities include s ease of ac cess, proximity to and variety of ne arby restaurant s and hotels to support vis itors, analysis of age demographics in an area for t he customer base, parking, and safety o f the surrounding n eighborhood. The proximity to and va riety of nearby eating establish ments and hotels is a site selection constraint for the SCI - Pittsburgh site. A s the entire area is zoned for industr ial use and bu ilt out, there is limited potential for an indoor sports c omplex to draw r e staurant and hotel uses in nearby proximity. The pr esence of industrial neighbors would also be deterrent to this type of use, wh ich is typically geared towards family friendly area s with many amenities. Poor site acces s and limited parki ng availability w ould also cause the property to score very low in s ite selection among developers of sp orts complexes. HIGHE ST AND BES T USE (CONT INUED ) 124 Industrial (Source: Michael B a ker Internati onal, I nc .) The re al estate ma rk et analysis prepared by Michael Baker Internation al, concl uded t he followi n g regarding industr ial reuse of the subject p ropert y. \" Based o n interview findings and key market indicators, there is market pote ntial for industrial reus e. Key mark et ind icators suggest future absorption of new square footage on site to be approximatel y 100,000 square fee t per year in the nea r term . Th i s is below t he maximum reuse potential, as previously discussed. However, it's i mportant to note that thi s well - esta blishe d indust rial area in the North Pittsburgh Sub - Market is built out with demolitions outpacing new const ruction. Stakeholder interviews suggest ther e is ample existing market demand for new pad ready sites . Based on zoning requirement s - whic h dictate t hat th e maximu m potential of the site could only be facilitated through the construction of three or more bu ildings - it is foresee able that t he site woul d be subdivided by a future developer and sold or leased to multiple end users. Zoning restri ct ions and key ma rket ind icators suggest that SCI - Pittsburgh site will not and coul d not be used fo r a single large - sca le warehouse/logistic s user (e. g ., 1 million square foot warehouse). \" Given the uses which are preclude d by the t est of financial feasibility, the r emaining finan cially feasible scenario would include park use of the 5.2 - acre riverfront por tion of the propert y , with industrial redevelopm ent of the remaining 16.5 a cres . Max imum P roductiv ity Of the uses which are considered financially feas ible, thos e u ses must pr ovide the highest rate of return over the longest period o f time in order to b e co ns idered the h ighest and best use of the pr o perty. Based on the analysis of t he ph ysical ly possi ble , legall y permissible, and financially feasible us es, we hav e c oncluded th at the maximally productive , and highest and best use of t h e site , as vacant , is f or park use of the 5.2 - acr e riverfron t , with industrial red evelopment on the remaining 16.5 a cres .

VALUATION PROCESS 126 VALUATION PROCESS Th e valuation process is used to de ve lo p a supp o rtable e sti mate of market value based on the consideration of pe rtinent da ta. Typically, after defining the appraisal problem, perfo rmi ng a physical observation of the s ubject prope rty, and analyzing the mark et place, market value is estimated by a p pl y ing s pecifi c app raisal procedures that reflect three distinct meth ods known as the Income Capitalization Approach , the Sales Comparison A ppr oach, and the Cost Approach. The I ncome Capita lization Approach is a meth od of analyzing a prop er ty's abilit y to ge n erat e monet ar y b enefits and converting these benefits into an indi cat ion of val ue. This approach is predicated upon the principle that va lue is created by the anticipation of benefits to be derived in the future. Th e two most common me th ods to esti ma te ma r ket v alue b y the Income Capitalization Approach are direct capital iza tion an d y ield capitalization. Direct capitalization is based on app lyi ng an overall capitalization rat e to one year' s net operating income to d er ive an overall value . Yield capit al iz a ti o n qu a ntifie s the present value of cash flows and future sale proce eds over a n i nvestment holding period into an indication of value. The Sal es Comparison Approach uses sale s of similar p roperties as the basis for an indication of value . This approa ch i s a l so b a sed on t he principal of substitution whereby the value of a p rop erty, a s r eplaceable in the market place, tends to be set by the cos t o f acquiring an equally desirable s ubstitute pr operty. This approach is de ve loped by identifying c omparable s al es of prop e rties wi th similar utility to the property being appraised. Re la ti ve comp ari son is made based on the degree of simil ar ity or diffe re nces between the comparab le sales and the appra is ed property . Th e comparison indicates a value range for the apprais ed property. T h e Cost App roa ch is premised upon the principle of substit ution, and pre sum es that a reasonable buyer would n ot pay more than the cost to produce a su bstitute property ha vi ng similar ut il ity . Thi s approac h i s developed by adding the estimated value of the l and to the co st of the improvements. The basic steps of t he Cost Approa ch are to estimate land value as if v acant and es timat e the replacement or rep rodu ction cost new o f the improve me nt s. A ccru e d deprec iat ion caused by the physical deterior ation, functio n al obsoles cen ce, and economic (external) obsolescence is estimated and ded ucted from the cost new to arriv e at a depreci ated replacement or reproduct ion cost. The land v al ue estimate i s add e d to the depr eci ated cost, which yields a value ind ication by the Cost Appro ach . The final step in the appraisal process i s the reconcil iat ion of the indicated value resul ti ng from each of t he approaches utilized. Cons ideration is giv en to the rel at iv e a p plic a bility o f e ach of the approaches prior to conc luding with th e final val ue estimate. VALUATION PRO C ESS ( CONTIN UED) 127 Analyses Applied The Income Capita lization, Sale s C omparison, and Cost Approaches w er e all consid ered in the estimation of mar ket value for the su bj ect propert y . T he s ubje c t proper ty is bei ng appraised as vacant \" shove l ready \" indus trial site . The property rights being ap praised are the fee simple estate in the subject property re al e sta te. The Income A pproach has not bee n developed for this analysis , as the subject prope rty is being a pprais ed as vacant land, and is not considered an income p roducing prope rty . The Sales Comparison Approach was considered an d developed for this appraisal assignment be ca use the Sales Compa rison Approach reflects buyers ' and sellers ' action s in the marke t place. T he Sales Comparison Approach has been developed for this appr aisal . The highest and best use of the majority of the subject property as vacant i s concluded to be industrial develop ment with an adjoining park . Hence, numerous sales of vacant lan d deemed comparable to the subject site were identified an d analyzed for this assignment. The Cost Approach was also conside red , but was not developed, as t he C ost A pproach is most reliable w he n applied to newly constru cted properties. The Cost Approach has not been developed for subject property, as a vacant i ndustrial site . Accordingly, the Sale s Comparison Approach w as de ve l oped for th is assignment. INCOME CAPITALIZATION A PPROACH 128 INCOME CAPITA LIZATION APPROACH The Inco me Cap it al iza t ion A pp roach consists of methods, t echniq ues, and procedures that an apprais er uses to analyze a property's capacity to generate income and conv erts this income into an ind ic a tion of val ue. One basic investment prem ise is that the higher the ea rnin gs , the highe r the va lue. The Income Capita lizati on Appro ach allows the ap praiser to st ep into the shoes of the typ ical investor and most probable purch aser to the subject p roperty t y pe. Investo rs are concerned with the pro perty's income potential an d futu re m ark e tabil it y. The Income Capitalization Appro ach cons iders contract re nts and po ten tial ren ts as well as determ ining absorption rates and vacancy ra tes. The present valu e of ca sh flows and f uture sale proceeds are quant ified based upon the timing , dura ti on , s t abili ty , and risk of these componen ts of investme nt return. The in vestor tra des present dollars for the rig ht to receive future dollars in antic ipation of making a p rofit. Th i s is the Pr inciple of Anticipation, whic h is fundamental in the Inc om e Ca pi ta liz a tion Ap proach . Anticipation is the percep tion tha t value is create d by the e xpe ctation of benefits to be de rived in the future. In the real esta te market, the curren t value o f a property is usually not based on its historical prices or the co st of it s cre a tion; r ather, value is based on mar ket pa rticipat ion's perceptions of the fu tur e benefi ts and risks of acqu isition The Income Capitalization App roach assumes that th e value o f a property is equivalent to the present worth of anticipated benef it s to b e der i ved t hr ough o wnership. The benefits to ow ners of investment real e state are ass umed to occur over a measura ble holding period and consist of a s tream of net income ( the ret ur n on investm ent) plus a reversion (return of investment) upon the sa le or re fi nan c e at th e end of the holding period. The process of converting fut ure income in to a pre sent value is known as capitalization. There are two capi talization techniques used i n t he valuatio n of income producing real es tate. Direct Capitalizatio n conv er ts on e year 's stabi lized net income into a mark et value by dividing the income by an appropri ate capitalization ( overall) rate. This method is applica ble to property types where th e income wil l remain relatively stable, o r where income streams and /o r pr op er ty v alues a re exp ected to change at a c onstan t rate. Determining an ap propriate Cap italizat ion Rate incorporate s the terms of mortgage financing the required equity divi dends a nd the potenti al for capital appreciation. An alternative method of i nc ome va lu ati o n is yi eld ca pita lization, also ref erred to as th e discounted cash flow anal ysi s. Yield capitalization is a ppropriate for income streams that do not conform to a pat tern, a s e ach periodi c installment is separately d iscounted. The process req ui res in di vid u al de ci sions rega rding time CAP ITALIZ ATIO N APPROACH (CONTINUED) 129 uncertainty and risk, uti liz ing a capitalization rate th at attracts purchase capital to simil ar investments. The I ncome C ap i talization Approach is typically develop ed in the following order: 1. Gr oss In co me w ill b e develo ped by estimating pote ntial gross in come (gross reven ue) from c omp arable properties and the op erating history of the subject proper ty . 2. Net Operating Inc o m e (NO I) will be dev eloped by estimating operatin g expenses and deducting th is est im at e f r om gr os s inco me. Net operating incom e does not con sider depreciatio n, amortiz ati on, and interest. 3. Capitaliza tion of net operating income will be done by the division of the ne t operating income by a rate selected thr ough the band of investment m etho d to a r r ive a t a conc lusion of value by the incom e capita lization approach . 4. Discount ing of cash flows (NOI) will be done by a rate developed through mar ket extraction. For this appra isal, t he subject property is best classified as a \" shovel ready \" in d ustrial site and is not considered to b e an inc ome producing property. T herefore, the Income Capitalization Approach w as not considered an applicable method of valuation for the subject property. S ALES COMPARISON APPROACH 130 SALES COM PARISON APPROACH The Sales Comparison Appro ach is a method of e stimating market value wher e t he subject pro perty is compared to similar properties, which have bee n sold. T hi s a p proac h is bas ed on the principle of substitu tio n, whi ch states tha t if sever al competing commodities, goods, or services a re available, then t he one with the lowest pric e w il l attract th e greatest demand and receive the widest distribution. When ap pl ie d t o real estate, this method focuses on those e lem ents o f comparison which caus e p rices to vary. The Sales Comparison Approac h is considered imp o rtant to most appraisal pro bl e ms since it is based on the price paid for similar properties by typi cal buy er s in t he op en marke t. It is applicable to the appr ais al of all propertie s for whic h t here are a sufficient number of comparable sales. This approac h is most reliable when the pr o pe rty type und er analysis is bought and sol d regularly. Applying this approa ch i s a syste matic pr ocedure where similar sales are re search ed and analyz ed through th e most relevant elements of comparison. SI TE ANALYSIS Subject Site Based on the analysis of the physica lly possible, legally permissible, and fina ncially feasibl e uses, we have concluded that highest and b est use of the site as v acant is f or park use of the 5.2 - acr e riverfron t , with industrial red evelopment on the remaining 16.5 a cres . Units of Comparison In the valuation of the subject property, the pri ce per usable acre is selected as the appropriate unit of comparison. It is assumed that a buyer of the subject property would subseq uently dedicat e the 5 .2 acres of par k land to an entity such as the City of Pittsbu rgh . Ther ef ore , we have focused the sales comparison app roach on the 16.5 - acre industrial portion of the site utilizing the usable acre unit of comparison. In this case, t he useable acr eage of the subject property is the 16.5 acre s id e ntified for in dustr ial development . Elements of Comparison Key value element s under scrutiny that may require consideration include property rights conveyed, financing terms, conditions of sal e, market cond itions at the time of sale, location, and site chara cteris tics. These f actors are the primary influences on property prices an d tend to affect the price levels. I have researched industrial land sale s, and have at tempted to locate land sales that were similar to the subj ect in overall location, size and intended use of the site.

This property is located in a zoning district that permits various industrial uses such as warehouses, manufacturing, and contractor's offices. There was a 15,625 SF pump house easement at the front of the property that had little impact on development of the site, as well as typical utility easements along the street. Additionally, a 30' utility easement crossed the site extending from the pump house towards the river, and a 20' wide storm sewer easement extending from the street towards the river.

SALES COMPA RISON APPRO AC H (CONTINUED) 138 General Discussion of Elements of Comparison The comparable sales we re analyzed us ing r elative comparison an alysis, \"A qualitative technique for analyzing comparable sales: used to determine whether the characteristics of a comparable property are inferior, superi or or similar to those of the subject property\" 15 . In genera l, applicable eleme nts of comparison are analyzed, and each comparable sale is classified as inferior, similar or superior to the subject for each element of comparison. The five comparable land sales were analyzed and a djusted in order to e stimate a value based on sale price per acre for the subject pr operty. SUMMARY OF ADJUSTMENTS Real Property Rights When real property rights are sold, th ey may be the sole subject of the contract or the contract m ay include oth er ri ghts, less than all o f the real property rights, or even another property. Before t he price of a comparable sale can be used, the properties rights being conveyed in the compar able sale must be analyzed to determine if they are similar to the subject prop erty. If property ri ghts are different an adjustment may be required. The property rights under consideration for the site value are the fee simple estate. All of the comparab le sales were transactions of the fee simple estate; therefo re, no adjustm ents were made. Financin g The transaction price of one property may differ from that of an identical property due to different financing arrangements. For example, below market ra tes might be e xtended to individuals who have substantial ba nk accounts an d are therefore especially credit worthy. Conversely, below market interest rates often result in higher sale prices. Financing adjustments are commonly used on sales in which the seller pays po ints or finances the loan at a rate that diffe rs from the ma rket rate. No adjustment s for financing were required. Conditions of Sale Adjustments f or conditions of sale usually reflect the motivations of the buyer and the seller. In many s ituations, the conditions of sale significantly affect trans action prices. Suc h conditions that may require an adjustment include seller duress, auction sale, for eclosure or short sale, non - arm's - length transactions, and assemblages. No unusual conditions of sale were reported for the comparable sales. 15 The Ap praisal of Real Estate Appraisal , 14 th Editi on (Chicago: Appraisal Institute, 2013), 403. SALE S COMPARISON APPROA CH (CONTINUED) 139 Market Co nditions (Time ) Co mparable sales that oc curred under market conditions different from those applicable to the subject on the effective date of value require adjustment for any differences that aff ect their valu es. An adjustment for market conditions is ma de if general prop erty values have appre ciated or depreciated since the transaction dates du e to inflation or deflation or a change in investors' perceptions of the market over time. All of the co mparable sales have taken place subseq uent to the March 2020 onset of the Covid - 19 Pandemic . Howeve r, comparab le sale #5 occurred in November of 2020 , and was likely negot iated closer to the initial months of the Pandemic. Generally speaki ng, market cond itions have im proved for indust r ial properties since that ti me. Therefore , market conditions for co mparable sale #5 are considered inferior to current market conditions . Location Consideration for location within a market area may be required w hen the l ocational char acteristics of a comparable property differ fr om those of th e subject property. For i ndustrial sites, significant locational factor s include the proximity to major highw ays and employment centers. Drive time area maps generated by ESR I for 5 , 10 and 15 - mi nute drive times were analyzed for each of the comparable sa les and the subject p roper ty , in order to compare the proximity and access to major highways and trucking corridors. Dr ive Time Map - Subject Property Source : ESRI, 2023 SALE S COMPARISON APPROA CH (CONTINUED) 140 The subj ect property w ell located i n proximity to highways with I - 27 9 and I - 376 wi thin 5 - minute , and 10 - minu te drive s of the site , respectively via PA - 65 South , which is accessible within 1.6 miles from the site. Dr ive Time Map - Comparable Sal e # 1 and #4 Source : ESRI, 2023 C omparable sales #1 a nd #4 are located on Solar Drive in Find ley Industrial Park in Fin dley Township. This loca tion is considered similar to t hat of th e subject property overall, for industrial use. While the proximity to major highways i s s lightly inferi or, this factor is off set by access to the nea rby Pittsburgh International Airport (PI T), which is a positive factor for some industrial users. SALE S COMPARISON APPROA CH (CONTINUED) 141 Dr ive Time Map - Comparable Sal e # 2 Source : ESRI, 2023 The location of c omparable sale #2 , ne ar the souther n end of Neville Island , is c onsidered slightl y inferior to the subject property . Whi le I - 79 is located within a 10 - minute drive of the pro perty , additional major corridors are located predominately outside of the 15 - minute drive tim e area . SALE S COMPARISON APPROA CH (CONTINUED) 142 Dr ive Time M ap - Comparable Sal e # 3 Source : ES RI, 2023 Comparable sa le #3 is located i n the I - 79 North In dust rial Resea r ch Park in Al eppo Township , Sewickley. This location is considered similar to that of the subject overall due to the prox imity of I - 79 within a 5 - minute drive of the property , which connects the site to I - 279 an d I - 376 wi th in a 15 - minute drive . The Pittsburgh International Airport is also with a 15 - minute drive of this property. SALE S COMPARISON APPROA CH (CONTINUED) 143 Dr ive Time Map - Comparable Sal e # 5 So urce : ESRI, 2023 Compa rable sale # 5, located along the Monongah ela Riv er in the Ci ty of Duquesne , is considered inferior to the subject property in ter ms of l ocation, the locale lacks convenient access to ma jor corridors, with the exception of I - 376 near t he northern limits of the 15 - minute drive time area. Size Site size , based on usab le acres, was cons idered for the compa rable properties relative to the subject. Generally, the smaller the usable acreage , the higher the selling price per acre , due to the economies of scale. Co mparable sales #1 , # 2 and # 3 are consider ably smaller sites in comparison to t he subject property , while comparable sale s # 4 and # 5 are similar to the subject property in this regard . Site Characteristics Topography is an important factor in analyzing va cant land. Severe topograph y can limit t he functional utili ty of a site, whil e even mildly rollin g topography can increase site preparation costs due to increased grading. It should be noted here that the adjustments made for topogra phy also considered wh ether or not the comparable sale had a cl eared area that was available for dev elopment, as land th at is not cleared can also increase site preparation costs. Site shape can also influence development SALE S COMPARISON APPROA CH (CONTINUED) 144 potential of land tracts. It is im p ortant to note that o nly site characteristics within the usabl e portion of the si te were considered in this qualitative a nalysis employing the price per usable acre unit of comparison . Overall, comparable sales # 1 , # 2, #3 and #5 are considered simila r for site characteristics relative to the subject site . In additio n, comparable sale #4 is considered i n ferior to the subject property for this element of comparison . Approvals Many of the comparable sale s had approvals in place at the expense and effort of t he buyer. While this mitigates risk for the buyer, it is assume d that a buyer of the subject proper ty would be full y informed on permitted uses for the property and would have reassurance regarding the permissibility of the ir intended use. T herefore , the comparable sa les a re considered similar to the subject property in this regard . U tilities The type of utilities required or the presence of public utilities is an important factor for commercial land. The availability of public sewer, for example, can si mpl ify and reduce the development costs by negating the need for on - lot septic sys tems. The subjec t property and all of the comparable sales have access to public utilities , including natural gas . Zoning Zoning can have a large impact on the value of rea l estate as the zoning controls the allowable uses on a given tr act of land. Gener ally, less restric tive zoning has a positive influence on property value. T he subject property is located in the RIV - G I Gen eral Industrial Zoning Distri ct. According to the City's Zoning Code, th e R IV - GI District is \"intended to address a variety of indus trial uses. The di strict accommodates both general industr ial uses, as well as hea vier industrial uses that may produce external impacts such as smoke, noise, glare, or vibra tion. Outdoor storage a nd related outdoo r activities may also be included in the o perat ion of such u ses. The subdistrict is structured to pr event encroachment of no n - industrial uses, accommo date site design elements re lated to public safety, and maintain c ompatibility with surr o un ding uses.\" 16 All of the comparable sal es are locat ed in the zoning distric ts that permit industrial uses . However, some of these zoning districts a r e m o r e restrictive in the type of industrial uses permitted by right. C omparable sales #1, #3 and #4 a re considered more restrict ive tha n that of th e subject prop erty in regards to more intense indust r ial uses . 16 Pittsburgh Zoning Code, \u00a7 905.04.A.2.d. SALE S COMPARISON APPROA CH (CONTINUED) 145 T he remaining comparable sale s are co nsidered similar t o the subject property for zoning. Flood Zone Typically, properties locat ed in a special f lood hazard area are less desirable than proper ties that are not located in such an area, due to the associated flood in surance costs and the increased risk of damage to the property due to fl ooding. This appraisal employs the hypothetical condition that f ill has been added to the portions of the 16.5 acr e s recomme nded for industrial use that are in a Special Fl ood Hazard Area (SFHA), in o rder to raise the enti re 16.5 acres above the S FHA wit h a 1 ' freeboard . Additionally, the highest and b est use of the re mainder of the site located in the SFHA is for park use, and is not included in the usable acreage of the site. Therefore, the partial location in a special flood hazard area is not considered in thi s analysis utilizing the usable acre un it of comparison . Accordingly, all of the comparable sales are considere d si milar to the subject fo r this element of comparison .

The cost estimate is adjusted for th e depreciation evident in the e xis ting pr op erty. This approach is most r eliable when valuing new or propo sed construct ion when th e i mprov em ents re prese nt the highest and best use of the land a nd the land va lue is we ll supported. Depreciation is estimated for three separate elements: Ph ysi cal Det er ioration; Functional Obsolesc ence; and Ex ternal Obsolescence. The elements of deprecia tio n can b e curab le or i ncurable. Physical Deterio ration refers to wear an d t ear from regular use and age, and the impact of th e elements. Functional Obsole sc enc e is ca us ed by a fl aw in the structure or an outda ted design that dimin ishes the fun ctional uti lit y of a propert y. Th is can be caused by an impro vement that i s not adequ ate , or by a n improvement that is superadequate. Exte rnal Obsolescence is an impai rm ent to the s alability of the property due to factors outside the property. This can be location ne xt to an u ndesira ble e le ment, such as a busy road, or it can be caused by mar ket condi tions. The Cost Approach is not considered a reliable indicator of value fo r the s ubject prope rty , as this approach is most applicable to newly constructed building impro vements. For th is appraisal , t he subject p roperty is best classified as a \" sh ovel ready \" in dustrial site . T herefore, the Cost Approach is not an applicable appr oach to value for the subject property. RECONCILIAT ION AND CONC LUSION 149 RECONCI LIATION The su bject p roperty is bes t classif ied as an institutional property . T he property rights being appraised are th e fee simple estate in the s ubj ect proper ty real estate . In th e preceding pa ges of th is report, the In come Capitali zation Approac h , t h e Sales Comparison App roach , and the Cost Approach to val ue were considered t o estimate the market value o f the fee simple estate in the s ubject propert y as of the effec tive date of this report. The values indica ted by these a ppr o aches are summarized below : Income Capitaliza tion Approach The Income Capi ta lization App r oach looks at investmen t opp ortunities f rom the view of the t ypi cal invest or - buyer, bein g con ce rned with a pr operty's income generation potential an d future marke tab i lity. The Income Capitaliz ation Approach refle cts the actions of the buyers a nd sellers i n the market. The Income Capi talization A pproach is most effec tiv e when inc ome and expens es ca n be reasona ble estimated and stabilized. The Income Ca pitalization A ppr o ach w as considered in this appraisal. However , the subject property is not considered an income producing proper ty at this stage , as a \" sho vel ready \" industrial site . The refore , the Income Capi talization Approach is not considered an applicable method o f valuatio n for the subj ect property. S ales Compari son Approach The Sa les Comparison Appr oach con siders sales of sim il ar types of pr operties that have rece ntl y sold in the subje ct's market area. These sales have been compared to the subject and adjusted for dissim il arities betw een the comparabl e properties and the sub ject to arrive at an indic ation of value. The Sal es C om parison Approa ch also reflects the ac tio ns of both bu yers a nd sellers i n the market. The inherent weakness in the Sales Comparison Appr o ach is tha t no two sales or properties ar e exactly al ike. The Sales Compar iso n Approach wa s util ized to esti mate land value as a vacant \" sho vel ready \" industrial site . It is n oted that the land v a lue as vacant, $3,000,000 is g reatly ex ceeded by est imates for d emoliti on, h azardous mater ial abatement and raising the indust rial port i on of the site above the flood plain $ 47,841,084 . Additi onal cost s may be incurred for any necessary environmental r emediatio n, and abatement /disposal of hazardo us materials beyon d asbestos containing materia ls. Cost estimates for these items were not prov ided to the appraiser. This is an indication that it w ould no t b e fin ancially feasible fo r a developer or en d - user to acqui re the subject property as - is and bear the cost of demolition, environmental remedi ation , hazardous mate rial abatement and raising the indust rial porti on of the site above the flood plain . RECONCILIATION AND CONCLU SI ON (CONTI NU ED) 150 C ost Approac h Th e Cost Approac h is based on the premise tha t a bu yer wo uld pay no more to pu r chase an exi sting property than t hey would to b uild a s truct ure to suit t heir needs. T his approac h invol ves e stimating the r eproduction or replacement cost new , ded ucting the accr ue d depreciati on from all sour ces, and a ddi ng the value of the site as if va c ant. The Cost Approach has not been developed for the s ubjec t property, due t o the fact that su bject property is best classified as a \" sho vel ready \" vac ant ind ustri al site for this appraisal .

A Phase I Envi ro nmen tal Site A ssessment (ESA) was conducted by Rhea Engineer s & Consultants, Inc. , in conjunction with the SCI - P itts bu rgh L and U s e Feasibility S tu dy , and has been pr ovided for our re view . The ESA identified several Recognized Environmental Conditions ( RECs) affecting the subject prop erty, as described below: a. Base d on review of h istorical use information, the subject prope rty h as be en used as a co rrectional facility si nce at least the mid 1 880's along with various su pport facilities, including hospitals, d ining faciliti es, power plants , laundry facilities, industri a l manufacturing facilities, and machine shops, among others . Op era ti ons at these fa cilities likely includ ed the use of haz ardo u s substances. As a result, the historic site use is considered a R EC. b. Based on a review of the a vailable historic documentatio n , historic adjo ining and surrounding property use is consid ered a R EC due to the for mer presence of ASTs c ontainin g solvent s ad electroplating operations t o the north and south of the subject p roperty, respect ively, which hav e the potential to adversely i m pact the subjec t property. c.

FINAL PHASE I ENVIRONMENTAL SITE ASSESSMENT STATE CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION - PITTSBURGH LAND USE FEASIBILITY STUDY 3001 BEAVER AVENUE PITTSBURGH , PENNSYLVANIA 1 5233 Project No. 2390 September 1 9, 2022 Prepared for: Pennsylvania Department of General Services - Bureau of Real Estate 505 North Office Building Harrisburg, Pennsylvania 171 25 Prepared by: Rhea Engineers and Consultants, Inc. 333 Rouser Road, Suite 301 Moon Township, Pennsylvania 15108 T/Clients/ Baker /2390/Reports/R 3 i EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Rhea Engineers & Consultants, Inc. (Rhea) completed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA ) for the former State Correctional Institution - Pittsburgh (SCIP) property located at 3001 Beaver Avenue , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania (PA) 15233 , which includes Allegheny County Parcel ID s 44-B-100, 44 -B-25, 44 -B-26, 44 44 -C-124, 44-G-298, and 44- C-402 (henceforth ref erred to as the \"subject property \") (Figure s 1 and 2 ). The subject property contains the former SCIP facility , which includes approximately 43 structures across 17 parcels totaling approximately 20 acres adjacent to the eastern bank of the Ohio River northwest of downtown Pittsburgh (Figure s 1 and 2). The former SCIP facility operated as a medium -security prison since its original construction in the late 1800's until it was temporarily closed by the PA Department of Corrections ( PADOC) in approximately 2005. The SCIP facility reopened in 2007 and operated until it was permanently closed by the PADOC in June 2017 and has been vacant since. The SCIP facility includes prison wards, auditorium, dining hall, gymnasium, hospital, library, power p lant, industrial shops, administrative buildings, former warden's residence, enclosed courtyards, and various support and maintenance buildings. Concrete, asphalt, and grassy access roads, walkways, parking areas, and recreational areas are dispersed betwe en the buildings. Storm drains are present in the concrete - and asphalt -paved areas throughout the subject property. The secure area of the subject property is contained by the Main Penitentiary Building to the west and an approximately 25 -foot-high sand stone block and cast concrete wall to the north, east, and south. Construction of the SCIP facility began in 1878 with the construction of the main prison ward with the final permanent structures added in 1994. Additional temporary buildings were added in 2007 when the SCIP facility was reopened. The subject property is bound to the north by West hall Street, followed by industrial and commercial properties; to the south by Doerr Street, followed by industrial and commercial properties ; to the east by Beaver Avenue, followed by commercial properties and railroad tracks ; and to the west by the Three Rivers Heritage Trail, followed by the Ohio River. Ownership records indicate that, of the 17 parcels that comprise the subject property, 13 parcels are owned by the Commonwealth of PA . According to the SCIP property boundary survey completed by Pedersen & Pedersen, Inc. (P&P) in 2017, parcels 44 - C-122, 44 -C-68, 44 -G-298, and 44 -C-402 are owned by the PA Department of Transportation (PennDOT), the PA Department of Property and Supplies, the Allegheny County Industrial Development Authority , and the General State Authority , respectively ; however, at the direction of the PA Department of General T/Clients/ Baker /2390/Reports/R 3 ii Serv ices (PADGS), Rhea assumes that these parcels are currently owned by the Commonwealth of PA . According to the City of Pittsburgh Department of City Planning zoning map, the subject property is located in the Riverfront -General Industrial (RIV -GI) zoning di strict, which is designated for general industrial uses, as well as heavier industrial uses that may produce external impacts. This Phase I ESA was performed in accordance with the practices described in American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) E1527 -13 and the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA's) Standards and Practices for All Appropriate Inquiries (AAI) (40 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] Part 312) for PADGS to support the determination of the highest and best use of the subject property for future use. The objective of this Phase I ESA is to identify Recognized Environmental Conditions (RECs) , historical RECs (HRECs), controlled RECs (CREC s), and business environmental risks (BERs) from on-site sources as well as to identify potential RECs from off -site sources that may adversely affect the determination of the highest and best use of the subject property . According to ASTM E1527 -13, a REC is defined as the presence or likely presence of any hazardous substances or petroleum products in, on, or at a property: (1) due to release to the environment; (2) under conditions indicative of a release to the environme nt; or (3) under conditions that pose a material threat of a future release to the environment. The term is not intended to include de minimis conditions that generally do not present a threat to human health or the environment and that generally would not be the subject of an enforcement action if brought to the attention of appropriate governmental agencies. Based on Rhea's historical and environmental records review, interviews, and visual observations made during the site reconnaissance, no CRECs were identified in connection with the subject property; however, four RECs, one HREC, two BERs, and six de minimis conditions were identified, which are discussed below. Based on Rhea's historical and environmental records review, interviews, and visual obse rvations made during the site reconnaissance, the following four RECs were identified on the subject property: + Based on our review of historical use information, the subject property has been used as a correctional facility since at least the mid 1880's a long with various support facilities, including hospitals, dining facilities, power plants, laundry facilities, industrial manufacturing facilities, and machine shops, among others. Operations at these facilities likely included the use of hazardous substa nces. As a result, the historic site use is considered a REC. T/Clients/ Baker /2390/Reports/R 3 iii + Based on a review of the available historic documentation, historic adjoining and surrounding property use is considered a REC due to the former presence of aboveground storage tanks ( ASTs ) containing solvents and electroplating operations to the north and south of the subject property, respectively, which have the potential to adversely impact the subject property. + According to Rhea 's Final Phase II ESA (Rhea, 2019) for the subject property , lead and manganese (soil) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE), arsenic, iron, and manganese (groundwater) concentrations were present above the applicable Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection ( PADEP ) Land Recycling Program Statewide Health Standar ds (Act 2 ) for a non -residential, used aquifer with less than or equal to 2,500 parts per million (ppm) total dissolved solids (TDS) . Lead and manganese were detected in soils above the applicable Act 2 standard at four locations. PCE was detected in groundwater above the applicable Act 2 standard in one location while metals were detected above Act 2 standards in all eight sample locati ons. The known soil and groundwater concentrations above applicable Act 2 standards on the subject property is considered a REC. + A large coal storage area was observed along the eastern exterior of Buildings 27 and 27A (Figure 2) . The coal is no longer us ed and has likely been in this location since at least 2005, when the SCIP power plant was converted from coal to natural gas. Leachate emanating from coal storage areas can impact soil and groundwater; therefore, the coal storage area is considered a REC. The subject property is listed in the leaking underground storage tank ( LUST ) database for a release that occurred in November 1997. According to the database listing, the LUST case has a \"Cleanup Completed\" status as of October 19, 2011, indicating tha t it has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority (PADEP). Because the LUST case has been addressed to the satisfaction of the PADEP without subjecting the property to any required controls, as evidenced by the lack of Activity and Use Limitations ( AULs ), it is considered a HREC. Based on Rhea's historical and environmental records review, interviews, and visual observations made during the site reconnaissance, the following two BERs were identified on the subject property : + Based on a review of the available supplemental physical setting resources, the subject property is located in the 100 -year and 500 -year T/Clients/ Baker /2390/Reports/R 3 iv floodplain. The location of the subject property within the 100 -year and 500-year floodplain is considered a BER as the presence of the floodplains may require additional development and building costs. + Rhea observed one 2,500 -gallon diesel underground storage tank ( UST ), one 6,000 -gallon gasoline UST, and one 8,000 -gallon diesel UST on the subject property. According to Justin Moore , PADOC's Safety Manager , the USTs have been emptied and currently have a \"temporarily out of use\" status as of February 2020. The USTs are set to be closed and removed in November 2022 (Interview). The USTs are considered a BER as any poten tial contamination discovered during the removal of the tanks could lead to additional investigation and/or cleanup costs. Based on Rhea's historical and environmental records review, interviews, and visual observations made during the site reconnaissance , the following six de minimis conditions were identified on the subject property. According to ASTM E1527 -13, de minimis environmental conditions are conditions that \" generally do not present a threat to human health or the environment and that generally would not be the subject of an enforcement action if brought to the attention of appropriate governmental agencies. \" + Rhea observed empty drums in Buildings 29 and 43, drums containing soap concentrate in Buildings 11 and 18, and a drum containing an oily - water mixture in Building 35. The drums located within the buildings on the subject property are unlikely to have adversely impacted the subject property are considered a de minimis condition. + Minor oil staining was observed on t he interior of Buildings 11, 12, 24, 26, 28, 29, 32, and 35. The oil staining is generally limited to discrete areas within the buildings. The minor oil staining is unlikely to have adversely impacted the subject property and is considered a de minimis condition. + Rhea observed furniture, equipment, machinery, tools, maintenance supplies, and various surplus items and debris throughout the buildings on the subject property that were abandoned when the SCIP closed in 2017. The solid waste and debris observe d within the buildings on the subject property is unlikely to have adversely impacted the subject property and is considered a de minimis condition. + Rhea observed additional abandoned equipment throughout the subject property, including diesel generators, shoe repair equipment, industrial ovens, industrial sheet metal cutting equipment, grease trap, forklift, x - ray machine, machine shop equipment, and portable pumps and T/Clients/ Baker /2390/Reports/R 3 v generators. The abandoned equipment observed within the buildings on the subject proper ty is unlikely to have adversely impacted the subject property is considered a de minimis condition. + Rhea observed several empty 55 -gallon rusted metal drums on the exterior of Buildings 23, 24, and 36. The rusted metal drums are unlikely to have adversely impacted the subject property and are considered a de minimis condition. + An area of solid waste debris, including metal and plastic fencing, tires, pallets, and maintenance equipment was observed to the east of Building 24 (Figure 2) . The solid waste debris located west of Building 24 is unlikely to have adversely impacted the subject property and is considered a de minimis condition. Based on these fi ndings, Rhea believes that a Phase II ESA is warranted to conclusively determine the subsurface environmental conditions of the subject property. Rhea recommends that the Phase II ESA include onsite intrusive sampling activities to properly characterize th e surface/subsurface soil and groundwater conditions. Intrusive sampling activities should include the advancement of soil borings and groundwater monitoring wells throughout the subject property. According to the previous Phase II ESA completed for the su bject property (Rhea, 2019), semi and furans were not detected in soil or groundwater above Act 2 standards; however, metals were det ected above Act 2 standards in both soil and groundwater and volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ) were detected above Act 2 standards in groundwater. As a result, soil and groundwater samples should be submitted for laboratory analysis of VOCs and metals. Relevant services beyond the scope of ASTM Standard E1527 -13 such as asbestos - containing materials (ACM), lead-based paint ( LBP), radon, and mold were not evaluated by Rhea as part of this Phase I ESA. However, i t should be noted that Michael Baker Internat ional ( MBI) and Rhea will be conducting an ACM survey of the buildings on the subject property as part of a separate project task. A discussion of the work performed and results of the ACM survey will be provided to PADGS under separate cover. Additionally , Rhea observed evidence of mold and LBP in several buildings during the site reconnaissance. Based on the observations made during the site reconnaissance and the age of the subject property, it is likely that mold and LBP are present within the buildings and structures on the subject property. Rhea recommends that the Phase II ESA include a mold and LBP investigation. T/Clients/ Baker /2390/Reports/R 3 vi Rhea recommends the following regarding the identified de minimis conditions: + The areas of oil staining on the interior of Buildings 11, 12, 24, 26, 28, 29, 32, and 35 should be located and addressed prior to any demolition or construction activities. + All drums, furniture, equipment, machinery, tools, maintenance supplies, surplus items, and debris should be removed and disposed of in accordance with applicable federal, state, and local regulations. FINAL PHASE II ENVIRONMENTAL SITE ASSESSMENT STATE CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION - PITTSBURGH LAND USE FEASIBILITY STUDY 3001 BEAVER AVENUE PITTSBURGH , PENNSYLVANIA 1 5233 Project No. 2390 February 1 7, 2023 Prepared for: Pennsylvania Depar tment of General Services - Bureau of Real Estate 505 North Office Building Harrisburg, Pennsylvania 171 25 Prepared by: Rhea Engineers and Consultants, Inc. 333 Rouser Road, Suite 301 Moon Township, Pennsylvania 15108 /R5 & Consultants, Inc. (Rhea) completed a Phase II Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) at the State Correctional Institution (SCI) - Pittsburgh facility (henceforth referred to as \" subject property \") located at 3001 Beaver Avenue in Pittsburgh , Pennsylv ania ( PA) in support of potential future development activities . The subject property currently contai ns the vacant SCI - Pittsburgh facility, which contains approximately 43 structures and comprises 17 parcels across approximately 2 0 acres along the easte rn ban k of the Ohio River, n orthwest of downtown Pittsburgh. A Phase I ESA was completed at the subject property in September 20 22 by Rhea . The Phase I ESA identified Recognized Environmental Conditions (RECs) on and in proximity to the subject property. Based on these RECs, a Phas e II ESA involving surface/subsur face s oil sampling and groundwater sampling was recommended to characterize the environmental conditions present at the subject property. This Phase II ESA was performed in accor dance with Ameri can Society for Testing and General Services (PADGS) to support t he determination of the highest a nd best use of the subject p roperty. Between January 11 and January 16, 2023, Rhea conducted a subsurface investigation which included the advancement of 1 2 soil borings (SB -01 through SB -12) and 12 temporary monitor ing we lls (MW-01 through MW -12). Soil Media Two soil samples were collected at each soil boring location and analyzed for volatile organ ic compoun ds (VOCs), Target Analyte List micrograms per liter [\u00b5g/L]) at a concentration above the Pennsylvania Department of Environme ntal Protection (PADEP) Land Recycling Program N on-Residential Statewide Health Standard (Act 2) standard (2,000 \u00b5g/L). The presen ce of manganese is likely a re sult of natural processes as manganese is naturally occurring in rock and soil. The remaining soil sa mples collected d uring the subsurface investigation did not contain metals , incl uding trivalent or hexavalent chromium, above their respective Ac t 2 stand ards. Additionally, none of the soil samples collected du ring the subsurface investigation contained V OCs above th eir respective Act 2 standard . Groundwater Media Groundwa ter samples were collected from twelve temporary monitoring wells and analyzed for VOCs, TAL metals, trivalent chromium, and hexavalent chromium . methyl in groun dwater. -06, and -07), (5 in located in the central p ortion of the subject property and well MW -03 (207 \u00b5g/L) located in the north/northeastern portion of the subject property . PCE impacts are often associated wit h dry-cleaning and metal degreasing activ ities, both of which have been documented at the subject property. PCE da ughter products c is-1,2-DCE (26.3 \u00b5g/L) and de tected in well MW -03, with TCE exceeding the applicable Act 2 standard (5 \u00b5g/L). Methyl acetate , toluene, and TCE were detected at other wells through out the site , but at concentratio ns below their respecti ve Act 2 sta ndards. Three metals (arsenic, iron, and manganese ) were detected in groun dwater sam ples at concentrations abov e their respective Act 2 standards. Arse nic exceeded the applicable Act 2 standard (10 \u00b5g/ L) in MW-10 (39 \u00b5g/L) and MW-11 (13 \u00b5g/L), located in the weste rn portion of the subject property. Iron a nd mangan ese concentrati ons exceeded t he applicable Act 2 sta ndard in four and six locatio ns, respective ly. The presen ce of arsenic in the groundwater may be related to naturally occurring condition s or may be related to the historic use of th e coal fired power plant at the subje ct property as arsenic is a by -produc t of coal ash. Manganese and i ron ar e natu rally occurring in groundwater and concentrations may not be indicative of environmental contamination. No other metals, including trivalent and hexavalent chromium , were detected above Act 2 standards in the groundwater s amples collected during the subsurface investigation. Indoor Air Quality The concentration of PCE in tions (MSC for Regulate d Subs tances in Groundwater u nder the Act 2 standard of 5 \u00b5g/L for both constituents . Since the groundwa ter concentration of PCE and TCE is greater than the MSC gw, there is potential for vapor intrusion into buildings on the subject property. Recommendati ons It is Rhea's profession al opinion that the previ ous industrial activitie s have not impacted site soils to an exten t that would adversely affect future ea rth-disturbing activities at the subject property. Due to the level of manganese above the Act 2 standard for soil at SB -11, Rhea recommends that a He alth and Safety Plan (HAS P) and a Soil Management Plan (SMP) be prepar ed in order to develop procedures to limit potential exposure to impacted soil during future earth -disturbing site prepar ation and constructio n activities. No additional actions or investigati ons are recommended at this time for si te soils. T/Clients /Baker /2390/Reports /R5 iii The HASP shou ld include appropriate health and safety procedures for sit e workers working within potentially impacted areas. The HASP should also pr ovide procedures to avoid exposure to subsurface contamin ation. If potentially contaminated soil s are planned to be trans ported, disposed of, or otherwise remediated, the site must abide by the pro visions set forth in the PADE P Residual Waste Management re gulations (25 Pa. Code Chapters 287 to 299). The purpos e of the SMP is to protect human health and the environment duri ng the handling and/or excavation of soil as part of the re development of th e subject property . The SMP s hall detail procedures to be f ollowed to ensure that manganese in soil is mana ged at the s ubject property to limit ex posure to workers and oth er receptors dur ing earth -disturbing activities. The SMP would also address proper handling, stockpiling and disposal of any soils in proposed c onstructio n areas, maintenance of subject proper ty grades, site surface water drainage/ management and documentat ion. Previous i ndustrial activities have likely impacted groundwate r on the subject property. Furthermor e, screening of VOC groundwater data in dicates po tential for vapor intrusion in any buildings located on the subject prop erty. To addres s the groundwater (VOCs and met als) and potential indoor a ir quality ( IAQ) impact s (VOCs), Rhea s amples be coll ected and an alyzed from areas surrounding M W-03 to confirm the presence of PCE and TCE, further delineate th e contamination plume, and to potenti ally identify its source. It should be noted that Rhea has sub mitted a proposal for recommended supplemental sampling activ ities to Michael Baker Inter national (MBI) for approval by PADGS ; + Evaluation of the vapor intrusion pathway may be warranted in the future for any existing buildings that are not planned for demolition. An evaluation of the vapor intrusion pa thway was not included in Rhea 's proposal for supplementa l sampling at this tim e since the plans for retention or demolition of buildings has not been decided . + Future site development plans will likely need to incorporate bo th Institu tional (deed restrictions on groundwater u se) and En gineering Controls (i.e., active or passive vapor mi tigation systems) to mitigat e impacts from groundwater contamination. DRAFT HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SURVEY STATE CORRECTIONA L INSTITUTION - PITTSBURGH LAND USE FEASIBILITY STUDY 3001 BEAVER AVENUE PITTSBURGH , PENNSYLVANIA 1 5233 Project No. 2390 February 28, 2023 Prepared for: Pennsylvania Depart ment of Gener al Services - Bureau of Real Estate 505 North Office Building Harrisburg, Pennsylvania 17125 Prepared by: Rhea Engineers and Consultants, Inc. 333 Rouser Road , 301 Moon Township , Pennsylvania 15108 Baker/2390/Repo rts/R2 i EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Introduction Pennsy lvania Department of General Services (PADGS) contracted Rhea Engineers & Consultants, Inc. (Rhea) and Michael Baker International, Inc. ( MBI) to perform an environme ntal and hazardous material survey of the 43 structures at the former State Correc tional Institution - Pittsb urgh (SCIP) property lo 3001 Beaver Ave nue, Pittsbur gh, PA 15233 (henceforth referred to as \"subject property \"). Environmental i nspection s were conducted throughout each structure located at the subject property . This report documents the surveys of each structure by a certified inspector for asbestos-containing mat erial (ACM), suspect ed lead- contain ing paint (LCP), and other potentially hazardous materials and/or universal wastes (UW). The survey was conducted from Novembe r 15, 2022 through December 7, 2022 by Rhea and MBI personnel. Laborat ory analysis of the bu lk material (for asbestos) was completed by EMSL Analytical, Inc. (EMSL) of West mont , New Jersey . Regulatory Background The United St ates Environmental Protection Agency ) and Commo nwealth of Penns ylvania define ACM as any material that contains greater than one percent asbestos. Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regula tions (CFR) , Part 61 (40 C FR 61), Subpart M (USEPA National Emissio n Standard s for Hazardous Air Pollutants [NESHAP] ) require s th at an asbestos ins pection be conducte d prior to renova tion/demolition activi ties. Commonwe alth of Penn sylvania also requires that asbesto s inspections be con ducted prior to renovation/demolition activities. The O ccupa tional Safety and Health Administratio n (OSHA) Lead Standar d (29 CFR 1926.62) is appl icable where paints that conta in any amount of l ead wil l be disturbed. OSHA considers a ll paint (since all pa int has some level of lead within it) as LCP. Thus, all of th e paint within the 43 struc tures s urve yed at SCIP is considered LC P. Summary of Findings and Reco mmendations The purpo se of this en vironmental study was to id entify hazardo us mate rials prior to the determination of the highest and best use of m ultiple st ructures at the subject property so th at proper procedures can be utilized to prevent potentia l hazards during future site de velopment activities . It is assumed that all hazardous T/Clients/ Baker/2390/Repo rts/R2 ii mater ials identified in this survey must be removed prior to future site dev elopment activities . The following table summarizes the identified hazardous materials within each structure: Build ing Num bers ACM Concern LCP Concern Other Hazards Concern 1 Yes Yes Yes 2 No Yes Yes 3 No Yes Yes 4 Yes Yes Yes 5 No Yes Yes 6 No Yes Yes 7 No Yes Yes 8 Yes Yes Yes 8A Yes Yes Yes 9 No Yes Yes 10 Yes Yes Yes 11 Yes Yes Yes 12 Yes Yes Yes 13 Yes Yes Yes 14 Yes Yes Yes 15 Yes Yes Yes 16 Yes Yes Yes 17 No Yes Yes 18 Yes Yes Yes 19 No Yes Yes 21 No Yes Yes 22 No Yes Yes 23 Yes Yes Yes 24 No Yes Yes 25 No Yes Yes 26 No Yes Yes 27 Yes Yes Yes T/Clients/ Baker/2390/Repo rts/R2 iii Build ing Num bers ACM Concern LCP Concern Other Hazards Concern 27A Yes Yes Yes 28 No Yes Yes 29 No Yes Yes 31 Yes Yes Yes 32 Yes Yes Yes 35 No Yes Yes 36 No Yes Yes 37 Yes Yes Yes 38 No Yes Yes 39 No Yes Yes 42 No Yes Yes 43 No Yes Yes The term \"other hazards \" refers to light bulbs and fixtures, thermostats, exi t signs, smoke detectors, mold, and air conditioning units that may contain hazardous materials requiri ng various controls for p roper handling or disposal. It shou ld be noted that an abandone d tunnel s ystem is located throughout the subject prope rty. Rhea and MBI personne l were not g ranted access to these tunnel s due to health and safety concerns related to their dilapidated condi tion. As a conservative approach, i t should be assum ed that ACM , LCP, and other hazards are prese nt within these areas. Asbes tos ACM was ident ified in 17 st ructures thr oughout the sub ject and a total 235 homogen eous suspe ct materials were identified , sampled, and submitted for analys is by EMSL . Thirty of the suspected materials were confirmed to be ACM by laboratory anal ysis and seven were assu med to be ACM due to previous documentation a nd labeling. All identifi ed ACM should be pro perly hand led when removed and disposed of a ccording to federal, state, and local regulations . The development of hazardous material abatement drawing s and specifications would be warr anted for the safe removal of the posit ively identified and p resumed ACM listed in Tabl e 1. It is also import ant to note that the \"positive stop approach \" was requested and implemen ted during this project . Using this approach , when laboratory identifies a T/Clients/ Baker/2390/Repo rts/R2 iv material as asbestos -containing, all other samples of the same material are not analyzed , under the assu mption that those ma terials are also asbestos -containing . Lead-Containing Paint (LCP) Based upon the age of the struc tures and the OSHA definition of LCP , all painted mate rials shou ld be class ified as LCP. No bulk paint samples w ere collected ; howeve r, general observations of the condition of the paint were d ocumented t o assist with the p otential project. Table 2 presents th e specif ic information for t he lead pa int. Numerous painted building comp onents were observ ed to be damaged and d eteriorated . While there is no abatemen t of paint pla nned, the contractor should be awar e of the LCP during the renova tion activities, s o that proper worker safety procedures can be implemented . The requirem ents of the OSHA Construction Standards nee d to be invoked if any metal content is pre sent in the paint th at may be a ffected by renovation activities. OSHA does not provide a mi nimum concentr ation criteria l evel for these metals; however, it requi res precauti ons and protection for workers and the w orking environment be taken at any workpla ce where exposur e to airbor ne m etals may occur. The contractor shall be respons ible for performing work a ccordi ng to all applicable fede ral, st ate, and local law s. Other Hazards Based upon the results of this investigation, the subject property conta ins other potentially hazardous materials and UW. Table 3 presents a summary of other hazards iden tified by Rhea and MBI during the investigation , further described below : + Water damage and/or mold p roblem s were observed within all struc tures located at the subject propert y. It should be noted that the potential for mold is present in each building , prim arily r elated to the deter ioration of roofing material causing water damage, which leads to mold . + Approximately 7,300 light bulbs were noted during the inspe ction. Though the buil dings appeared to have many newer lights, it is likely that older li ght bul bs exist in the building s. The original lighting system s have an elevated potential for mercury-containing florescent light bulbs and should be disp osed of accordance with the USEPA UW 40 CFR 273. + Approximately fixtur es were noted during the inspe ction. Though the build ings appeared to have many n ewer lights, there is a possibility that PCB-containing light ballasts exist in the buildings. Ballasts not specifically marked as \"non-PCB containing\" encounte red T/Clients/ Baker/2390/Repo rts/R2 v during future site dev elopment activities should be ma naged and disposed of in accordance with the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA ) Storage and Disposal Requirements for Fluorescent Light Ballasts. + Approximately 100 thermostats were noted during the inspe ction. The therm ostats are l ikely to contain mercury and shoul d be dispos ed of in accordance with the EPA UW Regulations 40 C FR 273. + Approximately 123 Exit signs were noted during inspection. Self-luminous Exit signs containing the radioactive gas, tritium, were historically used in a variety of facilities across the United States. Intact tritium Exit signs pose little or no threat to public health and safety and do not consti tute a security risk. However, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ( NRC) requires proper account ing and dispos al of all radioactive materials. Proper handling and accounting are important, because a damaged or brok en sign could cause minor radioactive contamination of the immediate vicin ity, requirin g a potentially expensive clean up. It is recommended that all Exit signs be collected intact and disposed of at a lic ensed recycling facility. + Approxi mately 45 smoke detectors were no ted du ring the inspection. The fire prot ection systems have an elevated poten tial to contain ionization type smoke and fire detectors that are typically constructed with an Americium-241 radioactive sour ce. If impacted by renovation / demo lition activities , the detectors should be segregated and disposed of prop erly in accordance with federal, state, and local regulations. Disclaimer The in formation present ed in this re port reflect s the condition s that w ere observed in all str uctures loca ted at the sub ject property during and MBI 's November /December 2022 inspection . Althou gh ever y effort was made to ide ntify all poten tial suspect build ing materials and/or paint , there is no gu arantee that additional materia ls are not presen t. Conditio ns may exist such that inacc essible materials may only become appar ent duri ng future renov ation o r demolition activities.

Clarifications & Assumptions Total Estimated Construction Cost (Base) : $43,756,446 Add Alternate 01: $ 3,899,161 Possible Salvage Value: $ (846,866 ) Project Description The scope of work consists of demolishing 42 structures , along with outbuilding, fencing, perimeter walls and towers, site lighting and all site utilities on the 21-acre property currently housing the abandoned State Correctional Inst itution Pittsburgh . The intent is to abate, clear, and grade the site to provide a construction ready property . An alternate has also been provided to include raising the elevation of the Industrial Use portion of the site above the flood plain. Basis of Design This opinion of probable construction cost has been developed based on information provided in the 2003 Biennial Survey, various hard copy As -Built drawings, and site observations made during Michael Baker's September 12, 2022, site walk. Any areas that were not accessible and/or not shown on existing drawings have been estimated using assumptions and the estimator's best professional judgement. Estimating Methodology This estimate has been prepared as a Class 4 estimate per the AACE International guidelines and based on the current level of design. Accuracy of the estimate ca n be expec ted to be within -15% to -30% on the low end and +20% to +50% given the complexities and unknowns associated with the project. Pricing and productivity are based on the RS Means 20 23 published Cost Data for the Pittsburgh area, along with historic pricing from similar past projects. Non -standard line items included as 'Lump Sum ' have been estimated with an assumed crew and duration rather than applying a unit cost . All work is assumed to utilize union labor forces, and/or prevailing rates . Wage rates are based on the latest Davis - Bacon wage determination for Allegheny County, PA. The project is assumed to be competitively bid to a single prime contractor. It is assumed that all work will take place during standard daylight hours . Contractor General Conditions are included as a percentage of construction . The project is assumed to have a construction duration of approximately 450 calendar days with a July 2025 start date. Project Mark -Ups 1. Sales Tax 7% 2. Esca lation is included at 18.15 % with an assumed mid -point of March 2026. 3. Owner SIOH is EXCLUDED 4. Force Account is EXCLUDED 5. A/E Design Fees have bee n included at 4% 6. CM Fees have been included at 5% Contractor Mark -Ups 1. Mobilization is included at 2% direct tota l. 2. Contractor Overhead is included at 5% 3. General Conditions are included at 7% 4. Permitting is included at $5 per $1,000 or construction/ demolition 5. Bonding is included at 1.5% 6. Prime Contractor Profit is included at 5% 7. Design/Estimating Contingency is included at 20% Clarifications & Assumptions 1. Michael Baker has no control over the cost of labor, materials, equipment, market escalation or deflation, contractors' or subcontractors' methods of determining prices, competi tive bidding or market conditions. Opinions of probable construction cost contained herein are made on the basis of Michael Baker's qualifications and experience. These opinions represent best judgments made on the basis of familiarity with the constructio n industry and experience as professional construction consultants. However, Michael Baker cannot and does not guarantee that bids, proposals, or construction cost will not vary from estimated costs . 2. At the time of this report the Hazardous Materials Abat ement survey has not been completed. All abatement pricing and assumptions have been included based on the 2003 site survey and visual field observations. The report is to be updated once the survey results are published. 3. Demolition methodology assumes a crew will work in each building prior to demolition to remove any salvageable materials and equipment. Once the structure is razed, any remaining structural steel or misc . metals will be sorted from the debris. 4. For this r eport the project has been sequenced so that demolition will start near Beaver Ave and progress towards the river . The existing perimeter wall will remain in place as long as possible to serve as a wind break and provide site security. Once all facilitie s have been demolished, the final phase will consist of removing pavements, site utilities, infilling tunnels and basements, and site grading. Actual means and methods are to be determined by the contractor of record . 5. All imported fill is assumed to be c lean, common earth. 6. Salvage pricing has been included in this opinion of probable cost. Unit costs are based on current local market conditions. Given the volatil ity of the scrap market this pricing is to serve as a general guide with the understanding that pricing at the time of bidding may vary greatly. 7. Alternate 01 includes pricing to import an average of 24\" of clean fill across the 16.5 acres of the site designated for industrial use . The intent is to bring the area above the flood plain. 8. Assumes the fuel island and underground storage tanks at the Northwest corner of the property will be removed and backfilled by others prior to starting demolition activities. 9. At the time of the site walk access was not available for various structures , most notably were the Front House, Power Plant, Sewage Pump House , and Guard Towers . Access was also not available to the substation located in Building 12. 10. Assumes the substation will be removed by others prior to demolition of the facility. 11. Scrap Steel, cell/ security equipment, and other salvage tonnages have been calculated using assumed weights per unit depending on the item. These tonnages are conceptual and are meant to provide the user an idea of potential salvage value. Actual tonnages may var y depending on what the bidding contractor determines to be salvageable. 7/18/22, 1:45 PM Pittsburgh, P A Code of Ordinances 1/36911.02. - Use Table.

View of the recently finished penitentiary from across the Ohio River, 1897.Summary Paragraph Western State Penitentiary is a former state prison that began operation in 1878. It is located on the east bank of the Ohio River in the Marshall-Shadeland neighborhood of Pittsburgh, approximately 2.5 miles downstream (or northwest) from \"The Point,\" where the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers meet to form the Ohio. The facility contains approximately 22.5 acres of land and operated as a correctional facility until it was closed in 2004-2005. In 2007, it reopened for a decade before being permanently closed in 2017. The former penitentiary contains a total of forty-two identified resources constructed between 1878 and ca. 2007. Of these, twenty-four buildings, structures and objects were built within the period of significance from 1878 to 1966 and contribute to the district's historic significance. Eighteen resources are non-contributing. Most of these were constructed after the period of significance, including eight small-scale modular units, trailers, and sheds installed upon the penitentiary's 2007 re-opening 2007 and have a provisional feel. The largest and most significant building is the Main Penitentiary Building, which was constructed between 1878 and 1893 and extends for over one thousand feet along the bank of the Ohio River (Figures 1 and 2; Photo 1). The building consists of two wings with a central rotunda, clad in stone and brick in the Romanesque style. It housed all inmates until 1989 when a pair of cast concrete buildings known as Housing Units A and B were completed in the yard behind the south wing. Other buildings that supported inmate and facilities needs include a dining hall, gymnasium, hospital, auditorium, library/chapel, power plant, correctional industries shops (where state license plates and other products were manufactured) and the Chateauesque Warden's Residence outside the prison walls facing the Ohio River. Despite alterations to individual buildings over more than a century of operation, Western State Penitentiary possesses integrity of location, setting, design, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association.

The site is roughly rectangular and is bounded by Wes-thall Street to the north, Preble and Beaver* Avenues to the east, Doerr Street to the south, and the Ohio River to the west. Adjacent blocks are dominated by large industrial, warehouse and office uses, mostly one story in height. The majority of the site not covered by buildings has been paved. Trees are located only at the river's edge, along Beaver Avenue and the eastern part of Doerr Street and in the Visitors Courtyard. From the river's edge to Beaver Avenue, the land slopes gradually up to the east, gaining approximately eight feet in altitude. The site contains approximately 22.5 acres and is divided into three main areas: Historic Front Yard\u20146 Acres Located on the western side of the site, the Historic Front Yard of the penitentiary contains roughly six acres of flat flood plain approximately eight feet above the water line. The yard extends from the river to the front fa\u00e7ade of the Main Penitentiary Building (2, 3, 4), which was designed by Edward M. Butz and constructed between 1878 and 1893. Set back roughly two hundred feet from the river, the imposing ashlar-faced Romanesque fa\u00e7ade measures over one thousand feet wide and over sixty feet high. Immediately in front, on the central axis, is the large, 4-1/2-story stone Front House, or historic Warden's Residence and Offices (1). It was completed in 1885 and also designed by Butz (in a more Chateauesque style). For the first century of operation, prisoners arrived at the penitentiary via the Historic Front Yard and disembarked in a two-story porte cochere . On the ground level, prisoners would be transferred to the Operations Building, or historic Rotunda (4). The second floor served as a bridge that connected the Front House to the Rotunda.Building Names Buildings are generally introduced by recent names used by SCI-Pittsburgh staff, followed by historic names. Building Numbers Building numbers are those used by SCI and posted clearly on walls and roofs of most buildings to aid outsiders in identifying locations (e.g., if local emergency responders were called to the site). Throughout the text, building numbers follow building names in parentheses. Photographs Unless noted otherwise, all photographs of existing conditions were created by Matthew Christopher of Abandoned America. Photo 2.

Maintenance Storage Building (32), looking east, showing typical building designations used on walls and roofs (Google). * While the formal address for the facility is 3001 New Beaver Avenue, most maps (and local usage) omit \"New.\" As a result, this nomination utilizes \"Beaver Avenue\" throughout the narrative sections. Section 7 Page 9United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania At the northwest corner of the Front Yard is the Westhall Street Launch\u2014a public river access point for kayakers and canoers. At the southwest corner a ramp and stone steps lead down to a series of concrete pads at the river's edge designated by a stone marker as The Woods Run Fishing Club. Adjacent to the river is the Three Rivers Heritage Trail (originally the right-of-way of the Pittsburgh & Western Railroad), a paved recreation trail which affords views of Brunot's Island and the Borough of McKees Rocks to the west. Bordering the eastern edge of the trail is a historic iron fence (ca. 1893) that returns to enclose a paved parking lot with access from Westhall and Doerr Streets. On the north and west sides are historic wrought iron pedestrian gates supported on cast iron posts; a more modern vehicular gate provides access on the south side. Two sets of modern chain link gates provide vehicular access at the north end of the parking lot. A grass lawn abuts the north end of the Main Penitentiary Building (2, 3, 4), while a paved recreation yard for inmates of Housing Units C and D (ca. 2007) abuts the south end and is bounded by double rows of razor wire. In the lawn to the north of the Front House is a single-story Storage Building (24), which was constructed of cast concrete around 1930 as the garage for the Warden's House; it was enlarged by a concrete block addition to the north in the around 1940. To its north is a bulb-shaped water tower constructed in 1966, which replaced the water tower inside the prison walls that was scaled by rioting prisoners in 1962. North of the water tower is the single-story Vehicle Maintenance Building (35), designed by CRA-BKA-NHA (joint venture) and constructed in 1993. To its northwest, tucked inside the corner of the iron fence, is the Art Deco Sewage Pump House (31), designed by Morris Knowles Company and completed in 1941. It contains one story above grade and three that extend underground below the river level. To the southwest of the Front House, on the edge of the parking lot, is an octagonal one-story Guard Station (22), which was constructed ca. 1934 and originally served as the Outside Pump House. Photo 3. The Wood's Run Fishing Club's dock at the southwest corner of the property, looking north. Section 7 Page 10United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania A number of minor structures dating from ca. 2007 are scattered across the Front Yard and include Modular Building (37) across from the Front House, Tower 8 in the parking lot overlooking Recreation Yard C/D, a Mail Trailer at the south end of the Main Penitentiary Building, and small sheds adjacent to the Guard Station and Sewage Pump House. Secure Perimeter\u201411.5 Acres Located in the center of the site, the Secure Perimeter contains roughly 11.5 acres of densely packed buildings bounded on the west by (and including) the Main Penitentiary Building and bounded on the north, east and south by a perimeter wall of stone and concrete. The wall measures twenty-five feet high, three feet thick at its top, and four feet thick at its base (which extends approximately eight feet below ground level). Atop the wall is a railed walkway that connects to six observation towers at strategic corners. Butz designed the wall as part of his vision for the original facility. The north wall and northern end of the east wall are constructed of Massillon sandstone block and were finished by 1883. The south wall and southern end of the east wall, also of Massillon sandstone, were completed by 1893. The remainder of the east wall is cast concrete and was constructed in 1932 as part of an expansion of the penitentiary grounds. The Auditorium/Dietary Storage Building (8/8A) is located on the center axis of the Main Penitentiary Building and essentially divides the Secure Perimeter in two. Constructed of brick, the Auditorium portion is one story in height, while the attached storeroom contains two floors. This building and most of the buildings to its north date from 1922 and are replacements for buildings destroyed by fires set by rioting prisoners in July of 1921. The largest building in this part of the campus is the Correctional Industries Shop Building (11, 12, 13) once used for inmate labor, which was originally constructed as three separate single-story sheds of steel plate sidewalls and clerestory roofs. They were joined in the 1950s to create one large inter-connected space. Between the Correctional Industries Shop Building and the Auditorium/Dietary Storage Building is a large grass lawn for inmate recreation. The largest green space within the secure perimeter, the lawn is bounded on its east side by the one-story Services Building (10), which is also of brick and steel shed construction and also dates from 1922. Just east of the Services Building is the Photo 4. Grass yard north of the Auditorium, looking northeast, showing the Correctional Industries Shop Building (left) and the Services Building (right). Section 7 Page 11United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania two-story brick Library, Chapel and Education Building (18), designed by Charles M. & Edward Stotz, Jr., and constructed in 1954. In the northwest corner is a paved Recreation Yard for inmates in Housing Units E and F. To the south is the Main Yard, the largest paved recreation area at the penitentiary. On its western edge is the small, one-story Inside Pump House (21) from 1934. Further south are the newest inmate housing buildings\u2014the nearly identical, six-story, concrete block Housing Unit A (5) and Housing Unit B (6), both designed by Tasso Katselas Associates and Henningson, Durham & Richardson (joint venture, a.k.a. TKA/HDR) constructed in 1989. On the southwest side of the former is a Recreation Yard for inmates of Housing Units A and B; on the west side of the latter is an open Exercise Pavilion (19), ca. 2007. The east side of the Main Yard is bounded by a series of buildings from the 1930s, that includes the single-story Dining Hall (15) designed by Harry Viehman and constructed in 1931 (with a south addition in 1957 designed by Charles M. and Edward Stotz, Jr.); one-story brick Gymnasium (16) built ca. 1900 and enlarged in 1939; and Maintenance Building (17), ca. 1900, with later modifications. The eastern edge of the Secure Perimeter was expanded in the 1930s in order to place critical infrastructure as high above historic water levels as possible. Completed in 1939 were a new Boiler Plant/Power House (27/27A), Maintenance Shops/Offices (14, 23, 28, 29) and a hospital designed by Theodore Eichholz and Harry Viehman. The latter was subsequently replaced by the three-story, brick, Health Services Building (26) designed by Roach Walfish Lettrich, completed in 1994. During recent operation of the facility, there were two main access points into the secure perimeter. Vehicular access was provided through the Sally Port (enlarged ca. 1951) in the southeast corner of the perimeter wall. Here, a vehicle would pass through the first gate and stop at a Guard Station (ca. 2007). After inspection by penitentiary staff, it would be allowed to proceed through the Photo 5. South end of the Secure Perimeter, looking southeast from the roof of the Rotunda, showing the Main Yard (center). Section 7 Page 12United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania second gate. Just north of the Sally Port is the Scale House, dating from ca. 1984. A second vehicular access point existed in the northwest corner of the perimeter wall adjacent to the Main Penitentiary Building. However, the opening has been filled with steel plates and masonry (which appears from photographs to have occurred as early as 1921). Primary pedestrian access during recent operations was via the Administration Building and Visitors Complex (7), which took on many of the inmate processing and visitation functions that originally occurred in the Warden's Residence and Office Building and Rotunda\u2014effectively flipping the front fa\u00e7ade of the facility from the river side to Beaver Avenue. Throughout the Secure Perimeter, fences and gates of razor wire crisscross the site to create secure, manageable spaces and provide controlled access. New Front Yard\u20145 Acres Located on the eastern side of the site, the New Front Yard of the penitentiary contains roughly five acres of flat land that extends from the perimeter wall east to Preble and Beaver Avenues. This area contained blocks of dense residential buildings dating from the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries that were largely razed and redeveloped as part of 1960s-70s urban redevelopment work and a 1984 master plan for the penitentiary. The current alignments of Preble and Beaver Avenues date from the time of this plan. The Main Parking Lot on the corner of Beaver Avenue and Doerr Street dominates the New Front Yard and accommodates the re-orientation of the facility from its historic river side entrance. The parking lot provides visitor access to the two-story concrete block Administration Building and Visitors Complex (7) designed by TKA/HDR and completed in 1985. A Visitors Courtyard (41) on the south side of the building allowed for meetings in a secure, outdoor, landscaped space. Photo 6.

Section 7 Page 13United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania The north side of the Main Parking Lot also provides access to the one-story concrete block Institution Warehouse (9), designed by TKA/HDR and completed in 1985. One of the goals of its construction was to provide loading and storage outside the secure perimeter so that the movement of supplies into the penitentiary could be better controlled. At its north end is a walled Mechanical/Electrical Equipment Yard (40). Near the southwest corner of the Institution Warehouse is a modular building that served as Staff Lockers/Wellness Center (42), dating from ca. 2007. In the northeast corner of the New Front Yard is the North Parking Lot, site of the former Roberta Lang Parklet and Swimming Pool. The pool was constructed in 1927 and closed sixty years later. On the eastern edge of the lot is the Maintenance Storage Building (32), ca. 1927\u2014originally the filter house for the pool complex. On the south side of the lot, abutting the penitentiary wall is the Corrections Emergency Response Trailer (CERT), ca. 2007. The western edge of the lot once contained a house designated as the Warden's Chauffeur's Residence (demolished ca. 1960). Parcels The site bounded by Westhall and Doerr Streets, Preble and Beaver Avenues and the Ohio River consists of sixteen tax parcels owned by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's Department of General Services.

Like the Main Penitentiary Building just a dozen feet behind it, the massing of the Front House is wide when viewed from the river, but rather narrow when viewed from the side. The building measures approximately 88-feet wide by 43-feet deep by 58-feet high. From any angle, the Front House has a strong sense of verticality resulting from what normally would be the basement having been designed at grade since the house is built in a flood plain. Verticality is further emphasized by the steeply pitched, hexagonal hipped slate roof with multiple cross gables and dormers and by prominent (though now foreshortened) end chimneys, which form part of octagonal bays on the north and south ends of each floor. Copper flashing remains on the roof as do parts of three decorative copper finials. The front facade is three bays wide. In the center is an engaged octagonal tower. To its north on the first floor level is an enclosed one-story solarium with an open arcade below. The solarium is covered by a hipped standing seam metal roof. Above, a gabled wall dormer rises beyond the roof line. South of the tower Location map Photo 7.

Warden's Residence, north facade, looking south, showing the narrow gap between the house and the Main Penitentiary Building. Also visible is one of the three-story, octagonal bay windows with integral end chimney.is an open one-story porch (with temporary corrugated fiberglass panels inserted into the openings) also covered by a hipped standing seam metal roof. Above is a small gabled dormer with a wooden verge board decorated with trefoil patterns. Both of these structures were added in the mid-twentieth century. On all facades, stone belt courses delineate floor levels. On the east facade, the shadow of the former porte cochere and bridge are clearly visible. This structure was removed sometime after 1983 and little patching was done to conceal its former presence. Photographs show that it contained a large stone arched opening on its north and south facades along with large ornate wrought iron gates that acted as a sally port. Most window sashes throughout the building are missing or extremely damaged. Those that remain are wood, one-over-one, double-hung sashes. Historic photographs indicate that this one-over-one configuration was original. Window openings have stone lintels and sills. There is currently no access to the building from the front facade. However, historic drawings and photographs show that there were originally two front entrances: one for guests to the residence via a small porch where the solarium is today; and one for staff and people having business at the penitentiary via a small porch where the large open porch is located. Building Style While the the Front House is similar in style and materials to the Main Penitentiary Building and both were designed by Butz, the former lacks any of the round-arched details so prevalent on the latter and so common to the Romanesque style. In many ways the Front House is Chateauesque, a style loosely based on monumental 16th-century chateaus of France, which combined earlier Gothic elements with that century's increasingly fashionable trend toward Figure 9. Warden's Residence looking southeast, showing the stair to the family quarters, center, and stair to the penitentiary offices, right, (from E.M. Butz Birdseye view), 1883. Photo 8.

Front House (Warden's Residence)1 Section 7 Page 17United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Renaissance detailing. The style was popularized in the United States by Richard Morris Hunt, the first American architect to study at France's prestigious Ecole des Beaux-Arts. Upon Hunt's return, he advocated similar buildings for his wealthy clients. Among these were the Vanderbilts, for whom he designed several Chateauesque houses, culminating in Biltmore, George W. Vanderbilt's North Carolina country house completed in 1895. 3 The Chateauesque style was almost always architect-designed and was intended to impress. It typically featured massive masonry construction, steeply pitched roofs with many vertical elements (spires, finials, shaped chimneys), multiple dormers (especially wall dormers extending through the cornice line), towers, belt courses, and elaborate, expensive detailing. Not surprisingly, a number of Chateauesque style houses were built in Pittsburgh, with the most famous perhaps being Clayton, the home of industrialist Henry Clay Frick (remodeled in the Chateauesque style by architect Andrew Peebles in 1881, with further alterations by Frederick J. Osterling in 1892). Another example is the Willock House at 705 Brighton Road in the Allegheny West neighborhood on the Northside; designed by William Ross Proctor and completed in 1891. Interior of the Warden's Residence In plan, the building is roughly T-shaped, consisting of rooms in and adjacent to the projecting tower at the front, with a block of adjacent spaces running across the rear. Audits of the penitentiary from 1908 along with the original first floor plan from Butz from 1883 help explain original uses of each floor: Ground floor: Coachman's room; back cellar; breakfast room; ice room; kitchen and pantry; finished hall (providing access to the porte cochere and public stairs). All with tile floor, except for wood in the hall. First floor (shown on next page): Parlor; hall (vestibules and stairs); library; reception room; dining room and pantry. The building was served by three staircases: one in the public hall; one in the private hall for family use, and one in the pantry for servants. Second floor: Inspector's room; hall and store room; three bedrooms; and bath room. Third floor: Hallway; south bedroom; bath room; guest bedroom and bath; bedroom and dressing room. Attic: Maid's room; store room; hall. While access to the house for the current study was limited, it appears that the plan of rooms remains largely the same. However, two noteworthy alterations have occurred. First, significant amounts of interior trim have been removed from the house (following the 2005 closing of the facility), including most fireplace mantels, balustrades, much of the window and door trim, and the entire U-shaped private staircase that originally served the the residence. Second, a number of large murals have been painted on walls throughout the building.

M. Butz was born in Allegheny City around 1845-46. However, all published obituaries erroneously list his age at time of death as fifty-seven (i.e., born around 1859). The 1859 birth year is implausible based on known milestones throughout his career. For example, there are articles that indicate his career was underway in the early 1870s (which would have made him about thirteen) and that he began designing the Penitentiary in 1876 (which would have made him seventeen). A more accurate date of birth can be derived from the 1870 US Census, which indicates that Butz was twenty-four years old then and working as an architect (i.e, born in either 1845 or 1846). This would place his age at time of death around seventy. In addition to the Western Penitentiary, his noted designs include the the Tradesmen's Industrial Institute, the State Reform School at Morganza (successor to the House of Refuge), courthouses for Clarion and Westmoreland Counties, the Lawrence County Jail in New Castle, a Masonic Temple in Chicago, and a power station in New York City. It was his success with large commissions such as the Tradesmen's Industrial Institute and the buildings at Morganza that prompted the Board of Inspectors of the Penitentiary to hire him. In addition to being an architect, Butz was the founder of the Columbia Iron & Steel Company and was the holder of a number of patents for structural steel elements and fireproof construction. He married Mary Yeager of Allegheny City in 1876 and the couple had three children. Figure 14. Rendering of the Clarion County Courthouse (1885).

Constructed of brick with an ashlar sandstone face (except for the east facade of brick), the building measures 1,025 feet wide by 64 feet deep by approximately 60 feet high. The Rotunda is an octagon in the center measuring 90 feet square. The building was designed by Butz in the Romanesque style and originally fea- tured elaborate, steeply pitched roofs and turrets that visually divided the great width of the building into a series of pavilions\u2014two for each wing\u2014with the Rotunda rising in the middle to a height of over 120 feet. All features above the main cornice were removed in 1959 (due to inadequate maintenance and leaks) Location map2 34 Figure 18.

Today, the engaged octagonal bases of the turrets remain and divide the north and south wings into four bays on each side of the Rotunda. Each bay contains a series of tall arched windows covered with bars\u2014three windows in each of the two smaller bays and eleven in each larger bay (for a total of fifty-six windows on each of the long facades). Windows openings generally measure 6-1/2 feet wide by 35 feet tall and contain multi-lite industrial steel sash windows with six operable hopper windows per opening. The current windows date from ca. 1937 and originally contained mechanical openers that could be operated from the floor inside each wing. Those devices have been removed and windows are now opened or closed by a person suspended from an overhead hoist. Three similar windows are located on the north and south facades. The window openings are uninterrupted by interior floors, which are set back from the exterior walls. The chamfered walls of the Rotunda each contain two large, rectangular barred windows that start at the level of the first floor and rise to the same height as the adjacent arched windows. The base of the exterior walls are battered for a height of approximately seven feet. At this height, the north, west and south walls are 42 inches thick. The east wall, which lacks the ashlar facing, is 28 inches thick. Ten feet above the first floor line is a stone belt course, which also acts at the sill for each window. A similar belt course is present about thirty feet above the first one. At the cornice, encircling the building, is a band of heavily carved modillions. Atop the Rotunda is a cast concrete parapet (ca. 1959) that rises to a height of approximately three feet. Figure 19. This photo, taken after riots in 1953, shows the mechanical operators that allowed multiple sashes to be opened and closed from the floor (Pittsburgh Sun Telegraph).

As was typical in Auburn-style prisons, the cell blocks are set back from the exterior walls, which are constructed of brick. On the first floor, this set back area served as a narrow common area, or day room. On the east side, this area also contains guard stations with impact-resistant glass walls and ceilings and adjacent support and storage rooms of concrete block (ca. 1980). Theories about cell block design were evolving in the early years of Western Penitentiary, leading to the construction of larger cells when the South Wing was completed a decade after the North Wing. Specifically, the north wing has 640 cells: 540 of which measure five feet by eight feet in plan and 100 of which measure seven feet by eight feet. The south wing has 500 cells all measuring seven feet by eight feet. In both wings, cell walls are brick, measuring eighteen inches thick, and painted. Cell floors are limestone, which is also the case for the common areas on the first floor\u2014though large areas have been covered with a sealant and there are some areas of concrete patching. The balconies, or ranges, along the cell fronts are 37 inches deep with a four-pipe railing measuring 47 inches high. Each range is supported from below by decorative iron brackets. Extending about seven feet out from the lowest range is a ceiling of wire mesh intended to protect staff from objects thrown by prisoners from above. A typical cell contains a steel bed frame, desk with attached stool, shelf, locking cabinet, sink and toilet\u2014all bolted to the floor and/or walls. Some cells contain bunk beds. Larger cells originally contained a barred window looking out onto the range and the windows of the outer wall beyond. However, these were filled Main Penitentiary Building 2 3 4 Frederick C. Sauer (1860-1942) Born in Heidelberg, Germany, Frederick C. Sauer worked as a stonecutter, carpenter, and bricklayer for three years before studying architecture at the Stuttgart Technical School. After graduating in 1879, Sauer emigrated to Pittsburgh. Among his early employers was E.M. Butz who entrusted Sauer to supervise parts of the work at the new Western Penitentiary. By 1884 Sauer had established his own office from which he designed dozens of churches in the area. Among his notable works are St. Stanislaus Kostka Church (1891) in the Strip District, St. Mary of the Mount Church (1896) on Mount Washington, Saint Mary Magdalene Church in Homestead (1895), Latimer School (1898) in East Allegheny, and the St. Nicholas Croatian Church in Millvale (1922). In 1898, Sauer built a home for himself in Aspinwall and gradually transformed a wooded hillside into an architectural fantasy with a complex of castlesque buildings to which he progressively added until his death in 1942.

At the same time, the cell doors, which were originally made of open iron bars were replaced by solid, steel-plated, automatic sliding doors with two small wire mesh openings that could be operated from a guard station in each housing unit. During this same time period the single cell blocks in each wing (which measure over 450 feet in length) were partitioned into two more manageable housing units (i.e., C/D in the South Wing and E/F in the North Wing). Accompanying the latter change was the installation of stainless steel shower stalls (either at partitions or end walls) to accommodate hygiene needs within the now smaller housing units. Vertical circulation to the five tiers within each cell block is provided by open steel stairs containing stringers marked \"Carnegie,\" indicating they were provided by Pittsburgh's Carnegie Steel Company. Stairs are protected by single pipe rails that terminate into ornate cast iron newel posts.Main Penitentiary Building 2 3 4 Photo 18.

Section 7 Page 30United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania The interior of the Rotunda is supported on 16 cast iron columns that are 14 inches in diameter and sheathed in ornamental cast iron casings. When first designed, there were only two floors (above the basement). The first floor, which originally contained a reception area and mess room, has a ceiling height of 17 feet (now obscured throughout by lay-in ceiling tiles). The second floor, which originally served as the guard room, originally had a ceiling height of approximately 35 feet. The height of the guard room was the same as the height of the bridge to the Warden's Residence and Offices as well as the third tier of cells in the adjacent wings. Iron grating on the north and south ends of the guard room allowed the guards to survey all five tiers for the entire length of each cell block. Following riots in 1953, prison reforms were enacted statewide. In 1959, the penitentiary formally became the State Correctional Institution at Pittsburgh and a diagnostic and classification center was mandated. To accommodate this new service, a third and fourth floor were added in the Rotunda (designed by the firm of Charles M. and Edward Stotz, Jr.). This was the first of a number of renovations that have left the Rotunda interior devoid of almost any visible historic features. Drywall partitions subdivide the first three floors into a warren of small spaces and corridors, all containing contemporary finishes. The fourth floor contains mechanical equipment set on a concrete floor. The cast iron columns and their ornate capitals remain (but they are are hidden above drop ceilings or out of public view on the top floor). A continuous basement extends beneath the Main Penitentiary Building and is used primarily to distribute utilities. In the North and South Wings, this takes the form of five long, parallel, brick-arched vaults. Beneath the Rotunda, a group of small solitary confinement cells remain. This was historically referred to as the \"hole\" or \"dungeon,\" where prisoners were sent for extreme isolation before the former women's cell block took on this function. The smallest of these cells measures less than eight feet by four feet and consists of a concrete floor and arched concrete ceiling, painted stone walls, a steel door at one end and an open doorway at the other (that originally contained a wood door according to historic accounts).Main Penitentiary Building 2 3 4 Photo 24.

Housing Unit A/Building 5 (right) and Housing Unit B/Building 6 (left), looking northeast from Tower 7, showing recreation yards in the foreground.5 Exterior One of the main outcomes of the 1984 master plan was construction of Housing Units A and B (or buildings 5 and 6). They were designed to remedy the problem with overcrowding that the penitentiary faced throughout the twentieth century. The original cells in the Main Penitentiary Building were designed to house one person, but were often cramped with multiple inmates. This overcrowding, inadequate staff-to-inmate ratio, and several riots contributed to major security concerns and calls for new thinking about inmate accommodations. As a result, Units A and B were designed to feature a vastly different cell block arrangement than the North and South Wings. Units A and B are nearly identical from the exterior and sit at an angle to the original South Wing. They are clad in rough faced concrete masonry units (CMUs) with a vertical score on each block (also known as single score grid 5/A6/B Section 7 Page 36United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Housing Units A and B6 Photo 29. Housing Unit B (6), looking south from the Main Yard.5 block)\u2014a common design element in many buildings designed by Tasso Katselas. Each unit is 6 stories high and roughly shaped like a figure \"8\" or hour glass with numerous angular bays. Windows are narrow horizontal or vertical openings fortified with security bars fastened to the exterior. Flat EPDM roofs cover both buildings and are set behind low parapets. An elaborate exterior stairway connects the two buildings in the middle. It is constructed of cast concrete sections supported on cast concrete posts. It is partially protected from the weather by an arched galvanized metal roof. Chain link fencing is attached to the sides to protect from falls. Interior Unit B contains 240 cells in 48-cell and 24-cell clusters. In the center of a typical floor with 48-cell clusters is a central core for administration, vertical circulation and utilities. To each side, but separated from one another, is a large day room for inmates. Surrounding each day room are two tiers of 24 cells. Stairs on three sides of the day room provide access between the tiers. Floors with 24-cell clusters are similar in plan, but contain only one tier of cells on the same floor level as the day room. The resulting number of cells adjacent to one another in Unit B is much smaller than in the North and South Wings, even after the latter were subdivided in the 1980s, so that security threats could be contained within a smaller area. Unit A has a somewhat similar plan. However, since it was designed to house high security inmates, clusters are smaller (sixteen cells in two tiers) and freedom of movement was designed to be more limited by additional locking doors and partitions of steel mesh. This is where inmates were sent for administrative segregation or disciplinary custody (i.e., segregation for the Tasso Katselas (b. 1927) Tasso Katselas founded TKA in 1956 and has served as its principal architect and planner. The firm is known for its large-scale, mid-century residential work as well as for its planning and facility design. Among the firm's most notable works is the Pittsburgh International Airport, which opened in 1992. Other projects include the Carnegie Science Center, Allegheny Community College, and St. Vincent Monastery and College Buildings. The firm has won numerous design awards, most notable being a finalist in the national competition for the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial in Washington, DC.

The Capital Case Unit was housed on the third floor, where prisoners on death row were confined. Individual cells in Units A and B are larger than those in the Main Penitentiary Building with typical cells measuring 79 square feet compared to 56 square feet for the largest in the older building. Each cell has its own window and contains similar furnishings and equipment as in the Main Penitentiary Building, but with locking cabinets bolted to the floor rather than attached to the wall. Day rooms in both buildings contain rectangular steel tables bolted to the floor with integral steel stools. Finishes throughout are simple, consisting of vinyl tile floors, painted walls, unfinished cast concrete columns and ceilings that are typically just the painted underside of the concrete deck above.

In the southwest corner, a CMU wall encloses the visitors' courtyard to the south. The original south wall fo the penitentiary serves as its west wall. Interior The interior is constructed of the same rough faced CMUs as the exterior. In plan, the first floor is divided into four main sections. The central section contains the main entrance followed by a sally port and central control room, or guards station. To the southeast is an administrative suite with offices, meetings rooms and storerooms. To the southwest is the visitor day room and enclosed landscaped courtyard. To the north are inmate processing rooms, with direct access to the secure vehicle entrance. Adjacent to the north stair tower is an elevator. The second floor extends above only the east half of the building and contains staff training and locker space to the south and mechanical room to the north. The western portion of the second floor is uncovered rooftop space. Finishes throughout are simple, consisting of vinyl tile floors, walls of CMU or painted drywall, and ceilings that are either painted drywall, lay-in tiles or the underside of the concrete deck above.

Auditorium/Dietary Storage Building, looking north from the Main Yard. Exterior The Auditorium/Dietary Supply Building consists of the remains of a once larger building. In the early days of the penitentiary, this was the site of the East Wing (originally part of the House of Refuge's east wing), which was connected to the Rotunda and housed the Chapel and Kitchen with a connecting ell containing the original Boiler House and Bake House. Most of this complex was burned to the ground in 1921 by rioting inmates. The present building was rebuilt on the same footprint in 1922, and likely incorporated some surviving sections of the original building, especially where it joined the Rotunda (newspaper accounts indicate that the west end of this wing survived the fires). A Sanborn map from 1926 indicates that the reconstructed building housed the same functions as its predecessor. Subsequent maps and aerial photographs indicate that the south end of the ell that contained the Boiler House and Bake Shop was removed sometime between 1983 and 1993, leaving the truncated ell that extends just a few feet to the south. The western connection to the Rotunda, which historically housed the prison library and contained an arched passageway for pedestrian movement, was removed sometime between 1993 and 2007. What remains is a single-story auditorium with a gable roof (Building 8, west end) and a two-story storage area (Building 8A, east end) that are not connected on the interior. Figure 30. A view from the Main Yard in 1905 looking northeast, showing the L-shaped East Wing (at left), which housed the Kitchen, the Boiler House with its ten smokestacks, and the Bake House.

The south facade is ten bays wide plus the adjacent blank wall of the removed ell (concrete block first story with brick in the gable). Bays seven and nine (counting from west to east, as seen in the photo above) contain doors to the auditorium with large transoms above. The remaining bays contain large rectangular openings with stone sills and steel beam lintels. The transoms and windows are all infilled with glass block that surrounds two aluminum hopper windows, one stacked over the other. Extending across the middle of bays three, four and five is a shed roof, beneath which banks of telephones were once located for use by inmates. At the base of bay eight is a set of concrete stairs to the basement. This stairway, and two similar ones on the north facade, provide the only egress to the basement, which extends only beneath the auditorium part of the building. The north facade is of similar design, but with fifteen bays that extend evenly across the entire facade. The first ten bays (again counting from west to east) mirror the door/window design of the ten bays on the south facade. Bays eleven and twelve have been filled with brick; bay thirteen contains mechanical equipment; and bays fourteen and fifteen contain original (or early) multi-lite, industrial, steel sash windows. The east facade (the primary facade of Building 8A) is six bays wide. From south to north, the first, fifth and sixth bays each contain a six-lite, wood awning window. The second bay contains a pair of hinge-folded doors (one hinges off the other, rather than both hinged from the side jambs) with each leaf containing four glass lites. The third bay has been filled with concrete block. The fourth bay contains a pair of wood, two-lite casement windows. A steel stair provides access to the second floor via a steel door. This floor contains five window openings. The three to the south have been filled with concrete block; the two to the north contain single sheets of plexiglas. In the brick gable is a pair of wood two-over-two, double-hung sash windows. The west facade, facing the Rotunda, is brick and contains three pairs of narrow steel doors at grade. The brick gable above contains a pair of window openings that have been filled with plywood. Figure 32. Western end of the Auditorium in 1962 when the building still connected to the Rotunda. Note the arched passageway that allowed inmates to be marched through the building to activities on the north end of the Secure Perimeter.

Auditorium interior, looking east, showing the raised stage (center) and control booth (right). Auditorium/Dietary Storage Building 88A Interior The interior of the auditorium contains a large open area for seating and multi- purpose events. Walls are brick to the tops of the doors, with painted plaster above. The ceiling of lay-in tiles is 20 feet high and is suspended from the bot- tom chord of the steel trusses that support the roof. At the east end is a raised stage with two-story control booth on its south end (for controlling audiovisual effects as well as prisoners). The front of the stage and the control booth are faced in mint green glazed brick, which is also used to clad the 1931 Dining Hall (15)\u2014suggesting a similar date for this interior alteration. The ground floor of Dietary Storage (8A) contains two utilitarian storerooms with concrete floors, brick walls and arched concrete vaults overhead. The second floor contains two additional storerooms, also with concrete floors and brick walls. Overhead, the ceiling is open and the steel roof trusses and wood slat roof deck are visible.

Located outside the Secure Perimeter on the eastern side of the site, the warehouse was constructed to better control the movement of goods into the secure area. The Warehouse is a one-story space, though it is the same height as the nearby two-story Administration and Visitors Complex and adjacent east wall of the penitentiary. Like all of TKA's buildings at the penitentiary, it is clad with rough faced concrete masonry units with a vertical score on the face. The east fa\u00e7ade, which faces Beaver Avenue, is comprised of six bays, which are three-sided. Between the bays are two vertical glass block openings capped by concrete lintels. On the building's north end is the Mechanical Electrical Equipment Yard (40), which is enclosed by a one-story wall of the same cladding. One vehicle door and one pedestrian door provide access from the eastern side. The main entrance to the Warehouse is through the building's south fa\u00e7ade, which consists of a single pedestrian door reached by a short flight of concrete Figure 33. Site of the present Institution Warehouse as seen in 1921, looking northwest from what was then Petrel Street (as a result of the 1984 master plan, this street no longer exists). The Woods Run Settlement House (ca. 1902-04) dominates the view. To the left can be seen the original east wall of the penitentiary and the roof of the North Wing behind it. The Settlement House served the community until being demolished ca. 1957-67 for neighborhood redevelopment plans (University of Pittsburgh).940 Photo 40.

The building borders the Secure Perimeter on its western side and has no openings in that facade. Interior Access was not available. However, architectural plans indicate that the central space of the Warehouse is generally open in the center (except for a line of columns) with a series of store rooms along the south and west perimeters. The west end contains mechanical equipment rooms. Figure 34. Institution Warehouse floor plan, showing the main entrance at right (SCI-Pittsburgh Facilities Archive). Photo 41.

A report from 1925 indicated that \"The mess hall is a one-story building with a steel roof. . . .The erection of this building was an emergency measure. While somewhat rough in construction, it is clean and well cared for, and both lighting and ventilation are good.\" 4 The building is one story high, clad in brick and covered by a double-gable roof (i.e., the roof is composed of two parallel gables forming roughly the shape of the letter \"M\" at the end wall). The building is rectangular in plan and measures approximately 60 feet by 150 feet in plan. Primary access is from the east facade, which contains four steel doors; the southernmost being accessible by a short concrete ramp. Two wide window openings are set high in the wall. At the south end the opening has been filled with concrete block and two ventilators. To the north, the opening contains steel, multi-lite industrial sash windows into which three ventilators have been inserted. 4 Handbook of American Prisons. 506.Photo 42.

Section 7 Page 49United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Services Building 10 The west facade contains three groups of steel, multi-lite industrial sash windows with an opening at the south end infilled with glass block. The south facade contains one overhead service door at grade with four openings above containing glass block with inserted ventilators. The north facade contains a pair of double wood doors on the central axis. To the west is a six-lite, steel, industrial sash window. To the east is a projecting metal awning. Above, each gable contains a ventilator. Historic descriptions indicate that walls were originally pre-fabricated steel plate and not brick (designed for speedy installation and potential relocation). Today, the wall construction is a more permanent assembly of brick backed with structural terra cotta. While the date for this renovation has not been determined, it is interesting to note that the oversized red brick is the same as that used on the 1955 Library, Chapel and Education Building (18), suggesting that improvements at this time were widespread. The same more permanent upgrade was made to the Correctional Industries Shop Building (11, 12, 13). Similarly, when alterations were made to enlarge the Gymnasium, the same brick was used on the exterior (16). Even if these alterations were not all concurrent, they seem to reflect an acceptance on behalf of penitentiary management at this time that Western State was not going to be relocated. Figure 36. Section drawing through the Services Building, 1937, showing the double gable roof and steel trusses; excerpted from a set of blueprints for conversion of the building's function from dining hall to tailor shop. The notes on the left and right side indicate that the building was clad at that time in galvanized siding with steel sash windows above (SCI-Pittsburgh Facilities Archive).Figure 35. An article from the Philadelphia Inquirer from September 6, 1921, indicates that the dining hall (present Services Building) would be the first building to be replaced after the 1921 riot.

Services Building interior, south end, looking northwest, showing the Commissary area.Services Building 10 Interior Perimeter walls are constructed of brown structural glazed terra cotta tile (some of which has been painted white). A brick partition running east-west divides the interior into two main sections. The resulting southern third of the plan housed the commissary. The floor is vinyl tile on concrete. Overhead, the ceiling on the eastern half is open to roof deck and the western section has a finished plaster ceiling. The northern two-thirds of the building is further subdivided by lightweight steel and glass partitions (ca. 1937) creating a series of shops and work spaces on the west side of the building for activities such as a sewing and shoe repair. The latter retains much of its equipment, some manufactured by the Chandler & Price Company. The floor is concrete. The ceiling is open in these areas allowing the trusses and underside of the metal roof deck to be seen. On the east side, a computer training area was created that contained two rooms finished with vinyl tile over concrete, drywall partitions and lay-in ceiling tiles.

At the same time, a small electrical substation was built between Buildings 11 and 12 to provide power. In the 1950s, single-story additions with long gable roofs behind stepped brick parapets were constructed in the roughly 22-foot gaps between the shops to create one sprawling interconnected building. The first story of the building is brick with steel plate in the end gables. Similar to the Services Building (10) noted above, historic descriptions indicate that the exterior walls of the Correctional Industries Shop Building were originally pre-fabricated steel plate, but were upgraded to more permanent brick backed with structural terra cotta. As noted, this most likely occurred in the mid-1950s\u2014a theory further supported by the construction date of the single-story additions (i.e., when the gaps between the original shops were filled in, the entire facade was reconstructed). From the top of each shop, a nine-foot high gabled monitor with operable, steel, multi-lite, industrial sash windows provides natural light into the interior. Each Figure 37. A Pittsburgh Post-Gazette article from October 11, 1921 discusses construction of the new buildings (albeit with inaccurate dimensions) and how they will be bolted together rather than riveted for future disassembly and relocation.

Primary access is via large overhead service doors in the east end of each shop as well as in the infill additions. The west facade contains one pedestrian door into Building 11 and rolling doors into Buildings 12 and 13. The latter are enclosed on the exterior by metal mesh panels. Doors in the east end of the shop are flanked on each side by a pair of wide, steel, multi-lite, industrial sash windows set approximately six feet above grade. On the long sides of the shops, similar bands of industrial steel sash windows remain and are high enough that the roofs of the 1950s infill additions do not obscure the natural light. Throughout the building some of the industrial steel sashes have been replaced with glass block. In general, windows are covered on the exterior with wire mesh hoods that provide security, but still allow windows to open.Photo 48.

Floors are concrete throughout and ceilings are open to reveal the steel trusses and the underside of the steel roof decks. Newspaper accounts from 1921 indicate that portions of the concrete slab from the previous shop buildings were able to be reused as the floor for the new shops. In the three shops, 11'-10\" of clear space exists from the floor to the underside of the trusses. Equipment and assembly lines remain throughout the building, which were in operation until 2017. Building 11 contained the Tag Shop, where license plates were manufactured for the State of Pennsylvania. In plan, this space is divided into three sections by partitions made of speed tile (unglazed, structural terra cotta block). Additionally, the southeast corner contains the Tag Plant Office, constructed of structural glazed terra cotta tile. A steel mezzanine spans the west end of the space. Building 12 contained the Metal Shop. In plan it consists of one large interior space with three rooms in the northeast corner constructed of structural glazed terra cotta. Stairs and an overhead hatch provide access to a storage mezzanine above these rooms. The mezzanine contains a wood floor set into the spaces between the trusses. Building 13 contained the Welding Shop. In plan it is divided north-south by a brick partition containing a steel rolling door with glass lites. On the north side of the eastern section is a square office constructed of structural glazed terra cotta tile. It has an elevated wood floor and steel industrial sash windows. As noted, the infill additions were constructed to sit below the windows of the shops. Like the shops, floors in these space are concrete. Walls are generally brick. There is no natural light.

When originally constructed, the building was nine bays deep (on the east and west facades) and these bays were clad in mint green glazed brick, which remain today between rusticated cast concrete piers that have been painted white. The piers support steel trusses, which support the roof. Above the brick are wide glass block windows into which have been inserted a variety of ventilators, operable aluminum windows (typically two-lite sliding sashes) and glass block. The east facade contains two metal doors with projecting cast concrete roofs. The west facade contains two similar metal doors with roofs along with two recessed steel doors at the south end. Section 7 Page 59United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania 15 Dining Hall Harry W. Viehman (1887-1972) Pittsburgh-born architect Harry Viehman earned his engineering degree from Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1910 and his architecture degree in 1912. In the early years of his career he was associated with architects E. B. Lee and and Frederick Bigger before launching his own firm in 1915. Among his notable designs are the Brentwood High School, the bath house at the Dormant Municipal Pool, buildings at the Rockview State Penitentiary and a number of residences throughout Pittsburgh's South Hills. He was married to Alice M. Shiffman and the couple had three daughters and a son. Figure 42. In 1938, long before the trend in residential downsizing and tiny houses, Viehman displayed a collection of forty, small, 5- and 6-room houses that he designed \"for better living at lower cost.\" The exhibit was featured at the flagship Kaufmann's department store in Pittsburgh. Photo 53. Dining Hall, east facade, looking west, showing a side entrance and typical building materials, such as mint green glazed brick, painted concrete piers and glass block.In 1957, the building was enlarged with a tenth bay to the south and the kitchen was moved from its original location at the north end of the building to the new larger south end. At this time, a small single-story, half-round bay with glass block windows was also constructed on the new south facade (it originally served as a dishwashing room and most recently as a vegetable preparation space). The main walls of the addition are clad in red brick, but the round wall of the south bay is glad in mint green glazed brick, matching that of the original building. The firm of Charles M. and Edward Stotz, Jr., designed the addition. In the 1950s, the firm also designed the present Library, Chapel and Education Building (18) as well as additional floors in the Rotunda (4). The primary entrance to the Dining Hall is on the north facade, which is five bays wide and constructed primarily of cast concrete painted white that rises above the roofline to form a parapet. Bays one, three and five (counting from Photo 54. Dining Hall, south facade, looking northeast, showing the red brick south wall of the 1957 addition and the half-round dish washing room in mint green glazed brick and glass block.

The other two bays each contain a single metal door. Interior Perimeter walls are constructed of light mint-colored structural glazed terra cotta tile with glass block above. The floor is vinyl tile on concrete. The ceiling is finished with plaster and follows the curve of the steel roof truss except at the perimeter, where the ceiling flattens out and the ends of the truss are visible where they anchor into the walls. Adhesive residue across the entirety of the ceiling presents a rough textured appearance and suggests that the ceiling was at one time covered with 12\" x 12\" acoustic tiles (a few tiles of this type remain above the north entrance). In plan the building is divided into five primary areas. The northern two-thirds of the building contains the largest space\u2014an open dining area with a lightweight aluminum and glass partition (ca. 1984) on the south end through which inmates were served their meals. Ten rectangular and seventy-one octagonal steel tables are anchored to the floor. They have white laminate tops with metal bases and attached red metal seats. Flanking the north entrance are two support spaces constructed of glazed brick. The northwest corner contains a small office; the northeast corner contains a food tray washing area. Beyond the glass partition, from north to south are a series of spaces that generally have concrete floors and structural terra cotta tile walls: food serving (ceiling of lay-in tiles); kitchen (brick floor and plaster ceiling that follows the curve of the roof trusses); bake shop in the later tenth bay of the building (flat ceiling showing the adhesive residue of former tiles); and the half-round vegetable prep room. The latter has mint green glazed brick walls (matching that of the exterior) and a painted drywall ceiling. Figure 43.

Gymnasium, west facade, looking southeast. Constructed: Ca. 1900; enlarged and remodeled ca. 1939 Architect: Unknown Original function: Electric plant, ca. 1900 Recent function: Gymnasium, since ca. 1939 Construction: Brick with steel trusses Number of floors: 1, with mezzanine at north end Approximate footprint: 7,100 SF Approximate area: 7,400 SF Historical Significance: Contributing Exterior The Gymnasium began as the long-awaited electric plant for the penitentiary, which was completed sometime around 1900. With the completion of the new Power House (27A) in 1939, the old building was gutted, expanded to the south and fully renovated for its current use. The Gymnasium is a one story, rectangular building clad in red brick with a gable roof. It measures 70 feet wide by 102 feet deep by 40 feet high. Primary access is via the south facade, which contains two pairs of metal doors. The east facade is seven bays wide with each bay measuring approximately 14 feet. The southernmost six bays contain large glass block windows, two of which have operable metal hopper windows inserted into them and four contain louvered ventilators. The sills for the windows are roughly nine feet above grade. The remaining bay to the north is solid brick, to account for the office and mezzanine spaces on the interior. The west facade is similar, except that only windows are inset into the glass block (no ventilators) and the third bay from the north contains a pair of metal doors beneath the window. Figure 44.

Since the gym is taller, some of its brick north facade is visible above the neighboring roof line. Interior Perimeter walls are constructed of caramel colored structural glazed terra cotta tile that rises to the ceiling\u2014a height of approximately 20 feet. The floor is concrete covered with rubberized tiles that demark boundaries for various games. The ceiling is finished plaster and is flat, but steel anchors connected to the steel trusses puncture the ceiling and extend to the side walls. The north end of the first floor contains shallow, interconnected office space and a small dressing room. Above this is an open mezzanine with a wire mesh front wall, which is reached by a straight-run steel stair on the west side of the building. Photo 58.

Maintenance Building, west facade, looking southeast, with the Gymnasium shown at the far right. 17 Exterior Like the Gymnasium to its south, historic records suggest that the Maintenance Building began as part of the electric plant for the penitentiary, which was completed sometime around 1900. An analysis of historic maps indicates that the southern half of the Maintenance Building was competed around 1900 to house the electrical dynamo room and a northern addition was completed around 1910 to accommodate a pump house. With the completion of the new Power House (27A) in 1939, the old building was renovated for its current use. The Maintenance Building is a one story, rectangular building clad in red brick with a gable roof. Its south side adjoins the Gymnasium (16); and its north side adjoins the Library, Chapel and Education Building (18). Primary access is from the west facade, where a wooden ramp (ca. 2007) leads to a steel pedestrian door and an wide overhead service door. This facade contains five glass block windows into which operable aluminum sash windows (with blue plexiglas lites) and/or window air conditioner units have been inserted along with a former service door that has been filled in with brick. The east facade contains four similar glass block windows, two similar but shorter windows located higher in the wall, and a former service door that has been infilled with brick along with a steel pedestrian door, which is reached via a concrete ramp.

Library, Chapel and Education Building, west facade, looking northeast. Constructed: 1955 Architect: Charles M. and Edward Stotz, Jr. Original function: Security Warehouse Recent function: Library, chapel and education services Construction: Steel frame with brick veneer Number of floors: 2 plus basement Approximate footprint: 11,000 SF Approximate area: 30,000 SF Historical Significance: Contributing Exterior The Library, Chapel and Education building was designed by Charles M. and Edward Stotz, Jr. Completed in 1955, it served its original purpose as the Security Warehouse only until 1963, when it was converted (at least in part) to certain educational uses. When Housing Units A and B were constructed in the 1980s, the freestanding chapel and school were demolished and those functions were fully incorporated into Building 18. The red brick building is two stories tall plus a full basement. It measures approximately 155 feet wide by 70 feet deep by 28 feet high. It is covered by a flat roof through which extends a penthouse to provide roof access from the center stair. The building is constructed so that steel posts form a structural grid measuring roughly 17 feet x 23 feet per bay. Primary access is from the west facade, which is approximately eight bays wide (fenestration is irregular from floor to floor). The first story contains seven steel doors and two windows with multi-lite, industrial steel sashes. The doors at the the north and south end provide access into stairwells, which lead up or down, but not directly into the first floor. The second story contains eight similar Figure 50.

Some of the windows have been modified to accommodate air conditioner units. The first story of the east facade contains one industrial steel sash window, two overhead service doors, and five steel pedestrian doors (some of which provide access to mechanical spaces not connected to the interior of the building). The second story contains eight windows with industrial steel sashes similar to those on the west facade. The north facade is all brick with one industrial steel sash window in the center of the second story plus one former window opening now filled in with brick. The south side of the building adjoins Building 17. Interior The basement is divided into two primary functions. The western third served as the penitentiary's barber shop. The floor in this area is vinyl tile; walls are light yellow structural glazed terra cotta tile; the ceiling is interlocking tile between the structural beams (which have been encased in concrete for fireproofing and painted white). The eastern two-thirds was utilized for dietary storage. In the north half, the floor is covered with vinyl tile, perimeter walls and columns are clad in tan structural glazed terra cotta tile, and the ceiling is similar to that in the barber shop. The south half is more utilitarian, with a concrete floor, unpainted beams and ceilings, and the same tan wall tile. The first floor housed two primary functions reached by separate entrances: the library at the north end and the chapel at the south end. Walls in the library are constructed of the same tan glazed structural tile as the basement; the floor is carpeted and the ceiling consists of lay-in tiles. Red steel library shelving is attached to most walls with some additional low freestanding shelving. Along the north wall is a series of three interconnected offices. To the south is a one-room law library with similar finishes.Charles Morse Stotz (1898-1985) Charles Stotz was an architect, architectural historian, and preservationist. He is known for his extensive study of the architectural history of Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania, particularly his 1936 book The Early Architecture of Western Pennsylvania. He earned his M. Arch. degree from Cornell in 1922 then joined the firm of his father, Edward Stotz, in Pittsburgh. Upon his father's retirement in 1936, the firm became Charles M. And Edward Stotz, Jr. Edward Stotz, Jr. (1896-1964) Edward Stotz, Jr. began working for his father's firm in 1917 and earned his civil engineering degree from Lehigh University in 1919. Together, the brothers are perhaps best known for their preservation projects, such as the restoration of Old Economy Village in Ambridge, PA, and collaboration on the design of Point State Park and its Portal Bridge and Fort Pitt Museum.

Lockers in the space provided storage for the supplies needed by each religious group to perform their services. Flanking the entrance are three office/meeting spaces. To the east are two storage bays, accessible only from the exterior via overhead service doors. The second floor, which housed the educational services of the penitentiary has similar wall materials, but most have been painted white. Floors are covered with 9\" x 9\" gray vinyl tiles (likely original). Ceilings are painted drywall. The dozen or so spaces are divided based on the structural grid using lightweight steel and glass partitions.

Constructed: Ca. 1984 Architect: Unknown Original function: Scale house Recent function: Guard space Construction: Concrete block Number of floors: 1 Approximate footprint: 80 SF Historical Significance: Non-contributing Exterior The Scale House originally served to weigh items entering and leaving the penitentiary. Until about 1984, the Scale House was located further to the west, so that it would be on the driver's side as vehicles entered the grounds from the sally port. The current building does not appear to be a relocation of a historic building, nor does it appear to have any function related to weights and measures. The Scale House is a single-story concrete block building with front-facing gable roof covered with asphalt shingles. The west facade contains a wood pedestrian door and two-lite, aluminum hopper window. The north and south facades each contain a single aluminum double-hung sash window.

Health Services Building, west facade, looking southeast. Location map26 Exterior The Health Services Building, constructed in 1994, replaced a hospital on the same site from 1939. This is the third hospital to serve the penitentiary. The current structure is a three-story, rectangular block clad in brown brick on a concrete masonry unit (CMU) base. A recessed brick stringcourse extends around the building between each story. The primary entrance is on the west facade, which is three bays wide with a slightly projecting central bay. Accentuating the entrance is a one-story covered porch and concrete ramp supported by four brick and CMU piers. All facades contain window openings that are approximately 4-feet wide by 6-feet high. However, some of the openings contain a full pane of glass while the rest have a pane about 1/6 the size with the remainder of the opening infilled with decorative brickwork. These smaller openings typically correspond to cells on the interior. The east facade contains the only other egress to the building, consisting of two pairs of steel pedestrian doors. The roof is flat and contains mechanical and stair penthouses and a gabled wire mesh roof that covers an outdoor recreation yard on the top floor.

On the ground floor, the entrance opens into a central lobby/waiting area. East of this is a main corridor that runs north-south that leads at each end to elevators and stairwells that serve all floors. This floor contains a series of rooms divided by painted concrete block and drywall partitions that accommodated reception, sick call, triage, medication delivery, medical records, telemedicine and lab and X-ray services. The first floor housed the mental health treatment unit and consists primarily of cells organized around a central day room partitioned by concrete block walls. At the southwest corner there is a suite of staff offices. The second floor housed oncology services, wards for inmate recuperation, two isolation cells with negative air pressure to prevent the spread of air-borne infections, offices in the southwest corner, and the aforementioned outdoor recreation room in the northeast corner. Throughout the building, public spaces are decorated with painted murals created by inmates of the penitentiary. Photo 76.

The building is two-story, brick-faced structure with flat roof enclosed by a brick parapet with stone cap. The primary entrance is on the east facade, which contains steel pedestrian doors at the north and south ends that are reached by concrete steps. In between, on each floor, are four large window openings that contain multi-lite, industrial, steel sash windows. Between the windows are simple brick pilasters with stone caps that match the stone that caps the parapet. The south facade is three bays wide and contains similar windows on each floor along with openings that have been infilled with concrete block or steel panels. The south facade also contains the single-story Maintenance Office (14)\u2014a one-story wing that is clad in brick and covered with a gable roof. The north end of the Maintenance Office abuts the Maintenance Shops Building (28) and its south end abuts the Boiler Plant (27). However, these spaces are not connected on the interior.

The east facade contains a similar door and window, but the center of the window has been modified to accommodate an air conditioning unit. The east facade contains the Maintenance Repair Building (23)\u2014a one-story wing that is clad in brick and covered with a shed roof. Its south and north facades each contain a steel pedestrian door and its east facade contains four large former openings that have been infilled with concrete block, one steel pedestrian door, and two vinyl sliding windows. Above the shed roof are four multi-lite, industrial, steel sash windows similar to those on the west facade of the building (though they have been modified to accommodate ventilating equipment). The north facade contains the Welding Shop (29)\u2014a one-story wing that is clad in brick and covered with a flat roof behind a stone-capped brick parapet. Its east and west facades each contain one large multi-lite, industrial, steel sash window and its north facade contains four overhead service doors for vehicle access into the building. Above this wing the second story contains multi-lite, industrial, steel sash windows in the east and west bays. The center bay contains one similar but narrower industrial sash along with a similar sized opening that has been infilled with concrete block. Interior As mentioned above, the Maintenance Office (14) is not connected internally to the other spaces in Maintenance Shops/Office Building. The same also appears to be true for the Maintenance Repair wing (23). Access was not available and there was no readily-visible connection from the main Maintenance Shops Building (28). The first floor of the Maintenance Shops Building (28) has concrete floors, walls of structural glazed terra cotta tile (some of which has been painted white), a cast concrete ceiling slab and some visible cast concrete columns with mushroom caps (tapered concrete extensions at the tops of concrete columns to assist in the transfer of loads). In plan, the building housed two primary functions: a carpentry shop to the south and a metal shop to the north. A door in the northeast corner of the metal shop provides access to the Welding Shop (29) down a short flight of steps. The floor in this space is concrete; the south wall is brick with the remainder being structural glazed terra cotta tile (all walls have been painted); and the ceiling is open to the underside of the roof deck. The second floor of the Maintenance Shops Building (reached via the northern door on the east facade) is constructed of similar materials and finishes as the first floor (concrete floor, ceiling and columns) and terra cotta walls. Additionally, there are painted concrete block and wire mesh partitions that divide the space into a central north-south hall surrounded by a series of repair shops (including construction , electronics, painting and refrigeration).Maintenance Shops/Office Building 28 14 23 29 Section 7 Page 83United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Number Not Used 30 Photo 82.

Floors, walls and ceilings are constructed of painted cast concrete throughout the building. In plan, the first floor has a large mechanical panel on the north wall directly across from the front door. Its front face contains a series of pump controls/meters and a large \"Westinghouse\" label. A door on its east side provides access to additional mechanical equipment behind the panel. A small bathroom is tucked into the northwest corner adjacent to the control panel. In the southwest corner is a cast iron circular staircase that leads down to the first sub-floor.This level contains similar materials and finishes. In the southeast corner is a similar cast iron staircase that leads down to the second sub-floor. Access lower than this point was not possible since the lowest spaces were flooded. Photo 84.

Constructed: 1927 Architect: Unknown Original function: Filter house for Roberta Lang Swimming Pool Recent function: Storage Construction: Brick Number of floors: 1 Approximate footprint: SF Approximate Area: 1,500 SF Historical Significance: ContributingLocation map32 Exterior The Maintenance Storage Building originally served at the filter house for the Roberta Lang Swimming Pool which was located on the site of the present North Parking Lot. The building is two stories high, clad in red brick and covered with a gable roof. The roof, ca. 2007, appears to rest on parapets, suggesting that the building originally had a flat roof. Marking the locations of windows on each story are four belt courses of slightly projecting brick, which provide a sense of horizontality to the building. This ornament and the flat roof offer a hint to the building's International or Art Moderne Style. Windows are multi-lite, steel sashes with stone sills. The only door is a steel rolling door with a simple carved stone surround located on the center of the west facade. Interior Access was not available.

It measures twenty-five feet high, three feet thick at its top, and four feet thick at its base. Atop the wall is a railed walkway that connects to six observation towers at strategic corners. Architect Edward Butz designed parts of the wall as part of his vision for the original facility. The north wall and northern end of the east wall are constructed of Massillon sandstone block and were finished by 1883. The south wall and southern end of the east wall, also of Massillon sandstone, were completed by 1893. The remainder of the east wall is cast concrete and was constructed in 1932 as part of an expansion of the penitentiary grounds. The top of the 1932 section is decorated on the exterior by a row of cast concrete dentils. The Sally Port allows vehicles to enter and exit the penitentiary while maintaining security. Large overhead, steel service doors in the north and south walls would be opened one at a time to allow inspection by penitentiary staff. While this is the historic location of the vehicle sally port, its current design dates from 1951, when the original plan was enlarged. Guard Towers 1-6 (atop the penitentiary walls) Six observation towers are located at strategic corners atop the wall that encloses the Secure Perimeter (see site map for locations). However, they haven't been occupied by guards for decades, their function having been surpassed by video camera technology. Tower 1, located at the northwest corner of the Secure Perimeter is an octagonal brick structure with two doors, six six-lite steel sash windows and a flat roof. Tower 2, located at the juncture of the north and east walls, is of similar design. Tower 3, located at the northeast corner of the expanded 1932 wall, and Tower 4, located at the corresponding southeast corner, are both octagonal structures with two doors and six multi-lite steel sash windows. They are clad in sheet metal, which has obtained a green-blue patina, and are covered with a flat roof with projecting ventilator. Tower 5, located at the southeast corner of the Secure Perimeter, and Tower 6, located at the southwest corner, are similar in design to Towers 1 and 2. The shafts of Towers 1, 2, 4 and 5 have doors to the street at their bases, suggesting that they contain interior stairs or ladders to the towers above. However, access was not available to confirm this. An additional tower sits atop the Sally Port walls. It is small, and square in plan and contains two wood doors with two lites, two two-lite wood sash windows, and a shallow gable roof. Photo 87.

On the north side, close to the Three Rivers Heritage Trail, is a single-leaf gate; on the west side, on axis with the Warden's Residence, is a two-leaf gate. The gates are supported on square posts constructed of cast iron plates. The posts are topped by cast iron capitals that were electrified and contained glass globes (though only the cast iron fixture bases remain). A third, larger gate is located on the west side, further to the south. It is six bays wide and contains sliding gate sections suspended from an overhead rail. Though not called out on any maps, the location and design suggest that this gate provided a means for deliveries to the penitentiary by railroad\u2014since the track would have been just feet away to the west. At the north end of the Historic Front Yard is a bulb-shaped water tower constructed in 1966, which replaced a previous water tower inside the prison walls. Photo 91.

Section 7 Page 91United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Assessment of Integrity Western State Penitentiary contains a total of forty-two identified resources constructed between 1878 and ca. 2007. Of these, twenty-four buildings, structures and objects were built within the period of significance (1878-1966) and contribute to the district's historical significance. Eighteen resources are non-contributing. Most of these were constructed after the period of significance, including eight small-scale modular units, trailers, and sheds installed upon the penitentiary's re-opening ca. 2007 which have a provisional feel. The former warden's garage (more recently used as a storage building, constructed in the historic front yard ca. 1930 and with additions from ca. 1940 and subsequent alterations) was built during the period of significance, but its design and placement appear disconnected from the district's overall site and architectural design. Overall, Western State Penitentiary possesses integrity of location, setting, design, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association. The penitentiary's location is the same as the one on which construction began in 1878. Forces of urbanization and, in the mid-20th century, urban redevelopment have altered the penitentiary's setting. What was once a suburban residential neighborhood is now a swath of industrial uses sandwiched between the Ohio River and a highway. However, the river itself anchors the penitentiary to the historic characteristics of its waterfront site and provides integrity of setting. Despite alterations to individual buildings and to the complex as a whole, Western State Penitentiary also retains integrity of design, materials, and workmanship. The most consequential alterations have been the removal of the Main Penitentiary Building's original High Victorian Gothic roof in 1959 and the construction of several buildings in the 1980s and 1990s which disrupted the original orthogonal symmetry and riverfront orientation of the site. However, the roof removal left intact the most significant aspects of the prison's architecture, namely its monumental Auburn-style cell block design, its combination of ancient and technologically advanced building materials and systems, and the composition of the campus to include separate spaces for dining, exercise, work, and other programmatic activities. Moreover, the roof was removed during the penitentiary's period of significance and was part of ongoing attempts to transform Western State into a modern\u2014in the 20th century sense\u2014institution. This is part of the story of its significance. The buildings of the 1980s and 1990s are intrusive to the original site design but do not damage it irreparably. Western State Penitentiary's integrity of feeling and association derive from its integrity of location, setting, design, and materials. The monumentality of the prison's public face, the varied purpose and design of the buildings within its walled compound, and its ongoing relationship to the river continue to convey its history as a Victorian-era institution which housed prisoners in an urban setting for over 130 years while adapting to a changing community and to an evolving penal culture.

Statement of Significance Summary Paragraph Western State Penitentiary is a former state prison originally constructed between 1878 and 1893 on the east bank of the Ohio River in Pittsburgh. At the time of its completion, it was the most expensive and modern prison in the world. It replaced two earlier Western State Penitentiaries built in 1826 and 1836, respectively, on a site about three miles away in the former Allegheny City and represents an evolution in thinking about prison design since the initiation of the state penitentiary system in 1790. The transformation of the area around the Allegheny City site into a landscaped public park, or commons, after the Civil War, along with desires for a larger site and programmatic reforms, influenced the relocation of Western State to its present site and provided an opportunity for its warden in the late 19th century, Edward S. Wright, and its governing Board of Inspectors to implement new ideas. Wright and the Inspectors viewed the prison not only as a place of punishment but as a humanitarian institution of reform. They subscribed to contemporary theories about the causes and remedies of criminal behavior and strove to implement innovations in the housing, treatment, employment, and rehabilitation of inmates at Western State. Largely through Wright's efforts, Western State Penitentiary emerged as a leader in penology in Pennsylvania during the late 19th century. However, limitations of its land-locked and flood-prone site soon caused administrators to seek alternatives. At the same time, legal restrictions on inmate labor curtailed lofty ambitions to rehabilitate inmates through vocational activity and to enable the prison to fund itself. Nevertheless, despite numerous recommendations for its closure and the reorganization of the state prison system to favor rural sites, Western State Penitentiary continued to operate through the early 21st century. It ceased to innovate and, instead, adapted to changing needs by constructing industrial, maintenance, and other facilities in the prison yard. After 1893, major periods of construction were the 1920s-30s and the 1980s-90s. Western State Penitentiary is recommended eligible for the National Register under Criterion A for its exemplification of a variety of penological reforms which led Pennsylvania's approach to the treatment of prisoners and design of modern prisons during the 19th century. Because this theme does not fit neatly into one of the National Register's established Areas of Significance, the Area of Significance for this resource is Other: Penology. Western State Penitentiary is also recommended eligible under Criterion C as a significant example of a Victorian-era penitentiary that combined historical architectural forms and methods of construction with modern advances in infrastructure, utilities, sanitation, and features of prison design influenced by the industrial revolution. Western State Penitentiary's period of significance is 1878-1966. The first year marks the beginning of the penitentiary's construction on its present site. From 1878 to 1900, Western State led the state in a variety of penological reforms and their architectural expressions. After 1900, prison funding in Pennsylvania\u2014already insufficient\u2014shifted to other sites in the system, while innovation in penology lagged nationwide. However, Western State continued to play an important role in Pennsylvania corrections and so maintains state-level significance during the 20th century. The end date marks the completion of the water tower in the Historic Front Yard, which was the last major construction prior to the non-historic additions made under the 1984 master plan.United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Section 8 Page 98 Figure 57. Engraving of Walnut Street Jail, Philadelphia. The Robert Smith designed penitentiary was hailed as a model of prison reform when it opened in 1773. It was further expanded in 1790 but closed in 1835 due to overcrowding and the desire to house inmates in Auburn-style facilities. The structure was demolished shortly after its closing (William Russell Birch, 1804). 5 Norman Johnston, Forms of Constraint: A History of Prison Architecture (Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 2000), 42. 6 John C.

Under this system, rudimentary jails, workhouses, or blockhouses were sometimes used to detain offenders awaiting sentencing and punishment, most often corporal; confinement was not a punishment in and of itself. As first governor of Pennsylvania, William Penn sought reform of this system and its often brutal treatment of criminals. Penn's \"Great Law\" of 1682 called for a reduction in capital and corporal punishment, the establishment of government-run houses of correction, and a program of useful work for prisoners, but these reforms were repealed by Queen Anne after Penn's death in 1718. Following independence, states began to establish their own systems for punishing offenders (the federal government would not establish its own penal agency, the Bureau of Prisons, until 1891). New thinking about the causes of crime informed many of these activities. The connection of unlawful behavior to external conditions, such as poverty, lack of education, and drunkenness, replaced blame on criminals' inherent evil nature or sinfulness. 5 This shift in thinking generally supported the idea of confinement and control as suitable paths to reform and retribution. Quaker activists in Pennsylvania set about reinstating much of Penn's code, re- establishing incarceration over corporal punishment as the primary form of correction. However, problematic conditions in city and county prisons spurred activists to demand further reforms. Led by Benjamin Rush, a prominent physician and statesman, the Society for Alleviating the Miseries of Public Prisons (later known as the Philadelphia Prison Society) campaigned to implement a more humane prison system for Pennsylvania, including adequate and healthful meals, work programs within\u2014not outside\u2014prison walls, abolishment of hard labor, more stringent supervision and classification of inmates, and improved sanitation. In 1789 and 1790, the Pennsylvania State Legislature passed laws providing for the establishment of modern penitentiaries. The penitentiary\u2014from the root word \"penitent\"\u2014became regarded as a humanitarian institution and an enlightened system for dealing with individuals who behaved outside of laws and social norms: offenders would be removed from mainstream society, separated from corrupting influences, and subject to a meticulously disciplined environment that encouraged them to reflect, repent and reform. 6 Such theories of repentance found support in the work of activists and reformers such as Dorothea Dix, who advocated for special care and housing for mentally ill criminals. Early examples of penitentiaries, such as Western and Eastern State in Pennsylvania, were idealistic experiments, and their buildings were objects of civic pride, and even tourist attractions. On an interim basis, Philadelphia's Walnut Street Jail was expanded to serve as the first such institution, receiving the addition of a penitentiary block in 1790. It incarcerated offenders as punishment; used a rudimentary classification system United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Section 8 Page 99 Figure 58.

In 1818, the Pennsylvania legislature passed an act authorizing the construction of two state penitentiaries, one each for the eastern and western parts of the state. The first to be constructed in 1826 was the original Western State Penitentiary in Allegheny, then a borough across the Allegheny River from Pittsburgh. Eastern State Penitentiary opened in Philadelphia in 1829. In 1836, the original Western State Penitentiary was replaced with a second prison on the same site. Taken together, these three early Pennsylvania penitentiaries represent three distinct models that emerged for correctional institutions around the turn of the nineteenth century: the panopticon, the Pennsylvania System, and the Auburn System. A fourth system, the Irish System, was not fully supported by Pennsylvania law, but aspects of it were adopted and combined with the Auburn System at Western State. With these events, Pennsylvania emerged at the turn of the nineteenth century as a leader in penal reform, with governments in other states and foreign countries looking to its experiments as models for their own systems. 8 First Western State Penitentiary: Modified Panopticon The original Western State Penitentiary was located on the site of what is now the National Aviary in Allegheny Commons, a public grazing land which was redesigned as a park after the Civil War. Construction began shortly after the authorizing act in 1818 and the prison opened to twelve prisoners on July 1, 1826. Built to the design of American architect William Strickland, it was a variation on the model of a panopticon prison.

Barnes later became influenced by the Holocaust denial movement. However, his work on the history of penology during the 1920s appears to be credible and based in verifiable fact.The panopticon principle of prison design originated with English philosopher and scholar Jeremy Bentham in 1791 and was intended for optimal surveillance in institutions containing large numbers of residents requiring supervision. Panopticon prisons were usually circular or semi-circular, multi-story buildings with cells around the perimeter, facing an interior well or courtyard containing a watchtower. In theory, this central vantage point allowed for constant surveillance of prisoners who would, consequently, be better behaved and disposed to internalize new habits of conduct. The central guard's station also facilitated group address of inmates, including sermons; religious instruction was thought to be vital to reform. 9 Strickland's design for the first Western Penitentiary was surrounded by a monumental, octagonal stone wall three feet thick and contained 190 individual six-by-nine foot cells for the solitary confinement of prisoners. The cells were positioned back-to-back in two concentric rings on a single floor. The central watchtower appears never to have been built; for supervision of the outer ring of cells, Strickland designed perimeter watchtowers at points along the prison wall. This wall was unbroken except by an massive entrance gate which also served as administration building and warden's residence. Strickland's design contained flaws that led to this prison's being entirely rebuilt after only ten years. The combination of double-tiered cell layout and curved walls meant that sight lines did not permit omnipresent surveillance. Moreover, as a result of having an open courtyard instead of a closed watchtower at its center, surveillance went both ways; prisoners knew when they were being watched and when they weren't and could adjust their behavior accordingly. 10 Constant solitary confinement led to health problems that warranted occasionally allowing prisoners to leave their cells, undermining the principle of solitary confinement. In 1829, an act of the PA legislature established a requirement for inmate labor, amending the policy of separate confinement with the goals of relieving monotony and teaching prisoners a trade which would help them upon release. But Western Penitentiary's cells proved too small and dark for the inmates to perform handicrafts in them. 11 A legislative act of 1833 authorized the demolition of the first Western State Penitentiary. It was replaced with a second facility on the same site in 1836. Eastern State Penitentiary and the Pennsylvania System As penology in Pennsylvania evolved, so did its administration. The same act of 1829 that permitted convict labor also set up a governing system for the state penitentiaries. For both Western State Penitentiary and its new counterpart in the eastern part of the state, a five-member Board of Inspectors was appointed by the state Supreme Court. The Inspectors had control over financial, administrative, and industrial matters at each prison, including the salaries of the prison wardens, doctors, clerks, and religious instructors. 12 Opened in the same year in Philadelphia, Eastern State Penitentiary (originally Cherry Hill Prison) became the prototype for the Pennsylvania System of penitentiary design, also known as the Separate System due to the principle of complete solitary confinement at its core. Alone in their cells or hooded on the few occasions they were brought into contact with one another, inmates were United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Section 8 Page 10113 Roberts, 33. 14 Minutes of the Building Commission, reproduced in Negley K.

John Haviland's radial configuration of Eastern State Penitentiary, Philadelphia, PA (Lithograph by P.S. Duval and Co., 1885). supposed to interact only with prison staff and chaplains. Prisoners were expected to become penitent as they engaged in work, Bible study, and reflection on their misdeeds in solitary confinement. From a management standpoint, solitary confinement was also supposed to keep prisoners from conspiring with one another and to facilitate their control by guards. 13 The goal of the Pennsylvania System was to reform offenders so as to release them back into society. To implement this penal system, British-born architect John Haviland pioneered a radial plan for Eastern State which, like the panopticon, was designed to facilitate surveillance. The penitentiary was a ten-acre walled compound with a watchtower at its center and seven cell blocks extending outward like spokes. Each cell block was laid out with a central corridor, double-loaded with cells on either side; thus, each cell was afforded a window to the outdoors. Ground-floor cells also had access to individual exercise yards. The cells had plumbing, and they were relatively large at eight by twelve feet, enabling inmates to work inside on various handicrafts (such as shoes, textiles, caned chairs, and cigars) that were sold to help defray prison costs. The prison's Gothic Revival architecture, with \"cheerless blank\" walls, lancet windows, and castellated towers, was intended to communicate a sense of foreboding. 14 The Pennsylvania System for confinement, as expressed at Eastern State Penitentiary and at Haviland's later New Jersey State Prison (1833-1836) in Trenton, became one of the most famous and widely-imitated in the world during the Victorian period.

Photograph showing the massive fortress-like entrance to John Haviland's second Western Penitentiary in Allegheny Commons (Allegheny City Historic Gallery). Second Western State Penitentiary and Transition to the Auburn System Meanwhile, other states implemented their own prison systems and reforms. In particular, in New York, the state prisons at Auburn (built between 1816 and 1825) and Ossining (known as Sing Sing, 1825) provided a rival model to the Pennsylvania System which ultimately came to dominate American corrections. 15 Also known as the Congregate System, the Auburn System kept prisoners isolated in solitary cells at night but allowed them to eat and work together, in silence, during the day. This ideology of prison management resulted in an architectural prototype for penitentiaries with long rows of tiered cells for individual confinement and separate, more spacious facilities for group activities. Because of the congregate nature of inmate labor under this system, Auburn- style prisons were built with large workshops which lent themselves to industrial factory production. Individual cells could be smaller since they were only used for sleeping. Thus, the Auburn system emerged as economically advantageous over the Pennsylvania System. More inmates could be housed per square foot, and industrial production of prison goods was more efficient and profitable than handicrafts. 16 However, maintaining silence and order among groups of prisoners was more difficult. Disciplinary tactics such as striped uniforms and marching in lockstep had their origins in penitentiaries operating under the Auburn System. Pittsburgh's second Western State Penitentiary (referred to hereafter as WSP Commons) made a transition from the Pennsylvania System to the Auburn System during the post-Civil War years. The state again contracted with John Haviland to design this prison, completed on the same site as the first Western State in 1836. It exhibited a modified radial plan of cell blocks arranged in the form of a V with an inspection room at their apex. Like Eastern State, WSP Commons had imposing Gothic Revival design elements and an overall fortress-like appearance. An additional cell block was added between the first two in 1859.United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Section 8 Page 10319 Roberts, 34. 20 In Barnes, \"The Evolution of American Penology as Illustrated by the Western Penitentiary of the United States,\" 203. 21 Ibid. 22 Wright, 99. Figure 64. Photograph of Captain Edward S. Wright, Warden of Western Penitentiary from 1869-1901. Warden Wright was born in England and came to Pittsburgh in the mid 1840's. Prior to the Civil War, Wright served as chief clerk of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and then as city water assessor. During the Civil War, Wright was made Captain of Co. F of the 62nd Infantry Regiment and served in the field until the close of the Peninsular Campaign. After the war, Wright returned to Pittsburgh and became President of the Glass Machine Co. and reprised his roll as city water assessor. In February of 1869, Captain Wright was elected warden of the Western Penitentiary. He retired as warden in 1901 due to illness but remained an influential figure in national correctional and prison reform discussions He died on Feb 28, 1916 in the Allegheny West neighborhood of Pittsburgh (Mylin, State Prisons, Hospitals, Soldiers' Homes). 17 Edward S. Wright, \"A Brief History of Western Penitentiary\" (Pittsburgh, 1909: held at Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Reference Collection), 100. 18 Doug MacGregor, \"Western State Penitentiary: 200 Years of Leadership and Innovation,\" 3.Slow growth of the prison population prior to the Civil War allowed WSP Commons to operate in relative stability according to the Pennsylvania System until the 1860s. From 1844 to 1854, prison labor\u2014consisting of weaving on hand looms and shoemaking by prisoners in their cells\u2014provided enough income to sustain the prison, along with state appropriations for officers' salaries. 17 In the 1860s, however, the prison expanded several times to meet the demands of an increasing population and evolving standards of penology. By 1870, WSP Commons contained 324 cells in three wings, a chapel, wash house, hospital building, and a new building with 24 cells for housing female inmates. Cells themselves were enlarged to seven feet, ten inches by fifteen feet and furnished with gas lights, a four-inch slit window, and steam heat. 18 After the Civil War, several factors combined to support the construction of a third Western State Penitentiary on a new site in Allegheny. In terms of prison operations, penologists, prison inspectors, and administrators at both the Eastern and Western State institutions began to admit that the practice of solitary confinement under the Pennsylvania System was neither successful nor sustainable. Growing evidence suggested that solitary confinement promoted not reflection and rehabilitation, but psychological distress, even insanity. On a purely economic level, maintaining individual cells large enough for each inmate to perform handicrafts was expensive, especially as the population grew. 19 Western State Penitentiary's chaplain wrote that each cell at WSP Commons was \"a costly little prison in itself.\" 20 Facing overcrowding, prison administrators faced difficult decisions between further costly expansions or elimination of individual cells. Expansion of Western State on its current site seemed even less tenable after 1867, when the Allegheny Commons was redesigned into a public park. The ongoing situation of a prison in the park was in tension with the picturesque qualities of its landscape and the desirability of property at its periphery. Finally, in a fast-industrializing economy, the handicraft production of inmates working alone in their cells could not generate sufficient merchandise or income to offset the expenses of operating a large penitentiary. 21 During this same period, the Auburn System drew the attention and admiration of the Western State Board of Inspectors. In 1866, they wrote of its advantages. In 1869, the Pennsylvania legislature passed an act allowing for the congregation of inmates for work purposes in shops. In the same year, Edward S. Wright, a former captain in the Civil War, was appointed warden of Western State Penitentiary and began advocating for transition to a more Auburn-style management system. Noting that \"The method of confinement in solitude proved most unsatisfactory\" and that \"the prison population has grown faster than its accommodations,\" Wright moved immediately to implement reforms that changed operations at the prison. 22 He introduced the Congregate System, allowing prisoners to eat, work, study, and worship together. In acknowledgement of the fact that \"labor in the cells had not been remunerative for many years,\" a shoe shop accommodating 85 men was added in 1869 and a larger work shop, housing broom-making and marble polishing as well as shoemaking, was built in 1874. Wright also instituted a \"commutation law\" or United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Section 8 Page 104 Figure 65 (above). 1882 Hopkins Map showing the Western Penitentiary in the upper right corner. This map illustrates the changes to the environment of the Allegheny Commons since its creation as a city park in 1867. A comparison to Bodmer's lithograph of the penitentiary on page 92 highlights the shift from a rural to urban setting. By 1882, the surrounding streets had become a desirable address for the area's upper-middle class and concerns about the penitentiary's close proximity to the new neighborhood increased. Also of interest is the Exhibition Building in the lower part of the map, which was designed by Edward M. Butz. Figure 66 (right). An undated photograph of a fountain in the Allegheny Commons Park with the penitentiary in the upper left shows how close the complex was to the recreation areas. Lack of space for expansion and resident concerns were the driving forces behind the penitentiary's move to the Ohio River site (Allegheny City Historic Gallery).

In Wright, 101.\"good time\" rule under which prison administrators had leeway to reduce an inmate's sentence in reward for good behavior.23 Still, the facility designed for solitary confinement under the Pennsylvania System was inadequate and unable to accommodate a true Auburn System program. By the late 1870s, many cells built for one prisoner were occupied by two, three, or as many as four inmates. 24 In a report of 1877, Warden Wright noted the need for 500 new cells and a new shop, while the state Board of Inspectors painted a dire picture of conditions at the prison: [Western State Penitentiary] is altogether inadequate in its proportions for a family of from 800 to 900 convicts.... In the bracing winter weather this crowding of men may be endured, but when the hot summer days and nights overtake us we shudder for the consequences. Disease, epidemic and death must of necessity follow. 25 Western State Penitentiary RiversideIn 1876, the Inspectors suggested acquiring the site of the House of Refuge, an abandoned facility for juvenile offenders located about three miles from WSP Commons on the banks of the Ohio River in Allegheny, as an \"intermediate prison.\" In 1877, they pressed for the appropriation of this site \"not now as an annex to [the current] building, but as the site of a new, enlarged and capacious Western State Penitentiary Building.\" Perhaps anticipating objection on economic grounds, the Inspectors argued that convict labor could be used for the new prison's construction and that \"much of the material required can be removed from time to time from the present building\" and that it could be completed and occupied in phases. 26 Other advantages of the House of Refuge site were said to include its spaciousness; attractive views and fresh breezes for good ventilation; it already contained institutional buildings which could be re-used, occupied on a temporary basis, or recycled for additional building materials; and its location on a railroad line for the convenience of the Inspectors.United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Section 8 Page 106 Figure 68. 1876 Hopkins Map showing the House of Refuge, which becomes the site of the third Western Penitentiary in 1878.

House of Refuge, ca. 1850, designed by Joseph W. Kerr (O. Krebs & Bro, lithographer). 27 \"House of Refuge for Western Pennsylvania,\" Pittsburgh City Post, August 3, 1854, 3.This 1876 Hopkins map shows the dumbbell-shaped House of Refuge and its site as they were in the year the Inspectors identified this as a suitable location for a new Western State Penitentiary. The August 3, 1854 edition of the Pittsburgh City Post indicates that the facility was substantial, with a main building that was 210 feet wide and four stories tall and constructed of brick made on site. The building included separate wings for girls and boys with towers at each end, plus rear additions and a number of shops and outbuildings. 27 Enclosing everything was a 16-foot high stone wall that ran 500 feet along the river and extended back 350 feet from the river's edge. Neighboring blocks were moderately populated with mostly residential buildings. Beaver Ave., the area's main thoroughfare, lay to the east and had the highest concentration of buildings. Mills, factories, and schools were also located nearby. The Fort Wayne and Chicago Railroad ran slightly east of Beaver Ave. with lines connecting to the nearby mills to the north and south of the site. On June 12, 1878, Governor John Hartranft approved $100,000 for the construction of new buildings for Western State Penitentiary on the Riverside site. On Sept 30, the prison Inspectors took possession of House of Refuge. An undated letter from Edward M. Butz, the architect they hired (perhaps for his institutional work on the new House of Refuge in Morganza) reproduced in the Inspectors' Report of 1878 details his scope of work with dimensions and placement of structures, suggesting that design of the new prison got underway immediately. On November 27, 1878, the first of the inmates from the Commons site were transferred to Riverside, where they were housed in a temporary facility. Work on the new site was carried out in phases. John Schreiner was repeatedly hired as the stone mason, but a significant amount of general labor was performed by inmates. Preparation of the site began with the demolition of some of the House of Refuge structures and renovation of others. The North Wing of the new penitentiary was the first to open, in 1882. It was over 467 feet long with 640 cells, 100 of which were seven by eight feet in dimension, and the remainder of which were five by eight feet. A separate women's reformatory had 30 cells. In 1883-84, the outer walls and roof of the South Wing were erected by a combination of contract and prison labor.Historic Resource Survey Form Page 101Western State Penitentiary May 2018Figure 70.

Electric lighting was planned for the Riverside penitentiary from the beginning, but funding for the electric plant was delayed by the legislature until 1898 (Pittsburgh Daily Post, 07/29/1885, pg. 4). By the time of this 1884 Sanborn Map, the area had become more urban, and the Pittsburgh and Western Rail Road Freight Track had constructed an alignment across the penitentiary site parallel to the Ohio River. Western State Penitentiary was by now well established on the site. The map shows the completed North Wing of Edward Butz's design as well as the central Rotunda, which was built for guard offices; the Warden's Residence, which faced the Ohio River in front of the Rotunda; and the East Wing, all under construction. The North Wing, Rotunda, and Warden's Residence are colored blue to indicate fireproof construction. Butz also designed a stone wall to secure the perimeter of the property. It is shown here connected to the North Wing and to the near section of the East Wing. The main entrance to the penitentiary was through the Warden's Residence, which is outside the secure perimeter. The T-shaped East Wing combined part of the former House of Refuge and new Butz-designed spaces in 1884. Immediately east of the Rotunda can be seen the remains of the four-story main building of the House of Refuge, labeled \"Guard Houses/Offices and Prison Supplies/To be Removed.\" Several facts support this section of the prison having originally been part of the House of Refuge: the penitentiary reports state that the House of Refuge buildings were used temporarily, the four-story height of this section matches the 1854 written description of the House of Refuge, and its footprint matches that of the House of Refuge shown on the 1876 map. Also, the new penitentiary buildings were constructed closer to the Ohio River than the House of Refuge, suggesting that the previous buildings still stood and the new ones had to be built relative to them. The two-story wing extending perpendicularly east of this also appears to be a reused part of the House of Refuge based on correspondence between the 1854 description and the details shown on this map: both indicate a two-story wing in this location that was 30 feet tall with a second-floor chapel, 20 feet in height. A photograph of this section of the prison taken ca. 1897 appears to show such a structure. In 1884, this contained, aside from the chapel, various shops and factories, a kitchen, laundry, and engine room. A detached building on the southern part of the site was the Female Ward and Library, which was likely designed by Butz. A number of brick and frame shop and utility buildings were under construction or finished at this time. Parallel to the east wall was the Chain Shop and the Broom Factory. In the northern end of the site were the completed Machine Shop and Blacksmith Shop and two additional smaller shop buildings, the Link Bending and Cutting Shop and the Sheet Iron Building, all frame. The map also shows a large brick Shoe Factory under construction near the north wall. Several smaller outbuildings had also been constructed in the northern end of the site. The Hog Pen and Slack House were located near the east wall and the Dump House and Greenhouse were near the North Wing. Outside the secure perimeter near the Ohio River were two brick structures, one for coal storage and the other a Gas Holder.United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Section 8 Page 112 Figure 75. 1893 photo showing construction of the roof over the South Wing.

At the time of this photo, the main block of the House of Refuge has been demolished, leaving a gap between the East Wing and Main Penitentiary Building. By 1893, the stair tower (right end of East Wing) was removed and a connector was built joining the East Wing and the Rotunda (PA State Archives).By the summer of 1885, the relocation of prisoners to WSP Riverside was complete and WSP Commons stood completely vacant. Construction on the Riverside site continued with the roof of the South Wing and stone, brick, and iron work. The South Wing opened to inmates in 1891, though the Inspectors' Report for 1891-92 notes that it could not be completely finished because the legislature failed to provide necessary funds.United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Section 8 Page 1131893 Sanborn Map Figure 77. 1893 Sanborn Map showing the completion of the South Wing, the addition of the women's prison, and expansion of workshop spaces.United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Section 8 Page 114Figure 78. 1897 photograph of the area between the Broom Factory and east wall\u2014dubbed \"Wall Street\" in historic accounts (Mylin, State Prisons, Hospitals, Soldiers' Homes). The 1893 Sanborn Map shows the completion of Butz's main penitentiary buildings, including the South Wing, which was finally finished in that year. The Rotunda was finished in 1885. The Warden's Residence was now connected to the Rotunda by a two-story porte cochere with covered bridge. The wall had been completed and enclosed the whole yard east of the cell blocks, connecting to the North and South Wings. The old House of Refuge East Wing, renovated by Butz, was now connected directly to the Rotunda. The long northern arm of the East Wing, which housed the Mat Yarn Winding and Stocking Factory, had been connected to the Machine Shop. The property boundary was extended to the south between 1884 and 1893. In 1884, the boundary was Kerr St., but by 1893 the site stretched to Superior St. The wall was enlarged to correspond to the new southern perimeter. A new Women's Prison was established within the expanded southern end of the site. It was housed in a ca. 1870 two-story, Italianate style brick house that records indicate was moved from elsewhere on the site ca. 1885. In 1890, an addition of 40 cells more than doubled its size. The previous Women's Prison was converted to use as a school, kitchen, and hospital. The intensity of industrial activity at the penitentiary is evident in the considerable enlargement by this year of the shop bordering the east wall. The building had essentially doubled in width and stretched southward to incorporate the previously separate Broom Factory. The building that served as the Chain Shop in 1884 is here shown converted to the Mat Weaving House and Broom Factory, a change in function that reflected new labor laws governing the industries in which prisoners were allowed to labor. Similarly, the brick building near the northern wall, which was under construction as a Shoe Factory in 1884, was now finished, but its function changed to Mat Factory. Also along the east wall was a new Warehouse. The Greenhouse had expanded, but the Hog Shed and Slack House had been demolished, as had the Link Bending and Cutting Shop. By this time, the prison was already approaching capacity, with 1169 of 1180 cells occupied.United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Section 8 Page 115 Figure 79 (top left). 1897 photograph of the southern wall and sally port.

John Francies was warden of Western Penitentiary (and its branch, Rockview) from 1909 to 1922. He was born in Allegheny City, PA, in 1862 and served in a variety of public positions before being elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, which he held from 1903-1905. After his time as warden, Francies served in other elected positions such as Clerk of Courts in Allegheny County and Treasurer of Allegheny County. He died on October 16, 1933. Francies was notable as warden for his efforts to move the penitentiary from its Ohio River location, presiding over the creation of Rockview Penitentiary, and for the creation of a prominent inmate educational program. (Pennsylvania House of Representatives). Figure 85. Photograph of the Conservatory in the southern half of the site (labeled \"Greenhouse\" on the 1906 Sanborn Map). The Conservatory was a $5,000 gift of Henry Phipps Jr and was largely constructed by inmate labor. The dedication ceremony for the greenhouse was a large affair with 50 guests, including former warden Wright, who spoke about the need for efforts to \"uplift\" and the benefits of flowers and natural beauty. The 14-piece prison orchestra played in accompaniment to several well-known local musicians. Pittsburgh still retains its Phipps Conservatory, which is located in Schenley Park (PA State Archives). Figure 86. River scene with Western Penitentiary in the background (historic postcard, 1907). 28 Barnes, \"Pennsylvania Penology: 1944. A Report on Penal and Correctional Institutions and Correctional Policy in the State of Pennsylvania\" (State College: The Pennsylvania Municipal Publications Service, 1944, 21).While the surrounding area continued to urbanize, there were few major changes to the penitentiary site between 1893 and 1906. The middle section of the Broom Factory building, which bordered the east wall, was removed to accommodate the new Power Plant ca. 1898. The Warehouse north of the Broom Factory was enlarged slightly on its southern end. The Greenhouse in the northern part of the site was demolished, and a new Conservatory was built in the southern half of the site between the East Wing and Female Ward. The Conservatory, built in 1905, was a gift of financier and philanthropist Henry Phipps, Jr., who also donated conservatories to the cities of Pittsburgh and Allegheny, the latter built on the site of the old WSP Commons. The slowing of improvements at the penitentiary likely reflected growing frustrations with the limitations of the site. Despite the state's tremendous investment in the modern prison only 30 years before and the supposed advantages of the Riverside site, numerous conditions soon resulted in calls to build a new penitentiary elsewhere. Flooding frequently overcame the Ohio River banks; episodes in 1884, 1902, and 1907 caused uninhabitable conditions during which inmates had to be housed for long periods in unheated cells in the top tiers of the prison. Even when not flooded, proximity to the river caused damp conditions in the facility. Fog retained smoke from Pittsburgh's many riverfront mills and interfered with good light conditions for inmate labor. Overcrowding continued to be a problem, and outbreaks of communicable disease such as tuberculosis and typhoid were common. Writing in 1921, when the prison was still very much in operation, Harry Elmer Barnes, a scholar of penological history, wrote, \"It would be difficult to estimate the misery, suffering, ill-health, loss of life, inconvenience, and inefficiency caused by the ill- judgement of those who decided to locate the new Western Penitentiary in this place.\" 28United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Section 8 Page 118 Figure 87. Rockview Penitentiary, ca. 1940. Rockview (now called SCI Rockview) is located in Centre County, between State College and Bellefonte, PA. Rockview originally was planned to replace Western and Eastern Penitentiary as a central state maximum security prison, and two such cell blocks were constructed. Work at Rockview then stopped as funds were put towards the construction of Graterford in the eastern part of the state. After several years of deliberation, it was decided that the building of more maximum security facilities was unnecessary and the cells at Rockview were restructured to follow a medium and minimum security plan, with Rockview operating as a branch of Western Penitentiary. Interestingly, one of the later penological criticisms of Western Penitentiary was that while Warden Wright did implement an inmate classification policy, all cells were built to maximum security standards and there were no provisions for inmates incarcerated for lesser offenses, though they made up the majority of inmates. The same mistake was almost made at Rockveiw but it was remedied before completion this time. In yet another improvement upon one of Western Penitentiary's planning issues, a rural site was chosen for Rockview so it could operate as a farm colony, which was in line with more progressive ideas of prison architecture and operation. When the Riverside facility was being planned, the trend to build prisons in rural sites was already popular. Thought was initially given to build the third Western Penitentiary in this manner, but cost and transportation conveniences ultimately took precedence, and the House of Refuge site was chosen instead (Time Will Tell, James Rada Jr.).An additional obstacle, which originated outside of Western State Penitentiary but affected it directly, was restrictive inmate labor legislation passed in the 1890s. This legislation\u2014discussed in detail below\u2014severely curtailed Western State's ambitious program to rehabilitate inmates through industry and prevented the prison from earning enough income to offset its expenses. Together, all of these hardships helped renew earlier arguments that the ideal prison would be located in a rural setting. John Francies became warden of Western State in 1909 and appealed to the PA legislature to move the penitentiary to a better location. In 1911, the legislature passed an act authorizing the procurement of a rural site, and after surveying dozens of possibilities throughout the state, purchased 5000 acres in Centre County for Rockview State Prison. Originally, this was planned to be a maximum-security replacement for Western State Penitentiary; in 1915, new legislation stipulated that Rockview was to replace Eastern State Penitentiary, as well. However, under Governor Gifford Pinchot in the 1920s, the plan was revised, and Rockview was designated as a medium-security \"farm colony\" of Western State, meaning that it operated as a branch of the older penitentiary which was administered by the same warden. Both Western State Riverside and Eastern State Penitentiaries remained in use well into the 20th century.United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Section 8 Page 119 1926 Sanborn Map Figure 88. 1926 Sanborn Map showing the rebuilt East Wing and 3 new machine shops in the north half of the site following a major riot and fire in 1921.

Photograph of Overseers and an Interpreter at Western Penitentiary showing appointment dates from 1920 and 1921 (PA State Archives).In 1921, a riot and fire destroyed most of the East Wing and the buildings in the northern half of the site. By the time of this 1926 Sanborn Map, the central portion of the East Wing had been rebuilt to a modified design on the previous footprint. The long northern arm of the East Wing, which housed the dining room and stocking factory, burned and was replaced with a new dining hall, wider than the previous structure, at the same location. It connected to the East Wing through a small passage. The machine shop, mat factory, and warehouse in the northern end also burned and were replaced with three large identical shop buildings oriented east-west. Between the Tailoring Shop and Tag Shop was a small electrical Substation. To make room for the new shops, the broom factory was shortened on its northern end. Due to the larger footprints of the new buildings in the northern part of the site, the yard became smaller. This map illustrates a number of changes in the southern half of the site as well. Most of the Warehouse south of the Power Plant was demolished, save for a small portion. A large addition was built at the southern end of the Hospital in 1922. A school was built between the Hospital and the former Female Ward. The female inmates at the penitentiary were transferred to the State Industrial School for Women in Muncy, PA (now called SCI Muncy) in 1920. Women transferred from Eastern State Penitentiary were still housed at Western Penitentiary for a short time after, and all women were vacated from the site by 1922. After the women left, the cell block was converted for use as the Isolation Ward. A few small buildings were constructed along the southern half of the east wall. A water tower was built on the southern side of the East Wing. United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Section 8 Page 121 The riot of 1921 destroyed over a dozen buildings in the central and northern part of the site. According to the Inspectors of the penitentiary, the riot was caused by inmate idleness and lack of recreation, which fueled discontent, originating from a group of inmates recently transferred from Eastern State Penitentiary and Bellefonte. The idleness gave them time to plot a prison takeover, which started in the dining hall, pictured below. Fires were started in several buildings and spread to the Main Penitentiary Building where inmates armed with iron bars and bricks torn from the prison walls fought against the guards. Fifty inmates made their way to the rooftop, where they thew bricks down upon the firemen. The order to fire upon the rioters was finally given and the riot was eventually contained. The buildings destroyed by fire were the Dining Hall, Weaving Shop, Machine Shop, Broom Shop, Shoe Shop, Chapel, Large Storage House and four smaller ones, Kitchen, and two lookout towers. Figure 90.

Photo showing the penitentiary ca. 1940, looking west (University of Pittsburgh Archives Service Center). 29 Ashe, in McWilliams, 34.This 1939 aerial view shows that a dense urban environment by now surrounded the penitentiary. The location of the Roberta Lang parklet and public swimming pool close to the northeastern section of the wall demonstrates how integrated the site was into the neighborhood at this time. The most significant change since 1926 was the eastward expansion of the penitentiary boundary in response to frequent flooding in the early 1930s. The wall, which originally ended at Refuge St., now extended to what was Monhagen (formerly Matilda) St. In the higher ground captured by this expansion, three new buildings were built with WPA funds in 1939. From north to south, they are: the maintenance and welding shop, the boiler plant and power house, and the new hospital building. The Broom Factory's southern end had been demolished. The former electric plant had been expanded and converted to a gymnasium. South of the Gym, a new Dining Room was built in 1931. West of the North Wing is the Warden's Garage, built ca. 1930. The warden's chauffeur lived in a small, state-owned house just outside the prison at the corner of Refuge and Eckert Streets. During the mid-20th century, work on the physical plant of Western State Penitentiary all but ceased. This was a period of statewide reflection, assessment, and restructuring in the penological system of Pennsylvania and the role of Western State. In 1944, anticipating an increase in crime when servicemen returned home after World War II, Governor Edward Martin appointed a five-member commission to study Pennsylvania's correctional system and make recommendations to once again \"place Pennsylvania in the forefront of the treatment of crime and delinquency.\" 29 The commission was headed by Stanley P. Ashe, the well- respected warden at Western State Penitentiary who had become a nationally recognized penologist. United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Section 8 Page 124 Figures 95 and 96. Photos of Western Penitentiary in 1936 during flood conditions. The penitentiary flooded frequently and these photos show the need to move the administration buildings to the highest possible location, which was to the east of the old wall. In the March \"St. Patrick's Day Flood of 1936,\" the waters reached as high as the second floor ceiling of the Warden's Residence. According to Barnes, inmates had to be housed in unheated cells in the upper tiers of the cell blocks. The heating plant was out of commission and boats had to be employed to bring in supplies (Photo Story of the Greatest Flood in History, March 17-19, 1936, Harry H. Hamm). 30 Ashe, in McWilliams, 35.The Ashe report reaffirmed the commitment to rehabilitation that Warden Wright had championed at the opening of WSP Riverside 50 years before (and that had motivated later, Progressive-era reformers to advocate for training schools, reformatories, women's prisons, and rural farm compounds). However, its assessment of the current state of corrections in Pennsylvania system was bleak, finding that \"for many years nothing constructive either as to building or housing has been done within the Commonwealth.\" Pennsylvania would have to \"start practically from scratch if it is going to surpass, or even catch up with, a number of states in the union.\" 30 The principal recommendation of the Ashe commission was to abolish the Eastern and Western district plan and replace it with a unified statewide Bureau of Corrections, governed by a central administration.United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Section 8 Page 125 Figure 97. Drawing of Stanley P. Ashe. Ashe was warden of Western Penitentiary for 26 years, from 1924 to 1950. Prior to becoming warden, he was a school superintendent in Connellsville, PA. Ashe was a firm believer in education and implemented a robust educational policy while warden, including requiring every inmate to finish a 6th grade education before being allowed prison recreational activities. In 1944, Ashe headed a committee formed to investigate the state's correctional system. This report recommended that the state's correctional facilities be unified under a central Bureau of Corrections, and that Western Penitentiary be abandoned due to its deteriorating state. Unfortunately, most of his recommendations went unheeded in Pennsylvania, though they were put into action in other states, including California and New York. His report was taken more seriously after the 1953 riots at Western Penitentiary and Rockview. Many of his suggestions were noted in the Devers report, one of them being the creation of a central inmate classification center. Ashe was a prominent penologist and belonged to the American Prison Society and served as President of the National Wardens Association. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette described Ashe as \"one of the best penologists in the nation\" (Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, 10/01/1954, pg. 11; image The Pittsburgh Press, 03/05/1933). 31 Ashe, 56-57. 32 McWilliams, 35. Figure 98. Photograph showing the building of the hospital, 1938 (Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania, obtained through Historic Pittsburgh).Regarding Western State Penitentiary in particular, the commission's characterization differed little from the conditions Warden Francies had decried 50 years before: [Western State stands] in a a dirty, fog-ridden industrial district where there is an ever-present flood menace. The soot and dirt and smoke are often so thick that electric lights must be burned all day long. In some years, the Ohio River overflows its banks two or three times, flooding the prison yard and damaging equipment and utilities. 31 The commission estimated that it would take over $1 million to repair damage to WSP Riverside from flooding and to upgrade inadequate facilities. It recommended no further investment in the facility beyond immediate needs and repairs, and that the prison be kept open only temporarily to accommodate the anticipated swell in inmates after World War II. Most of the Ashe Commission's recommendations were not implemented. Instead, funds were prioritized for the state's psychiatric hospitals, which were found in even worse condition than the penitentiaries. 32United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Section 8 Page 126Figure 99.

Photos of the Chapel of the Good Samaritan, constructed in 1942. 100 inmates worked for a year to build the chapel, which was created from the ruins of the hospital wing that stood at the site previously. The interior furnishings were donated by interested persons outside the penitentiary. The chapel was demolished for the 1984 penitentiary master plan (Pittsburgh Post Gazette, 06/27/1942, p. 13).

State Troopers were called in to help quell the riot (Pittsburgh Press, 1/19/53, pp. 1 & 10). 33 Devers, \"Report of the Committee Appointed by Honorable John S. Fine, Governor to Investigate the Peno-Correctional System of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania\" (1953), PA State Archive, 21-23. The only major change to the campus during World War II was the demolition of the original hospital, located between the East Wing and the Female Ward. A new chapel was built in that location in 1942, and was partially constructed from the 1922 hospital addition. There was also an addition to the warden's garage outside the secure perimeter. As anticipated, crime rates did rise in the post-World War II period. Incidents at Western State and its farm colony, Rockview, in the early 1950s prompted another state inquiry into conditions in Pennsylvania's prisons. On November 30, 1952, eight prisoners managed to escape from Western State by climbing through its roof during a riot. Then, on January 18, 1953, a fire broke out in the shop buildings, and prisoners rioted, feeding the flames and holding five correctional officers hostage. Two days later, a similar incident, with fires deliberately set, occurred at Rockview. Governor John S. Fine appointed a special commission, headed by Jacob A. Devers, to study the state's correctional facilities and make recommendations for the system's improvement. Like the Ashe report, the Devers report concluded that Pennsylvania needed a centralized, unified administration for its correctional system. This time, state legislators acted. On July 29, 1953, Governor Fine signed a law creating the autonomous Bureau of Corrections under the direction of the attorney general. With oversight of all of the institutions in the Pennsylvania system, the Bureau (elevated to cabinet-level status and renamed the Department of Corrections in 1984) replaced the old system of prisons governed by individual boards of trustees who reported to the Department of Welfare and provided for continuity in policy across political administrations. The use of the term \"corrections\" also reflected a national trend, in which the American Prison Association in 1954 changed its name to the American Correctional Association and promoted the use of the terms \"correctional institution\" and \"correctional officer.\" Pennsylvania followed suit in 1955, and its penal institutions were re-designated State Correctional Institutions, or SCIs. Wardens became superintendents. This nomenclature connoted professionalism and a therapeutic purpose to incarceration that was more humane than the punitive \"prison,\" militaristic \"guard,\" or custodial \"warden.\" Where Western State Penitentiary was concerned, the commission found both it and its counterpart, Eastern State Penitentiary, to be \"crowded and inadequate.\" Nevertheless, the commission recommend \"that the two old penitentiaries be retained with alterations and changes,\" such as reducing capacity by diverting all but maximum-security inmates to other institutions and improving facilities for recreation and sanitation. 33 These recommendations do not appear to have been implemented, likely due to lack of funding.United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Section 8 Page 128 Ca. 1962 Site Aerial Figure 102. 1962 aerial showing the removal of the main penitentiary building's Victorian roof.

Photograph of unnamed inmate in the Main Penitentiary building (Pittsburgh Post Gazette, 1978).Western State Penitentiary\u2014now renamed SCI Pittsburgh\u2014remained open, but state investment in the prison slowed virtually to a halt between the 1940s and 1980s. A sally port\u2014a secured exit\u2014in the southeast corner of the wall was enlarged in 1951. In the southern part of the site, the ca. 1870 house that was used as the female ward since the late 1880s and Isolation Ward since the mid-1920's was demolished; however, the ca. 1890 cell block addition remained. The three shops in the northern end of the site were connected to form one large industrial space in 1957. The dining hall received an addition ca. 1957. The most significant change during this period occurred in 1959, when the original roof of the main penitentiary was removed, stripping it of its Victorian flourishes. This 1962 aerial view shows the flat roof that replaced it and is still in place today. The interior of the Rotunda was also modified the same year as a result of the Devers report, which recommended that a diagnostic and classification center be created. To accommodate this new service, a third and fourth floor were inserted into the Rotunda. Omitted from the previous historic maps was the Sewage Pump House, which is located outside the secure perimeter in the northwestern corner of the site. It was built in 1941 and can clearly be seen in the 1962 aerial photo. The photo also shows that the penitentiary was still oriented toward the river at this time, with the main parking lot in front.United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Section 8 Page 130 The 1950s and 60s were a time of unrest at Western Penitentiary, as they were at many prisons across the country. In 1952, violent riots broke out in eight different prisons in the U.S. On January 18, 1853, a fire broke out in the shops of Western Penitentiary, triggering a riot where inmates held five officers hostage. Days later, about 400 inmates held six officers hostage at Rockview for several days. The riots, coupled with an escape attempt the previous year, prompted a serious investigation into Western Penitentiary and Rockview through a committee headed by Jacob Devers. The various inquiries into the conditions of the penitentiary and treatment of inmates apparently led to little change, as reports of inhumane conditions plagued the penitentiary throughout the 1970s and 80s. In 1973, local NAACP head, state legislator K. Leroy Irvis, created a task force to investigate the mistreatment and killing of black men at the penitentiary. In 1987 a fire in the prison's auditorium and following riot prompted three inmates to file suit against the penitentiary for inhumane conditions. The suit was addressed by U.S. District Judge Maurice Cohill Jr., who ordered major change to what he called \"an overcrowded, unsanitary, and understaffed firetrap.\" He called for plans to address the overcrowding and staff issues, and also to replace the main penitentiary block, which was the oldest part of the prison. The main block was never demolished, and though the prison was closed in 2005, it reopened in 2007 as a lower security facility (Pittsburgh Post Gazette). Figure 105 (above left), figure 106 (above). The photographs on the page document an inmate protest that took place at the Western Penitentiary in June of 1962. An inmate named Robert Payne broke free from the guards after a false trip to the infirmary and climbed the 80 foot water tower in front of the East Wing. When reporters converged at the scene, Payne cited his unhappiness with conditions in \"the hole\" which was by this time housed in the former Female Ward. Payne stated that he would not come down until a full investigation into conditions at the penitentiary was undertaken. twelve more inmates were able to climb the tower the following day, where they wrote messages to the public on the tower. Three of the inmates lasted almost a week on the tower, with the last inmate coming down on the seventh day. Warden Maroney promised the inmates they would get a chance to air their grievances regarding the conditions at the penitentiary (Pittsburgh Post Gazette).United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Section 8 Page 131Figure 107. 1993 aerial photograph showing major changes to the site under the 1984 master plan by architect Tasso Katselas.

The 1980s and early 1990s saw the most dramatic changes to the site since the 1920s. A new master plan for the prison was completed by Pittsburgh architect and planner Tasso Kastelas in 1984 as part of a joint venture with Henningson, Durham & Richardson. In 1985, the penitentiary underwent a major renovation, resulting in the construction of four new buildings. An Administration and Visitors Complex with a parking lot was built was built in the southeastern part of the site to serve as the new entrance and inmate processing center, reorienting the prison to the neighborhood at its east rather than the riverfront at its west. This 1993 aerial view shows how this neighborhood around the penitentiary changed as a result of urban renewal and highway construction between the 1960s and 1980s. The alignment of Beaver Ave. shifted significantly closer to the site. Most of the residences that once crowded the prison's vicinity were demolished to make way for larger industrial works.United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Section 8 Page 133 Figure 109. 1980 aerial photograph of Western Penitentiary and surrounding area, showing the site prior to the 1984 master plan (SCI-Pittsburgh Facilities Archive).Within the southern end of the secure perimeter were built two new hourglass- shaped cell blocks, Housing Units A and B. Their construction reduced the size of the recreation yard in this area of the campus. The original North and South cell blocks were divided in half for security purposes, and the windows in each cell of the south cell block were bricked over to permit a new ventilation system. Iron barred cell doors were replaced with centrally-controlled mechanical doors. The fourth new building was the Institution Warehouse, located outside the secure perimeter at the middle of the eastern wall, very close to the public swimming pool. A new water tower was also built outside of the wall in 1966 adjacent to the North Wing; this replaced the previous water tower on the interior of the compound, which 13 inmates had ascended and painted in protest for a week in 1962. In this 1993 aerial photo, a cleared area can be seen at the northwestern corner of the site, on which the Vehicle Maintenance building would be constructed later that year.United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Section 8 Page 134 2018 Satellite View Figure 110. 2018 satellite view showing the final building constructed at the penitentiary site, which is the Health Services Building in the southeast corner of the Secure Perimeter bump-out (Google Maps).United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Section 8 Page 13534 Emily McConville, \"As Shutdown of SCI Pittsburgh Nears, Inmates and Staff Move Elsewhere\" (Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, June 9, 2017) http://www.post-gazette.com/local/ city/2017/06/09/SCI-Pittsburgh-closing- western-penitentiary-closure-state-prison- 111. Headline and photograph from the TribLive, 06/11/17.In the 1980s, Western State's inmate population reached 2200, far exceeding capacity and provoking a federal lawsuit. A 1989 decision by U.S. District Judge Maurice B. Cohill, Jr. declared conditions at the prison unsafe and unconstitutional, leading the state to spend over $100 million on improvements. The most visible of these was the new Health Services Building which replaced the former hospital building on the eastern side of the complex in 1994. In this 2018 satellite view, the Vehicle Maintenance building in the northwestern end of the complex can be seen in completion. Western State Penitentiary closed in 2004-2005, only to reopen in response to the state's high inmate population in 2007. It became a lower-security facility for inmates assigned to complete specialized programs before parole or release. The penitentiary closed permanently in 2017. Reasons cited by the state included high operating costs, relatively low community impact of closure, lower prison populations statewide, and the possibility of redeveloping its riverfront site. 34United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Section 8 Page 13635 Barnes, \"The Evolution of American Penology as Illustrated by the Western Penitentiary,\" 191.Evaluation of Significance: Criterion A Western State Penitentiary is recommended eligible for the National Register under Criterion A for its exemplification of a variety of penological reforms which contributed to Pennsylvania's leadership in the treatment of prisoners and design of modern prisons during the 19th century. Because this theme does not fit neatly into one of the National Register's established Areas of Significance, the Area of Significance for this resource is Other: Penology. As compared to Eastern State Penitentiary, Western State Penitentiary had a progressive administration that sought to implement broad reforms in prison management during the late 19th century. Evidence of this begins with Western State's condemnation of the Pennsylvania System of solitary confinement in 1866, even as it continued at Eastern State. Several influential reformers were appointed to positions at Western State in the late 1860s and contributed to a culture of progressivism in its administration through the end of the 19th century: Theodore Nevin, who served as Chairman of Western State's Board of Inspectors from 1867 to 1884; Edward Wright, warden of Western State Penitentiary from 1869 to 1901; and Rev. John L Milligan, prison chaplain from 1869 to 1909. Inspectors' reports and other writings through the turn of the 20th century show that these individuals and the Board of Inspectors of Western State held progressive ideas about prison management and were energetic in supporting new and experimental ideas in penology. They were aware of international trends in prison reform, participated in national discussions of best penological practice, and subscribed to views of the prison as not only a place of punishment, but as a humanitarian institution for \"curing\" criminals so that they could be reintroduced to society. This belief depended on an enlightened view of human beings as neither inherently bad nor good, but able to be influenced by such environmental factors as education, employment, and their surroundings. Wright's term (1869-1901), in particular, spanned the final decade of WSP Commons and the (overlapping) first two decades of WSP Riverside and coincided with the introduction of a number of major ideas about prison reform on a national level. Wright and the Inspectors advocated for Western State's move to the Riverside site as an opportunity to pursue innovations in the housing, treatment, employment, and reform of inmates. There, they did not merely implement an Auburn-style system, but updated and adapted it to reflect their approach to rehabilitation and reintroduction of inmates to society. In particular, Wright implemented significant progressive reforms in sentencing practices, the classification of convicts, and education. He also pursued a dedicated program of inmate labor in the belief that this gave prisoners structured activity, meaningful work, and vocational skills that would benefit them upon release. Led by Wright, Western State Penitentiary emerged as a leader in penology during the late 19th century. In 1921, historian Harry Elmer Barnes wrote that Western State Penitentiary \"has much more [than Eastern State Penitentiary] adequately exemplified the historical development of American penal institutions, and, since 1870, has been much the more advanced and more progressive of the two penitentiaries.\" 35United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Section 8 Page 137 Figure 112.

An alternate view of Warden Wright and his humane vision for Western State Penitentiary is presented by Andrew Berkman, who was incarcerated there from 1893-1905 for his attempt to assassinate Henry Clay Frick. Berkman's accusations of inmate abuse at WSP Riverside prompted an investigation into conditions at the prison, which did not result in charges against Warden Wright. See Alexander Berkman, Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist (New York: New York Review of Books, 1999).Though founded on the principles of the Auburn System, which were generally held to represent a progressive evolution from the Pennsylvania System, WSP Riverside actually implemented even more humanitarian reforms than the model it followed. For instance, to maintain discipline among inmates, the Auburn System prescribed strict policies of silence in congregate spaces and marching in lockstep when prisoners moved in groups. Such practices originated in military theories of stripping individuals' sense of self to make them obedient members of a group. Like the Pennsylvania System, the Auburn System was based in the belief that criminal behavior was learned and reinforced through the interactions of inmates, and so strove to eliminate all such opportunities. Inmates were not even allowed to look at one another, and punishments for infractions were severe and, often, physical. As the 19th century progressed, many prison reformers, including the administrators of Western State, began to question some of the harsher aspects of the Auburn System. For instance, Warden Wright abolished the \"humiliating lockstep\" in 1897, three years before Auburn itself did. 36 The rule of silence also appears not to have been enforced at Western State; according to Chaplain Milligan, \"The unnatural isolation was not looked upon favorably by the progressive Board of Inspectors and the kind-hearted warden.\" 37 Information about corporal punishment at WSP Riverside has not been found. Warden Wright subscribed to the idea that a penitentiary was a place of reform, as held by both the Auburn and Pennsylvania systems, but he also believed that more than silent contemplation would be needed to achieve this. Accordingly, he worked to make WSP Riverside an institution that prepared inmates for success upon release through educational and vocational programs, meaningful labor, and humane treatment. In his \"Brief History of the Western State Penitentiary,\" apparently addressed to a future warden and/or inspectors, Wright admonished, \"Do a little of the trusting yourselves instead of discharging from cellular confinement with a very small gratuity, shabby clothing and a Goodby, and then wonder why the poor fellow cannot get work....Let the State do part of the preparation for an honest life.\" 38 Wright also held broader beliefs about reform, not only of prisons, but of the entire criminal justice system. In a contemporary debate over reform ideology in the penitentiary system, Wright argued against administering prisons separately from courts and law enforcement. He saw justice as interrelated with penology and advocated for whole system reforms, such as indeterminate sentencing and parole. 39 (This view would be reflected, much later, in the state's establishment of a Bureau of Corrections under the Attorney General in 1953.) The writings of Harry Elmer Barnes provide a useful framework for further discussion and evaluation of penological reform as practiced at Western State Penitentiary. A leading historian of penology in the 19th and early 20th centuries, Barnes authored a number of articles on prison reform in Pennsylvania, some of which specifically focus on Western State. In 1922, Barnes enumerated a list of \"chief advances in penological concepts and practices, by common consent among penologists\" of the 19th and early 20th centuries. 40 Major prison reforms named by Barnes and implemented during this period at Western State Penitentiary included:United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Section 8 Page 13841 Barnes, \"The Progress of American Penology,\" 193.Commutation and Indeterminate Sentences: Commutation of sentence is a form of clemency in which a prisoner's original sentence may be reduced at the discretion of correctional officers. It is related to the concept of the indeterminate sentence, which has a prescribed maximum, but can be adjusted based on extenuating circumstances, such as good conduct or evidence of rehabilitation. Both ideas rely on the principle of early release as an incentive for good behavior. By giving inmates some control over their own release, wardens hoped to supply a powerful inducement to complete educational and other programs offered by the penitentiaries to aid their rehabilitation. Such sentencing reforms were founded in the Irish System of incarceration, developed by Irish prison reformer Sir Walter Crofton in the mid-19th century, in which prisoners graduated through a tiered system of classification to earn their release. Influential in the United States during the post-Civil War period, Sir Crofton spoke about the Irish System at the first meeting of the National Prison Association, formed to advocate for the more humane treatment of inmates and better prisons, in Cincinnati in 1870. Warden Wright attended this meeting along with the Western State Inspectors. The laws in Pennsylvania did not support a complete adoption of the Irish System, but Wright and the Inspectors of Western State strove to incorporate aspects of Crofton's teachings where they could. The earliest commutation law appeared at Auburn State Prison in New York in 1817, but it was specific to that institution; commutation laws weren't used widely in the United States until much later. The first commutation law in Pennsylvania appeared in 1861 and was opposed by the Inspectors at both Eastern and Western State Penitentiaries, who had the law deemed unconstitutional. However, prison reform advocates persisted in advocating for such policies and a new law was enacted on May 21, 1869, directing wardens to keep records of prisoner conduct and to reduce sentences by set amounts based on the length of time the inmate remained in good standing. This law stood until 1901. Pennsylvania's commutation law was, therefore, in effect for the exact duration of warden Wright's tenure at at Western State. In contrast to the Inspectors at Eastern State, who were critical of Pennsylvania's commutation law, Western State's Inspectors supported it, perhaps due to their personal exposure to Sir Walter Crofton. Western State Penitentiary's annual and biennial Inspectors' Reports of the 1880s contain frequent mentions of commutation as an important strategy for motivating obedient conduct. Classification of Convicts: The practice of classifying and separating convicts according to behavior was another aspect of the Irish System about which Sir Walter Crofton spoke in Cincinnati in 1870. By this system, an inmate gradually advanced from solitary confinement to greater degrees of freedom, depending upon behavior and participation in reformatory activities. In the United States, this type of classification system was pioneered at the Elmira Reformatory in NY in 1869. While Eastern State Penitentiary had a rudimentary classification system that was not very effective, \"[i]n the Western Penitentiary the official setting was much better adapted for an open-minded and favorable reception of the system of classification associated with Crofton's methods.\" 41 At WSP Commons, United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Section 8 Page 139Figure 113. Chaplain J. L. Milligan was born in Ickesburg, PA in 1837. He completed his religious education at Princeton Theological Seminary, and then volunteered in the Civil War, first with an agency of the YMCA and then as chaplain from 1863-1865. After the War he moved to Wisconsin for several years before being recommended for the vacant post of chaplain at Western Penitentiary, which he took in 1869. He became very involved in prison reform and was a charter member of the National Prison Association, later becoming secretary until his retirement in 1908, and was also a charter member in the Allegheny County Prison Society, serving several years as president. Additionally, Chaplain Milligan was elected representative to the U.S. at the International Prison Congress for 6 different congresses. He served as chaplain of the penitentiary until 1909, after which he was named chaplain emeritus due to poor health. He died of a stroke on July 12, 1909 (PA State Archives). 42 Inspectors of the Western Penitentiary, \"Annual Report of the Inspectors of the Western Penitentiary for the Western District of Pennsylvania\" (Pittsburgh: State Penitentiary for the Western District of Pennsylvania, 1881-2), 8. Warden Wright and the inspectors created a simple method of inmate classification after attending the first National Prison Association Congress in 1870; their system was a combination of the Pennsylvania, Auburn, and Irish systems, with three grades of cells based on inmate behavior. However, space limitations at the Commons site meant they were not able to enact a classification system that was as progressive as they would like. The Riverside facility allowed the inspectors and Warden Wright the ability to further advance their reforms regarding inmate classification. Riverside was built with a number of larger cells, which were to be used by the \"better class of prisoners, and their occupancy to be secured only as a reward for merit.\" 42 By 1892, when the South wing was complete enough to house inmates, the system of the inmate classification was fully adopted at Riverside. Warden Wright's report of 1889-90 explains the system. Convicts entered in the second grade. Six months of good behavior allowed them to advance to the first grade, which had special privileges, including: housing in larger cells in the new South wing, being allowed one more hour of light in cells at night, freedom from marching in lock-step and wearing prison stripe, and obtaining the benefits of commutation law. Major misconduct resulted in reduction to third grade, from which the inmate had to work back up by good conduct. The Warden reported that the system had worked well and had been retained. After 1915, exceptionally good behavior was rewarded with transfer of the inmate to Rockview. The classification system was effective in combination with Wright's simultaneous program of inmate labor, discussed below, because work gave prisoners a focus for positive conduct for which they could be recognized. Legislation limiting prison labor disrupted the effectiveness of the classification system at Western State by promoting idleness and removing a primary means by which inmates earned promotions. Inmate Instruction: According to Barnes, appropriate instruction of inmates included religious, moral, academic, vocational and social education and was a component of a progressive program of prison reform. Barnes notes that Western State was behind Eastern State Penitentiary in instructional reform, possibly due to the fact that Eastern State had guidance from the Philadelphia Society for Alleviating the Miseries of Public Prisons. Western State's shortcomings in this regard were not for lack of trying. Prison reports from the 19th century illustrate the history of efforts by Western State's administrators to implement various aspects of educational programming. Starting in 1839, WSP Commons employed a \"moral instructor,\" who was responsible for the moral and intellectual education of the convicts. Of particular importance was the appointment as Chaplain of Rev. John L Milligan in 1869, the same year as Warden Wright. Milligan was a like-minded proponent of penological reform and Secretary of the National Prison Association for 20 years. The number of moral instructors increased to four at Riverside, who also served Rockview penitentiary, and represented Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish faiths. The commitment of prison administrators to inmates' moral instruction is shown by the Inspectors' repeated requests, in their reports of the 1890s, for funds to build a chapel in the yard.United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Section 8 Page 140 Figure 114. Photograph of the North Yard in 1897, showing several of the labor shops. From front to back, the Greenhouse, Machine Shop (also called the Construction Shop) and the Mat Factory (Mylin, State Prisons, Hospitals, Soldiers' Homes).Warden Wright's support of the congregate aspects of the Auburn System and the congregate labor law of 1869 allowed inmates to be gathered for both labor and instructional purposes. This made it possible for academic classes to be organized at WSP Commons in 1873. The penitentiary employed a school teacher from 1873 until 1881 and had about 700 students enrolled by 1880. The day school re-opened in 1886, with about 89 students enrolled and trained prison officers serving as teachers. The 1897-98 Inspectors report shows 112 students enrolled in the school at 4 hours of tuition each week. The penitentiary school had periods of success; enrollment was largely dependent upon the number of inmates able to be employed in convict labor. Western State Penitentiary also had a large library. It started with about 100 books in 1840 at WSP Commons; by 1896 at the Riverside site, there were over 9000 volumes. The possibilities of vocational education were closely tied to inmate labor legislation, which over time limited the number of prisoners who could work and at what kinds of machines. Barnes notes that nothing of importance in vocational training happened at Western State Penitentiary due to these factors. Convict Labor: Though not listed in Barnes' catalog of penological reforms, a robust program of inmate labor was a major component of Western State Penitentiary's reformatory practice. The vocational activities of inmates were supposed to serve two important purposes: to provide prisoners with meaningful occupation to aid in their rehabilitation, and to enable the prison to be financially self-sustaining. Throughout the history of Western State Penitentiary, laws, practices, and attitudes toward inmate labor both influenced and were constrained by the facility at the Riverside site. Prison labor had a long and controversial history both before and after its initiation at WSP Riverside. In the 1700s, laws ordering Pennsylvania prisoners put to hard labor were repealed on the grounds that they were cruel and humiliating. The first experiment with industry inside a prison occurred at the Walnut Street Jail, where prisoners were given hand work to perform in solitary confinement; this was successful until the prison became overcrowded. The 1818 act that established Eastern and Western State Penitentiaries contained no labor provisions, but a subsequent law amended sentencing to include hard labor, to be performed in cells in solitude. This act contributed to the failure of the first Western State Penitentiary, whose cells\u2014constructed before the act was passed\u2014were too small and dark for work. The industrial revolution rendered solitary handcrafts obsolete, and in 1869, a new act of the Pennsylvania legislature allowed inmates to congregate for the purposes of labor or religious services. This prompted the building of shops at WSP Commons in the 1870s to accommodate groups of prisoners and the heavy machinery they used for factory-style production. The chief industries at WSP Commons during this time were shoemaking, weaving, and making cane- seating for chairs. Inmate labor expanded in the 1870s with prisons entering into various relationships with the free market. A contract labor system emerged, in which prisoners were leased to private manufacturers for their labor. Somewhat more restrained was the Public Account System, in which the state purchased raw materials and machinery for its prisoners to produce goods, which it then sold. United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Section 8 Page 14143 Barnes, \"The Evolution of American Penology as Illustrated by the Western Penitentiary,\" 209. Figure 115. Photograph of inmates manufacturing license plates at Western Penitentiary in 1937. Products made through inmate labor evolved over time at Western Penitentiary. A few handicrafts were made by inmate in their cells, but most products were manufactured in the factory-like setting of the penitentiary's workshops. License plates, made in the Tag Plant (Building 11), were one of the notable goods manufactured on site, as well as metal office furniture and shoes (The Pittsburgh Press, 12/12/1937, p. 9).These systems were rife with possibilities for corruption of officials and exploitation of convicts, but the state interfered little in them. It was during this period that WSP Riverside was constructed. Its design reflected the intention to more fully accommodate the convict labor program started at WSP Commons by providing larger cells, more natural light, and numerous on-site workshops, including a machine shop, a blacksmith shop, and a shop for the making of heavy chains. The Inspectors' Reports of the 1880s frequently extolled the benefits of convict labor, and described the need for more and improved facilities to accommodate prison industries. It is clear that Warden Wright and the Inspectors embraced the congregate labor system as completely as permitted under Pennsylvania law. Historic property maps of the prison site, detailed above, illustrate the expansion and contraction of industrial activities on the site in the 1880s and 90s. Non-prison labor organizations led a backlash of increasing restrictions on inmate industry beginning in 1883. At first, the state ended the practice of contracting prisoners to private industries and ordered the branding of all prison-made goods. The most severe laws, passed in 1897, forbade the use of all machinery other than those which could be operated by foot-power and limited the number of inmates that could be employed to less than 20% of the prison's total population. The effects on WSP Riverside were numerous and far-reaching. The number of working inmates dropped dramatically, severely curtailing Warden Wright's ambitions to rehabilitate them through gainful employment. In their reports after 1897, the inspectors and warden pled repeatedly for inmate labor, arguing its value in preventing idleness, providing an alternative to misconduct, maintaining morale, and providing an opportunity for inmates to learn a vocation which would help them upon release. The new laws also resulted in financial hardship for Western State. Unable to compete with outside manufacturers, the penitentiary was limited to producing items which didn't require heavy machinery but also didn't make much money, such as cocoa mats, brooms, and hosiery. Loss of substantial income from inmate labor resulted in the need to appeal to the state for unmet needs, but funds were often not forthcoming. These laws were amended in 1915 with the establishment of the Pennsylvania Prison Labor Commission to set policies for the employment and compensation of all of the state's inmates. However, because it did not stipulate that the state must choose prison-made goods before privately-made goods, the commission did not restore a robust system of inmate labor. In 1921, Barnes wrote that \"after the restrictive legislation of 1883-97 [Western State Penitentiary] has become progressively more of a burden to the state. In 1916, for example, it created an economic burden of about three hundred and fifty thousand dollars.\" 43 Inadequate funds hindered the penitentiary's ability to keep pace with best practices in penology. In the 20th century, such practices shifted to more science-based, less humanitarian underpinnings. These changes coincided with the 1901 retirement of Warden Wright, who had led Western State's departure from the antiquated practices of the Pennsylvania System and the harshest tenets of Auburn. Thus Western State's period of progressive reform came to a close around 1900, although the prison remained open for more than 100 more years.United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Section 8 Page 14244 Roberts, 47.Evaluation of Significance: Criterion C Western State Penitentiary is recommended eligible for the National Register under Criterion C as a significant example of a Victorian-era penitentiary that combined historical architectural forms and methods of construction with modern advances in infrastructure, utilities, sanitation, and features of prison design influenced by the industrial revolution. Early American jails tended to have a domestic character that reflected their main purpose as houses of detention; they were not built for long-term incarceration or solitary confinement in individual cells. State penitentiaries of the early 19th century introduced new architectural forms designed for long- term cellular confinement on a large scale. Distinctive plans emerged in association with particular systems of incarceration: the circular panopticon, the radial Pennsylvania System, and the rectangular Auburn style. But the common concerns of all prisons\u2014isolation of prisoners from society and from one another, proper surveillance, and control of inmates' movements and routines\u2014together with the penitentiaries' monumental scale led to a common architectural design vocabulary intended to facilitate these goals. Many of the design features of early 19th century prisons were borrowed from military architecture, which likewise strove to make a statement about the authority of the state. The medieval referents of the Gothic Revival Style lent themselves to the fortress-like design of large prisons. Eastern State Penitentiary and both the first and second Western State buildings on Allegheny Commons displayed the Gothic Revival's characteristic heavy stone walls, castellated parapets, narrow or blind windows, and imposing watchtowers. The style was intimidating and suited the prison's needs to communicate and enforce security. Critics found this architecture to be demoralizing and dehumanizing for its occupants, however. 44 Built in the late 19th century, WSP Riverside maintained the tradition of monumentality and, of course, concerns about security and surveillance of its predecessors. But its Auburn System underpinnings, the reform agenda of its warden and inspectors, eclectic trends in late Victorian architecture, and modern building technologies resulted in a new and different prison design at WSP Riverside. Its riverfront location might also have influenced its design by inviting a linear approach to expose as many of the cells as possible to the fresh breezes off the water. Finally, the fact that the site had housed a previous state institution, a reform school for juvenile offenders known as the Pennsylvania House of Refuge, factored into the site's overall design. The same architect who had designed the House of Refuge, Edward M. Butz, was engaged to design WSP Riverside, and some of his previous buildings, such as the shops, dining hall, and school, were incorporated into the prison campus. Butz, in turn, hired Frederick Sauer, a young German architect with expertise in stone-cutting and brick-laying, to supervise parts of the work at Western State. Sauer would go on to establish his own practice in Pittsburgh and to design renovations to the Allegheny County Workhouse, a farm prison for minor offenders in O'Hara Township. Butz lived from ca. 1845-1916 and entered architecture as an apprentice at the age of 18.

Butz \"frequently partnered with engineers and never shied from technical jobs;\" he also co-founded and managed the Columbia Iron and Steel Company in the 1880s and collaborated on the design and marketing of a home furnace. 45 Other known, extant commissions include the Adam Reineman house, Troy Hill (ca. 1876), Sterrett School, Point Breeze (1878), and courthouses in Clarion and Fayette Counties. Butz also went on to design the Pennsylvania Reform School at Morganza, the successor to the House of Refuge. At WSP Riverside, Butz applied a pastiche of styles to \"the most advanced model of Auburn-type construction.\" 46 In fact, WSP Riverside was built well after prototypical examples and at a time when the model might have been waning had a more effective replacement been developed. Auburn State Penitentiary in New York, the prototype, opened in 1816, but Sing Sing, constructed by the warden of Auburn in 1825, provided the most influential architectural model. In 1949, the United States Bureau of Prisons noted that \"the Auburn system all but completely dominated the prison scene in the United States after 1850\" and that examples, including WSP Riverside, continued to be built even after the ideal was \"partly archaic and outmoded.\" 47 Around 35 Auburn-style institutions were constructed across the United States between 1825 and 1869, most of which remained in use in 1878 (and well thereafter). But if the idea was not new, its execution at WSP Riverside was, largely due to the architectural and technological possibilities of the late 19th century. The Auburn System seems to have been defined by function: Norman Johnston, an architectural historian of prisons, asserts that it was \"largely an indigenous creation of American reformers and builders\" that \"seems to have emerged largely out of pragmatic decisions... by men who had the day-to-day responsibilities of trying to contain in an orderly fashion the occupants of their institutions... a veritable machine to subdue and make self-supporting the occupants of the prison.\" 48 This view implies that the architects and administrators of individual prisons retained a large amount of discretion in how they composed and embellished the fundamental elements of the Auburn System of confinement. These were: long, multi-tiered, double rows of cells placed back-to-back; \"inside cells,\" or cell blocks completely enclosed within the larger building, surrounded by a corridor or range; and full-height ventilation spaces separating the cells from the cell block walls. Congregate spaces, such as dining halls and workshops, were located separately from the cell blocks within the prison campus, which was, of course, demarcated by prominent surrounding walls and overlooked by watchtowers. All of these features are found in Western State Penitentiary. Butz's design for WSP Riverside responds to both the programmatic prescriptions of the Auburn System and the desires of the warden and inspectors for a modern, humane, and progressive prison. The penitentiary consisted of a central rotunda connected to a pair of long wings, one extending north and the other south, each housing back-to-back Auburn-style cell blocks stacked five stories high. A third, T-shaped wing, two-and-a-half stories and extending eastward from the rotunda, contained shops and factories, the chapel, a school room, kitchen, laundry, and engine room off a double-loaded corridor. This arrangement allowed for two large yards in the rear of the prison, in which Butz planned for the future construction of a hospital, women's prison, and additional shop buildings to accommodate the administrators' ambitious goals United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Section 8 Page 144 Figure 116 (right). Drawing of Auburn Penitentiary in New York showing the main and rear facades. Auburn was built in 1817 and the origin of the \"Auburn System,\" a correctional system developed by Auburn warden Elam Lynds. It was based on inmates working in congregate workshop spaces during the day while being confined to cells at night, and replaced the Pennsylvania System of complete solitary confinement. Auburn also established a voluntary board of inspectors who were responsible for appointing the warden, a governing style that Western and Eastern Penitentiary followed. Architecturally, it was characterized by long cell blocks containing tiers of back to back cells; this plan required a large site to house both the cell blocks and the workshop spaces. It was hailed as a more progressive prison management model than the Pennsylvania System and soon became the default plan for all prisons in the United States. Auburn penitentiaries were also cheaper to build as they contained smaller cells, and its factory-like work environment enabled a high production of prison goods, which often rendered the prisons self-supporting, at least until restrictive labor laws came to pass in many states. Though Auburn was lauded as progressive, it was in actuality a harsh system under the direction of Elam Lynds. Lynds believed strongly in the necessity of breaking an inmate's spirit to gain compliance, and through compliance, be reformed. To this end, he often used corporal punishment, strictly enforced complete silence and made inmates march in lockstep. Lynds also did not believe in reform practices like providing inmate education. Though widely regarded as an innovator during his early years at Auburn and later Sing Sing (Lynds established Sing Sing and served as warden), Lynd's harsh methods were eventually seen as abusive, and he was fired from positions at both Auburn and Sing Sing. Warden Wright and the Board of Inspectors of Western Penitentiary did not seem to incorporate Lynd's harsh treatment of inmates, instead believing that reform was aided through humane treatment and programs that served to provide education and moral instruction(\"The History Blog\"). Figures 117 (bottom left) and 118 (bottom right). Photograph of Auburn cell block interior ca. 1910 on the left and Western Penitentiary cell block in 1897. A comparison of the cell blocks show how clearly the Western Penitentiary design was based in the Auburn system. Western Penitentiary, however, was built in a much more ornate manner, as shown in the elaborate cast-iron balcony brackets. This cell block design is a major departure from the plan of Eastern Penitentiary and the first Western Penitentiary in the Allegheny Commons (left: New York Correction History Society; right: Mylin, State Prisons, Hospitals, Soldiers' Homes).United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Section 8 Page 145 The images in this page show other state prison structures with similar designs to Western Penitentiary, including being based on the Auburn System. These penitentiaries, like Western State, follow the Auburn plan of long cell block arms with tiers of cells inside. Additionally, these penitentiaries exhibit a central administration/office/residence structure in front of the cell blocks. The penitentiaries showcase a common Victorian prison vocabulary, such as heavy, rusticated walls, repeating bays of tall Romanesque cell block windows, and elaborate rooflines. Figure 119 (top). Iowa Men's Reformatory (Anamosa State Penitentiary) in Anamosa, Iowa, built in 1839. The architect was William Foster and later Henry Franz Liebbe and Henry Jackson Liebbe. The central structure was built between 1892-1902 in the Gothic and Romanesque revival styles, and contained the warden's residence, dining hall, kitchen, and chapel. The south cell block was built between 1877-1881, and the north cell block between 1896-1910. The reformatory is listed in the National Register of Historic Places (Jones County Pages, Richard Harrison). Figure 120 (middle). Tennessee State Prison, Nashville, TN, built in 1898 by architect Samuel McClung Patton. The central building housed administrative offices and was connected to the main penitentiary building by a short passage in a similar fashion to the Warden's Residence and Rotunda passage at Western Penitentiary (though without the porte cochere). The prison was forced to close in 1992 after a federal lawsuit and court ruling determined the prison did not provide adequate living conditions for the inmates, which was similar to the lawsuit against Western Penitentiary in the late 1980's. Figure 121 (bottom). The Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield, Ohio, built between 1886 and 1896 in the Gothic Revival, Richardsonian Romanesque, and Queen Anne Styles by architect Levi T. Scofield. It has two central residence-style structures in front of the cell blocks. There are 6 tiers of cells inside the East Cell Block, making it the largest known structure of its kind. The prison began as a reformatory for young men and was later converted to a maximum-security prison and closed in 1984. The Ohio State Reformatory is listed in the National Register of Historic Places (The Ohio State Reformatory).United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Section 8 Page 146 Figure 122. 1905 detail of roofline of Western Penitentiary showing High Victorian Gothic elements. The red color of the roof slates is speculation by the artist who colored the original black-and-white image for the post card. 52 Johnston, 47.51 McWilliams, 35.50 In Ashe report, 17-18, nd.49 PhD., \"The Evolution of American Penology,\" 196.for inmate industry. To the front of the rotunda, facing the river, a four-story (plus high basement, in deference to the floodplain) warden's house was appended. This also contained the prison offices. Design of the warden's house as part of the prison was then common in penitentiary design, reflecting the Christian custom of housing clergy in a rectory on the property of a church. In style, Butz abandoned the militaristic, fortress-like Gothic Revival of the early Victorian period for an eclectic combination of severe Romanesque cell blocks and, above the cornice, highly decorative, even fanciful High Victorian Gothic dormers, turrets, soaring rooflines, and ornamental cresting. Barnes called it \"the most expensive and pretentious prison structure which had been erected in America.\" 49 The warden's house exhibits the asymmetrical massing, multi- faceted wall planes, and complex roofline typical of late Victorian houses, providing an interesting contrast of comfortable upper-middle-class domesticity against the repetitive, institutional backdrop of the cell block walls. Subtle trefoil motifs in some of the stone lintels of the warden's house reinforce the High Victorian Gothic treatment of the attic story of the prison. Romanesque\u2014a style characterized by the stolid, massive appearance of its heavy stone walls\u2014was an appropriately strong and sober choice for the cell blocks. The intricate, ornamental, almost palatial original roof is harder to explain. Perhaps it was an expression of the state's, and the warden's and Inspectors', lofty goals for the new Western State Penitentiary and its residents. A similar combination of institutional severity and artful flourishes is found in this undated description of conditions inside Western State Penitentiary from the late 19th century: Instruments of music are allowed and playing is permitted from six to seven o'clock in the evening. City water from Allegheny City reservoir supplies the entire establishment. The doors of the cells are double-locked by Yale jamb locks and a draw bar. The floors are of stone both in the halls and in the cells. The cells are numbered and each prisoner is known by his number. A greenhouse brightens the place bringing summer into winter, and blooming plants in great varieties are seen in the institution. A hospital for the sick is on the grounds, and the cleanliness of the whole institution is noticeable. 50 Part of the innovation of the late Victorian prison was its optimism that an environment conducive to rehabilitation could achieve that goal. When the penitentiary's Victorian roof elements were removed in 1959, the new flat roof was in keeping with the less-is-more architectural preferences of the time and surely reflected practical concerns with chronic funding shortages and deferred maintenance. Symbolically, the removal of the prison's ornamental roofscape left the formidable facades of the cell blocks to speak for themselves, a reminder that during the period from 1950-1984, \"rehabilitation fell out of favor.\" 51 Western State Penitentiary's innovations extended to its building systems and materials. At over two million dollars, it was not only the most expensive prison ever built, but the most technologically advanced. New developments in central heating, ventilating, and plumbing of large buildings found some of their earliest applications in the prisons of the first decades of the 19th century, 52 a trend led by Western State Penitentiary. It was piped for gas, water, and steam through-out and was the first prison in the world to equip each cell with running water, United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Section 8 Page 147 Photo 104.

Fine,\" 22.55 In Edward S. Wright, A Brief History of the Western Penitentiary (Pittsburgh, 1909), 107.individual toilets, and individual heat and exhaust ventilation. It was the first prison equipped with gang locks which made it possible to open and close an entire row of cells with a single lever. In 1900, after a decade of Inspectors' reports lamenting the inconvenience and expense of candle light, it also became the first prison to furnish each cell with electric lights from the penitentiary's own on-site power house. Such innovations not only increased the comfort of prisoners and staff, but enhanced security as well. In-cell plumbing meant fewer risks associated with opening cell doors, while adequate ventilation, heat and light reduced tensions that could lead to unrest. 53 The technological advances of the industrial revolution also supplied important materials for innovations in prison design. Cast iron is a particular example seen at Western State Penitentiary; its decreasing cost made its extensive use possible, not only for columns, but for doors, windows, roof trusses, and cell bars. 54 As a partner in an iron and steel concern (which was purchased in 1895 by Andrew Carnegie), architect Butz may have been instrumental in guiding decisions about materials. Writing in 1895, Alexander K. Pedrick, Secretary of the Pennsylvania Commission on Convict Labor, opined that Western State Penitentiary \"is considered by those familiar with its merits as an admirable type of modern prison architecture and in its details of treatment, labor, and reformatory results, it certainly stands very high among the correctional institutions of the country.\" 55 After about 1900, Western State Penitentiary ceased to innovate and, instead, adapted to changing needs: in inmate labor requirements and restrictions, population, and state penal policy and governance. Repeated calls for its closure were perhaps best refuted by the Devers Report of 1953, which observed that the condition of being old did not, in itself, create undesirable conditions such as overcrowding and poor sanitation, and directed its recommendations toward strategic management of the correctional system, as a whole, and of Western State Penitentiary in particular. 56 No architectural or managerial solutions ever eliminated all of the problems of the large, urban state penitentiary, but Western State continued to function as an integral part of the Pennsylvania corrections system through the early 21st century.United States Department of the Interior National Park Service / National Register of Historic Places Registration Form Western State PenitentiaryNPS Form 10-900 OMB Control No. 1024-0018 Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Section 8 Page 1489.
