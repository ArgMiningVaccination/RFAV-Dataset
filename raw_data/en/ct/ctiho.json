With no wish to enter the arena, we merely state our belief that qualified prof~ssionals, especially scholars in the sciences and arts, should h~v.e a knoWletd~~.oft~he h~~~~Yt~! \" e ective fields. This is equally true for medlcme, even a IS lme . ~~~~a~yS~mphasis is on the immediate application of the latest methods and techmques. Among the voices which support our view we may cit.e .Professor ~. ,;r. Ackerknecht of Zurich in the foreword to his A Shm't History of Medwtne (196~).. .The most usual reason for studying medical history is the desire to understand me.dlCme It~elf and fr~~p its technics its organization, and Speakmg \"of t e. comPb:~e~ and speciali~ation of present-day medicine, the same author states: .There. 1~ no th way than the study of medical history to brin~ ~0m,? order and coher ence mo. \" e oppressive mass of details ... of modern :nedlCme. The history of most medical specialties has been recorded, at least in part. Legal medicine is an exception. Pioneers of legal medicine in the 18th and early 19th centuries paid special attention th histor of their field and their efforts were crowned by the first volume. of r J ~end.'sYfamous to his. time. In the sdam~ y~~r';~li:~~e;:~~edici~:~ ra h of legal medicine by Ch. medicolegal an earlIer effort by C. F. Daniel (1784). These publications were for many years the sum o~ wor~ in both the his~ory an~ bibliography of legal medicine on a supranational. baSIS. Bl?efer works cont~n~ed. t appear from time to time, but the original enthUSIasm for hIstory faded awa) urmg most of the 19th century. A eneral scepticism of the real importance of history was, howeyer, .not the g , the ne lect. The field of legal medicine was not recogmzed III s?me ~~~t~~~s';,. f~~ indepe!dent specialty. it was usua~IY ~ot reqUlr~~ , in the medical curriculum. This was the case, for .exam~le, 11: erma~y un I ~~~~~eand its position in Great Britain, after a promising start m Edmburgh m 1807, was 10weL\" still. iv )' / \" , ;;;.r. me Even among those working In the field, there was no agreement on its scope. The medicine.\u00b7law field originally consisted of medical reports on cases of questionable death, injuries, pOisoning, determination of pregnancy and its duration, induced abortion, doubtful virginity, and the like, but the increased activity in the field quickly expanded its scope, It soon contained every application of medicine to the needs of the law, and later a similar application of other sciences allied to medicine. Legislation concerned with health' and medicine, as well as decisions of the courts concerning such matteJ:'s as medical practice and ethics, were added, The issue of scope was, however, clouded by ... the inclusion of phrenology, and later of criminal anthropology and criminology. Under the influence of new trends in both medicine and the law, new ideas wel'e included, such as industrial medicine and social medicine (both of which later became independent), The all-embracing term, \"forensic sciences,\" tends at present to cover not only medicine, but any kind of science or technology applied to the needs of justice, All efforts of the past and present to define the scope or even agree upon the name of our subject have been in vain. Plato said, \"He shall be as a god to me, who can rightly divide and define.\" This is partkularly fitting for our discipline. These are the basic reasons why there has been no effol,t t<J compile a comprehensive work on the world history of legal medicine. While there have been shorter publications with wide historical coverage, * they merely kept Mende's heritage alive and brought it up to date, in part. A promise of change came in the early 1960's, with the work of Dr. Robert Peter Brittain of Glasgow. His intention was to write a world history of legal medicine, from its very inception to the present. To achieve this goal, he decided to prepare first a series of national medic:)legal bibliographies listing chiefly monographs. He succeeded in publishing scholarly, and remarkably comprehensive bibliographies of medicolegal works in English (1962), French (1970), and Italian (in press at the time of his death in 1972). Moreover, from 1963 on, he published articles on the history of legal medicine covering the period from antiquity to the 16th century. These articles were apparently destined to form the nuereus of his planned world history. PhysiCian by professlon, specialist in psychiatry, Dr. Brittain was basically a historian and bibliographer of legal medicine. He looked for history in bibliography and for bibliography in history, knowing well their affinity and interdependence. His splendid program required numerous coworkers and it was a project to encompass more than a lifetime. He had almost no help and very little time, yet his accomplishments are of great and enduring value. The, author was in corl'(~spondence with Dr. Brittain from 1968 on and the possi\u00ad bility of collaborative publicaHon was explored. The letter inquiring as to his willingness to serve as coauthor of thi-~ work arrived too late. Thus, this pUblication lacks his expert knowledge of the field\" his bibliographic experience, and many items in his files which are unavailable for indusion. As he stated in the preface to his Bibliogmphy of Medico-Legal W01'ks in English, he collected a mass of materia1 in languages other than English. It is OUr hope that this material will not be lost and will one day serve in continuing Dr. Brittain's great efforts. * Among them, M. Ortolan (1872:), S. E. ChailIEi (1876), O. A.

Definition For the purpose of this work, the terms \"legal medicine,\" \"forensic medicine,\" an\":: \"medical jurisprudence\" (in its broad meaning) are used as equivalents. The most often accepted definition of these terms is \"the application of medicine for the adminis\u00ad tration of justice,\" Even this definition has been challenged as not being broad enough. Because our emphasis is on legal medicine, hqwever, subordinate topics are not mentioned in the title. Scope The subject of the bibliography includes the history of legal medicine and toxicology, forensic psychiatry, forensic dentistry, medical ethies, the legal status of the medical profession, jurisprudence in medicill\\e (malpractice, etc.), quackery, legislation related to th,e foregoing'topics, war crimes of a medical nature, and international medical law. This bibliography makes no claim to being all-inclusive. For a variety of reasons, some subjects include more entries than others. Forensic dentistry, which to A moe do's time (1898) was rarely even mentioned in general medicolegal literature, has a very small Humber of pUblications devoted to its history. On the other hand, from the large body of literature concerning coroner:3 and medical examiners, only the most important items of real historical content have been selected. The researcher can easily find refer\u00ad ences in Dr. Brittain's work or in the indexes published by the National Library of Medicine under these subjects. A few items have been included which appear, from thei.r titles, to be on the history of legal Pledicine, but actually contain almost nothing relevant. This is intended as a time-saving devica for the researcher. With some exceptions, the following have been excluded: biographies, unless they coneern outstanding figures in the field; bibliographies; medicolegal casuistry (except for very early periods or those of great importance) ; criminal trials (unless of unusual importance or involving a number of physicians as defendants) ; regicides or murders of famous persons; the d~ath penalty; apparent death; premature burials; grave body snatching; and criminology. '1'he te?'minu,s ad quem of this bibliography is 1972. vii , L Material and Its Organization This bibliography contains 1,615 entries. It cites monographs, chapters or parts of monographs, journal articles, and dissertations. About 80 percent of these were actually examined. :Entries are in the following languages: Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, Flemish, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, IKor~an, Lat:in, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Rumanian, Russian, Serbian, $lovak, S oveman, Spanish, Swedish, and Turkish. Entries are arranged alphabetically by author or by the title (if anonymous). They aro numbered in sequ~nce ~nd cross-references are furnished for coauthors. The name of thl~ author, as well as the title, is given in the original language. There are a few excep\u00ad tions to that rule, e.g., the title is given in English if it was not located in the original language. The title of the annotated non-English entry is usually not translated, since tbe required information is found in the annotation. Titles in foreign languages which were not available for examination and annotation have been translated into English. Those titles not examined are marked by an asterisk. The material available in the National Library of Medicine was examined and briefly annotated to give the researcher explanatory notes regarding its content. Annota\u00ad tions were omitted in cases of self-explanatory English titles. Entries not examined were entered only if all required bibliographical data for them were known. There are a few exceptions in the case of important monographs for which no pagination was found. Pamphlets which are merely reprints of articles are included for the convenience of the reader, but their origin is always noted. Subject. Index AU important historical features contained in the annotation and/or the title of each entry are recorded in the Subject Index. Each entry in the Suhject Index is followed by numbers referring to the pertinent citation numbers in the bibliography. Comments and corrections are welcome. viii Jaroslav Nemec, Jur.D. .
