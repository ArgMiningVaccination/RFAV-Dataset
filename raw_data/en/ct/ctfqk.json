UT Southwestern Medical Center Ranked among the top academic medical centers in the world, UT Southwestern includes among its faculty four Nobel Prize winners, 40 physicians and researchers elected as presidents of their national specialty associations, and three-fourths of Texas' medical members of the National Academy of Sciences - the most prestigious scientific society in America. It is one of the largest academic physician practices in the Southwest, serving as a major referral center for patients with complex diseases and providing care for nearly 97,000 total inpatient visits and approximately 1.7 million outpatient visits annually. A premier research institution pioneering breakthroughs in cardiovascular disease, cancer, neurosciences and women's health, UT Southwestern offers an unsurpassed pediatric heart disease program in association with Children's that achieved the first successful pediatric heart transplant in Dallas in 1988. Children's Medical Center Dallas Children's is one of the largest and busiest pediatric medical centers in the nation, with 559 beds and nearly 570,000 patient visits annually (inpatient and outpatient). Affiliated with UT Southwestern, Children's is the only academic pediatric medical center in North Texas, and is dedicated exclusively to the comprehensive care of children from birth to age 18. Children's is recognized among the best pediatric hospitals in the country by U.S. News & World Report , ranking in all 10 of the subspecialties covered in the survey, including Top 10 rankings in Orthopedics, Urology and Nephrology. In addition, Children's is a Level I Trauma Center and a Magnet Recognition hospital for nursing excellence. Children's provides care in more than 50 pediatric subspecialties, and is a major pediatric kidney, liver, intestine, heart and bone marrow transplant center. The hospital continues to commit significant resources to expanding services, including the addition of new floors on the main campus in Dallas; a second full-service medical center in Plano, Texas; an outpatient care and surgery center in Southlake, Texas; and the establishment of a network of pediatric primary care offices located throughout the Metroplex. 11Collaborative PartnershipsChildren's Medical Center at Legacy Children's Medical Center at Legacy extends the world-class service of Children's Medical Center to the growing number of families north of Dallas and beyond. The full-service hospital, located in Plano, Texas, includes 72 inpatient beds, six intensive care beds, four state-of-the-art operating rooms, a 24-7 emergency department, diagnostic and pharmacy services and a large outpatient care center. Children's at Legacy offers a full array of pediatric subspecialty services, including cardiology, ENT, sports medicine and maternal fetal medicine. Like Children's in Dallas, the medical staff at Children's at Legacy includes specialists from UT Southwestern, providing a vast base of talent and knowledge. Located at 7 60 1 Preston Road in P lano, T exas, the campus sits on a 1 5 5-acre site with \" green space\" preserved to provide an environment of healing and tranquility for patients and families. Parkland Health & Hospital System Parkland Health & Hospital System was named one of \"America's Best Hospitals\" for 16 consecutive years by U.S. News & World Report . Parkland's legacy of achievements includes the first certified Level I Trauma Center in the region with 62 percent of trauma cases in Dallas County treated at Parkland. Today the hospital offers Centers of Excellence in burns, cancer, cardiology, endocrinology, epilepsy, gastroenterology, orthopedics, spinal cord injuries, trauma, and women and infants. The Parkland Burn Center is the second largest civilian center in the United States and is regarded as among the best. A 90-bed Level III Neonatal Care Unit provides the most skilled health professionals and state-of-the-art tools and equipment for 1,200 severely premature infants and neonates annually. More than 50 percent of the doctors in North Texas have obtained formal training at Parkland. From the poor and homeless to the wealthy, Parkland's main hospital, 11 community health centers, 11 youth and family centers, nine women's clinics and four mobile healthcare vans treat one of the largest and most diverse compositions of patients in the area. Texas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children Texas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children is one of the nation's leading pediatric centers for the treatment of orthopedic conditions, certain related neurological disorders such as spina bifida, and learning disorders such as dyslexia. Serving Texas children from birth to age 18, the hospital has treated more than 200,000 patients since its inception, with 39,625 outpatient visits and 2,146 surgeries performed in fiscal 2010. The medical breakthroughs and new technologies developed through TSRHC's research efforts, including the discovery of the first gene associated with idiopathic scoliosis, dramatically impact the lives of children worldwide. 12EducationEducation One of the three major missions of the Department of Pediatrics is the education of medical students, residents, postdoctoral fellows and other health care professionals by transmitting knowledge, instilling excitement for learning, and translating and refining questions raised during the process. Each division has specific educational goals for the students and residents. Most divisions also have fellowship programs which provide education to prepare fellows for an academic career. Soumya Adhikari, M.D., Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at UT Southwestern Medical Center and Director of the Pediatric Clerkship, completed his residency at UT Southwestern/Children's Medical Center in 2004 and then pursued subspecialty training in pediatric endocrinology through a fellowship at UT Southwestern. Since the completion of his training Dr. Adhikari has split his time between his clinical responsibilities, providing care for children of all ages with hormonal disorders, his research interests, primarily focused on beta cell preservation in type 1 diabetes, and his role as Clerkship Director. Dr. Adhikari earned his Bachelor of Science degree at the University of Florida in Gainesville in 1996 and received his medical degree from the University of Miami School of Medicine in 2001. Jeffrey McKinney, M.D., Ph.D., is Associate Professor of Pediatrics and the Residency Program Director. He has a B.S.E. in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Iowa College of Engineering. He also received a degree in Physiology at Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar, followed by M.D. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Iowa College of Medicine. To seek additional patient and geographic diversity, he was a house officer at Y ale New Haven Children's Hospital, where he stayed as an infectious disease fellow and junior faculty member at Y ale. Between 1998 and 2003 he received all three of Y ale's top service or teaching awards for Pediatric Resident, Fellow and Attending of the Y ear. He was recruited to the Infectious Diseases faculty at Washington University in St. Louis in 2003, where he was elected Pediatric Teacher of the Y ear by residents in 2008 and medical students in 2009. Dr. McKinney has been with UT Southwestern Medical Center since 2009 in his role of program director. He holds the Harry W . Bass, Jr. Professorship in Education. Charles R. Rosenfeld, M.D., Professor of Pediatrics, Obstetrics/Gynecology, and Anesthesiology in the Division of Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine at UT Southwestern, serves as the Director of Fellowship Education and holds the George L. MacGregor P r o f e s s o r s h i p i n P e d i a t r i c s . H i s r e s e a r c h f o c u s i s o n m e c h a n i s m s m o d u l a t i n g uteroplacental and umbilical blood flows, development of the renin-angiotensin system, cardiovascular role of estrogens in pregnancy and fetal-neonatal blood pressure regulation. Dr. Rosenfeld obtained his medical degree from Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, in 1966. Post-doctoral training included Pediatric Residencies at Yale-New Haven Medical Center, New Haven, Connecticut, 1966 - 1967, and Bronx Municipal Hospital Center and Albert Einstein College Medicine, New York, New York, 1967 - 1970, a Pediatric Pulmonary Medicine Fellowship at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, 1970 - 1971 and a Research Fellowship in Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine at the University of Colorado Medical Center, Denver, 1971 - 1973. He joined the UT Southwestern faculty in July 1973. Dr. Rosenfeld has had continuous NIH funding for more than 30 years and has published more than 170 peer-reviewed manuscripts.Jeffrey McKinney, M.D., Ph.D. Associate Professor Director, Pediatric Resident Education Charles R. Rosenfeld, M.D. Professor Director, Pediatric Fellowship Education Soumya Adhikari, M.D. Assistant Professor Director, Pediatric Clerkship 13EducationMedical Student Education As one of four medical schools in the University of Texas system, UT Southwestern accepts approximately 230-240 students annually. The education of these students remains one of the core missions of the Department of Pediatrics. A solid foundation in childhood health and illness has long been recognized as one of the central components of a well-rounded medical education, and the department strives to offer students the opportunity to explore the full breadth of pediatric medical care through their many programs. At the center of these offerings is the core clerkship in Pediatrics for third-year medical students at UT Southwestern. This required element of the medical curriculum consists of an eight-week rotation through the many care units h o u s e d a t C h i l d r e n ' s M e d i c al C e n t e r , i n a d d i t i o n t o s e l e c t l o c a t i o n s a t P a r kl a n d H e al th & H o s p i t al S y s t e m a n d , uniquely, through the offices of select community pediatricians from around the North Texas area who volunteer to participate in student education by hosting medical students in their offices. During this eight-week rotation, students spend four weeks on the inpatient service units at Children's and another four weeks in various ambulatory settings. The inpatient experience is aligned to maximize student participation in all aspects of patient care: students spend two weeks of their time on a general pediatrics ward and two weeks on one of the hospital's subspecialty wards. The outpatient experience provides trainees a one-week exposure to neonatal care at the newborn nursery in Parkland, two weeks of ambulatory experience focused in the Medical Student Clinic, and the aforementioned opportunity to spend a week at the office of a private general pediatrician in the Dallas community. This latter week provides students a unique perspective into the provision of care outside of a traditional academic teaching environment. In the Medical Student Clinic (MSC), third-year students work directly with attending physicians from the faculty o f t h e D e p a r t m e n t o f P e d i a t r i c s a t U T S o u t h w e s t e r n and with local pediatricians who volunteer their time. Knowing that patients who present to MSC will only be seen by them and their attending physician provides students a higher level of responsibility than in many other aspects of their 3rd year training. During these two weeks, students also rotate through many of the subspecialty care clinics located throughout the hospital to gain exposure t o t h e f u l l b r e a d t h o f s p e c i a l i z e d c a r e p r o v i d e d b y s t a ff physicians. A full curriculum based on the core competencies as published by the Council on Medical Student Education in Pediatrics ( COMSEP ) is taught through bedside clinical supervision, daily rounds, in addition to various didactic sessions and interactive case-based discussions facilitated by faculty in nearly all the divisions in the Department of Pediatrics. The entire curriculum is reviewed on an ongoing basis based on feedback from medical school faculty, national regulatory agencies and students themselves. Newly this year, a web site dedicated to the student clerkship was created to give the students one place to turn for all their educational resources. Students rotating through the core clerkship continue to outpace national averages on standardized assessments. For the 2009-2010 academic year, UT Southwestern students scored three points above the national average for comparable pediatric clerkships on the National Board of Medical Examiners subject exam in Pediatrics. Fourth- year medical studen ts at UT South western have more flexibility to tailor their academic schedule to meet individual learning goals. Whether students want to gain a more in-depth exposure to pediatric subspecialties in preparation for an eventual career in pediatrics or just to strengthen their foundation in caring for children in advance of another career path, the department offers numerous opportunities to fourth-year students through the facilities at Children's and Parkland. Students can immerse themselves in acute/intensive care experiences via rotations in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit and Pediatric Emergency Medicine. Extended experiences in any of the various subspecialty clinics including Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Nephrology, Gastroenterology, Endocrinology and others are available for fourth-year students as well. In addition, in the past 14Educationyear, a total of 39 students from outside institutions came to UT Southwestern and Children's Medical Center to do visiting rotations in Pediatrics. The department also offers, and continues to strive to increase the number of, international-health elective opportunities for students. Medical students rated their experience on their Pediatrics Clerkship in 2009-2010 as overwhelmingly positive. Student feedback from course evaluations has remained consistently positive, specifically as it relates to autonomy, promotion of clinical skills, and preparation for internship. On the 2010 graduation questionnaire, 91.5% of UT Southwestern students rated their educational experience as \"good\" or \"excellent,\" continuing a trend of excellence in that measure for the past 5 years. Faculty from the Department of Pediatrics also participate, often in leadership roles, in the more didactic curriculum of the first two years of medical school, including such key courses as genetics, biochemistry and medical ethics. Beginning with the 2007-2008 academic year, faculty members in the department also served as mentors in the new colleges system at UT Southwestern. Each mentored a group of six medical students in both first- and second-year classes and delivered curricula such as professionalism and ethics, communication skills like taking patients' histories, diagnostic and physical exam skills, and clinical reasoning and interpretation skills through weekly small group meetings. The first group of students to participate in the colleges program will graduate this year. The department takes great pride in the quality of teaching provided by the entire faculty. At the 2010 Excellence in Education Annual Reception and Award ceremony, four faculty members in the department received teaching awards. These included one faculty member recognized for excellence for their role in the MS1 Preclinical curriculum (James Amatruda), an MS2 Preclinical Teaching Award (Angela Mihalic), and two Pediatrics Core Clerkship Teaching Awards (Christina Bourland and Paul Harker-Murray). Perhaps most telling, 26 students from the graduating medical school class of 2010 have chosen to pursue a career in pediatrics or some combined program including pediatrics. 15EducationResident Education The UT Southwestern Pediatric Residency Program at Children's Medical Center partners with the Department of Pediatrics faculty members to provide broad and deep educational experiences to our 100 UT Southwestern - Children's Medical Center pediatric house officers, as well as more than 200 visiting trainees in anesthesia, emergency medicine, family medicine and psychiatry. Each division in the Pediatrics Department contributes substantially to the Residency Program in important ways, including educating residents during each rotation, and through noon conference didactic presentations. Select faculty also serve as academic mentors for resident-prepared large group lectures in the context of our evidence based medicine series, the mortality and morbidity series, and the weekly department-wide featured case of the week teaching conference; as well as small group, literature-based, morning reports that develop critical thinking skills. Residents go through 13 four-week rotations throughout the academic year. The rotations offer the residents their core education in pediatric medicine as practiced in the emergency room, pediatric ward medicine teams, newborn nursery, neonatal and pediatric intensive care units, and subspeciality ward service teams. Additional training i n s u b s p e c i a l t y c o n s u l t s e r v i c e s a n d o t h e r i n d i v i d u a l i z e d t r a i n i n g a r e o ff e r e d a s e l e c t i v e s . L e a r n i n g c l i n i c - b a s e d pediatrics with continuity of care and longitudinal follow up occurs throughout training. The program is evaluated twice yearly by multiple stakeholders. These evaluators include our cadre of longitudinal mentors, program leaders, educational leaders within the inpatient and ambulatory areas, and current and future chief residents. Evaluations include resident assessment of rotations and faculty, in-training examination scores, certifying examination scores, duty hours and other ACGME compliance issues, and an in-depth review of educational experiences by all divisions. All divisions meet to discuss resident feedback provided through resident evaluation of rotations. Pediatric Residency Program Team The program is led by Jeffrey McKinney, M.D., Ph.D., Program Director, who works closely and collaboratively with the program's two Associate Program Directors, Dorothy Sendelbach, M.D. and Lauren Gore, M.D., and the Program Coordinator, Dawn Bay\u00e9, MBA. They offer unique and complimentary talents and insights that strengthen the program and the education of its residents. Dorothy Sendelbach, M.D. , Associate Professor of Pediatrics and Associate Program Director, received her undergraduate degree in chemical engineering from Rutgers University. She graduated from New Jersey Medical School in Newark. She completed her residency at Children's Medical Center in 1985. She briefly worked in a pediatric emergency room, followed by seven years as a primary care pediatrician in an inner city clinic for the indigent and working poor. For the past 15 years, Dr. Sendelbach has worked in the Department of Pediatrics at UT Southwestern. Her clinical practice is as an attending pediatrician in the newborn nursery at Parkland Memorial Hospital where there are about 15,000 admissions annually and where she 2010-2011 Residents 16Educationserves as Medical Director. Her interests include breastfeeding promotion, jaundice screening, neonatal abstinence syndrome and pulse oximetry screening. Since 2006, Dr. Sendelbach has served as an Associate Program Director for the Pediatric Residency Program and is the primary leader of the mentorship program, for internal program reviews, and for new electives creation and development. She is part of UT Southwestern's medical student mentoring program, and was honored as the 2009 Physician of the Year among all Parkland physicians. Lauren Gore, M.D. , Assistant Professor of Pediatrics and Associate Program Director, received her undergraduate degree from Texas A&M University. She graduated from UT Health Science Center, where she received her M.D. Dr. Gore completed her residency at UT Southwestern in 2007. She also served as Chief Resident during 2007-2008, which sparked her interest in resident education. Mentoring is one of her true passions, and Dr. Gore serves as a mentor to the PL3 residents and guides the chief residents through their year. She has participated in recruitment of the new intern class, program development, continuity clinic logistics, and mentoring residents during CAT, M&M, and advocacy projects. Her in-depth and nuanced understanding of patient flow and care systems, honed as a former UT Southwestern - Children's Medical Center Chief Resident have profoundly improved integration of this year's ACGME patient safety mandates into the system. The 2010-2011 Chief Residents were Mindy Calandro, Diana Dickschat and David Troendle . The chiefs are heavily involved in the day-to-day activities of the program and serve as a liaison among faculty members and residents. Chief resident focused project development efforts have led to substantial department-wide process improvements in house officer training, patient safety, and the front line use of medical literature and evidence based medicine. Pediatric Residency Program Enhancements Dr. McKinney, in his second year as Program Director, saw a reduction in resident work hours, mandated by the ACGME. Changes in resident schedules were lead by the chief residents (detailed in Chief Projects section). The mandated reduction in duty hours will also impact how residents learn, and develop their professional skills. 2010 saw several updates to the program. Feature examples are: Resident Talent Development - Interest Groups The residency program continues to see the importance of medical interest group development for the residents. To guide these interests, two new interest groups were developed, make a total of three groups: t\u0001Innovations in BioMedicine (NEW) - serves as a research interest group. The residents meet regularly to discuss research articles with invited faculty members and fellows as presenters. t\u0001Advocacy and Transnational Medicine Group (NEW) - topics discussed in this group include Community Needs Assessments, Policy Maker Interactions, Local Resource Partnerships and Advocacy Project Sustainability. The Advocacy and Transnational Medicine Group is lead by Nancy Kelly, M.D., and Christina Bourland, M.D. t\u0001Primary Care Pediatrics - the group serves an avenue for residents interested in primary care pediatrics to learn about the field from leading primary care and public health physicians. Incorporation of iPod Touches In 2010, the residency program created a shift in how medical information is delivered to house officers, through the use of a dedicated medical education computer server network, and each house officer's iPod Touch. The iPod Touch allows residents to access key teaching videos, continuity clinic curriculum, archived resources and our state-of-the-art medical library in a timely, efficient manner. Delivering key information to residents with a swipe of the finger continues to improve patient care and safety. 17EducationMedical-Legal Partnership The Medical-Legal Partnership aims to improve the health and well-being of vulnerable individuals, children and families by integrating legal services into the medical setting. The residents have now been successfully trained to identify those patients and families in need of legal services. The residents screen and identify social determinants that affect patients, reporting the concerns to the lawyers housed in Children's Medical Center. The services allow for the residents to be more complete and effective, advocates for their patients. Dr. McKinney also focused on the following initiatives throughout the year:t\u0001Intern Medical Literature Search and Clinical Citation Training Sessions t\u0001Senior Resident Mortality and Morbidity Root Cause Analysis Conference Series t\u0001Department Case of the Week Conference, to include real-time inter-service faculty discussions of key decision branch points in patient evaluation and treatments t\u0001Medical Spanish Language Skills - Incorporation of Rosetta Stone within the program t\u0001Community Advocacy Training t\u0001Novel Recruiting Strategies and Tactics to Attract UT Southwestern / Children's Medical Center House Officer Candidates To Dallas Chief Resident Projects Beyond their essential day-to-day roles as teachers, role models, and leaders, the chief residents have been central to achieving specific program enhancements. The 2010 chiefs have incorporated the following into the Program: Behavioral / Developmental Rotation Changes The developmental pediatrics rotation, which takes place during the second year of residency, has undergone a number of changes this year. Many of these changes evolved from resident suggestions and requests for experiences they wanted to gain during this rotation. Rather than spending most of the block at Texas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children, the residents now spend time in a variety of clinics and schools in the Dallas metroplex. Residents spend time in a number of CMC clinics including low birth weight observing Bayley's developmental exams, international adoption and foster care clinic understanding the unique developmental issues this unique patient population presents, and the neurodevelopmental disabilities clinic. The chiefs have designed a number of learning opportunities away from the hospital as well. Residents spend time at the Callier Center for communication disorders where they participate in various autism therapy groups, as well as learn about feeding difficulties in the pediatric population. The residents also spend time at the Crystal Charity Ball Autism clinic where they observe the entire intake and evaluation process of a child with concern for autism. Several clinic sessions are also spent with a private pediatrician in the Dallas area who specializes in the diagnosis and management of ADHD. The residents also have had the opportunity to spend time at the Shelton School for children with learning differences seeing a wide array of classroom environments, speech evaluations, and various therapy sessions. Intern Retreat The intern retreat has always been an opportunity for professional development as well as time for reflection on the events that have transpired throughout the year. As in prior years, time at the retreat was spent working on team building, as well as discussion about process improvement. In light of suggestions from prior residents, it was also decided to focus on one of the more difficult issues in pediatrics which has to do with death and the dying process among our patients. David Browning, who is a medical social worker from Boston Children's Hospital, facilitated an in-depth session with the interns regarding how medical professionals deal not only with terminal patients but also with these patient's families. The retreat also focused a great deal of time on how to begin designing and implementing a class wide advocacy project with the goal of making this project a \"three year effort\" rather than beginning a project late in the third year. 18EducationSchedule Changes A significant amount of time this year was spent redesigning the residency program structure in light of the new ACGME duty hours regulations. Given that the new regulations allow for no more than 16 hours of call in a row for PL1s and no greater than 24 hours of call for PL 2/3s, there were a number of changes that needed to be implemented for the residency program. In order to begin the process of redesigning the schedule for the residency program, the program leadership made a list of important goals for this restructuring which included, but were not limited to, enhancing the educational value of residency, limiting the number of patient handoffs, and preserving exposure to a vast array of pediatric clinical diagnoses. Educational Library Last year, the residency program began working on a project that would deliver high quality educational materials to residents on demand. This year a delivery system was developed that allows residents to access a library of sentinel literature and training videos whether it be on their home computer, any computer on campus, or on their iPod Touch at the patient's bedside. The library continues to grow. It contains historic original descriptions of classic diseases from physicians such as Addison, Kawasaki and Stills, training videos of commonly preformed procedures, as well as contemporary articles to help with point of care decision making. This library teaches residents an appreciation of the literature and allows them to practice evidence based medicine more effectively and efficiently on the front lines. Ethics Curriculum This past year, a new objective oriented ethics curriculum was successfully developed and piloted. The curriculum utilizes frequently meeting small groups, longitudinal mentorship, and case based learning sessions to equip residents with tools necessary to identify, analyze, and resolve ethical issues in clinical medicine. The program looks forward to utilizing this curriculum for years to come to aid in our mission of training compassionate, principle based, ethical physicians of the future. Mentor Program A central element of the Pediatric Residency Program is its longitudinal mentorship actively provided to every resident. The mentor program was established in 2004 to increase the individualized approach to resident development and pursuit of educational goals. A mentor is assigned to a resident during intern orientation, and that resident/mentor dyad continues throughout the three years of residency training. The mentor relationship allows residents the one-on-one interaction with a faculty member that guides them through residency, career development, evaluation review, and guidance through individual residents' projects. The mentor is not necessarily intended to be an expert specialist in the particular field of subspecialty training that a resident may choose to pursue. Rather, the mentor's focus is to provide oversight, general counsel and guidance pertinent to the individual in the process of developing as a well rounded pediatrician. The mentors are well positioned within the department to have broad connections to all subspecialty areas so that if a resident is interested in pursuing a particular path with some specificity, such as a research block, that mentor is of assistance in arranging such interactions. In 2010, 15 faculty members served as mentors: This group meets monthly with the Department Chair and the Program Director to review each intern or resident's progress and career development.Soumya Adhikari, M.D. Christina Bourland, M.D. Laura Brumley, M.D. Matthew Cox, M.D. Maite de la Morena, M.D.Becky Ennis, M.D. Lauren Gore, M.D. Nancy Kelly, M.D., Pamela Okada, M.D. Raymong Quigley, M.D.Dorothy Sendelbach, M.D. Maeve Sheehan, M.D. Joel Steinberg, M.D. Jennifer Walsh, M.D. Myra Wyckoff, M.D. 19EducationAdvocacy Curriculum Advocacy has advanced to more than just residents completing an advocacy project, but now to an advocacy curriculum. Under the direction of Drs. Nancy Kelly and Christina Bourland the advocacy curriculum includes: t\u0001Noon Conferences t\u0001Web Based Learning t\u0001Advocacy Interest Group t\u0001Work with Resident Advocacy Leaders t\u0001Advocacy Newsletter t\u0001Year Specific Activities Intern Year Diary of patient issues that affect them Intern retreat session First Care activities (Medical Legal Program) Second Year Selection advocacy project Adolescent activity Third Year Community pediatrics rotation Implementation / completion of advocacy project The Senior Residents completed advocacy projects that addressed many needs in the community. Many projects allowed for improvements in the hospital, community and culturally. Samples of the 2010-2011 advocacy projects are: t\u0001Texas Cord Blood Banking t\u0001Resource guide for practitioners, patients, and families in the Dallas Community dealing with Obesity and Asthma t\u0001Resident education on talking to parents about a new diagnosis of Down Syndrome t\u0001Child Abuse Prevention project through parent education in high risk populations (specifically working with teen moms with limited education and support) t\u0001Palliative Care t\u0001Substance Abuse - marijuana and its complications t\u0001Shadowing and education experience with high school youth and hospital volunteers t\u0001STAND - Smart Teens Against Nicotine and Drugs Intern Recruitment Intern recruitment saw a 15% increase in applicants interviewed, with 34 new interns positions offered for the 2011- 2012 academic year. The new intern class brings a wide range of diversity, language skills, advocacy talents and research experience. Core interviewers increased their responsibilities during the recruitment season, not only interviewing candidates, but also providing an extensive analysis of a candidate's application. Our faculty graciously invested more than 1,000 hours in interviews alone. The core interviewers were: Kathryn Ban, M.D. Bradley Barth, M.D. Christina Bourland, M.D. Carolyn Cannon, M.D., Ph.D. Leticia Castillo, M.D. Lina Chalak, M.D. Mark Clay, M.D. Jennifer Cox, M.D. Matthew Cox, M.D. Cindy Darnell, M.D., M.S.C.S.

Using a transgenic mouse model we are able to selectively kill actively dividing neural crest cells, thus allowing disruption of outflow tract formation during a well-defined temporal period. The team is hoping to define a critical period of neural crest cell division which, if disrupted, will produce a phenotype similar to persistent truncus arteriosus.

Studying hepatobiliary transport and hepatocyte cell volume regulation in the lab of Dr. Andrew Feranchak, studies demonstrated 1) that hepatocyte cell volume regulation is dependent on ATP release and purinergic signaling, 2) that fatty liver cells have altered cell volume regulatory mechanisms stemming from a decrease in secretion of ATP, and 3) that this altered cell volume regulation can be overcome with the addition of extracellular ATP.

Sports Medicine Study Guide and Review for Boards. Certifcations Heather Miller t\u0001Helping Babies Breath Certification as Instructor. 2011 2010 Graduating Residents 22EducationFellow Education In January 2005, the department established an interdisciplinary program for subspecialty education. The objective, a work in progress, is to develop a departmental repository of educational and administrative resources and experiences to enrich the opportunities offered by the individual subspecialty training programs. The program is directed by Dr. Rosenfeld, who has more than 35 years experience in postgraduate education and research, in conjunction with the Program Directors, other faculty and, very importantly, the fellows. Central to the program's activities is a bimonthly conference designed to explore and discuss institutional resources, examine approaches and requirements needed to initiate clinical and laboratory research, plan a career and make career choices, present ongoing research by faculty and fellows, and provide a site for social interaction and discussions between trainees from all subspecialties. The program is unique in that much of the ACGME required core curriculum can be achieved in a manner that best meets the needs of each trainee. During 2010 there were 97 subspecialty trainees within the various divisions. Tremendous value is placed on preparing these young pediatricians to undertake careers as clinician-investigators, teachers, subspecialty consultants and, more generally, as contributors to the growing body of knowledge in pediatric medicine and developmental biology. Fellowship education is viewed as the first and most important step in the transfer of the academic mission to the next generation. The last decade has been associated with a substantial change in postgraduate education, prompted by the recognition that the \"old\" apprenticeship system often shortchanged the education of the trainee in the interest of providing clinical service. This has resulted in guidelines that guarantee the integrity of the educational environment against the demands that the changing healthcare landscape has been applying on academic centers. Although the spirit of these guidelines has been welcomed by the academic community, the balance between clinical responsibility and education remains an issue that is in flux. The department, therefore, sees opportunity in this changing educational environment. Key to realizing this opportunity is acknowledging that subspecialty training must accomplish three goals: 1. Prepare future subspecialists cognitively and technically to practice their discipline proficiently using an evidence- based approach 2. Provide analytical skills and critical thinking necessary to confront conditions they may not have previously encountered 3. Engender a desire to advance knowledge and improve care through research and teaching To facilitate the pursuit of these goals, each division has a training program that provides the clinical experience and research environment for trainees to be exposed to scientific investigation and be taught the means to translate inquiry into scholarship. All subspecialty programs were reaccredited by the Residency Review Committee of the ACGME in 2008 and contain clinical and research experiences in accordance with the guidelines set forth by the American Board of Pediatrics. In compliance with these guidelines, each trainee has a Scholarship Oversight Committee that assists the Program Directors in monitoring each trainee's research experiences. The Department of Pediatrics encourages its subspecialty fellows to participate in national and local activities that will enhance their education. UT Southwestern's fellows have been recognized for their accomplishments and academic potential by receiving awards and grants from many sources. Several fellows also have competed successfully for fellowships from the Pediatric Scientist 2010 Graduating Fellows 23EducationTraining Program and K-awards from the NIH or analogous mentored research grants. The Department and Medical School are committed to encouraging and assisting talented physicians to develop an academic career; to this end, UT Southwestern has created a Physician-Scientist Training Program and a Curriculum in Patient-Oriented Research to help launch the careers of promising trainees. Twenty-six of the 97 fellowship trainees Department completed their training in June 2010. Fifteen of the 26 assumed academic positions in various medical schools, with 53% remaining on the faculty at UT Southwestern. Notably, three trainees chose to do additional training/research, while the remaining trainees entered into clinical practice. Of the graduating fellows, 35% received peer-reviewed funding for their fellowship research project (e.g., the American Academy of Pediatrics) and eighteen published peer-reviewed manuscripts prior to completing their training. This group also presented 51 abstracts at regional, national or international meetings during their senior year. Th e f u t u r e o f p e d i a t r i c s u b s p e c i a l t y t r a i n i n g c o n t i n u e s t o c h a n g e at UT Southwestern. Separate conferences have been established to meet the individual needs of the 1st year and the 2nd-3rd year trainees in August and September. A notable change in our Training Programs was the establishment of a Senior Fellows' Research Day on May 25, 2010. There were 18 poster presentations and five oral presentations, the latter chosen after abstract reviews by the faculty. This was followed by a dinner for all trainees, mentors, program directors and division directors and a presentation by Dr. Alan Schwartz, Chairman of Pediatrics, Washington University School of Medicine, on identifying opportunities for career development. Awards were given for the best poster and oral presentations. Second year trainees presented their research in the second half of the core curriculum in order to receive timely critical review from their peers and the faculty at an early stage in their research efforts.

Originating in the Department of Internal Medicine, it now spans both departments, with four Pediatric-based and two Internal Medicine-based faculty members, each board certified in Allergy and Immunology. Pediatric allergist specialists, Drs. Indulekha Warrier, J. Andrew Bird and William Neaville see children with allergic disorders and asthma at Children's, staffing eleven allergy clinics per week. In addition, Dr. Maite de la Morena has established a primary immunodeficiency program at Children's. She sees all inpatient consultations for immunodeficiency disorders and has three clinics per week during which she evaluates these patients. Dr. David Khan is the Program Director of the Allergy and Immunology fellowship program. Both he and Dr. Rebecca Gruchalla, Division Director, see adults and children with asthma and allergic disorders at the Aston Center at UT Southwestern. The division continues to participate in both clinical and basic science research efforts. As both a clinical and a mechanistic site in the Inner City Asthma Consortium (ICAC), it continues to expand its research efforts in pediatric asthma. The division also collaborates with various basic scientists on campus: Drs. Michelle Gill, Nitin Karandikar and David Farrar. In addition to asthma research, the Clinical Immunology Program at UT Southwestern, directed by Dr. de la Morena, was awarded recognition by the Jeffrey Modell Foundation as a Center of Excellence for diagnosis and treatment of primary immunodeficiency diseases. The Immunology Program serves a large geographic referral area encompassing North Texas, eastern New Mexico, Oklahoma, western Louisiana and southern Arkansas. This comprehensive program provides both diagnostic and state-of-the-art treatment opportunities for patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases. Furthermore, the Immunology Program is committed to the education of physicians and other healthcare providers, trainees, the general public, patients and families regarding diagnosis, manifestation, natural history and treatment of primary immunodeficiency diseases. Faculty Rebecca Gruchalla, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, is the Division Chief of Allergy and Immunology at UT Southwestern and holder of the William A. Sellars, M.D. and Joyce M. Sellars Distinguished Chair in Allergy and Immunology.

UT Southwestern Medical Center was among 11 institutions selected by the National Institutes of Health to receive $56 million over five years as part of the Inner City Asthma Consortium (ICAC). The ICAC investigates novel treatments and causes of asthma in urban children. Ongoing studies include a prospective, longitudinal evaluation of environmental factors that influence the development of asthma. The consortium is administered by the University of Wisconsin-Madison. In addition to UT Southwestern, research is being conducted at Boston University, Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago, Children's National Medical Center in Washington, D.C., Henry Ford Health System, in Detroit, National Jewish Health in Denver, Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, St. Louis Children's Hospital and University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Drew Bird enrolled five subjects in a study using peanut oral immunotherapy (OIT). OIT is an experimental treatment for food allergy that involves safely ingesting small amounts of the food to which the person is allergic and increasing the amount on a regular basis. He is working with Dr. Michelle Gill, Assistant Professor, Pediatric Infectious Disease and Internal Medicine, to understand the immunologic changes that accompany the development of desensitization to peanuts during peanut OIT. Other studies performed in 2010 included two multi-center trials examining the safety of giving the flu vaccine to a child with egg allergy, and understanding the effects of a cooking class on the quality of life for families dealing with food allergies. Clinical Activities Asthma and Allergy The Asthma and Allergy outpatient clinic is equipped to diagnose and manage the whole spectrum of allergic diseases. There are nine half day clinics per week to provide care for patients. An average of 200 patients are seen per month for evaluation and management of various atopic diseases, including, but not limited to, asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, food allergy, insect sting allergy and drug allergy. Procedures such as skin prick testing for environmental and food allergens, hymenoptera venom allergy testing and testing for drug allergies are performed by trained personnel. Other services offered are immunotherapy - both traditional and rush - and anti-IgE immunoglobulin administration. A Pulmonary Function Lab is available for spirometry as well as exhaled nitric oxide studies for the evaluation and management of patients with asthma. Providers work closely with educators from the Asthma Education and Asthma Management programs to provide a comprehensive management strategy for patients with severe asthma. Special procedures such as drug challenges and food challenges are also performed in the outpatient clinic. A combined Allergy/Immunology and Otolaryngology sinus clinic (CASCADE) was established recently to provide comprehensive care for patients with chronic sinusitis. One half-day clinic per month is offered at either the Dallas or Legacy campus. To facilitate care, patients who are seen in these clinics have a complete evaluation of allergen sensitization patterns and immunological system, as well as an otolaryngological evauluation in one setting. An active inpatient consult service is available for evaluation of patients with allergic diseases. Consults are usually requested in cases of suspected drug-allergy, anaphylactic reactions and severe asthma. 28Allergy & ImmunologyFood Allergy In September of 2010, the Food Allergy Center at Children's Medical Center, which is directed by Dr. Drew Bird, officially opened its doors. This multidisciplinary center, in association with UT Southwestern, is the only academically affiliated pediatric food allergy program in North Texas. As such, the Center provides comprehensive care for patients who have been diagnosed with food allergies and conducts research that is instrumental in developing treatments, therapies and, ultimately, a cure for food allergies. Its staff also works tirelessly throughout the region to educate parents, healthcare providers, school personnel and community stakeholders to help children and families navigate the many challenges associated with this complex health issue. The grand opening of the Children's Medical Center Food Allergy Center set a high standard of excellence for the future of the Food Allergy Program. The new Center was made possible with the support of the Robert H. Dedman, Jr. Family Foundation, The Robert and Nancy Dedman Foundation and Mrs. Robert H. Dedman, Sr. Their $2.35 million gift supported construction costs and additional infrastructure needs. The event attracted nationally recognized leaders in the food allergy field such as Dr. Hugh Sampson from the Jaffe Food Allergy Institute at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City. The Food Allergy Collaborative is a partnership between Children's Medical Center and Food Allergy Institute (FAI). The collaborative will be an annual event to host key leaders in food allergy research and advocacy. During the Center's first year, Dr. Bird completed more than 950 clinical visits. In addition, more than 35 food challenges were conducted in 2010. Food challenges are performed when laboratory and skin testing have left uncertainty as to whether a child is allergic to a particular food. Small amounts of the potentially allergenic food are given in incremental doses over an hour and the child is observed for two additional hours. If the child has an allergic reaction, the food is removed from the diet. If the child is able to tolerate a full serving without a reaction, the food is reintroduced into the child's diet. Immunology Directed by Dr. de la Morena, the Immunology outpatient clinic at Children's serves as a referral center for primary immunodeficiency diseases for North Texas, southern Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana and New Mexico. Patients with recurrent, persistent or unusual infections are evaluated for an inherited disorder of immune function. The clinic has expertise for management of all established primary immunodeficiency disorders (>155 disorders currently recognized). Referrals for periodic fever syndromes and evaluations for immunosuppressed states post transplantations also are seen in clinics. Assisted by clinic personnel Holly Grannon and Elizabeth Tschoepe, more than 500 patients have been seen in the outpatient clinics. The Immunology program currently follows more than 150 established primary immunodeficiency diseases. More than 25 patients receive infusions of gammaglobulin regularly. Inpatient consultation services for evaluation of immunodeficiency are available seven days a week. More than 100 inpatient consults were provided last year. In collaboration with Drs. Victor Aquino and Jennifer Cox of the Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) team at Children's, 11 patients have received hematopoetic cell transplantation for primary immunodeficiency diseases. All are doing well. 1 Interferon-gamma defect 1 Chediak Higashi syndrome ImmunologyPresentations/Teaching Activities The Allergy and Immunology division provides the major instruction to pediatric residents in the evaluation and management of children with allergic diseases, asthma and immunodeficiency diseases. It also provides didactic teaching for the pediatric residents on the basics of allergy and immunology and directs teaching for the pediatric residents in the regular departmental clinical conferences and as part of the inpatient consultation service. An Allergy and Immunology elective is available for pediatric residents, and fourth-year medical students. The objectives of the elective are to: t\u0001Develop a working differential diagnosis of allergies, asthma and primary immunodeficiencies; t\u0001Learn how to conduct a complete physical exam including the upper and lower airways; t\u0001Examine and discuss patients from all major allergy and immunology categories: allergic rhinitis, asthma, urticaria, drug allergy, food allergy and primary immunodeficiency. Pediatric residents see outpatients in our clinics under the supervision of one of the members of the division faculty. Relevant articles about specific allergic and immunologic disorders are provided to residents at the beginning of each rotation and residents attend clinical conferences offering didactic teaching for fellows. In addition to resident training, the division has one of only 71 accredited programs for fellowship training in Allergy and Immunology; Dr. David Khan is the Program Director.

Research is strongly supported by UT Southwestern's main campus resources, including extensive core facilities for genetic evaluation and both surgical and catheterization suites for large animal studies. Clinical research is further augmented by the Department of Clinical Sciences, with support services for study design, grant preparation and statistical analysis. The clinical service program benefits from a large referral base, including those from regional, national and international sources in addition to the local Metroplex population. In collaboration with Children's Medical Center, construction of a new Heart Center is under way to bring all cardiac services together on one floor of the hospital, beginning with a new 20-bed CVICU that opened last year. The division actively participates in the training of students, residents and subspecialty fellows, which is provided by a diverse and talented cardiology faculty, who themselves represent all of the major training programs in the United States.

Basic Science An exciting new area of investigation is the development of biodegradable stents for use in the cardiovascular system. Current research is directed at an evaluation of the tissue response to these materials in animals. Cardiopulmonary bypass is known to have adverse effects on neurologic de velopment, but a clear understanding of the mechanisms is lacking. Using a mouse model of bypass, investigation is underway to evaluate biomarkers of injury. Another new area of investigation is to optimize cardiovascular support therapy for pediatric patients with end stage heart failure. Currently the only ventricular assist devices available require surgical placement. We are investigating an animal model for the feasibility of a catheter delivered device. One additional animal research area is the optimization of technologies for fetal intervention. Clinical Sciences The cardiology division participates in multiple multicenter trials. In interventional catheterization, current trials are assessing various devices, including the Amplatzer and Helex occluders, and management of coarctation including the placement of stents. It is anticipated that a recently completed multicenter trial of athletic screening processes will be used for a broader national evaluation. We are contributing to a quality initiative to assess the care of patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. A multicenter effort is also underway to evaluate the use of ventricular assist devices in the pediatric population. Collaborative studies within the department of Pediatrics include protocols to evaluate stroke, migraine, and complications of sickle cell disease and childhood cancer. Ongoing areas of research interest include epidemiologic studies of congenital heart disease, particularly within the state of Texas, natural history studies of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm neonates, MRI evaluation of pulmonary hypertension and for postoperative tetralogy of Fallot, evaluation of renal function with heart catheterization, markers for cardiac transplant rejection, and innovations in noninvasive cardiac monitoring. Clinical Activities Pediatric Cardiology faculty provided more than 8,000 inpatient, outpatient and diagnostic services in 2010. Inpatients with cardiac disease received care in the 20-bed CVICU and a 22-bed telemetry/step-down unit. Last year, care was provided for 500 surgical patients, including 359 open cases, 16 cardiac transplants and 2,395 medical patients with an average length of stay of 12 days in the CVICU and six days on the cardiology inpatient unit. Nearly 9,900 patients were evaluated in the outpatient clinics at Children's main campus and Legacy facilities. In addition to overall cardiac evaluation, specialty clinics provided focused care for patients with implanted devices, arrhythmia, obesity, cholesterol and lipid disorders, heart transplantation, Marfan syndrome and adults with congenital heart disease. Diagnostic services included 878 cardiac catheterizations, most involving interventional procedures. Eighty-three of those were electrophysiologic procedures including catheter ablation. Noninvasive studies are comprised of imaging and electrocardiographic studies. The division performed 7,141 transthoracic ECHOs, 628 transesophageal studies and 400 studies included 11,802 electrocardiograms (ECGs), 852 Holter monitors, 226 pacemaker analyses, 142 exercise tests and 133 cardiac MRIs. Additionally, telemedicine capabilities for transmission and review of echocardiographic and electrocardiographic studies are available to multiple institutions across the state, from Amarillo to Tyler. Approximately 549 ECHOs and 100 ECGs were interpreted from these institutions. 39CardiologyPresentations/Teaching Activities \"MJFTTB\u00011\u000f\u0001#BSOFT \u0001.\u000f%\u000f t\u0001\"Feasibility

Medicine plays a vital role in providing care to critically ill children at Children's and is continuously making improvements and innovations to ensure the patient care provided is of the highest quality. It has a long-standing history of clinical, bench and translational research. The division's internationally recognized critical care fellowship program, one of the largest and most competitive programs, attracts top pediatric graduates. Teaching of fellows, residents and medical students takes place at the bedside and during lectures and simulation sessions. In addition, there is an array of research training opportunities helping fellows learn to ask and answer scientific questions relating to the genetic, molecular, cellular, physiologic and nutritional and metabolic aspects of pediatric critical care medicine. In 2010 the Critical Care Division extended to the Legacy campus, where Dr. Raymond Nkwantabisa serves as Clinical Director. This six-bed unit at Children's Medical Center at Legacy serving the north Dallas pediatric community is the only pediatric intensive care unit in the area. The cardiovascular intensive care unit, a tertiary level facility with complex congenital heart disease, expanded its faculty to seven attendings and continues to grow. Recruitment of additional faculty continues in an effort to meet the growing demands of patients and referring physicians in the area. Faculty Leticia Castillo, M.D., Professor, Thomas Fariss Marsh, Jr. Chair in Pediatrics and Director of the Division of Pedicatric Critical Care Medicine began her medical career at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, where she received her M.D. Following her internship and residency in pediatrics in Mexico City, she served as an intern and resident at the New England Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts. She then completed a fellowship in Pediatric Critical Care Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital and a postdoctoral fellowship in Nutrition Biochemistry at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Dr. Castillo served on the faculty at Harvard Medical School as a scientist at the laboratory of Human Nutrition, Massachustetts Institute of Technology. In 2005 she served on the faculty at Baylor College of Medicine and as a senior investigator at the Children's Nutrition Research Center, USDA. She has served as a permanent member at the Surgery, Anesthesia and Trauma Scientific Review Group at the National Institutes of Health and on the Advisory Board for the National Center for Rehabilitation Research at the Eunice Shriver National Institute of Child Health Development of the NIH.

Faculty members are engaged in bench, translational and clinical research projects. There are multiple areas of investigation that the division is proud to highlight. The long term goals of Dr. Leticia Castillo's laboratory are focused on defining the regulatory mechanisms of nutrient homeostasis under conditions of inflammation and critical illness, and how these processes affect nutrient requirements for nutritional balance and function maintenance. Attention is focused on translational studies on:t\u0001A m i n o a c i d h o m e o s t a s i s a n d u t i l i z a t i o n d u r i n g e n t e r a l o r p a r e n t e r a l r o u t e s o f a d m i n i s t r a t i o n p r o v i d e d t o critically ill children. t\u0001Parenteral and enteral sulfur amino acid requirements to maintain methylation function and glutathione synthesis rates. t\u0001Protein and energy interactions under conditions of inflammation and insulin resistance. t\u0001The impact of current critical care practices providing continuous light and feedings on circadian clock mechanisms and insulin resistance in critically ill children. For this purpose, we use stable isotopic mass spectrometric and imagining techniques. The over-arching theme of Dr. Deborah Carlson's work is to characterize the inflammasome mediating the inflammatory response in the heart following thermal injury and thermal injury complicated with sepsis. She is currently examining the mechanism of caspase-1 activation, identifying the inflammasome and its components within the heart and within the myocyte specifically. She proposes that NOD-like receptors (NLR's) create a platform for regulation of the IL-1 family members through caspase-1, suggesting a role in both innate and adaptive immunity for the inflammasome. Her work is currently determining if NLR's are essential in mediating the inflammatory response in the heart in response to thermal injury and thermal injury complicated with sepsis, suggesting that inflammasomes are differentially expressed in the heart, responding to a tier like system where upregulation of at least two components is required to assemble functional inflammasomes. This model suggests a concept of tissue inflammation privilege, and may provide insight into the response of the heart to stress. The results of this project are aimed at targeting specific mechanisms of IL-1 member induced cardiac dysfunction in the heart, and in specific cell types, such as the myocyte after injury, to allow the use in clinical practices of established therapies such as estrogen regulation, caspase 1 inhibition and cardiac P2X7 inhibitors more selectively to allow directed cytokine regulation.Dr. Cindy Darnell focuses her research on the delineation and improvement of the effectiveness and mitigation of the undesirable effects of the sedative and analgesic medications commonly used in the care of patients in the intensive care unit. She is the site investigator for the RESRORE proticol, an NIH funded study on the implementation of a sedation weaning protocol in critically ill children. Dr. Archana Dhar is the Principal Investigator (PI) of an IRB-approved retrospective study comparing the clinical characteristics of children admitted to the pediatric intens ive care unit with seasonal influenza versus novel influenza H1N1. She also serves as Sub-PI for a national study sponsored by the Department of Health and Human Services: Novel Influenza A (H1N1) Surveillance Registry, and is involved in an IRB-approved study titled \"Outcomes for liver transplantation for acute liver failure in children, specifically use of CVVHD, ICP monitors, plasma exchange: The Dallas experience.\" 49Critical Care MedicineThe laboratory of Dr. Steve Kernie, which includes new faculty member, Dr. Lakshmi Raman, continues to investigate how the developing brain responds to devastating injuries due to trauma or lack of oxygen. One area of focus is the very common clinical practice of administering pure oxygen to patients following brain injury. Researchers demonstrated that this practice can actually be harmful becau se it depletes vital precursor cells that ultimately form needed insulation or myelin around nerve cell projections. They found that mice exposed to these high levels of oxygen clinically developed an illness much like cerebral palsy that persisted long after the original brain injury occurred. This published work was accompanied by a press release in July 2008 that resulted in national attention from both the scientific and lay communities. Another area of interest centers on how brain stem cells become activated by injuries and then function to replace neighboring cells which are vulnerable to injury. This activation allows a very specific part of the brain, the hippocampus, to partially recover its important functions in learning and memory formation. Problems with learning and memory are among the most damaging sequelae following brain injuries due to trauma or lack of oxygen. These findings now allow researchers to begin investigating drugs that might be able to enhance this process of self-recovery. Dr. Joshua Koch serves as the site primary investigator for the multi-center trial, Therapeutic Hypothermia After Pediatric Cardiac Arrest (THAPCA). This trial is funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and began enrollment on September 1, 2009. He is also primary investigator for the project, Prospective Analysis of Regional Cerebral Perfusion Using Head Ultrasound and Multi-Source-Detector Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) Imaging. Dr. Peter Luckett's current research interests include clinical trials in pediatric critical care. In 2002 he was an initial organizing member of the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury and Sepsis Investigators (PALISI) clinical trials group. This group recently completed a collaboration with members of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network (ARDSnet) as part of the NIH Roadmap contract mechanism entitled \"Reengineering Clinical Research in Critical Care.\" This project involved the development, validation and distribution to naive sites of a computer-based decision support tool for glucose control in adult and pediatric ICUs. An application to the NIH for a large multi-center trial of glucose control in critically ill children is pending. Dr. Luckett is a co-investigator and the site PI for this project. Dr. Darryl Miles has continued his work to understand the pathophysiology unique to childhood brain injury and to investigate the mechanisms of traumatic brain injury and neural self-repair. It is his desire to contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies, ultimately improving the neuro-cognitive outcome of pediatric acquired brain injury. His work using transgenic mouse models has demonstrated that immature neuronal and glial progenitors are selectively vulnerable to various insults such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and contribute to the neural remodeling response. In the transition from basic science to clinical investigation, he is a contributing member of the Brain and Nerve Injury Center (BNIC) and is the CMC site principal investigator on a NIH funded study to investigate how genetic polymorphism affect long-term developmental outcome in children after moderate and severe TBI. Dr. Miles is currently analyzing MRI and CT findings in children with moderate to severe TBI to identify patterns of injury and their relationship to neuro-cognitive outcome. This analysis hopefully will serve as a basis for future studies in children, using advanced neuro-imaging techniques to elucidate the brain's acute and remodeling response to TBI.During lung formation, alterations in vessel growth contribute to dysfunctional lung development. The research of Dr. Margaret Schwarz focuses on the contributions that the vasculature brings to functional lung development. In order to better examine this concept, focus has been placed on the individual vessel types as well as their ability to influence the distal lung cells to exchange oxygen. Researchers specifically look at the influence that known vascular growth factors have on other cell types that have typically not been determined to be responsive to vascular growth factors. Within this context they have developed specific models that examine whether immature cells that are capable of becoming oxygen-exchanging cells are able to make this morphogenic change when exposed to vascular-specific growth factors. Their endpoint is to identify whether morphogenesis of these immature cells is impacted. Identifying those factors that have multi-cellular targets will greatly expand the understanding of lung development, leading to new therapeutic targets to treat disease processes that result in abnormal lung development. Dr. James Thomas focuses his work on the investigation of how the host senses and responds to injury and infection on a molecular level. Advances stemming from research in Drosophila (fruit flies) development and the Human Genome Project uncovered a highly conserved family of mammalian proteins - the toll-like receptors (TLRs) - that detect microbial invasion and tissue injury and trigger local and systemic responses to contain the insult. These receptors communicate with the cell's interior, using signaling proteins common to all the TLRs as well as the interleukin-1 50 Critical Care Medicinefamily of receptors. He has worked to genetically inactivate two critical intracellular signaling proteins - IRAK1 and IRAK2 - and is studying their function in the innate and adaptive immune response, including the development of sytemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in humans and the acute inflammatory response to infection in murine and in vitro models. Dr. Modem Vinai focuses his research efforts on the effect of fluid removal through renal replacement therapy in children with acute inflammation, and the development of a database on the outcome of patients treated with this modality. Clinical Activities 2010 was a year of continued productivity and enhanced clinical care for the Division of Critical Care Medicine, with admissions remaining over 3,000 for the year. The division, in collaboration with the Division of Cardiology and the Heart Center, provides state-of-the-art cardiovascular critical care services for children with congenital heart disease as well as other cardiac diseases. There were 700 additional admissions of complex cardiac disease to the Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit for this academic year. As a leading provider of critical care services, the division does not measure or define the success of efforts by patient volume or bed number, but rather by the specialization of care that is offered and the quality outcomes of patients. Th e I C U a t L e g a c y c a m p u s o ff e r e d 2 4 / 7 c o v e r a g e o f c r i t i c a l l y i l l children, as well as monitoring of post-operative and chronically ventilated patients, under the leadership of Dr. Raymond Nkwantabisa. The Legacy campus counts with all supporting sub-specialties. Dr. Maeve Sheehan, provided physician leadership the Children's transport program and Access Center, two integral patient care services that differentiate critical care medicine within the regional market. Under her leadership Children's Medical Center Transport system has an established reputation as a leader in the region. Dr. Archana Dhar, Associate Director of the Pediatric Critical Care Fellowship Program provided leadership on the education and training of the next generation of Pediatric Intensivists. The ECMO program under the leadership of Dr. Marita Thompson and supported by Raju Meyappam and James Thomas continues to provide state of the art care for critically ill children. Under the leadership of Dr. Steve Kernie, senior faculty member and Medical Director of the Perot Family Center for Brain and Nerve Injuries, the division has seen improvement and standardization of the clinical practice and long-term follow-up for children with brain injuries. The Perot Center has been instrumental to the support of clinical trials in the area of neuroprotection. Under the leadership of Dr. Fiona Levy, a senior member of the division and Vice President for Quality at Children's, the critical care division has refined performance improvement efforts as evidenced by widespread participation of the division faculty in various quality improvement projects. Dr. Cindy Darnell's efforts on organ procurement education have been decisive to improve the lives of chronically ill children through awareness and education on the potential of organ donation. Dr. Susan Morris has taken a leadership role on critical care education through simulation scenarios at our state-of-the-art simulation center. Dr. Leslie Garner has provided exemplary service as the division leader for both residency and medical student education during PICU rotations. Dr. Joshua Wolovitz in collaboration with the Respiratory Department, headed by Brian Walsh, RRT., developed Clinical Guidelines for ventilator weaning. Dr. Michael Green, a Pediatric Intensivist trained at Children's Hospital, Boston, MA. Harvard medical School and Teresa Zuluaga, M.D. a Pediatric Intensivist trained at Children's Hospital, University of San Francisco, joined the Pediatric Critical Care Faculty at Children's Medical Center. 51 Critical Care MedicinePresentations/Teaching Activities Divisional teaching activities for residents, fellows and medical students take place during the care of critically ill children and with specific didactic curriculums that foster intellectual exchange and the life-long habit to question and learn. The principal teaching platform is daily rounds; however, admissions, resuscitations and major interventions all provide hands-on learning opportunities. This bedside teaching is complemented by didactic sessions specifically tailored for the level of training o f r es i de n ts an d f ell o ws. C ri ti cal car e p racti ce is based o n team effort, and teaching activities are focused on the education and participation of team members, including nursing and respiratory therapy colleagues. At weekly division conferences, clinical cases, review of quality standard practices and divisional performance is assessed. Additionally, monthly division research conferences allow review of research works and evaluation of fellows' progress toward completion of research projects. A weekly critical care curriculum for fellows ensures that trainees at all levels develop the foundational knowledge necessary for the practice of high-quality clinical care.

It is one of the largest such divisions in the country and is the only major program caring for children with diabetes in the Dallas metropolitan area. Because the division cares for such a large number of children with these disorders within a very large catchment area - a 100 to 150-mile radius in most directions - it is in a unique position to provide fellowship training and conduct clinical research. The division was created 15 years ago and has grown from a minimum of three faculty members to 14 full-time and two part-time faculty members, three of whom also have M.P.H. or Ph.D. degrees. Five faculty members have active research programs that have received competitive funding. The fellowship program accepted its first extramural fellow in 1999 and has grown to accept two fellows per year, all of whom have been fully American-trained. Approximately half of the fellows come from the medical school's own pediatric residency program. The fellowship program emphasizes both broad and deep clinical training as well as experience in clinical research, bench research or both. All of the fellows have published their fellowship projects as one or more papers in peer-reviewed literature, and the majority of division graduates take academic positions at UT Southwestern or other medical schools. Teaching is a top priority, and several fellows and faculty members have won local teaching awards from medical students or residents. A high value is placed on community service. Many faculty members volunteer at two local diabetes camps run by the division, and two serve as medical directors for the camps. Faculty Perrin C. White, M.D., Professor, was the first to hold the Audre Newman Rapoport Distinguished Chair in Pediatric Endocrinology. He was recruited to UT Southwestern as Director of the Pediatric Endocrinology program in 1994 from Cornell University Medical College in New Y ork where he was Professor of Pediatrics. Dr. White has studied several genetic diseases of steroid hormone biosynthesis and metabolism including the most common forms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. More recently he has concentrated on translational research including studies of gene expression in white blood cells from children with either Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes mellitus and a pilot study of a potent anti-inflammatory agent, anakinra, in patients with new-onset Type 1 diabetes. Dr. White received his A.B., magna cum laude , from Harvard College, Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1972, and his M.D. from Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, in 1976. He held residencies in pediatrics at Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland, from 1976 to 1978 and at New Y ork Hospital from 1980 to 1981, and he held a research fellowship in developmental molecular biology at Rockefeller University, New Y ork, from 1978 to 1980. He has received a number of awards and honors, including the Ernst Oppenheimer Award of the Endocrine Society and the Mead-Johnson Award of the Society for Pediatric Research. He has served on numerous advisory committees for the National Institutes of Health and on several editorial boards.

Supported by the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, she and Dr. Perrin White are following up these results in test tube studies to see what factors in serum \u2014 such as fatty acids \u2014 are responsible for triggering this inflammation and to try to eludicate the intracellular signaling pathways by which this happens. Additionally, Drs. Soumya Adhikari and Kathryn Sumpter have conducted a pilot study of a powerful anti-inflammatory agent \u2014 anakinra \u2014 in children with new-onset Type 1 diabetes to see if it might be safely used to prolong the honeymoon period in which some insulin secretion remains. Additional studies are planned with a more powerful related agent. Several faculty members are conducting research on obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Dr. Kamal Bharucha is trying to identify genes influencing fat storage and metabolism in Drosophila (fruit flies). Dr. Michele Hutchison has studied the natural history of progression to insulin dependence among children with Type 2 diabetes. She has also found a very high prevelance of vitamin D defciency among patients in the obesity clinic and has found that this is associated with biochemical changes predisposing to Type 2 diabetes. Finally, Dr. Hutchison conducts NIH-supported basic research on how bones grow at specialized zones of cartilage termed growth plates and industry-sponsored clinical research on the therapy of short stature with the growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-1. Clinical Activities The Division of Pediatric Endocrinology continues to grow rapidly to meet the rising demands of the community. Since 2002, the division has more than doubled in size to meet the increase in clinical volume from 5,000 visits per year to more than 13,000 visits in 2010. The division comprises 15 full- and part-time faculty members this year who provide comprehensive care for children with endocrine disorders, obesity and diabetes. The Endocrinology Center provides 10 half-day clinic sessions per week for patients, including approximately 2,500 new patient consultations yearly. The Diabetes Program provides a comprehensive bilingual education program for both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes and is one of only four pediatric programs in Texas certified by the American Diabetes Association. The diabetes program was also the first pediatric program in the country to receive disease-specific certification from the Joint Commission. The Center for Obesity and its Consequences in Health (COACH) clinic continues to provide the only comprehensive program for childhood obesity in North Texas, with more than 70Endocrinology600 referrals per year. Expansion of the clinic to the Children's at Legacy campus provides approximately 1,100 visits per year in this fast-growing area of North Texas. The development of clinical research studies and interventional trials has increased significantly in the division over the past year and provides an opportunity to incorporate leading-edge technology into the care of the patient population. The endocrinology inpatient service provides care for more than 600 patients admitted to the service yearly, including 260 patients with new onset diabetes. In addition, the Endocrinology inpatient service will provide approximately 300 consultations to other services during the same time period.

This nationally recognized division includes distinguished individuals focusing on diverse areas of Gastroenterology, including molecular biology of cholestatic liver disease, neurogastroenterology, chronic viral hepatitus, inflammatory bowel disease, therapeutic endoscopy, and intestinal rehabilitation and transplantation of liver and intestine. Six additional faculty joined our division last year. We are pleased to recognize recruitment of three additional clinical gastroenterologists, Drs. Aakash Goyal, Koorosh Kooros and Charina Ramirez, increasing the number of full time gastroenterologists to thirteen. In addition, Dr. Gabriela Reed, psychologist, joined our group full time. Finally, two new basic science investigators, Drs. Amal Dutta and Qin Li, work in the general area of regulation of hepatobiliary secretion under the aegis of Dr. Andrew Feranchak. There are sixteen Southwestern faculty in our division. In addition to the faculty additions, three nurse practitioners, Jody Mackling, Constance Van Alstyne, LaJontee Ware, and three physician assistants, Devechio Edwards, Heather Trant, Tracy Xu, joined the division to staff the newly established inpatient unit devoted to liver, intestinal failure and transplantation. These six advanced practice providers join five additional GI nurse practitioners working primarily in the outpatient clinics. Under Dr. Michael Russo's leadership, the full service outreach consultative practice at Children's at Legacy is thriving with three full-time and three part-time providers. Next year we anticipate opening an outreach GI consultation clinic in Southlake. Specialized multidisciplinary clinics include: t\u0001Chronic abdominal pain (GI, anesthesiology/pain management, psychology) t\u0001Aero-digestive disorders (GI, ENT, pulmonary, psychology) t\u0001Cystic fibrosis (GI, pulmonary, nutrition, psychology) t\u0001Inflammatory bowel disease (GI, nutrition, psychology) t\u0001Intestinal failure (GI, surgery, nutrition and psychology) Six gastroenterology fellows (two annually) train in basic research areas throughout UT Southwestern: hepatobiliary transport physiology, eosinophilic esophagitis, pathobiology of pruritus with chronic liver disease, metabolic liver disease, and immunobiology of IBD. Faculty John M. Andersen, M.D. , Professor is the Director of Pediatric Gastroenterology at UT Southwestern and Children's Medical Center. In addition to general pediatric gastroenterology, his clinical specialties and areas of research are cyclic vomiting syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease and eosinophilic esophagitis.

Hepatology, both basic and clinical, comprises the most active area of investigation. Dr. Andrew Feranchak is recognized internationally for his innovative approaches to elucidating the basic mechanisms regulating biliary secretion and mechanisms of bile formation using in vitro models employing well characterized hepatocyte and cholangiocyte cell lines. More specifically his laboratory is investigating the regulatory role of purinergic signaling in biliary secretion and bile formation. Dr. Feranchak's research is pivotal, since it is very likely that therapeutic interventions for cholestatic liver disease await a basic understanding of the basic mechanisms of bile flow. Dr. Norberto Rodriguez-Baez is the principle investigator at our site for a national, multicenter, NIH-supported study examining the causes for fulminant hepatic failure in children. Dr. Rodriguez-Baez's second group of studies involves treatment of chronic hepatitis B and C. The second general area of active clinical research involves inflammation in the GI tract. Dr. Ashish Patel is leader of the nutritional management algorithm development for the Trailblazer Collaborative for pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Dr. John Andersen is investigating new treatments for eosinophilic esophagitis.

In the patient-centered environment, thirteen gastroenterology physicians, eight gastroenterology nurse practitioners, three physician assistants, and a child psychologist embedded in the gastroenterology program, provide multidisciplinary, comprehensive state-of-the-art care for children with virtually any gastrointestinal or liver problem.Isabel Rojas, M.D. Research interests: Itching in colestasis Lillienne Y oon, M.D. Research interests: Transitioning adolescents with to adult care; esophagitis and Chron's disease 77GastroenterologyIn addition to gastroenterologists, outpatients are seen in parallel by four nurse practitioners with the support of six nurse-coordinators and five medical assistants. The gastroenterology laboratory staff of five nurses and two medical assistants is capable of supporting not only routine endoscopic procedures, but also therapeutic endoscopy (ERCP, balloon enteroscopy and capsule endoscopy) and a full range of motility procedures (anorectal, esophageal, antroduodenal, small bowel and colonic). The entire program is supported by a psychologist, two full-time dieticians, child-life, social work, a pharmacist and an enterostomal therapist/educator.

The Divisi on has recognized national leadership in research, health policy and advocacy regarding racial and ethnic disparities in child health and healthcare, and in improving access to and quality of care for underserved populations of children. In 2010, Division faculty supervised the care of over 9,800 patients seen by pediatric residents in the Resident Continuity Clinic. Over 6,000 additional patients were seen in our specialized clinics, and our attending physicians cared for over 2,000 hospitalized children on the inpatient teaching services, while providing outstanding teaching to pediatric residents and UT Southwestern medical students. The Division established the Medical-Legal Partnership at Children's Medical Center, which aims to improve the health and well-being of vulnerable individuals, children, and families by integrating legal services into the medical setting. A partnership was established with Los Barrios Unidos Community Clinic as UT Southwestern's newest Pediatric Continuity Clinic site and an additional clinical setting where our bilingual faculty provide care to children. Los Barrios U nidos Comm unity Clinic is a Federally Qualified Health Cen ter (FQ H C ) that is accredited by The Join t Commission. The clinic works to improve health and quality of life by providing a medical home for individuals and families. It serves a low-income, predominantly Spanish primary language population in Dallas. Four residents and two attending physicians provided care at Los Barrios in 2010. Since the last annual report, division faculty published 11 articles, including articles in Pediatrics , Academic Pediatrics , Journal of Immunology , Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology , MD Advisor , Contemporary Pediatrics , Patient Education and Counseling and Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics . Our two Academic General Pediatrics fellows presented abstracts at the 2010 Pediatric Academic Societies meetings, including a platform presentation and three poster presentations. Division faculty garnered numerous honors and awards, including appointment to the United States Preventive Services Task Force, an R01 grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), the 2010 Helen Rodr\u00edguez-Tr\u00edas Social Justice Award from the American Public Health Association, the Child Advocate of the Year award from the Children's Advocacy Center of Collin County, recognition as a Texas Super Doctor by Texas Monthly , recognition as The Best Pediatric Specialists in Dallas 2010 (for three faculty) and Best Doctors in Dallas by D Magazine , recognition in the Guide to America's Top Pediatricians by Consumer Research in America, a nomination to the Gamma Chapter of Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society, a UT Southwestern Outstanding Teacher Award from the Classes of 2012 and 2013, a UT Southwestern Pre-Clinical Teaching in Clinical Medicine Award from the Class of 2012, selection as a finalist in the UT Southwestern Innovation in Health Science Education Award, an educational grant from the University of Texas Health Sciences Foundation's Small Grants Program, a UT Southwestern Faculty Teaching Award in Pediatric Residency, a UT Southwestern Core Clerkship Teaching Award from the Class of 2010, a UT Southwestern Clinical Research Scholars Award, a grant from the Program for the Development and Evaluation of Model Community Initiatives in Dallas (PDEMCHID), election to the American Society of Clinical Nutrition, and a Community Access to Child Health (CATCH) grant from the American Academy of Pediatrics.

The division was the first clinic in North Texas to accept referrals from the Texas Department of Health's newborn screening program for biochemical disorders, and is the largest clinic specializing in the diagnosis and treatment of children with inborn errors of metabolism in North Texas. Referrals are received from all of the other children's hospitals in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex as well as from more distant areas. Faculty and staff operate the only multispecialty clinic for patients with Down syndrome in the region and have special interests in the diagnosis and management of a variety of other genetic conditions such as Marfan syndrome, osteogeneisis imperfecta and other disorders of skeletal development. The division also provides clinical services for the major clinical laboratories at UT Southwestern that deal with genetic conditions including the molecular diagnosis, cytogenetics and metabolic disease laboratories. The division is a vital part of UT Southwestern's programs for training medical students, residents, fellows and allied health professionals. Faculty play a major teaching role in the first year of the medical school program and train third-year medical students as part of their pediatric rotation. They also play an important part in the Pediatrics and Medical Genetics residency programs. Dr. Ralph DeBerardinis continues to expand the division's research efforts in areas that include cellular regulation of metabolism in normal cells and in cancer and in the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric metabolic diseases. He operates a basic science laboratory at UT Southwestern, coordinates the newborn screening referral service at Children's, and attends on the in-patient Pediatric Genetics and Metabolism service. Faculty Perrin C. White, M.D., Professor, was the first to hold the Audre Newman Rapoport Distinguished Chair in Pediatric Endocrinology. He was recruited to UT Southwestern as Director of the Pediatric Endocrinology program in 1994 from Cornell University Medical College in New York, where he was Professor of Pediatrics. In 2010, he assumed the role of Interim Director of the Pediatric Genetics & Metabolism program. Dr. White has conducted research on several genetic diseases of steroid hormone biosynthesis and metabolism including the most common forms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Dr. White received his A.B., magna cum laude , from Harvard College, Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1972, and his M.D. from Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, in 1976. He held residencies in pediatrics at Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland, from 1976 to 1978 and at New York Hospital from 1980 to 1981, and he held a research fellowship in developmental molecular biology at Rockefeller University, New York, from 1978 to 1980. He has received a number of awards and honors, including the Ernst Oppenheimer Award of the Endocrine Society and the Mead-Johnson Award of the Society for Pediatric Research. He has served on numerous advisory committees for the National Institutes of Health and on several editorial boards.

In order to produce daughter cells, which occur with each round of the cell cycle, cells need to double their biomass (proteins, lipids and nucleic acids). This is a tremendous challenge requiring energy, building blocks and the coordination of a large number of metabolic pathways. Dr. DeBerardinis is exploring the idea that these metabolic activities are orchestrated by growth factor-stimulated signal transduction pathways, which direct cells to take up abundant nutrients and allocate them into the proper metabolic pathways. He wants to understand how signal transduction impacts metabolic fluxes during physiologic states of cell proliferation (e.g., embryogenesis, wound healing, activation of the immune system) and during pathological states (e.g., cancer). To do this, the DeBerardinis lab uses a combination of techniques in molecular biology, cell biology and biochemistry, coupled with metabolic flux analysis using mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance, and animal models of metabolism and cancer. Current projects include developing imaging probes to identify abnormal metabolic activities in tumor and in children with metabolic diseases. Clinical Activities The Division's clinical activities at Children's are focused in three areas. Faculty and staff in the Down syndrome clinic have more than fifty collective years of experience in caring for children with Down syndrome and provide comprehensive treatment for children and their families including medical management, genetic counseling, physical, speech and motor development evaluation and recommendations, psychosocial support, screening and referral for behavioral and psychiatric problems and referral to community agencies for educational intervention or therapies. Children with conditions involving birth defects, developmental delay or mental retardation, metabolic disorders or known or suspected genetic disorders receive evaluation and testing in the Genetics Clinic. Chromosomal metabolic and DNA analysis for diagnosis of genetic disease is provided, as well as psychosocial assessment, nutritional evaluation and counseling and comprehensive case management with referral to medical specialists, community resources and support groups. Family history analysis and genetic counseling to discuss reproductive options also are available. The Metabolic Disease Service provides evaluation and testing for children with known or suspected inborn errors of metabolism as well as education about specific inborn errors of metabolism. Blood, urine, enzyme and DNA analyses are performed for diagnosis and treatment, and nutritional evaluation and counseling and psychosocial assessment are provided. The Metabolic Disease Service also functions as a major referral center for the Texas Newborn Screening Program. This state-wide program seeks to identify newborn babies with any of 29 different treatable diseases, many of which are genetic/metabolic in nature. A large fraction of the 405,000 babies born in Texas each year are evaluated at Children's. When a baby in North Texas is found to have a metabolic abnormality on the newborn screen, the family is referred to our team for definitive diagnosis, treatment, and long-term care if necessary. Through the Texas Newborn Screening Program, more than 75 children with metabolic diseases are identified each year, and the coordinated care of these children by the Metabolic Disease Service at Children's significantly improves their survival and development. Presentations/Teaching Activities Division faculty are involved in the training of UT Southwestern's first-year medical students, specifically in the biochemistry, genetics and embryology courses. Dr. Waber is the director of the embryology course and co-director of the genetics course. As part of their pediatric rotation, third-year medical students rotate through the outpatient clinics and are provided with a case conference. The division manages a Medical Genetics residency training program and is an important part of the Pediatrics residency program. 97Genetics / MetabolismRalph DeBerardinis, M.D., Ph.D. t\u0001\"Molecular Basis for the Reprogramming of Cancer Cell Metabolism, \" International Workshop for Translational Research on Malignant Gliomas, Naples, Italy, February 2010 t\u0001\"Understanding Mitochondrial Metabolism in Tumor Growth, \" Symposium on Cancer Metabolism, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada, March 2010 t\u0001\" Alternative Metabolic Strategies for Growth in Glio blastoma: Glucose vs. Glutamine for Support of cell Proliferation and Tumorigenesis, \" Metabolism and Cancer Progression, Keystone Symposium, Vancouver, Canada, March 2010 t\u0001\"The Diverse Functions of Glutamine in Metabolism, Cell Biology and Cancer, \" Johnson and Johnson, Teleconference, April 2010 t\u0001\"Cancer Therapy Based on Integrated Understanding of Cancer Genetics and Metabolism, \" Symposium and Training XVIII: Intermediary Metabolism and Cancer, Dallas, TX 2010 t\u0001\"The Warburg Effect, The Truncated TCA Cycle, and Other Metabolic Targets in Tumor Cells, \" Pfizer, Pearl River, NY , July 2010 t\u0001\"Mitochondrial Metabolism in Tumor Cells: Forgotten, But Not Gone, \" Cancer and Metabolism: Pathways to the Future Conference, Edinburgh, Scotland, September 2010 t\u0001\"Multidisciplinary Studies in Tumor Metabolism: Meta bolic Targets in Glioblastoma, \" CPRIT Innovations Conference, Austin, TX, November 2010 t\u0001Lecturer, Medical Genetics (first-year medical students) t\u0001Lecturer, Cancer Biology (first-year graduate students) t\u0001Lecturer, Cases in Medical Genetics (third-year medical students) Lewis J.

The division is nationally distinguished for its design and conduct of investigator-initiated and NIH-funded multi-center clinical trials involving childhood cancer, sickle cell disease and hemorrhagic disorders. As the major program of its kind in North Texas and one of the 10 largest in the United States, the division provides care in the Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders (CCBD) at Children's to hundreds of patients with uncommon and complex disorders, and also offers outreach that includes educational and consultative resources for primary and referring physicians in the region. The program continues to grow considerably by expanding its patient numbers despite competitive and managed care pressures. In 2010 Children's Medical Center's Oncology Program was ranked No.16 in the United States by U.S. News and World Report, again the highest ranking of any medical subspecialty program at Children's. More than $20 million in community philanthropic support has been garnered during the past three years in recognition of the program's reputation. In addition, more than $3 million in research grants from NIH and other peer-reviewed funding agencies was awarded to Hematology-Oncology investigators. A number of faculty members received awards and other forms of national recognition for their outstanding work during 2010. Areas of continued growth in the near future include stem cell transplantation, neuroblastoma, sickle cell disease, thrombosis and basic research in cancer. The division's ultimate goal is to become among the top five to 10 blood and cancer programs in the world. This year also brought with it plans for a major leadership change. Early in the year, Dr. George Buchanan, Division Director, announced his plans to step down from the leadership position he has held since 1980. Dr. Buchanan will, however, remain actively engaged in teaching, mentoring, consultative care and clinical research. The Department Chair, Dr. George Lister, assembled a search committee of local academic and administrative leaders and conducted a rigorous national search for a new Director. As 2010 ended, a finalist was identified who hopefully will take the helm of the CCBD by the summer of 2011. Continued progress was made in the expansion of clinical facilities for the CCBD. In December 2007, the program's outpatient activities temporarily moved to the third floor of the Bright Building, across the street from the main hospital facility. The renovated space more than doubled the size of the previous clinic. A major development during 2009 was the move to a new 24-bed inpatient Hematology-Oncology facility at Children's on the sixth floor of the new Tower D. With substantial advice from a Family Council of patients' parents, the unit was designed to optimize comfort for patients and families. It includes 12 beds specifically designed for stem cell transplantation. The CCBD also was provided additional beds in the adjacent Tower C. Construction of an entirely new outpatient unit will begin in early 2011, with the aim of completing the first phase by the end of the year. At that time the hematology component of the CCBD will move from its Bright Building location to the new facility, followed during the next 18 to 24 months by completion of the project, bringing the oncology outpatient clinic, pharmacy, satellite laboratory and infusion room/day hospital into operation. The final step in the CCBD \"master plan\" will involve construction of administrative space on B6 and ten additional inpatient beds on C6. The CCBD Family Counsil continue to be instrumental in providing practical guidance regarding how this new space will best serve our patients and families. A major area of growth during 2010 was the Hematopoietic Stem Cell (Bone Marrow) Transplantation Program under the leadership Dr. Andrew Koh, who joined the UT Southwestern faculty in July 2009 following his recruitment from the Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School in Boston. His arrival has fostered successful fundraising, completion of the new 12-bed transplant unit within the 24-bed Tower D6 Hematology-Oncology Unit, faculty recruitment and a new model for inpatient coverage of children receiving transplantation by a cadre of experienced mid-level providers. Dr. Koh has successfully engineered new managed care contracts and collaborative arrangements with other pediatric oncology centers in the South and Southwest to establish Children's as a major referral center for patients in need of transplantation. Plans are to recruit additional clinical and laboratory transplant specialists during 2011 and early 2012. An additional development during 2010 was the growth of the clinical and translational research program in neuroblastoma spearheaded by Dr. Amy Pass, who has developed excellent connections with the national neuroblastoma research community. Her work is being supported by Wipe Out Kids' Cancer, one of the Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders' outstanding local fundraising organizations. Hematology-oncology patient activities at the Children's at Legacy campus began in May 2008 in Legacy's Ambulatory Pavilion, and in early 2009 an inpatient service was initiated for selected children with cancer and hematologic conditions. To support the continued growth of this program, four full-time faculty physicians in the CCBD now devote much of their time to clinical activities on the Legacy as well as Dallas campuses. These additional faculty and support staff will assure the continued success of the Legacy project, one of the first of its kind in the United States to 99Hematology-Oncologyprovide complex hematologic and cancer care in a suburban facility tightly linked to a world-class academic \"mother ship.\" The outpatient CCBD facility at Legacy had more than 3,500 visits by patients during 2010. In addition to the growth of the clinical facilities, laboratory space at UT Southwestern has been appreciably expanded and modernized to assure the continued growth of basic and translational research conducted by the Hematology-Oncology faculty. The CCBD faculty continues to be recognized at many levels for its excellence. For example, three of its faculty, Drs. Andrew Koh, Shelley Crary and Cindy Neunert, were among the four Department of Pediatric faculty members selected to become new members of the Society for Pediatric Research during 2010. Other honors during the year included Dr. George Buchanan's receipt in November 2010 of the Arnold Gold Award for Humanism in Medicine from the American Association of Medical Colleges. Equally noteworthy are research grant awards received by faculty members in 2010, including grants to Dr. James Amatruda from the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT). Faculty George R. Buchanan, M.D., Professor and Division Director, is the Medical Director for the CCBD, Director of the Barrett Family Center for Pediatric Oncology at UT Southwestern and Director of the Southwestern Comprehensive Sickle Cell Center. Dr. Buchanan holds the Children's Cancer Fund Distinguished Chair in Pediatric Oncology and Hematology and is nationally known for his expertise in sickle hemoglobinopathies, hemorrhagic disorders and general hematology. Research interests include sickle cell disease, immune thrombocytopenia, hereditary spherocytosis and iron deficiencies. He serves as research advisor and mentor to medical students, residents, fellows and junior faculty engaged in or planning careers in academic pediatric hematology-oncology. Dr. Buchanan graduated with honors from Drake University, Des Moines, Iowa, in 1966 and earned his medical degree at the University of Chicago in 1970. He performed his residency in pediatrics at Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago from 1970 to 1973 and was then a fellow in hematology at Children's Hospital and in pediatric oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. He received Teaching Excellence Awards on numerous occasions from students, residents, and fellows at UT Southwestern. Dr. Buchanan has been repeatedly recognized as one of the \"Best Doctors in Americ a. \" He served as President of the American Society of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and on the Executive Committee of the American Society of Hematology. In 2007 he received the Distinguished Career Award from the Americ an Society of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, in 2008 was the recipient of the Mentor Award in Clinical Research from the American Society of Hematology and in 2010 received the Arnold Gold Award for Humanism in Medicine from the American Association of Medical Colleges.

The laboratory research of Drs. Matthew Porteus, Scott Cameron, Mark Hatley and James Amatruda has been supported by 28 students, trainees and research staff. The division's clinical research infrastructure is based primarily at Children's. Thirteen clinical research associates and three research nurses, managed by Leah Adix and Jennifer Evans, handle research protocol formatting, data analysis, consent form design, IRB and HIPAA regulatory oversight, sample acquisition, data collection and analysis. This team works closely with counterparts in the Clinical Research Department at Children's and with UT Southwestern's Cancer Center and Institutional Review Board. Advanced practice nurses and nurse clinicians play a major role in the clinical and research programs. These programs include four advanced-practice nurses in sickle cell disease and chronic blood transfusion therapy, two in stem cell transplantation, one in neuro-oncology, two in late effects/cancer survivorship, one in hemophilia/thrombosis and four in general oncology. Three nurses function exclusively in research, enrolling and monitoring patients with cancer and hematologic disease in diverse investigative protocols. Other Children's support staff include clinic and inpatient nurses, registration personnel, medical assistants, social workers, pharmacists, nutritionists, child life associates, an interpreter, a child life assistant, a cancer registrar, a telephone receptionist, a new-patient coordinator, an outreach manager and personnel in collaborating departments such as pastoral care and physical therapy. Kaye Schmidt, Senior Director, provides administrative leadership in the CCBD, working closely with Drs. George Buchanan, Patrick Leavey, and Jon Wickiser to assure the efficient, effective and safe operation of all clinical activities. Barbara Obert, Operations Director, and Kathy Carlisle, Nursing Director, are also on the CCBD leadership team. Research Activities Oncology Each Hematology-Oncology faculty physician participates in joint clinical research projects, particularly involving the Children's Oncology Group (COG), in which Dr. Naomi Winick is the center's Principal Investigator. All faculty members in the division are members of COG, an NIH-funded multi-institutional consortium of cancer research centers. In addition to clinical research in COG, the division conducts a number of in-house therapeutic studies for children with cancer, including innovative research programs in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and Phase I and II trials for patients with advanced malignancies of various types. Other institutional research studies focus on genetic alterations, late effects in survivors, anxiety and depression, and supportive care in cancer patients. Hematology Numerous clinical studies involving hematology patients (sickle cell disease, hereditary spherocytosis, thrombosis, immune thrombocytopenia (ITP)) also are being carried out by faculty and fellows; many are multi-center trials supported by the NIH. The program was funded by the NHLBI as one of 10 comprehensive sickle cell centers to participate in a clinical trials consortium, and Children's is currently one of a select group of children's hospitals nationally involved in a Sickle Cell Disease Basic and Translational Research Program initiated in April 2008. The division also is a member of the NHLBI-supported Transfusion Medicine-Hemostasis Clinical Trials Network. In addition to these multi-center studies, more than a dozen local investigator-initiated research projects in hematology were completed during 2010 or are currently in progress. Laboratory Research L a b o r a t o r y r e s e a r c h i n t h e d i v i s i o n d u r i n g 2 0 1 0 w a s c o n d u c t e d by several outstanding physician-scientists - Drs. Scott Cameron, Matthew Porteus, Andrew Koh, Mark Hatley and James Amatruda. Dr. Amatruda trained in zebrafish genetics with the world's expert at Harvard and has established a robust investigative program in this area at UT Southwestern. Each of these scientists has received local awards or is principal investigator on R01 grants from the NIH for recognition of their outstanding accomplishments and future potential. The presence of these bench scientists on the Hematology-Oncology faculty has greatly enhanced the division's visibility both locally and nationally. Efforts are under way to recruit additional physician-scientists to the faculty during 2011, a prospect brightened by new divisional leadership and additional resources. 107Hematology-OncologyClinical Research The clinical research program in Hematology-Oncology has grown substantially during the past decade. The outstanding clinical research infrastructure within the division - with separate components serving oncology and hematology - currently consists of 19 clinical research staff members. All of these positions are based at Children's in Dallas, and many are funded through peer-reviewed NIH grants supporting patient-oriented investigation in childhood cancer, sickle cell disease and hemostasis-thrombosis. Regular research meetings at which faculty and fellows informally present their research hypotheses and results are highly successful, attracting faculty, fellows and Hematology-Oncology clinical research support staff. Further evidence of the robust clinical research environment within the program is the fact that six hematology- oncology faculty members have been among the 20 to 25 NIH KL2 or CTSA grant-supported Clinical Research Scholars at UT Southwestern, while two other Clinical Scholars formally appointed in other divisions have focused their research on pediatric sickle cell disease with Dr. George Buchanan as their mentor. For seven consecutive years, fellows or junior faculty were selected to attend the American Society of Hematology's prestigious Clinical Research Training Institute (CRTI). Research Funding Three of the division's faculty have active laboratory research programs in molecular biology and biochemistry, receiving peer-reviewed grant support. Total research support for UT Southwestern faculty members in Hematology-Oncology during 2010 amounts to more than $3.4 million, primarily grants from National Cancer Institute (NCI) or NHLBI. In addition to the NIH-supported agencies, funding from other organizations includes the Maternal and Child Health Bureau of the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Children's Cancer Fund, Wipe Out Kids' Cancer, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the Amon G. Carter Foundation and the Lance Armstrong Foundation. Of note during 2010, three faculty members were Principal Investigators of R01 grants and three were supported in part by an institutional KL2 award as part of UT Southwestern's NIH-supported North and Central Texas Clinical and Translational Research Initiative (NCTCTRI). These are in addition to the numerous other grants and contracts from the NIH held by divisional faculty members. Long-range Research Program Goal The division's overall program objective \u2014 to establish at UT Southwestern and Children's one of the finest pediatric Hematology-Oncology programs in the world \u2014 remains unchanged. To achieve this goal, the division must first maintain its large and diverse patient base by creative and outreach marketing strategies, including successful development and growth of the Legacy program. Second, the division plans to recruit additional faculty to strengthen existing clinical and laboratory research and to explore new investigative areas. To maintain and advance the program's excellence, the recent receipt of NCI designation by UT Southwestern's Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center results in the CCBD being the only NCI-approved pediatric cancer program in North Texas. Expansion of the Cancer Center's clinical and investigative programs in clinical and basic oncology research will allow for enhanced collaborations and further growth of the critical mass of investigators on the campus with whom pediatric faculty and fellows will interact. At the divisional level, special attention is focused on recruiting several additional faculty whose major interests lie in the areas of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, molecular oncology, cancer immunology, stem cell biology, and vascular biology. Clinical Activities The CCBD has one of the Department of Pediatrics' largest subspecialty programs at Children's. Twenty-five to forty inpatients with cancer and hematologic disorders are usually under direct care in a dedicated 24-bed unit in Tower D and on other floors throughout the hospital. The attending physicians participate in teaching medical students and residents in addition to coordinating patient care and providing consultations. Various faculty members supervise one of three inpatient services (hematology, stem cell transplantation or oncology) during their rotations, which are two weeks in length 108Hematology-Oncologythroughout the year. During 2010 the clinical program continued to grow in total outpatient visits, inpatient days at both the Dallas and Legacy c am p u s e s an d , in p arti c ul ar , th e n um b e r o f n e w di a gn o s e s . Th e C C B D continues to be the largest - in terms of patient numbers - of all medical subspecialty programs at Children's. Hematology-Oncology carries out approximately 1,000 formal inpatient and outpatient consultations each year, providing diagnostic evaluations of children with anemia, bleeding disorders, and other hematologic disorders. The program saw a record 322 new patients with cancer in 2010, and has more than 400 cancer patients receiving active treatment at a given time. Approximately 1,000 additional patients have completed their treatment and are followed and monitored in the nationally-acclaimed \"After the Cancer Experience\" program. Unfortunately, 40 young cancer patients lost their fight during 2010, reflecting the fact that cancer remains the most common cause of death due to illness during childhood. A ten-year patient statistic summary is provided as an Appendix. Sixty to seventy-five patients are seen daily in outpatient clinic, staffed by three or four full-time faculty members and several fellows. Many of these children receive bone marrow aspiration, lumbar puncture, and intravenous drug treatments or blood products as part of their regular outpatient management. During 2010 there were more than 20,000 outpatient hematology-oncology visits to Children's outpatient facilities in Dallas and at Legacy. Hematology-Oncology has for years been Children's largest medical subspecialty outpatient program with regards to patient numbers. Outpatient statistics are included in the Appendix. The clinical service in the outpatient arena is structured around teams of physicians, nurses, social workers and research staff serving patients with hemophilia and thrombosis, sickle cell disease, general hematology, oncology, bone tumors, stem cell transplantation, long-term cancer follow-up (After the Cancer Experience, or ACE) and brain tumors. Each team meets weekly to discuss patient care issues, protocols, research and administrative activities. Patients are also discussed at weekly multidisciplinary departmental conferences to allow for all relevant staff members to be aware of major patient problems and to contribute to team decisions. New leukemia, solid tumor and complex follow-up cases are discussed at a weekly Tumor Board meeting. Cases involving brain tumors are discussed each week at a Neuro-oncology Tumor Board meeting. Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Program A key component of the hematology-oncology program is the hematopoietic stem cell transplantation program. Twelve of the 24 beds on the D6 inpatient Hematology-Oncology floor constitute the marrow transplant unit. These rooms contain high-efficiency particulate air filters and unidirectional air flow to reduce infection risk. More than 250 autologous and allogeneic marrow, peripheral blood stem cell or umbilical cord blood transplants have been performed since the program's inception in 1992, including 27 during 2010. A national search for a new stem cell transplant program director was successfully completed during 2009 with the appointment of Dr. Andrew Koh. He is rapidly establishing the program as a regional center of excellence. Outreach Outreach activities have been spearheaded by Dr. George Buchanan and Cristy Ecton, the Outreach Program Manager. Ms. Ecton is responsible for the division's public relations, marketing, and physician-relations efforts. She also serves as a liais on to fundraising and support groups and monitors relationships with referring physicians. Formal outreach clinics conducted by division members have included sickle cell clinics in Tyler, Texas, three to four times a year. On September 25, 2010, we held for the 12th consecutive year our highly successful Continuing Medical Education course for primary care physicians, directed by Dr. Zora Rogers. More than 50 attendees benefitted from the five-hour-long Saturday morning and early afternoon program. The CCBD continues to have an excellent reputation among referring physicians for its prompt consultative services. A full-time staff member at Children's - the new patient referral coordinator - handles incoming calls and schedules appointments, working closely with the \"referral doc,\" a full-time CCBD faculty physician who is available immediately to handle urgent requests as well as to answer questions and provide advice. 109Hematology-OncologyPresentations/Teaching Activities The faculty in the Division of Hematology-Oncology have made a major commitment to teaching medical students, residents, fellows, primary care and referring physicians, and other healthcare professionals. Teaching is done through one-on-one interactions, small groups, seminars and formal lectures in a variety of settings. The division's Education Coordinator, Dr. Jennifer Cox, is responsible for developing and monitoring teaching programs for medical students and residents. Dr. Patrick Leavey, the Director of the Hematology-Oncology Fellowship Program, oversees the entire array of educational activities for the fellows. Fifty-eight individuals have successfully completed the Hematology-Oncology Fellowship Program, initiated in 1984, with eleven enrolled in 2010. Continued development of this program, with the aim of training future national leaders in pediatric hematology-oncology, is a high priority for the division. The training program is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and has been supported financially by Children's, the Children's Cancer Fund, Wipe Out Kids' Cancer, St. Baldrick's Foundation, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, Amgen and an NIH T32 institutional training grant. The fellowship program has developed a Web site, an informative venue for prospective applicants as well as others, that describes resources, facilities, patient populations, faculty research areas and program goals and accomplishments. Teaching conferences are held from several times each week to monthly, including Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Grand Rounds, Oncology Tumor Board, Neuro-oncology Tumor Board, Hematology Case Conference, Journal Club and team meetings of each of the disease-oriented sub-programs within the division. Numerous Hematology-Oncology faculty members are recipients of teaching awards. For the past twelve years the division has offered an annual Continuing Medical Education course each October at UT Southwestern aimed at primary care physicians. Between 50 and 70 attendees participate regularly and provide uniformly positive reviews.

Over the past decade, the number of hospitalists, and hospitals using hospitalists, has grown rapidly making it one of the fastest growing specialties in pediatrics. The Pediatric Hospital Medicine program at Children's Medical Center has shown similar growth. Originating in 2002 as a single service line with five UT Southwestern pediatric faculty members, the program has grown to twenty-six faculty members, covering up to eight service lines at Children's Medical Center Dallas and Children's Medical Center at Legacy. It is among the largest and clinically busiest in the nation. The group focuses on four particular areas: patient care, medical education, clinical research, and advocacy. Faculty Vijay Kalidindi, M.D., Associate Professor of Pediatrics at UT Southwestern is the Program Director for Hospital Medicine at Children's.

There are two types of services staffed during the year at the Dallas campus. The first relies on 24-hour, 7 days a week, on-site attending coverage. The second resembles a prototypical teaching service with several levels of learners, including medical students and pediatric resident physicians. In 2008, Children's at Legacy opened in the suburb of Plano, Texas, and the 24/7 on-site attending model is utilized there. Since patient census varies seasonally, the number of hospitalist services change throughout the year. New developments in our program include creation of a short stay unit staffed 24/7 exclusively by hospitalists. There are five hospitalist services (three at Dallas and two at Legacy) and one teaching service during the summer months. During the peak winter months, which represents coverage of over 100 patient beds a day, there are up to seven hospitalist services (five at Dallas and two at Legacy) and one teaching service. Faculty encounter a wide range of medical conditions with varying complexity and provide the highest quality of care for patients through evidence-based practice and family-centered care. An asthma care unit was implemented in 2009, and plans include creation of a subspecialty hospitalist service where the subspecialist is the consultant and hospitalist the attending physician. Medical Education In addition to their clinical duties, Hospitalist Medicine faculty members actively participate in the educational programs of UT Southwestern and Children's. All hospitalists hold faculty appointments at UT Southwestern Medical School and are expected to create novel educational opportunities for our students and residents. Faculty teach residents from UT Southwestern's categorical residency program, family practice interns from local programs (John Peter Smith, Baylor Garland, Charlton Methodist and UTSW), and third year medical students from UT Southwestern Medical School and trainees from outside programs doing elective rotations. Hospitalist faculty participate in nursing education as well. A hospitalist elective is available for our resident physicians. Several hospitalists participate in the intern recruitment and other activities include resident morning reports and advocacy programs. Division faculty had poster presentations in national meetings and several lectures to faculty, residents , students, and physician extenders, including nurse practitioners. Research Activities Hospitalist Medicine faculty members develop one or more areas of expertise related to their clinical interests and have engaged in a number of research endeavors, some collaborative with other disciplines. Faculty members have 122Hospitalist Medicinepartnered with colleagues in Orthopedics to standardize the approach to management of bone and joint infections, with the purpose of reducing morbidity and length of in-patient stays. Hospitalist in-patient service also serves as a site for implementation of family-centered rounds, an innovative approach that prospectively and directly incorporates parents and patients into the discussion of their medical issues and the formulation of management plans. Hospitalists participate in several quality initiatives pertaining to inpatient care including patient discharges, and are in process of developing several evidence-based, computer-based order sets and pathways. Some of the faulty members' research interests include quality initiatives, bone infections, electronic medical record, information technology and evidence based practice. Hospitalist accomplishments include publications and presentations at national meetings. Advocacy Hospitalists participate in a number of hospital committees in order to improve both the efficiency of the hospital and the care of patients. Hospitalist faculty have a presence in regional and national organizations such as Texas Medical Association, Texas Pediatric Society, American Academy of Pediatrics and Society of Hospitalist Medicine where they advocate for the health of our children.

Division faculty direct the infection control program at Children's and manage an active ambulatory service for children with infectious diseases, including a large clinic for HIV-infected and HIV-exposed children and adolescents. In these clinics, fellows, residents and medical students are trained in the management of complicated infectious diseases in pediatrics. This clinical training is in the form of consultations, rounds, conferences and outpatient infectious disease and HIV clinics. Since 1965, 96 physicians from 23 different countries have completed training in the division's fellowship training program and approximately 75 percent of these individuals have academic appointments at universities and children's hospitals worldwide. Many graduates of the program are chairs or directors of academic programs. Faculty in Pediatric Infectious Disease also has been actively engaged in clinically applied research for more than 40 years. Results of their clinical- and laboratory-based research are presented at many forums nationally and internationally. The faculty is recognized worldwide as leaders in many areas of infectious diseases and as principal investigators of domestic and international collaborative research projects. The research efforts of the division are supported by a wide variety of sources including the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID), the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and several foundations, as well as through grants and contracts from the pharmaceutical industry. As a consultative service, faculty and fellows in Pediatric Infectious Disease interact with all divisions in the department and assist in the management of children with a variety of underlying medical problems. Faculty Jeffrey Kahn, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Pediatrics and Microbiology, is Director of the Pediatric Infectious Disease program and holds the Sarah M. and Charles E. Seay Chair in Pediatric Infectious Diseases. He was recruited from Yale University in May 2009 where he studied newly discovered human viruses. Dr. Kahn's laboratory was the first group in the United States to report the clinical features, epidemiology and genetic features of human metapneumovirus, human coronavirus HKU1 and NL63, and human bocavirus. These new viruses are associated with upper and lower respiratory tract disease in infants and young children. Dr. Kahn earned his B.S. at McGill University, Montreal, PQ, Canada, in 1982 and his M.D. and Ph.D. degrees from State University of New York, Health Science Center at Brooklyn in 1991. His Ph.D. in Microbiology focused on the molecular biology of vaccinia virus, the virus used in the smallpox vaccine. He performed his internship and residency in Pediatrics at Yale-New Haven Hospital in Connecticut from 1991 to 1994 and served as Chief Resident of Pediatrics at the newly opened Children's Hospital at Yale-New Haven. Dr. Kahn completed his Pediatric Infectious Disease Fellowship at Yale University from 1995-1998, after which he joined the faculty at Yale. Among his accomplishments, Dr. Kahn received distinguished research, clinical and teaching awards at Yale and has received research funding from the National Institutes of Health, the American Lung Association, and the American Heart Association, among others.

All fellows participate in research projects with the faculty. Dr. Garcia works with viral respiratory tract infections in young children, particularly RSV and rhinoviruses. She studies the clinical characteristics, disease severity, and differences in host immune-response. Dr. Garcia's work has been supported by the MedImmune Fellowship Grant Award for research in respiratory viruses. Clinical Activities Consultations in the pediatric and neonatal intensive care units at Parkland and Children's (both Dallas and Legacy campuses) involve patients with inherited or acquired immunodeficiency, including patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy for cancer, organ transplantation, bone marrow and stem cell transplantation; inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatologic disorders; and infants and children with a wide variety of classic as well as unusual infectious disease problems. The division is responsible for an active infectious disease ambulatory clinic at Children's, where follow-up care is provided to children with complicated infections who were initially managed as in-patients and to those who have been referred to the clinic by practicing physicians in the community. The division also manages approximately 120 HIV-infected children and adolescents as well as an additional group of infants and young children with perinatal HIV exposure. Dr. Carla Garcia joined the International Adoption Medicine Clinic to open at the Children's Medical Center at Legacy campus. Presentations/Teaching Activities While in the Pediatric Infectious Disease fellowship program, t r a i n e e s a r e p r o v i d e d a b a c k g r o u n d i n l a b o r a t o r y t e c h n i q u e s of classical microbiology, immunology and molecular biology; experience in application of the scientific method to clinical and laboratory research; and an opportunity to develop competence in diagnosis and management of infectious diseases. Third- and fourth-year medical students and pediatric residents can elect to work in the general Infectious Disease inpatient se rvi ce, o r th e HIV / AID S clini c Durin g this r o ta ti o n , train ees gain experience with diagnosis and management of infections in neonates, infants and children, familiarity with the rationale for selection of antimicrobial agents, and insight into issues related to infection-control practices in hospitalized patients. The rotation in the HIV clinic offers experience in management of children and adolescents with HIV infection, as well as prophylaxis and testing of infants born to HIV positive mothers. At a weekly Wednesday morning Infectious Disease Conference, lectures and open discussions are held in which infectious disease topics are presented and discussed. Fellows present their work-in-progress reports at least twice each year at Journal Club, where cases on the clinical service are thoroughly discussed. In addition, the faculty members participate actively in the teaching of students, residents and fellows through lectures in the annual Department of Microbiology course; formal and informal discussions with students, residents, fellows and visitors during daily rounds; lectures to students and residents at many noon conferences at Children's each year, including the monthly \"Bugs Among Us\" lecture; inpatient consultation and ambulatory clinic service in ARCH; and talks at the annual Children's-sponsored Haltalin Seminar. 1st Annual Senior Fellows Research Day Graduating fellow Michael Chang explains his research to Dr. William Scott, Pediatric Cardiology Division Director. 129Infectious DiseaseThe UT Southwestern Clinical Fellowship in South Africa provides an educational and enlightening medical experience for participants.

The division is also responsible for high-quality academic programs that enjoy substantial extramural funding and publication record, as well as excellence in teaching at the divisional, departmental and university levels. Neonatal-Perinatal faculty continue to be invited nationally and internationally to present and serve on committees to advance neonatal care. The division coordinates integrated neonatal care across the UT Southwestern, Parkland and Children's campuses, including more than 15,000 deliveries annually at Parkland Health & Hospital System, of which 1,300 are admitted to the 90-bed NICU at Parkland. The 36-bed referral NICU at Children's is geared to take care of infants with complex medical and surgical problems, and those with special metabolic, cardiac, or surgical conditions who are transferred from other hospitals for a higher level of care. Working closely with Maternal-Fetal Medicine and other pediatric subspecialties, the division coordinates the Fetal Evaluation and Treatment Alliance (FETAL) Program that provides multidisciplinary antenatal consultation, advanced imaging, fetal intervention and delivery planning for referrals from North Texas and beyond. The Resuscitation Team in Labor and Delivery is an internationally acclaimed program providing state-of-the-art assistance to newborn infants as they transition to extra-uterine life. In addition, the Low Birth Weight Clinic follows infants born severely prematurely and those that have had chronic neonatal disorders to ensure appropriate growth and development up to age three. The wealth of patients under the care of the division affords a high level of academic and scholarly activity. Medical student, resident and fellow education programs provide teaching of clinical skills, as well as experience in basic and/ or clinical research. Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine includes basic science projects and neonatal translational and clinical projects, as well as large collaborative clinical projects conducted by the Neonatal Research Network, the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Network, and the role of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in hearing loss and developmental disability, all sponsored by the NIH. In 2010, the division has grown with the addition of Drs. Arlene Davis, Julie Mirpuri, Emily Osier, and Muraleedharan Sivarajan to the faculty. We were sorry to lose Drs. Donald McCurnin and Rodica Catrinel Marinescu who moved to other cities for family reasons. Faculty Rashmin Savani, M.B.,Ch.B., Professor, is Director of Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine at UT Southwestern and holds the William Buchanan Chair in Pediatrics. He is also the Associate Director of Pulmonary and Vascular Biology in the Department of Pediatrics. Dr. Savani obtained his medical degree from the University of Sheffield, England, in 1982 and undertook internships in internal medicine, general surgery, and obstetr ics and gynecology from 1982 to 1984. He was a pediatric resident at Duke University Medical Center, Durham, N.C., from 1984 to 1987 and held fellowships at Cincinnati Children's Medical Center in Neonatology from 1987 to 1989 and in Pulmonary Biology from 1989 to 1991. Dr. Savani was an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics in the Section of Neonatology at the University of Manitoba and Children's Hospital, Winnipeg, Canada, from 1991 to 1996. During this time, he undertook further postgraduate training in Cell and Molecular Biology at the Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology from 1991 to 1994; then had an independent lab at the Institute until he was recruited to the University of Pennsylvania and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in 1996. There he rose to the rank of Associate Professor with Tenure in 2002, a position he held until 2006 when he was recruited to UT Southwestern. Dr. Savani's clinical expertise is in the areas of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, surfactant and pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, and his research focus has been on lung injury and development, including inflammation and angiogenesis. His laboratory is studying the role of hyaluronic acid (HA) and its receptors in a variety of models of tissue injury, in particular the response to lung injury.

Basic science projects are focused on cellular and molecular regulation of nitric oxide and other vasodilators, endothelial cell biology with respect to cardiovascular and pulmonary development and disease, mechanisms regulating uteroplacental blood flow in pregnancy, mechanisms regulating blood pressure before and after birth, pathogenesis of inflammation and lung injury in animal models, and extracellular matrix regulation of cell migration and proliferation. Translational projects include animal models of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, genetic surfactant deficiency, and neonatal resuscitation. Clinical research projects include studies conducted through the collaborative projects conducted by the Neonatal Research Network consisting of 18 institutions in North America, sponsored by National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). The division has been a participating member of this network since its 140Neonatal-Perinatal Medicineinception in 1986 and successfully competed for the next cycle in 2010. Other national collaborative studies include the role of CMV infection in hearing loss and strategies to prevent this long-term disability. General neonatal projects include the natural history and diagnosis of patent ductus arteriosus, optimization of resuscitation and stabilization of the newborn in the delivery room including temperature stabilization, oxygen use and cardiac compressions, the effect of gentamicin on hypocalcaemia in the newborn, role of glucocorticoids and vasopressors in the regulation of blood pressure in very low birth weight neonates, approaches to treatment and prevention of infection in the newborn, the effects of very low birth weight on blood pressure regulation at 1 to 3 years, complications of late preterm infants, and studies of the recognition and prevention of hyperbilirubinemia in neonates. Clinical projects in the division are facilitated by the comprehensive databases that are maintained in each area of the division ' s activities including resuscitation, NBN, both NICUs as well as the Follow Up Clinic. In addition, the division and its partner hospitals are members of the Vermont Oxford Network and the Children's Hospitals' Neonatal Database collaboratives. Research funding exceeded $1.75 million for the fiscal year. There are more than eight NIH-supported grants within the division, one which has been continuously funded for more than 30 years. Other sources of funding include an endowed chair and two professorships awarded by UT Southwestern, as well as smaller foundation and pharmaceutical company research grants. Clinical Activities Parkland Memorial Hospital Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine faculty participated in the care of more than 1,300 neonates admitted to the NICU, as well as an additional 14,000 neonates admitted to the NBN at Parkland. Continued close collaboration with the faculty and fellows in the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Division in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology ensures optimal delivery plans for at-risk pregnancies. Despite this high-risk delivery service, adjusted neonatal mortality remains less than four per 1,000 live births and outcomes compare extremely favorably to benchmark institutions nationwide. Faculty, fellows, advanced practice nurses (APN) and residents provide integrated neonatal care at three levels of acuity in a 90-bed NICU. The Resuscitation Program, directed by Dr. Myra Wyckoff, provides a coordinated multidisciplinary team attendance at high-risk deliveries. Comprehensive electronic databases have been actively in use for more than 25 years for the NICU and for over fifteen years in the Resuscitation Program. Children's Medical Center After opening the 36-bed NICU in Tower D at Children's, we have seen continued growth in admissions to this unit. The quality of the program was recognized by Optum Health (part of United Healthcare), awarding the unit the \"Center of Excellence\" designation, one of only 61 NICUs in the US given this designation, and the only one in Dallas. This unit has bolstered the strengths of the campus program in Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine, and has seen referrals from within the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex and throughout North Texas and beyond. The unit cares for infants with complex medical and surgical problems, and those with special metabolic, cardiac or surgical conditions transferred from other hospitals for a higher level of care. The mortality for these extremely sick infants is less than 6 percent. Continued growth is anticipated, and neonatologists, neonatal nursing and APN recruitment is ongoing. An electronic database has already been established for the NICU at Children's. The division continues its involvement with the Children's Hospitals Neonatal Database. Division faculty coordinate Integrated Fetal and Neonatal Care across the UT Southwestern, Children's and Parkland campuses. 141Neonatal-Perinatal MedicineLow Birth Weight Clinic and Follow-up Program The division also participates in the Low Birth Weight Clinic located at Children's, a part of the ARCH (At Risk Children) Center, generously funded through the Crystal Charity Ball. Babies who were severely premature (<1500 gm birth weight), or who had specific chronic neonatal disorders of the brain, lungs, or intestines, can be followed through this clinic. The clinic was started in 1979 by Elizabeth Heyne, PA-C, and Dr. Roy Heyne agreed to provide physician backup on a volunteer basis. He now serves as the Medical Director of the Low Birth Weight Clinic, which sees an average of 550 to 600 patients each year, 170 of those being new patients. Each one is followed by the clinic for the first three years of life, through the ea rly stages of chronic diseases and neurodevelopment. Dr. Roy Heyne, advanced practitioners, and other healthcare professionals provide comprehensive medical and psychosocial treatment through intensive intervention, education, social services, and developmental testing for these potentially vulnerable babies. An electronic database of these patients has been in existence for more than 10 years and this program is integral to the NICHD Neonatal Network. Presentations/Teaching Activities Division faculty play prominent roles in the educational activities within the School of Medicine, the Department of Pediatrics, the Division of Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine, and Maternal-Fetal Medicine in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. The goals of these programs are to facilitate the understanding of the problems associated with normal and high-risk pregnancies and to prepare trainees for careers in General Pediatrics, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Maternal-Fetal Medicine and Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine. Teaching within multiple programs at UT Southwestern Medical School includes \"Introduction to Clinical Medicine,\" a sophomore medical student course, the introductory course on \"Human Biology and Disease\" in the Integrative Biology Graduate Program, and the \"Clinical Pathology Lecture Series\" for residents in the Department of Pathology. Under the supervision of faculty with expertise in resuscit ation, third-year pediatric residents are assigned to the Resuscitation Team in Labor and Delivery, where they are recertified in the Neonatal Resuscitation Program, participate in the care of term newborns, and assist in the triage and initial care of sick term and premature neonates. The first- and second-year residents are directly involved in the daily care of preterm and term infants in the Parkland NICU. The goals of these experiences are to provide residents the opportunity to acquire skills in resuscitation and stabilization of the newborn, recognition of the sick neonate, a common requirement of the general pediatrician outside major urban areas, and how to provide the initial care of the sick and preterm neonate prior to transfer to a tertiary care facility. The fellowship training program in Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine was developed by Dr. Charles Rosenfeld using guidelines of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Board of Pediatrics (ABP), and the Organization of Neonatal-Perinatal Training Program Directors. Fully accredited through 2013 by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), the three-year training program in Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine, now under the direction of Dr. Luc Brion, Program Director, has continued to flourish. Trainees in this program not only improve their skills as clinicians and teachers, but also develop their experience in basic and clinical research. Half of the 49 program graduates since 1980 chose a career in academic neonatology and half are in clinical practice, both in the United States and abroad. To date, 95 percent of graduates have published at least one manuscript from their research work during this fellowship, and fellows have enjoyed a 95 percent success rate on the American Board of Pediatrics' Neonatal-Perinatal sub-board examination. As noted above, six of the fellows successfully competed for grant awards in 2010.

The Nephrology inpatient and outpatient services, comprised of physicians, nurses and staff, are dedicated to the treatment of children with these diseases. Specializing in all areas of renal-related diseases, including inherited renal disorders, chronic kidney disease, urinary tract infections, hypertension, tubular abnormalities, renal tubular acidosis and metabolic bone disease, Nephrology offers outstanding services and equipment that enables the division to provide state-of-the-art care. The physicians provide care to patients with end stage renal disease, and it is one of the largest pediatric hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and transplant programs in the United States. There are usually six Nephrology fellows in training at a time, each being mentored in both clinical nephrology and either basic or clinical research. Several of the fellows have been presented the Research Award given by the American Society of Pediatric Nephrology, and some are trainees of an NIH-funded training grant, one of the very few in the country. In 2010, 2nd-year fellow Matthias Wolf, M.D., was awarded a Pediatric Scientist Development Program grant, a competitive grant awarded to only 5-7 pediatricians annually. All fellows have a first-author manuscript in a leading journal by the completion of their fellowship, and most graduating trainees continue productive careers in academic medicine. The research productivity of the Nephrology division is outstanding. Members of the division publish both clinical and basic research manuscripts in the most prestigious Nephrology journals. Division faculty have been continuously funded by the NIH for more than 20 years. Dr. Michel Baum is the Editor of Pediatric Nephrology, the journal of the International Society of Pediatric Nephrology. Members of the division are on editorial boards of Pediatric Nephrology, the American Journal of Physiology, and the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology. Faculty Michel G. Baum, M.D. is Professor and Director of the Pediatric Nephrology Division. He holds the Sarah M. and Charles E. Seay Chair in Pediatric Research. Dr. Baum's clinical expertise is in chronic kidney disease, dialysis, nephrotic syndrome, renal transplantation, tubular disorders and renal tubular acidosis. His research interests are centered on epithelial transport, renal development, and tubular disorders. Recent areas of study involve maturation of the Na+/H+ exchanger in the proximal tubule, fibroblast growth factor-23 and its role in phosphate wasting diseases, X-linked hyposphatemia and the prenatal programming of adult hypertension. Dr. Baum graduated summa cum laude from the University of California at Los Angeles with a Bachelor of Science degree in biochemistry in 197 4. He received his medical degree from UCLA in 1978 and performed his pediatric residency at Yale-New Haven Hospital from 1978 to 1981. He performed fellowships at the Children's Renal Center, University of California at San Francisco, in Pediatric Nephrology from 1981 to 1982, and at the Cardiovascular Institute, University of California at San Francisco, in Nephrology and Renal Physiology from 1982 to 1984.

The kidney starts developing at 10 weeks gestation, and the full complement of nephrons is achieved at 35 weeks gestation. A healthy child is born with one million kidney units called nephrons in each kidney. However, there are diseases of the kidney that occur because of insults that happen in utero or because of inherited diseases of the kidney that result in mild to severe renal disease. The faculty works to determine how prenatal insults result in kidney disease and hypertension in later life. They also examine inherited diseases that affect kidney development such as autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease. Even if the kidney develops normally, it can be injured by nephrotoxic drugs or an interruption in the blood supply to the kidney that leads to acute kidney injury. The prognosis for acute kidney injury has not improved significantly over the past two decades and acute kidney injury is a major cause of chronic kidney disease. Investigators are examining how hormones such as FGF-23 and Klotho affect renal electrolyte homeostasis, vitamin D levels and cause bone disease. They are examining novel treatments to improve the outcome of acute kidney injury using bone marrow stem cells. Sometimes renal disease causes permanent loss of kidney function and requires extensive therapy such as dialysis. The division conducts clinical studies examining how to improve the lives of children on dialysis and improve the likelihood that a kidney transplant will be successful. Finally, there is a connection between kidney disease and debilitating bone disease. Investigators have taken basic discoveries made at the bench to clinical studies in patients with bone disease. Funding for research is provided by the NIH, the American Heart Association and Children's. Clinical Activities The Nephrology division at UT Southwestern is one the largest programs in the United States for the treatment of children with end stage renal disease, and the primary healthcare provider for children with end stage renal disease in North Texas. The hemodialysis unit, at which outpatient hemodialysis is performed six days a week, is a child-friendly environment that provides laptop computers to children while they are being dialyzed. The peritoneal dialysis p r o g r a m i s s t a ff e d b y d e v o t e d p h y s i c i a n s a n d n u r s e s d e d i c a t e d t o t h e f a m i l i e s t r e a t i n g c h i l d r e n w i t h o u t p a t i e n t peritoneal dialysis. There is an average of 30 hemodialysis patients and 34 patients treated with home peritoneal dialysis annually. There were 27 renal transplants performed per year making ours one of the largest programs in the country. The inpatient Pediatric Nephrology Service has a mean census of 11 patients, with all patients treated on the same floor by nurses and physicians who are dedicated to the treatment of renal disease and hypertension. As the sole renal consultants for the intensive care services at Children's, the division performed an average of 16 acute hemodialysis treatments, 52 acute peritoneal dialysis treatments and 41 continuous venovenous hemofiltration procedures per month last year. 150NephrologyDr. Baum, along with Drs. Raymond Quigley, Mouin Seikaly, Amy Becker, Jyothsna Gattineni, Fangming Lin, and Katherine Twombley provided the inpatient attending responsibility for the Pediatric Nephrology service over the previous 12 months. In addition to responsibility for providing consults at Children's and Parkland Memorial Hospital, with an average of 21 consults per month, the inpatient attending provides the majority of teaching for students, residents, and fellows during the month they are on service. The Pediatric Nephrology Clinic at Children's Dallas is now in operation Monday through Friday, and clinics have been initiated at Children's at Legacy. In addition to the clinical responsibilities at Children's, doctors see patients at Texas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children, where Dr. Seikaly is the Director of the Metabolic Bone Clinic. During 2009 - 2010 there was a monthly average of about 450 outpatients. Over the next year, plans include expanding outpatient services to accommodate patients and the private physicians in Dallas. Presentations/Teaching Activities The division of nephrology provides teaching to medical students, interns, residents and fellows. We provide didactic discussions in formal conferences at Children's and at the Medical School. Nephrology rounds are accompanied by teaching with every patient and a formal discussion of a topic. We also participate in teaching of internal medicine and pediatric nephrology fellows at UT Southwestern.

Formed in the 1980s as part of the Department of Neurology, the division maintained a successful academic and training program through the 1990s. Dr. Susan Iannaccone became Division Chief in 2004, and the division joined the Department of Pediatrics in 2006. The faculty represents a mix of young and mature individuals, each of whom brings special talents and experience that promise to contribute to further growth and development of the division. Additional faculty are being recruited to join the team. The national shortage of pediatric neurologists has been deemed a crisis by both the American Academy of Neurology and the Child Neurology Society. For this reason, a high priority for the division is to maintain a competitive Pediatric Neurology (PN) Training Program that will help supply high-quality faculty for many years to come. PN residents complete two years of pediatric residency before entering the program. The PN training is three years in duration and includes one full year of Adult Neurology. Beginning in 2009, the Department of Pediatrics offered medical students an opportunity for five years of training so that they can complete both their Pediatric and PN training at UT Southwestern. There are nine PN residents, three per year. Each sees his/her own patients in their weekly PN Continuity Clinic (CC); there are two CCs per week, each staffed by two faculty. In 2009 the PN Training Program, under the direction of Dr. Rana Said, achieved full accreditation from the ABPN for five years, a rare and excellent tribute to the hard work of all involved in the program. An integrated six-year program is available for training in Pediatric Neurodevelopment (PND). One candidate is accepted every other year for this program. Fellowship training for PN sub-specialties is available in the division for epilepsy and neuromuscular medicine. This training is available for one year after completion of the PN residency but in some cases may be extended for two years in order to include a year of research. Each resident completes a research project and presents at one or more national meetings during their 3 year training. Each year, the division, in collaboration with the Department of Neurology, Children's and the Muscular Dystrophy Association, presents the Carrell-Krusen Neuromuscular Symposium. Dr. Iannaccone is the Program Director for this meeting and most residents and fellows from the division and from the Department of Neurology participate by presenting at the symposium. The division is committed to providing high-quality care in an appropriate timeframe and to utilizing resources efficiently. Thus, referrals to the PN Clinic are reviewed weekly to determine the appropriateness of the referral and to ensure that the neurologist receives supporting records and documentation. Attending neurologists are available 24/7 to answer any questions regarding referrals and to provide guidance to general practitioners and pediatricians. Faculty Susan T. Iannaccone, M.D., Professor, is the Jimmy Elizabeth Westcott Distinguished Chair in Pediatric Neurology and Director of the Pediatric Neurology program at UT Southwestern. Dr. Iannaccone's clinical interests are focused on neuromuscular medicine and neurorehabilitation. Her research includes clinical trials in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and spinal muscular atrophy. She was Principal Investigator for American Spinal Muscular Atrophy Randomized Trials (AmSMART), 2000 to 2008, with funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Current projects include a Phase II clinical trial of PTC124 (ataluren) in DMD and establishment of a registry for heredity neuropathy. Dr. Iannaccone received her medical degree from State University of New York Health Science Center, Syracuse, in 1969. She performed her residency training in pediatrics at the State University of New York Upstate Medical University Hospital, Syracuse, from 1969 to 1971 and at St. Louis Children's Hospital, Washington University, from 1971 to 1972. She was a resident in the neurology department of Strong Memorial Hospital, University of Rochester, New York, from 1972 to 1975. Susan T.

Current studies are focused in five areas: metabolic disorders of the nervous system, neuromuscular disease clinical trials, anti-epileptic drug trials, clinical trials in pediatric stroke and clinical studies in the autism spectrum. Research funding from a variety of sources, including the NIH, exceeded $400,000 in 2010. Faculty present results of their work at many national and international meetings and published 13 articles in peer- reviewed journals in 2010. Dr. Iannaccone is the Site Principal Investigator for a Phase II Efficacy and Safety Study of PTC124 in subjects with nonsense-mutation-mediated Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy. DMD is a disabling and life-threatening X-linked genetic disorder affecting young boys. Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is a phenotypically milder form of the dystrophic muscle disease. Boys with DMD/BMD develop progressive proximal muscle weakness that leads to deterioration of ambulation, wheelchair dependency, and eventual respiratory and cardiac failure. There is no cure for DMD/ BMD. Dr. Iannaccone is the site director for the Charcot-Marie Tooth (CMT) Center of Excellence grant for the Charcot-Marie Disease (hereditary progressive peripheral neuropathies). Dr. Michael Dowling serves as Site Co-investigator for a study called \"Validation of the NIH Stroke Scale in Children.\" Stroke affects approximately 3.3 per 100,000 children under age 18 every year in Europe and North America, and ranks among the top 10 causes of death in childhood. Long-term motor and cognitive deficits that interfere with activities of daily life and academic attainment affect 40 to 60 percent of survivors of childhood stroke. The public health significance of these problems is magnified when consid ering that children live with the sequelae of stroke for the duration of their childhood and throughout their adult lives. Despite the magnitude of the public health impact of childhood stroke, there are no proven or widely accepted strategies for acute management or prevention of childhood stroke, other than blood transfusion for children with sickle cell anemia. Uncertainty regarding treatment of children wi th s tr o k e d e ri v es fr o m th e l a c k o f c lini cal tri als o f s tr o k e in t e rv e n ti o n s in c hil dr e n , as w e ll as th e limi t ed da ta available from existing cohort studies regarding the factors that determine outcome. Progress in defining factors that determine outcome has been hindered by the lack of a validated clinical stroke scale for children. The NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is a quantitative measure of stroke-related neurologic deficit that has proven intra- and interrater reliability, and has predictive validity for stroke outcome. Consequently, the NIHSS is employed in nearly every current acute stroke study in the United States as a measure of the initial and final n e ur o l o gi cal d e fi c i t. H o w ev e r , c hil dr e n w e r e e xp r ess l y e x c l u d e d fr o m p ri o r v ali da ti o n s tu di es o f th e NIH SS. Thi s study will address these gaps by evaluating a pediatric modification of the NIHSS that will describe and quantify the severity of acute neurologic deficit as well as test its validity and reliability. This study began enrolling patients in early 2006, and UT Southwestern leads in enrollment in this international multicenter study. Dr. Susan Arnold serves as Principal Investigator of a study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Perampanel given as adjunctive therapy in patients with refractory partial seizures as well as serving as PI for the study of Clobazam in patients with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. Drs. Saadat Khan and Rana Said serve as Co-Investigators on the two studies along with Dr. Arnold. Dr. Rana Said serves as Principal Investigator of a retrospective study of the efficacy and safety of high dose Levetiracetam in a pediatric population with a variety of seizure disorders. Dr. Juan M. Pascual participated in nine funded research studies: t\u0001A major investigator-initiated grant from the National Institutes of Health titled \"Modulation of brain activity by control of the inspired air\" (as Co-Investigator) studying human cerebral oxygen consumption and electrical (EEG) activity changes under CO2, a component of breathing air that has vasodilatory properties and mediates the action of some drugs used to treat epilepsy. t\u0001A contract from the National Institutes of Health, Office of Rare Disorders titled \"Glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome (GD) collaboration, education and test translation (CETT) program at UT Southwestern Medical Center and Childrens Medical Center\" (as Principal Investigator). This program has positioned our group as the sole provider of comprehensive clinical and genetic diagnosis and care for this genetic disorder that causes epilepsy and developmental delay. t\u0001A grant from the National Institutes of Health sponsored by the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act titled \"Genotype and metabolic phenotype in glioblastoma\" (as Co-Investigator). This challenge grant represents the expansion of novel MRI methodology and the additional development of MRI methods for the study of the human brain to search for metabolic alterations in cancer that can become predictors of disease severity and help identify therapeutic targets. t\u0001A second American Reinvestment and Recovery Act grant from the National Institutes of Health titled \"Developing a North American mitochondrial diseases consortium (NAMDC)\" (as Co-Investigator and Site Principal Investigator). This 11-institution infrastructural grant constitutes the first initiative worldwide to 158Neurologyrecruit and characterize a broad range of mitochondrial disease patients to facilitate clinical trials across the U.S. and Canada aimed to treat these frequent but still incurable disorders. t\u0001A National Institutes of Health / UT Southwestern Medical Center pilot grant titled \"Diagnostic signatures of metabolic diseases by high-field NMR spectroscopy\" (as Pilot Award Recipient PI and Co-Investigator of the institutional award). This project helped develop skeletal (leg) muscle MRI spectroscopy, a non-invasive methodology that is available at most institutions that perform MRIs. These studies will help us understand mechanisms of energy failure in muscle and brain disorders, improve the diagnosis of several metabolic disorders and identify potential biomarkers (disease indicators) for clinical trials. t\u0001A National Institutes of Health training grant titled \"Epilepsy in primary cerebral energy failure\" (as Sponsor to a Ph.D. postdoctoral fellow trainee). The goal of the proposed research plan is to understand, as quantitatively as possible, the dependence of brain excitability on brain energy metabolism by studying both the normal and a prototypic disease state. t\u0001A Billingsley Fund/ Dallas Women's Foundation grant devoted to study \"Childhood brain metabolism: function relationships\" (as Principal Investigator). This gift was established to support research on childhood epilepsies that arise from cerebral glucose (fuel) use deficits. t\u0001An International European Union Postdoctoral Fellowship titled \"Studies of Brain Metabolism in Epilepsy\" (as Mentor to Postdoctoral Fellowship Recipient). This competitive fellowship was awarded based on the merits of the applicant, mentor and research project proposal to support salary, fringe and small expenses of a current postdoctoral fellow who will spend two years with us in the U.S. t\u0001A National Institutes of Health grant titled \"Quantitative Assessment of Spinal Cord Blood Volume with MRI\" (as Co-Investigator) which will develop a new approach to study blood supply in the spinal cord. Clinical Activities The expertise of the faculty is focused on several sub-specialties: comprehensive epilepsy management including seizure surgery; neuromuscular medicine clinics including myasthenia gravis, muscular dystrophy, Charcot Marie Tooth and transitional care for disease; neonatal intensive neurocognitive delay, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder/learning disabilities (ADHD/LD) and traumatic brain injury. Neurodevelopmental Disabilities Program As the Neurodevelopmental Disabilities Program (NDD) concludes its third year at UT Southwestern, the program continues to experience significant growth specifically with regard to clinical opportunities, research, education, and community outreach. NDD clinics are multi-disciplinary in structure and are specifically created to serve children with autism, developmental delay, traumatic brain injuries and ADHD/LD issues. The program will expand to provide full-time NDD services to both the Dallas and Legacy campuses beginning in July 2010. Plans are now underway to build an NDD-dedicated space at the Legacy campus to open in 2011. From an education standpoint, in the year since it was created and ACGME accredited, the NDD program has trained its first fellow, Dr. Sailaja Golla. Dr. Golla finished her child neurology training at UT Southwestern, where she also served as chief resident, and recently published in Journal of Clinical Neuromuscular Disease. She brings a wealth of experience as well as solid research and clinical skills, and, started as assistant professor of neurology and pediatrics in July 2010. The NDD team continues to work diligently to serve the North Texas community at large. The team attends special needs children on site at the Dallas-based Autistic Treatment Center on a quarterly basis, and works closely with Dr. Carolyn Garver and her outstanding team of specialists. Drs. Evans and Morris both continue to speak throughout the metroplex in various educational settings, including the Dallas ISD, the Dallas Theological Seminary, and other specialty programs regarding children with special needs. 159Neurology The inpatient Neurology service includes two teams: the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit and the C7/Consult Team. Both provide 24/7 coverage for patient units and in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and the emergency department. The Epilepsy Monitoring unit provides six beds and performed more than 500 procedures; the C10/Consult Team provides eight beds. Both teams include an attending and support staff; the C7/Consult Team includes at least one PN resident and several third-year medical students on their required Neurology rotation plus rotating residents from Adult Neurology, Psychiatry or other specialties.Clinic Directors Dallas Campus:Adolescent Clinic Susan Iannaccone, M.D.Attention and Learning Disorders Patricia Evans, M.D.Autistic Spectrum Disorders Patricia Evans, M.D.Brachial Plexus Clinic William Zinser, M.D. Jonathan Cheng, M.D.Charcot-Marie Tooth Clinic (Center of Excellence) Susan Iannaccone, M.D.Cognitive Development Clinic Patricia Evans, M.D.Comprehensive Epilepsy Clinics Susan Arnold, M.D.Comprehensive Pediatric Stroke Clinic Michael Dowling, M.D., P.D., M.S.C.S.Epilepsy Surgery Clinic Susan Arnold, M.D. Rana Said, M.D.Headache Clinic Jose Aceves, M.D.Ketogenic Continuity M.D.Rare Disorders Clinic Pascual, M.D., Ph.D.Rett Syndrome/Angelman Clinic M.D.Zero-2-3 Neurodevelopment Clinic William Zinser Legacy Campus: Attention and Learning Disorder Patricia Evans, M.D.Autistic Spectrum Disorder Patricia Evans, M.D.Epilepsy Susan Arnold, M.D. Saadat Khan, M.D. Deepa Sirsi, M.D. Patient Visits Attending Providers / PNPs 1,898Total Visits 9,630 160NeurologyPresentations/Teaching Activities Dr. Rana Said, Program Director for the PN residency and clerkship, with the assistance of Program Coordinator Kellie Shaw, leads the teaching program that educates residents and medical students for inpatient and outpatient rotations.

It is an exclusively research-driven division in the Department of Pediatrics, thereby representing a novel concept that amplifies the efforts and effectiveness of pediatric faculty and trainees alike. In addition, Pulmonary and Vascular Biology has provided a valuable resource for campus-wide investigative endeavors. This is represented by active collaborations between Pulmonary and Vascular Biology faculty and other UT Southwestern faculty in the Departments of Internal Medicine, Cell Biology, Physiology, Pharmacology and Biophysics, and by the participation of Pulmonary and Vascular Biology faculty in numerous training and center grants across the campus. Recently a shared effort by Pulmonary and Vascular Biology and the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine (PCCM) in the Department of Internal Medicine resulted in procurement of a coveted T32 training grant from the National Institutes of Health to support postdoctoral research training at UT Southwestern in Lung Biology and Disease. Pulmonary and Vascular Biology is one of but a handful of research divisions in Pediatric departments nationwide. The division's mission is to expand our basic understanding of lung and vascular diseases, striving to gain new knowledge that will ultimately lead to new diagnostic, prophylactic and therapeutic strategies. Within the context of lung and vascular diseases, the division focuses on lung and vascular development and responses to inflammation and injury. The faculty members in Pulmonary and Vascular Biology are physician-scientists from the Pediatric divisions of Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine (Drs. Rashmin Savani and Phil Shaul), Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (Drs. Margaret Schwarz and Julio P\u00e9rez Font\u00e1n), Pediatric Infectious Disease (Dr. Michelle Gill), Pediatric Respiratory Medicine (Drs. Carolyn Cannon and Olatunji Williams) and Pediatric Endocrinology (Dr. Ellen Grishman); and Drs. Chieko Mineo and Michi Umetani, who are basic scientists working in partnership with the physician-scientists. Faculty Philip W. Shaul, M.D., Professor, is Director of Pulmonary and Vascular Biology and holds the Lowe Foundation Professorship in Pediatric Critical Care Research at UT Southwestern. He specializes in neonatal-perinatal medicine, and his research interests are focused on signaling molecules in endothelial cell caveolae/lipid rafts that influence vascular health and disease. Dr. Shaul received his B.A. from Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire, in 1977 and his medical degree from the University of Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1981. He received residency training in pediatrics at the Children's Medical Center of Cincinnati, University of Cincinnati, from 1981 to 1984, and was a fellow in neonatal-perinatal medicine at the Women and Infants Hospital of Rhode Island, Brown University, Providence, RI from 1984 to 1986. He joined the faculty of UT Southwestern in 1986. Dr. Shaul was elected to the American Society for Clinical Investigation in 1999, and he was President of the Society for Pediatric Research in 2005-2006.

Savani, M.B., (Texas) Perinatal Physician Excellence Award 170Respiratory MedicineRespiratory Medicine The Division of Respiratory Medicine provides care for infants through adolescents with a variety of respiratory disorders, including acute and chronic lung parenchyma and airway diseases, ventilatory muscle weakness, and disorders of neurologic control of breathing. For example, the division cares for a large cohort of chronically ventilated children, children with pulmonary artery hypertension, children in the accredited Cystic Fibrosis Care and Teaching Center, as well as children served by the multi-bed Sleep Disorders Center. Created in 2006, Respiratory Medicine encompasses eleven physicians and numerous associated healthcare professionals who together, form a truly multidisciplinary program at the two Children's campuses. Respiratory Medicine continued to grow with the addition of a new faculty member. Dr. Preeti Sharma joined us as a board-certified pediatric pulmonologist after completing her pediatric pulmonary medicine fellowship at the University of Chicago, Comer Children's Hospital. Additional faculty has allowed the enhancement of existing programs. For example, the respiratory inpatient service, serving the patients in the general pulmonary program and the various specialized programs including sleep, pulmonary vascular disease, asthma and cystic fibrosis, has expanded substantially. In 2010, the Respiratory Medicine Division began providing separate coverage of the respiratory service on the seventh floor of the C-Tower at Children's and the consultative service provided throughout the inpatient services at both Children's campuses, as well as the neonatal intensive care unit at Parkland. Faculty Julio P\u00e9rez Font\u00e1n, M.D., Professor and Vice Chairman of Pediatrics, holds the Joel B. Steinberg, M.D. Chair in Pediatrics and serves as the Interim Director of Respiratory Medicine at UT Southwestern. He is also Associate Dean for Pediatric Services and Program Development at UT Southwestern and Executive V i c e P r e s i d e n t o f M e di cal Aff air s a t C hil dr e n ' s . Th e n e ural c o n tri b u ti o n t o l un g injury and biology of neurokinins in the lung are the focus of Dr. P\u00e9rez Font\u00e1n's research. Dr. P\u00e9rez Font\u00e1n received his medical degree summa cum laude from the Universidad de Santiago De Compostela, Spain, in 1977. He performed his residency in Pediatrics at the Universidad Autonoma de Barcelona from 1978 to 1981, and a fellowship at the University of California and the Cardiovascular Research Institute in San Francisco from 1981 to 1984. Prior to joining the UT Southwestern faculty, Dr. P\u00e9rez Font\u00e1n was a member of the faculty at the University of California in San Francisco, Yale University and Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. He was honored as the Alumni Endowed Professor of Pediatrics at Washington University School of Medicine in 2001. Carolyn L.

Each faculty member is developing areas of interest for scholarship, which includes research in cystic fibrosis, lung development, pulmonary consequences of neuromuscular diseases and asthma. Researchers in Dr. Julio P\u00e9rez Font\u00e1n's laboratory investigate the influence of the nervous system on the structure and function of the airways. Physiological and neuroanatomical studies have contributed to the present view of the bronchomotor system as an integral part of breathing control through the relationships between vagal and phrenic outflows and the overlap between the bronchomotor and breathing networks. Recent attention has been focused on the participation of sensory neuropeptides in the regulation of the inflammatory response. Dr. Carolyn Cannon's group focuses on the pathogenesis of pulmonary infection with several related bacterial species found in the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and development of novel therapies to treat these infections. Using both in vitro and mouse models of infection, the Cannon laboratory explores the role that the defective gene and protein underlying CF, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) organisms. The group also studies the activity of a series of novel silver-based antimicrobials, silver N-heterocyclic carbene complexes (SCCs), which inhibit the growth of all bacterial species tested to date including the CF lung pathogens P. aeruginosa , methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Bcc organisms. Nebulized SCCs, formulated both as a solution and after incorporation into nanoparticles, have efficacy in mouse infection models. To understand silver toxicity and detoxification, the Cannon group also studies the impact of silver on bacteria and lung cells. Insights from these studies may lead to methods to abrogate the development of silver toxicity or, through inhibition of bacterial detoxification pathways, resistance. Dr. Peter Luckett's research interests center on acute lung injury, mechanical ventilation, near-fatal asthma, pulmonary outcomes in neuromuscular disease, and clinical trials in pediatric critical care. Recent work includes development of a clinical trial of strict glucose control in critically ill children using a computer-driven protocol. Dr. Peter Schochet investigates the respiratory consequences of early-onset scoliosis. Additionally, Dr. Schochet continues to work with Dr. Susan T. Iannaccone, the Jimmy Elizabeth Westcott Distinguished Chair in Pediatric Neurology, to study the respiratory complications of neuromuscular disease. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) affects 30 to 50 percent of premature infants in the United States and results in p art fr o m th e di s ru p ti o n o f n o rm al l un g d e v e l o p m e n t . D r . O l a tun j i W illi am s s tri v e s t o un d e r s t an d th e m o l e c ul ar mechanisms that regulate lung development, an understanding that is vital to disease prevention and treatment. It is now known that in addition to prematurity, environmental stresses such as hypoxia (low oxygen) and hyperoxia (high oxygen) can also disrupt lung development and that these processes are associated with elevated activation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-), a growth factor that regulates lung development. Dr. Williams' research focus is dedicated to defining and manipulating molecules that regulate TGF- signaling and activation in order to promote alveolar and vascular growth in BPD. Dr. Williams work has been presented in three international conferences in the last year. Clinical Activities Inpatient Service Dr. Yadira Rivera and Dr. Carolyn Cannon oversee the Pediatric Pulmonary Medicine inpatient administrative duties. Dr. Rivera has been instrumental in the development of several process improvement initiatives. The Inpatient Pulmonary Service as it exists now was created in 2009 and consists of an Admissions Service and a Consult/Bronchoscopy Service. Assigned at all times to the Pulmonary Admissions Service are one Pediatric Pulmonary Medicine physician, one senior Pediatrics resident, two general Pediatrics interns and an Anesthesia resident. A Pharm-D, a nutritionist, a social worker, a care coordinator, a respiratory therapist and a registered charge nurse participate in rounds on a regular basis. The patient population on this service consists primarily but is not limited to patients with chronic respiratory failure on mechanical ventilation and patients with neuromuscular diseases hospitalized for an acute respiratory process, acute asthma exacerbations and status asthmaticus, complicated pneumonias, patients status post airway surgery including but not limited to obstructive sleep apnea, chronic bronchiectasis with an acute exacerbation, chronic lung 174Respiratory Medicinedisease of prematurity with an acute respiratory illness, interstitial lung disease with an acute respiratory illness or for steroid pulses or other immunosuppressive agents. The pulmonary service has been designated the pilot service for a new program named \"Revitalizing Care at the Bedside.\" Among other things this program will actively incorporate patients and family members into daily rounding activities. This program intends to improve patient care, as well as satisfaction of patients and their families. The Consult Service provides service to both the entire Children's Dallas Medical Center, as well as the Parkland Health system NICU. One Respiratory Medicine physician and an inpatient pulmonary nurse practitioner are assigned to the Consult Service at all times. Inpatient bronchoscopies are performed either in the Main Operating Room (OR), Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) or Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Bronchoscopies are assisted by the Main OR Respiratory Therapy department. The Respiratory Medicine Inpatient Service faculty continue to provide a once or twice a week rotating lecture schedule for the residents. Teaching is also provided on a rotating schedule by a pulmonary nurse practitioner, asthma educator, speech pathologist and respiratory therapist. A core grou p of pulmonary and general pediatrics textbooks has been incorporated into the inpatient pulmonary rotation. These textbooks are stored in the pulmonary floor and can be utilized by general pediatrics and anesthesia residents rotating through the inpatient pulmonary service. The inpatient pulmonary service remains sub-divided into the current two components (Admissions and Consults/ Bronchoscopy), each of which is headed by a pediatric pulmonary physician. An inpatient nurse practitioner assists the consult pulmonary attending. A leader respiratory therapist participates in daily rounds along with the team of physicians and the charge nurse. The pulmonary service began incorporating family-centered, bedside rounds on a twice weekly basis to improve team communication. As a quality improvement initiative, the service began tracking days without blood stream infections. Further, the care team now holds afternoon \"huddles' to identify the patients with worrisome courses that warrant closer monitoring overnight. Outpatient Services Dr. Tanya Martinez leads the development and organization of the outpatient clinics and also oversees the Comprehensive Asthma Program at Children's. The outpatient care activities of the Respiratory Medicine Division encompass a comprehensive center with the capability of evaluating a variety of respiratory disorders in a multidisciplinary approach. The outpatient clinical area is housed on the 5th floor of the Pavilion Outpatient Building at Children's Medical Center in Dallas with a limited number of clinics at the Children's at Legacy Outpatient Center in Plano. Consultative services are provided through the combined effort between physicians and advanced nurse practitioners. The outpatient clinic staff includes nursing, respiratory therapy, social work and nutrition who are available to supply support and help coordinate equipment and home nursing needs. In addition, the staff is qualified to provide education in respiratory equipment use and asthma management in the clinic setting. A pulmonary function laboratory is conveniently located adjacent to the outpatient pulmonary clinic area. Dr. Olatunji Williams serves as the Medical Director for the pulmonary function laboratory, supervising the execution and interpretation of studies. The laboratory has the capacity to perform comprehensive respiratory function evaluation. Available testing includes simple spirometry, lung volumes, diffusing capacity, exhaled nitric oxide, evaluation of airway reactivity and cardiopulmonary exercise testing. In addition, Children's Dallas has the only infant pulmonary function laboratory in North Texas. Specialized outpatient clinical activities include: Pulmonary Aerodigestive Disorders Clinic (PAD) Dr. Yadira Rivera-Sanchez staffs the pulmonary component of the PAD clinic, a multidisciplinary effort between Respiratory Medicine, ENT, Gastroenterology and Speech Therapy that provides comprehensive evaluation of children with complex problems involving the upper airway, pulmonary and upper digestive tract. Clinics occur on the first Monday of each month. Asthma Outpatient Services Drs. Martinez and Rivera-Sanchez serve as liaisons between the Respiratory Medicine and the Allergy Divisions that jointly staff the High Risk Multidisciplinary Asthma Clinic that provides comprehensive evaluation of patients with 175Respiratory Medicineuncontrolled asthma and life threatening asthma. The team that includes six certified asthma educators works closely with the Asthma Management Program at CMC to provide ongoing education to our asthma patients. Patients are seen in the shared Pulmonary and Allergy Clinic area. Initial funding for the clinic through the Crystal Charity Ball has been approved and expected for 2011. Cystic Fibrosis Care and Teaching Center Dr. Claude Prestidge serves as director of the Cystic Fibrosis Care and Teaching Center at Children's Medical Center Dallas, which cares for the largest population of patients with cystic fibrosis in North Texas. Other physicians caring for the children with cystic fibrosis include Drs. Michael Brown, Carolyn Cannon, Steven Copenhaver and Andrew Gelfand. The center is fully accredited by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. The care team includes dedicated nurses, as well as a social worker, respiratory therapist, nutrition specialist, child life specialist and clinical psychologist. Dr. Meghana Sathe, a pediatric gastroenterologist with an interest in cystic fibrosis participates in clinics on a weekly basis. Clinics are held on Monday at the Legacy campus and on Tuesday, Thursday and Friday at the Dallas campus. Neuromuscular Disorders Clinic Dr. Peter Luckett holds one pulmonary clinic per week focused on caring for the respiratory needs of patients with neuromuscular disease. Drs. Peter Schochet and Peter Luckett staff the Adolescent Muscle clinic, which is a multi-disciplinary clinic devoted to the unique needs of older teenagers with various Neuromuscular Diseases. The clinic is a joint effort with the Neurology Department and provides evaluation and management of children with pulmonary involvement secondary to neuromuscular disease. The multidisciplinary clinic focused on adolescent patients is held once a month. Pulmonary Hypertension Clinic Dr. Olatunji Williams has remained closely involved with improving the care of patients with pulmonary vascular disease, including caring for patients with pulmonary hypertension and serving as the pediatric pulmonology consultant for the Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia Center here at UT Southwestern.t\u0001Comprehensive evaluation of patients diagnosed or presenting with symptoms suggestive of pulmonary hypertension t\u0001Clinics occur once a month Sleep Disorders Center Dr. Kamal Naqvi directs the sleep program, which provides clinical services on a variety of sleep- and respiratory- control-related disorders. t\u0001Comprehensive center for the evaluation of sleep disorders in children t\u0001Dedicated monthly clinic to provide follow up care for children using non-invasive positive pressure therapy to treat sleep disordered breathing t\u0001State of the art equipment and technologies available to perform polysomnography, multiple sleep latency test, positive airway pressure/non-invasive ventilation titrations and actigraphy t\u0001Sleep technology staff available for equipment education and support t\u0001Five half-day clinics a week 176Respiratory MedicinePresentations/Teaching Activities Members of the Respiratory Medicine division actively engage in teaching medical students and residents at UT Southwestern.

Its clinics are unique in the region and are staffed by the only board-certified pediatric rheumatologists in North Texas. The division was one of the first pediatric rheumatology subspecialties in the country, founded in the 1950s by Dr. Chester Fink, one of the first pediatric rheumatologists elected as a Master of the American College of Rheumatology. It has continuously trained fellows from all over the world for more than 20 years, many of whom now head divisions of their own. The Arthritis Clinic, also established by Dr. Fink in the late 1950s, has grown from a few patients seen only a half-day each month to one of the country's largest clinics for children with rheumatic diseases. The rheumatology clinics at Children's Medical Center Dallas and Texas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children (TSRHC) strive to provide the highest quality of care to their patients. The multidisciplinary team at TSRHC now includes three nurse coordinators, two pediatric nurse practitioners, a physic al therapist, an occupational therapist and a dietician. Disease-specific templates for history, physical exams and new patient consults ensure a standardized and thorough collection of information from each patient on each clinic visit. Patient-reported outcomes are monitored with visual analog scales and questionnaires. Individual disease-specific flow sheets, unique to the clinic, allow tracking of all aspects of a patient's care across time. They also function as care maps, prompting attention to preventive care and quality indicators of care. These include evaluation of bone health, assessment of coronary risk factors in lupus patients, assessment of pneumococcal immunization in immunosuppressed patients, radiographic surveillance for bone erosions in arthritis patients, and a schedule for ophthalmologic exams to assess uveitis, retinal vasculitis and possible drug toxicity. Additionally, the Rheumatology division is involved in both translational and clinical research, with 60 percent of patients participating in a research study. Faculty Marilynn G. Punaro, M.D., Professor, is Director of Pediatric Rheumatology at UT Southwestern. Dr. Punaro's clinical interests focus on juvenile arthritis, lupus, scleroderma, systemic arthritis and vasculitis. She is the Site Principal Investigator for several NIH treatment trials for lupus and systemic onset arthritis. Dr. Punaro received her medical degree from Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1977. She was a resident in Pediatrics at UT Southwestern/Children's from 1977 to 1980 and held a fellowship in Pediatric Rheumatology at UT Southwestern from 1980 to 1982. Dr. Punaro is the elected leader of the pediatric rheumatology program directors and the elected representative for pediatric rheumatology to the Council of Pediatric Subspecialties. She was elected to Best Doctors in America and was named a Texas Super Doctor by Texas Monthly magazine in 2008 and 2009. In May 2010, Dr. Punaro was feathured in a D Magazine article as one of the best pediatricians in Dallas. She was invited by the American College of Rheumatology to serve as an expert in the development of treatment guidelines for juvenile arthritis and also was selected as an international expert in pediatric lupus to serve on a committee establishing definitions for outcome measures. Marilynn G. Punaro, M.D. Director, Pediatric Rheumatology Translational research by our division that impacts our patient care was published in 2010 in Nature the highest ranked science journal in the world. 179RheumatologyAlisa C.

The use of gene-expression analysis in children with systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SOJIA) performed by members of this division has led to great advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of this disorder. This insight directed the novel application of the Interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist anakinra for treatment of SOJIA, which provided impressive evidence of the long-term efficacy and safety of anakinra in the treatment of children with SOJIA. Another IL-1 blocker, Rilonacept, also has been studied in a Phase I trial. Gene-expression analysis has been applied to the study of children with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and, again, has provided important insight into potential pathophysiologic mechanisms by identifying increased Type 1 interferon production in these patients that correlated with clinical disease activity. The Rheumatology division also is participating in two multi-site, NIH-funded trials in pediatric SLE:t\u0001Development of autoimmunity during puberty t\u0001RAndomized Placebo Phase study Of Rilonacept in the Treatment of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (RAPPORT) Nutrition-related problems such as obesity may modify outcomes in pediatric lupus because of potential contribution to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease. A pilot, cross-sectional study to examine the prevalence and determinants of obesity and insulin resistance in pediatric SLE is near completion. The nutrition and body composition assessment, using whole body DXA and anthropometry, has revealed greater adiposity in children with SLE compared to controls. Future analysis will clarify the role of glucocorticoid use and disease specific factors to the risk of obesity and dyslipidemia in pediatric SLE. Julie Fuller, M.D. Research interests: Juvenile dermatomyositis Why corticosteroids help lupus patients Researchers at UT Southwestern have uncovered the biological rationale for why large doses of corticosteroids given repeatedly over several weeks may help individuals with lupus, a chronic inflammatory disease that affects more than 1 million people in the U.S. Ashley Cooper M.D. Research interests: Genetics of rheumatic disease 181RheumatologyThe Dallas Registry for Pediatric Rheumatic disease is a comprehensive database designed to characterize the clinical features and outcomes of subjects with autoimmune connective tissue disease. Since 2009, approximately 200 subjects with SLE followed at our center since 1994 have been enrolled. Currently the data analysis is elucidating traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease and characterizing the use of glucocorticoids during induction therapy. The data is also being used for the epidemiological characterization of a cohort of pediatric lupus participating in a translational project sponsored by our collaborators which examines gene expression patterns. Clinical Activities This year there were 430 inpatient consultations/admissions at Children's and TSRHC. The types of admission at the two hospitals vary significantly in the acuteness of the illness and the types of therapy given. Inpatients at Children's are primarily patients with lupus and patients seen for consultation who have been admitted for other services. They are more acutely ill or have difficult diagnostic problems. Patients at the TSRHC Rheumatology Clinic may be admitted for intensive occupational or physical therapy and rehabilitation, or for a short period of time for intravenous pulses of steroid, cyclophosphamide or other drugs. Historically, TSRHC has served as the major site for outpatient clinics. Currently about 1,500 active patients are seen in approximately 3,500 outpatient visits per year, including approximately 400 new patient visits in six half-day clinics per week. Dr. Punaro is Director of Arthritis Services at TSRHC and all pediatric rheumatology faculty members staff at least one clinic per week. Outpatient clinics at Children's staffed by rheumatology faculty also operate four days per week. These clinics primarily evaluate new patients, with more than 500 new patient visits per year, and those with systemic lupus. Those patients who have clearly defined rheumatic diseases with a primary musculoskeletal component, such as juvenile arthritis, dermatomyositis and scleroderma, are managed at TSRHC. Patients with rheumatic diseases affecting multiple organ systems, such as systemic lupus, and those with benign causes of musculoskeletal pain are managed at Children's. Presentations/Teaching Activities The division provides the major instruction to pediatric residents in the evaluation of the musculoskeletal system and the assessment of rheumatic diseases. It also provides didactic teaching for the pediatric residents on the basics of rheumatology and directs teaching for the pediatric residents in the regular departmental clinical conferences and as part of inpatient consultation services.A rheumatology elective is available for pediatric residents and fourth-year medical students. The objectives of this elective are to:t\u0001Develop a working differential diagnosis of arthritis in childhood t\u0001Learn a complete joint examination and a physical evaluation of rheumatologic patients t\u0001Examine and discuss patients from all major collagen vascular disease categories: juvenile arthritis, dermatomyositis, scleroderma and SLE The pediatric residents see outpatients in clinics under the supervision of one of the members of the rheumatology faculty. A notebook of selected articles about rheumatic disease, including original material, has been developed by Dr. Punaro as curriculum for the elective. Residents are encouraged to attend clinical conferences offering didactic teaching for fellows. This elective has been very popular with residents.Outpatient clinic visits handled by staff 4,537 Inpatient consultations/admissions per year 430Juvenile arthritis patients receiving treatment 798New patients 910 2010 Active Rheumatology Patients Juvenile Arthritis 794 Systemic Lupus 117 Dermatomyositis 59 Miscellaneous Other Rheumatic Diseases 588 1,653 182RheumatologyTrainees in other departments also spend time in the rheumatology clinics. Residents in Physical Medicine and other specialties may receive some of their training through the division. In addition to resident training, the division has one of only 30 accredited programs for fellowship training in Pediatric Rheumatology. Dr. Punaro is Program Director for the Pediatric Rheumatology fellowship program, and she serves as faculty for the Internal Medicine Rheumatology training program. Marilynn G.
