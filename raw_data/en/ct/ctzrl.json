DO NOT be afraid of them; they will not break. With the following tips and the ut most of care, you can give your child the best life possible, despite the challenges of EB. Different types of EB call for different levels of care, and not all children thrive despite our best efforts. DO your best and never give up. DO educate yourself and those who care for your child on the best methods to use for your child's care. DO NOT be afraid to question anything and everyt hing in regards to your child's needs, even if that means questioning the medical co mmunity or those advising you. Each child is an individual, and there is no \"one size fits all\" treatment for EB. Some things work well for one child, yet may be damaging to another. DO experiment to see what works best for your child and ask other parents of EB children what works best for them. They are often your best resource. DO NOT use adhesives, such as adhesive banda ges or tapes on your child's skin. DO pop blisters as they occur and/or recur. A sterile needle or very sharp clean scissors work best. See Blister Popping below. DO NOT remove the blister cap from the freshly popped blister. DO use soft, non-abrasive materials for bedding and clothing. Satins and silks or very soft cottons are especially comf ortable. It is often a good idea to turn clothing inside-out so that the seams do not rub against your child's skin. DO NOT pick up your child from under his/her ar mpits. Pay attention to where his/her wounds are, and pick him/her up from his/he r bottom or upper thighs and across his/her back provided these areas are not severely dama ged. Take care to distribute pressure to the palms of your hands rather than just your fingertips. Cradling small infants on a piece of sheepskin can be very safe and comforta ble, especially when moving them from place to place. DO NOT take your child's temperature recta lly. Use an ear thermometer (without pulling the ear) or take the temperature from under the armpit. When speaking with your child's health care provider, be sure to mention the method used to check the temperature. An overview of treatment EB is caused by missing or dys functional connecting structures between the layers of the skin. It is as if the glue that holds the skin together is missing. Another example is to imagine two pieces of Velcro stuck togeth er; in the case of EB , the hooked, receiving- side is either missing its hooks or the hooks are improperly shaped, making for a weaker connection. Understanding this, the next ques tion that often comes to mind is \"how is EB treated?\" Currently, there is no cure or specific treatment to alleviate the complications of EB. However, great stride s have been made in the understanding and treatment of this disease. Our job as parents or caregivers of an EB ch ild is to provide protection and the resources for good health in order to provide our childr en with as normal a life as possible. The different types of EB require different appr oaches to care. Many persons with milder forms of EB have minimal involvement and n eed little or no treatment. Some of the less severe forms also improve with age. The mo re severe forms of EB often require hours of intensive nursing care, similar to the care used on burn victims. A team of many doctors and health professionals is often required. It is best to take a team approach in caring for an EB child. The members of this team ma y include the primary ca re physician (often the pediatrician), the derm atologist, any nurses involved, the pediatric dentist, the gastrointestinal doctor (deals with digestive disorders), the dietitian or nutritionist, the plastic surgeon, the psychologist or social wo rker, and the genetic c ounselor. In the non- medical area, some of the care team may include siblings, relatives, babysitters, teachers and others. The primary goals of EB care are: protection of the skin against trauma, prevention of infection, maintaining the hi ghest possible level of nutri tion and avoiding dietary complications, minimizing deformities and cont ractures, and lastly, sustaining a strong support system and a positive attitude. Many of the complications of EB can be lessened or even avoided with proper early intervention and care. The following are suggestions for approachi ng the care of all fo rms of EB. Each recommendation may or may not pertain to ever y form of EB, so discretion and careful experimentation should serve as a guide in each individual case. Section 1: Protecting the Skin EB is caused by abnormalities in the connecting structures that hold the different layers of skin together. Because of these abnormalitie s, friction on the skin leads to blistering. The amount of friction needed to produce blis tering depends on the type of EB. In some cases, blistering is only produced after vigor ous exertion, but in ot hers, something as trivial as a seam rubbing agai nst the skin may produce a blis ter. A primary goal of EB care is to reduce the likelihood of developing new blisters. Preventing all blisters from occurring is impossible, but by using these suggestions, your child's general comfort will be improved. Use common sense, and keep thes e ideas in mind in your daily care of your child. 1a. Clothes In many forms of EB, even slight friction on th e skin causes blisters. Dress your child in breathable, soft clothing with minimal seam s to reduce the likelihood of blistering. For babies, turn clothing inside-out so that the seams are not directly against the skin. Fabrics such as satins, silks and soft cottons are ideal materials for both bedding and clothing. Loose-fitting and lightweight clothes are ty pically comfortable; however, snug tights or leggings help to hold bandages in place and also help to protect the legs. Leggings can be used instead of stretch netting (see Bandaging ). Always keep in mind that clothing should be easy to put on and take off. Be es pecially attentive to the head area, ears and armpits when dressing or undressing your child. 1b. Shoes Shoes are a challenge for some EB childre n. Firm or poorly-fitting shoes may produce painful blisters on the feet. Using bandages to pa d the child's feet is helpful, but this also makes it more difficult to find shoes that f it properly over the padding. When looking for shoes, note where the seams are, whethe r or not the shoes are wide enough to accommodate extra padding if necessary, and if they will tend to rub in certain areas. Soft slippers, especially thos e lined with sheep skin, often work better than conventional shoes. Make sure the slippers or shoes have a wide opening for easy access. Children with severely affected feet often prefer not to wear shoes most of the time and just walk around with extra padding on their feet. 1c. Newborn comfort For newborn babies, it may be necessary to la y them on an absorbent pad rather than use a diaper. Cloth diapers may be preferred in some cases, although many of the disposable diapers with Velcro closures are desirable b ecause of their better absorbency. With a little extra padding at the pressure points, thes e often work just as well or better than cloth. Another suggestion is to cut the elastic leg cuffs out of disposab le diapers. It is very important to keep this area of the baby as clean and dry as possible. For bedding and car seats , sheepskin is an excellent padd ing material. Both natural and synthetic sheepskin work well and can be obtaine d fairly easily. Egg-crate foam or other foam materials can be used to add extra padd ing beneath bedding as well. Do not lay a baby directly on the sheepskin or foam to slee p. Silk, satin or soft cotton sheets should be used over the foam or sheepskin. Water or air mattresses can also help to reduce friction and add comfort. Section 2: Skin Care and Bandaging As mentioned in Section 1 , despite our best efforts, it is impossible to prevent all blisters from forming. Areas of skin breakdown will also occur. Maximal skin care, with attention to these areas, is very important in EB for several reasons . Proper wound care helps to minimize pain, promotes healing, a nd reduces the likelihood of developing skin infections. This section outlines a recomme nded approach to skin care and bandaging. 2a. Setting up your supplies Once you are familiar with the bandaging materials that work best for your child and know at what step of the bandaging proce ss to use each item, bandaging set up becomes fairly routine. It is very important that all set up be done ahead of time. You do not want to be looking for items or cutting bandages while a limb or other area is exposed and unprotected. Setting up your supplies before bath time is helpful. Alternatively, if your child is old enough to be in the bathtub uns upervised, supplies could be set up at that time. Have a clean surface set aside for your ba ndage supplies. For a list of suggested products, see Section 3 . All scissors and tools should be pre-sanitized. Open all packages and precut dressings to size. If n eeded, coat dressings with additional ointment at this time. Applying topical products (ointments, antibiotics , etc.) to the dressings is easier and less damaging to the skin than applying them directly to the wound. Setting up your supplies is an exercise in estimation. Think about the areas to be dressed and visualize how much of each product will be used and what sizes will work best. For instance, a small child's leg with wounds on the knees, feet, and sh in area, will likely require several strips of Vaseline gauze, pe rhaps some Mepilex Transfer, or some other non-adherent dressing. It will also need 2-3 rolls of 3- or 4-inch rolled gauze, and tubular netting, cut to fit the length of the limb. Your child will need to sit or lay on a bed, table or chai r during the bandaging process, and this also needs to be clean and rea dy to go before bandaging starts. The surface should be soft, comfortable and clean. A cl ean towel over a washable sheepskin works well. Blue chux pads, or a similar product, a dd a waterproof layer, and can be added on top of the towel, and then covered with anot her towel. After bath ing, the top towel and chux can be removed, leaving a dr y layer for bandaging. Bandaging may seem tedious, but it is a necessa ry part of your child's care. Allowing your child to listen to music or watch a vi deo during bandaging will help combat the boredom. Also, being organized helps to st reamline the bandaging process. It also minimizes disruption to your child, and redu ces the likelihood of contaminating your supplies. Remember to always keep clean liness a top priority. Bandaging is not a surgical procedure, and items will not be co mpletely sterile. Once packages are opened, they are no longer sterile. However, with common sense and care, contamination with bacteria and germs can be kept to a minimum. 2b. Bathing Bathing is very important for children with EB. Washing the skin helps remove dry, dead skin and the crusts from areas of skin breakdown. It also helps to reduce the amount of bacteria on the skin, helping to prevent in fection. Lastly, soaking in water helps soften bandages that are stuck to the skin, making th eir removal less painful. Your child's doctor may recommend adding household bleach , vinegar or medicated washes to your child's bath water. Be sure to sanitize the bathtub / shower with bl each before and after your child bathes. When helping with your child's skin care, first make sure your hands are scrupulously clean! Wash them with soap and water and dry them with a clean towel. Before your child gets into the bath / show er, begin removing their bandages. Netting and the layers of padding can be cut off. Be careful when removing the bandages in direct contact with the skin. Any bandage th at does not come off easily can be left on and soaked off in the water. Newborn babies are often difficult to handle, so use extreme care and try not to let your hands slip on their damp skin. Rather than immersing them in a shallow tub, it may be necessary to bathe them in se ctions. Remove a portion of the baby's bandages, and using a basin, wash the exposed areas. A new, clean turkey baster can be used to gently flush wounds. A second rinse with clean water or water with bleach or vinegar (if recommended by your child's doctor) is a good idea as well. This process is then repeated for the other areas. Older babies and young children can sit on a soft towel and be bathed gently, or use the method described for newborns if bandage re moval seems too damaging. Older children may choose either to bathe or shower. For al l ages, soaking off bandages helps to prevent sticking, minimizing injury to the surrounding sk in. If soaking does not help, a dab of Aquaphor \u00ae ointment or a similar product such as petroleum jelly will often release the bandage. In the bath, pay attention to any ra w area on the skin. Note any areas that are moist and oozing as they are pot ential sights for infection. 2c. Blister Popping After your child's skin is clean, any new b listers need to be popped before bandaging begins. Contrary to what is taught in regards to normal skin, in EB it is important to pop blisters as they occur. In normal skin, the connections betw een the layers help keep the blister contained in a small area. However, in the absence of proper connections, there is little resistance to keep blisters from growing bigger and bigger. The pressure of the fluid in the blister lifts the nearby skin, making th e blister larger. Popping blisters helps to keep them from spreading. It is importan t to leave the blister cap on the wound, as it serves as natural protection or a covering for th e area. The blister cap will eventually dry up and lift off, but leaving it in place often a llows the lower layer of skin to heal a bit before being exposed. There are several good methods to pop blisters . These include using a sterile needle, scalpel, or very sharp tiny sc issors. Keep in mind where the blister will be draining, and pop it at the lowest point along its edge so that gravity will further assi st it in draining the fluid. If using a needle or scalpel, be ve ry careful not to poke directly towards the patient. Instead, slide the needle or scalpel car efully in a parallel direction with the skin. You will be far less likely to jab your child, a nd it allows the blister to drain through the slit. When using a needle or scalpel, your goa l is to make a small tear in the blister. Avoid simply making a small hole, as this wi ll close up quickly. If using scissors, you can actually cut a small slit by basically pinchi ng a very small section of the blister cap between the scissor blades. Unlike needles a nd scalpels, scissors ar e not disposable, so be sure to clean and sanitize your scissors frequently (see Section 3a ). Sterile gauze can be used to absorb the blister fluid. Anothe r effective and less expensive option is a clean tissue. Gently touch a tissue to the bliste r opening, and the fluid will be wicked out easily. It is best to avoid pressing on or rubbing the bliste r to try to empty it. This may force the fluid to move away from the openi ng and expand the size of the blister. If you must press on it at all, be sure to press the fluid towards the opening. 2d. Moisturizing the skin Using lotions, creams or ointments will help keep your child's skin moisturized, keeping your child comfortable. Dry sk in is more likely to itch (see Itching ). Moisturizers can be used all over your child's body if desired. Ointments are also applied to wounds to promote wound healing and reduce scarring. It may be necessary to rotate the products you use. EB tends to cycle and what works well for a while may become less effective after a long period of time. As an exam ple, you could alternate between using Aquaphor \u00ae Healing Ointment for a month and th en A&D ointment for a month. For particularly stubborn wounds that are not responding to these ointments, try some Zinc Oxide ointment for a couple of days. 2e. Bandaging There is no \"one size fits all\" care plan for EB. You will find certain bandages or routines that work best for your child. Th ese suggestions are designed to highlight the rationale for the steps in wound care and serve as guiding principles for your child's care plan. A list of suggested w ound care products can be found in Section 3 . Bandaging wounds is important for several reas ons. Firstly, dressings help reduce the pain of open wounds. They also provide a ba rrier that keeps irrita ting substances, which may be painful as well, out of the wound. The skin also heals better in a moist, covered environment. New skin grows in from the e dges of wounds, and this is hampered if the wound is dry. Bandages also protect wounds, making infection less likely. Additionally, bandaging and padding on non-wounded skin he lps prevent damage from trauma. The first layer of bandages is in direct c ontact with the wound. For this reason, it is important to use products designed not to stick to the skin. Used with ointments, these non-adherent dressings provide the first layer of coverage over the wound. Conventional dressings, such as gauze, dry out and stick to wounds, leading to pain and damage to healing skin when removed. B ecause non-adherent dres sings do not stick to the wound, they are less damaging to the skin and allow quicker wound healing. After the non-adherent layer is in place, absorbent dressings make up the second layer. Various types of gauze or soft wraps are ab sorbent dressings. They help to absorb drainage from the wounds and also function as padding or protection for delicate parts of the body. Some non-adherent dressings also have absorptive properties, but those dressings that are not specifi cally non-adherent should not be used directly on top of wounds. Finally, a layer of netting can be used over the top of th e absorbent dressings to keep everything in place. This breathable, stretcha ble material conforms to the shape of your child's body. Netting is only to be used over other layers of bandages; it should not be used directly against the skin. If possible, tr y to avoid using tape to secure bandages. If tape must be used, use paper tape and apply it to a dressing such as rolled gauze. Never use tape directly on the skin. 2f. Helpful hints Medical gloves (e.g. latex or vinyl gloves) are not recommended for handling an EB child's skin. They tend to grab the skin and can actually cause more damage. Minimize the risk of infection by frequently washi ng your hands, and if gloves must be used, lubricate them with an ointment such as pe troleum jelly. Gloves are handy for coating bandages with ointments during the set up process. Remember, soaking the bandages off helps to prevent sticking. Also, a dab of Aquaphor\u00ae Ointment or a similar product such as petroleum jelly will often release the stuck bandage. Scrupulous cleansing of wounds and frequent dressing changes are very important to prevent overt infection. The use of anti-bacterial washes, ointments, modified Deacon's solution (2 tsp regular strength household ble ach/1 gallon water), or wet soaks should be directed by a physician. It is a good idea to rinse an area with cl ean water once the bandages are removed, especially if the bandages must be kept on for protection during the bathing process. A clean turkey baster wo rks great for this job. If netting is not available, a section of rolled gauze can help bind bandages in place. After wrapping the affected area, leave a 6 inch tail of gauze hanging. Cut this tail up the center lengthwise, and then twist and wrap the 2 strips around the limb. Tie the 2 strips in a knot to secure them. Section 3: Supplies This section contains recomm endations on products that some families have found to be helpful. The brands and products listed are just a handful of what is available to help you get started. Your supplier may carry similar pr oducts in other brand names that work just as well. This list is not meant to pr omote a particular company or brand. There are too many available products to descri be every one, but this list gives you some general ideas to get started. They are listed in order of application, la yer by layer. It may be necessary to contact individual companies for more details on sizes and order #s, however, most bandaging supply companies can work off of the information given here and find the specifics for you. Never hesitate to ask for samples. Many companies will ship directly to you (a t a great savings) once they become aware of the intense needs of an EB patient. Also keep in mind that there is a huge mark up on products, and most companies and suppliers will work with you if the situation is explained. If your insurance company is reluctant to work with you, sending pictures of the types of wounds you are dealing with may help. Pictures are worth a thousand words. Remember that EB is a very rare disease, and most peopl e have no idea what yo u are dealing with. 3a. Tools Sharp scissors are needed to cut and trim ba ndages. Bandaging scissors can be ordered or found in medical supply stores. Regular scissors also work fo r cutting dressings to size. A pair of small, sharp, fine scissors can be us ed to pop blisters and trim dead skin. These can be found in the grooming section of any drug store. Manicure scissors work great. Be sure to clean and sanitize your scissors af ter use. Wash them in soap and water or wipe them down with alcohol. Neither of th ese processes will kill all germs, however, so periodically boiling scissors in water is also recommended. Needles or scalpels are useful for popping blisters but are sometimes hard to obt ain. Most medical supply companies or pharmacies require a prescrip tion from your doctor in order to obtain needles or scalpels. When using any of th ese tools on more than one area, avoid cross- contamination by sterilizing the tool between uses. 3b. O intments Several non-medicated ointments are availabl e over-the-counter wit hout a prescription. Aquaphor Healing Ointment is manufactured by Beiersdorf, Inc. A 14 oz. tub costs about $17. For more information, see www.AquaphorHealing.com . Over the counter petroleum jelly and zinc oxide are also handy ointments. Zinc oxide should not be overused on open wounds, however. It is best to rotate its use with other ointments. A & D ointment is also recommended. It is possible to get ointments covered by your insurance company. This may take a battle, but it is well worth it. Start by hav ing your physician write a prescription, as well as a letter, explaining how import ant these products are in your ch ild's skin care routine. Any product containing active ingredients (anti-itch creams, for example) should only be used after consultation with your physicia n. Active ingredients may be excessively absorbed through skin wounds. Likewise, antibiotic ointments should be used with caution and with the supervision of your physician. Some peopl e develop allergic reactions to topical antibi otics over time, and the prol onged use of certain topical antibiotics can lead to the development of inf ection with bacteria that are more difficult to treat. 3c. Non-adherent dressings Vaseline\u00ae Gauze is petrolatum-impregnated gauze. This dressing is very easy to use, relatively inexpensive and readily available. It comes in a variety of sizes. The commonly used sizes and the order numbers for the Kendall brand of Vaseline Gauze are listed. The 1/2\" X 72\" strips are handy for the web spaces between fingers and toes and for wrapping wounds on fingers and toes. Fo r this size, the order # is 8884-421600. The 3\" X 9\" size is order # 8884-413605, and the 3\" X 36\" size is order # 8884-415600. Aquaphor\u00ae Gauze is another good non-adhering dressi ng. However, it often needs some added ointment and does not conform quite as easily on small, tight areas. It is less stringy than Vaseline\u00ae Gauze. For a 3\" X 8\" size the order # is 45588000. This product is manufactured by Beiersdorf-Jobst, Inc. Mepitel \u00ae is an advanced, non-adherent silicone dressing that has been very beneficial in wound healing. Made by Molnlycke Hea lth Care, a Swedish company, its main drawback is its cost. It is not recommended for infected wounds. Th is product can be re- used by washing it with anti-bacterial soap, soaking it briefly in a bleach solution, and then drying it in a clean environment. For the 3\" X 4\" size, use order # 290710. For the 9\" X 12\" sheet, use order # 292005. Two other products made by this same company are Mepilex \u00ae and Mepilex Transfer \u00ae. Mepilex\u00ae has a 1/4 in ch-thick foam pad backing that draws infection and exudate from th e wound and into the pad. This product is especially useful on oozing wounds, but can be overly sticky on hea lthier skin. For the 4\" X 8\" size, use order # 294290. Mepilex Tr ansfer\u00ae is similar, but has a thinner backing and conforms more eas ily to tighter, bendable areas . The thinner foam also draws moisture out of the wound. For the 8\" X 20\" size, use order # 294592. More information is available at www.tendra.com . 3d. Absorbent dressings Rolled Gauze comes in many brands and sizes. One of the most common brands is Kendall Conform \u00ae, which is sold in non-sterile bags of 12 rolls per bag. This is a practical and economical way to order these ba ndages. For a bag of 2\" rolls, use order #2242, for 3\" rolls, use order #2244, and for 4\" rolls, use order #2247. These also come in 1\" and 6\" sizes. Another brand is Elastomull \u00ae, made by Beiersdorf. For the 1\" rolls, use order # 02088000. Cypress Medical Produc ts (McHenry, IL 60050) also makes a conforming gauze that is also latex-free. Fo r the 4\" rolls, use order # 41-54. Another brand is Duform \u00ae Conforming Bandage (Dumex U.S.A. Marrieta, GA. www.dumex.com). For the 4\" size, use order # 75124. Most brands of rolled gauze come in a variety of sizes, in addition to those listed here. Padding is often necessary for areas like the knees, elbows, and toes of small babies learning to crawl. A useful product in this regard is Kendall Kerlix (Large Roll). It is a 6-ply, loose-weave, rolled material similar to cheeseclo th. It works well as padding because of its fluffy texture, but it is not recommended for use directly against the skin. It is a bit coarse and may cause irritation. It can be folded in layers for thicker padding, if necessary. For a 4\" roll, use order #6715. 3e. Netting Stretch Netting is super handy as the final dressing product that holds everything neatly in place. There are several sizes and br ands of netting. Netting is an open-weave, tubular, elastic material th at can be cut to any length needed. One brand is Surg-O-Flex , made by Surg-O-Flex of America, P.O. Box 34, 1-800-334-2592. Also see their website: www.surgoflex.netfirms.com . It is ordered by size. Size A is for small extremitie s, and so forth. Western Medical Ltd., (64 North Summit Street, Tenafly, NJ 07670) makes 2 netting products: Surgilast \u00ae and BandNet \u00ae. Go to The order #s for Surgilast \u00ae are GL-701 for size 1 (very sma ll), GL-702 for size 2, and so on. Ezy Wrap \u00ae, made by Professional Products, Inc., P. O. Box 589, De Funiak Springs, Florida 32433, is another brand. This comes in a vari ety of sizes from 1 through 11. For size 7, use order #04807. Yet another brand is Se Pro Net , made by Acme United Corporation, Medical Products Division, Fairfield, CT 06430. For a size 2, use order #53120. Section 4. Other skin concerns 4a. Infections It is fundamentally important to do everythi ng possible to prevent in fections and to act quickly in addressing infections when they do occur. Infections tend to worsen wound areas, slowing healing time and increasing the tendency to itch. Infections may also be life-threatening. Signs of skin infecti on include increased, thick, and foul-smelling drainage from the wound. The appearance of infection should be monitored and watched carefully. Fever is a good indi cator of the seriousness of an active infection in an EB child. When treating with antibiotics, it is re commended to culture the area first, so that the proper antibiotic can be used. Antibiotic s are best used sparingly, but it is very important to finish any antibiotic program prescribed. Stopping an antibiotic treatment short may give bacteria the chance to multip ly, and these new bacteria often have a stronger resistance to antibiotics. 4b. Body Temperature Considerations In all forms of EB, it is impor tant to monitor body temperatur e. Most EB patients loose large amounts of body fluid th rough wound drainage. This ca n lead to dehydration. In addition, children with lots of bandages may become overheated. Obviously, the problems of heat stroke and dehydration are mo re likely in warmer climates. Encourage your child to drink lots of water. Always watch for signs of overh eating in your child and take their temperature often. This will give you an idea of their baseline temperature. Do not take your child's temperatur e rectally. Instead, carefully use an ear thermometer, but do not pull on the ear. Taking the temperat ure gently under the armpit is another method, however, it is less accurate. Tell your phys ician how the temperature was measured when communicating your concerns. 4c. Itching Itching is a major problem in all forms of EB. All of the causes of itching remain a mystery, but as wounds heal, or as infecti ons flare up, itching can become extremely troublesome. Keeping the skin well moisturi zed can be helpful. Also, as wounds heal, they often start to get dry a nd crusty along the edges. Ca refully trimming away these areas of dead, dry skin with ve ry clean scissors is helpful. Over-the-counter anti-itch sprays and creams should be used under the supervision of your physician. In some cases, prescription medications may be used as well. Section 5: Nutritional Concerns Nutritional needs should not be overlooked in the care of an EB ch ild. Good nutrition is fundamentally important for a ll children, but it is even more important for a child with EB. The EB child has nutritiona l needs similar to those of a patient with skin ulcers or burns. Extra protein and calories are required to help the skin regr ow. Protein loss and fluid loss from blistering and skin brea kdown also contribute to these demands. However, simply getting an EB child to eat more is a definite challenge as blisters and sores in the mouth and throat often make feeding painful. 5a. Feeding Tips Attention to the nutritional n eeds of an EB child should begi n at birth. Blistering in the newborn period may produce fluid and protein loss that should be monitored closely. Unless the baby requires isolation for medical reasons, bonding with the mother should be encouraged and will help in the early feed ing process. Oral bottle or breast feedings should be encouraged as soon as the sucking re flex is apparent, unless the doctor suggests otherwise. EB babies may demonstrate difficu lty in sucking due to blistering and pain in the mouth and throat. A Haberman\u00ae Feeder can be helpful in these cases. This special feeder was developed to help ch ildren born with cleft palates. The nipple contains a disc insert and valve that helps control the flow of liquid and lessens vacuum within the bottle. Alternatively, a larger slit or a dditional holes in a soft, sili cone nipple such as a preemie nipple may be helpful. A rubber-tipped medicine dropper could also be used. For older children, introducing many tastes a nd textures is important . Mouth and throat involvement that produces disc omfort can cause EB children to develop an aversion to foods. Keep experimenting to find foods your ch ild will eat! In the more severe forms of EB, the mouth and esophagus (food pipe) are often heavily involved. Soft foods should be encouraged. Hard or sharp foods, such as corn chips, may further damage the delicate oral tissues. Pureed foods are a good idea and can be made even easier to swallow if additional liquid is added. Remember that a mouth with sores will be more sensitive to temperature extremes, so avoid serving foods th at are too hot or too cold. Acidic foods should also be avoided. During family meals, make sure there is some form of food that is both easy and appealing for the EB child to eat. It is important to encourage them to participate in eating meals, even if only small quantities are consumed. Frequent feedings and snacks are needed to keep nutritional needs met. 5b. Supplements For many EB children, eating enough regular f ood to meet nutritional needs is difficult and supplements may be required. There are many ways to help boost caloric and protein intake as well as vitamin and mineral require ments. Carnation\u00ae Instant Breakfast\u00ae can be added to whole milk or canned supplem ents such as PediaSure\u00ae, Ensure\u00ae, or Nutren\u00ae, to name a few. These canned supplem ents can also be taken separately and are generally prescribed according to the child's age and nutritional needs. Fortified milk can be made by adding powdered milk to w hole milk. This can be added to soups, sauces, cereals, puddings and so forth, boosting th e calories, fat and protein consumed. If milk is not tolerated, other nutritional supplements may be recommended. Vitamin and mineral supplements may also be recomm ended by your dietician or physician. Be skeptical of any dietary regimen or supplemen t product that promises miraculous results. While these approaches are ofte n attractive to parents of ch ildren with chronic diseases, alternatives to a varied, nutritious diet can result in malnutrition. 5c. Feeding Tubes Even with our best efforts, it is often difficult or impossible to keep up with the nutritional needs of the severe ly-affected EB child. Placing a feeding tube into the child's stomach may be necessary. This procedure has been pe rformed with great success and has helped many patients improve th eir general health and healing. Discuss whether your child may benefit from a G-T ube with your dieticia n / nutritionist and doctor, especially a gastrointestinal doctor if possible. Children with G-Tubes can be fed throughout the night by way of a pump that slowly drips a controlled flow of formula directly into the stomach via the G-Tube. The placement of a G-Tube often seems overwhelming, but it can be truly beneficial and may be removed when your child no longer needs to have it. Section 6: Anemia Anemia (decreased oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood) is a common complication seen in all forms of EB. Ma ny factors contribute to the de velopment of anemia, the most common being chronic loss of blood and fluids due to blistering and open skin lesions. Limited diets and poor intake and absorption of blood-building substances also contribute to this problem. Iron supplementation may be an effective treatment for mild forms of anemia. More severe cases may require other medications or blood transfusions. In these cases, it is necessary to have your phys ician and possibly a hematologist (blood specialist) involved. Iron supplementation can significantly contri bute to the problem of constipation ( see Section 7 ). If your child is on iron, encourage him/her to drink plenty of liquids. Section 7: Constipation Constipation may be a difficult problem for children with severe forms of EB and deserves attention as a distinct complicati on. It is important to address constipation issues as soon as they arise. Severa l factors contribute to constipation, and its psychological implications should not be ove rlooked. Like the mouth and esophagus, the rectum is delicate in children with EB, and both it and the surrounding skin may have damage and open wounds. This leads to se vere pain during bowel movements, and children will then intentionally hold back from having a bowel movement, worsening the constipation. A combination of dietary modifications, psychological support, and supplements or medications will he lp your child avoid constipation. 7a. Diet and Nutrition A diet with a wide variety of foods from all food groups is extremely important. Include fruits, vegetables, whole-grain breads and cereals, dairy, meat and poultry products, and legumes. Most of these foods can be prepared in a manner that is tolerable to the EB child's fragile mouth and esophagus. Try to increase the amounts of food high in fiber, including vegetables and fruits, such as prune s, in your child's diet . Encouraging a high intake of fluids such as water and juice, is also a helpful way to reduce constipation. Soups are a wonderful way to provide many nutritious and high-fiber foods in a manner that is easily tolerated by children with EB. 7b. Supplements and medications There are many products on the market toda y for the relief of constipation. Your gastrointestinal doctor is a great resource for recommendi ng the appropriate supplement or medication, regarding your child's age, wei ght and individual problems. The use of supplements should be closely monitored so th at the child does not become dependant on them. When possible, use dietary modifi cation and fluid supplementation to try to correct the problem first. 7c. Physical activity Many children with severe EB become less act ive. This may contribute to constipation and other complications (see Sections 8a and 8b ). Whenever possible, encourage your child to walk, play, and be as active as their individual condition allows . It is better to have a child who plays and may get a blister or skin injury now and then, than to have a child who is afraid to move and ends up with a variety of other complications. Playing is a normal part of childhood, and while most physical wounds can be dressed and treated, emotional wounds are difficult to heal. Section 8: Additional Comp lications and Considerations This section briefly touches on some of the ot her complications seen in the severe forms of EB, especially recessive dystrophic EB. Although they are not common to all cases, it is good to be aware of these potential proble ms so that your child can be observed and monitored, helping to prevent them as much as possible. 8a. Contractures and Deformities Contractures are shortened, tight areas of skin, ligaments, a nd tendons that often lead to decreased function in an extrem ity. Decreased function leads to decreased use, or even nonuse, which also contributes to weakening or atrophy of the muscles. Keeping your child active prevents muscle atrophy and helps to slow the developmen t of contractures. Encourage your child to play and participate in normal childhood activities whenever possible. Swimming is a wonderful sport for EB children and is a good form of exercise. It may be necessary to let your child swim in his/her bandage s. This may actually make wound care easier, as it helps re lease sticking bandages, and the chlorine in swimming pools is a wonderful antiseptic. Normal ac tivities and playtime are also good for your child's mental health. Adequate bandaging, with extra padding at the knees and elbows will help avoid injury, and bandaging, especially of the hands, may also help prevent contractures. In some cases, physical or occ upational therapy may be necessary to lessen the complications of contractures. 8b. Fusion of Fingers and Toes (Syndactyly) Repeated friction, blistering and scarring betwee n the digits leads to fusing or webbing between the fingers and toes called syndact yly. This is often accompanied by down- curling of the digits as well. This type of scarring can be very aggressive and is one of the most debilitating effects of EB in terms of normal day-to-day functions. In the most severe form of syndactyly, complete encasement of the fingers and toes (mitten deformity) renders them useless. Although this is less critical on the feet, it is extremely disabling for the hands. While not always co mpletely avoidable, there are methods that may prevent or dramatically delay this co mplication. A method of wrapping the hands and individual fingers with tension in the web space is helpful. Important points to remember when wrapping the hands are to al ways wrap up the fingers from the back of the hand and to try to keep the fingers as st raight as possible during the wrapping. This helps support them and encourages them not to curl down into the palm. Using a 1\" roll of gauze, this task becomes simple and r outine with practice. Children will grow to appreciate the wrapping and th e added protection it provides. It is best to start hand wrapping at an early age in the severe dys trophic forms of EB. This helps make hand wrapping a comfortable part of your child's da y-to-day routine and will help slow or stop webbing before it has a chance to begin.

Eye Problems In certain forms of EB, partic ularly the dystrophic forms, th e cornea (the clear outer layer of the eye) and the conjunctiva (the muc ous membrane covering the eyeball and the underside of the eyelids) can be damaged. These tissues contain the same inefficient connecting fibrils as the skin and easily t ears and scars. For example, rapid eye movements that occur during sleep cause frictio n in the eye, especially if there is not enough moisture present. This results in sc ratches and/or tears of cornea. This is extremely painful and may take several days to heal. Similar to skin wounds, eye wounds may become infected as well. EB children with eye involvement may have excessive tearing or discharge from the eyes . A regimen of eye ointments or eye drops helps add lubrication to the delicate eye tissues . This is especially helpful at night. Antibiotic eye ointments are sometimes necessary if an infection settles in the eye. Patching the eye can be helpful when an injury to the eye occurs, but it is important not to damage the surrounding skin when securing the pa tch. It is advisable to have an annual check-up with an ophthalmologist if these problems are present. 8d. Dental Problems Cavities and other tooth problems occur in several forms of EB for a variety of reasons. Many EB children have their tongues fused to the bottom of their mouths, making it difficult for them to move food and saliva, a na tural rinsing agent, ar ound. This retained food is a good environment for the development of cavities. Avoiding sugary substances is recommended, but this is often difficult due to the need for high caloric intake. Another common difficulty of oral hygiene fo r all forms of EB is the sensitivity and fragility of the oral tissues. Gentle brushing with a very soft toothbrush or foam brush is highly recommended, but be especially care ful not to damage the gums and tongue. Fluoridated water or fluoride supplements are recommended. Regular dental care is important, but this must be extremely gentle . A dentist who is familiar with EB will better understand your child's needs. Tooth sealants may be helpful in preventing cavities, and this should be discussed with your dentist. 8e. Immunizations Immunizations are designed to prevent comm on childhood infections th at are potentially dangerous or deadly. These \"shots\" help keep our children healthy. Children with EB should handle immunizations as well as a nor mal child. Every child, including those with EB, should receive regular, scheduled immunizations. Section 9: Genetic Implications It is estimated that there are approximate ly 25,000 people in the United States suffering from one of the inherited forms of EB. There is also a non-i nherited form of EB that is caused by auto-immune damage to certain structur es in the skin, although this is not very common. The inherited forms of EB are caused by abnor malities in the genes that produce certain structural proteins in the ski n. A gene is like a blue-print or program that provides the information for how a protein is made. If th e information is faulty, then the protein will not work correctly. In the case of EB, faulty genes lead to proteins that do not hold the layers of skin together properly. In general, for every protein in the body, there is a set of 2 genes. For some diseases, only one gene needs to be abnormal to produce disease. These are called dominant disorders, and they may be passed to the child from an affected parent. Other genetic diseases, called recessive disorders, are caused by abnormalities in both genes of the set. In these cases, parents may be carriers of one abnormal gene, even though they do not have symptoms of disease. Affected children receive one abnormal gene from each parent who is a carrier of the abnormal gene. The simplex forms of EB are typically dominantly inherited. EB has both domina nt and recessive forms. The dominant forms of EB are more comm on than the recessive forms, which are typically more severe as well. It is important for parents of an EB child to understand that there is a significant chance for subseque nt pregnancies to result in another child with EB. The likelihood varies with the differe nt forms of EB, but in general, there is a 50% chance of passing a dominant form of EB to the baby, while for the recessive forms of EB, the chance is 25%. Unaffected brothers and sisters of children with a recessive form of EB may also be carriers of the disease. If this is the case, they could pass the disease to their children if their partner also carries an abnormal gene . Depending on the type of EB, affected individuals are likely to pass th e abnormal gene to their offs pring as well, resulting in a carrier or a child who is affected by that type of EB. Genetic counseling is strongly advised for families affected by EB who are considering additional pregnancies. "}
