Energy healing is a holistic practice that uses the focus of intention and compassion to remove energetic blocks in order to promote positivity and high vibrational frequencies. Energy healing has been shown to be beneficial in reducing stress and anxiety, as well as balancing and restoring the flow of energy in the body-mind. This type of healing is based on the belief that our bodies are made up of energy fields which can become imbalanced, causing stress, anxiety, and illness. Energy healing is said to help balance these fields and restore our body-mind to its natural state of well-being. Skeptical of how energy could possibly have an effect on our physical well-being? While energy healing is considered a pseudoscientific complementary or alternative medicine, there is increasing evidence that suggests it can be used to improve quality of life and boost the immune system.

There are many different types of energy healing, but they all share the common goal of helping to improve the flow of energy in the body. This is believed to promote overall well-being and quality of life. The practitioner uses their hands to assess the flow of energy in the patient's body. Once they have identified areas of imbalance, they use a variety of techniques to restore balance and harmony. When our energy is imbalanced, we may experience stress, anxiety, or illness. By restoring the flow of energy, we are able to improve our quality of life and promote natural well-being. Energy healing is not a traditional medical treatment and should not be used as a substitute for medical care.

If you are interested in exploring energy healing, please consult with a licensed and professional medical doctor like Dr. Guita Balakhane today.

Energy healing is a rapidly growing field that is merging quantum physics with biochemistry to therapeutically assess and treat energetic imbalances within the human biofield, which is also known as the human energy field. While quantum field dynamics are quantum mechanics theories involved in nuclear medicine and radiology, along with imaging diagnostics in biochemistry and biophysics therapies, they can also be used to treat disturbances within the subtle energy fields that maintain health and wellness. Through quantum physics, it is understood that at the atomic and molecular level, everything is in a constant state of motion, creating resonance. This helps to explain how energy healing can be used to effectively treat imbalances within the human energy field by restoring balance and homeostasis. While allopathic medicine focuses on treating the physical body, energy healing takes a holistic approach by also considering the mind and spirit. In addition to quantum physics, other theories such as biophoton emissions, signal transduction, and cell signaling communication are also being used to further understand how energy healing works on the cellular level. As research continues to explore the potential of energy healing, it is likely that this modality will continue to gain popularity as an effective complementary treatment for both physical and mental health conditions.
