Choosing a Primary Care Physician (PCP) A Primary Care Physician may serve an important rol e in meeting health care needs by providing or arranging for medical care for each Member. For thi s reason, when you enroll as a Member, you will be asked to select a Primary Care Physician (\"PCP\"). Y our PCP will provide your regular medical care and assist in coordinating your care. You may select yo ur PCP by calling the customer service phone number on your ID card or by visiting Our website at www.m ycigna.com. The Primary Care Physician You select for Yourself may be different from the Primary Care Physician You select for each of Your Family Member(s). You have the right to designate any Prim ary Care Physician who participates in Our network for this plan and is available to accept You or You r Family Members. If you do not choose a PCP, We ma y select a PCP for you.

The Referral authorizes the s pecific number of visits that you may make to a Pro vider within a specified period of time.

Y ou do not need a Referral from your PCP for Emergency Ser vices, but you do need to call your PCP as soon as possible for further assistance and advice on follo w-up care. In an emergency, you should seek immediate medical attention and then as soon as possible thereafter y ou need to call your PCP for further assistance and ad vice on follow-up care. In an Urgent Care situation a Referral is not requi red but you should, whenever possible, contact your PCP for direction prior to receiving services. You may also visit a qualified Participating Provid er for covered Pediatric Vision Care Services and P ediatric Dental Care Services, as defined in \"Covered Servic es and Benefits\", without a Referral from your PCP.

Claim Determination Period A Calendar Year, but does not include any part of a year during which you are not covered under this p lan or any date before this section or any similar prov ision takes effect. Order of Benefit Determination Rules A plan that does not have a coordination of benefit s rule consistent with this section shall always be the Primary Plan. If the plan does have a coordination of benefits rule consistent with this section, the first of the following rules that applies to the situatio n is the one that applies: The plan that covers you as an enrollee or an empl oyee shall be the Primary Plan and the plan that covers you as a dependent shall be the Secondary Pl an; If you are a dependent child whose parents are not divorced or legally separated, the Primary Plan sh all be the plan which covers the parent whose birthday falls first in the Calendar Year as an enrollee or employee; If you are the dependent of divorced or separated parents, benefits for the dependent shall be determ ined in the following order: o first, if a court decree states that one parent is responsible for the child's healthcare expenses or health coverage and the plan for that parent has ac tual knowledge of the terms of the order, but only from the time of actual knowledge; o then, the plan of the parent with custody of the c hild; o then, the plan of the spouse of the parent with cu stody of the child; o then, the plan of the parent not having custody of the child; and o finally, the plan of the spouse of the parent not having custody of the child. The plan that covers you as an active employee (or as that employee's dependent) shall be the Primary Plan and the plan that covers you as a laid-off or retired employee (or as that employee's dependent) Cigna HealthCare of Illinois, Inc INDHMOILd01-2022 Cigna Plus with Northwestern Medic ine 1250 Enhanced Diabetes Care MIHM0383 MIHM0384 MIHM0386 86 shall be the Secondary Plan. If the other plan does not have a similar provision and, as a result, the plans cannot agree on the order of benefit determination, this paragraph shall not apply. The plan that covers you under a right of continua tion which is provided by federal or state law shal l be the Secondary Plan and the plan that covers you as an active employee or retiree (or as that employee' s dependent) shall be the Primary Plan. If the other plan does not have a similar provision and, as a re sult, the plans cannot agree on the order of benefit dete rmination, this paragraph shall not apply. If one of the plans that covers you is issued out of the state whose laws govern this plan, and deter mines the order of benefits based upon the gender of a pa rent, and as a result, the plans do not agree on th e order of benefit determination, the plan with the g ender rules shall determine the order of benefits. If none of the above rules determines the order of benefits, the plan that has covered you for the lon ger period of time shall be primary. Effect on the Benefits Payable If this plan is the Primary Plan, the amount this plan pays for Covered Expenses will be determined w ithout regard for the benefits payable under any other pla n. If this plan is the Secondary Plan, the amount thi s plan pays for Covered Expenses is the Allowable Expense less the amount paid by the Primary Plan du ring a Claim Determination Period. If while covered under this plan, you are also cove red by another Cigna individual or group plan, you will be entitled to the benefits of only one plan. You may choose this plan or the plan under which you will b e covered. Cigna will then refund any Premium received under t he other plan covering the time period both policie s were in effect. However, any claim payments made by Cign a under the plan you elected to cancel will be dedu cted from any such refund of Premium. Recovery of Excess Benefits If this plan is the Secondary Plan and Cigna pays f or Covered Expenses that should have been paid by the Primary Plan, or if Cigna pays any amount in ex cess of what it is obligated to pay, Cigna will hav e the right to recover the actual overpayment made. C igna will have sole discretion to seek such recover y from any person to, or for whom, or with respect to whom, such services were provided or such payments made by any insurance company, healthcare plan or other organization. If We request, you must execute and deliver to Us such instruments and documents as We determine are necessary to secure the right of recovery. Right to Receive and Release Information Cigna, without consent or notice to you, may obtain information from and release information to any other plan with respect to you in order to coordina te your benefits pursuant to this section. You must provide us with any information We request in order to coordinate your benefits pursuant to this secti on. This request may occur in connection with a submitt ed claim; if so, you will be advised that the \"othe r coverage\" information, (including an Explanation of Benefits paid under the Primary Plan) is required before the claim will be processed for payment. If no response is received within 55 days of the reque st, the claim will be denied. If the requested informat ion is subsequently received, the claim will be processed. Medicare Eligibles If a Member is eligible for Medicare, Cigna will ca lculate the claim payment for Covered Services according to the benefit levels of this EOC based o n the allowed amount defined below, and pay this amount minus any amount paid by Medicare. Cigna wil l estimate the amount Medicare would have paid and reduce benefits by this amount for any Member w ho is eligible to enroll in Medicare but is not enrolled. In no event will the amount paid exceed t he amount that Cigna would have paid if it were the sole insurance carrier. Cigna HealthCare of Illinois, Inc INDHMOILd01-2022 Cigna Plus with Northwestern Medic ine 1250 Enhanced Diabetes Care MIHM0383 MIHM0384 MIHM0386 87 Under this scenario, the allowed amount will be the lesser of: The amount Medicare allowed; or Cigna's Negotiated Rate for a Participating Provid er; or Cigna's Allowed Expense for a Non-Participating Pr ovider.
