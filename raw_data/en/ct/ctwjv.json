Safety measures and regulations implemented in response to COVID -19 continue to vary by country. If you travel, we ask that you keep the following considerations in mind before , during and after your trip : Research country -specific entry and exit requirements , such as proof of vaccination status , COVID -19 testing requirements for both entry (e.g., research what test types are required) and exit (e.g., research what test types are offered and turnaround times) , quarantine and isolation guidelines, health screenings at airports and other transit po ints, etc. We recommend reviewing the U.S. Embassy website for the country you are traveling to for the most up -to-date requirements. Be aware of sudden border closures /lockdowns due to variant surges and potential flight cancellations caused airline staffing shortages . Purchase medical evacuation insurance and travel health insurance before you depart on personal travel (i.e. www.insuremytrip.com , www.squaremouth.com , etc.) . Carefully read all insurance policies to make sure they cover what you need, since there can be exclusions for epidemics and pandemics. Finally, confirm whether your destination's entry guidelines require proof of medical insurance -- some countries may require insurance coverage for COVID -19 infection (e.g., coverage for institutional quarantine of up to 14 days). Develop a personal emergency plan in the event that you test positive for COVID -19 while abroad. Prior to departure , investigate what the public health protocols are for isolation in your destination . In some countries, you may be required to complete isolation in a government facility . Write a list of reputable medical facilities equipped to treat COVID -19 near your lodging, local emergency contact infor mation, etc. (contact International SOS at +1 215 -942- 8226 for advice) . Carefully consider the impact of a prolonged absence, due to a positive COVID -19 infection while abroad (e.g., additional costs, work/personal responsibilities) . Health self-assessment: evaluating one's personal health risks, e.g., pre -existing conditions, age, etc. Be aware of societal restrictions and local laws in place regarding proof of vaccination for entry to restaurants and other venues, physical distancing me asures, mask requirements, in - country movement restrictions, etc. Be alert to local safety and security risks, including public demonstrations against government responses to COVID -19 and xenophobia towards international travelers . Transportation and Lodging: When making reservations be sure to inquire about safety measures (e.g. physical distancing, hygiene) that hotels are taking in light of COVID -19; and confirm availability of Ubers/Lyfts, local taxi services, and access to public transportation . Create a COVID -19-specific packing list , including masks, gloves, hand sanitizer, wipes, etc. Reflect upon ethical implications of traveling , taking into consideration not only possible exposure to oneself, but the likelihood of exposing communiti es whose local health system may not have appropriate infrastructure to adequately respond to COVID -19. Make sure your passport will be valid for at least six months after you return home and it has two or more blank pages. If an American citizen, register your trip on the State Department's STEP . (Smart Traveler Enrollment Program). If not, register with your home country's equivalent servi ce, if one exists. For visa holders: Due to the fluidity of this situation, we ask that visa holders contact International Personnel (212 -241-8300) prior to making international travel arrangements. Be cognizant of visa and passport processing delays, such as U.S. consulates and embassies suspending routine visa services and only granting discretionary appointments based on individual circumstances. Keep in mind that as countries continue to restr ict inbound and outbound travel, you can even be denied from returning to the U.S. , despite having an airline ticket. Lastly, we recommend viewing the following resources as you prepare for travel: Review International SOS' Membership Portal Page to look up global alerts, sign up for personal coverage , and build your own Country Reports . Visit International SOS' COVID -19 Website where you may access all articles under the Public Access and Members Access sections. Contact International SOS (+1 215 -942-8226 ) for country -specific advice related to COVID -19 concerns before, during, or after travel. Monitor travel advisories, health notices, and situation reports from the State Department , Center for Disease Control , and World Health Organization , respectively. "}
