When cytochrome P450 enzymes metabolize a toxin, it chemically transforms it to a less toxic form making it a water soluble substance ready for Phase II. During Phase I many free radicals are generated making antioxidants a critical component to a well rounded program. Phase II (conjugate) involves a process called conjugation. Conjugation may be defined as the addition or coming together of compounds in order to neutralize toxins, making them more easily excreted through the urine or bile. The major conjugation glutathione conjugation, and methylation.* Phase III (eliminate) is when the toxins actually exit the body. Colon health, digestion and overall intestinal wellbeing are intricately involved in the health of the detoxification process. The bacillus coagulans used in this formula are a vegetarian, dairy free source of probiotics providing five billion colony-forming units that support intestinal wellness and colon health to allow for a healthy elimination process.* Burdock is a source of insulin and mucilage offering a soothing effect on the GI tract.* As a prebiotic and fiber, Insulin supports the growth of friendly and healthy intestinal bacteria which supports good colon health and microbial balance in the gut during and following a detoxification program.* Urinary Tract Support is also covered in this formula as it too plays a role in the elimination process.* Uva Ursi Leaf Extract is most commonly known for its kidney supportive cleansing properties.* Stinging Nettle Leaf Extract is an herb that supports removal of metabolic waste for easy excretion through the kidneys.* Ingredients of interest include: LeucoSelect\u00ae Phytosome (Grape Seed Extract) is a proprietary technology consisting of low molecular weight grape seed extract in a highly-bioavailable complex.* Multiple clinical trials have assessed Leucoselect's\u00ae supportive properties.* Siliphos\u00ae Silybin Phystosome is a patented, version of milk thistle's active constituent, silymarin.* Siliphos\u00ae is so named because it is a combination of silybin and the phospholipid phosphatidylcholine, rendering it more bioavailable than regular silybin.* Curcumin C3 Complex\u00ae is an important liver health antioxidant.* It also supports bile production, thereby contributing to the elimination process.* The patented complex included in our product includes three curcuminoids: Curcumin, Demethoxycurcumin and Bisdemethoxycurcumin. Chlorella-Cracked Cell Powder is included in our formula because of its affinity for binding with heavy metals and toxins. Specifically, chlorella binds with mercury, lead and cadmium, making it one of the most popular detox supportive supplements.* We use only the cracked cell type, as nutrients will be available through the hard, cellulose wall only in this manner. To compliment this process, we suggest using our Organic Brown Rice Protein Powder which combines Acacia fiber and non diary probiotics to support the elimination phase and bacterial balance during and after the action of any serious cleansing regimen.* Supplement Facts Serving Size 6 Capsules Amount Per Serving Magnesium (as Mg Citrate) 100 mg Selenium (as Selenomethionine) 60 mcg Chlorella-Cracked Cell 1,000 mg coagulans 5 billion CFU DMG HCl 500 mg L-Glycine 300 mg Curcumin Leaf 4:1 Extract 167 mg Uva 4:1 Extract 167 mg Milk Thistle (Silybum marianum) Extract / Phosphatidylcholine Complex) 100 mg Alpha-Lipoic Acid 100 mg N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine 100 mg Other Ingredients: vegetable cellulose (capsule), vegetarian leucine, silicon dioxide.
