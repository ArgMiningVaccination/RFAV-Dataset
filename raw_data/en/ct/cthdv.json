Acupuncture In The News Acupuncture [Acupuncture Effective for Chronic Pain Management] [How Acupuncture Can Be a Valuable Addition to Medical Care] [Why Chinese medicine is heading for clinics around the world] A primary component of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture involves inserting thin needles into the skin at various predetermined touch-points throughout the body. By carefully selecting from over 2,000 touchpoints that link to 20 pathways it's possible to re-align the body's energy (known as its \"qi\") and restore it's natural balance (yin-yang). It's most often used for pain relief, improving circulation, stress reduction and treating a number of other conditions.

It's a completely safe, pain-free treatment, one that is just as accurate as traditional needles and has no side effects. Benefits include reduced inflammation, enhanced immune and cellular function and tissue regeneration. Electro-Acupuncture Electro-Acupuncture involves a pulsating electrical current through two needles. The added benefit is that the current can stimulate a larger area than a single needle by itself.

Some people can experience a tingling sensation at the attachment points, and this method should not be used on those who have pacemakers or a history of seizures, epilepsy, heart disease or strokes.

Cupping In The News Cupping Therapy [Cupping Has An Olympic Moment] Cupping is an ancient Chinese healing practice that involves soaking a cotton ball in alcohol and lighting it on fire inside a glass cup. The flame is extinguished and the cup is placed on the skin, creating a vacuum that draws the skin up, creating a seal against the body.

Herbal Teas, plant extracts, detoxifying supplements and essential oils are most often ingested, inhaled or applied directly the skin depending on the condition being treated. One of the primary differences between an herbalist course of action versus a conventional treatment is that herbalism is meant to view people as individuals and encompass their diet and lifestyle, as opposed to focusing on a single aspect of an illness or injury. The use of herbs is widely recognized around the world as being safe and effective for a variety of ailments. Kambo Detox Therapy Kambo is a traditional Amazonian indian ceremony that utilizes the naturally occurring secretion of the Giant Green Monkey Frog, and it has the rare distinction of being promoted as both a modern scientific treatment as well as an alternative therapy medicine.
