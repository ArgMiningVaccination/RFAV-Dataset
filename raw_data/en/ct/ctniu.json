Compliance with these guidelines is a condition of the Secretary's Approvals that authorise nurse immunisers and pharmacist immunisers to administer the COVID-19 vaccine. - Note: From 21 August 2023 registered Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health practitioners have been authorised via a Secretary Approval to administer COVID-19 and other specified vaccines under a written instruction and supervision of a medial practitioner, nurse practitioner or authorised midwife following the successful completion of additional training. Note: Public Health Emergency Orders (PHEOs) were enacted in 2021 authorising additional workforces to administer COVID-19 vaccines. These PHEOs were time limited and have now expired. - Authorised workforces must complete the [Commonwealth COVID-19 Vaccination](https://covid19vaccinationtraining.org.au/login/index.php)(in addition to any other immuniser training mandated for their role) prior to undertaking authorised COVID-19 vaccination activity. These workforces include: - medical practitioners - nurse practitioners (within scope of practice) - nurse immunisers - pharmacist immunisers - registered Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health practitioners. - Administering the vaccine The COVID-19 vaccines available in Australia require injection into muscle and are usually given into the deltoid muscle in the upper arm. Usually, people receive the same brand of vaccine for their first two doses with spacing of doses as recommended by ATAGI. Standard pre-vaccine and post-vaccine procedures will apply, including a checklist and a minimum 15-minute observation period following vaccination. It is recommended that individuals with a history of anaphylactic reaction to vaccines be monitored for 30 minutes after vaccination, rather than 15 minutes. Supporting documents and information to share with vaccine recipients can be found on the [Australian Government Department of](https://www.health.gov.au/initiatives-and-programs/covid-19-vaccines/advice-for-providers). COVID-19 vaccines can be co-administered (that is, given on the same day) with influenza and other vaccines. Check further advice for timing of other vaccines, including influenza vaccine on the [Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation](https://www.health.gov.au/our-work/covid-19-vaccines/advice-for-providers/clinical-guidance/clinical-recommendations#timing-of-administration-of-other-vaccines-including-influenza-vaccine)website. Informed consent is required before administering each COVID-19 vaccine dose. Consent can be verbal or written: Managing side effects Normal and very common reactions to vaccination include: - pain, redness and/or swelling at the site of injection - tiredness - muscle aches - headache - fever and chills - joint pain. Serious reactions like allergic reactions are possible but extremely rare. Advise patients to seek medical advice straight away if: - their body reacts in an unexpected way - they received the AstraZeneca vaccine and experience symptoms of [thrombosis thrombocytopenia](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/thrombosis-with-thrombocytopenia-syndrome-tts) - they received the Pfizer vaccine or the Moderna vaccine and experience symptoms of [myocarditis or](https://www.health.gov.au/initiatives-and-programs/covid-19-vaccines/advice-for-providers/clinical-guidance/myocarditis-pericarditis) - they have any concerns about potential side effects of vaccines. An immediate allergic reaction to a vaccine or medication includes any hypersensitivity-related signs or symptoms consistent with urticaria, angioedema, respiratory distress (for example wheezing, stridor), or anaphylaxis that occur within four hours of administration. People with an immediate allergic reaction to the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine should seek immediate medical advice and discuss the risk-benefit assessment and future medical support for further COVID-19 vaccinations with their health care provider. Vaccine providers should attempt to determine whether reactions reported following vaccination are consistent with immediate allergic reactions versus other types of reactions commonly observed following vaccination, such as a vasovagal reaction or post-vaccination side effects (which are not contraindications to receiving the second vaccine dose). In Victoria, clinicians must report severe adverse effects through [ATAGI has released](https://www.health.gov.au/our-work/covid-19-vaccines/advice-for-providers/clinical-guidance)to assist health care workers assess if their patient should receive the COVID-19 vaccine. COVID-19 and the Influenza vaccine Victorians are encouraged to get an [influenza](https://www.health.gov.au/influenza-vaccination)this year to protect themselves against seasonal influenza. This will help protect our health system and our most vulnerable populations. [The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation](https://www.health.gov.au/our-work/covid-19-vaccines/advice-for-providers/clinical-guidance/clinical-recommendations#timing-of-administration-of-other-vaccines-including-influenza-vaccine)advises that COVID-19 vaccines can be co-administered (given on the same day) with an influenza vaccine. ATAGI recommends it is acceptable to co-administer a dose of a COVID-19 vaccine that is additional to the primary course (third or fourth dose in some circumstances) with an influenza vaccine. - To reduce pain and discomfort at the vaccination site, people can: - apply a clean, cool, wet washcloth over the area - use or exercise their arm. To reduce discomfort from fever, advise people to: - drink plenty of fluids - dress lightly - take over-the-counter medicine such as paracetamol. Advise people to call a doctor or healthcare provider if: - the redness or tenderness at the vaccination site increases after 24 hours - their side effects are worrying them or do not seem to be going away. Advise people that side effects are normal and a sign that the vaccine is working.
