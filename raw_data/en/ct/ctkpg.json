With no available cure or treatment in place, and a vaccine still far from being available for public use, doctors are experimenting with a lot of different therapies and repurposing some drugs (such as dexamethasone, favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine) to treat COVID+ patients. In a new study, experts are now researching on the idea whether the novel coronavirus infection could be suspended through primary infection sites, such as the mouth or the nose, by administrating drugs to stop the attack.

The announcement was made by a Swedish life sciences firm, Enzymatica, who claimed that a mouth spray manufactured by the company, ColdZyme carries the potential of killing the deadly SARS-COV2 virus by a big percentage. The global infection toll for COVID-19 pandemic stands at 14.8 million, with over 6,00,000 reported fatalities. The news comes after the pharma company conducted pre-clinical trials of the medicine and found positive results against the disease. Sweden currently has over 78,000 active cases and nearly 5000 people have lost their lives. [readmore](javascript://) 03/6The study The company conducted several rounds of in-vitro trials wherein it was observed that the medicine, ColdZyme, used in the treatment of the common cold (caused by another type of virus) was able to disinfect the SARS-COV-2 virus and also provide protection against several kinds of other viruses known to infect humans. The anti-cold spray works by directly injecting the solution into the mouth and thereby focus on surface and local level virus contamination. The mouth administrated spray is made out of a composition of glycerol and Atlantic cod trypsin and builds a 'barrier' of sorts, preventing any bacteria or virus from entering, and lowering their power.

ColdZyme deactivated SARS-CoV-2 by 98.3% (1.76 log10) in 20 minutes\" The company's claim of a mouth injection, experts say, could be helpful in stopping and preventing mild to moderate level COVID-19 infections, considering the fact that SARS-COV-2 can stem off in the mouth and nasal cavities and start replicating in the throat, before attacking other vital organs in the body. The product under testing could work by decreasing the viral load of the active virus, and thereby, stopping any attack. [readmore](javascript://) 05/6Does it have any side-effects? It was also observed that the commonly used drug did not produce any sort of harmful side-effects or toxicity in the host body. \"Furthermore, no cytotoxicity was detected for ColdZyme at any dilution tested. The study was conducted by the US company Microbac Laboratories Inc - an independent accredited and certified laboratory,\" [readmore](javascript://) 06/6Could it help fight the pandemic? The company is very hopeful that their product meets all safety requirement and can emerge as a life-saving drug against the pandemic. Swedish officials are also asserting that since the mouth spray is a very commonly used product, there won't be many dangers if the product moves onto clinical trials fast. They also said that the common cold medicine could be helpful in rooting out other types of coronaviruses if brought into use. \"Even if the current in vitro results cannot be directly translated into clinical efficacy, it is very interesting that ColdZyme is able to effectively deactivate SARS-CoV-2 in vitro since it constitutes a proof-of-principle that can be taken further into clinical studies. Thus, the results indicate that ColdZyme can offer a protective barrier against SARS-CoV-2,\" a briefing by Claus Egstrand, Enzymatica's Chief Operating Officer read.
