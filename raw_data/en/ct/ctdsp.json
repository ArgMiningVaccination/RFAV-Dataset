Anthroposophy was introduced and developed by [Rudolf Steiner](http://www.anthroposophy.org/fileadmin/vision-in-action/being-human-2011-01-Amrine-Discovering.pdf), known for founding Waldorf education, biodynamic agriculture, and innovative social and economic models, among other initiatives. It is concerned with all aspects of human life, spirit and humanity's future evolution and well-being. Anthroposophy is not a religion, but is compatible with the world's religious traditions. We treasure and celebrate the diverse religious and cultural traditions of the members and guests of the House of Peace. The House of Peace is inspired and guided by Steiner's ideas and methods of social therapy and healing community, also embodied in Camphill communities throughout the world. We participate in the anthroposophical movement locally, nationally, and internationally, through lectures, study groups, conferences, festivals, and other activities. "}
