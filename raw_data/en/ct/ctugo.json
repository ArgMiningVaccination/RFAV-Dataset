As part of improving their patient care, fellows must be well - versed in inquiry: research, quality improvement, leve raging human and electronic resources, and applying research findings to improve patient care. The Scholarly Activity Pro gram (SAP) for CVD provides fellow s with a strong foundational skillset , ensuring their effectiveness in evaluating the care of the patient in terms of best practices and their proficiency in critical appraisal of peer -reviewed literature, which will help fellows develop a pattern of lifelong learning habits. Fellows learn principles of how research and Quality Improvement (QI) is conducted, evaluated, explained to patients, and applied to their patients' care. The Scholarly Activity Program is designed t o fulfill the fellowship program's Practice -Based Learning go als. Scholarly activities of fellow s and faculty are documented and assessed regularly as part of the Cardiovascular Disease Program evaluation and are also assessed through the annual Faculty and Fellows Survey. This executive summary is organized into three parts. In Part I, scholarly activity processes and structures are identified and described. Part II provides details regarding resources in place to support scholarly research activities. Pa rt III includes a list of recent faculty and fellow activities. PART I - Processes for Scholar ly Activity & Research The Scholarly Activity Program is administered through a variety of teaching strategies, including regular instruction through didactics sessions, engaged participation in QI or research projects , journal club, and presentations at fellowship -based conferences (M&M , Grand Rounds, etc). Fellows are also required to regularly submit scientific abstracts, posters and/or manuscripts to profes sional associations and publishers with the intent to present at conferences or publish in peer -reviewed journals. The sections below provide further details for each type of scholarly activity . Faculty Research and Scholarly Activity Cardiology faculty are required to demonstrate involveme nt in CVD fellow scholarly activity by pr oviding guidance and support to fellows and pa rticipating in clinical dis cussio ns and conferences. Faculty are responsible for commi tting and scheduling a portion of the ir time to supporting the schola rly activities of fellow s. During su ch time, faculty may provide direct consultation and advisement on scholarly topics, the research process, or provide ongoing guidance throughout a project's entire timeline. Faculty may also select peer-reviewed and clinically signific ant research articles for fellow s to revie w, appraise and present during journal club activ ities. Faculty are also responsible for the development and implementation of their own scholarly activities in order to expan d their own knowledge base and contribute to the body of literature in their specialties. To foster faculty intere st and engagement in rese arch, HonorHeal th offers a facu lty developm ent series as well as workshops provided through the ResQIPS program (see be low). In addition, teaching faculty will be required to participate in clinical discussions and conferences along with on- site faculty development and training. All faculty will be encouraged to participate in national and regional professional organizat ions. Grand Rounds Each academic year, the HonorHealth Academic Affairs d epartment sponsors a required bimonthly Grand Rounds series for all HonorHealth residents, fellows, and core faculty focusing on topics pertaining to the institution's clinical learn ing environment (CLE). These educational sessions cover a range of topics as defined in the ACGME Common Program requirements to ensure compliance and oversight of the clinical learning environment at both the institutional and program levels. Specific topics include patient safety event reporting and disclosure, fatigue mitig ation/impairment, well- being, empathic communication, just culture, scholarly activity, diversity/equity/inclusion in the workplace, healthcare disparities, and professionalism. Topics are revised each academic year based upon the clinical learning enviro nment experience and feedback from residents, fellows, and the sponsoring institution's academic affairs leadership. In addition, HonorHealth off ers several other Grand Round series (IM, FM etc) including a Cardiology Grand Rounds series . These series offer presentation opportunities for fellows and faculty in addition to lecture topics provided by local and regional experts . As of Spring 2021 the CVD series was approved to provide continuing medical education credit and opened to clinicians across the system in a live/virtual format . The series emp hasizes best practices of current options in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cardiovascular disease, while enhancing patient satisf action and outcomes. Case Conferences: Case conferences offer fellows a unique opportunity to pre sent and get input from their attending physici ans and other faculty members . Noninvas ive case conference series: A monthly series where interesting imaging cases are brought by fellow s for discussion. This includes pre -prepared case discussions with an attached review of literature and didactic s created by the fellows for input by the faculty. This series has broad attendance , including ECHO staff , because i t provides a unique opportunity to delve deeply into teaching images from recent cases (usually cases oc curring during the prior month) . Faculty and trainees are able to enhance their depth of understanding of the case and its broader applic ability to Hon orHeal th's patient population through robust discussion of both image interpretation and the applicability of all imaging modalities, primarily echocardiography , to imp roving patient care . Invasive case conference ser ies: A monthly series where both intere sting and routine catheterization/electrophy siology cases are presented by fellows and attendings for review. This conference started as a didactic conference created by the fellows with input from attendings, but has moved toward a series of interesting c ases. The fellows now have a separate cath eter conference for direct teaching. There remains a small didactic component with the case series \u2014 a ten to fifteen minute review of current literature and practice on a prepared case, but the series now focuses on an attending faculty discussion of imaging with Socratic questionin g of the fellows. This has broad attendance including catheter lab staff. Journal Club Journal club is des igned to e xpand skills in app raisal and assimilation of eviden ce from s cientific stud ies. It is a month ly, fellows -led, interactive session unde r the supe rvision of Core Faculty and faculty membe rs with content expertise relevant to the topics chosen for pr esentation. Reading assignments and participation are mandatory . Journal club activities are intended to assist fellows in critically analyzing their own care against the most up- to-date informatio n on diagnosis and treatment effectiveness. Cath Conference Series: Biweekly conference where a specific invasive topic is prepared by a fellow with facult y support both before and during conference. This series is designed to give a forum where simple and complicated questions can be asked by the fellows and where new and seasoned le arners are open discussion and question asking is encou raged. Conferences are run in a judgement -free way that allow identification of knowledge gaps or systems issues that , if unasked, could lea d to subo ptimal care . Mor bidity a nd Mortality Conference Fellows participate in interprof essional review of patie nt complications and discussion of action steps to prevent similar events in the future. C ases can include unexpected de aths, delay in care or diagnosis, procedural complication, avoidable medical events , or n ear miss events such as medication errors, lab events or errors, or failure to act. When appropriate Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is included as part of the discussion. Du ring each session, the goals, guiding principles and privileged nature of the discussion and materials are introduced. Format includes timeline discussion and identification of cognitive errors, systemic errors, and solutions based on scientific evidence . Sessions are directed and supervised by a Board -Certified physician and focus is on education and potential patient care or system im provement. The discussion is summarized, and a list of action items or best practi ces may be developed. ResQIPS Curricul um and Workshop Series HonorHealth has developed an innovative framework and curriculum called ResQIPS (Research, Quality Improvement an d Patient Safety) , linking education and support on research and QI/PS activities to scholarship , and with the intent of increasing scholarly projects and improving outcomes. ResQIPS is designed to support the advancement of research, quality improvement a nd scholarship for the network's medical residency and fellowship programs and, more broadly, across multi ple discipline s in the network. The ResQIPS learning objectives are as follows: Design a significant clinical question that aligns with the ResQIPS Framework Describe the steps involved in conducting investigator -initiated human subject research & prep are for IRB ap plication submission Use Quality data and tools to support practice or improvement initiatives Describe methodology and design considera tions for QI and Research projects Identify tools, resources and mentors needed to support research activities Develop a scholarly project Collect and analyze data Disseminate findings through local, regional or national presentations and/or through peer - reviewed journal article publicatio n ResQIPS didactic s include grand rounds presentations, faculty development sessions , workshops , 'snippet sessions' (short, 15 -minute presentations on a research topic of interest), ResQIPS newsletters, 1:1 mentoring ses sions, and statistical consultations. Fellowship/Reside ncy, Faculty and IPE projects are showcased to the organization i n poster and presentation sessions annually. Quality Projects & Teams All fellows are required to participate in a quality team and/ or a quality improvement project within the base hospital institution. Fellows complete CITI human subject protections trai ning at the start of their fellowship and are trained regarding the organization's policies and processes for reporting medical erro rs and near misses. Qua lity projects focus on quality measures, patient safe ty, efficient workflows, improved patient outcom es, or risk management. National Convention s and Conferences Fellows are expected to present a scholarly research project at a loc al, reg ional and/or national meeting . Presentations may include a published work, poster and/or podium presentation represe nting a research or QI project completed during their CVD fellowship . Presentations will be prepared under supervision of fellowship faculty and/or physician researcher. Fellows ' scholarly projects are frequently submitted to the annual \"Academic Excellence Day\", sponsored by the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix, which is designed for residents and fellow s and includ es poster and oral presentations of case reports and research projects . Selection of showcased projects is through a competi tive abstract selection process overseen by the ResQIPS Director and her team. Those selected compete in poster and or/oral presenta tion competition that is judged by UA -College of Medicine faculty and invited GME faculty from various organizations. Fellow s in a Teac hing Role Fellows have multiple oppo rtuniti es to pr actice and de velop th eir teaching skills . In addition to the teaching demands r equired from daily interaction with patients, f amilie s, and other health care profession als, fellows participate in leading interactive didactic sessions such as Grand Rounds or teaching a didactic session for one of the GME Residency Programs . Fellows also have opportunity to work clos ely with UA medical students , offering didactics and mentoring. Addition ally, faculty model and mentor teaching skills on clinical rounds, in didac tic sessions, throu gh committee work, and in near ly all aspects of clinical practice for whi ch they provide supe es to teac h and couns el patients. Th ese interactions are frequently supe rvised by faculty, offering oppo rtuniti es for feedback and improv ement . As fellow s advance, they are expected to take on a greater teaching role, includ ing teaching or leading interactive didactic sessions in the CVD or other GME residency and fellowship programs . Multiple tools are utilized to assess and provide feedback for improvement on skills at educating patients, famili es, students and peers. Facu lty provide daily, face-to-face feedback on fellow teaching and counsel ing skills. Fellows incorporate this real-time feedback into their daily practice. At the conclusion of each rotation, fellows are evaluated by facu lty in the six ACGME competencies, including issues releva nt to their teaching perform ance. Fellows revie w these evaluations at the end of each rotation. Medical students complete an evaluation form of fellows involved in their instruction. Fellow peers are periodically called upon to evaluate each o ther. Skills at teaching are included in this assess ment. Finally, the faculty advisors and Program Direc tor provide a semiannual Milestone review at which feedback from all these sources is provid ed. Fellows utilize this feedback to improve upon their teaching skills. Scholarly Research /QI Project All fellows rece ive didactic training from research faculty on research methodology, study design, biostatistics, appraisa l and appl ication of evide nce-based medicine, ethics in the context of research, developing research questions, and disseminating and presenting resul ts of research projects. Fellows also attend HonorHealth 's Research, Quality Impr ovement and Patient Safet y sessions (ResQIPS) which are collaborative, interprofessional event s planned by Academic Affairs, Quality, HonorHealth Research Institute, Nursing, Pharmacy and Library Services. Academic Affairs also subscribes to IHI Open School which offers QI and Pa tient Safe ty modules to th e fellows . Fellows are encouraged to complete these modules during their fellowship and may be assigned one or more modules for completion as part of their didactics requirements, especiall y if deemed relevant to implementation of their sch olarly project. SCHOLARLY RESEARCH PROJECT Fellows are required to be actively working on a QI or research project throughout their fellowship program with the goal to complete a scholarly research project annually . Projects must be reviewed and discussed with the pr ogram director, mentor/advisor , ResQIPS Program Director or a faculty advisor . Appropriate timelines will be determined in o rder to complete QI project or research. Program Directors will not sign off on promotion and/or program g raduation if QI or researc h projects are incomplete. PART II - Resources for Scholarly Activity & Research CVD Fellowship Program Resourc es The CVD Fellowship Program provides access to HonorHealth resources and cardiovascular -specific resources including the American College of Cardiology 's self-assessment program (ACCSAP) which covers the entire field of adu lt clinical cardiology and includes all ACC Board review c ourse lectures . Fellows and core faculty are also provided access to Cardiosource Plus whic h featur es a wealth of o nline resources, yearly highlights from ACC 's annual scientific session, guidelines, clinic al topic le cture s, tools and board preparation activities in general cardiology, adult congenital heart disease, heart failure, interventi and nuclear cardiology . Other program -specific resources include a Cardiovascular Disease Fellowship Resource guide (https://azhin.org/honorhealth/res cv ) tailored to the program and curated by the HonorHealth libraria ns, and which includes special ty ejournals and ebooks, videos and podcasts, links to professional organizations, and other CVD resources housed together in one guide for ease of access . Academic Affairs has purchased Bridge, a learning management system softw are for th e administration, tracking, reporting and delivery of educational course content as well as tra ining and development programs. This will off er additional resources and learning modules , most of which can be accessed \"on demand\" at a convenient ti me for bus y fellows and fac ulty. Implementation will begin in July 2021.

PGY 5 Improving utilization of Intracoronary Imagin g/hem hemodynamic testing and/or intracoronary imaging within HonorHealth by 15% through in person meetings with interventional ists to discuss intracoronary imaging tools and rational fo r use. Te lephonic follow -ups with pr oviders as needed . Rationale : Studies (FAME 2 trial, DEFINE FLAIR, iFR - SWEDEHEART) have shown favorable outcomes when percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) a re driven by intracoronary hemodynamic monitoring such as F ractional F low Reserve (FFR ), iFR (instantaneous wave free ratio). Recent trials like IVUX - XPL, Ultimate and ILUMIEN I and II have shown advantage of intracoronary imaging in PCI. Use of intracoro nary imaging helps to better define lesion characteristics, assess ang iographically indeterminate lesions, identify edge diss ection, define mechanism of stent thrombosis, detect stent under expansion, proper ly size stent and optimize stent deployment. Phase 1 R esults : Prior to this intervention , the rate of utiliz ation of these hemodynamic modalities were 47.57 % . Preliminary d ata from 08/2021 shows that the rate has now increased to 65.86%. This is an increase of 20.29% from last year. Bimal Padaliya, MD Phase one completed Data Collection from 4/ 1/ 2020 - 9/30 odynamics PHASE 2 Proposal: The second phase of this project aims to ensure that not only thes e tests are utili zed but are done well. The ULTIMATE trial investigat ors did show advantage of optimal vs suboptimal IVUS directed PCI. A significant reduction in 3 -year target vessel failure was observed for IVUS defined optimal vs suboptimal procedures. In order to ensu re optimal imaging PCI, we are p roposing starting real time intracoronary imaging consult. Bimal Padaliya, MD 1,2,3 Trivedi, R. PGY5 First Experience with Lotus Edge fully repositionable and retrievable transcatheter ao rtic valve Objective : Implement a retros pective review on Lotus (Boston Scientific ) TAVR outcomes in the bicuspid valve population treate d at HonorHeal th and analysis of implications for this population beyond institution Methodol ogy/Results : Single center retros pective review. Resu lts: At 6 months in both tri -leaflet as well as the bi cuspid population in this TAVR platform , there was no mild or greater paravalvular leak (PVL ). These results provide data re: ho to best t reat th is population within HonorHealth system a nd as a whole.

R PGY5/6 Physiologic Pacing Post TAVR for ock Branch ( LBBB ) Propos al: Single center prospect ive pilot study (50 patients) to assess the effectiveness of physiologic pacing in the post -TAVR population by comparing the outcom es of physiologic vs. standard right ventricular pacing . Rahul Doshi, MD 1,2 3 (IRB submission in process) Trivedi, R PGY5/ 6 Heart Failure therapy optimization using Zoll LifeVest remote monitoring Heart rate and biometric data Objective/Me thodology : Single-center prospective trial (100 patients) , comparing frequent heart failure GDMT optimization using Zoll LifeVest heart rat e and biometric data versus standard outpatient heart failure management. Through data collected in this pilot study , the researche rs hope to identify more efficient treat ment and to optimize heart failure management in this high risk population . Secondari ly, th e study results will facilitate early identification of the subset of patients who may most benefit from ICD implantation. Rationale : Utilization of remote biometric data to monitor and treat cardiovascular diseases has become increasingly popular g iven the ease, availability, and chronicity of outpatient monitoring. Improvement in heart failure readmission and cardiac morbidit y and morta lity in patients with close outpatient follow -up have been well proven. This is none more important than in the ac ute cardiomyopathy population discharged with a wearable cardioverter defibrillator . Despite best efforts a large number of patient s proceed t o require ICD implantation beyond 90 days . Mayurkumar Bhakta, MD 1,2,3 (IRB submission completed and pending revie w and approval) Akella, K. PGY4/5 Predictors of Increased Perioperative Cardiac Risk in Trauma Patients Objective /Methodology : Prospective pilot study to confirm trauma cardiac outcome predictors described in literature and propose a predictive point -based scoring system discerning cardiac risk in trauma patients. Rationale : Traumatic injury is a uniquely complex sub- group among surgical patients. The resulting physiologic stress commonly strains the cardiovascular system, predisposing patients towards c ardiac arrest and higher mortality. Studies investigating this suggest that trauma patients have a higher incidence of intraoperati ve cardiac arrest and at least twice the mortality of elec tive surgical patients. Despite this population being higher risk, standard perioperative cardiac risk assessment is used . Mayurkumar Bhakta, MD (IRB submission in process) Akella K PGY4/5 Convergent Procedure for Management of Persistent Atrial Fibrillation Objective : Pilot study to determine if a convergent hy brid ablation procedure is associated with favorable outcomes in persistent at rial fibrillation management . Rationale : Management of persistent atrial fibrillation is complex and genera lly fails to respond well to traditional ablation strategy using pulmo nary vein isolation. The convergent procedure is a hybrid atrial fibrillation ablation strategy involving the epicardial and endoca rdial posterior wall and pulmonary vein isolation, some times performed with concurrent left atrial appendage exclusion.

Curric ula inclu des edu cation focused on medication management, volume status, nutrition/low salt die ts, and heart fa ilure emergencies. Craig Peters, MD Interdisciplinary QI project with Nursing Staff 1,2,3 the ED within the HonorHealth System Project descripti on/Rationale : Project scope includes a review of the system process of ac quiring and uploading an EKG from start to finish, analy sis and optimiz ation of the process through quality improvement and systems engineering, with a goal o f achievi ng a sustained state of ED EKG upload time of less than 20 min from time of acquisition t o time in EMR, for 90%+ of all ED EKGs acquired. Teamed with Clinical Systems team for implementation. Data analysis continues to assess changes to system and impact o f these changes on EKG upload times.
