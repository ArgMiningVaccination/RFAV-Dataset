Inactivated [viral](https://www.rxlist.com/viral/definition.htm) [vaccines](https://www.rxlist.com/vaccines/definition.htm) are sterile biologic products that provide [immunity](https://www.rxlist.com/immunity/definition.htm) against viral infections. Inactivated viral vaccines work by stimulating the body's [immune system](https://www.rxlist.com/immune_system/definition.htm) to produce antibodies against specific types of [viruses](https://www.rxlist.com/viruses/definition.htm), and protect a person from becoming infected when exposed to these viruses. [In](https://www.rxlist.com/in/definition.htm) the case of [SARS](https://www.rxlist.com/sars/definition.htm)-CoV-2 [coronavirus](https://www.rxlist.com/coronavirus/definition.htm) that causes [respiratory](https://www.rxlist.com/respiratory/definition.htm) illness and has led to the COVID-19 [pandemic](https://www.rxlist.com/pandemic/definition.htm), vaccines do not entirely prevent [infection](https://www.rxlist.com/infection/definition.htm) but protect vaccinated individuals from serious illness and hospitalization from the [disease](https://www.rxlist.com/disease/definition.htm). Inactivated viral vaccines contain particles of [proteins](https://www.rxlist.com/proteins/definition.htm) or [genetic](https://www.rxlist.com/genetic/definition.htm) material from viruses. Inactivated viral vaccines may also contain substances that preserve and stabilize the vaccine, and enhance [immune response](https://www.rxlist.com/immune_response/definition.htm). Some viral vaccines are delivered in inactivated harmless viruses such as human [adenovirus](https://www.rxlist.com/adenovirus-drug.htm). Inactivated viral vaccines may be made from: - Surface proteins (antigens) of the viruses enable the [virus](https://www.rxlist.com/virus/definition.htm)to hold on to a human [cell](https://www.rxlist.com/cell/definition.htm), enter inside and replicate. - Modified [RNA](https://www.rxlist.com/rna/definition.htm)particles ( [messenger RNA](https://www.rxlist.com/messenger_rna/definition.htm)/ [mRNA](https://www.rxlist.com/mrna/definition.htm)) from the virus can enter [host](https://www.rxlist.com/host/definition.htm)cells and induce the production of viral [antigen](https://www.rxlist.com/antigen/definition.htm), which stimulates an [immune](https://www.rxlist.com/immune/definition.htm)response from the body. - Recombined [DNA](https://www.rxlist.com/dna_did_not_attend/definition.htm)material from multiple strains and subtypes of viruses, killed to eliminate disease-causing capability. The main component of inactivated viral vaccines is the viral antigen from surface proteins, DNA, or RNA fragments against which the immune system produces antibodies. If exposed to a particular virus, the immune system recognizes the viral antigen and fights infection by preventing the virus from attaching and entering into the host cell. Currently, inactivated viral vaccines approved by the [FDA](https://www.rxlist.com/fda/definition.htm) protect against viral infectious diseases that include: - Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), oropharyngeal cancers [Influenza](https://www.rxlist.com/influenza/definition.htm)( [flu](https://www.rxlist.com/flu/definition.htm)) is [H5N1 influenza](https://www.rxlist.com/h5n1_influenza/definition.htm)( [Avian flu](https://www.rxlist.com/avian_flu/definition.htm)) [Japanese encephalitis](https://www.rxlist.com/japanese_encephalitis/definition.htm)virus infection, a disease that the [brain](https://www.rxlist.com/brain/definition.htm), is spread by infected mosquitoes [Polio](https://www.rxlist.com/polio/definition.htm)( [poliomyelitis](https://www.rxlist.com/poliomyelitis/definition.htm)), a disabling disease caused by [poliovirus](https://www.rxlist.com/poliovirus/definition.htm) [Rabies](https://www.rxlist.com/rabies/definition.htm), caused by the rabies virus that is transmitted when bitten or scratched by rabid animals [Tick](https://www.rxlist.com/tick/definition.htm)-borne [encephalitis](https://www.rxlist.com/encephalitis/definition.htm)virus infection caused by a [flavivirus](https://www.rxlist.com/flavivirus/definition.htm) [Herpes zoster](https://www.rxlist.com/herpes_zoster/definition.htm)( [shingles](https://www.rxlist.com/shingles/definition.htm)), virus [Human immunodeficiency virus](https://www.rxlist.com/human_immunodeficiency_virus/definition.htm)( [HIV](https://www.rxlist.com/hiv/definition.htm)) infection that affects the immune system (pending FDA approval) How are inactivated viral vaccines used? Most inactivated viral vaccines are administered as [intramuscular](https://www.rxlist.com/intramuscular_im/definition.htm) (IM) injections into the [muscle](https://www.rxlist.com/muscle/definition.htm). A few viral vaccines may be administered as [intradermal](https://www.rxlist.com/intradermal/definition.htm) ( [ID](https://www.rxlist.com/id/definition.htm)) into the [skin](https://www.rxlist.com/skin/definition.htm) or [subcutaneous](https://www.rxlist.com/subcutaneous/definition.htm) (SC) injections into the [tissue](https://www.rxlist.com/tissue/definition.htm) under the skin. Inactivated viral vaccines are mostly one-time series of [primary](https://www.rxlist.com/primary/definition.htm) and booster injections, however, influenza injections are administered every year to prevent seasonal flu. Inactivated viral vaccines approved by FDA include: Children and adolescents - COVID-19 vaccine for: - COVID-19 disease prevention in adolescents above age 16 - COVID-19 disease prevention - Emergency Authorization Use (EUA) in children from ages vaccine, routine, and catch-up immunization - H5N1 influenza (Avian flu) immunization for individuals at increased risk of exposure - Annual flu vaccines that protect against seasonal influenza caused by multiple viral strains - Japanese encephalitis virus primary and booster [vaccination](https://www.rxlist.com/vaccination/definition.htm)for children at increased risk for exposure - Routine poliovirus encephalitis primary and booster shots Adults - COVID-19 vaccine [Hepatitis A immunization](https://www.rxlist.com/hepatitis_a_immunization/definition.htm)for anyone seeking protection and to those at risk for infection, preexposure and postexposure prophylaxis [Hepatitis B immunization](https://www.rxlist.com/hepatitis_b_immunization/definition.htm)for anyone seeking protection and to those at risk for infection - Hepatitis A and B vaccination - Routine human papillomavirus vaccine for adults up to age 26, and in special situations, for adults aged 27-45 years - H5N1 influenza (Avian flu) immunization for individuals at increased risk of exposure - Annual flu vaccines that protect against seasonal influenza caused by multiple viral strains - Japanese encephalitis virus primary and booster vaccination for individuals at increased risk for exposure - Poliovirus vaccine prophylaxis for individuals at risk for exposure - Rabies vaccine, preexposure and postexposure prophylaxis - Tick-borne encephalitis vaccine, primary and booster shots - Shingles vaccine prophylaxis [HIV vaccine](https://www.rxlist.com/consumer_hiv_vaccine/drugs-condition.htm)administered every 3 months in conjunction with [antiretroviral therapy](https://www.rxlist.com/antiretroviral_therapy_art/definition.htm)(pending FDA approval) What are side effects of inactivated viral vaccines?
