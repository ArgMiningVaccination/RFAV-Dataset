The great efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines has allowed for excellent individual protection against severe disease. However, immunocompromised patients, representing a population of several million Americans, are a notable exception. Severe COVID-19 infections among fully vaccinated, immunocompromised patients have raised significant concerns about the effectiveness of vaccines for this group. An observational study by Boyarsky, et al., validated these concerns: Of 658 patients who had received solid organ transplants, 46% developed no antibody response after two doses of mRNA vaccine.1 In an attempt to improve vaccine efficacy, a third vaccine dose was evaluated in two observational studies of patients receiving immunosuppressive medications after solid organ transplantation (including heart and heart-lung). Werbel, et al., studied patients who had received two doses of mRNA vaccine and were given a third dose of either mRNA or adenovirus vaccine.2 Among 24 patients with negative SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody titers after the second vaccine dose, 16 (67%) had no antibodies 2 weeks after the third dose. In a subsequent study, Kamar, et al., evaluated solid organ transplant patients receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine for all three doses. Among 59 patients with negative SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers after two vaccine doses, 33 (56%) remained without antibodies 4 weeks after the third dose.3 Conclusion: A three-dose COVID-19 vaccine regimen may provide protection for immunocompromised patients who have not had adequate immunological response after two doses.
