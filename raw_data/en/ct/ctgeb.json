You will need to send an email for an invitation because these supplements are prescription only and not available to the general population. You can order a superior multiple vitamin directly from Thorne. Pick Basic Nutrients V and take 3 caps twice a day. Use the code HCP1026880 What to look for... Dr Sapunar likes calcium and magnesium to be in the citrate form, and not carbonate and oxide respectively. Look for products that have activated B vitamins ( pyridoxal 5 phosphate) and that don't contain magnesium sterate. Usually a multiple vitamin serving size is 6 capsules a day to get decent amounts of the nutrients. Lastly, if you're going to use a non prescription supplement, Make sure the company has independent quality control. Too many supplements have lead or other heavy metals. They may contain inactive ingredients, mold, pestacides, or toxic forms like hexavalent chromium. (Like in Erin Brockovich). Why get prescription supplements It's true they are more expensive but don't skimp on your health. Most companies use binders and fillers, and especially flow agents that compromise the quality of your supplement. They add these ingredients for their benefit at your expense. Favorite brands are Thorne, Vital Nutrients, Pure Encapsulations, Metabolic Maintenance, Designs for Health, Klaire Labs. "}
