Traditionally, herbs de Provence gets crushed in a mortar and pestle or a spice grinder before using. So should you crush it before storing, or before using in a recipe?

This saves the oils from releasing prematurely, which makes the blend taste stale in the long run. Instead, combine the dried herbs in a small mixing bowl and stir together. Store it in a cool dark place for three to four months. Then, right before using crush it lightly to release the flavor. How To Cook With It There are many ways a home cook can use herbs de Provence. Some of these include: - Seasoning meat. Rub the herb blend on the outside of chicken, pork, or even some light fish to flavor it before cooking.

You can use this blend almost like adding wood for smoking. Sprinkle it onto the hot coals of the grill to cook the flavor and release it into what's grilled. - In liquids, stocks and soup.
