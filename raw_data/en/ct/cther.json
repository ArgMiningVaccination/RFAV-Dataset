There are two basic philosophies of chiropractic: - The body naturally seeks the proper balance among all its systems, which are meant to work together. - Proper structure is necessary for proper function. If a structure is impaired by injury or stress, its function can be adversely affected. For example, when the spine is not positioned normally, it can irritate the nerves exiting the spine. And when spinal nerves are irritated, they don't function normally and can affect the function of the tissues they interact with. This \"end-organ\" effect is the central interest in chiropractic care. The relief of localized discomfort at the point of irritation is also an objective of care. "}
