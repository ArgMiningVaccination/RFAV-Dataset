Oliviero Dawes* Department of School of Psychology, University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia Introduction Childhood depression is a significant and complex mental health issue affecting millions of children worldwide. Alongside emotional and behavioral challenges, sleep disturbances are commonly observed in children with depression. This article aims to explore the intricate relationship between sleep disturbances and neurocognitive functioning in children with depression. Understanding how disrupted sleep impacts cognitive processes can provide valuable insights into developing comprehensive treatment approaches for these vulnerable populations [1]. Depression in children often manifests as difficulties in regulating emotions and coping with stressors. Consequently, sleep disturbances such as insomnia, nightmares, night terrors, and restless sleep are frequently reported in children with depression. Studies suggest that approximately 50-75% of children diagnosed with depression experience some form of sleep disruption, contributing to a myriad of cognitive deficits [2]. Neurocognitive functioning refers to the ability of the brain to process and utilize information for learning, memory, attention, decision-making, and problem-solving. For children with depression, these cognitive processes may be affected, leading to academic, social, and emotional challenges. Common neurocognitive deficits observed in children with depression include impaired attention, reduced working memory, decreased processing speed, and difficulties with executive functions [3]. Sleep is vital for healthy brain development, learning, and memory consolidation. In typically developing children, quality sleep supports optimal neurocognitive functioning. However, the relationship between sleep and neurocognitive functioning in children with depression is bidirectional. On one hand, disrupted sleep may exacerbate existing cognitive deficits, while on the other hand; impaired cognitive functions can interfere with sleep patterns, creating a vicious cycle [4]. Impact of sleep disturbances on neurocognitive functioning During sleep, the brain consolidates memories and transfers them from short-term to long-term storage. Sleep disruptions can compromise this process, affecting a child's ability to retain and recall information effectively. Executive functions, which include planning, decision- making, and impulse control, may be impaired due to disrupted sleep, leading to challenges in regulating emotions and behavior. Sleep disturbances in children with depression can exacerbate emotional dysregulation, leading to increased irritability and mood fluctuations. Poor sleep quality has been linked to decreased academic performance and a higher likelihood of school absenteeism in children with depression. Sleep disturbances significantly impact neurocognitive functioning in children with depression, amplifying the challenges they face in various aspects of life. A thorough understanding of this relationship is crucial for developing effective interventions and support systems. By addressing sleep disruptions and cognitive deficits, clinicians, educators, and caregivers can enhance the overall well-being of children with depression, leading to improved academic, emotional, and social outcomes [5].
