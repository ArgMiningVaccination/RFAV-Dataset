Singapore citizens, permanent residents or long-term pass holders who have been recommended to receive the COVID-19 vaccine under the National Vaccination Programme, and who experienced a serious side effect assessed by a doctor to be related to the COVID-19 vaccination received in Singapore [1], may apply for VIFAP. [1] Using COVID-19 vaccines under the National Vaccination Programme which are registered under the Health Products Act or authorised under the Health Sciences Authority's Pandemic Special Access Route (PSAR). COVID-19 vaccinations received under the Private Vaccination Programme are not eligible for the VIFAP. Which vaccines are included under VIFAP? COVID-19 vaccines administered under the National Vaccination Programme and in accordance with the recommended dosing by the Expert Committee of COVID-19 Vaccination are included under the VIFAP. Currently, these include (i) Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty vaccine, (ii) Moderna/Spikevax vaccine, (iii) Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine [1], and (iv) Novavax/Nuvaxovid vaccine. COVID-19 vaccinations received under the Private Vaccination Programme are not eligible for the VIFAP. [1] Refers to Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccinations received under the National Vaccination Programme from 23 October 2021. What is considered a 'serious side effect' that qualifies for VIFAP? A serious side effect is one that required inpatient hospitalisation, or caused permanent severe disability, or was fatal. Persons who experience such side effects after receiving the COVID-19 vaccination may apply for assistance. All applications will be reviewed by an independent clinical panel for the severity and relatedness of the side effect to the COVID-19 vaccine received. How much financial assistance will be provided? Will it fully pay for the medical treatment attributed to the serious side effects caused by the vaccine? The amount of financial assistance provided is fixed and dependent on the severity of the serious side effect, as indicated in the table below. Pay-out will be based on the highest quantum eligible, and persons will be eligible for one pay-out only e.g. only $225,000 for death and permanent severe disability, regardless of hospital stay or treatment. | ||Type of Serious Side Effect||One-time Pay-out Amount | |1||Results in death or permanent severe disability ||$225,000| |2 ||Requires admission to High Dependency or Intensive Care, with subsequent recovery||$10,000| |3||Requires inpatient hospitalisation, with subsequent recovery| (Excluding visits to A&E, without subsequent inpatient admission) |$2,000| The VIFAP is a goodwill financial assistance scheme that is independent of existing healthcare financing and insurance schemes. The VIFAP provides an additional layer of financial support for patients who had suffered from serious side effects caused by the vaccine. The VIFAP is not meant to reimburse medical costs associated with the serious side effect. Individuals who experience side effects after their COVID-19 vaccination can continue to receive support through applicable healthcare financing schemes, such as MediShield Life and subsidies at our public healthcare institutions. Persons with private insurance may wish to check with their insurance provider on their coverage details. How do I apply for VIFAP?
