Compensation and Advancement of Women in Academic Medicine: Is There Equity? Arlene S. Ash, PhD; Phyllis L. Carr, MD; Richard Goldstein, PhD; and Robert H. Friedman, MD * Background: Women have been entering academic medicine in numbers at least equal to their male colleagues for several de-cades. Most studies have found that women do not advance inacademic rank as fast as men and that their salaries are not asgreat. These studies, however, have typically not had the data toexamine equity, that is, do women receive similar rewards forsimilar achievement? Objective: To examine equity in promotion and salary for fe- male versus male medical school faculty nationally. Design: Mailed survey questionnaire. Setting: 24 randomly selected medical schools in the contiguous United States. Participants: 1814 full-time U.S. medical school faculty in 1995-1996, stratified by sex, specialty, and graduation cohort. Measurements: Promotion and compensation of academic med- ical faculty. Results: Among the 1814 faculty respondents (response rate, 60%), female faculty were less likely to be full professors thanwere men with similar professional roles and achievement. Forexample, 66% of men but only 47% of women ( P<0.01) with 15 to 19 years of seniority were full professors. Large deficits inrank for senior faculty women were confirmed in logistic modelsthat accounted for a wide range of other professional characteris- tics and achievements, including total career publications, years ofseniority, hours worked per week, department type, minority sta-tus, medical versus nonmedical final degree, and school. Similarmultivariable modeling also confirmed gender inequity in compen-sation. Although base salaries of nonphysician faculty are gendercomparable, female physician faculty have a noticeable deficit(/H11546$11 691; P/H115490.01). Furthermore, both physician and nonphy- sician women with greater seniority have larger salary deficits(/H11546$485 per year of seniority; P/H115490.01). Limitations: This is a cross-sectional study of a longitudinal phenomenon. No data are available for faculty who are no longerworking full-time in academic medicine, and all data are self-reported. Conclusions: Female medical school faculty neither advance as rapidly nor are compensated as well as professionally similar malecolleagues. Deficits for female physicians are greater than thosefor nonphysician female faculty, and for both physicians and non-physicians, women's deficits are greater for faculty with moreseniority.

Female medical school faculty have not advanced to se- nior academic ranks and positions in proportion to their numbers in academic medicine (1). Reports frommany specialties and institutions have documented this sit-uation (2-8). Certain specialties have actually reported adecline between 1995 and 2000 in the percentage of fullprofessors who are women (for example, from 11% to 6%in emergency medicine and from 2% to 1% in orthopedicsurgery). In 2000, only 8% of medical school chairs werewomen, and just 8 of 125 U.S. medical school deans werefemale (4 of them were interim) (9). Nonnemaker (10),using data on all U.S. medical schools and all U.S. medicalschool graduates from 1979 to 1993, found that womenhad continuing slower advancement to senior rank andthat the proportion of female physicians entering academicmedicine declined (10). However, that study had no jobdescriptors or measures of faculty performance and thuscould not address the equity of these differences. Female physicians also receive lower nancial compen- sation, both in academic centers and in private practice (3,8, 11); Baker, however, in examining salaries for youngphysicians in all settings (those with 2 to 9 years of expe-rience in 1990) did not nd the 41% greater salaries ofmen to be inequitable. In his model, differences in self-reported hours worked \"explained\" most of the observedsalary difference, and differences in job characteristics, principally specialty and practice setting, accounted for therest (11). No large, detailed study in a nationally representative sample of institutions conducted across all medical schooldepartments (including the basic sciences) has exploredgender equity of faculty in advancement and compensationin academic medicine. Our study examines rich data frommore than 1800 male and female academic faculty in allmedical school departments at 24 randomly selectedschools. METHODS Study Design In 1995-1996, we conducted a national mailed survey (12) to examine the status of female, minority, and gener-alist academic medicine faculty. In the rst stage of a2-stage sampling plan, we sought 24 U.S. medical schools.Of the 126 medical schools listed by the Association ofAmerican Medical Colleges (AAMC) in 1995, we excluded6 schools outside the contiguous United States because theAAMC considered them to be substantially different fromthe mainland schools. In addition, to obtain reasonablenumbers of female and minority faculty from each institu-Academia and Clinic \u00a9 2004 American College of Physicians 205tion, we excluded 14 schools that had fewer than 200 fac- ulty, 50 female faculty, or 10 ethnic or racial minorityfaculty. Our 24 medical schools were randomly selectedfrom the remaining 106 eligible medical schools. The re-sulting sample of schools was balanced across the AAMC 's 4 regions of the United States and between public andprivate institutions. In the second sampling stage, we selected full-time salaried faculty members from the 24 schools by using the1995 AAMC Faculty Roster. The AAMC listed 17 434faculty at the 24 schools; 720 faculty were excluded be-cause they were in unique departments not found at othermedical schools. Of the remaining 16 714 faculty, 4156were women, 929 belonged to a racial or ethnic minority,and 869 were generalists. For each institution, samplingwas strati ed by the following: 4 areas of medical special- ization (primary care, medical specialty, surgical specialty,and basic science), 3 graduation cohorts (received doctoraldegree before 1970, between 1970 and 1980, and after1980), and sex. We randomly sampled 6 faculty in eachcell (school /H11003medical specialty /H11003graduation cohort /H11003 sex). The most senior graduation cohort cells were lled rst. When a cell contained fewer than 6 people, we n- ished lling it with faculty who were from the same school, specialty, and sex but who were more junior. To obtainsufcient numbers of minority, generalist, and senior fe- male faculty, we added all such faculty to the sample. Data Collection and Survey Instrument Our inclusion criteria required faculty to be full-time and currently employed at their AAMC-listed institution.We mailed 4405 surveys to sampled faculty, of which 1073were ineligible because they had left their institution ( n/H11005 512), were not full-time ( n/H11005510), had died ( n/H1100511), or had participated in the pilot study ( n/H110059). The remainder (n/H1100531) were ineligible for other reasons. Nonrespondents among the eligible 3332 faculty received reminder post-cards, follow-up telephone calls, and survey remailing,as necessary. Because of con dentiality concerns of the AAMC, we do not have further information on nonre-spondents. The self-administered questionnaire asked 177 ques- tions about faculty demographic characteristics, current ac-ademic environment and support, academic productivity,rank, and faculty compensation. The survey was pretestedby 45 medical school faculty at 3 institutions to ensure thatrespondents understood the meaning of the questions andcould answer them appropriately. The Boston UniversitySchool of Medicine Institutional Review Board approvedthe study. Definitions of Analytic Variables All reported data are from responses to survey ques- tions. Career \"seniority \"was calculated as the number of years from rst full-time faculty appointment (not neces- sarily at the current institution) until 1996. When the ap-pointment year was missing, year of graduation from med-ical school /H110014 was used in its place. For example, seniority equal to 25 years indicates either a rst appointment in the 1970 -1971 academic year or completion of schooling in 1967. We categorized race by using the AAMC classi ca- tions of white, majority, and 2 classes of minorities (13).Underrepresented minorities included black persons andmost Hispanic persons, and nonunderrepresented minori-ties included Asian and Cuban persons. Missing race wasimputed as white. Publications were speci ed as the career total number of any-authored articles in refereed journals;faculty who skipped this question were assigned a zero. Tolimit the in fluence of large outliers (for example, faculty reporting /H11022500 publications or 120 hours of work per week), we coded publications in categories (0 to 9, 10 to19, 20 to 39, 40 to 59, and /H1135060) and top-coded \"hours worked per week \"at 80. \"Chair or chief \"is a marker for being a department chair or a division chief in 1996. \"Phy- sician \"indicates faculty with a physician 's degree (for ex- ample, MD or DO). Faculty responses to a request todivide 100% of their time into 4 categories (clinical, ad-ministrative, research, and teaching) yielded (continuous)\"percent time in . . . \"variables. Faculty with missing sala- ries (3%) were dropped from salary analyses, and thosewith missing rank (2.5%) were dropped from promotionstudies. We used the survey data to classify respondents 'de- partments into the 4 prospectively identi ed types. \"Pri- mary care \"includes general internal medicine and general pediatrics, family medicine, and geriatrics; \"medical spe- cialty \"includes internal radiology, emergencymedicine, anesthesia, and psychiatry; \"surgical specialty \" includes general surgery and its subspecialties, as well asobstetrics and gynecology; and \"basic science \"includes pre- clinical biological science. Our outcomes were \"salary \"and \"promotion. \"We used the term salary to refer to all pretax 1995 -1996 aca- demic-year faculty compensation, including clinical pay-ments for the academic year (excluding fringe bene ts, moonlighting, and consulting) and rounded to the nearestthousand. We de ned the term promotion as having at- tained the rank of full professor by 1996. Statistical Analysis We used frequency distributions, means, and standard deviations to separately describe female and male respon-dents. We used linear regression to analyze salary and lo-gistic regression to examine promotion. In each model, weadjusted standard errors using \"school \"as a clustering vari- able. The following additional predictors were used in bothmodels: physician status, department type, minority status,chair or chief, school, seniority (either coded as a continu-ous variable or in 5-year categories to a maximum of /H1135030), hours worked per week, and number of career publications(coded in categories [0 to 9, 10 to 19, 20 to 39, 40 to59,/H1135060]). In modeling compensation, we also adjustedAcademia and Clinic Compensation and Advancement of Women in Academic Medicine 206 3 August 2004 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 141 \u007fNumber 3 www.annals.orgfor current percentage of time in research and teaching. However, we did not use these time-allocation variables topredict promotion because we did not know their valueshistorically. Because being a chair or chief is an outcomewhose use as a predictor is controversial, we also examinedthe effect of dropping this predictor. For each outcome, we constructed models based on both male and female faculty data and interpreted the sizeand statistical signi cance of sex-related coef cients of the model as measures of and tests for sex differences. Thismodel directly answers questions such as \"do women who are more senior experience larger de cits than less senior ones, and, if so, how much additional de cit per additional year of seniority? \"We summarized the de cits in promo- tion for women within a faculty cohort such as \"those with arst faculty appointment between 1975 and 1979 \"as follows. First, we suppressed the information as to whichfaculty were women and used the previously developedmodel to calculate, for each faculty, the probability of be-ing a full professor (effectively assuming that all facultywere promoted \"as if they were men \"). We then compared the difference \u2014the actual percentage of professors minus the predicted number \u2014for women versus men in the co- hort. If the women are underpromoted compared withmen, their difference will be negative, whereas the men 's difference will probably be close to, although not exactly,zero. Finally, we reported the risk-adjusted women 's pro- motion de cit in the cohort as the women 's difference minus the men 's difference. We tested for the signi cance of this difference by using a 2-sample t-test. The risk- adjusted women 's salary de cit was calculated and tested analogously. Because we believed that salary structures might differ for physician and nonphysician faculty, as well as for maleand female faculty and across department types (for exam-ple, basic science vs. surgery), we tested selected interac-tions among these variables for their potential importanceas predictors. Speci cally, we evaluated interactions of women by physician status, seniority, career publications,rank, and chair or chief, and interactions of physician sta-tus by seniority; underrepresented minority; department;career publications; rank; chair or chief; hours worked perweek; and percentage of time in research, administration,and teaching. We retained such interactions when theywere statistically signi cant at a Pvalue less than 0.05. We believed that full professorship would rarely be attained infewer than 10 years but that such promotion would besteadily attained during the subsequent 10 to 15 years formost persons who ever attain it. Thus, in our analysis, werestricted our modeling to faculty with 10 or more years ofseniority, included an interaction between being femaleand seniority, and, to capture the expected leveling off,added a \"long-term \"marker for faculty with at least 25 years of seniority. Finally, because Baker 's study (11) could be interpreted as nding that gender equity in promotion problems was solely a phenomenon of the prefeminist past,we tested a female /H11003long-term interaction for its indepen- dent value in predicting full professor status. If, in fact,women and men hired since 1970 have been promotedcomparably \u2014even though the older cohort of female fac- ulty did not fare so well \u2014this interaction term would be signicant, and its inclusion would cause the female /H11003se- niority interaction to lose its explanatory power. The testfor whether sex affects the probability of being a full pro-fessor for faculty with at least 10 years of seniority is basedon the signi cance of the indicator for female, whereas the test for a larger de cit for women of greater seniority is based on the joint signi cance of the female /H11003seniority and female /H11003long-term variables. We present the odds ra- tios, CIs, and Pvalues for the resulting model in Appendix Table 1 (available at www.annals.org). Salary models were also used to test coef cients for their size and signi cance and to examine differences be- tween expected and actual salaries for cohorts of women.The test for a gender difference in salary for nonphysicianfaculty in the rst year is based on the signi cance of the female indicator; the test for a difference in salary for afemale versus a male physician in the rst year is based on the signi cance of the female physician interaction. The test for an increasing gender difference in salary is based onthe signi cance of the female /H11003seniority interaction. We report the salary model, its coef cients, CIs, and Pvalues inAppendix Table 2 (available at www.annals.org). We used Stata software, version 7 (Stata Corp., College Sta-tion, Texas), for all analyses. Role of the Funding Sources The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation funded the study but had no role in its design, conduct, or reportingor in the decision to submit the manuscript for publica-tion. RESULTS Characteristics of the Faculty Sample The 1814 respondents represent a response rate of ap- proximately 60% for both male and female faculty ( Table 1 ). Because of the strati ed sampling, male and female respon- dents were similarly distributed by department, region ofthe country, and public -private status of their school. However, although we oversampled women who were se-nior faculty, female respondents were somewhat younger(mean age, 45 years vs. 47 years), more junior (only 31%of women vs. 38% of men had at least 15 years of careerseniority), and less likely to be full professors (22% vs.35%). Racial distributions were similar for men andwomen. Advancement to Full Professorship In unadjusted analyses, female faculty were less likely to be full professors than men of similar credentials ( Table 2 ). For example, 66% of men with 15 to 19 years of seniority(that is, those rst hired between 1976 and 1980) but onlyAcademia and Clinic Compensation and Advancement of Women in Academic Medicine www.annals.org 3 August 2004 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 141 \u007fNumber 3 20747% of such women were full professors. Table 2 also reveals that within each seniority cohort, female facultywere less likely than male faculty to have at least 40 pub-lications; this nding emphasizes the importance of adjust- ing for such differences when examining equity. However,multivariable analysis also found substantial inequities inadvancement for senior faculty women.In the analysis for advancement ( Appendix Table 1 , available at www.annals.org), the only interac- tion was female /H11003seniority (odds ratio, 0.90; P/H110050.003), which suggests that each additional year of seniority was ofsubstantially less value to women than to men in improv-ing the chance of being a full professor. Underrepresentedminority faculty were also less likely to have been pro-moted. In contrast, each of the following made full profes-sorship more likely: being in a basic science department,having more career publications, being chair of a depart-ment or chief of an academic division, and working morehours. Three variations on this model yielded very similarodds ratio estimates (0.88 to 0.90) for the female /H11003senior- ity interaction: 1) retaining only those 435 faculty with 10to 20 years seniority; 2) adding a female /H11003long-term marker ( /H1135025 years), which was not signi cant ( P/H110220.2); and 3) dropping \"chair or chief \"as a predictor. The cohort analysis (shown in the rightmost columns ofTable 2 ) show the largest de cits in advancement for women among faculty hired before 1965 (44%), but nota-ble de cits (22%) also persist for those hired as recently as 1970 to 1974. Compensation In the compensation analysis, the professional predic- tors of salary were having seniority (nearly $11 000 in an-nual compensation for each 10 years of seniority); havingpublications (for example, 40 publications added about$20 000 and 60 publications added /H11022$30 000); being a physician (worth $43 000) and, especially, a physician in amedical or surgical specialty (worth, respectively, /H11022$20 000 and/H11022$50 000 more than the salary of nonphysicians in any department or physicians in primary care or basic sci-ences); being a chair or chief (worth $22 000); and work-ing more hours (an 80-hour work week yielded almost$22 000 more than a 40-hour work week). In addition,each 10% of time spent in research was associated with a$3000 reduction in compensation for nonphysicians and a$7000 reduction for physicians, and each 10% of timespent in teaching (as opposed to clinical or administrativework) was associated with an almost $4000 reduction incompensation. Some differences were not based on profes-sion: Female physicians received nearly $12 000 less thanmale physicians; women received almost $5000 less addi-tional salary than men for each 10 years of seniority; andnonunderrepresented minority faculty received $7000 lessthan majority faculty. The model predicts, for example,that a white male primary care physician faculty with fewerthan 10 publications will earn $96 214 in his rst year; if he were a medical specialist, he would earn $116 003. Asimilarly situated female in either scenario will earn$11 691 less. With 10 years 'seniority, the gender de cit increases by $4850 to $16 541. The female /H11003seniority decit shrinks (from $485 to $410 per year) in a sensitivity analysis that excluded faculty with 30 or more years ofseniority (50 men and 25 women), and dropping \"chair \"Table 1.

Because sampling was strati ed by school, sex, senior- ity, and department and was augmented to enhance numbers of senior facultywomen and minority faculty, respondent percentages do not re flect national dis- tributions of these characteristics for academic medical faculty.Academia and Clinic Compensation and Advancement of Women in Academic Medicine 208 3 August 2004 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 141 \u007fNumber 3 www.annals.orgas a predictor increases the magnitude of the female/H11003seniority and female /H11003physician estimated def- icits (to /H11002$568 and 738, respectively). The cohort analysis ( Table 3 ) also suggests that the women 'sd ecit is larger for women of more senior faculty rank, especially those hired before 1975. However, it alsonds female salary de cits in every cohort, including a par- ticularly large one among faculty hired since 1990. Ananalogous analysis found the salaries of female chairsand chiefs to be $17 800 less than those of male peers(P/H110210.001). DISCUSSION Our study con rms earlier ndings that women in academic medicine have not reached senior academic ranksin proportion to their representation in medical school fac-ulties. By considering and accounting for important pro-fessional characteristics (including number of career peer-reviewed publications) that independently affect facultyadvancement, we have shown that women are signi cantly less likely to be full professors than comparably creden-tialed men. This is more than a pipeline phenomenon.Although ample numbers of women have entered academicmedicine for at least the past 2 decades, the representationof women among full professors was only slightly higher in 1998 than in 1978 (10.5% vs. 7%) (14). Our study found substantial de cits in academic rank for women, notably within cohorts whose rst full-time appointment occurred between 1970 and 1985 and forwomen who became faculty before 1970. Although a fewinstitutions have documented progress (15), most studiesof women in academic medicine continue to nd gender disparity in academic rank (1, 3, 16). Nonnemaker foundfemale de cits in advancement in 15 consecutive national cohorts of academic faculty from 1979 to 1993; however,she did not have data on academic productivity, job char-acteristics, and performance to examine equity (10). Stud-ies that have had such data have often been limited to 1department or to 1 medical school (3 -6, 15). Tesch and colleagues (16) conducted a national study and adjustedfor important variables. In their study, 400 faculty hired inthe 1980s from across the United States revealed issueswith promotion similar to those found in our study, butthey did not evaluate salary. We were able to examinefaculty in all major medical school academic departments(basic science and clinical) and to account for importantindependent predictors of advancement, including num- bers of peer-reviewed publications, hours worked per week,Table 2.

Even after adjustment for these potential con-founders, a concerning lack of equity in promotion to fullprofessorship by sex remained. Usual explanations for the scarcity of female full pro- fessors, other than simple discrimination, include women 's lower motivation (17 -19), their lack of mentorship (1, 20-23), sexual harassment (24 -26), greater family respon- sibilities (20, 27, 28), less institutional support (6, 7), andthe cumulative burden of many microinequities (29).However, most of these alternative explanations are notviable here. We found women to have similar motivation(30) and similar mentoring (31) as male faculty, and wedid not nd that gender bias or sexual harassment had noticeably affected academic productivity (12). Family re-sponsibilities, however, did differentially weigh on femalefaculty, affect their academic productivity, and contributeto greater time to attaining senior rank (32). However,productivity differences do not fully explain the advance-ment de cit for women; at all levels of productivity, women are less likely to be full professors than are theirmale peers. Equity in compensation has been equally problematic for female medical school faculty (3, 8), although 1 study(11) purported to show equity in compensation amongrecent graduates. However, as that cohort has aged, ourstudy found increasing de cits. We found greater de cits for all female faculty with increasing years of seniority. Forfemale physician faculty, in contrast to nonphysician fac-ulty, we found a large additional de cit (/H11002$11 691; P/H11005 0.01). Others have found that the overall earnings differ-ential between male and female physician faculty narrowedin the 1970s and 1980s (24% in 1972 [33], 19% in 1977[34], and 15% in 1982 [35]) but did not disappear. Dif-ferences in specialty and practice style explain some of thesalary de cits for women, as do differences in seniority, hours worked, and numbers of peer-reviewed publications(36). However, after adjustment for these and other facultycharacteristics, female physician faculty are paid less thantheir male peers, and both physician and nonphysicianfemale faculty experience greater de cits with greater se- niority. We also found a signi cant salary de cit for non- underrepresented minority faculty. We note that including a \"chief or chair \"indicator in models accepts women 's lesser representation in leadership positions (13% vs. 21%) as a legitimate explanation forwomen 's lower rank or salary. However, being passed over for a leadership position may be part of the same processthat leads a woman to advance more slowly and be paidless than her male peers. The discrimination literatureviews variables that capture real differences in responsibilitybut may re flect discriminatory allocations as \"tainted \"(37). Dropping this variable had minimal effect on the promo-tion analysis but increased the estimated size of the salarydecit for women by about 17%. In addition, we found that female chairs and chiefs received $14 000 less thanexpected; this nding was based on the relations between professional characteristics and salary identi ed for their male peers. Salary equity by sex or race is a legal as well as an ethical issue for employers. Pay discrepancies, typically as-sociated with lower initial placement and slower promo-tions, have been found in successful gender discriminationlawsuits at universities (38). After accounting for the majorprofessional factors that affect salary and advancement,substantial de cits for women and minorities remain; it is not obvious that additional legitimate factors, rather thandiscrimination, can account for these discrepancies. Thegender de cits in both advancement and compensation are greater for women in more senior faculty positions. Our ndings in both advancement and salary parallel those of other studies in business, law, and academia (39).Starting salaries by sex for persons with an MBA, if expe-rience is taken into account, tend to be approximatelyequal, but advancement for women is slower and salariesbecome increasingly disparate (39). In the profession oflaw, whether in private rms, corporations, or the judi- ciary, women are overrepresented in junior positions, areunderrepresented in senior positions, and have lower sala-ries (39). Others have found the picture in academia to bethe same and similar to our ndings for academic medical faculty. The most recent female graduates start with salariessimilar to those of their male colleagues, but by 3 to 8 yearsafter a degree is earned, salary disparities appear and thenincrease with greater seniority. Gender differences in salaryin science and engineering are greater than in the human-ities. Overall, salary data for universities and colleges showalmost no reduction of gender disparities between 1980and 1996 (39). The issues for women in science rather than medical academia are somewhat different; the \"leaky pipeline \"phe- nomenon is more potent here than in medical schools.Although nearly half (47%) of bachelor degrees in the sci-ences are awarded to women, only 38% of enrollees ingraduate school in the sciences are women, and just 31%of PhDs in 1995 were awarded to women (40). In medi-cine, 40% of graduates are women, and, until recently,women have entered academia in higher proportion thantheir male colleagues (10). The cause of this decline inwomen entering medical academia over the past severalyears is unknown but could re flect resident and fellow awareness of the obstacles faced by female faculty. Our work has limitations. Overall quality of academic performance is not fully captured by even our extensivedata. However, there is no particular reason to believe thatbetween 2 faculty of opposite sex with, for example, 50publications each, legitimate \"unmeasured factors, \"rather than gender-biased judgments, systematically favor theman. Although we have detailed data on many factors thatmay be associated with promotion, such as seniority andspecialty, these data are self-reported; however, no evidenceshows that any biases would be gender speci c. Clearly, Academia and Clinic Compensation and Advancement of Women in Academic Medicine 210 3 August 2004 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 141 \u007fNumber 3 www.annals.orgnumber of peer-reviewed publications does not capture quality; however, promotion criteria are often (either for-mally or informally) linked to numerical \"quotas. \"In ad- dition, we have accounted for many other important fac-tors that might affect rank, such as allocation ofprofessional time, hours worked per week, seniority, andspecialty. Our information on compensation is also by self- report. However, we have no reason to suspect systematicdifferences by sex or other faculty descriptors in reportingprofessional income. One limitation is that signi cant dif- ferences in income can arise for faculty in the same surgicalspecialty if some faculty do fewer procedures. We have nodata that speak to the existence, magnitude, or direction ofsuch a difference by sex. Our study is cross-sectional; thus, we know nothing about former faculty and whether men and women mayhave left in different numbers or for different reasons.Moreover, such data do not allow us to distinguish senior-ity from cohort effects. For example, we cannot say thatthe faculty hired since 1980, for whom no gender differ-ences in promotion were apparent in 1996, are still subjectto the same forces that led women hired in 1970 to expe-rience a promotion de cit by 1996. A de nitive answer to this question will not be available until after 2006. How-ever, the fact that Baker (11) found gender equity in 1990salaries for faculty hired within the preceding 10 yearscombined with our nding of salary inequities in 1996 for that cohort 6 years later suggests that gender inequitiesaccrue over the course of a career. In the absence of cor-rective action, the gender inequities will probably continueto widen for current faculty as they become more senior.We do not know the level of academic productivity beforepromotion or productivity at the time of promotion, butwe do know which faculty had not yet been promoted eventhough they had produced the number of publications re-ported. Although 60% is a respectable response rate for a lengthy questionnaire administered to a nationally dis-persed sample of academic physicians, nonresponders aresufciently numerous that response bias could affect nd- ings. Finally, our data are not as recent as we would wish(1995 -1996); however, similarly rich, more recent data do not exist and data from the AAMC suggest that the gendergap in salaries persists. Thus, we believe that this studyprovides the best available data to address a very importantissue. Our work has many strengths. To our knowledge, it is therst study across all medical school departments, in- cluding clinical and basic science departments, in a na-tional sample of medical schools to examine many keyfactors that affect academic advancement and compensa-tion for men and women. Despite an adequate pipeline inacademic medicine and suf cient years for women to achieve full professor rank, we found less advancement tofull professor rank and lower salaries for women. Particu-larly in view of the decline in the numbers and proportion of women entering academic medicine (10), as well as thegreater decrease in interest in an academic career forwomen compared with men during residency (41), medicalschools should closely examine their environment for gen-der equity in promotion and compensation.

W-44 3 August 2004 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 141 Number 3 www.annals.orgCan We Use Automated Data to Assess Quality of Hypertension Care? Ann M. Borzecki, MD, MPH; Ashley T. Wong, MA; Elaine C. Hickey, RN, MS; Arlene S. Ash, PhD; and Dan R. Berlowitz, MD, MPH Objective: To determine whether extractable blood pressure (BP) information available in a computerized patient record system (CPRS) could be used to assess quality of hypertension care inde\u00ad pendently of clinicians' notes. Study Design: Retrospective cohort study of a random sample of hypertensive patients from 10 Department of Veterans Affairs r:vA) sites across the country. Methods: We abstracted BPs from electronic clinicians' notes for all medical visits of 981 hypertensive patients in 1999. We compared these with BP measurements available in a separate vitals signs file in the CPRS. We also evaluated whether assess\u00ad ments of performance varied by source by using patients' last doc\u00ad umented BP reading. Results: When the vital signs file and notes were combined, a BPmeasurement was taken for 71% of 6097 medical visits; 60% had a BP measurement only in the vital signs file. Combining sources, 43% of patients had a BP reading of less than 140190 mm Hg; by site this varied (34%-51%). Vital signs file data alone yielded similar findings; site rankings by rates of BP control changed minimally. Conclusions: Current performance review programs collect clinical data from both clinicians' notes and automated sources as available. However, we found that notes contribute little informa\u00ad tion with respect to BP values beyond automated data alone. The VA's vital signs file is a prototypical automated data system that could make assessment of hypertension care more efficient in many settings. (Am J Manag Care. 2004;10:473-479) Obtaining valid data describing processes and outcomes of care is central to quality assess\u00ad ment and improvement. Traditionally, such data could be obtained from a variety of sources includ\u00ad ing administrative databases, medical records, and patient surveys. Administrative databases contain infor\u00ad mation typically collected for billing purposes or to track utilization, including demographics, diagnoses, and procedure codes. Such databases allow cost-effi\u00ad cient study of large numbers of cases but lack the clini\u00ad cally detailed information available from medical reoords.!\" Increasingly though, detailed infor\u00ad mation such\" as 'sIgtis\"oacii' are\"\" becoming incorporated into comprehensive informa\u00adtion systemsr''\" The completeness and accuracy of these data systems are often in quesnon.V' Consequently, assessment of their validity remains necessary. Hypertension is an important condition whose treat\u00ad ment is in need of quality Improvement,\" It affects more than SO million Americans and more than 1 million vet\u00ad 8erans. ,9 Despite readily available, effective therapy for lowering blood pressure (BP) and preventing cardiovas\u00ad cular morbidity and mortalityB,I0-12 most patients with hypertension have inadequate BP eontrol.13-1 8 In the 1999-2000 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 69% of patients with a diagnosis of hypertension had a BP reading greater than or equal to 140/90 mm Hg.8 Further, several studies have shown that despite reported familiarity and agreement with national hyper\u00ad tension guidelines, clinicians tolerate higher BPs than are recornmended. 13,19-zl Improving hypertension care requires ongoing assessment. Unadjusted BP control is the only Widely used measure to assess hypertension care, used by both the Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDlS) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) performance review program.2Z,ZJ Unlike many other performance indicators that involve first examining automated data and then reviewing the medical chart if data are not available, hypertension assessment has tra\u00ad ditionally relied solely on chart review.\" This is at least in part because BP data may be recorded by several individuals. In most ambulatory clinics, a nurse takes an initial BP and documents this reading in an intake note. Clinicians may then do additional BP measure\u00ad ments, which are documented in their medical notes.

VOL. 10, NO.7 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MANAGED CARE 473 CLINICAL For those settings with computerized patient record systems (CPRS), the initial vital signs information recorded by the nurse also may be entered into a sepa\u00ad rate data field of the record, which may then be readily extracted. In previous work, we found that only 1 BP reading was taken at most Visits, which usually was present in the nurse's intake note.\" In a setting where this infonnation is entered directly into the computer\u00ad ized record, it is unknown how much information would be lost by examining only these automated vital signs data, and whether using only these data would impact quality measurement. The current study compares the availability and agreement of BP measurements from an extractable data field of the CPRS with BP measurements obtained from clinicians' notes. We address the following 3 questions: 1. How complete is the automated BP information? 2. What factors arc associated with discrepancies between the automated data and the clinicians' notes? 3. How do judgments about the quality of hyperten\u00ad sion care vary based on the data sources used? Lessons learned from our experience may be useful to other researchers and individuals interested in meas\u00ad uring healthcare quality. METHODS This is a retrospective cohort study that analyzed VA databases. The VA, as the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States, provides care to more than 4 million veterans and is considered to be a leader in establishing \"a multifunctional integrated electronic medical record system.\"25.27 Study Subjects and Sites We identified individuals with hypertension who were receiving regular outpatient medical care at 10 VAsites across the country during 1999. (A site comprises a hos\u00ad pital-based outpatient clinic and associated community\u00ad based outpatient clinics.) Selected sites had been entering BP measurements into a separate vital signs file of the CPRS and using electronic clinicians' notes for medical clinics, both as of at least January 1, 1999. We used a national administrative VA database, the OutPatient Clinic file, to identify eligible subjects. To be eligible, patients needed to have at least 1 OutPatient Cllnio-Iisted .. hypertension diagnosis . (lnt;':n'ational Cla;sij{cation Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM] code 401, 402 or 405) in 1998 and to be regular VA users (ie, ~ OutPatient Clinic-listed medical clinic visits at least 6 months apart in 1999). The study sample was randomly selected from among all eligible patients stratified by site. We sought 100 patients per site and achieved a final sample size of 981. Data Collection and Sources We used the VA's CPRS, known as the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Archi\u00ad tecture, and the OutPatient Clinic file. The Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Archi\u00ad tecture, which is maintained at the hospital within a site, contains multiple files, including those with clini\u00ad cal data such as vital signs, laboratory and radiologic test results, pharmacy data, problem lists, and provider notes. It also contains an administrative-encounter file with diagnoses and procedures from all clinic visits that is transferred to a central VA data repository in Austin, Texas, and incorporated into the OutPatient Clinic file.28 At the clinic level, BP measurements usually are taken by a nurse and either directly entered into a sep\u00ad arate vital signs file with structured data entry fields in the CPRS, or reported on encounter forms and then entered by a clerk into this file. Additional BP data may be available through provider notes, which are either dictated and transcribed or typed directly into the provider notes file of the CPRS. (These clinical files are not yet routinely transferred centrally.) Study data were collected during the 12 months in 1999. For automated data, patient demographics, ICD\u00ad 9-CM-coded diagnoses, and medical clinic visit dates were obtained from the OutPatient Clinic file; BP meas\u00ad urements were extracted from the CPRS vital signs file. Vital signs file data were merged with OutPatient Clinic visit infonnation such that a visit was assigned to each BP recording. For dates with multiple clinic visits, such as visits to primary care and a general surgical clinic, we assigned all BP recordings to the medical clinic. Clinicians' notes from all medical visits of selected patients were obtained by accessing each site's local intranet and printing a hard copy. (As mentioned, the file containing these notes also is part of the CPRS, but the information would not be considered automated because it is free text.) An experienced nurse-abstractor then extracted note information including visit type, date, and BP. Blood pressure information from nurses' intake notes or clinicians' note entries that used an object template taken from the vital signs file were ignored because we were interested in whether the cli\u00ad nician took additional BP readings. A 5% random 'sample of charts (a chart comprises all clinical notes on a given patient) was reviewed by one of 474 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MANAGED CARE JULY 2004 Assessing Quality of Hypertension Care the authors (A.M.B.) for interrater reliability. Observed agreement on the presence and value of all readings was 96%. The only discrepancies found related to the pres\u00ad ence of a BP reading rather than to its value. Such dis\u00ad crepancies were more likely to occur for patients who had more than 6 visits and more than 5 BP readings available, with one or the other reviewer missing an available BP. Statistical Analyses Completeness of Automated Blood Pressure Information. First, we determined whether BP meas\u00ad urements were available in the CPRS vital signs file. Our denominator consisted of all OutPatient Clinic-identi\u00ad fied medical clinic visits in 1999. We examined the per\u00ad centage of visits with at least 1 BP measurement, as well as the percentage with 2 or more measurements. If mul\u00ad tiple identical BP values were found in the vital signs file for the same day, we deleted duplicates. Next, we examined how much additional BP infor\u00ad mation would be obtained by combining vital signs file data and information available in clinicians' notes. We used the same denominator and eliminated duplicate values in the notes. We examined the amount of infor\u00ad mation lost by calculating the differences between sources overall and by site. Discrepancies Between Sources. For visits with BP measurements available in both sources, we compared the number and value of BP recordings in the clinicians' notes with those in the vital signs file. We cross-tabu\u00ad lated visits by number of automated BP measurements against the number of BP measurements from the cor\u00ad responding visit notes. Additionally, we checked whether each BP recording in the vital signs file had an exact match in the clinicians' notes, and noted the fre\u00ad quency of visits at which this match occurred. We checked for a match using both individual BPs from a given source and the average of available BPs. We also examined whether BP documentation dif\u00ad ferences between sources (both in terms of BP pres\u00ad ence and average BP value at a given visit) were because the BP was high and therefore the clinician was more likely to repeat the measurement and report it in his or her note. We used the average BP in the vital signs file at a given visit and determined whether it was high (~140/90 mm Hg), We tested whether visits with vital signs file BPs versus those with BPs in both sources were more or less likely to have a high BP read\u00ad lng by using the chi-square test. We similarly compared the BPs of matching and nonrnatchlng visits. Variationin Judgment of J3lood Pressure Control. determined patient-level control by calculating the average BP for each patient at his or her last visit of the year for which a BP value was available. We calculated the percentage of patients with a BP less than 140/90 rnm Hg, examining results by source for the whole sam\u00ad ple and testing for site differences by using the chi\u00ad square test. We again computed differences between combined sources and the vital signs file alone. RESULTS Baseline sample characteristics are presented in Table 1. The number of patients per site varied from 71 to 103 because of differential adoption of electronic notes by site. There were 6097 visits to primary care, medical subspecialty clinics, and urgent and emergent care. Of these, 3987 were primary care Visits; 629 were subspecialty primary care visits (general internal medi\u00ad geriatrics, women's clinic, hypertension, cardiolo\u00ad gy, spinal cord clinic); and 1481 were subspecialty, urgent care, or nursing visits. How Complete Are the Data? Sixty percent of all medical visits had at least 1 BP measurement in the vital signs file (Table 2). Combining automated (vital signs file) and clinician note information, 71% of visits had at least 1 recorded BP measurement (Table 2). Therefore, 11%of visits had a BP measurement in the clinicians' notes that was not Table 1.

By site, the amount of available information lost using only the vital signs file varied from 1%to 35% (P < .0001; data not shown). Only 2%of visits had 2 or more BP measurements in the vital signs file, whereas 15% of visits had at least 2 BP measure\u00ad ments recorded by combined sources. Thus, 13%ofvis\u00ad its had a second BP measurement in the clinicians' notes that was not in the vital signs file. What Factors Are Associated With Discrepancies Between Sources? A BP measurement was available in both the vital signs file and the clinicians' notes for 1361 visits. Seventy-nine percent (1070/1361) of these visits had only 1 BP measurement in each source. The BP meas\u00ad urement matched exactly for 50% (678/1361) of these visits. Of these matching visits, 99% (674/678) had only 1 BP measurement in each source. Conversely, 50% (683/1361) of the BP measure\u00ad ments taken during visits did not match exactly. Fifty\u00ad eight percent (396/683) of these visits had only 1 BP measurement in each source. Of the 287 visits with more than 1 BP measurement available in either source, 188 visits had 1 BP value that matched and 237 visits had multiple BP measurements only in the clini\u00ad cians' notes; 30 visits had multiple BPs only in the vital signs fIle. Next we examined whether BP documentation differ\u00ad ences between sources were related to BP level. Of the , 4350 visits with a BP measurement in either source, 2316 had a BP measurement only in the vital signs file. Of these 2316 visits, 57% had a high BP reading (~140190 mm Hg), compared with 63%ofvisits with a BP measure\u00ad ment in both sources (P =.02).

This suggests the clinician was more likely to repeat the BP measurement when the intake value was high, resulting in non\u00ad matching values, rather than just tran\u00ad scribe the intake BP (matching values). How Do Judgments of Blood Pressure Control Vary Based on the Data Source? At the visit level, only 61 visits would have been misclassified depending on the source. At 48 visits, the BP would have been classified as uncontrolled according to the vital signs file, but would have been considered controlled when the combined source was used. At 13 Visits, the BPwould have been classified as controlled according to the vital signs file, but would have been considered uncontrolled when the combined source was used. At the patient level, using only automated data, the BP of 41% of the patients was controlled (see Table 3). Using both sources yielded similar results in terms of overall control and site ranklngs by percent control. Overall, 43%of patients hadcontrolled BP,and themost a site changed ranking was by 2 places (Table 3). Thus, the extra information provided in thc notes changed the assessment of BP control for a given patient in fewer than 2% of cases. In those few cases, the BP changed from uncontrolled to controlled. If one assumed patients with missing BP measure\u00ad ments had uncontrolled BP (~140190 mm Hg) at their last visit, this assumption made minimal difference to overall results or site ranklngs, even for the site missing the most data (10/101 patients), when just automated information was used. Health Employer Data and Information Set and the VA's performance review pro\u00ad gram use the lowest available BP and assume the BP is uncontrolled if missing.22,2.1 Analyzing by both these cri\u00ad teria made little difference to results (data not shown). DISCUSSION Current assessments of BP control rely largely on chart review and are therefore time-consuming and lim\u00ad ited in scope. If valid BP data were available in auto\u00ad mated form, this would make evaluations of BP control and quality of hypertension care more useful by encom\u00ad passing more cases and allowlng more timely feedback of information toCprovlders, so that corrective actions would be more 1i1{e1y.29 476 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MANAGED CARE JULY 2004 Assessing Quality of Hypertension Care In the present study, we found that most BP data were available Table 3.

Of the 22% of visits with BP values available in both the automated data and the clinician's notes, half the time the BP in the clinician's note was a duplicate of the vital signs file BP, suggesting that the clinician was simply taking this Informa\u00ad tion from the vital signs file or the nurse's note and incorporating it into his or her note.

Unlike our study, they found fewer VOL. 10, NO.7 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MANAGED CARE 477 CLINICAL BP measurements available in the automated data than the chart. For the process measure of the proportion of patients with a BP measurement in 1999, the respective proportions by source were 84%, 99%, and 99%for auto\u00ad mated data, medical record, and combined sources. If we were to construct a similar measure, 98%of our sam\u00ad ple's patients would have a BP measurement according to the automated data, whereas only 33% would have a BP measurement based on clinician note data alone; when the sources are combined, 100%would have a BP measurement. These differing results may have occurred because Kerr et al collected the BP data at dif\u00ad ferent time periods within sources and perhaps because they used a different. less complete, automated source. However, like our study, the Kerr et al study found that overall rates for outcome measures. including the per\u00ad centage of patients with BP less than 140/90 0101 Hg, LDL cholesterol less than 130 mg/dl., or HbA1c less than 9.5%. were comparable regardless of source, although they could not construct a combined BP control meas\u00ad ure because DP data were measured at different time periods. Thus, we are the first to examine an automated data\u00ad base with BP measurements and compare it with med\u00ad ical notes from the same time period. We found it yielded as much or more information than medical note review and gave assessments of performance compara\u00ad ble to those of a combined measure using automated data and notes. Our data are already a few years old. However, increased automation and familiarity with the VA's CPRS have occurred over this time period. Blood pres\u00ad sure information is now more likely to be entered into the database and is more likely to be entered directly by the nurse who took the measure, as opposed to a third party. Thus, newer vital signs file data should be even more accurate and complete. (In this study, 673 visits had a BP value only in the notes, which is unlikely to occur in the present VAambulatory clinic settlng.) There is no way to know tile true reliability and accu\u00ad racy of data entered into the vital signs file or clinicians' notes because we have no control over tile measure\u00ad ment, documentation, and data entry process. This is true for all information systems and medical records. Site 6 had tile fewest patients because of difficulty finding patients with available electronic notes. Also at this site, assessment of performance regarding BP con\u00ad trol varied the most by source. It had the lowest per\u00ad centage of BP values entered into the vital signs file and the second highest percentage with BP values only in ... the. nates. Thissit!u.V:as, clearly behind tile others in the adoption of the electronic record and also in the entry of BP measurements into the vital signs file. This likely has changed with time so that there will be less of a dis\u00ad crepancy between the 2 sources. Because we could not analyze by individual clinician, we do not know whether such assessments would vary by source. However, most visits were associated with only 1 BP value in either source, with more visits hav\u00ad ing information available in tile vital signs file than in tile notes. With increased adoption of the vital signs file, we would expect that those visits where only 1 BP value was available only in the notes would now have that information entered into the vital signs file. Therefore, clinician assessments should be consistent between sources. All healthcare systems face the challenge of develop\u00ad ing effective methods for assessing the quality of care. In the case of hypertension, such assessments require accurate BP information. Although this study only examined VA data systems and settings, it is likely that non-VA clinicians behave similarly with regard to BP measurement. We believe that by implementing or enhancing existing medical record systems with similar extractable data fields. other healthcare organizations also may find that they are able to make more efficient decisions about hypertension care. Moreover, such sys\u00ad tems could incorporate other clinical data fields that could be likewise extractable. making clinically detailed information more readily obtainable and facilitating monitoring of various quality indicators across many medical conditions. These could include information such as whether a pneumococcal vaccination was given or a foot cxam performed on a patient with diabetes.\" Current performance review programs collect clini\u00ad cal data from both clinicians' notes and automated sources as available.22 Given the demonstrated com\u00ad pleteness of automated BPdata in the electronic record. we believe assessments of hypertension care can be made based on these data alone, making such evalua\u00ad tions more efficient. Where effective databases do not currently exist, the VA's vital signs file is a prototypical clinical computerized data system that could be easily adopted by other settings.

Objectives: The objective of this study was to explore the relation\u00ad ship of guideline-based depression process measures with subse\u00ad quent overall and psychiatric hospitalizations. Research Design: This is a retrospective cohort study during which we used administrative and centralized pharmacy records for sample identification, derivation of guideline-based process measures (antide\u00ad pressant dosage and duration adequacy),and subsequenthospitalization ascertainment. Depression care was measured from June I, 1999, through August 31,1999. We used multivariable regressionto evaluate the link between depression care and subsequent overalland psychiatric hospitalization, adjusting for patient age, race, sex, socioeconomic status, comorbid illness, and hospitalization in the prior 12 months. Subjects: We studied a total of 12,678 patients from 14 Northeast\u00ad ern VHA hospitals. Results: We identified adequate antidepressant dosage in 90% and adequate duration in 45%. Those with adequate duration of antide\u00ad pressants were less likely to be hospitalized in the subsequent 12 months than those with inadequate duration (odds ratio [ORl, .90; 95% confidence interval [CIl, .81-1.00).

Conclusions: Guideline-based depression process measures derived from centralized data sources offer an important method of depres\u00ad sion care surveillance. Their accuracy in capturing depression care quality is supported by their link to healthcare utilization. Further work is needed to assess the effect of implementing these quality indicators on depression care.

Depression is a chronic, often relapsing illness, especially if undertreated initially.2,4 Most patients who seek care for depression are treated exclusively in primary care settings where at least 50% of patients are undiagnosed and 40% to 55% are insufficiently treated,\" Clinical guideline development (1993) evolved in response to these well-documented inadequacies in the recognition and treatment of depression.v'\" and a plethora of investigations have recently outlined efficacious quality improvement strat\u00ad egies for advancing depression care.1 0-13 On review of this evidence, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recently endorsed routine screening for depressive disorders in pri\u00ad mary care settings with established systems for diagnosis, effective treatment, and follow Up.14,lS The national imperative to improve the quality ofhealth care'\" has included initiatives to translate depression quality improvement strategies into clinical practice.

Although bar\u00ad riers to implementing similar programs in naturalistic clinical settings exist,2othe imperative to improve and protect health\u00ad care quality in this era of health system reorganization man\u00ad date persistence in overcoming them. Successful quality improvement depends on accurate information about healthcare quality; seminal health services literature directs us to health system structure (number of area hospitals, clinics, providers), process (health care rendered to patients), and outcomes (eventual consequences of health care) for this information.21.22 Observing expected relation\u00ad ships between the 3 is especially powerful; ie, appropriate process of care results in a positive healthcare outcome. Few observational studies have established this link between pro\u00ad cess and outcomes for depression23-2S; this is important not only for establishing accuracy, or internal validity, of a process measure, but also for quantifying the benefits of appropriate care. It could also lend clinical credibility to the measure (ie, clinicians could be more likely to comply with clinical care profiling that uses process measures clearly linked to improved outcomes). Healtheare utilization is a fundamental general health\u00ad care outcome. Depression effects increased health services utilization, 2,26,27 and recent work has identified it as an independent predictor of inpatient hospital readmission after adjusting for age, comorbidities, and functional status.28 Es\u00ad tablishing a link between depression process measures and healthcare utilization would lend substantial weight to the predictive validity of these process measures.i? We have previously used centralized administrative and pharmacy records of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to define guideline-based depression process mea\u00ad sures, to assess depression care using these measures, and to identify patient- and provider-level predictors of adequate depression care.30 We now explore the relationship of these process measures of depression care with subsequent overall and psychiatric hospitalizations. METHODS Study Design and Sample Definition We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients from 14 VHA medical centers in New England and upstate New York, relying entirely on existing databases. Full details are reported elsewhere.\" In brief, we used VHA centralized administrative and pharmacy records to define a depressed cohort that Underwent antidepressant treatment during a 3-month period in 1999. Subject eligibility criteria were as follows: at least I International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis code 296.2x or 296.3x (major depression single or recurrent episode, respectively) noted from a psychiatry, primary care, Il:l 2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins emergency, or social work clinical setting during October I, 1997, through September 30, 1999 (FY'98 or FY'99) or at least 1 ICD-9-CM diagnosis code 311.xx (depression not otherwise specified [NOS]) in a primary care clinical setting during FY'98 or FY'99, exclusive of other depression diag\u00ad nosis codes; and receipt of at least 2 antidepressant from a VHA pharmacy during the time period of depression care profiling (June I, 1999, through August 31, 1999). We excluded patients with comorbid schizophrenia and/or bipolar disorder, because these illnesses can produce symptoms that could be confused with depression, or if combined with depression, will often be best treated by addressing the underlying chronic mental illness. Comorbid schizophrenia and/or bipolar disorder were noted by 2 out\u00ad patient or I inpatient ICD-9-CM diagnosis code 295.00\u00ad 295.95 or (bipolar disorder) during FY'98 or FY'99. We identified 27,665 patients with depression during FY'98 and FY'99, representing 8.5% of the patient popula\u00ad tion in our 14 study sites. We eliminated 4809 (17%) because of comorbid schizophrenia and/or bipolar disease. Of those remaining, 19,1l9 (84%) were treated with antidepressant medication during FY'99. Of these, 12,678 received antide\u00ad pressants during June I, 1999, through August 31, 1999, referred to henceforth as the 3-month profiling period; this represents the final sample for which the process of depres\u00ad sion care can be linked to subsequent hospitalization. Their characteristics are reported in Table I. Depression Stage We stratified patients by depression stage because there are important stage-specific recommendations in the depres\u00ad sion guidelines that might affect care. We identified depres\u00ad sion stage using clean periods, defined as the period of time before the initial visit for depression that was free of both depression-coded clinical visits and antidepressant prescrip\u00ad tions. We applied a 6-month clean period in defining subject depression stage: acute (first 3 months after initial diagnosis), continuation (4-9 months), or maintenance (greater than I year after initial diagnosis).31.32 Independent Variables Guideline-Based Depression Process Measures We compared 3 dimensions of antidepressant therapy with clinical guideline benchmarks using the 1997 VHA Depression Guidelines,\" a compilation of recommendations from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ, formerly AHCPR) and the American Psychiatric Association depression guidelines.v\" Dosage adequacy was achieved when the antidepressant average daily dosage dur\u00ad ing the 3-motitJi\"ptofifiilg'Wtfda met the guideline-recom\u00ad mended minimum daily dosage. It was calculated in the following manner: number of prescribed tablets X strength 523 Copyright \u00a9 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.

(mg) tablet/number of prescription days. This average strength per day was compared with the guideline-recom\u00ad mended minimum daily dosages and defined as adequate if these were met, resulting in a dichotomous outcome variable. Any of 22 antidepressants (Appendix A) prescribed during the 3-month profiling period were analyzed; however, antidepressant exclusion criteria were specified to most ac\u00ad curately capture the process of care. These included: 1) concomitant (~7 days overlapping) prescriptions for traz\u00ad odone, bupropion, or any tricyclic antidepressant were not analyzed for dosage or duration adequacy because these medications could be used for therapeutic indications other than depression (ie, smoking cessation, insomnia); and 2) if patients received multiple antidepressants that did not have the same dosage adequacy,they _were assigned the dosage adequacy of the antidepressant prescribed for longer. The appropriateness of adjunctive medications occa\u00ad sionally used to treat depression such as benzodiazepines, valproate, lithium, or antipsychotic regimens was not ad\u00ad dressed in this study as a result of nonspecific guideline recommendations for their use. Duration adequacy for each patient characterized the overall length of therapy with any eligible antidepressant during the profiling period. It was calculated as follows for continuation and maintenance-stage patients: number of days without antidepressant medication/number of days in the 3-month period. We recognized that for continuation and maintenance-stage patients, inadequate duration of therapy might actually represent cessation of therapy secondary to cure or patient self-referral to private-sector care. Therefore, we conducted a sensitivity analysis excluding continuation and maintenance-stage patients without antidepressants dur\u00ad ing the 6 months after the profiling period (896 patients from 11,900); this demonstrated similar conclusions (49% with adequate duration of antidepressants vs. 45%). Therefore, we hold all stages accountable for continuous dosing during the profiling period. For acute-stage patients, the calculation of duration adequacy was as follows: number of days without antidepressant medication/number of days in 3-month period after the first prescription. Duration adequacy was defined as a dichotomy, with inadequate duration being >21% of the profiling period without antidepressants. This somewhat arbitrary boundary (.21) translates into 3 weeks of the 3-month period (or 1 week per month) and is consistent with other definitions of contin\u00ad uous dosing in the literature.\" Sensitivity analyses of the duration adequacy definition were performed using different boundaries, as well as using duration adequacy as a contin\u00ad uous variable. Our findings were not affected by these vari\u00ad ations. Follow-up visit adequacy was determined only for the acute stage because explicit guideline-based follow-up rec\u00ad ommendations exist only for this group. Adequacy was de\u00ad fined as at least 3 visits to primary care or psychiatry clinics within 3 months of the initial depression encounter. At least 2 visits in addition to the initial one within the first 3 months of diagnosis accords with guideline-recommended follow-up care. Defining Potential Confounders of Relationship Between Depression Care Process and Outcomes We adjusted for several potential confounders of the link to subsequent hospitalization.28,33.34 Patient age, sex, race, and marital status were identified from the administra\u00ad tive files. We used mean income per zip code from the 1998 Internal Revenue Service tax returns file as a proxy for individual income asa result ofuncertainty ofthe accuracy of reported income in'our admTxrlstraclve-clata. We determined prior hospitalization (YIN) during the 12 months before hospitalization outcome assessments. \u00a9 2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Copyright \u00a9 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

This complemented 5% of missing race data, mostly by identifying white race. We identified comorbidity burden using an unweighted count of up to 30 medical conditions, derived from the General Health Questionnaire of the Medical Outcomes Study,36and used in the Veterans Health Study to assess the relationship of comorbidities to health-related quality of life.37 We demonstrated similar conclusions by using the Charlson index (data not shown). Comorbid psychiatric con\u00ad ditions, including anxiety disorder, alcoholism, and posttrau\u00ad matic stress disorder (PTSD), were coded individually be\u00ad cause their impact on the process of depression care could be greater than other comorbid medical conditions.s,38 All co\u00ad morbidities were identified from inpatient and outpatient VHA administrative data during FY'98 and FY'99. Dependent Variables Subsequent OveraU and Psychiatric Hospitalizations We identified subsequent inpatient hospitalizations from the Patient Treatment File, which documents all VHA inpatient hospital stays. Observational (overnight), acute care, and new extended care hospitalizations during the 12 months after the depression care profiling period were identified for the utiliza\u00ad tionsubsample.We differentiatedsubsequentpsychiatrichospi\u00adtalizationfromall A sensitivity analysis exclusively using principal diag\u00ad nosis (ie, primary reason for admission) did not reveal signifi\u00ad cant differences. We defined subsequent hospitalization as a dichotomy (any vs. none) in all regression analyses. Analysis We identified the number and type of hospitalizations during the 12 months after the depression care profiling period. We used logistic regression to examine the relation\u00ad ship of depression care adequacy with subsequent hospital\u00ad ization, adjusting for patient age, sex, race, income, marital status, hospitalization in the prior year, and comorbid illness burden. Because depression care process could affect subse\u00ad quent psychiatric hospitalization differently from other hos\u00ad pitalization types, we evaluated its relationship with overall hospitalizations and psychiatric hospitalizations in separate regressions. We were concerned that different combinations of de\u00ad pression care adequacy might have modified outcomes; there\u00ad fore, we examined statistical interaction between dosage and duration adequacy separately using both a multiplicative duration (referent group). We did not observe statistical interaction; therefore, the simpler models are presented here (Table 2). Subjects with missing data were excluded from all regression analyses. Significant differences were demon\u00ad strated between the analytic subsample (those with data entered into the multivariable models) and the overall sample. The overall sample was 1 year older (P <0.05), had a $1500 higher annual income (P <0.05), and was 3% more married (P <0.05) compared with the analytic subsample. We were concerned that hospitalization during the profiling period might have affected duration adequacy (ie, medications could be temporarily discontinued during hospi\u00adtalization); consequently, we used a chi-squared test to com\u00ad pare duration adequacy between those who were hospitalized during the profiling period (8.3% of the sample) and those who were not hospitalized. We identified a statistically sig\u00adnificant difference in depression care adequacy: 41% duration adequacy for those hospitalized during the profiling period versus 45% for those without hospitalizations during the profiling period. Although this is probably not a clinically meaningful difference, we distinguished hospitalization dur\u00ad ing the prior 12 months from hospitalization occurring in the profiling period in assessing its relationship with subsequent overall and subsequent psychiatric hospitalization (Table 2). We were concerned that the link between depression care process and outcome might be moderated by depression stage and/or depression diagnosis type. Therefore, we sepa\u00ad rately examined the association between depression care and subsequent hospitalization for each depression stage and depression diagnosis type (ie, major depression vs. depressive disorder NOS). We did not identify a significant association after stratifying the analyses by depression diagnosis type (data not shown). Additional analyses of the depression diagnosis types have been reported elsewhere.\" We adjusted for follow-up visit adequacy (YIN) in the multivariable re\u00ad gressions for the acute stage. We did not identify a significant association; therefore, we excluded follow-up visit adequacy from the final models (Table 3). All analyses were performed using SAS version 8.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). RESULTS We identified 2399 patients (19%) who had at least one hospitalization during the 12 months after the profiling pe\u00ad riod. Of these, 965 patients had at least I psychiatric hospi\u00ad talization. Overall, 1272 patients (53%) had only 1 hospital\u00ad ization; the remainder had 2 or greater. The majority of hospitalizations were for acute care (74%), 11% were for observational care, and the remainder for extended care (data interaction term and a 4-part dummy adherence variable. TIie--'''-not snown). PTSD and alcoholism were the leading causes of 4-part variable was coded as all possible unions of dosage and hospitalization (20% overall). Three percent of the hospital- duration adequacy versus inadequate dosage and inadequate izations were the result of depression (10th leading cause). \\C2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Copyright \u00a9 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Linking healthcare process and outcomes is critical in demonstrating the validity of quality indicators and the magnitude of benefit from high\u00ad quality care.21 It also augments credibility for practitioners and systems implementing quality improvement programs. We identified a significant association between I de\u00ad pression process measure (duration adequacy) and hospital\u00ad ization during the 12 months after depression care profiling; those with adequate duration of antidepressants had a 10% lower odds of overall hospitalization and an 18% lower odds of psychiatric hospitalization than those with inadequate duration of antidepressants. This is consistent with the find\u00ad ings ofothers,26.28 who have demonstrated that untreated and undertreated depression is a risk factor for higher health services utilization. A similar evaluation has been done re\u00ad cently among a schizophrenic cohort, which illustrated that inadequate care as measured by guideline-based process mea\u00ad sures resulted in increased subsequent hcspitalization.l\" We did not demonstrate a significant association between dosage adequacy and subsequent hospitalization; this could be the result of the lack of variation in this measurement (the overwhelming majority had adequate dosing of antidepressants) or the possibility that some were prescribed lower antidepressant doses for therapeutic indications other thandepression. We have performed a number of sensitivity analyses to further explore this possibility; these are reported elsewhere.l? in which we concluded that despite the limited clinical detail of our data sources, they allowed for valuable insight into the process of depression care. Nonetheless, observing a significantly lower odds of subsequent overall and psychiatric hospitalization among those with adequate duration ofantidepressants strength\u00ad ens the predictive validity of this process measure. Further evaluation of the association between appropriate depression care and ensuing healthcare utilization is needed. We identified suboptimal follow-up visits (62%) among the acute stage. Although we did not demonstrate an association of follow-up visit adequacy with subsequent over\u00ad all or psychiatric hospitalization, further exploration among a larger sample is warranted Additionally, future research might explore and define optimal follow-up visit patterns that link to important healthcare outcomes for continuation and maintenance-stage patients. We present our analyses of the depression care process\u00ad outcome link stratified by depression stage in Table 3. We did not demonstrate marked differences among the groups after adjusting for potential confounders. Nevertheless, we add to a growing literature assessing depression stage differenc\u00ad 528 es.40.41 Although this topic needs further study, health sys\u00ad tems implementing depression quality improvement pro\u00ad grams might want to consider differentiating among the depression stages. We identified black race as a predictor of subsequent overall and psychiatric hospitalization. We had previously identified black race as a predictor of inadequate depression care.30 We recognize that there could be several reasons for these racial differences in depression care process and out\u00ad comes that are not captured by these data, including patient preferences, health beliefs, concurrent private sector care, and a small, nonrepresentative black subgroup. Nonetheless, this disparity is consistent with earlier studies, which describe differential receipt of needed procedures and appropriate medication regimens between black and white patients. 42-44 Additionally, racial differences in depression care quality have been identified in 2 recent observational studies.42.44 Further investigation of racial differences in depression care quality is needed. Prior hospitalization was identified as a strong predictor of subsequent overall and psychiatric hospitalization. More than I hospitalization during the prior 12 months (ie, at least once during the profiling period and intervening 9 months) was the strongest predictor of subsequent overall and psychi\u00ad atric hospitalization. This is not an unexpected finding that is consistent with a large literature predicting rehospitaliza\u00ad tion.33,34 Those younger than age 65 were 13% less likely to have a subsequent overall hospitalization but were 2.29 times more likely to have a subsequent psychiatric hospitalization. This finding is consistent with prior studies demonstrating a disproportionately higher level of psychiatric illness and poorer mental health-related quality of life among younger 39 compared with older patients in the VHA.37Those with comorbid alcoholism were more likely to have a subsequent overall and psychiatric hospitalization. Those with comorbid PTSD were more likely to have a subsequent psychiatric hospitalization. Although these findings are not surprising, future studies might further define the impact of depression and comorbid psychiatric and medical illness on healthcare outcomes. More clinically detailed information would allow us to assess the comprehensiveness of our process measures in capturing the quality of depression care. Change in depres\u00ad sive symptomatology over the profiling period would estab\u00ad lish criterion validity of these measures, but our data sources do not provide such information. Furthermore, the magnitude of the association between depression care process and out\u00ad comes observed here was small. We recognize the possibility that these administrative data have incorrectly identified pa\u00ad tients-as depressed. The observed association mighthave c\u00b7 been stronger if we could have eliminated falsely identified patients from the sample.

Medical Care Volume 42, Number 6, June2004 Monitoring Depression Care between administrative data-derived depression diagnoses and criterion depression diagnoses has moved the literature toward consensus on identification of depression using ad\u00ad ministrative data.31,45,46 Nonetheless, our exclusive use of administrative and centralized pharmacy records mirrors the practical reality of quality profiling in a naturalistic clinical setting. Health systems should consider systematic, central\u00ad ized collection of depression-specific data. Further examina\u00ad tion of the relationship among depression process measures, general healthcare outcomes, and depression-specific out\u00ad comes is necessary. This study has limitations. Restricting depression care profiling to the Northeastern United States limits generaliz\u00ad ability to the national veteran patient population. These sites were chosen for ease of data collection; the VHA national pharmacy database was organized just prior to the study design phase, and access to their data was unclear initially. Nevertheless, these hospitals represent diverse geographic settings and reflect the experience of the national veteran patient population\" Furthermore, one should maintain cau\u00ad tion in applying these findings to non-VHA healthcare set\u00ad tings, especially given that our predominantly male sample might not generalize to the national population undergoing depression care, the majority of whom are women.? Never\u00ad theless, the VHA experience in healthcare quality monitoring can be a leading teaching source for other large, integrated health systems. A great strength of this study is its intensive use of the rich, multifold data sources of the VHA, which is the largest, integrated healthcare system in the United States. These depression process measures have face validity, because guideline-concordant depression care has been connected with improved outcomes in diverse study settings.23,25,47 The use of clinical guideline benchmarks in defining depression process measures is demonstrated in this study, although more work is needed for validity and reliability to be firmly established. We recognize depression care that falls short of guideline recommendations, especially regarding duration of therapy. Further investigation is needed to determine reasons for these depression care deficits. Performance measurement has become a prominent reality in today's changing healthcare system. Accurately and reliably capturing healthcare quality is an important mission. The mental healthcare field has contributed substantially to this critical objective. Notably, recent schizophrenia treat\u00ad ment guidelines48 have rendered findings from considerable efficacy research into salient treatment recommendations and user-friendly quality measures. The Health Plan Employer Data and Information System (HEDIS), a set of standardized performance measures to which health maintenance organi\u00ad zations are held accountable in accreditation, has become an important information source for mental healthcare quali\u00ad ty.49,50 In fact, our depression process measures differ from co 2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins those of HEOIS only by our use of a measure for adequacy of antidepressant dosing and by our definition of antidepressant duration adequacy. For example, we dichotomized duration adequacy at 79% compared with HEDIS at 93%. Addition\u00ad ally, the operationalism of these measures could vary among health systems with differing centralized pharmacy data ac\u00ad cess. The centralized pharmacy data of the VHA is amenable to medication adherence formulations used by others and adapted for depression care in this study,3\u00b0 This study adds to our skill in profiling mental health\u00ad care quality and will hopefully inform healthcare systems moving toward translating efficacious quality improvement interventions into practice. lO,13.18 To strive for powerful methods of surveying and protecting the quality of mental health care is crucial in this era of shifting resources and healthcare reorganization.

We conducted a mail survey of 282 randomly sampled physicians in general internal medicine (31%), family medicine (34%) and obstetrics-gynecology (35%). Experience with prescribing EC significantly differed by specialty (63% of general internists, 76% of family physicians, and 94% of obstetrician-gynecologists, p < 0.0001). Controlling for year of graduation, gender, religion and practice location, family physicians [adjusted odds ratio (OR): 2.5,95% CI: 4.0-31.3) were still significantly more likely to have ever prescribed EC than general internists. Efforts to increase awareness and knowledge of EC should be aimed at general internists since they provide primary care for many reproductive age women. II::> 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. Keywords: Emergency contraception; Practice patterns 1. Introduction Widespread availability of emergency contraception (EC) could have a tremendous impact in reducing the num\u00ad ber of unintended pregnancies and abortions in this country [I]. EC pills, which are combined estrogen-progestin pills or progestin-only pills, are safe and effective for preventing unintended pregnancies. They are more effective when taken as soon as possible after unprotected intercourse. Therefore, it is critical that a woman seeking EC be able to obtain a physician's attention as soon as possible. Obtaining medication can be delayed if the physician is unfamiliar with how to properly evaluate the patient, unable to provide appropriate counseling or uncertain how to prescribe the method. In order for EC to be accessible, primary care physicians of all specialties need to be familiar with this method. In a 1997 survey, the Kaiser Family Foundation reported that 85% of obstetrician-gynecologists and 50% -see front matter Q 2004 Elsevier Inc. AU rights reserved. doi: 10.1 016/j.contraccption.2003.09.003 sicians had prescribed EC at least once in the preceding year [2]. Other studies have further characterized the EC pre\u00ad scribing practices of obstetrician-gynecologists, pediatri\u00ad cians, adolescent health specialists and family physicians [2-8]. Although internal medicine physicians provide pri\u00ad mary care for a significant proportion of reproductive-age women [9], little is known about their EC prescribing prac\u00ad tices. We sought to compare the EC prescribing practices of general internists with those of other primary care providers of reproductive-age women. 2. Methods 2.1. Study subjects Approval for this study was obtained from the Institu\u00ad tional Review Board for Human Research at the Boston University Medical Center. Board-certified physicians in internal medicine, family medicine and obstetrics-gynecol\u00ad ogy were identified from the Folio's of Massachusetts Da\u00ad . tebsse, a listing of registered physicians in Massachusetts.~ __ -....

We randomly sampled 200 such physicians from each of the three specialties, resulting in 600 potential study subjects. 2.2. Survey instrument The 29-item survey was developed to assess physician attitudes and practice patterns regarding certain reproduc\u00ad tive health issues. A question assessing EC practices asked: \"As part of your clinical practice, how often do you pre\u00ad scribe emergency contraception? (e.g., Ovral 2 pills every 12 hours for 2 doses)?\" The categorical response choices were \"never,\" \"1-5 times/year,\" \"6-10 times/year,\" and \">10 times/year.\" Respondents also supplied information on demographics (specialty, year of medical school gradu\u00ad ation, gender and religion) and practice characteristics (practice location and contraception prescribing practices). The survey was initially piloted to 10 physicians represent\u00ad ing the three different specialties. The anonymous question\u00ad naire was then mailed to the 600 physicians in April 2000. 2.3. Analysis All statistical analyses were performed using SAS for Windows, Version 8.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). The main outcome variable was dichotomous: \"ever prescribed emergency contraception\" Multivariable analysis was formed using logistic regression to examine the simulta\u00ad neous effects of physician specialty, year of medical school graduation, gender, religion ap,ltpractice location, To further assess prescribing frequencies, EC prescribing rates were then categorized into 0-5 times per year vs. >5 times per year. The percentages of physicians who pre\u00ad scribed at these different frequencies were then compared across specialties. All analyses were two-tailed, using p < 0.05 as criterion for statistical significance. 3. Results Of the 600 physicians who were mailed the survey, 55 replied that they were no longer practicing in Massachusetts and 33 questionnaires were returned because of incorrect addresses, leaving 512 subjects eligible for the study. Three\u00ad hundred completed surveys were returned for a response rate of 59%. We then excluded 16 respondents because they were either subspecialists or did not indicate their specialty. Another two physicians were excluded because they did not answer the question on EC. The remaining 282 subjects were analyzed. There were 86 internists (31%), 96 family physicians (34%), and 100 obstetrician-gynecologists (36%) in the final sample (Table 1). The specialties differed with respect to several characteristics. The obstetrician\u00ad gynecologists were more likely 'to have graduated from medical school before 1980 (62%) compared with the in\u00ad ternists (45%) and the family physicians (41%, p = 0.007). The majority of internists worked in urban neighborhoods (51%), while the family physicians and obstetrician-gyne\u00ad cologists were more likely to have suburban or rural prac\u00ad tices (69%, and 62%, respectively, p = 0.03). Although most of the internists prescribe contraception for at least 25% of their female patients of reproductive age (52%), the family physicians (70%) and obstetrician-gynecologists (89%) were more likely to do so (p < 0.0001). The specialties differed substantially in their EC pre\u00ad (64%, p < 0.0001). In the multivariable analysis adjusting for year of medical school graduation, gender, religion and practice location (Table 2), family physicians [adjusted odds ratio 45 CiH.

(OR): 2.5, 95% confidence 95% CI: 4.0\u00ad 31.3) remained more likely to report having ever prescribed EC than general internists. Being a female physician was a positive predictor (adjusted OR: 9.6, 95% CI: 3.2-29.1), while Catholic religion predictor (adjusted OR: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.19-0.79) for having ever prescribed EC. When examining prescribing frequency, we found that 75% of the respondents (86% of general internists, 82% of family physicians and 57% of obstetricians-gynecologists) report prescribing EC no more than five times a year. There\u00ad fore, the majority of the physicians, regardless of specialty, prescribe EC infrequently. Only 10% of all the physicians reported prescribing more than 10 times a year. 4. Discussion Although general internists provide over 20% of all non\u00ad obstetric outpatient care to women of reproductive age [9], their EC prescribing practices have not been described pre\u00ad viously. In this anonymous, self-administered survey, gen\u00ad eral internists were significantly less likely to report ever prescribing EC than family physicians and obstetrician\u00ad gynecologists. This finding persisted when controlling for other potential predictors of prescribing EC. Strengths of this study were the use of a random sam\u00ad pling method and the ability to control for several potential confounders. The study also has several limitations. Al\u00ad though a diverse group of practitioners from around the state with a wide range of ages and practice settings were sampled, Massachusetts' physicians may not represent phy\u00ad sicians nationwide. Another concern is respondent bias, where respondents willing to complete a survey about re\u00ad productive health issues may have more strongly held be\u00ad liefs about contraceptive management and be either more or ~--- 'leSSlikely to prescribe EC than nonresponding physicians. As with any self-report study, there may be reporting bias, where a physician may report what they feel is ideal behav\u00ad ior, rather than true behavior. Another limitation is differences in the characteristics of the specialties studied. Obstetrician-gynecologists are likely to care for more reproductive-age women than the other specialties. Also, women with multiple providers may pref\u00ad erentially request EC from their obstetrician-gynecologists rather than from their internists. Our survey did not inquire about the number of requests that physicians received for EC. Since internists and family physicians may be faced with fewer opportunities to prescribe EC, we chose whether EC had ever been prescribed as the main outcome variable. Therefore, any single experience with providing EC was considered, in an attempt to reduce bias due to differences in frequency of requests. Primary care providers of all specialties should provide routine contraceptive care, including the provision of EC. Although the family physicians and obstetrician-gynecolo\u00ad gists prescribed EC more frequently than general internists, the majority of physicians in all three specialties reported prescribing less than five times a year. Physicians are likely missing many opportunities for counseling and prescribing EC. Providers should to be prepared to urgently provide EC to the patient who presents after unprotected intercourse. They should also provide advance prescriptions during rou\u00ad tine visits. This study suggests that general internists pre\u00ad scribe EC less than other primary care physicians. Efforts should be aimed at general internists to increase their aware\u00ad ness ofEC. References [I] Trussell I, Stewart Koenig 10, Parker ML, HoffT, McIntosh M.

INTRODUCTION Joseph Conigliaro and Tamra Madenwald ALCOHOL USE AND abuse may have significant im- plications for the clinical management of human im- munodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients and may playa major role in determining patient outcomes. Alcoholabuse in HIV is believed to be associated with increasedmorbidity and mortality, more rapid disease progression,poorer adherence to antiretroviral regimens, and greater risk of viral resistance (Conigliaro et al., 2003; Cook et al.,2001; Justice et al., 2002; Kalichman et al., 2000; Wagner etal., 2001). Alcohol's effect on HIV, however, has not yetbeen fully characterized. To date, HIV cohort studies haveneither collected adequate data on alcohol use nor suffi-ciently considered the effect of the interaction of alcoholuse and comorbid disease on patient outcomes. This sym- posium reviews the research design and findings to datefrom the Veterans Aging Cohort Studies (VACS) to illus-trate the multifaceted role of alcohol in health outcomesamong HIV-infected veterans and to highlight the designand potential future analyses as more sophisticated dataare collected in the current VACS (Table 1). VACS, acollaboration funded by the NIAAA between the NIAAAand the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), is a multi-site 5-year longitudinal cohort study of the effect of alcoholuse and chronic disease on health outcomes in veteranswith and without HIV infection. In the long term, theseanalyses should guide clinical decision-making and informthe development of effective interventions for HIV-infected patients who use and abuse alcohol. VACS is a longitudinal study of 6000 veterans receiving care at 8 VA medical centers. When completed, the cohortwill consist of 3000 HIV-infected and 3000 noninfectedveterans who are matched by age, race, and clinical site.The study began in June 2002 and is currently completingbaseline enrollment, with data collection continuingthrough June 2007. As of September 2003, VACS hadrecruited more than 4700 subjects.

VACS 3 (June 1999 though July 2000) collected survey, administrative, and electronic medicalrecord data on 881 HIV-infected veterans receiving care at3 VA HIV clinics. VACS 5 (October 2001 though June2002) collected similar feasibility data on 1851 veterans,1064 HIV-infected veterans, and 787 noninfected veteranswho were matched by age, race, and clinical site at 5 VAmedical centers. The collection of patient and provider factors is invalu- able and unique to VACS. Although many cohort studieshave relied on medical records to collect data, the collec-tion of medical record data is often difficult because muchtime is spent focusing on finding patients 'charts and hold- ing them long enough to extract data. Obtaining relevantlaboratory and pharmacy data is also a burden, becauseoften laboratory results are misplaced or not filed at thetime the chart is found. As a result, certain critical dataelements are missed. However, the VA has the largestelectronic medical records system in the world. It is fullyintegrated and easily accessible nationwide; therefore,VACS is able to collect critical up-to-date data elementsfrom each patient 's medical records, such as inpatient and outpatient data; laboratory data; pharmacy data; and pa-thology, radiology, and progress notes (Fig. 1). By concen-trating on linking a larger variety of data sources on indi-vidual patients (Fig. 1), VACS is able to measure and testthe association of patient factors with HIV measures.These patient factors include medication adherence, qual- ity of life, symptom burden, health behaviors and providerrelationships from the patient survey, International Classi-fication of Diseases (ICD)-9 codes and utilization anddeath records from the VA administrative record, adher-ence determination, presence of comorbidities, and healthbehavior and symptoms assessments from the provider sur-vey (Fig. 1). Obtaining provider data enables VACS researchers to understand the provider 's assessment of the severity and prognosis of HIV disease, the presence or absence of co-morbid conditions, and the provider 's determination of whether the patient is adhering to his or her medication.The provider 's awareness of alcohol consumption and re- lated problems, a critical element in VACS, is alsodetermined. Blood and tissue banking allows VACS researchers to address important underlying mechanistic questions as theyare defined by clinical observation and research. Theseinclude evaluating surrogate markers, systematically study-ing pathophysiologic markers of drug and alcohol toxicity,and evaluating genetic predisposition to immune decline. The specific aim of all the VACS studies (VACS 3, VACS 5, and the current VACS) is to test the associationof patient factors, including comorbidities and behaviors,with HIV measures, such as adherence to medications,CD4 cell count, HIV viral load, and drug toxicity, as well astheir association with HIV disease progression, symptomburden, quality of life, comorbid disease, and survival. VACS is designed to specifically test the association ofalcohol use and abuse with HIV measures. The studies alsoassess patient and provider attitudes concerning alcoholuse and its interaction with HIV infection. The number and scope of the alcohol measures have differed among the three VACS studies (Table 2). BothVACS 3 and VACS 5 used only the Alcohol Use DisordersIdentification Test (AUDIT) (Babor et al., 1992; Conigraveet al., 1995; Fiellin et al., Saunders and Conigrave,1990), provider assessments, and ICD-9 codes. VACS,however, makes use of multiple alcohol measures, includ-ing the Lifetime Drinking History (Skinner and Sheu,1982), alcohol timeline follow-back (Sobell and Sobell,1994), AUDIT, Short Inventory of (alcohol) Problems(Miller et al., 1995), Alcohol Dependence Scale (Skinnerand Horn, 1984), and Composite International DiagnosticInterview Substance Abuse Module (Cottler et al., 1989).VACS also includes several measures to evaluate adher-Table 1.

One aim is to improve existing measures ofalcohol use and adherence among HIV-positive patients bydetermining which assessments are most relevant to HIV-infected patients and patients with other chronic diseases.Future VACS data will continue to include more sophisti-cated measures of alcohol-use patterns and alcohol diag-noses needed to develop provider- and system-based inter-ventions within this population. The presentation summaries that follow analyze prelim- inary data from VACS 3 that will guide the larger study 's development as it evolves and that will influence the designof future interventions, particularly as they relate to alcoholuse. Kendall Bryant placed the VACS study in the contextof translational research and showed how it offers an op-portunity to move significant research findings in alcoholand HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)effectively into clinical practice. Joseph Conigliaro andStephan Maisto described levels of excessive alcohol useamong HIV-infected veterans and its associated healthrisks, including patient and provider knowledge of thoserisks. Amy Justice and Jeffrey Samet examined the associ-ation of current hazardous alcohol use and/or past abusewith comorbid conditions and symptom burden. ScottBraithwaite and Amy Justice used a computer simulation toestimate the effect on long-term HIV outcomes of medi-cation nonadherence associated with alcohol use. AdamGordon and Robert Cook described the prevalence ofhomelessness, rates of alcohol abuse, and number of phy-sician visits among veterans with HIV. Finally, Shawn Fultzand Kevin Kraemer examined the prevalence of past andcurrent alcohol use among veterans co-infected with hep-atitis C virus (HCV) and assessed provider awareness ofsuch use. ALCOHOL AND HIV/AIDS: THE IMPORTANCE OF INTEGRATIVE AND TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH Kendall Bryant The VACS cohort of veterans represents an important population in which to study alcohol and HIV infection.Among veterans, both alcohol abuse (or dependence) andHIV infection are prevalent; veterans are older and morelikely to have co-occurring conditions related to both alco- hol and HIV. Among persons infected with HIV, veteransare also more likely to be African American or Hispanic, tohave a diverse exposure history, and, as such, to reflect theevolving HIV epidemic. The overall goal of the VACS is to examine in greater detail the role of alcohol use, abuse, and dependence in thetreatment of HIV disease. The relationship between alco-hol use, HIV treatment, and progression of disease is com- plex. Patterns of alcohol use directly and indirectly affectthe survival of HIV-infected individuals who drank heavilyin the past and may currently drink. Treatment providersoften underestimate the cumulative effect of alcohol mis-use on long-term health outcomes. The VACS study examines the prevalence and nature of alcohol consumption and characterizes its associated risk.It also explores patient and provider beliefs about alcoholconsumption and behavior change in both cross-sectionaland longitudinal research frameworks. The sophisticatedVA electronic record systems used in describing patient-provider encounters and additional information on individ-uals'history of alcohol consumption allows for detailed characterization of alcohol 's complex association with HIV disease severity and progression and with other co-occurring disease over time. Finally, the long-term goal ofVACS is to test dynamic interventions that involveprovider-patient relationships guided by detailed knowl-edge of these interchanges, which improve outcomes forpatients aging with HIV infection. Although we have described the immediate and future goals for the set of VACS studies (VACS 3, VACS 5, andVACS), the current study (VACS), funded by NIAAA, isintended to provide a platform for developing an integra-tive approach to research that allows for translation ofalcohol and AIDS research into clinical practice. The cur-rent study describes the complex relationships of alcoholand HIV and allows for a more complete picture of thepatient and clinical setting in which the treatment takesplace, which is elaborated from a variety of behavioral andbiological scientific perspectives. Thus, the VACS providesa rich source of data and a platform for integrative andcross-disciplinary research in both the behavioral and bio-logical sciences. As a result, for example, the effects ofTable 2.

In addition, VACS is designed to become an important tool in translational research, a research-to-practice initia-tive supported by the NIH and the VA that is designed tobridge the gap between researchers and clinicians by (1)identifying research advances ready for widespread adop-tion, (2) preparing materials that facilitate training andadoption of new techniques, and (3) disseminating knowl-edge about improved treatment and prevention practices.The effectiveness of the translational research initiativedepends on \"widening the research footprint \"to include more diverse groups of patients and more diverse treat-ment settings. VACS makes this possible. A panel of alco-hol experts oversees the current NIAAA-funded study,which integrates state-of-the art alcohol and HIV measure-ment. Development and testing of critical alcohol and HIVquestions allows for testing and integration of these itemsinto patient interviews, which can guide successful treat-ment in the future. These interviews and critical reminderscan be implemented in the electronic patient managementsystem, which the VA supports, to give provider feedbackon patient health status and functions as a structural sys-tems intervention. Finally, these new technologies can becarried into new treatment settings both in the US andabroad. ALCOHOL USE AND ABUSE AMONG PATIENTS WITH HIV INFECTION Joseph Conigliaro and Stephan Maisto We know that general medical health-care providers of- ten miss the opportunity to detect alcohol problems amongtheir patients (Conigliaro et al., 1998). It is not known howwell HIV providers address alcohol problems among theirpatients. In light of the mounting evidence that excessivealcohol use may be important in the management of HIV,the objectives of this analysis were to (1) describe levels ofexcessive alcohol use (including hazardous use, addiction,and dependence) among a group of HIV-infected veteranscared for at three VA medical centers, (2) determine theassociation between patterns of alcohol use and laboratorymarkers of HIV disease progression and antiretroviral drugtoxicity, and (3) assess provider awareness of both currentand past excessive alcohol use. Finally, we sought to deter-mine the patient characteristics that were associated withprovider failure to identify excessive alcohol consumption. In VACS 3, we assessed alcohol use in several ways. We asked the provider whether the patient \"drinks too much alcohol \"(mutually exclusive response options were \"never, \"\"past, \"or\"present \"). This question was structured to reflect the provider 's personal definition of \"drinking too much \"that would reflect his or her opinion, clinical expe- rience, and level of training. We also asked the patient asimilar question with the same mutually exclusive response options ( \"never, \"\"past, \"or\"present \"). In addition, we assessed at-risk alcohol use on the basis of the AUDIT (acutoff score of /H113508 out of 40 points detected \"at risk alcohol use\") (Babor et al., 1992; Isaacson et al., 1994). We exam- ined binge drinking alone by using the third question in theAUDIT, which asks whether the patient has had six ormore drinks on one occasion (Bush et al., 1998; Gordon etal., 2001). We extracted ICD-9 codes for diagnoses ofalcohol abuse and dependence from the VA electronicmedical record by identifying all ICD-9 codes for bothinpatient and outpatient care for up to 3 years before thepatient baseline survey (from fiscal years 1998 -2000 and before July 29, 2000). Laboratory variables [HIV-1 cell were collected directly from the laboratorydata in the electronic medical record for the date closest tothe baseline assessment. ALT and AST were standardizedto the top normal value at each site. Using data from VACS 3 (Conigliaro et al., 2003), we found that of 881 HIV-infected veterans (median age, 49years; 99% male; 54% African American), 20% met criteriafor current hazardous drinking by scoring 8 or greater onthe AUDIT (Babor et al., 1992; Isaacson et al., 1994).Thirty-three percent were binge drinkers (positive responseto the third item on the AUDIT), 32% had a chart ICD-9alcohol diagnosis over the last 5 years, and 12.5 and 66.7%,respectively, were described by their providers as currentlyor ever drinking \"too much. \"Hazardous/binge drinkers more often had detectable viral loads ( p/H110210.001). Patients with ICD-9 alcohol diagnoses of alcohol abuse or alcoholdependence more often had increased ALT or AST ( p/H11021 0.02), anemia ( p/H110210.001), and increased mean corpuscular volume ( p/H110210.001). Providers missed hazardous drinking among those undetectable viral loads ( p/H110050.01), and missed ICD-9 alcohol diagnoses among patients with-out hepatitis and with CD4 less than 200 cells permicroliter. Overall, we found that among HIV-positive veterans, alcohol use and hazardous drinking are common and areassociated with measures of HIV disease progressionand/or hepatic comorbidity and anemia. We also found thatproviders more often missed alcohol problems among pa-tients both with less severe HIV and without evidence ofliver disease. Because alcohol use and abuse are common among HIV- infected individuals and because providers do not routinelyidentify alcohol use and abuse, providers should routinelyscreen and counsel HIV-infected patients regarding alco-hol problems as part of a standard of care, in an effort tominimize disease progression and bone marrow and he-patic toxicity. Although interesting and important, the baseline VACS 3 results are limited by a lack of details on alcohol con-316 CONIGLIARO ET AL.sumption patterns, lifetime alcohol consumption, and alco- hol consequences. In the current VACS study, more exten-sive measures, as described previously, are used. As aresult, VACS will focus on more specific categories ofalcohol use and abuse in the context of the larger pattern ofcomorbidity and the interaction of alcohol, HIV infection,lifestyle, and behavior change. SEVERITY OF COMORBID ALCOHOL USE/ABUSE IN HIV INFECTION Amy Justice and Jeffrey Samet Many HIV-infected persons are receiving long-term treatment and, consequently, living long enough to age withthe infection. Comorbid disease, defined as any medical orpsychiatric condition not known to be caused by HIV in-fection, and its relationship to past and current alcohol useand abuse have yet to be characterized in HIV infection.Similarly, symptom burden (often a marker of comorbidillness) and its association with alcohol use and abuse hasyet to be characterized. We hypothesized that a diagnosis of past alcohol addic- tion or abuse and current hazardous drinking would havean additive effect for comorbid disease diagnoses andsymptom burden, as follows. First, those free of both adiagnosis of addiction or abuse and current hazardousdrinking would have the fewest symptoms and comorbidconditions; second, those with only one of these conditionswould have intermediate symptoms and comorbid condi-tions, and; third, those with both conditions would have themost symptoms and comorbid conditions. Data on AIDS-defining and comorbid conditions were collected in VACS 3 by using patient and provider report,diagnostic codes, laboratory data, and pharmacy data. Weidentified the best source for each condition by using auniform approach. Data on symptoms were collected di-rectly from patients via a self-completed standardized andvalidated instrument, the HIV Symptom Index (Justice etal., 2001). Current hazardous drinking (defined as an AUDIT score /H113508) was present in 36% of the patients surveyed (23% reported only hazardous drinking, and 13% were found toalso have a diagnosis of abuse or dependence). An ICD-9diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence alone waspresent in 14% of the patients 'electronic medical records. Of note, 50% of the patients neither reported currenthazardous drinking nor had a diagnosis of abuse or depen-dence. When we used these to test for an increasing trendof comorbid disease and symptom burden, we found thefollowing. Among physical symptoms (fevers/chills, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, headache, and muscle pain), there wasa statistically significant ( p/H110210.03 for each of the symptoms listed) increasing trend such that those with neither a di-agnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence nor current haz-ardous drinking had the lowest burden of symptoms andsuch that those with both conditions had the highest burdenof symptoms; those with one or the other condition had more intermediate levels of symptom burden. This was notas evident for emotional symptoms (sadness, nervousness,and sleep problems). For these symptoms, patients withneither condition had the lowest frequency of symptoms ( p /H110210.03), but there was not a clear increasing trend among those with one condition versus both conditions. It is inter-esting to note that diabetes and cancer seemed to decreasein prevalence with additional alcohol-related conditions ( p /H110210.02). HCV and depression increased in prevalence with additional alcohol-related conditions ( p/H110210.02). We conclude that both a history of alcohol abuse or dependence and hazardous drinking are common amongHIV-positive veterans in care and that both of these con-ditions are associated with increased comorbid disease andsymptoms. Although these conditions are not universallyadditive, there is evidence that their effects may be additivewhen physical symptoms and liver injury are considered.The role of alcohol in determining outcomes in HIV islikely multifaceted, including the timing and intensity ofconsumption and the medical and psychological suscepti-bility of the patient to injury from alcohol. VACS will seekto further understand this relationship by studying patternsof use over time and overlapping and interacting comorbidmedical and psychiatric disease. ESTIMATING THE IMPACT OF ALCOHOL USE ON LONG- TERM HIV OUTCOMES Scott Braithwaite and Amy Justice Numerous studies of HIV-infected patients have shown that alcohol use is associated with decreased adherence toantiretroviral therapies (Chesney, 2000; Chesney et Haubrich et al., 1999a,b; Patersonet al., 2000). Patients who score more than 1 on the CAGEare 3.6 times more likely to miss medication doses (Pater-son et al., 2000). Using VACS 3 data, Wagner et al. (2001)found that any alcohol use was related to missed medica-tion doses (odds ratio, 1.9). The effect of alcohol on long-term HIV outcomes, however, is largely unknown. Alcohol-associated nonadherence may have long-term implicationsbecause nonadherence is a primary cause of treatmentfailure. Paterson reported that when adherence was greaterthan 95%, 22% of patients had a viral rebound comparedwith when adherence was less than 80%, which was asso-ciated with an 80% viral rebound. To model the effect ofdecreased adherence from alcohol use on clinical out-comes, we developed a second-order Monte Carlo com-puter simulation that estimates the life expectancy of HIV-infected patients with current therapies. The simulation isprobabilistic, and it therefore can mimic some of the het-erogeneity seen in clinical populations. All patients werefollowed up until death, and the risk for death was based oncharacteristics including age, CD4 count, and viral load.This simulation offers three major advances over otherHIV models. First, it represents mutations in the HIVALCOHOL USE, ABUSE, AND OUTCOMES AMONG HIV-INFECTED VETERANS 317genome and therefore can predict the time to treatment failure of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)regimens. It represents nonadherence to HAART, whichhas been shown to be the primary cause of virologicalfailure in numerous patient groups and health-care settings.Finally, it has been calibrated and validated with clinicaldata, which increases its generalizability. The model explic-itly represents the two main phenomena that limit theeffectiveness of current therapies: poor adherence and de-velopment of phenotypical resistance. Patients progressthrough sequences of regimens until resistance accrues toall drugs and are at risk for death commensurate with CD4count and regimen efficacy. The magnitude of the associ-ation between alcohol use and nonadherence was based onVACS 3 data (Wagner et al., 2001). Adherent was defined as taking all doses in the past 7 days, nonadherent as missing all doses in the previous 4 days, and partially adherent as neither of these. Times were counted from the start of alltreatments. Our model estimated that adherent patients would have mean life expectancies of 30.7 years, partially adherent patients wouldhave mean life expectancies of 22.0 years, and nonadherentpatients would have mean life expectancies of only 6.8 years. InVACS, 471 patients were not using alcohol. Of these patients,34% were adherent, 59% were partially adherent, and 7% werenonadherent. The 313 alcohol users in VACS had poorer adher-ence (18, 73, and 9%, respectively). On the basis of these adher-ence data, our model estimated life expectancies of 25.1 and 26.8years, respectively, for alcohol users and nonusers with CD4counts of 500. For patients with CD4 counts of 350, our modelestimated that alcohol users and nonusers would have mean lifeexpectancies of 22.2 and 23.9 years, respectively. For patientswith CD4 counts of 200, it estimated that alcohol users andnonusers would have mean life expectancies of 18.8 and 20.2years, respectively. The computer simulation estimated that the poorer adher- ence to antiretroviral therapies among alcohol users in VACS3 would result in more than 1 year of life lost, and this resultwas robust across a wide range of assumptions regardingclinical stage at the start of therapy. This result considers onlythe portion of alcohol 's effect that is mediated through changes in adherence to antiretroviral therapies (Fig. 2) anddoes not consider possible direct effects of alcohol on thecourse of HIV disease or on the risk of death from othercauses. Future VACS data will include more detailed infor-mation on the quantity and pattern of alcohol use and willenroll more patients. These data will permit future runs of thesimulation to consider other important pathways throughwhich alcohol may affect survival in HIV disease. HOMELESSNESS, DRUG & ALCOHOL USE AMONG HIV /H11001 VETERANS Adam Gordon and Robert Cook Homelessness and HIV infection are increasingly recog- nized as important co-occurring conditions. Although esti-mates vary, as many as 30% of HIV-infected persons may be homeless or marginally housed (Smith et al., 2000).Homelessness may decrease adherence among those withaccess to HIV care (Wagner et al., 2001), disrupt access tohealth-care services (Shapiro et al., 1999; Smith et al.,2000), promote sexual and other risky behaviors (Song etal., 2000), and contribute to illicit drug use (Bangsberg etal., 1997; Stein et al., 2000). Alcohol consumption is asso- ciated with many of these same outcomes. Homelessnessand significant alcohol consumption frequently overlap.However, the relative degree to which homelessness andconsumption of alcohol lead to adverse health outcomes inHIV-infected populations is largely unknown. The objec-tives of this study were to compare, by homeless status, therates of alcohol and substance use and to explore theassociation between homelessness, alcohol use, and self-reported utilization of health-care services. We used data from VACS 3 (described previously), which included two measures of homelessness: \"In the past four weeks, have you ever been without a permanent ad-dress that you call home? \"(defined as current homeless- ness) and \"Have you ever been without a permanent ad- dress you call home? \"(defined as past homelessness). To determine alcohol use, we defined hazardous drinking as anAUDIT score /H113508 (Babor et al., 1992) and binge drinking as any positive answer to the third AUDIT question ( \"How often do you have 6 or more drinks on one occasion? \") (Bush et al., 1998; Gordon et al., 2001). Subjects were also Fig. 2. Relationship of alcohol use to HAART medication adherence and outcomes.318 CONIGLIARO ET AL.asked to indicate the number of visits to various health-care providers in the prior 6 months. For our results, the cohort ( n/H11005881) was predominantly male, nonwhite, and middle aged. Overall, 267 (32%) in-dicated prior homelessness, and of those, 53 (20%) werehomeless in the prior 4 weeks. Compared with nonhome-less HIV-infected veterans, homeless HIV-infected veter-ans were younger, were more likely to be minorities, andwere more likely to smoke ( p/H110210.05). Among those who indicated any prior homelessness, 63% drank at hazardouslevels by AUDIT criteria, and 35% binge-drank. Comparedwith persons who were not presently homeless, personswho were homeless in the last 4 weeks ( n/H1100562) had similar rates of current alcohol use (35 vs. 41%; p/H110050.4) and were more likely to be hazardous drinkers by AUDIT criteria (35vs. 19%; p/H110050.002) and to be binge drinkers (47 vs. 34%; p/H110050.04). Compared with nonhomeless HIV-positive veterans, homeless HIV-positive veterans reported, for the prior 6months, an increased mean number of visits to any doctor(6.4 vs. 5.5; p/H110050.003) and to their primary doctor (3.3 vs. 3.0; p/H110050.04). Among the homeless, similar numbers of visits were reported to any doctor in the prior 6 monthsbetween homeless hazardous versus homeless nonhazard-ous drinkers (6.3 vs. 6.3; p/H110051.0), and there was a trend toward fewer visits to their primary doctor among bingeversus non -binge drinkers (3.6 vs. 4.0; p/H110050.07). We conclude that a significant proportion of HIV- infected veterans have a history of homelessness and arecurrently homeless. Homeless HIV-infected veterans weremore likely to drink alcohol at hazardous levels than non-homeless HIV-infected veterans. Homeless status, but notalcohol use status among the homeless, influenced self-reported utilization of any health-care services and of HIVtreatment provider services. Future VACS data will includemore detailed information on homelessness, includinghomeless severity, including typical domiciles (e.g., unshel-tered versus emergency sheltered domiciles). The VACSwill provide an opportunity to study the interaction ofalcohol use disorders and homelessness on a wide range ofalcohol-specific, patient-specific, and process outcomes.Until these studies are conducted, HIV providers should beaware of the prominent role of homelessness, and co-occurring alcohol use, in providing care for HIV-infectedpatients. HEPATITI S C & ALCOHOL IN THE VACS 3 STUDY Shawn Fultz and Kevin Kraemer Hepatitis C (HCV) infection is common in HIV-infected persons (Quan et al., 1993; Sherman et al., 2002; Staples etal., 1999). Because advances in HAART have led to im-proved survival, chronic HCV infection has the opportunityto progress to clinically significant disease in HIV-infectedpersons and is emerging as an important cause of morbidityand mortality (Bica et al., 2001; Klein et al., 2003; Monga etal., 2001). For example, chronic HCV liver disease is now the most common cause of non -AIDS-related death among HIV-infected women (Cohen et al., 2002). Despitethe considerable burden of disease and the high prevalenceof co-infection, factors related to the progression of HCVliver disease in HIV-infected persons are poorly under-stood. Because alcohol use can accelerate the course ofHCV (Poynard et al., 1997), increase the risk of subsequenthepatocellular carcinoma (Khan and Yatsuhashi, 2000),and decrease the efficacy of antiviral treatment (Loguercioet al., 2000), alcohol cessation may be the single mosteffective intervention among co-infected patients and isstrongly recommended (National Institutes of Health Con-sensus Development Conference Statement, 2002). Using VACS 3 data, we determined the prevalence of HCV infection and compared the prevalence of currentdrinking and current hazardous drinking in HIV-infectedveterans with and without HCV co-infection. We also de-termined whether providers were aware of current alcoholand drug use and whether current users were counseled tocut back by their provider. Three hundred (43%) of the 700HIV-infected veterans tested for HCV were HCV infected.HCV-infected veterans were more likely to be of a minorityrace and to be injection drug users and were less likely toreport having sex with men. Eighty-eight (30%) HCV-infected veterans reported current drinking, compared with186 (47%) HCV-negative veterans. However, HCV-infected current drinkers were significantly more likelythan HCV-negative current drinkers to report an AUDITscore of 8 or higher (51 vs. 26%; p/H110210.05) and to report binge drinking (66 vs. 52%; p/H110210.05). Providers recognized only 29 (33%) of the 88 drinkers as currentlydrinking ( /H9260/H110050.07; 18%; specificity, 93%). Only 25 (28.7%) of the HCV patients who were currently drink-ing reported that they had been advised to stop, but pa-tients who were HCV positive were more likely to reporthaving been told to cut back on their drinking comparedwith HCV-negative patients (28.7 and 15.1%, respectively;p/H110210.0005). Among HCV-infected drinkers, those with an AUDIT score of 8 or greater were significantly more likelyto have received advice to cut back than those with scoresless than 8 (73 vs. 14%; p/H110210.005). These results confirm a high prevalence of HCV co- infection in HIV-infected veterans. Unfortunately, approx-imately one third of veterans co-infected with HCV andHIV continue to drink alcohol, often at a hazardous level.Continued alcohol use in these co-infected veterans mayaccelerate the progression of chronic liver disease andadversely affect the efficacy of HAART and interferon-based antiviral HCV therapy. In VACS 3, the problem ofcontinued drinking in veterans co-infected with HCV andHIV was exacerbated by a lack of awareness in health-careproviders. As a result, only one quarter of HCV-infectedpatients who were actively drinking reported being told tostop or cut back. If confirmed in continuing VACS studies,ALCOHOL USE, ABUSE, AND OUTCOMES AMONG HIV-INFECTED VETERANS 319this represents an important gap in the provision of quality health care to these patients. The current VACS study will allow for a more precise quantification of alcohol use and its role in HCV infectionamong veterans with and without HIV infection. Longitu-dinal follow-up in VACS will allow us to prospectivelymeasure the effect of alcohol use on hepatotoxicity, otherclinical liver disease outcomes, and response and adher-ence to HAART and antiviral HCV therapy. These datawill inform our future efforts to develop provider- andsystem-based interventions to overcome barriers to alcoholcessation among all HIV-positive patients, especially thoseco-infected with HCV. SIGNIFICANCE Joseph Conigliaro and Tamra Madenwald With VACS 3 data, alcohol use and hazardous drinking were found to be common in HIV-infected veterans and tobe associated with increased symptom burden, more severecomorbid disease, decreased adherence to treatment, anddecreased utilization of health services in homeless HIV-infected veterans. In addition, health-care providers wereoften unaware of alcohol use in HIV-infected veterans,even in the context of patients with a comorbid conditionsuch as HCV infection, for which abstinence is recom-mended. Similarly, HIV-infected veteran patients whodrink reported seldom being counseled to limit alcohol use. These associated conditions, considered broadly, may have significant implications for HIV-infected veterans,including shortened survival. It is also important to notethat these data suggest that the effects of a history ofalcohol abuse and current hazardous use seem to be addi-tive. Figure 3 is an example of how alcohol affects, asmeasured in the VACS, affect both psychiatric and medicaloutcomes. The role of alcohol in determining outcomesamong HIV-infected veterans is multifaceted and must bebetter defined. Additionally, these preliminary data suggestthat HIV providers need to routinely screen and counselpatients for alcohol use as part of standard care. Providersalso need to screen and perform interventions on HIV-infected veterans, particularly those who are homeless,have another comorbid disease, or are co-infected with HCV. Alcohol-related interventions need to target reducedalcohol consumption and treatment for alcohol use, partic-ularly hazardous drinking and alcohol dependence. The VACS study, with its large and diverse cohort of patients and its significantly improved alcohol measures,will provide an opportunity to characterize the role ofalcohol use and HIV infection in patient outcomes and todevelop effective clinical interventions. VACS will providecritical information needed to inform effective and efficientdesign of large-scale, multisite intervention studies to de-crease the comprehensive harmful effects of alcohol con-sumption on HIV outcomes. These effects likely go wellbeyond the known effects of alcohol on adherence (Cook etal., 2001) and risk behavior (Avins et al., et al., 1994). These data will alsocomplement data emerging from other NIAAA-supportedsmaller-scale alcohol intervention studies focused on de-creasing HIV risk behavior and improving antiretroviraladherence.

An estimated 8.2 million Americans arc dependent on alcohol and 3.6 million on illicit drugs.' Substance abuse is related to almost one third of all newlv dia~nosed ,\\[DS cases2 and Each year, about lllO,()O!) deaths in the United States are related to alcohol consumption and 12,()1lO to illicit drug abuse. 4 At least 72 conditions requiring hospitalization are partiallv or wholly attributable to substance abuse. ~ lor example, alcohol abuse can result in liver disease, cardiomyopathy, hypertension, and upper d~cstive tract malignancies, among others.\" Illicit drug use is a major risk factor for infective endocarditis, chronic viral hepatitis, and AIDS.7 Despite the many documented sub\u00ad stance abuse-related medical conditions and the high societal cost, many drug-and alcohol-dependent persons lack primary medical care. Continuity of care could yield opportunities for preventive, diagnostic, . . . 8 10 E idand therapeutlc Interventions. VI ence suggests that access to primary care has potential to improve not only general health but also drug abuse-related . .e ..outcomes. II I'Desplte th opportuOltleS for benefit, nearly half of all patients pre\u00ad senting for publicly supported substance abuse treatment in one urban center did not have an established primary care relationship.i'' Emergency departments are often the only source of care for many . h ddi 17 18 Th . persons wit a Ictlons.' ese settlOgs rarely have adequate linkages with sub\u00ad stance abuse treatment and primary medical 19 care. Although psychiatric comorbidities and trauma have been well-described, the burden of medical illness in substance\u00ad dependent persons has been minimally examined. Little is known about the frequency, severity, and risk factors for disease in this sizeable group. Better under\u00ad standing of these issues could inform health care providers and policy makers seeking to enhance access to more effective health care for this high risk, vulnerable population. Thus, we sought to assess the burden of medical illness, identify patient and substance dependence characteristics associated with worse physical health, and compare measures of disease burden in drug-and alcohol-dependent persons without primary medical care. METHODS Study Design and Population \\'\\'e performed a cross-sectional analysis of data from patients enrolled in the Health Evaluation and Linkage to Primary care (HELP) study. The HELP study is a randomized, controlled trial assessing the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary clinic for linking patients in a residential detoxification program to primary medical care. All patients in the detoxification unit without a primary care provider were randomized to the intervention, a clinical evaluation in the HELP clinic by a nurse, social worker, and physician, and facilitated referral to an off-site primary care clinic or to standard care. Enrollment took place at an urban inpatient detoxification unit from June 1997 to March 1999. All admissions were screened for eligibility. The Insti\u00ad tutional Review Board at Boston Medical Center approved the study. All patients enrolled in the randomized, controlled trial were included in this cross-sectional study. Eligible patients were eighteen years of age or older and reported alcohol, heroin, or cocaine as first or second drugs of choice. Exclusion criteria were as follows: having a primary care provider and having seen that pro\u00ad vider at least on one occasion in the past two years, pregnancy, Mini-Mental State examination score less than 21, a lack of VOLUME 13 NUMBER 1 JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2004 34 De Alba et al. fluency in either English or Spanish, fewer than three contacts available to facilitate follow-up, or specific plans to leave the Boston area within the next 24 months. Data Collection Trained research associates interviewed patients in the detoxification unit 24--48 hours post-admission. The interview included a 60-90 minute questionnaire on sociodemographics and medical and sub\u00ad stance abuse history. The questionnaire was translated into Spanish, back translated into English, and checked for accuracy. Independent Variables Sociodemographic characteristics, prob\u00ad lem substances, and substance abuse severity were the variables of interest. Sociodemographics included age, gender, racefethnicity, primary language (English, Spanish, or other), place of birth (United States or other), income, education, marital status, living alone in the past six months, and occupation. We also recorded employ\u00ad ment pattern and health insurance in the previous six months. Homelessness was defined as spending one or more nights in an overnight shelter or on the street in the previous six months. Annual income was categorized into the following three groups, according to maximum earnings in any of the previous five years: low income (less than $20,000), inter\u00ad mediate income ($20,000 to $50,000), and higher income (more than $50,000). Problem drug use was defined as any illicit drug use, or alcohol to intoxication, three or more times per week for a year or more or five times in the previous month. Substance dependence diagnoses per se were not determined in this sample of patients admitted for inpatient detoxification. Substances considered were: alcohol, cocaine, heroin, opiates other than heroin, cannabis, amphetamines, hallucinogens, inhalants, barbiturates, and sedatives. Addiction severity was assessed using the Addiction Severity Index (ASI)2o and the Alcohol Dependence Scale (ADS).21 The ADS has a range from zero to 47, with higher values indicating more dependence. Variables of interest were the ASI alcohol and drug composite scores, years of problem substance use, average number of drinks per day in the past month, and injection drug use. The ASI-alcohol and ASI-drug scores have a range from zero to one, with larger values indicating greater severity of use. Dependent Variables The primary dependent variable of interest was burden of medical illness assessed by the Physical Component Sum\u00ad mary (PCS) score and physical health scale scores from the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36).22 The SF-36 was designed for use in clinical practice and research and include individual multi-item scales that assess eight health concepts: 1. limitations in physical activities because of health problems 2. limitations in social activities because of physical or emotional problems 3. limitations in usual role activities because of physical health problems 4. bodily pain 5. general mental health (psychological distress and well-being) 6. limitations in usual role activities because of emotional problems 7. vitality (energy and fatigue) 8. general health perceptions. 22 The PCS is a summary measure consider\u00ad ing only the SF-36 components that are related to physical health. We also used the medical composite score from the Addiction Severity Index (ASI-medicall3 and self-report of one or more physician-diagnosed chronic conditions as THE AMERICAN JOURNAL ON ADDICTIONS 35 Burden of Medical Illness I1l Addiction additional burden of medical illness mea\u00ad sures. The ASI-medical score has a range from zero (no need for treatment) to one (greatest severity of medical problems). Statistical Analysis All analyses were performed using SAS statistical software (SAS Institute, Cary, ~C). The data analysis was done in four phases. First, descriptive statistics were generated for each study variable. Second, mean pes scores in study participants. acljusrcd for the age distri\u00ad bution in the L' .S. population were com\u00ad pared to the general ('.S. population stratified by gendcr.22 Third, to identify risk factors for increased burden of illness, we performed hi variate and multi variable analyses. Chi-square tests were used to compare categorical variables and t-tests or Pearson correlation analyses (or Spearman rank tests, as appropriate) for continuous variables. In a secondary analysis, we com\u00ad pared the frequency of problem alcohol and heroin use, ASI-medical scores, and frequency of medical conditions between men and women. Three multivariable regression models were constructed, one for each dependent variable. We used linear regression for the PCS and ASI-medical scores and logistic regression for the presence of chronic conditions. Variables significant at p :::;; 0.2 in bivariate analysis or considered to be clinically relevant were entered into the regression models. Fourth, the three burden of .medical illness measures were compared using Pearson correlation analyses. RESULTS Demographics Of a total of 2,062 screened patients admitted for detoxification, 1,420 (68%) were excluded because of an established primary care relationship (n= 978), living outside the Boston area (II = 204), having fewer than three contacts available (II = <) l) or a Mini-Mental State score of < 21 (II = 58), pregnancy (11= 51), or other reasons (11=38). Twenty-seven per\u00ad cent (172/642) of eligible subjects refused to participate. The study included 470 individuals without primary medical care (see Table 1). The mean age was 35.7 years (SD 7.8). English was the first language for 89% of participants, and Spanish was for 8%. Eighty seven percent were born in the United States. \\'(lhile only 8()I\" were married, most had children (70%) and lived with someone (78'1.,). Eighty-t\\vO percent of subjects had problem use of more than one substance (see Table 2). Alcohol problem use was the most common; more men than women reported problem alcohol drinking (90% vs 74%, P< 0.001). The mean AST\u00ad alcohol score was 0.5 (SD 0.3), the AOS (Alcohol Dependence Scale) score was 1(l.8 (SD 1.8), and the average number of drinks per day in the month prior to detoxification was 21 (SD 20). Sixty-five percent had problem cocaine use and 38% problem heroin use. There was no gender difference in frequency of problem heroin use (men, 38%; women, 40%; p = 0.731). The mean ASI-drug score was 0.2 (SD 0.1), and 36% reported a history of injection drug use. Burden of Medical Illness The mean PCS (Physical Component Summary) score in study subjects was 48.1 (SD 10.75). After adjusting for age, the mean score for study participants was on average 6 points lower than the mean for the general U.S. population (44.1 vs 50, P< 0.001). The mean and age-adjusted PCS scores for men in the study were 49.1 and 44.9, respectively (see Figure 1). Female subjects had a mean and age\u00ad adjusted PCS score of 44.9 and 41.4, respectively (see Figure 2). 36 VOLUME 13 NUMBER 1 JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2004 De Alba et al. TABLE 1.

Bivariate Analyses The following sociodemographic vari\u00ad ables were significantly associated with worse physical health status (lower pes scores) in bivariate analyses: older age, unemployment, female gender, living alone, having medical insurance, and low income (data not shown). Problem use of heroin and other opiates, barbiturates, hallucinogens, and cannabis, as well as addiction severity reflected by the ADS, the ASI-alcohol score, number of drinks in the previous month, and ever using injection drugs, were also significantly associated with worse physical health status. Multivariable Analyses As shown in Table 4, the following variables were associated with worse physical health (lower pes scores) in a multivariable analysis: female gender (adjusted mean change in pes score: -3.71 points), problem use of hallucinogens (-3.51), heroin (-2.94), or other opiates (-3.20), living alone (-3.15), having THE AMERICAN JOURNAL ON ADDICTIONS 39 Burden of Medical '\"ness In Addiction 90 841 83.8 809 80 751 71.9 70 60 General popula60n ~ 50 0 ell Alcohol-and drug-dependent persons \"\";!hout primary care ~ 40 ~ 30 20 10 0 Physical Physical Role Pain General Heanh Funclioning p older age (-0.22 points per year). Independent risk factors for worse health as measured by the other two measu res, A SI-medical score and a presence of a chronic condition, differed from risk factors for worse health as measured by the PCS. Problem alcohol use and having medical insurance were risk factors for worse physical health as assessed by the ASI-medical score. RaceJethnicity other than White, Black, or Hispanic; having medical insurance; and older age increased the risk of having a chronic condition. Comparison Among Burden of Medical Illness Measures We found a moderate negative corre\u00ad lation between the PCS and AS I-medical scores (r = -0.54, P= 0.001), but low cor\u00ad relations between the PCS scores and presence of a chronic condition (r = -0.29, P= 0.001) and between the ASI-medical score and presence of chronic condition (r =0.33, P=0.001 ). DISCUSSION Drug- and alcohol-dependent persons without primary care have a significant burden of medical illness. In this young sample, most had previous hospitalizations for medical problems, almost half reported having a chronic medical condition, and one in three reported an episodic medical illness in the past six months. Physical health status, as measured by the Phy\u00ad sical Component Summary (PCS) of the Short Form health survey, was worse than in the general U.S. population. Several factors were associated with worse physical health in this population. We found significantly lower pes scores among women; persons with problem use of heroin, hallucinogens, and other opiates; 40 VOLUME 13 NUMBER 1 JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2004 De Alba et al. TABLE J.

The magnitude of the difference in pes scores between this sample and the general popu\u00ad lation was greater than the decline caused by many chronic conditions such as angina, chronic lung disease, diabetes mellitus, and myocardial infarction.22 The annual inci\u00ad dence rate of pneumonia and prevalence rates of peptic ulcer, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and stroke among study subjects are more than double the rates found in similar age strata in the general population.f\" The incidence rates for syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia in the previous six months among study partici\u00ad pants are more than double the annual rates reported in civilian populations by state health departments.zs ~ Differential impact of substance abuse by gender has been documented particu\u00adlarly with regard to alcohol. As compared to men, women In previous studies had higher risk of developing cirrhosis, alcoholic h~atitis,2() cardiomyopathy, and rnyopathy. ' Our findings suggest that regardless of the drug of choice, women with substance dependence suffer from worse physical health. As is the case with alcohol, susceptibility to the adverse health effects of other drugs may be greater in women than in men. Heroin and opiates have been associated with many medical complications and unhealthy lifestyle choices.f but the effect of hallucinogens on physical health status is less well known. We do not know if specific types of hallucinogens had a greater impact than others on burden of illness since hallucinogen types were not asked. Social factors like living alone and being unemployed have been reported to be associ- VOLUME 13 NUMBER 1 JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2004 42 ated with an increased burden of medical illness28,29 The fact that having medical insurance was associated with increased burden may sound counterintuitive, but having insurance may have made subjects more likely to know about and therefore report the presence of medical conditions. Alternatively, worse health may have led subjects to be more likely to have health insurance. Disability would make them eli\u00ad gible for Medicaid. More frequent presen\u00ad tation to health care may have increased the likelihood that institutions would facilitate enrollment in public health plans. We did not find an association between drug of choice and having health insurance to suggest differential impact of employability by drug ofchoice. Older age is known to be associated with worse physical health. The measures chosen in this study to assess burden of medical illness had only low to moderate correlation with one another. The association was moderate between the PCS and ASI-medical scores, but both correlated poorly with the presence of a chronic condition. Some studies using SF-36-based instruments have shown a detrimental effect of substance abuse on physical health scores,30-32 but . 33-35hers have sown li 1 ot h tt e or no impact. For instance, in a cross-sectional study among 1,333 primary care patients, alcohol use frequency, quantity, abuse, or depen\u00ad dence did not affect PCS scores, and only dependence affected SF-36 scale scores. 36 Among crack cocaine users, the baseline SF-36 scores had no decline during a two-year period despite continued drug use. Additionally, the physical role, vitality, general health, and emotional role scale scores were not affected by frequency of crack use.3? Whether the lack of impact on health in these two cases truly represents no impact on health or is due to low sensitivity of the scale in this population is not clear. In our study, the PCS was able to detect a significant decrease in health. Seemingly, the PCS, the ASI-medical De Alba et al. score, and the presence of a chronic con\u00ad dition assess illness burden from different perspectives and may be complementary. It is not clear which scale is best suited to assess medical illness burden in persons with alcohol or drug dependence. Our findings suggest that each may have value but that one alone may be inadequate. Measures to assess burden of illness in this specific population need to be further developed. Several limitations of the present study should be considered. The inferences about the causal relationship between risk factor and increased burden of medical illness are limited by the cross-sectional design of the study. Chronic conditions were assessed by self-report but had to be physician diagnosed. Interviews administered shortly after admission to detoxification, when patients were in physical and mental dis\u00ad tress, might adversely impact PCS and ASI-medical scores, but subjects were inter\u00ad viewed only after acute symptoms subsi\u00ad ded. Subjects were not characterized in terms of substance use disorder diagnoses using DSM-IV criteria, which may make comparisons difficult with other studies. However, given the clinical setting, reasons for admission, and results on other measures, all were likely substance dependent. Lastly, the results presented might not be applicable to persons not included in the study, like pregnant women, persons with dementia or not in a detoxification unit, and users whose drug of choice is not alcohol, cocaine, or heroin. But the severity of medical illness among our sample as reflected by ASI-medical scores was comparable to other drug-dependent persons at admission to detoxification programs.30 Drug-and alcohol-dependent patients are a vulnerable underserved population with a significant burden of medical illness. Given the potential for effective interventions to decrease this burden (ie, screening and early treatment of sexually THE AMERICAN JOURNAL ON ADDICTIONS 43 Burden of Medical Illness In Addiction transmitted diseases, tuberculosis, and HtV; hepatitis and pneumococcal vaccines), enhanced efforts should be made to increase linkage to comprehensive and longitudinal primary medical care. The results of our studv help to characterize the magnitude of medical burden and identify pel'sons at greatest risk for worse physical health among persons with alcohol and drug dependence without primary medical care; they may also inform the design of improved linkage strategies and medical services aimed at this ropulation.

THE AMERICAN JOURNAL ON ADDIOIONS 45 ORIGINAL ARTICLE A Pilot Trial of a Telecommunications System in Sleep Apnea Management Deborah A. DeMolles, BA, * David Sparrow, DSc, *t Daniel J. Gottlieb, MD, MPH, *t and Robert Friedman, MDt Background: Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is an effective therapy for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), although many patients have difficulty adhering to this therapy. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of totally automated telephone technology in improving adherence to pre\u00ad scribed CPAP therapy. Research Design: This pilot study was a randomized clinical trial in 30 patients being started on CPAP therapy for OSAS. Patients were randomly assigned to use of a computer telephone system designed to improve CPAP adherence (telephone-linked communi\u00ad cations for CPAP [TLC-CPAP]) in addition to usual care (n = 15) or to usual care alone (n = 15) for a period of2 months. TLC-CPAP is a computer-based system that monitors patients' self-reported behavior and provides education and reinforcement through a struc\u00ad tured dialogue. . Measures: A sleep symptoms checklist and the Functional Out\u00ad comes of Sleep Questionnaire were administered at study entry and at 2-month follow up. Hours of CPAP use at effective mask pressure were measured by the CPAP device, stored in its memory. and retrieved at the 2-month visit. Results: At 2 months, patients randomized to TLC-CPAP had fewer reported sleep-related symptoms (9.4 vs. 13.4, P = 0.047) than those receiving usual care. The average nightly CPAP use in the TLC-CPAP group was 4.4 hours compared with 2.9 hours (P = 0.076) in the usual-care group. Conclusions: This pilot study suggests that patients with OSAS started on CPAP and a concurrently administered automated educa\u00ad tion and counseling system had better CPAP adherence and better control of OSAS symptoms.

I Affected persons experi\u00ad ence substantial neurobehavioral morbidity, including exces\u00ad sive daytime sleepiness, decreased vigilance, increased auto accidents, impaired quality of life (QOL), and depression. In addition, OSAS has been implicated as a risk factor for hypertension.r\" cardiovascular disease,\"? and all-cause mor\u00ad tality.8,9 The initial treatment ofchoice for most patients with OSAS is nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) applied by mask during sleep. This therapy has been shown to reduce the frequency ofapnea, hypopnea, and oxygen desatu\u00ad ration during sleep, thereby reducing sleep disruption.l?:'! These effects lead in turn to reduced daytime sleepiness and improved vigilance and QOL.1I -13 Unfortunately, patient adherence to the prescribed use of CPAP is often poor, diminishing the potential benefits of this therapy. Of patients started on nasal CPAP for OSAS, 20% to 33% discontinue CPAP use within 3 to 4 months. 14,15 Even among patients who do not totally discontinue CPAP use soon after it is prescribed, use is less than optimal. 14,16,1 7 Patients could discontinue or underuse CPAP therapy for many reasons: inadequate comprehension of the rationale for therapy, including the expected long-term outcomes of CPAP use; side effects; and a lack of knowledge on how to ameliorate these side effects. Patient adherence during the first month after initiation of CPAP therapy is a powerful predictor of long-term adherence.l ':\" and many patients quickly abandon CPAP or start using it only sporadically during the first month. Thus, to enhance long-term adherence, it is crucial to improve patients' understanding of the ex\u00ad pected benefits of CPAP use, recognize and address side effects, and monitor and promote adherence to CPAP therapy during the initial period of use. Side effects of CPAP use are common, although gen\u00ad erally minor, and include mask discomfort, dryness of the nose and throat, machine noise, eye irritation, skin redness or ulceration from pressure or allergy, discomfort from applied pressure, claustrophobia, and belching or air swallow\u00ad ing.15,18,19 Many of these effects, once recognized, are ame- Medical Care.

Telephone-linked communications (fLC) systems of\u00ad fer an effective, low-cost, convenient, and easy-to-use way of providing information, advice, and counseling to improve patient adherence for important health-related behaviors.\" In previous studies, we have demonstrated I) the applicability of TLC technology in the care of adults with a wide variety of chronic health conditions2 122 and 2) its efficacy in modifying patient health behavior (medication-taking, diet, and exer\u00ad cise).20.21,23 We designed and constructed a new TLC system for promoting adherence to CPAP that implements and expands on the recommendations of a recent American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) consensus statement that patient education and monitoring are important, at least during the first month of therapy, to promote long-term adherence to CPAP therapy.\" We have developed the TLC-CPAP system as an automated, telephone-based, and low-cost intervention modeled on the personnel-intensive intervention of Hoy et al.2S To obtain preliminary evidence of the feasibility and efficacy of the TLC-CPAP system, we conducted a pilot study of TLC-CPAP among adults with OSAS who were being started on nasal CPAP therapy. METHODS Telephone-Linked Communication Technology The TLC technology is a computer-based telecommu\u00ad nications system that functions as an at-home cator, and counselor to improve health-related behaviors.\" TLC speaks to patients over the telephone through computer\u00ad controlled digitized human speech. The patients respond by using the touchtone keypad of their telephones. This type of telephonic technology is often called an interactive voice response (IVR) system. TLC asks questions, monitors the patient's self-reported behavior, and provides education and behavioral reinforcement for targeted health-related behav\u00ad iors. After detailed analysis of actual conversations, TLC conversations have been designed to emulate telephone con\u00ad versations between patients and health professionals. The words used by TLC to express a particular question or response vary from conversation to conversation to keep the dialogue interesting and as much like human speech as possible. Like other TLC applications, we designed TLC-CPAP to improve adherence to therapy. The TLC-CPAP content is based on patterns of CPAP adherence'Y'? and side-effect 18profiles1S ,19,26 identified in prior studies. The overall out\u00ad line and sequence ofa TLC-CPAP call is shown in Figure 1. For this study, patients were asked to make their first TLC\u00ad CPAP call 3 days after starting CPAP therapy (3-day call) and thereafter weekly (I-week call) for a total of 2 months. \u00a9 2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Salutation ,r Password \" Collect data on CPAP adherence Iflow adherence, identify cause(s) Identify side effects or persistentOSAS symptoms to Counseling re: - CPAP utilization - Need to consultphysician FIGURE 1, Outline of a typical telephone-linked communica\u00ad tions for continuous positive airway pressure conversation. Calls could be made at any time of day that was convenient for the user. If a patient did not make a call to TLC on a scheduled day, TLC called that person the next day, repeating calls periodically during a time period set with the user. If 2 days elapsed from the day of the scheduled call, the system administrator was notified automatically and informed the research assistants working on the project, who then would follow up with the patient to determine why the call was not made. At the beginning of a call, the user was instructed to enter a personal password, similar to an ATM password, to ensure security and confidentiality. After the confirmed iden\u00ad tification of the user, TLC began with an assessment of the frequency and duration of CPAP use during the previous Copvnqht :<:; l.rppincott WilliarTlS & \\;Vilkins.

If a patient reported nonuse of the CPAP, or use for fewer than 4 hours per night (on nights they used it) or fewer than 5 nights per week (or fewer than 2 nights in the case of the 3-day call), the system proceeded to ask a series of questions aimed at identifying the cause of CPAP non\u00ad adherence (side effects, difficulty using CPAP, lack of per\u00ad ceived benefit, machine malfunction). When CPAP side ef\u00ad fects were identified, the severity of each was ascertained. If a patient reported adequate CPAP adherence, the ensuing dialogue reinforced this behavior and then identified the presence of CPAP side effects, if any. Starting with the first l-week call, for both CPAP\u00ad adherent and -nonadherent patients, the system ascertained the severity of OSAS-related symptoms, including snoring, breathing pauses, and daytime sleepiness. If the patient re\u00ad ported side effects or OSAS symptoms, the system would recommend that the patient contact his or her physician to discuss these problems. At this point in the call, the TLC\u00ad CPAP system provided a brief counseling dialogue, focusing on appropriate CPAP use, expected benefits, correct CPAP operating technique, and potential side effects and their treatment. Reinforcement of the need for regular CPAP use was provided at the end of the dialogue (except when a patient had been instructed by a physician to discontinue CPAP), reminding the patient that CPAP use would likely reduce daytime sleepiness and could also have the additional benefit of reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. Routine printed reports were sent to the patients' phy\u00ad sicians biweekly. These reports included information on the frequency and duration ofCPAP use, side effects, and OSAS symptoms. In addition, reports were sent during unscheduled weeks when a patient reported CPAP underuse (for the 3-day call, less than 6 hours over the 3 days; for a l-week call, less than 4 hours per night on nights the CPAP was used or less than 5 nights per week) or side effects, including mask discomfort, dryness of the nose and throat, claustrophobia, and belching or air swallowing, deemed by the patient to be of moderate-to-severe intensity. Notification was sent to the physician if a patient reported discontinuing CPAP at the physician's instruction to confirm that instruction. Study Sample Potential participants were adults starting nasal CPAP therapy through a collaborating home care company (North Atlantic Medical Services, Leominster, MA). To be included in the study, a person had to be aged 18 years or older, English-speaking, have a physician diagnosis of OSAS, and have polysornnography demonstrating> 15episodes ofapnea or hypopnea per hour of sleep. Individuals who met these criteria were contacted by a therapist from the home care company by telephone to ask whether they were willing to have a member of the research team speak with them about 766 the study. Patients who agreed were visited by a member of the research team in the person's home along with the therapist initiating CPAP therapy. After the therapist had completed the CPAP setup, including the usual patient edu\u00ad cation and demonstration of equipment use, the research assistant described the research study and invited the subject to participate. Informed consent was obtained, including consent for release of the sleep study report to the investiga\u00ad tors. Individuals were excluded if they reported prior CPAP use. At the conclusion of a baseline examination (see the description of study measures subsequently), eligible partic\u00ad ipants were randomized to either TLC and usual medical care or usual medical care alone. Subjects assigned to the TLC intervention group were trained to use TLC. A total of 30 subjects were enrolled (15 in each group). All subjects com\u00ad pleted a 2-month follow-up evaluation. This research was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Boston University Medical Center. Data Collection Data for analysis were collected during the 2 home visits done 2 months apart. At the baseline examination, height and weight were measured, and subjects completed a checklist of sleep symptoms and the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ). At the 2-month examination, the questionnaires were readministered and hours of CPAP use were recorded from a meter. The FOSQ is a self-reported measure designed to assess the impact of disorders of excessive sleepiness on multiple activities of daily living.27 The Sleep Symptoms Checklist developed by a research group at the Scottish National Sleep Laboratory\" measures the frequency of 9 sleep-related symptoms using a 6-point Likert scale, ranging from \"never\" = 0 to \"always\" = 5. The Sleep Symptoms Checklist score is calculated by adding the responses for the 9 items (maxi\u00ad mal possible score = 45). The average hours per night of CPAP use at effective mask pressure is a primary outcome measure for this study. All devices used in this study were capable of measuring the daily CPAP use at effective mask pressure defined as a pressure within 2 cm of the prescribed CPAP pressure.l''''\" The use-time data stored in the CPAP device memory were retrieved at the 2-month in-home visit. Data Analysis All data analysis was performed using SAS 6.12 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). Differences between intervention and control groups in the mean values of the outcome measures were analyzed using independent-sample I tests. Analysis of covariance was used to adjust for differences between the groups in baseline characteristics. Because pre\u00ad vious research indicates that an adverse impact on CPAP adherence, OSAS symptoms, or QOL resulting from in\u00ad creased monitoring and education is unlikely,2S,28-3o the null Lippincott Williams & Wilkins C'T/; III!

Medical Care Volume 42, Number 8, August 2004 Telecommunications System for Sleep Apnea hypothesis of no effect of TLC-CPAP was tested in relation to the directional alternative hypothesis of improvement in these outcome measures. 31 RESULTS At baseline, intervention and usual-care subjects had similar characteristics; there were no differences at P <0.05 level (Table 1) .. During the 2 months after study entry, the average nightly use ofCPAP (averaged across all nights in the study period) was 4.4 hours in the TLC-CPAP intervention group and 2.9 hours in the usual-care group (Table 2). At baseline, intervention and usual-care patients had similar Sleep Symp\u00ad toms Checklist scores and disease-specific QOL as measured by the FOSQ. After 2 months, TLC-CPAP patients had lower Sleep Symptom Checklist scores (9.4 vs. 13.4; P = 0.047) (with lower scores indicating fewer symptoms) than usual\u00ad care patients, although there remained little difference in the FOSQ scores (Table 2). Adjustment for baseline characteris\u00ad tics (Table 1) using analysis of covariance had little effect on the results of Table 2. The 15 patients in the TLC-CPAP group participated in the trial for a mean of9.2 weeks. Given the prescribed calling plan, we would have expected patients to make an average of 9.3 calls during the trial, but in fact they made an average of 7.9 calls to the system (85%). Of the 7.9 calls made per patient, on average 2.7 calls were made late with 1.5 calls being made after receiving an automated reminder call from the system, whereas another 1.2 calls required a research assistant to follow up after allowing 2 automated reminder calls to be placed. DISCUSSION These pilot study results show promising differences between the intervention and usual-care groups, although the small sample size precludes statistical certainty.

The average nightly CPAP use was 1.5 hours greater in the intervention group than in the usual-care group for the duration of the study. Although this difference was not statistically signifi\u00ad cant in this small, pilot study, an effect of this magnitude would be of potentially great clinical significance, because it reflects an approximately 30% increase in average nightly CPAP use over that reported in most clinical trials ofCPAP. In other studies, the average nightly duration of CPAP use is significantly correlated with degree of improvement in OSAS symptoms, daytime sleepiness, and general health-related quality of lifey\u00b732 At follow up, the TLC-CPAP patients' Sleep Symptoms Checklist score was 4 points lower than that of the usual-care group, indicating fewer sleep-related symp\u00ad toms. There was no significant difference between groups in disease-specific QOL as measured by the FOSQ. The TLC technology offers a low-cost and easy-to-use means of promoting adherence to CPAP. The rationale for frequent, early monitoring of CPAP use is based on the observation that by 1 month after initiation of therapy, pat\u00ad terns ofCPAP use are firmly established.Jv'? Indeed, recent evidence suggests that a pattern ofregular CPAP use could be established as early as the first week of therapy and that discomfort from the CPAP device is an important predictor of irregular use.\" Our TLC-CPAP intervention was modeled on the intervention of Hoy et a1. 2S These investigators conducted a randomized, controlled trial of an intensive support inter\u00ad vention among 80 patients with OSAS using CPAP for the first time. The intervention included initial education, an extra 2-night CPAP titration protocol (subsequent to the initial CPAP titration study) to adjust pressure settings, and periodic home visits, mostly during the initial month, by a specially trained nurse. CPAP use was measured by pressure-time meters installed in the CPAP machines. Patients in the inter\u00ad.. vention group had higher average nightly use of CPAP over 6 months than did control patients (5.4 ::!: 0.3 vs. 3.8 ::!: 0.4 \u00a9 2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins C<)!'vriqht ; L'PrJn::ctl Wi!l!arns & WilkinS Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited. 767 DeMolles et al Medical Care Volume 42, Number 8, August 2004 hours [mean :t standard error of mean], respectively, P= 0.003). Patients in the intervention group also had fewer sleep symptoms at the 6-month follow up (7 :t I vs. 10 :t I) as measured by the Sleep Symptoms Checklist. The intervention also led to improvements in mood and simple unprepared reaction time. Although the authors could not be sure which component(s) of the intervention accounted for the improve\u00ad ments seen, their impression was that the extra 2-night titra\u00ad tion added little. Other studies of interventions to increase CPAP use have provided conflicting results but have had important methodologic limitations. In an uncontrolled retrospective study, Likar et al. 28 observed that a single 2-hour educational session led to an increase in CPAP use as measured by run-time metering among 25 OSAS patients. Fletcher and Lucketr\" perfoimed a randomized, controlled trial of the impact of human telephone support on objective CPAP use among 10 OSAS patients newly started on this therapy. During the initial 3 months of the intervention, the 6 subjects in the intervention group had somewhat greater CPAP use than did the 4 control subjects (6.6 :t 1.8 vs. 5.6 :t 3.9 hours/night [mean :t standard deviation], respectively), al\u00ad though this difference was not statistically significant. After crossover between experimental conditions, no difference was seen after an additional 3 months. Both the very small sample size and a crossover design that would tend to diminish intervention effects ifthe benefits ofthe intervention were sustained limit interpretation of this study. Finally, Chervin et al.30 reported that OSAS patients who received weekly telephone calls or an educational intervention had greater adherence to CPAP than did a usual-care control group. This study, however, had important methodologic limitations, including a substantially lower severity of OSAS and less severe subjective and objective sleepiness at entry in control subjects than in subjects in either intervention group. In our study, we observed increased CPAP use (1.5 hours/night more in TLC-CP AP users) similar to that in the study of Hoy et al. 25 described previously. The reduction in Sleep Symptoms Checklist score demonstrated in our data is greater than that observed by Hoy et al.25 Thus, these pre\u00ad liminary data suggest that TLC-CPAP use leads to an in\u00ad crease in CPAP adherence and an improvement in sleep apnea symptoms similar to those of the more personnel\u00ad intensive program ofHoy et a1.2 5 Despite the face validity of the Sleep Symptoms Checklist as a measure ofclinical OSAS severity, data relating checklist scores to other measures of clinical outcome are limited. To put these results in a clinical context, using the approach suggested by Cohen for interpret\u00ad ing effect size defined as the mean difference/standard devi\u00ad ation of the difference, the effect size of 0.64 for the Sleep Symptoms Checklist is suggestive of moderate clinical sig\u00ad nificance.P In the study by Hoy et aI., the similar improve\u00ad ments in CPAP use and Sleep Symptoms Checklist scores were associated with both subjective improvement in mood and objective improvement in reaction time.2 5 Another way to put these results in context is to compare the effect of the TLC-CPAP intervention to the overall effect of CPAP treat\u00ad ment on OSAS symptoms. The effect observed in this study was 27% as great as that observed for CPAP therapy in a group of 62 OSAS patients studied by Kingshott et al., who were similar in age, body mass index, and baseline Sleep Symptoms Checklist score to the subjects of the present study.32 The effect of the TLC-CPAP intervention on FOSQ score had an effect size of0.34, consistent with small clinical significance. 33 In summary, adherence to nasal CPAP prescribed for OSAS is often poor, limiting the health benefits of this expensive therapy. Nurse-administered patient education and monitoring ofCPAP use through home visits has been shown to be effective in significantly improving CPAP adherence; however, given the logistic complexity and cost of delivering this service, it is unlikely to be disseminated widely in clinical practice. The current study provides preliminary evidence that the use of advanced telecommunications tech\u00ad nology to perform patient education and monitoring provides an acceptable and inexpensive alternative that could produce a similar improvement in CPAP adherence.

Keywords: Human immunodeciency virus; Alcohol; Condom use; Generalized estimating equations 1. Introduction While the diagnosis of human immunodeciency virus (HIV) infection may lead to the initiation of either safersex or sexual abstinence ( Pierret, 2000 ), unsafe sexual be- havior remains common among people with HIV, as doc-umented by both self-report and by laboratory tests forsexually-transmitted infections (STI) ( studies of HIV-infected patients revealed a 12% prevalence of STI in Atlanta ( Kalichman et al., 2000 ), and a gonorrhea or chlamydia infectionin address: jsamet@bu.edu (J.H. Samet).HIV-related morbidity and mortality have been reduced by the use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) ( Palella et al., 1998).Atthesametime,theavailabilityoftreatmenthelped fuel the belief that undetectable viral load precludes viraltransmission, leading to decreased vigilance in adhering tosafer sexual practices ( Kalichman et al., 2001; Katz et al., 2002). This complacency is an important public health con- cern, as it promotes the spread of sexually-transmitted in-fections, including HIV and its resistant strains ( Little et al., 2002). While sharing contaminated injection instruments is an efcient mode of HIV transmission, unprotected sexual in-tercourse is the most 'universally available' mode, facili-tating HIV spread beyond traditional risk groups. Unsafesexual practices in non-HIV-infected populations have beenlinked to illicit drug use ( Buchacz et al., 2001; Woods et al., 1996, 2000 ), African-American ethnicity ( Buchacz et al., 2001), ( Buchacz et al., 2001 ), 0376-8716/$ - see front matter \u00a9 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Ehrenstein et al./Drug and Alcohol Dependence 73 (2004) 159-166 younger age ( Buchacz et al., 2001 ), and depressive symp- toms (Skrondal et al., 2000 ). While not universally supported by published data (Messiah et al., 1998; Weatherburn et al., 1993 ), the as- sociation of alcohol with unsafe sex in HIV-uninfectedpersons has been described both generally ( Caetano and Hines, 1995; McEwan et al., 1992) and in special popula- tions, such as young adults ( Bagnall et al., 1990; Graves, 1995; Seage et ), drug users ( Rees et al., 2001; Stein et al., 2000 ), and bisexual men ( Wold et al., 1998 ). Active alcohol use as a risk factor for risky sexual behavioris suggested by Scheidt (1999) , who found that compared with the pre-treatment period of active alcohol use, subjectshad fewer sexual partners after substance abuse treatment. AmongthosewhoareinfectedwithHIV,riskysexualbe- haviorcanleadtoadverseoutcomes.Ontheindividuallevel,it increases the risk of re-infection with a potentially drugresistant strain of HIV. From the public health perspective,unsafe sex facilitates the spread of HIV infection. Althoughthe role of alcohol use in relation to unsafe sex has beenstudied in non-HIV-infected special populations, its impactinpersonswithHIVhasnotbeenfullyexplored.Prevalenceof HIV infection among alcoholics is higher than that in thegeneral population ( Avins et al., 1994; Woods et al., 2000 ). At the same time, studies report over 40% prevalence of al-coholproblemsamongHIV-infectedpersons( Lefevreetal., 1995;Samet et al., in press ). These ndings underscore the importance of understanding the impact of alcohol use onunsafe sexual behaviors in HIV-infected persons, particu-larly since sexual transmission of HIV is, in principle, pre-ventable. Our principal hypothesis in this study was that, inHIV-infected persons with a history of alcohol problems,high current alcohol consumption is associated with higherrisk of inconsistent condom use. In order to better assessalcohol'sindependenteffectonthisbehavioraloutcome,wecontrolled for other subject characteristics, such as injectiondrug use (IDU), sexual orientation, partner status, gender,education, and ethnic origin. 2. Methods 2.1. Study design &data collection Participants ( n=349) were recruited between July 1997 and July 2001 into the HIV-Alcohol Longitudinal cohort, afollow-upstudyofHIV-infectedpatientswithpastorcurrenthistoryofalcoholproblems.Participantshaduptosevenin-terviews,withthebaselinevisitgenerallyoccurringwithin2weeks of initial screening and subsequent interviews sched-uled at 6-month intervals. No follow-up occurred after July2001. Structured face-to-face condential interviews were ad- ministered in English or Spanish by trained staff. For theSpanishinterviews,standardizedscalesinSpanishwereusedwhenavailable;theremainingportionsofthequestionnaireswere translated from English, back-translated to check for accuracy,andcorrected.LaboratoryvaluesofHIVRNAandCD4 cell counts measured within 3 months of each visitwere obtained from medical records whenever available. Ifnot available, blood samples were drawn during the visitby nursing staff. Most interviews took place at the Gen-eral Clinical Research Center of Boston University Schoolof Medicine. Participants were compensated US$ 20 or anequivalent gift certicate to a local grocery store. Institu-tionalReviewBoardsofBostonMedicalCenter(BMC)andBeth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) approvedthe study. 2.2. Participants 2.2.1. Recruitment sites All participants resided in the Greater Boston area. The majority of participants were recruited as they initiated HIVmedical care at BMC's HIV Diagnostic Evaluation Unit, aclinic that provided multidisciplinary initial evaluation forHIV-infected persons ( Samet et al., 1995 ). Other subjects were recruited from the following sites: primary care clin-ics at BMC and BIDMC; a methadone clinic in Boston; arespite facility for homeless persons; referrals by friends;media announcements and flyers placed in HIV/AIDS so-cial service agencies in the Boston area. Persons recruitedoutside BMC or BIDMC were pre-screened by telephone,andpotentiallyeligibleindividualswereinvitedtocompletethe screening process in person. 2.2.2. Eligibility The inclusion criteria were: (1) conrmed HIV infection; and (2) a history of alcohol problems as determined eitherby endorsement of two or more items on the CAGE alco-hol screening questionnaire ( Ewing, 1984; Mayeld et al., 1974;Samet et al., in press ), or by clinical judgment of one of two physician study investigators. The exclusion criteriawere:(1)inabilitytounderstandspokenEnglishorSpanish;(2) evidence of impaired cognitive function as determinedb yal o w( <21) score on the Mini Mental State Examina- tion (Folstein et al., 1975 ); or (3) plans to leave the Boston area during the next 2 years. Patients who were not in careat BMC or BIDMC were asked to document their HIV di-agnosis by providing either HIV testing documentation ortheir HIV prescription medications. 2.3. Measures 2.3.1. Variables measured at baseline and at each visit (repeated measures) 2.3.1.1. Dependent variable. Consistency of condom use was assessed using the item from the risk assessment bat-tery (RAB) \"In the past 6 months, how often did youuse condoms when you had sex?\" ( Navaline et al., 1994 ). Inconsistent condom use was dened as less than 100%V. Ehrenstein et al./Drug and Alcohol Dependence 73 (2004) 159-166 161 reported use in the last 6 months before each visit. Those reporting either 100% condom use or sexual abstinenceformed the comparison group. 2.3.1.2. Mainindependentvariable. Alcoholconsumption inthe30daysbeforeeachassessmentwasusedasameasureof the usual pattern of use. It was calculated using alcoholquantity and frequency questions, and the Addiction Sever-ity Index (ASI) ( Leonhard et al., 2000 ). We classied alco- holuseas'abstinent','moderate'and'at-risk',basedontheNational Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism rec-ommendations, which dene moderate drinking as no morethan 14 drinks per week for men, and no more than sevendrinks per week for women ( National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 1995 ). Since we did not measure daily or weekly alcohol use in this study, we computed av-erage weekly consumption from the data on the 30-day re-ported frequency of use and typical daily amount. Based onthese calculations, we assigned the alcohol use categories. 2.3.1.3. Other independent variables. The following HIV risk behavior questions covering the last 6 months beforeeach visit, asked as a part of the RAB, were included in theanalysis:dichotomousvariablesforinjectiondruguse;num-ber of sexual partners (one or fewer versus two or more);selling sex for money or drugs; buying sex for money ordrugs; and an opinion regarding condoms being 'a hassle touse'.Useofheroinorcocaineinthelast30daysbeforeeachvisit was assessed by the ASI and each used as a dichoto-mous variable. In order to account for participants' physicaland mental health, we included CD4 cell count ( 350//H9262l versus >350/ /H9262l), receiving ART, and depressive symptoms measuredwiththeCenterofEpidemiologicStudiesDepres-sion (CES-D) scale with scores potentially ranging from 0to 60 (Radloff, 1977 ). To address the possibility that incon- sistent condom use patterns may change over time spent inthe study, an indicator variable for each timepoint was alsoincluded in the analysis. 2.3.2. Variablesmeasuredonlyatbaseline(pointmeasures) We following variables: age gender; race/ethnicity (black, white, Latino,other); high school completion; having lived with a partnermost of the time in previous 6 months; sexual orientation(heterosexual,gay/lesbian,bisexual);homelessness(denedas spending at least one night in a shelter or on the street inthe previous 6 months); and recency of HIV diagnosis ( 12 months versus >12 months before the baseline interview). 2.4. Statistical analysis Weexcludedfromallanalysesfoursubjectswhoreported sexual abstinence at each visit, since they were not at riskforinconsistentcondomuseduringthefollow-up.Intheun-adjustedanalyses,weusedFisher'sexacttest,orChi-squaretest for trend for categorical variables, and t-test or anal-ysis of variance for continuous variables. In the adjusted analysis, we modeled inconsistent condom use at each visitas a function of baseline variables (e.g., gender and educa-tion) and variables measured at that visit (e.g., current sub-stance use). Depending on the number of completed vis-its, each subject contributed from 1 to 7 observations tothe analysis. We estimated regression parameters and mod-eled within-subject correlation using generalized estimatingequation(GEE)logisticregressionmodels( LiangandZeger, 1986). These models account for same-subject association by estimating the within-subject outcome odds ratios (OR)for each pair of timepoints. Main-effect independent vari-ables in the analysis were included based on earlier ndingsor clinical importance. In addition, we examined pairwiseinteractions between alcohol consumption and the follow-ing covariates: race/ethnicity; gender; partners; injection drug use; heroin use; cocaine for money and/or drugs; selling sex for moneyand/or drugs; and ART use. We included interaction termswith the inclusion signicance criterion set at 0.05. 2.5. Follow-up visits In order to assess the degree of association between the study variables and the amount of follow-up visits wemodeled the number of completed visits as a linear func-tion of study variables. Since the interviewing ended ata pre-determined date with late-entering subjects havingfewer or no follow-up opportunities, we hypothesized thatrecruitment date would be the most important predictorof the number of visits. We used indicator variables for6-month periods of recruitment. Also included in the modelexamining number of completed visits were age, gender,race/ethnicity, recency of HIV diagnosis, sexual orientation,along with baseline values of ART use, injection drug use,inconsistent condom use, and level of alcohol consumption.We used SAS software ( SAS/STAT Software: Changes and Enhancements, Release 8.1, 2000 ) to perform the analyses. 3.

Among the 345 subjects, there were a total of 996 inter- viewsoverthe4-yearstudyperiod. Table3showstheresults of the multivariate analysis. We detected statistically sig-nicant interaction of alcohol consumption with concurrent(within the same 6-month period) injection drug use ( 2= 17.1, d.f.=2,P=0.0002). Injection drug use among subjects not reporting alcohol consumption at a given visitwas associated with an adjusted odds ratio (95% condenceinterval (CI)) of 1.7 (0.9, 3.1); and at-risk drinking amongnon-injectors, with an adjusted OR (95% CI) of 0.7 (0.4,1.3).However,comparedwiththosewhoneitherdrankalco-hol nor injected drugs, at-risk drinkers with concurrent drug injection had an adjusted OR (95% CI) of 4.3 (1.5, 12.2)for inconsistent condom use. These results indicate that thecombined effect of at-risk drinking and injection drug useon inconsistent condom use was greater than would be ex-pectedundertheassumptionofmultiplicationoftheeffects. Among those with active injection drug use, the adjusted OR (95% CI) was 2.6 (0.9, 7.3) for at-risk drinkers and0.7 (0.3, 1.6) for moderate drinkers, each compared withabstainers. Among those without active injection drug use,the adjusted OR (95% CI) was 0.7 (0.4, 1.3) for at-riskdrinkers and 1.5 (0.9, 2.3) for moderate drinkers. Other characteristics signicantly associated with incon- sistent condom use in the adjusted analysis included livingwithapartner,adjustedOR(95%CI)3.59(2.2,5.7);having2 partners, 2.7 (1.8, 4.0); being gay or lesbian, 2.4 (1.4, 4.1); believing that condom use was 'a hassle', 2.5 (1.8,3.4); and female gender, 2.0 (1.2, 3.4). In addition, border-line signicant increase in odds was observed among thoseselling sex for drugs and/or money, adjusted OR (95% CI),1.8 (1.0, 3.5); those who had a positive HIV test within 12months of the baseline interview, 1.6 (1.0, 2.7); and thosewith CD4 cell counts of ciable association of race/ethnicity, ART use, or depressivesymptomswithinconsistentcondomusewasseeninthead-justed analysis. 3.2. Assessment of differential follow-up The median number of completed visits was 3. Alcohol use was borderline signicant in predicting the number ofvisits ( P=0.06), with those who used alcohol at base- line completing more visits on average than non-users. Ashypothesized, time of recruitment into the study was themost important predictor of the number of completed visits(P<0.0001) with subjects entering at the beginning of the recruitment completing, on average, three interviews morethan subjects entering at the end of the recruitment. In themodel examining the number of visits, all predictors com-bined explained 37% of the variation. In the main multi-variable analysis, time of recruitment was not a signicantpredictor of inconsistent condom use ( P=0.7), nor did it materially change the OR estimates for the alcohol use vari-able, so it was not included in the nal model. 4. Discussion In examining the association between alcohol consump- tionandinconsistentcondomuseinacohortofHIV-infectedpatients with past or current alcohol problems, we foundthat at-risk drinking was associated with inconsistent con-dom use among active injection drug users. These ndingsexpand on our understanding of how alcohol use influencesHIV risk behaviors in high-risk populations. We demon-strate that at-risk alcohol consumption remains associated164 V. Ehrenstein et al./Drug and Alcohol Dependence 73 (2004) 159-166 with unsafe sex risk behavior among injection drug users after they learn about their HIV infection. The result that at-risk drinking was not associated with inconsistent condom use in the absence of active injectiondrug use was not consistent with our original hypothesis.This nding does suggest that the link between alcohol useand risky sexual behavior is not universal; rather particulargroups seem to be at higher risk. The joint effect of druguse and alcohol has been noted by other researchers. Steinet al. found that at-risk alcohol use was associated withneedle-sharing behavior among active injection drug users(Stein et al., 2000 ), while Rees et al. linked at-risk alcohol consumption with sex risk behaviors among women with ahistory of heroin or cocaine dependence ( Rees et al., 2001 ). Thus, drug use and at-risk drinking seem to magnify eachother's detrimental effects on safe HIV-related behavior, aswas also observed in our study. Wefoundamoderatelystrongassociationbetweenincon- sistent condom use and living with a partner. Regular part-ners of HIV patients are at the highest risk of HIV, includ-ing resistant strains ( Little et al., 2002 ), as the probability of HIV transmission rises proportionately to the number ofsexual encounters. Inconsistent condom use with cohabitat-ing partners may be perceived as less risky than that withoccasional partners, but such behavior among HIV-infectedpersonsstillholdsgreatriskforbothpartners.Thisispartic-ularly concerning, given that selling sex for money or drugswas associated with inconsistent condom use in our study,and some subjects who reported sex trading also reportedliving with a partner. Such behavior patterns may in part ac-count for the 2.6-fold increase in transmission of multidrugresistant strains of HIV in the US between 1995 and 2000(Little et al., 2002 ). We found that participants with gay or lesbian sexual ori- entation were less likely than heterosexual individuals touse condoms. Despite reports suggesting that in some ar-eas of the United States men who have sex with men haveadopted and sustained safer sexual practices ( Donovan and Ross, 2000 ), a European study documents rising incidence of gonorrhea among men who have sex with men and aneight-fold increase in the odds of HIV seroconversion com-pared with heterosexual men ( Donovan et al., 2000 ). Such reports are consistent with our ndings, suggesting that thefavorable behavior changes among this group need bolster-ing. Additionally, we found that women were less likelythan men to use condoms in heterosexual intercourse; thismayreflectsomewomen'sinabilitytonegotiatecondomuse(Kral et al., 2001 ). Both high CD4 cell count and recent HIV diagnosis were associated with increased risk of inconsistent condom usein our HIV-infected cohort. Individuals with higher CD4cell counts are often asymptomatic and have fewer medicalproblems. Recent HIV diagnosis may represent a differentissueasrecentHIVdiagnosisisnotroutinelyassociatedwithhighCD4cellcounts( Sametetal.,2001 ).Wespeculatethat these ndings indicate that HIV-infected individuals needtime to realize the implications of HIV infection for sexual behavior, particularly if their symptoms are mild or absent. Contrary to the ndings by Buchacz et al. (2001) ,w e found higher, not lower, educational level to be associatedwith inconsistent condom use, and observed no striking dif-ferences with respect to inconsistent condom use amongethnic groups. These different ndings may be due to thedifferent character of our HIV-infected cohort, consistingof individuals with a history of alcohol problems, predom-inantly unmarried, recruited largely from an urban North-eastern USA setting. In contrast, Buchacz et al. studiedHIV-serodiscordant couples in California. Thisstudyhasseverallimitations.Wereliedonself-report in measuring most of the study variables. Sexual risk be-haviors are subject to social desirability bias and may beunder-reported. Among HIV-infected individuals, inconsis-tent condom use carries additional risk of infecting anotherindividual. We dichotomized the inconsistent condom usevariable for the analysis in order to reduce potential mixingoftrueconsistentuserswiththosewhomayreportgenerallyconsistentusebutinrealitydonotusecondoms100%ofthetime. We acknowledge that this analytic approach will lumptogetherdifferentpatternsofinconsistentcondomuse,how-ever, this threshold seemed most consistent with the HIVprevention goal to eliminate HIV transmission risk. Thereis, however, no reason to suspect that this behavior wouldbe differentially reported in different groups of participants.Weattemptedtominimizeanybiasbymakingtheinterviewprocess condential and private. We also note that subjectsdid report a substantial amount of non-socially desirablebehavior. Additionally, subjects were followed for variablelengths of time, with some of them not completing all inter-views. We addressed this possibility by examining predic-tors of the total number of visits. As hypothesized, time ofrecruitment into the study was the most important predictorof the number of completed visits, and it was found not tobe a confounder in our analysis. Finally,datafromeachvisitwereanalyzedcross-sectiona- lly, allowing for inferences about association, rather thancausation. Evidence suggests, however, that alcohol use af-fects sexual practices immediately at a given sexual en-counter rather than over the long-term ( Seage et al., 1998 ). We thus deliberately chose the cross-sectional over the lon-gitudinal approach, in order to capture the use of alcoholmost proximal in time to measured condom use. Nonethe-less, the measurement of alcohol use associated with eachsexual act, which would be ideal, was not obtained in thisstudy. The relation between alcohol consumption and inconsis- tentcondomuseamongHIV-infectedpersonswithahistoryofalcoholproblemsiscomplicated.First,alcoholconsump-tion at high, rather than moderate, level is associated withinconsistent condom use. Second, this association is man-ifest predominantly in injection drug users. This suggeststhat efforts to reduce alcohol use in HIV-infected personswho inject drugs may also result in progress towards theV. Ehrenstein et al./Drug and Alcohol Dependence 73 (2004) 159-166 165 goal of decreasing the frequency of HIV sexual risk-taking. These ndings bolster the argument for routine assessmentofalcoholuseinHIV-infectedpatients,particularlyinthosewith a history of injection drug use.

INTRODUCTION The use of communication and information technology in health care delivery has had a signicant impact on the dynamics of the relationship between health careproviders and patients. (1)Nowadays, patients and consumers can receive a plethora of health information and advice through various sources from the Internet to theirtelephones. (2,3)Some of these systems monitor the health status of patients and no- tify their heath care providers about important changes in status.(4)These systems have the potential of improving health outcomes, reducing health care costs, andreducing the burden of disease management for patients, caregivers and health careproviders, particularly for patients with chronic health conditions. (5-7)The range of services these systems offer run the gamut of simple information to complex moni-toring and decision support.

This means that not only the technology should be user-friendly, but also the program design should be tailored to particular needs of patientsand thus perceived as helpful and acceptable by them. Therefore, these systemsneed to be evaluated for usability, helpfulness, and satisfaction from the patients'perspective, as well as their effectiveness in promoting health and controlling disease.Evaluation, as a critical step in the development process of these systems, will requirean understanding of the patient-users' opinions and perceptions, preferences, likesand dislikes, etc. These objectives, however, are not easily fullled through controlled, formal- ized, or structured evaluation methodologies. For example, certain types of usabilityevaluation methods such as cognitive walkthroughs (9-11)or heuristic analysis(12-14) that are typically performed by the developers or expert evaluators without the user'sparticipation are not exactly suitable for evaluating systems that provide health ser-vices to users. Or, more traditional research methodologies (15,16)such as structured questionnaires, even though useful, provide only limited information on usabilityand acceptability. (17)For such systems, users' active participation and involvement in the evaluation process is a critical factor. Such participation may involve a sampleof potential users preferably from the beginning of the system's design process (18)or after a system is built with system improvement as the basic objective.(13)Methods for such evaluations may include using workshops and focus groups(19)as well as ethnographic and contextual inquiry.(20-22) Ethnography, a method that requires participant observation and immersion in the life-world of study participants(23)is perhaps the most effective method for exploring or evaluating human-computer interaction.(24)However, an ethnographic evaluation is costly, long, and labor intensive as it requires a lengthy period of partic-ipant observation and exploration of the subjects' every day lives. Because of theseconstraints, ethnographic methodologies are not frequently used in the evaluationof health information systems. An appropriate alternative, however, is a qualitativemethodology that relies on participant observation and in-depth interviews of shorterdurations. Thus, instead of conducting a retrospective, single-study in-depth interviewto evaluate a system after its use, observation and in-depth interviews may be con-ducted as users use a system. (17)We utilized such a methodology in two separate pilot studies to evaluate two different interactive patient care-management systems. Be-low, we will describe how observation, sufcient training, and semistructured in-depthinterviews helped to effectively explore patients' opinions and views on two differenttypes of automated interactive systems: TLC-DietAid (Telephone-Linked Care forDiet Adherence in Dyslipidemia) (8,pp:95-101)and System (Home Asthma Telemonitoring System).(25)TLC-DietAid is a totally telephone-based con- versation system that educates, advises, and counsels patients with dyslipidemia tomodify their dietary behaviors. The HAT system, on the other hand, is based on hand-held computing devices in the home linked to a Web-based monitoring and reportingsystem. The HAT system promotes home-based asthma self-care management. It was anticipated that the data derived from observation and in-depth interviews conducted with patient-users would enable the investigators to identify major prob-lems experienced by the patients while using these systems in their homes. TheseP1: IAZ Journal of Medical Systems [joms] pp1026-joms-475069 March 30, 2004 15:21 Style le version June 5th, 2002 Testing the Usability of Two Automated Home-Based Patient-Management Systems 145 methods would help them implement changes in the systems to make them more usable, helpful, and acceptable to patient-users. TLC-DietAid System TLC-DietAid is a computer-based telecommunications system that uses com- puter telephony to carry out totally automated telephone conversations with patient-users. (6)TLC-DietAid monitors dietary behavior of dyslipidemia (cholesterolemia) patients in their homes and provides them with nutrition information, advice, andbehavioral counseling, principally to lower saturated fat in their diets and thus lowerlow-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in their sera. (8)LDL-C is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease, the most signicant cause of death in the UnitedStates and other industrialized nations. During weekly conversations, TLC-DietAid speaks to patients over the tele- phone using computer-controlled digitized human speech. The patients, in turn,communicate with TLC-DietAid using the touch-tone keypad of their telephones. Inusual practice, patients call TLC-DietAid once a week, however, for this evaluationstudy they used it every day for 2 weeks. Conversations typically last between 5 and10 min, depending on the number or complexity of the topics addressed and theuser's responses. After each conversation, TLC stores the information recorded bypatients in a database, for use in tailoring future conversations. Using the National Cholesterol Education Project (NCEP) Step I guidelines as its basis, (26)TLC-DietAid conversations were designed to modify the users' intake of certain foods: (1) to lower the consumption of whole fat dairy foods and redand processed meat, (2) to increase the consumption of fruits and vegetables, and(3) to increase the consumption of whole grains. For individual users, TLC-DietAidtargeted those food groups the person consumed in \"unhealthy\" amounts, eitherbecause they consumed too few fruits and/or vegetables, too much whole fat dairyfoods and/or red/processed meat, or too little whole grain dairy foods. The systembroadly targeted important nutrients in the diet, such as saturated fat and ber, bothby targeting the relevant food groups (e.g., whole fat dairy and red/processed meatsfor their saturated fat content), but also by encouraging related dietary behaviorssuch as trimming fat off meat, avoiding fried foods, etc. To achieve these goals, the design of TLC-DietAid emulated the clinical strate- gies used by expert clinicians and the principles of a theoretical model of healthbehavior change: Social Cognitive Theory (SCT). SCT synthesizes concepts andprocesses from cognitive, behavioral, and emotional models of behavioral change,and postulates that behavior change is determined by the reciprocal determinednature of person, behavior, and environment. Within this encompassing theory,there are many constructs, four of which are especially relevant to the design ofTLC-DietAid, namely behavioral capability, self-efcacy, outcome expectation, andreinforcement. (27) The Home Asthma Telemonitoring System The Home Asthma Telemonitoring (HAT) system was designed to address prob- lems in asthma self-care management using a combination of mobile computing andP1: IAZ Journal of Medical Systems [joms] pp1026-joms-475069 March 30, 2004 15:21 Style le version June 5th, 2002 146 Farzanfar, Finkelstein, and Friedman Internet technologies(25)HAT fully implements the guidelines of National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP)(28)and uses state-of-the-art knowl- edge about the educational, behavioral, cognitive, and organizational componentsof asthma self-management. (29)The HAT system aims to provide patients with con- tinuous individualized help in the daily routine of asthma self-care, coupled withmonitoring of their disease status and ongoing communication with their health careproviders. It is designed to detect and provide help to asthma patients who have dif-culties in following their self-care plan and to notify health care providers if certainclinical conditions occur to enable timely intervention. The HAT system consists of a patient unit, a decision support server, and a clinical station. The patient unit includes a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) andan electronic spirometer. Patients enter answers to asthma clinical status questionson the PDA and perform lung function testing using the spirometer on a regularbasis. The spirometer transmits the test results via a serial interface to the PDA. Thepatient can also use the PDA to transmit a personal message to medical personnel inaddition to transmitting their answers to the clinical status questions. Immediatelyafter the completion of the self-testing, all data are sent by the PDA to a remoteclinical information server which stores the data in a database which is accessibleby the patient's asthma provider at a predesignated secure Internet site. The datacan be sent over a standard telephone line or over a wireless network. Patient datafor the last 4 months are also stored in the PDA and are available for the patient'sreview. During each self-testing session, the patient receives feedback messages gen-erated automatically, or sent by medical personnel, via the same system. The HATdecision support server constantly monitors patient self-testing data and alerts thestaff if the data indicate that the patient is not self-testing properly. The system alsoalerts clinicians if any clinically negative trend in the patient's condition occurs indi-cated by the spirometer or clinical data. This helps clinicians intervene earlier in theprocess of clinical deterioration than they might otherwise, and may prevent asthmaexacerbation, emergency department visits, and emergency hospitalization. Study Population The study was conducted with the patient-users of the two automated home- based health care systems. Patients for the TLC-DietAid evaluation were under treat-ment for dyslipidemia at two university hospital primary care clinics and two primarycare practices in the community. Patients for the HAT evaluation were being treatedat an asthma clinic at a university hospital. The eligibility criteria included (1) age20 and older; (2) physician diagnosis of dyslipidemia or asthma; (3) understandingof spoken English. The names and telephone numbers of patients were provided tothe investigators by their clinicians. The Institutional Review Board approved bothevaluation studies and all patients signed an informed consent document. Direct Observation and In-Depth Interviews To perform the evaluation studies, we used direct observation and semistruc- tured, in-depth interviews of selected patient-users. We evaluated a total ofP1: IAZ Journal of Medical Systems [joms] pp1026-joms-475069 March 30, 2004 15:21 Style le version June 5th, 2002 Testing the Usability of Two Automated Home-Based Patient-Management Systems 147 13 patients (8 for DietAid and 5 for HAT). We enrolled study subjects for the eval- uation of each system until nothing substantially new was being discovered frominterviews of the most recent cases. This procedure for setting the sample sizefor qualitative research studies follows the principles of \"information/theoreticalsaturation.\" (30,31)Subsequently, the patients used their assigned system at home for 2 weeks at the end of which another in-depth interview was conducted over thetelephone. For each subject evaluated, we rst demonstrated how the system worked, trained the subject to use it, observed the person using it, and corrected any mis-takes. The in-depth interviews occurred at the end of the session. Because of basicdifferences in the user interface and content of the two systems, we selected dif-ferent settings to conduct the training, observation, and the initial interview. ForTLC-DietAid, these were done at the study's research ofces; for the HAT system,they were conducted in participants' homes. The training for TLC-DietAid took 10-15 min, and utilized an automated TLC instruction conversation called TLC Training Module. This TLC module explainshow TLC works and how the user should interact with the system, and is customizedfor training individuals to use a particular TLC system. The TLC-DietAid TrainingModule thus used content from TLC-DietAid in the training. During the training,we used a speakerphone to listen to the interaction between TLC-DietAid and thepatient. We were, therefore, able to respond when problems arose that could not behandled by the TLC-DietAid Training Module. For the HAT system, training took 30-40 min. Patients were instructed on how to operate the PDA and on how to perform a spirometry test in their homes. Following the training, we gave the subjects a \"Users' Guide.\" The Guide con- tained information on how to use the system, answers to common questions, andexplanations on how to solve problems. Participants were given a toll-free telephonenumber (Helpline) that they could call if they experienced any difculty using thesystem. Once the demonstration was completed and all questions answered, participants used the system on their own while an investigator observed them. The investiga-tor noted the time the participants spent in performing each of the tasks requiredof system use, as well as instances of hesitation, indecision, or specic problemsencountered. Participants were given ample opportunity to express their opinionsabout the system and were able to end the interview when they wished. None of theparticipants, however, ended the session prematurely. Once the initial interview was completed, participants were asked to use the system at home every day for 2 weeks. Patients were told that they would have anin-depth follow-up telephone interview at the end of the 2-week period. The durationof the follow-up interview was between 15 and 45 min depending upon how muchthe participants wished to communicate. During interviews, we followed an \"interview guide approach\" in which a set of issues to be explored during the interviews with study participants are dened inadvance in an interview guide. The interview guide served as a question checklist forthe interviewer to make sure that all relevant topics are covered. Using establishedprocedures of qualitative interviewing (30,31)immediately after each conversation theP1: IAZ Journal of Medical Systems [joms] pp1026-joms-475069 March 30, 2004 15:21 Style le version June 5th, 2002 148 Farzanfar, Finkelstein, and Friedman collected data were analyzed and the results were used to generate interview ques- tions for the next study subject. Thus, the interview protocol evolved during thecourse of the interviews. This method was also used during the follow-up telephoneinterviews. The last step in the evaluation process was the reexamination and integra-tion of all the users' responses into a comprehensive set of observations, conclusions,and recommendations for modifying each system on the basis of the evaluation. RESULTS The analysis of the in-depth interviews uncovered two major categories of pa- tient concerns: (a) medium-specic issues, i.e., those that dealt with the participants'reactions to the structural aspects of each system's interface with the user such asease of use, understanding of instructions, etc., and (b) content-specic issues, i.e.,those that dealt with the participants' reactions to the messages delivered by thesystems. For both systems, medium-specic issues were detected mostly during theinitial training, observation, and interview session. Most content-specic issues, how-ever, were brought up during the follow-up telephone interviews. It seems that the2-week period of time devoted to the utilization of both systems by the participantsprovided them with ample time to reflect on the specic features of the systems. Medium-Specic Issues for TLC-DietAid We found out that the majority of the TLC-DietAid participants experienced the same problems in using the system which supported a conclusion that there wereinherent problems with the design and operation of the system, and not idiosyncraticissues for particular users. These problems were of two different types: (1) issuesrelated to users' cognitive capabilities, and (2) issues related to the system's design.The rst type of issue became apparent when all participants except one had problemsfollowing a number of the instructions for using TLC-DietAid. Even though boththe TLC Training Module and the Users' Guide provided instructions to patients onhow to use the system, many patients either misinterpreted the instructions or foundit difcult to remember them. For example, in response to TLC-DietAid's questions,users were asked to press the number \"1\" key on their phone to signify \"yes\" and thenumber \"2\" key to signify \"no.\" This worked well as throughout the conversation thetwo keys (1 and 2) were designed to be used to express the same answer to a questionand thus were easily remembered. However, in a few sections of the conversation, thesystem instructed the participants to press other numbers such as \"0\" and \"99,\" thusadding a few more options to the multiple choice responses. Subsequently, duringour observations, we realized that the majority of the participants had difcultyremembering the key that signied a particular option. As a result, we modiedTLC-DietAid so that the system repeated the options a few times particularly in thebeginning of the conversation when these concepts had been newly introduced. Wealso realized that we needed to emphasize the system's \"Help\" functions. We identied a similar problem that affected the patients' ability to use TLC- DietAid in a section of the intervention that quizzed them about their knowledge ofP1: IAZ Journal of Medical Systems [joms] pp1026-joms-475069 March 30, 2004 15:21 Style le version June 5th, 2002 Testing the Usability of Two Automated Home-Based Patient-Management Systems 149 nutrition principles. In this section, TLC-DietAid asked them to enter their responses to the questions as either \"true\" or \"false,\" but failed to explain that \"1\" stood for\"true\" and \"2\" stood for \"false\" as this was assumed by the system's designers. Allparticipants except one hesitated to enter a response to these questions as they wereunsure how to proceed. As a result, we claried the instructions given to users in thatsection of the TLD-DietAid. We also learned that the system neglected to point out some helpful features to the participants. TLC-DietAid contained two features intended to help users respondto questions. They were (1) repetition of a question if a user failed to enter a responseafter 5 s, (2) pressing the pound key (#) if the user wished to return to the previousquestion after the person had entered an answer (to possibly change the answer).These two features were described in the Users' Guide and were reviewed by theTraining Module at the time of their training. However, TLC-DietAid itself did notremind the users of these features. These and other issues were identied and discussed mostly during the initial training, observation, and interview session. During this session, one of the partici-pants discovered a software error in the system, something that the extensive softwaretesting had failed to uncover. Medium-Specic Issues for the HAT System Medium-specic issues were brought to our attention during both the initial and follow-up interviews. One of the most important of these was the length of thetraining session. We learned that each individual participant required a differentapproach during this session. While younger participants could very well toleratea 1-h session, the older participants stated that the duration was too long and thustiresome. They felt that two shorter visits would have been less burdensome for them.Other individuals, particularly those who had never worked with computers, neededand wanted more assistance during the training session on how to use the system. Forexample, one patient needed help to learn how to push the buttons on the PDA andanother wanted more assistance with using the \"Enter\" key. As a result, we realizedthat the Users' Guide was too brief, and that we needed to provide a more detaileddescription on how to use the HAT System in it. We also created an on-line \"Help\"for the HAT patients that described how the system should be used and how to carryout the spirometry testing. The on-line \"Help\" also contained responses to commonquestions. In contrast to our evaluation of TLC-DietAid, we did not uncover anyHAT system user interface design problems. Content-Specic Issues for TLC-DietAid The participants showed different reactions to the system's dietary behavior change content on the basis of individual preferences. Overall, most participantsreacted very positively to the system. During the training and rst interview session,most indicated that they \"learned a lot.\" Similarly, during the follow-up interview,after all participants had used the system at home on a daily basis for 2 weeks, allsaid that the information TLC-DietAid provided was useful to them and that theyP1: IAZ Journal of Medical Systems [joms] pp1026-joms-475069 March 30, 2004 15:21 Style le version June 5th, 2002 150 Farzanfar, Finkelstein, and Friedman were thinking of changing some of their dietary habits on the basis of the system's assessment of their diet and the advice it gave them on how to change their habits. Infact, one woman said that she had begun eating more \"sh.\" In some cases, however,the users suggested that we should add to our list of food items, for example adding\"grape nuts\" to the list of cereals. Another useful suggestion was to add \"healthyoptions\" to choose from in the section on \"Eating in the Fast-Food Restaurants\"such as choosing BK Broiler (sauce taken out!) at Burger King. On the basis of thereactions of the participants, we added \"stir fry\" and \"grill\" options to the section oncooking methods. Other participants expressed concerns that advice offered to them by the system was inappropriate for them. For example, one participant objected to having orangejuice or grapefruit juice among recommended fruit juices since the \"acidity\" in thesejuices caused the person heartburn. Another participant suggested that TLC-DietAidshould not recommend the consumption of fruits and vegetables that were out ofseason and thus difcult to nd or costly. One user made an observation about the\"dining-out\" section in which participants are encouraged to choose healthier menuitems at restaurants. He pointed out: \"most people go out to eat it all\" and thereforehe did not like the recommendation that suggested modication of his food selection.Another individual indicated that we should not include sh among our food itemsfor him since he did not eat sh at all. Such patient-specic comments led us to modifysome parts of the system to better address individual preferences and opinions. Content-Specic Issues for the HAT System The participants' critiques of the content of the HAT System were also varied and particular to the specic user as they were for TLC-DietAid. The overall responsewas extremely positive. All participants indicated that having the system at homemade them more aware of their asthma and helped them remember to take theirmedications on time. One participant said that since she began using the system, thefrequency of her asthma attacks declined markedly. A number of issues, however,were raised in relation to the content of the system. Some pointed out that we shoulduse lay terms when asking the asthma status questions on the PDA since it was difcultfor them to understand a number of jargons we had used. For example, some of thepatients did not understand the words \"bronchodialator\" and \"pulmonology\" whichprompted us to modify the language to \"quick relief inhaler\" and \"lung disease.\"One person asked us the meaning of the sentence \"the data is now complete.\" Other\"interface\" issues were identied by some participants. One patient pointed outthat our introductory logo on the PDA screen was too large and wordy and thusdistracting. This was subsequently modied. Overall, HAT users had fewer problemsthan did TLD-DietAid users. DISCUSSION This study explored the value of direct observation of users and semistructured in-depth interviews in the usability testing of two automated interactive home-basedP1: IAZ Journal of Medical Systems [joms] pp1026-joms-475069 March 30, 2004 15:21 Style le version June 5th, 2002 Testing the Usability of Two Automated Home-Based Patient-Management Systems 151 systems for disease management in patients with hypercholesterolemia and asthma: TLC-DietAid and HAT. These two systems have similar functional goals to moni-tor and improve the self-care of patients, but differ in terms of content, computertechnology, and user interface. Our previous experience in using formalized structured questionnaires for evaluation (25,32)had shown that while structured questionnaires are effective in as- sessing patient attitudes towards predened issues, they lacked the ability to identifyremediable system deciencies and they did not address patient-specic concerns.Our methodology reflected the fact that the evaluation of medical information sys-tems particularly those utilized by patients cannot be separated from the contextof use. As social systems, these systems should be evaluated with a focus on theinteraction between the technology and contextual aspects of utilization. (33,34) Scholarly debate on the appropriate methodology for the evaluation of medical information systems has been underway for more than two decades.(35,36)However, qualitative approaches for evaluation of these systems have gained more recog-nition only during the past 10 years. (20,34)Among various qualitative approaches to evaluation, ethnography is considered to be the most appropriate by some ISscholars. (21,23,37)However, an ethnographic evaluation of medical information sys- tem, though ideally a valuable methodology, is generally neither practical nor af-fordable as it may be too intrusive in the user's life and expensive in terms of theresearcher's time. We adopted an alternative approach, i.e., participant observationand two interviews which offered the advantages of ethnography, i.e., it allowed ex-ploration of the users' experience over time (we observed the users and conductedtwo in-depth interviews), without its constraints (cost, intrusiveness). It also facili-tated the observation of temporally changing behavioral phenomena such as changeof food-purchasing habits and adherence to asthma medication regimen. The results of these two pilot studies demonstrate that observation and semistructured in-depth interviews are valuable tools in determining the usabilityand acceptability with automated interactive systems in health care. (38)These meth- ods are useful in identifying specic, remediable problems that interfere with theease of use, acceptability and perceived utility of these systems as well as the errorsand correctable deciencies in both systems. On the basis of our results, it would bereasonable to conclude that all automated systems like the ones evaluated in ourstudies should be pretested before they are released for general use and before they are evaluated in expensive randomized clinical trials. Furthermore, for the two pilot projects under study here, their utility went be- yond generating usability data. We learned that patients do not receive health infor-mation in a neutral manner. Indeed, in both pilot studies, patients tended to assessand interpret the information provided to them in a way that best t their lives andtheir particular situations. We also observed suggestive evidence that use of the twosystems, for as brief a period as 2 weeks, had positive effects on the health behavior ofsome of the users. As described above, one HAT patient, who liked the HAT system'scues promoting medication adherence, said that by remembering to take her medi-cations she was gaining better control over her asthma. This patient also said that theHAT system had provided her with a new awareness about her condition. Similarly,a patient who participated in the DietAid evaluation pilot study indicated that afterP1: IAZ Journal of Medical Systems [joms] pp1026-joms-475069 March 30, 2004 15:21 Style le version June 5th, 2002 152 Farzanfar, Finkelstein, and Friedman being on the system for 2 weeks, she was more mindful of healthy choices when she went food shopping and that she was eating more \"sh\" as TLC had suggested.These and other indicators of likely intervention effect supported our decision forboth HAT and TLC-DietAid, to evaluate their efcacy in randomized clinical trials.

To explore this phenomenon, we administered four open\u00ad ended questions after participants were screened for problem drinking by both an automated and a human telephone inter\u00ad viewer. Both interviews administered AUDIT(,flcohol Use /2is\u00ad orders Identification lest) for assessing problem drinking. Individuals were recruited into the study who responded to ads in daily papers. Sixty-two percent ofthe participants preferred the human interviewer and only 3% among these expressed a concern about confidentiality ofthe interview. Among the 22% whopreferred the automated interview, 32% indicated confiden\u00ad tiality as a reason for their preference. Keywords: Automated alcohol screening, Human-Computer Interaction, Technology assessment. Introduction The utilization of computers to interview patients for symptoms assessment, screening, education, counseling, etc., is becoming more common in medical practice[ 1,2]. One use ofcomputers is to help patients (and their health care providers) determine whether they are involved in risky health behavior [3,4]. Various methods of assessing risky health behavior including computer\u00ad based interviewing have been proposed and evaluated [5]. In fact, some evaluations of computer-based interviewing versus professional interviewers and other methods of data col1ection for assessment of risky health behavior have demonstrated that this method is effective and may even elicit more truthful re\u00ad sponses from participants [6,7,8]. This paper presents the results of analysis of open-ended additional questions administered to individuals who were interviewed separately by a telephone\u00ad based human interviewer and a telephone-based computer-con\u00ad trolled automated interview on the subject of problem drinking (people who drink above recommended guidelines or who have alcohol-related problems that do not meet criteria for a diagnosis ofalcohol abuse or dependence). In both types ofinterviews, the AUDIT, a validated screening test for problem drinking was ad\u00ad ministered. The two interviews were identical in all respects. The open-ended questions were asked by a trained human inter\u00ad viewer via the telephone at the end of the second AUDIT inter\u00adview. The open-ended additional questions evaluated the participants' overall opinions about the two interviews, their as\u00ad sessment of both methods of interviewing, their preference for one or another method and why, and the truthfulness oftheir re\u00ad porting of problem drinking behavior. Ielephone-,Linked C.are (TLC) is an interactive voice response (IVR) and speech recognition (SR) system that is usually uti\u00ad lized for disease prevention and health promotion and for chron\u00ad ic disease management [9-13]. While most TLC applications are designed to function as a health care intervention, TLC-AUDIT uses a standardized, valid and reliable instrument to screen users for problem drinking [14]. The AUDIT is a 10-item screening tool developed and used by World Health Organization [IS] in multinational trials of brief alcohol interventions. The AUDIT produces a total score from 0-40 and has been shown to be gen\u00ad eralizable across cultural characteristics [16]. A score of 8 or more indicates problem drinking. In our study, al1 participants who scored higher than 8 on either the TLC computer or human AUDIT interview were provided with information and advice and were referred to a hotline telephone number for information about problem drinking and its treatment. This information was provided by both the automated interview and the live interview\u00ad er. Methods: Evaluation study design TLC-AUDIT was evaluated for validity in two separate inter\u00ad views (a week apart) by comparing users responses to TLC-AU\u00ad DIT and to a human AUDIT interviewer (N=100). The order of presentation of the two different versions (human or computer) was random. At the end of the second AUDIT interview, we evaluated users' attitudes towards the two interviews by admin\u00ad istering four open-ended questions. The open-ended questions were administered by the live interviewer. The questions ad\u00ad dressed the following topics: 1) participants' thoughts or feel\u00ad ings about the two AUDIT interviews in their own words, 2) the accuracy of the participants' responses, 3) whether the \"right\" questions were asked, 4) participants' preference for the comput\u00ad er or the live interviewer. Participants' responses were transcribed and a subsequent con\u00ad tent analysis of the responses to each question was carried out. The analysis had both quantitative and qualitative dimensions. A systematic coding of the text led to the generation of thematic categories and sub-categories. Continued analysis entailed fre\u00ad 956 R. Farzanfar et al. quent revisions and reconsiderations of categories and sub-cate\u00ad gories. Subsequently, the frequencies of coded concepts were counted [17]. The analysis focused on identifying both recurrent and unique experiences as well as some of the dimensions and context of those experiences. At the same time, each category was compared and contrasted with clusters of other categories in the text [18]. Results Question 1-Overall thoughts or comments Participants were eager to share their thoughts as over 90% did in fact express their opinions about the interviews. Their com\u00ad ments addressed either both interviews or the automated inter\u00ad view: A) Some comments were expressed in general terms and thus directed towards both interviews without explicitly address\u00ad ing one particular interview (live or automated). Twenty five percent of these comments were positive. Some positive com\u00ad ments revealed an interesting dimension that was expressed as a perception ofan increased \"awareness.\" A response such as \"the questions made me think\" was expressed by several people. An\u00ad other dimension was captured in the statements that pointed out the informational value of the interviews. \"Informative\" was thus repeated by several other individuals. Four individuals ex\u00ad pressed negative views about the two interviews. An example is the person who said that the whole interview process was \"too long\" adding \"one needs only an IQ of 60 to answer these ques\u00ad tions!\" There were also responses directed toward both inter\u00ad views that were not explicitly positive but did not have an overtly negative tone either (neutral comments=50%). Within this category a theme emerged that essentially addressed the de\u00ad sign of the structured interview questionnaire and the multiple choice responses provided as answers. Over 10% of the partici\u00ad pants in this category objected to the close ended multiple choice questions. One comment highlights this objection: \"it was diffi\u00ad cult to choose one of the alIowable responses.\" This sentiment, directed either at the structured close-ended questions or the multiple choice answers, was repeated by several respondents: \"some of my answers were incorrect. I didn't mean the [every month] answer,\" \"the choices were not specific enough.\" One notable comment went so far as saying \"response options were better with the interviewer!\" It seems that for this person inter\u00ad action with the live interviewer had a mitigating effect on the perceived complexity and perhaps difficulty of answering the identical close-ended questions administered by TLC-AUDI. B) Comments directed specifically at the automated interview. Ten percent of the participants expressed positive responses towards TLC-AUDIT interview. For example, \"the computer was very good,\" \"the computer was welI programmed ... because you could interrupt it to give answers,\" etc. It is interesting, however, that later during the interview, nearly half of those respondents who had initially expressed positive opinions about the automat\u00ad ed interview added that they preferred to be interviewed by a person. Only two individuals had negative comments about the automated interview. Question 2-Accuracy Almost all participants responded to this question. The category of \"accuracy\" was divided into three sub-categories: I) com\u00ad pletely accurate, 2) mostly accurate, and 3) possible (some) in\u00ad accuracies. All those who used the words \"very,\" \"extremely,\" \"100%,\" to describe the accuracy of their response and/or used the word \"accurate\" without qualification were placed under \"completely accurate\" sub-category (50%). Participants who qualified their description of accuracy with such words as \"pret\u00ad ty\" or \"fairly\" accurate were responses that admitted to some inaccuracies or said that they were \"80%,\" \"85%,\" or \"90%\" accurate (l9%).Those who said that there may be some inaccuracies in their response mostly attributed the reasons to problems with the computer or the limitations in the close-ended, multiple choice questionnaires. One participant mentioned that the computer \"was on autopilot,\" and that \"the timing on the computer made me a little antsy because I felt I didn't have time to think.\" Or, a 65 year old female who had problems with the speech recogni\u00ad tion and thus used the keypad to enter her answers, felt that her responses were \"probably not accurate.\" Question 3-Which, computer or live interviewer, asked the right questions? In response to this question, 57% of the participants replied that the questions were the same in both interviews [the \"correct\" re\u00ad sponse], while 27% said that the live interviewer asked the \"right\" question. Only three persons (3%) said that \"the comput\u00ad er asked the right questions\" or that they \"liked the questions by the computer.\" The rest of the responses were too disparate to generate a conceptual category and were grouped under \"can't say/no response,\" and \"Other\" categories with such examples as \"both did OK.\" Within this group two persons actually said that they \"liked the questions by the computer.\" Furthermore, Twen\u00ad ty-eight percent of the respondents indicated that additional questions should have been asked. The most frequently suggest\u00ad ed question was \"when do you drink?\" By \"when,\" these partic\u00ad ipants meant either: 1) the timing of their drinking, e.g., weekends, or 2) circumstances of their drinking, e.g., when de\u00ad pressed. One person felt that \"both interviews were problematic\" because she did most of her drinking during the weekends. This respondent whose AUDIT scoreswere 18 and 17 respectively, felt that if the pattern of her drinking habit was taken into ac\u00ad count, her scores would have been lower. This sentiment was echoed by 10 other participants. One participant, a 69 year old male, said \"I only drink on weekends when I'm out all day. I never drink during the week and never drink much at home.\" This participant's AUDIT scores were 26 and 22 respectively, and he happened to mention that his doctor had told him \"to cut back.\" Also, a 22 year old male mentioned that the interview didn't \"differentiate between long term and short term drinking\" since \"college students binge [drink] over the summer.\" Without exception, all participants who made such temporally related suggestions had AUDIT scores above 8. Some respondents who suggested adding \"when do you drink,\" intended the question to address the reasons why people drink. An example is the follow\u00ad ing comment: \"people drink for different reasons and what con\u00ad 957 R. Farzanfar et al. dition they're in and if they're depressed. There should be questions to assess this.\" Question 4- Interviewer Preference The responses to this question were divided into two broad cat\u00ad egories: \"favorable to the live interview\" and \"favorable to the automated interview.\" Sixty two percent of respondents pre\u00ad ferred the live interviewer, while 22% said that they preferred the automated interview and 15% believed there was no differ\u00ad ence between the two. One person gave no explicit answer to this question. The subcategories within the category of \"favor\u00ad able to the live interview\" included the following: and Two individuals said they preferred the live in\u00ad terviewer but also added that it \"depends on ofseveral notable responses in need interaction with people with heart,\" :'1 like the personal touch,\" \"A person gives me a chance to say more,\" etc. Among the people who preferred a live interviewer, 31% thought that the live interviewer asked them the \"right\" questions. Also, 16% in\u00ad dicated that their interview with the computer was problematic such as \"A person understands me better,\" \"computer is confus\u00ad ing. I couldn't find the right answer.\" As suggested above, some respondents framed their preference for the live interviewer. in statements that conveyed their disapproval of the automated In\u00ad terview. Examples include: \"I prefer the person is fake; it is a machine,\" \"Computer only allows yes or no answers,\" \"With computers, you can't ask a question,\" \"Talking to a computer is like talking to a wall.\" Similarly, it seems that for some participants expression ofa fa\u00ad vorable response toward the live interviewer was indicative of perceived problems with the computer. In fact 14% 0: respon\u00ad dents who preferred the live interviewer reported having some problems with the automated interview. A 64 year old male said that \"with the computer I had to think more about the computer than the ideas about drinking.\" Similarly, a 20 year old female said that she was worried that thinking about her answers \"might cause a problem and then I might skip a question.\" Likewise, a 29 year old male said that he \"got mixed up a little bit. It doesn't stop, just keeps going; ifyou miss, the chance is gone!\" Finally, two people who preferred the live interviewer thought that onl.y she had given them the hot line number! Both persons had their second interview with the live interviewer. Therefore, it is pos\u00ad sible that they were better able to recall their conversation with the live interviewer even though the computer also had provided them with the hot line number. Thirteen individuals complained that the computer could not understand them very well. Five among these said that they had to speak too loud so that the com\u00ad puter could understand them. And, three people specifically ex\u00ad pressed frustration with the automated interview. Interestingly, among those who preferred the automated interview (22% ofthe study population) only three individuals said that they had a problem with the computer. The reasons provided by those who preferred the automated interview included \"more privacy/con\u00adfidential\" (32%) and \"non-judgmental\" (18%). The most com\u00ad pelling statement came from one participant who said \"I've been fighting with therapists all my life. I've been getting up and leaving. I didn't feel 1had to with this [the computer].\" An esti\u00ad mated 23% of those who preferred the automated interview ac\u00ad tually said that the live interviewer asked the \"right\" questions. At the same time, 23% said that an automated interview should be followed by an interview with a live person. An interesting dimension ofthe responses in this category was the ambivalence expressed by a few. One respondent said that \"I prefer to be in\u00ad terviewed by the computer but I think a person would be more accurate and have more feeling.\" Another person first expressed her preference for the \"human touch\" and then said that she pre\u00ad fers the computer \"because it doesn't talk back!\" There were also those participants who said they had no prefer\u00ad ence between the computer and the live interviewer or felt that the experience was the same (15%). Responses in this category ran the gamut of \"no preference\" to more detailed comments. Most ofthe respondents who articulated a reason tried to explain why both interviewing methods were appropriate such as the fol\u00ad lowing: \"A person explains more in detail, but computer offers more privacy.\" \"Over the phone questions can be asked by any\u00ad one about anything because there is no one looking at me and judging me.\" Two persons, in fact, indicated that after having ex\u00ad perienced both the automated and the live interviews, they real\u00ad ized that in the future they would be comfortable with both. Finally, two individuals in this category thought the interviewer asked the \"right\" questions as well as \"more\" questions. Discussion Our results are at variance with those presented by some inves\u00ad tigators about people's preference for computers over live inter\u00ad viewers when responding to personal and sensitive questions [4,6]. Several factors might have contributed to the findings of this study: 1) the live interviewer's communication skills and so\u00ad ciability might have been a factor that contributed to the forma\u00ad tion of a \"favorable\" opinion towards the live interviewer. 2) Social desirability is another factor to consider as participants might have wanted to please the interviewer by saying that they preferred her over the computer. In fact, one participant after stating that he had no comments, immediately added \"the inter\u00ad viewer was nice!\" 3) Possible problems with the speech recogni\u00ad tion may be another reason for the participants' preference for the live interviewer. Among the respondents who preferred the live interviewer, 16% (10) had problems with the automated in\u00ad terview. 4) Some studies that have provided evidence of use~' preference for computer-based interviews, have made compan\u00ad sons between automated interviews and traditional face-to-face interviews [19,20]. The fact that in our study both AUDIT inter\u00ad views were conducted over the phone seems to have diminished the awkwardness or discomfort of divulging personal informa\u00ad tion. As one participant said, \"as long as the interview is over the phone, it could be a person or a computer - no difference to me.\" 6) We recruited our study participants by posting advertisements on daily pap~s. The recruitment method was thus a self-referral one as participants were encouraged to call to see \"whether they 958 R. Farzanfar et al. are problem drinkers.\" The very nature of such an act, i.e., to make an attempt to find out whether one in involved in risky health behavior, is charged with emotions. For example, a 66 years old female participant who, after the AUDIT interview, learned that she is not a problem drinker said: \"I'm glad I'm not at high risk. I feel relieved.\" Indeed, a number of participants seemed to be seeking help or thought that the study would be providing some help. These individuals sought to communicate with a live person, someone to offer help, perhaps some counsel\u00ad ing, a sympathetic ear, etc. One individual actually asked the in\u00ad terviewer \"offer treatment?\" Or, another participant who admitted he had been to \"detox,\" said that he preferred a person because he \"could tell more.\" Another participant said: \"some\u00ad one might do the computer interview but not follow through and get further help.\" This evaluation study explored the opinions of users of comput\u00ad er-based and human interviews on problem drinking. Our results differ from some studies that report users' preference for auto\u00ad mated interviews versus human interviews and raise the question that users' preferences for an automated interview versus a live one is a complex issue.

We examine trends in national death certificate data on place of death from 1980 to 1998. During these years the percentage of Americans dying as hospital inpatients decreased from ap - proximately 54 percent to 41 percent. About 310,000 fewer people died in the hospital in1998 than if the proportion of inpatient deaths had not changed since 1980. For certaindiseases the change was much greater. In 1980 whites and African Americans died in thehospital in equal proportions, but in 1998 whites died as inpatients less often than AfricanAmericans. These racial differences and their implications deserve further study. During the past two decades end- of-life care has become an increasingly high-profile issue.1In the 1980s Medi- care introduced the hospice benefit, and nu-merous judicial rulings expanded patients'right to terminate life-sustaining interven-tions. 2In the 1990s the United States Supreme Court rendered three decisions on end-of-lifecare; the Patient Self-Determination Act wasenacted; major research projects to identifyand overcome barriers to better end-of-lifecare were conducted; and initiatives were un - dertaken to expand hospice and educate phy - sicians about end-of-life care. 3Other events not specifically directed at end-of-life care alsomight have altered such care. These includethe introduction of capitation in Medicare, theexpansion of Medicare's postacute care bene -fit, the overall decline in the use of inpatientcare, the expansion of managed care, and theaging of the population. 4 A key issue in end-of-life care is where peo- ple die. The location of death shows where thepatient was receiving care at the very end oflife and suggests what could be done to im-prove that care. If most people die in hospitals,then hospital policies and hospital staff train - ing are particularly important. If more peopledie in nursing homes or skilled nursing facili - ties, these institutions' ability to deal appro - priately with dying becomes more important.If deaths occur in homes, the quality of homecare becomes more pressing. Also, many people in the end-of-life care community look upon an increase in homedeaths favorably, partly because of evidenceHealth Tracking 194 May/June 2004 Flory (jflory@cc.nih.gov) a predoctoral in the Department of Clinical Bioethics, W arren G.Magnuson Clinical Center , National Institutes of Health, in Bethesda, Maryland.

This paper seeks to in - form discussion of end-of-life care policy is - sues by examining trends in place of death inthe context of changes in the health system. Study Methods The National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) has collected death certificate recordsfrom all fifty states since 1980. Death certifi - cates provide information on place of death, aswell as cause of death; region/state/county ofdeath; and the age, sex, and race of the de - ceased. We have analyzed NVSS data for theyears 1980-1998. Prior to 1989, place-of-death category codes used in death certificates were as follows: (1)hospital\u2014inpatient, (2) hospital\u2014outpatientor emergency room, (3) hospital\u2014dead on hospital\u2014patient status unknown,(5) hospital\u2014patient status not on certificate,(6) other institutions, (7) dead on arrival\u2014hospital name not given, (8) hospital and pa-tient status not stated, and (9) all other re-ported entries. Because of incomplete codingpractices before 1989, a large number of U.S.counties coded most or all of their in-hospitaldeaths as \"hospital\u2014patient status not on cer - tificate,\" failing to distinguish among inpa - tient, outpatient, dead on arrival, and emer - gency room deaths. To create reasonablycomparable statistics from 1980 through 1998,we included only data from county-year com - binations with fully distinct records of inpa - tient deaths. In the original data the total num - ber of counties for 1980-1988 was 28,148,covering 18.5 million deaths. We have elimi - nated all counties with any reported \"hospi - tal\u2014patient status not on certificate\" deaths,leaving 22,689 counties (81 percent) and 12.7million deaths (69 percent). Place-of-death coding has been uniform throughout the United States since 1989. The\"hospital\u2014patient status not on certificate\"code has been eliminated. In addition to thefour well-defined hospital categories (1-4)listed above, nursing home and residentialdeaths have been identified as such, and allother deaths have been recorded either under asingle \"other\" category or as \"place of deathunknown.\" The sample for 1989-1998 includesall of the 22.5 million deaths for the period,adding to a total of 35.2 million observationsfor 1980-1998. In the results we present here,the \"hospital\u2014inpatient\" category is used asthe basis of analyses. We studied trends in the proportion of in - patient deaths by age, sex, race, cause of death,and region of death across the time period.Coding for the detailed race of the deceasedwas uniform in the two subsample periods of1980-1988 and 1989-1998, so we have groupedthe racial information into three main catego - ries: white, black, and other. Although post-1989 data have details on Hispanic origin, theHispanic population has been included in the\"white\" category for consistency across years.Causes of death on the certificates are re-corded with International Classification of Diseases, Eighth Revision (ICD-8, pre-1989) and ICD-9(Ninth Revision, post-1989) codes. We havedistinguished eight leading causes of death:chronic heart disease, acute myocardial infarc-tion (AMI), cancer, chronic obstructive pul-monary disease (COPD), stroke, pneumoniaand influenza, diabetes, and chronic liver dis - ease. All other causes have been grouped as\"other.\" Regional analyses compared western,midwestern, southern, and eastern regions ofthe United States. Counties were also distin - guished using the urban/rural continuum codedeveloped by the U.S. Department of Agricul - ture's Economic Research Service. 7 The only statistical tool in our analysis is testing for the significance of differences be - tween proportions. Because of the number ofobservations, all differences in proportions re - ported in Exhibit 1 are statistically significantatp<.001. For finer subgroups reported in the text, the sizes of the samples are still largeenough to guarantee that any difference in in - patient death proportions at least as great as 2percent is statistically significant at p<.05.Trends HEALTH AFFAIRS ~ V olume 23, Number 3 195 at BOSTON UNIV MEDICAL LIBRARY on August 5, 2011 Health Affairs by content.healthaffairs.org Downloaded from Study Results The percentage of persons dying as in- patients held steady from 1980 to 1983. Since 1983 the rate of in-hospital deaths in theUnited States declined at a fairly constant rate,from a high of about 54 percent to a low ofaround 41 percent in 1998 (Exhibit 2). Duringthe 1990s the decline was 8 percent\u2014nearly 1percent a year. Deaths occurring at home andin nursing homes correspondingly increased.Between 1990 and 1998, home deaths rose from17 percent to 22 percent, and nursing homedeaths, from 16 percent to 22 percent. The re - maining deaths occurred mainly in outpatientmedical facilities (7 percent) and other un - specified locations (4 percent). Patients whowere dead on arrival or with status not speci - fied on the death certificate constituted about3 percent of deaths recorded in the 1990s. While the proportion of in-hospital deaths fell for each major cause of death, place ofdeath has changed most for cancer (Exhibit 3).Between 1980 and 1998 the rate of inpatientdeaths from cancer declined from 70 percentto 37 percent. The percentage of patients withdiabetes and COPD who died in the hospitalfell by more than 15 percent each (Exhibit 1),as deaths attributable to AMI dropped lessHealth Tracking 196 May/June 2004EXHIBIT 1 Demographic Data And Inpatient Death Rates, United States, 1980 And 1998 Percent of deaths classified as inpatient Percent of population 1980 1998 All observations (N = 35.2 million deaths) 100 54 41 Age (years) <65 65-7475-8485+252029265260564642474434 Sex MaleFemale495154544240 Race WhiteBlack861254544048 Cause of death Chronic diseaseAcute myocardial infarctionCancerChronic obstructive pulmonary disease StrokePneumonia and 57431444470 66 59665674354037 47 50604160 Region NortheastMidwestSouthWest202437195653544944394436 SOURCE: National Vital Statistics System Death Certificate Records. at BOSTON UNIV MEDICAL LIBRARY on August 5, 2011 Health Affairs by content.healthaffairs.org Downloaded from than 4 percent. Cancer is also unusual in that data from the 1990s show that most of the shift out of the hospital has been toward private residences,which increased by 15 percent from 1989 to1998 to account for 38 percent of all cancerdeaths; in the same time period, cancer deathsin nursing homes rose just 4 percent, to 17 per-cent. For other diseases, declines in inpatientdeaths were evenly divided between increasesin home and nursing home deaths. In 1980 there was almost no difference in rates of inpatient death between whites andAfrican Americans (Exhibit 4). However, by1998 whites died in the hospital much less fre -quently (40 percent) than African Americansdid (48 percent). The proportion of in-hospitaldeaths declined for both races for every majorcause of death, yet for each cause it declinedmore for whites. During the 1980s and 1990s the change in in-hospital mortality was similar for bothsexes. However, the comparison betweensexes differed for African Americans andwhites (Exhibit 4). African American andwhite women had especially different pros-pects of dying in the hospital. In 1998 whitewomen died in the hospital 39 percent of thetime, while African American women did so50 percent of the time.Trends HEALTH AFFAIRS ~ V olume 23, Number 3 197EXHIBIT 2Decline In Percentage Of Americans Dying As Inpatients, 1980-1998, And Percentage Of U.S. Home And Nursing Home Deaths During The 1990s EXHIBIT 3 Decline In Percentage Of Americans Dying As Inpatients, By Cause Of Death, 1980-1998 at BOSTON UNIV MEDICAL LIBRARY on August 5, 2011 Health Affairs by content.healthaffairs.org Downloaded from With regard to age, the proportion of in- hospital deaths was highest for deceased peo - ple ages 65-74 years, 47 percent in 1998 (Ex - hibit 1). Nursing home deaths increase greatly with advanced age. In 1998, 24 percent of peo-ple ages 75-84, and 45 percent of those olderthan age 85, died in nursing homes. These rela-tionships between age and place of death didnot change much during the study period. Rates of in-hospital death differed around the country. Inpatient death in 1998 was morelikely in the Northeast and South and lesslikely in the West and Midwest (Exhibit 1).Analysis according to how urban a county was(as classified by the urban/rural continuumcode) did not point to any trend variation overtime. Inpatient deaths declined at roughly thesame rate in metropolitan and nonmetro-politan counties. Discussion And Policy Implications During the last two decades of the twenti - eth century there was a noticeable change inthe way Americans died. The hospital ceasedto be the setting of death for most Americans.By 1998 more Americans died at home or in anursing home (45 percent) than died as hospi - tal inpatients (41 percent). Since more than 2.4million Americans die each year, the substan - tial shift in the place of death since 1980 meansthat in 1998 approximately 310,000 peopledied outside the hospital who would have diedin the hospital if the distribution had been thesame as it was two decades earlier. Impor - tantly, this shift in place of death occurred rel - atively steadily during the 1980s and 1990s.This suggests that no single event during thatperiod triggered the change. Reductions in in-hospital deaths have been evolutionary, notrevolutionary. This shift out of the hospital has implica- tions for ensuring that dying patients receivegood end-of-life care. Moving outside the hos-pital setting does not ensure a good death. Itcould represent movement to a skilled nursingfacility, where the environment and the issuesfor quality of dying might be similar to those ofa hospital. Hospices, homes, and traditionalnursing homes have their own potential prob - lems. Thus, one should conclude not that end-of-life care has necessarily improved but ratherthat quality of care in places other than hospi - tals is becoming more important. Death certificate records indicate that ap - proximately 500,000 people die annually innursing homes. Nursing home staff need ade - quate resources and training to fill their in - creasingly important role in end-of-life care. Inaddition, as hospices and home care agenciesrapidly expand to meet the needs of the grow - ing numbers of Americans dying in their ownhomes, quality of care must not be allowed toerode. 8 /c110Racial differences. The growing gap in in-hospital death rates between races was un - anticipated. In 1980 the overall rates of inpa -Health Tracking 198 May/June 2004EXHIBIT 4Rates Of Inpatient Death By Race And Sex, 1980-1998 at BOSTON UNIV MEDICAL LIBRARY on August 5, 2011 Health Affairs by content.healthaffairs.org Downloaded from tient death for whites and African Americans were identical; during the study period therates for the two races diverged. These data areconsistent with data showing that AfricanAmericans tend to receive more intensive andexpensive care in the final year of life. 9These racial differences in place of death may be theresult of differences in preferences, with Afri - can Americans more likely to choose life-pro - longing procedures and less likely to completeadvance care directives and agree to do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders. 10 However, evidence that ter - minally ill African Americansreceive less care from familymembers and friends couldmean that more AfricanAmericans depend on hospi - tals for final care, regardlessof their preferences. 11It is also possible that African Ameri-cans and other populationgroups lack access to hospiceand home care services in their region.Whether racial differences in care come fromdifferent preferences or disparities in access,or both, is an important question for future re-search. /c110Cancer. The proportion of in-hospital deaths has fallen farther for cancer than for anyother disease. In 1998 only about a third of can - cer patients died as inpatients, nearly revers - ing the ratio of two decades earlier. Further - more, unlike for other major causes of death,the shift for cancer has been toward residencesfar more than toward nursing homes. Thesedata, combined with data indicating that asmuch as a half of cancer patients receive hos - pice care at the end of life, suggest acceptanceof hospice-directed home deaths amongoncologists and oncology patients. 12It appears that special attention to end-of-life care forcancer has altered practices dramatically. Onepossible explanation for the relatively slightchanges for other causes of death, such asCOPD and heart failure, is that that impendingdeath from these causes is less predictable.Without very reliable prognoses, it may bemore difficult to stop life-prolonging treat -ment in favor of hospice and other kinds ofout-of-hospital palliative care. /c110Medicare spending. Care for the dying is very expensive, consuming roughly 27 per - cent of Medicare's spending for the 5 percentof beneficiaries who die. It has long beenhoped that such costs could be reduced by de - creasing in-hospital deaths, but the percentageof Medicare spending during the last year oflife has not fluctuated much even as in-hospi - tal death has declined a great deal. 13The steady decline in hospital deaths,combined with data suggest - ing no significant change inthe payments for individualswho die or the proportion ofMedicare expenditures goingto them, indicates that reduc - ing out-of-hospital deathdoes not save money at thee n do fl i f e . 14 /c110Study limitations. The principal limitation of this study is that the outcome measure is site ofdeath, which is not necessarily the same placethat the patient spent most of his or her lastmonths. Death as a hospital inpatient does notrule out the possibility that a patient was dy-ing at home up until the final twenty-fourhours before death. The other important limitation is in the quality of the data from the 1980s. Thirty-onepercent of deceased people in that decade livedin counties where in-hospital death could notbe distinguished from other facility-baseddeath. Hence, unlike the complete 1990s data,the trend data for the 1980s are only an esti - mate. However, since the 1980s trend data de - scribe just under 70 percent of U.S. deaths dur - ing the 1980s, they are probably an adequaterepresentation.

Effect of Patient Gender on Late-Life Depression Management SUSAN M. FRAYNE, M.D., M.P.H.,1KATHERINE M. SKINNER, Ph.D.,2,3,*HAI LIN, M.D.,3 ARLENE S. ASH, Ph.D.,4and KAREN M. FREUND, M.D., M.P.H.4,5 ABSTRACT Purpose : To determine whether patient gender influences physicians' management of late- life major depression in older and younger elderly patients. Methods : In 1996-2001, physician subjects viewed a professionally produced videotape vi- gnette portraying an elderly patient meeting diagnostic criteria for major depression, then an-swered interviewer-administered questions about differential diagnosis and treatment. Pa-tient gender and other characteristics were systematically varied in different versions of thevideotape, but clinical content was held constant. This was a stratified random sample of 243internists and family physicians with Veterans Health Administration (VA) or non-VA am-bulatory care practices in the Northeastern United States. Outcomes were whether physiciansfollowed a guideline-recommended management approach: treating with antidepressants ormental health referral or both and seeing the patient for follow-up within 2 weeks. Results : Only 19% of physicians recommended treating depression (12% recommended an- tidepressants and 7% mental health referral), and 43% recommended follow-up within 2weeks. Patient gender did not influence management recommendations in either younger old(67 year old) or older old (79 year old) patients ( p/H110220.12 for all comparisons). Conclusions : Gender disparities previously documented in the management of major con- ditions are not seen for the management of depression, a potentially stigmatized conditionthat does not require resource-intense interventions. 919INTRODUCTION GENDER DISPARITIES IN INTENSITY of medical care have been scrutinized for over a decade.1 Numerous studies find women less likely thanmen to receive intensive interventions for a rangeof conditions. 1-5Much less is known about the ef- fect of patient gender on the primary care man-agement of major depression; indeed, the genderdisparity effect could even be reversed for thisspecific condition. Given the high prevalence ofdepression women, 6,7it is possible that under- 1Center for Health Care Evaluation, VA Palo Alto Healthcare System, and Stanford University, Palo Alto, Califor- nia. 2School of Public Health, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts. 3Center for Health Quality, Outcomes and Economic Research, VA Medical Center, Bedford, Massachusetts. 4Section of General Internal Medicine, and 5Women's Health Unit, Evans Department of Medicine, Boston Med- ical Center, and Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts. *Deceased.This material is based on work supported by the Department of Veterans Affairs Health Services R&D grants GEN 97-023 and RCD 98-312, and National Institute on Aging grant AG12437-03.

To address this gap in the literature, we used an experimental design to determine whetherphysicians' management of late-life major de-pression varied as a function of patient gender.With women's longer life expectancy, aging is animportant women's health issue, 9,10and clini- cians often undertreat depression in elderly pa-tients. 11Therefore, a secondary question was whether depression management varied by pa-tient gender in younger old and older old agestrata. MATERIALS AND METHODS Overview of experimental design After viewing a professionally acted videotape vignette portraying an elderly patient who meetsdiagnostic criteria for major depression (in whichpatient gender and other characteristics were sys-tematically varied but clinical content was heldconstant), practicing physicians answered struc-tured, interviewer-administered questions abouttheir diagnosis and management recommenda-tions. This paper reports on one aspect of a largerstudy of late-life depression management in themedical setting, but the findings reported hereabout the effect of patient gender answer the pri-mary question of the overall study. Study meth-ods are described in detail elsewhere. 12,13 Physician subjects A random stratified sample of internists and family physicians with active ambulatory carepractices were selected in New England (Con-necticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Vermont,New Hampshire, Maine); recruitment was ex-tended to New York to assure an adequate sam-pling frame. Physicians were contacted by tele-phone to enlist their participation prior to ascheduled in-person interview. The InstitutionalReview Boards at New England Research Insti-tute, Boston University, and each of the 10 par-ticipating Veterans Health Administration (VA)facilities approved this study, and physiciansprovided written informed consent. In the first phase of our study, primary care physicians were randomly selected from Board ofRegistration in Medicine lists in 1996-1997 based on listed specialty (internal medicine or familypractice). Sampling was stratified according tophysician gender, specialty, years since medicalschool graduation, and race. In a second recruitment phase, we replicated the study in a VA setting. The reason for repli-cating the study in VA was to examine whetherfindings would be consistent in a setting wherewomen represent a minority population andwhere mental health issues are emphasized sys-temwide. This second phase of the study wasinitiated while recruitment for the non-VAphase was still ongoing. We randomly selectedstaff physicians from VA Department of Medi-cine/Ambulatory Care lists in 1999-2001, strat-ified according to physician gender and spe-cialty status in lists provided by theDepartment of Medicine/Ambulatory Care ateach VA facility (the size of the VA samplingframe did not make it possible to stratify onphysician race). In VA hospitals, women are aminority population, 14making VA a unique en- vironment in which to examine gender differ-ences in care. For the VA phase, we includednot only primary care providers but also med-ical subspecialists because they are responsiblefor a substantial proportion of the primary careprovided in VA. Prospective subjects were recruited by tele- phone after receipt of an introductory letter ask-ing them to participate in a study about \"physi-cians' clinical decision making.\" Subjects whoparticipated received $100 (or its equivalent in ed-ucational materials). Interview procedures Physician subjects viewed the depression vi- gnette, then answered questions from a field-tested protocol (administered by a trained inter-viewer) about the probability of each condition intheir differential diagnosis; what tests, referrals,or medications they would order; and when theywould want to see the patient back for follow-up.The interview ended with items characterizingthe physician's background and clinical practice.Physicians were not informed that the patient inthe vignette was an actor and were unaware ofthe study hypotheses. The interviewer instructedthe physician to use his or her own practice as theframe of reference when selecting managementrecommendations.FRAYNE ET AL. 9205242_e08_p919-925 10/11/04 12:52 PM Page 920 Videotaped vignettes In a 5-minute, professionally produced video- tape, an actor portrays a patient meeting Diag- nostic and Statistical Manual , 4th ed (DSM-IV), cri- teria15for late-life major depression (anhedonia, anorexia, weight loss, insomnia, fatigue, psy-chomotor retardation, and thoughts of death). Be-cause depression commonly occurs in the pri-mary care setting with somatic rather than moodsymptoms, 16there was no mention in the vignette of feelings of depression or suicidal ideation. Tomaximize the realism of the vignette: (1) real pri-mary care cases were used as the foundation forcase development, and role-plays of these casesby clinicians were used to guide script develop-ment, (2) lay terms were used whenever possible,(3) three panels of practicing physicians were con-vened to confirm the authenticity of the script,and (4) an internist was present during filming toassure appropriate and consistent nonverbalcues. (The internist provided real-time feedbackto actors on their nonverbal communication, re-quiring, for example, that they cast their eyesdownward at the same point in the script.) In ad-dition, we interviewed subjects in their clinicalpractice and asked them to manage the case as ifthe patient were coming to their own practice. Patient gender was systematically varied in dif- ferent versions of the videotape, as were other de-mographic characteristics (including age of thepatient depicted, which was 67 or 79 years old,race of the patient, and in the non-VA group, so-cioeconomic status of the patient, indicated by oc-cupation and clothing selection), using a previ-ously developed methodology. 12,17However, the clinical content and nonverbal communicationwere held constant. Dependent variables Physicians who included depression in their differential diagnosis and assigned it a probabil-ity/H1135050% were considered to have identified de- pression. Physicians were considered to have rec-ommended guideline-based 18,19treatment if they recommended an antidepressant or mental healthreferral or both at the initial visit. Monitoring wasguideline-concordant if the physician recom-mended follow-up within 2 weeks. Of note, theAgency for Health Research and Quality (AHRQ)distributed its depression clinical guidelines inbooklet format nationally in 1993, well beforesample selection began.Analysis The primary, a priori objective of this study was to determine whether patient gender influencedthe identification and management of depression.We completed bivariate analyses comparing ratesof identification, treatment, and monitoring of de-pression for female vs. male patients depicted inthe videotape and by patient gender-age dyads(older old female, older old male, younger old fe-male, younger old male). We also conducted lo-gistic regression analyses testing the effect of pa-tient gender on the identification, treatment, andfollow-up for depression after adjusting forphysician characteristics (physician gender, yearspostgraduation from medical school, specialiststatus, VA vs. non-VA status). In sensitivityanalyses, we repeated these analyses of the treat-ment and follow-up outcomes for the subset ofphysicians who reported that they provided pri-mary care. Because baseline physician and case-load characteristics differed between the VA andnon-VA physicians, we also conducted stratifiedanalyses to evaluate for any confounding of find-ings by practice site (VA or non-VA). We usedchi-square tests for discrete variables and ttests for continuous variables and conducted Fisher'sexact test in instances of expected cell counts /H110215. The unit of analysis was the physician subject. Weconsidered p/H110210.05 as statistically significant. For our main analyses (gender comparisons), we had /H1102280% power to detect treatment differ- ences of /H1134915%. In analyses of interaction effects, our power to detect differences between groupswas limited; these latter comparisons should beconsidered exploratory. RESULTS Among contacted physicians from our sam- pling frame, the response rate was 85% in phase1 (128 non-VA physicians) and 78% in phase 2(115 VA physicians), yielding a total sample ofn/H11005243 physicians. The mean age of the full sam- ple was 46.1 years, and 58% were male. The VAand non-VA physicians differed on practice char-acteristics: 50% vs. 26%, respectively, self-re-ported that they provided some specialty care;they saw a mean of 38 vs. 75 outpatients per week;9% vs. 62% of their caseloads were female; and69% vs. of their caseloads were /H11022age 65 ( p/H11021 0.001 these comparisons).PATIENT GENDER AND DEPRESSION MANAGEMENT 9215242_e08_p919-925 10/11/04 12:52 PM Page 921 We found that 64% of physicians identified de- pression, defined as assigning at least a 50% prob-ability to depression on their differential diagno-sis. Based on the information in the vignette foran initial visit, 19% recommended treatment fordepression, that is, 12% recommended antide-pressant medication, and 7% recommended amental health referral. Whereas standard clinicalguidelines recommend follow-up within 2 weeksfor patients with depression, 18,1943% of subjects recommended follow-up within this time frame(time to follow-up had a range of 2-150 days). Pa-tient gender did not influence the likelihood thatdepression would be identified or that guideline-concordant treatment and follow-up would berecommended (Table 1). In logistic regressionanalyses adjusting for physician characteristics(physician gender, years postgraduation, spe-cialty status, and VA or non-VA status), therecontinued to be no statistically significant gendereffect: odds ratio (with 95% confidence interval)(OR[95% CI]) for identification of depression was0.91 (0.53-1.55), for treatment was 0.93 (0.49-1.79),and for follow-up within 2 weeks was 0.89 (0.51-1.46).There were also no systematic differences in identification, treatment, or follow-up of depres-sion by gender-age dyad. Differences noted werenot statistically significant and were not consis-tent across age group or gender to suggest a pat-tern of management differences based on age orgender (Table 2). Among the subset who provided primary care, there were likewise no gender differences in treat-ment or follow-up. Despite differences in case-load between VA vs. non-VA physicians and de-spite the fact that there were isolated differencesin depression management among VA vs. non-VA physicians (reported elsewhere 13), the lack of effect of patient gender on depression identifica-tion and management was comparable in VA andnon-VA settings. DISCUSSION Many physicians recognized late-life depres- sion in a realistic videotaped clinical scenario ofan elderly patient with somatic symptoms whomet the criteria for the diagnosis. However, de-spite the availability of national depression man-agement guidelines that were widely dissemi-nated at least 3 years prior to our first inter-view, 18,19most subjects did not recommend early intervention or early follow-up. This lack of rec-ommended intensive management is indepen-dent of patient gender, and exploratory analysesdo not detect a gender effect in either older oryounger patients with late-life depression. We found a lack of effect of patient gender on depression management. This is consistent withprior work indicating a lack of effect of patientgender on depression treatment (with pharma-cotherapy or psychotherapy) by psychiatrists, al-FRAYNE ET AL. 922 TABLE 1.

Of note, examining the effect of patient gender on depression management was the primary ob-jective of our overall study, and our study wasdesigned to have ample statistical power to de-tect important gender differences. Therefore, al-though we observed no difference in the man-agement of depression for female vs. malepatients, we consider it important to report thisnegative finding so as to avoid contributing topublication bias. 22,23 Interestingly, our findings contrast with a con- sistent pattern in many other studies suggestingthat women are less likely than men to receive in-tensive interventions for a range of conditions. 1-4 Our study was not designed to understand thereasons for lack of gender differences, but ourfindings raise intriguing possibilities. First, it ispossible that gender disparities in intensity oftreatment are most pronounced for resource-in-tensive interventions, such as invasive cardio-vascular procedures, kidney transplants, colono-scopies, or state-of-the-art HIV treatments. 1-5 Indeed, for such simple interventions as fre-quency of visits or routine laboratory testing, wo-men tend to receive more care than men. 1,24,25 Our finding may reflect the fact that depressionmanagement requires lower intensity interven-tions. Second, some studies find that cliniciansare more likely to attribute women's physicalsymptoms to psychological causes, sometimesoverdiagnosing psychiatric illness in women. 26,27 Thus, although we found no effect of patient gen-der on the identification of depression, physiciansmight have a heightened responsiveness to de-pression in women. This could offset any generaltendency to offer less interventions to women. The overall low rate of intervention that we re- port is consistent with prior work documentinglow treatment rates for depression in elderly pa- tients despite the morbidity of untreated diseaseand the availability of effective treatments. 11,28,29 There are three major potential explanations forthis observation. The first relates to patient pref-erences, that is, the possibility that elderly pa-tients decline recommended treatment for de-pression. Our experimental design eliminatedthis explanation, as physicians' recommendationswere independent of patient feedback. The sec-ond potential explanation is that the higherprevalence of chronic illness, physical disability,and loss of independence seen with advancingage adds complexity to depression managementand promotes therapeutic nihilism. 30,31In our study, this would not be expected to contribute,as the patients depicted in the videotape pre-sented identically: for all gender-age dyads, thepatient was married, living independently, andwithout serious chronic illness. The third possi-ble explanation is that there is a direct effect ofageism, with elderly patients being selectivelyundertreated. Our study design was ideallysuited to examine this possibility. Although wedocumented low rates of recommending treat-ment, we found no age gradient. Treatment rec-ommendations were similar whether the physi-cian was assigned to a patient age 67 or 79 yearsold. This does not exclude the possibility thatthere is a threshold effect of age on intensity oftreatment, with the age of patients depicted in thevignette all falling above this threshold. Our methodology has several particular strengths. We used a rigorous experimental ap-proach that overcomes case mix problems 32in- herent in the observational designs of earlierwork. 20,21This allowed us to directly compare the management of female and male older old andyounger old patients with identical symptoms.Sample size was chosen to assure that therewould be ample statistical power to detect anymeaningful differences in the management of fe-male and male patients and older old andyounger old patients. The methodology used inthis study has been applied to a variety of ques-tions and has been shown in work by us and oth-ers to be capable of detecting important differ-ences in clinical management in different patientgroups and in different physician groups. 12,13,17,33 Finally, by examining the management of olderold patients with depression, we address an agegroup for whom the research literature is partic-ularly sparse. 34PATIENT GENDER AND DEPRESSION MANAGEMENT 9235242_e08_p919-925 10/11/04 12:52 PM Page 923 Limitations Several limitations of this approach should also be raised. The first relates to external validity:physicians' actual practice might differ from theirresponses to the videotaped scenario. For exam-ple, the fact that the patient did not report suici-dal ideation or that physicians did not have theopportunity to personally interview the patientin the vignette (e.g., to obtain additional infor-mation about the severity of the depression)could have led some to hesitate to initiate treat-ment. However, clinical vignettes have good va-lidity when compared with other methodologiesfor measuring quality of care. 35We took many steps to assure the vignettes' realism and to fa-cilitate physicians' viewing the case as a patientin their own practices. Indeed, physicians madespontaneous comments: \"I saw that patient thismorning.\" Second, it is important to recognizethat physicians' responses reflected their recom-mendations for a single visit with a continuity pa-tient. It is possible that they would have initiatedtreatment at follow-up visits. However, early in-tervention is the standard of care for depres-sion, 18,19and less than half of the subjects planned to see the patient in follow-up within 2 weeks.Third, the patient depicted in the video was liv-ing independently and was relatively healthy,and all physician subjects practiced in the North-eastern United States. The generalizability of ourfindings to institutionalized or infirm elderly pa-tients and to physicians practicing in other geo-graphic regions is unknown. CONCLUSIONS Our study points to a continuing need for more aggressive treatment of depression in allelderly patients, independent of gender, sup-porting the importance of recent studies exam-ining promising interventions for depression inthe primary care setting. 36-40Unlike the gender effects reported previously for problems re-quiring intensive intervention, we found thatpatient gender and patient gender-age dyad donot influence well-established, low-intensity treat-ments are available. These findings provide ad-ditional clues in the disparities literature andcan serve as a foundation for future work ex-amining why such disparities are seen for some but not all conditions.

Determining the medical school deans' attitudes toward and evaluation of primary care in their institutions and in medical schools nationally is critical to our understanding the issues facing primary care medicine in academia. In 1999, deans of half of the U.S. allo\u00ad pathic medical schools reported it was more important for their institutions to train future primary care physicians than to train future specialist physi\u00ad cians.n We do not know whether this supportive view of primary care trans\u00ad lates into supportive medical school policies and structures and into strong primary care faculties and programs. In this study, we surveyed the deans of all U.S. allopathic medical schools to bet\u00ad ter understand these matters. METHOD Design In 2000, we mailed questionnaires to deans of the 130 allopathic medical school campusesin the United States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. To identify the names, addresses, and tele\u00ad phone numbers of the deans, we accessed medical school Web sites and supple\u00ad mented this search with telephone inquir\u00ad ies to the schools. Nonrespondents were contacted by telephone two weeks after the mailing and replacement question\u00ad naires were sent if necessary. The ques\u00ad tionnaire contained 43 multipart items regardingthe organizationofprimarycare at the school and in departments and divisions of family medicine, general in\u00ad ternal medicine, and general pediatrics; the dean's attitudes toward academic pri\u00ad mary care; the dean's evaluation of the primary care faculty, programs, and re\u00ad sources; and the school's efforts to strengthen academic primary care at their institution. The instrument was pilot tested by six former allopathic medical school deans. The Boston University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board approved the study. Data and Variables To understand the organization of aca\u00ad demic primary care at each school, we inquired whether the school had a for\u00ad mal department of family medicine and divisions of general internal medicine and general pediatrics or their equiva\u00ad lents. We also asked about the nature of the current relationships among these departments and divisions. We inquired whether a dean for primary care existed at the school, collected information on the current number of full-time doctoral faculty, and asked the deans to project growth over the next five years in both the primary care departments and divi\u00ad sions and in other clinical and nonclini\u00ad cal departments. We inquired about the percentages of the preclinical curriculum (traditional medical school years one and two) and the clinical curriculum (traditional medical school years three and four) devoted to primary care and the propor\u00ad tion taught by primary care faculty. In addition, we asked about the degree of coordination or integration of the gen\u00ad eralist department and divisions in teaching these curricula. To understand the deans' attitudes, we asked them the degree to which they agreed or disagreed with 11 indicator statements addressing finances, re\u00ad search, and the role and influence of primary care faculty at the medical school. The deans' evaluated each of the pri\u00ad mary care disciplines (family medicine, general internal medicine, and general pediatrics) at his or her institution in relation to the norm for the school's nonprimary care clinical departments. They were asked to consider 12 factors pertaining to the clinical, educational, and research roles of the genetl!ist fac\u00ad ulty and the financial resources of each primary care academic unit. The factors were assessed on six-point Likert-type scales (1 = \"worse than nonprimary care clinical departments\" to 6 = \"bet\u00ad ter than nonprimary care clinical de\u00ad partments\"). We compared the deans' mean ratings to a score of 3.5 (the midpoint on the scale) to determine whether the particular primary care de\u00ad partment or division was viewed more or less favorably than other clinical de\u00ad partments. Thus, a mean .score greater than 3.5 would indicate that deans rated the generalist department or division more favorably than other clinical de\u00ad partments, whereas a score less than 3.5 would indicate a lessfavorable rating. In addition, we compared the deans' rat\u00ad ings across family medicine, general in\u00ad ternal medicine, and general pediatrics. We combined the 12 scores for each factor, giving equal weights to each fac\u00ad tor, to create a summative measure. Finally, we assessed the measures the medical school had taken to strengthen its primary care departments, divisions, programs, and faculty. We inquired about 13 potential interventions in medical school policy, medicaleducation, and ad\u00ad ministrative and financial support. To assess the representativeness of our sample, we compared the character\u00ad istics of the medical schools of respond\u00ading and nonresponding deans using data provided by the Association of Ameri\u00ad can Medical Colleges (AAMC). We performed sensitivity analyses by determining what impact certain medi\u00ad cal school characteristics would have on the deans' responses (e.g., public versus private, the medical schools' research intensity). An institution wasdefined as \"research intensive\" if greater than or equal to 30% of the medical school's revenues were from research grant dol\u00ad lars as reported in the AAMC's data\u00ad base, an approximate median split.

Using the finite population correction factor, based on overall sampling from 64% schools, 95% confidence intervals for the percentages reported are accurate to within 3%. The deans' ratings of family medi\u00ad cine, general internal medicine, and general pediatrics relative to nonpri\u00ad mary care clinical departments at the medical school in general were com\u00ad pared through a one-factor repeated measuresanalysisofvariance. We useda two-way repeated measures analysis of variance to determine the impact of medical school characteristics. Where overall differences in ratings were signif\u00ad icant (at p < .05), pairwise comparisons were performed usingTukey's procedure to identify specificdifferences in ratings. RESULTS Medical Schools' Characteristics Deans from 83 (64%) allopathic medi\u00ad cal schools responded, and at least 76 (58%) responded to each question, un\u00ad less otherwise indicated. Fifty-two percent of the deans had assumedtheir positionssince 1996,25% since 1999. Most deans had professional backgrounds in clinical departments; the largest percentages were from de\u00ad partments of medicine (40%) or psychi\u00ad atry(10%),and or 4%, respectively). Eight per\u00ad cent ofthe deanspreviouslybelongedto a basic medical science department. Sixty-one percent of the responding deans were from' private medical schools. Thinrfive percent of the med\u00ad ieal schools were located in the South, 23% in the Northeast, 26% in the Mid\u00adwest, and 16% in the West. The schools had a median of 473 medical students, 635 full-time faculty, and total revenues of $128 million. There were no statisti\u00adcally significant differences between' re\u00ad sponding and nonresponding medical schools regarding these variables. Organization of Primary Care Table 1 shows the proportion of schools with departments of family medicine, divisions of general internal medicine, and general pediatrics, their interrela\u00ad tionships, and the numbers and percent\u00ad ages of faculty in these primary care departments and divisions. Eighty-three percent of the deans an\u00ad ticipated an increase in the number of full-time doctoral level faculty in the primary care departments or divisions over the upcomingfiveyears,which was similar to the deans' estimates for all clinical departments (82%) and non\u00ad clinical departments (82%) at their medical schools over the same period (data not shown). The mean projected change in number of faculty was 12%. There were no differences in projected changesforclinical versus nonclinicalde\u00ad partment faculty; for primary care versus nonprimary care faculty; or between fac\u00ad ulty in family medicine, general internal medicine, and general pediatrics. The deans' characterizations of the interrelationships among the three gen\u00ad eralist departments and divisions are also shown in Table 1. Only one medi\u00ad cal school had a fully integrated primary care department. Deans indicated they preferred more integration of primary care activities than their institutions had at present. Sixty-one percent pre\u00ad ferred some integration, but only five (6%) preferred complete integration. A dean for primary care existed in 14 (17%) medical schools. This dean pro\u00ad vided leadership for the school's primary care curriculum for medical students (12 schools), for primary care research (ten schools), and for relationships with pri- ACADEMIC MEDICINE, VOL. 79, No. III NOVEMBER 2004 -\"'-~~--------'--------1097 -----------------Table 2 Indicator Statement % Agree It is more difficult for faculty without 'bench' science research backgrounds to beeffective medical school leaders 22 The main role ofprimary care istobring in patients that support the institution's clinical and ~~~~ ~ There is a great deal of conflict and competition among the primary care disciplines in medical schools 34 Generalists should be the core faculty of the medical school Primary care facUlty and their departments/divisions exert insufficient influence on the policies and priorities ofmost medical schools There are not enough primary care role models for medical students toemulate In general, primary care faculty are not held in high esteem by other faculty It is appropriate for government to preferentially support primary care faculty and education Primary care needs financial support from the rredical school to survive There is a rich research and intellectual base for academic primary care Research Isas important for primary care departments/divisions as it is for other deparlments/ divisions 46 49 60 60t:j: 65t:j: 77t > deans of research\u00b7intensive institutions (p < .05). mary care physicians and services in the community (ten schools). At seven of these schools, this dean was responsible for the primary care curriculum for resi\u00ad dents, and at five schools the dean was responsible for primary care clinical ser\u00ad vices. Seven of these schools provided a separatebudgetforthe primarycaredean. Fifteen percent cifthe preclinical cur\u00ad riculum, on average, was devoted to primary care (range 0-90%), and pri\u00ad mary care faculty taught 25% of this curriculum (range 0-loo%). Approxi\u00ad mately 60% of deans reported moderate to high levels of integration among their primary care departments and di\u00ad visions for teaching the preclinical curriculum; 13% had no coordination. On average, a higher proportion of the clinical curriculum was devoted to pri\u00ad mary care (37%, range 7-70%) and taught by primary care faculty (39%, range 8-1OO%). The level of integra\u00ad tion among generalist departments and divisions in teaching this clinical cur\u00adriculum wasmoderate to high in 34% of institutions (whereas 17% reported no coordination). Deans' Attitudes toward Academic Primary Care The deans' responses to 11 indicator statements on academic primary care are shown in Table 2. Only 30% agreed with the view that \"the main role of primary care departments/divisions is to bring in patients that support the insti\u00ad tution's clinical and educational enter\u00ad prise.\" Forty-six percent \"generalistsshouldbe the corefacultyof the medical school,\" but 60% believed that there were not enough generalist faculty role models. Deans of public and non-research-intensive institutions were more likely to agree that primary care faculty are not held in highesteem (p = .01 and .02, respectively). There were no other significant differences in atti\u00ad tudes by medical school characteristics. When probed about financial issues, 65% of deans agreed with the viewpoint that \"it is appropriate for state and federal governments to preferentially support primary care faculty and pri\u00ad marycare education,\" while 77% agreed that primary care departments and divi\u00ad sions need financial support from the medical school to survive. Deans of pub\u00ad lic and non-research-intensive institu\u00ad tions were more likely to agree with the former statement (p < .01, P = .02, respectively), while deans of public medical schools were more likely to agree with the latter one (p < .OI). Deans of public institutions were more likely to agree that research was equally important for primary care departments and divisions (p < .01). Otherwise, there were no significant differences in level of agreement by medical school characteristics. Deans' Evaluation of the Primary Care Disciplines The deans' evaluations of primary care faculty, programs, and financial re\u00ad sources are shown in Table 3. They rated faculty in divisions of general pe\u00ad diatrics and general internal medicine higher than, and family medicine fac\u00ad ulty equal to, nonprimary care clinical faculty on their clinical expertise and productivity. They judged the faculty's teaching skills in all three primary care disciplines superior to those of nonpri\u00ad mary care clinical faculty. Faculty in general pediatrics and general internal medicine were rated higher than spe\u00ad cialists on educational productivity, whereas family medicine faculty were rated equal to. The deans viewed the research skills and productivity less fa\u00ad vorablyfor general pediatrics and family medicine faculty compared with non\u00ad .generalists. Faculty in general internal medicine were considered equivalent in their research skills, but were rated lowerfor their faculty's research produc\u00ad tivity.

Among the educational programs, medical student teaching and residency programs received superior ratings for each primary care discipline. The rat\u00ad ings for the fellowship programs varied, with family medicine fellowships viewed less positively than, general pe\u00ad diatrics fellowships equal to, and general internal medicine more favorably than the norm for the nonprimary care clin\u00ad ical disciplines. All three generalist disciplines were rated lower than were the nonprimary care disciplines with respect to their level of research revenues. Deans judged clinical revenues to be lower for family medicine and general pediatrics, and equivalent for general internal medicine, compared with the other clinical disci\u00ad plines.However, the deans consideredthe overall financial resources (which in\u00ad cluded institutional support) to be equiv\u00ad alent for generalist and nongeneralist departments and divisions alike. Deans rated general internal medi\u00ad cine and general pediatrics higher than family medicine on a summative mea\u00ad sure for all 12 areas (p < .COl). They ranked general internal medicine signif\u00ad icantly higher than family medicine in nine of 12 areas, rating the two disci\u00ad plines to be equivalent for faculty teach\u00ad ing skills, quality of medical student teaching, and overall financial re\u00ad sources. The deans rated general pediat\u00ad rics higher than family medicine for eight of 12 areas, rating faculty educa\u00ad tional skills and productivity, the qual\u00ad ity of medical student education, and overall financial resourcesequally. They rated general internal medicine higher than general pediatrics in two areas: faculty clinical expertise and level of research revenues. Public versus private status did not playa significant role in the deans' eval\u00ad uations of the ~rimary \u00a2are disciplines. Deans of institutions rated the quality of family medicine resi\u00ad dency training lower (mean 33 versus 4.l) and fellowships lower (mean 2.5 ver\u00ad sus 3.6) than did deans of non-research\u00ad intensive institutions (p < .01 for both). Measures to Strengthen Primary Care Departments and Divisions Most deans reported their schools at\u00ad tempted to strengthen primary care de\u00ad partments and divisions by changing the curriculum to promote primary care. To this end, they established required third-year clerkships in primary care, increased medical students' training in ambulatory care settings, and added cur\u00ad riculum time for primary care in the undergraduate years (see Table 4). Three-quarters of medical schools placed a major emphasis on financially supporting primary care departments and divisions and faculty as a means to strengthen primary care at their lnstitu- ACADEMIC MEDICINE.

Fewer focused on administrative or policy changes such as upgrading the administrative status of primary care de\u00ad partments and divisions, strengthening primary care administrative structure at the dean's level (25% of schools placed no emphasis on this method), and facil\u00ad itating cooperation among primary care departments and divisions. There were no major differences by medical schools' characteristics. DISCUSSION In their responses in our national study. medical school deans had a moderately positive assessment of their primary care departments and divisions, but they identified weaknesses that ought to be of concern to medical educators, policy\u00ad makers, and the general public. Our results indicate that two ?f the weak\u00ad nesses previously identified in academic generalism (Le., inadequate scholarly output and financial vulnerability') continue to exist. Furthermore, as re\u00ad ported in the past, deans had mixed viewsregarding the level of institutional influence and prestige of academic pri\u00ad mary care departments and divisions. The limited role of primary care faculty in medical education that had been pre\u00ad viously reported appears no longer to be the case. Limited research has been a problem for academic primary care departments and divisions since their establishment in the 1960s and 1970s.3 That this prob\u00ad lem persists is evident in the deans' negative evaluations of primary care faculty's research skills and productivity as well as the level of research revenues of generalist units. Yet, most deans in our study stated that research was im\u00ad portant for primary care faculty. Several factors, including too few qualified ap\u00ad plicants for physician-investigator posi\u00ad tions and insufficient faculty time and financial support for research, have been shown to negatively affect research in 31J 15 primary care -and the health of clinical research in general.'? Because inadequate scholarship, whether real or perceived, continues to plague academic primary care, medical school and teach\u00ad ing hospital leaders should undertake efforts to further understand the causes and institute remedies. Although deans viewed primary care departments and divisions to be finan\u00ad cially vulnerable in their ability to gen\u00ad erate income, they believed their over\u00ad all financial resources were equivalent to other clinical departments. This par\u00ad ity appears to be achieved by a combi\u00ad nation of institutional financial support and preferential policies by governmen\u00ad tal agencies, strategies with which the majority of deans agreed. The impact of governmental support has been note\u00ad worthy. Title VII funding of the Public Health Service Act has been associated with the growth of the family medicine physician workforce as well as higher rates of practice in underserved ar\u00ad eas,17,18 and 86 family medicine pro\u00ad grams received Title VII funding in 2002. 19 An ongoing question is whether this support will continue given con\u00ad cerns raised over potential cuts in Title VII funding. Negative attitudes towards primary care in academic health centers have been described previously.2o The level of institutional influence and prestige of generalist departments or divisions in our study was mixed, at best. with deans evenly divided on whether primary care faculty and departments or divisions ex\u00ad erted sufficient influence on medical schools' policies. Many deans indicated the need for additional primary care role models and recognized that generalist faculty were not held in high esteem by other medical school faculty. The role of primary care faculty in medical education appears to be less of an issue than in the past, as we found one-quarter of the preclinical and more than one-third of the clinical curricu- ACADEMIC MEDICINE, VOL. 79. No. II/NOVEMBER Z004 1100 lum, on average, being taught by pri\u00ad mary care faculty. Deans reported very positive assessments of the educational skills, productivity, and programs of the generalist faculty. The deans' positive assessment of role of generalist faculty in teaching students is encouraging given their desire to emphasize primary care in medical school curricula21 and the fact that increased exposure to generalist fac\u00ad ulty has been associated with students choosing primary care careers. \".5 Our findings regarding the deans' evaluation of and attitudes towards ac\u00ad ademic primary care faculty are gener\u00ad ally concordant with those reported by Block et al. in 1996.20 In their study of . primary care in academia, 90% of deans rated primary care teaching as good as or better than teaching in other disci\u00ad plines, but only 37% considered primary care research to be as good as or better than research performed in other disciplines. Most medical schools have formally organized generalist departments or di\u00ad visions. The presence of a department of family medicine has been shown to pos\u00ad itively influence primary care career choice among medical students.l In our study, 92% of the schools had a family medicine department. Fulfillment of the deans' desire to increase collaboration and integration of services among the primary care disciplines would likely im\u00ad prove the impact primary care depart\u00ad ments have on curricula, research, and leadership within their institutions.22,23 Given the limited resources available to generalist departments and divisions, encouraging an interdisciplinary ap\u00ad proach beyond the existing amount of coordination and integration described by most deans in our study may promote primary care and its impact in academic health centers. In our study, deans reported that their schools had attempted to strengthen their primary care departments and di\u00ad visions by placing major emphases on improving training in primary care and providing financial support for general\u00adist departments and divisions. These ef\u00ad forts are concordant with recommenda\u00ad tions made by an AAMC-sponsored advisory panel on methods to sustain the development of primary care in ac\u00ad ademic medtcine.i\" They include med\u00ad ical school efforts to adopt curricula centering on generalist competencies and assuring adequate financial support for the generalist education of medical students. Our study is potentially limited by self-reported data; however, self-report is appropriate in a study of deans' atti\u00ad tudes and perceptions of the state of primary care at their institutions and nationally. A potential response bias also exists because deans were aware that the study focused on issuesrelevant to academic primary care. The effect of this bias was likely limited, however, a fact exemplified by the deans' unfavor\u00ad able evaluations of a number of features of academic primary care, including its research, institutional influence and prestige, and finances. The deans, on average, gave higher evaluation scores to general internal medicine compared with general pediatrics and family med\u00ad icine, perhaps reflecting, in part, the high percentage of deans trained as in\u00ad ternists and the few with general pedi\u00ad atrics or family medicine backgrounds, However, when adjusting for the deans' professional background, no differences were found {data not shown}. Finally, because we used mostly close-ended questions, we were able only to assess the utilization of measures to strengthen academic primary care that we had identified a priori. Thus, we are unaware of unique measures used at specific in\u00ad stitutions, In summary, medical school deans have a generally positive attitude to\u00ad ward and assessment of academic pri\u00ad mary care and believe that primary care faculty at academic health centers are central to the development of the future primary care-workforce. Nationally, prl\u00ad mary care departments and divisions re\u00ad main dependent on a combination of institutional, state, and federal support to accomplish their academic mission. Preserving this support, particularly the Title VII budget, is essential. Institu\u00ad tions and policymakers need to study additional interventions that will main\u00ad tain primary care educational efforts and improve the financial status and research activities of their primary care faculties.

Teaching and Learning Moment PERSPECfIVE As the coordinator and trainer for the University of Louisville's Standardized Patient (SP) Program, I am responsible for ensuring that all of our SP encounters produce reliable, valid outcomes, both for students on our main campus in Louisville and for those at our rural campus in Madisonville, Kentucky. Our most recent trip to Madisonville occurred the day before Thanksgiving. The entire university closed at noon for the holiday and everyone eagerly left work to begin their holiday weekend-everyone, that is, except four standardized patients and me. We climbed into a van and headed to the Madisonville campus, two very long hours away from home, with nothing to look forward to but wet roads, insane holiday traffic, and miles and miles of damp countryside. Once in Madisonville, I got involved with the students, although my thoughts kept drifting back to Louisville and wishing to already be home with my family. During a break in the schedule, a fourth-year medical student recognized me and stopped to talk. He told me that he would never forget a pediatric SP case that I had coordinated last year. He went on to say that during a visiting pediatric rotation in Nebraska, he had seen a toddler who presented with respiratory problems. This child was not responding to treatments, yet nothing abnormal had shown up on x-rays. Remembering the pediatric SP case, he suggested that the doctor try a flexible bronchoscope to see if the child had aspirated a foreign object. With skepticism, the physician finally agreed to the procedure, which produced a cocklebur from one of the child's lungs. In that moment, my mood changed dramatically. Hearing his story validated my work and my missed holiday time with my family. My work, and at times sacrifices,had made an impact in this student's life. Most importantly, because of this student, a little girl in Nebraska is breathing much easier. Now, that's a new perspective. JACKIE L.

Currently, injection drug use is the major risk factor for HIV. As Russia's alcohol consumption per capita is among the highest in theworld, alcohol-associated behaviours may be an important contributor to the HIV epidemic. Our objective was to examine the prevalence of HIV infection among drug- and alcohol-dependent patients in a regional narcology hospital and in the general population in Leningrad. Methods All patients in the Narcology Hospital, Leningrad Regional Center of Addictions (LRCA), were testedfor HIV antibody between 1997 and 2001. We reviewed these clinical records (i.e. serostatus, gender,age, and addiction) and data from the HIV/AIDS Center in the Leningrad Region (1997-2001). Results From 1997 to 2001, HIV prevalence at the LRCA increased from 0 to 12.7% overall, 33.4% amongdrug-dependent patients and 1.2% among alcohol-dependent patients. During the same 5-yearperiod (1997-2001), 2826 persons were registered at the HIV/AIDS Center: 6, 6, 51, 780, and 1983persons in 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively. Conclusions HIV infection is exploding in the Leningrad Region, currently in injection drug users (IDUs) butpotentially more broadly. The known high per capita alcohol intake in Russia heightens concernregarding the sexual transmission of HIV. Interventions to prevent such a development shouldinclude use, and assessment of the effectiveness, of known HIV prevention measures for at-risk andinfected individuals. Keywords: AIDS, alcohol and drug dependence, HIV, HIV prevalence, Russia Received: 6 March 2003, accepted 23 July 2003 Introduction Reports of HIV infection in Russia have increased dramatically over the past 5 years, with an estimated300 000 HIV-infected persons in 2000 compared to 130000 in 1999 [1]. According to forecasts, in 5 years theremay be approximately 5 million HIV-infected individualsin the Russian Federation. The HIV epidemic in Russia, while perhaps initiated through sexual transmission from foreigners [2], has primarily affected the injection drug user (IDU) population [3,4]. There is concern that the HIVepidemic may expand into the general population, via sexualtransmission. Experts fear that this 'second wave' ofinfections spread through sexual contact could transitionthe current drug-driven epidemic into a generalized one [5]. Injection drug use is an unequivocal major risk factor for HIV transmission. There is some evidence for an indirect role of alcohol use in HIV transmission through modula- tion of sexual or injection drug use-associated risk Correspondence: Dr Jeffrey H. Samet, Section of General Internal Medicine, Clinical Addiction Research and Education (CARE) Unit, 91 East Concord St., Suite 200, Boston Medical Center, Boston, MA 02118, USA. Tel: (617) 4147399; HIV Association 30behaviour [6-9]. Specically, studies have shown an association between alcohol use and unsafe sex behaviour.Stall et al. found, in a cohort of gay men in San Francisco, that alcohol consumption during sexual activity, at anylevel, was associated with high-risk sexual behaviour [10].Rees et al. reported an increase in higher-risk sexual behaviour with higher levels of alcohol use among a cohort of 354 drug users [11]. Additionally, a study of 196 IDUsshowed that alcohol abusers are more likely to engage inhigh-risk drug use [12]. The impact of alcohol use on high-risk sexual and drug use behaviours in the Russian population is important buthas received limited attention. In Russia, where alcoholconsumption per capita is among the highest in the world [13], HIV infection is undergoing an epidemic spread [4]. In the present study carried out in the Leningrad Region ofRussia, we examined the prevalence of HIV infectionamong drug-dependent and alcohol-dependent inpatientsin a substance abuse treatment facility and diagnosed HIVinfection in the general population. Methods Location The Leningrad Region of Russia surrounds St. Petersburg,located in north-west Russia, bordering Finland andEstonia. The population of this region is approximately1.67 million, of which two-thirds dwell in urban environ-ments and one-third in rural areas [14]. The Leningrad Regional Center of Addictions (LRCA), a 300-bed hospital, is the major referral treatment facility for alcohol- anddrug-dependent individuals in this region. The beds at theLRCA are exclusively for individuals with alcohol or drugdependence as their primary diagnosis. Data collection All individuals who received care at the LRCA between1997 and 2001 were tested for HIV antibody as part of therequired initial assessment. The test used was theimmunofluorescent antibody (IFA) test, and those samplesthat were positive underwent conrmation with westernblot testing. We reviewed the clinical records from theLRCA, and recorded the HIV serostatus of all patientsadmitted during these years. Those patients hospitalized repeatedly within 1 year were only counted once; known HIV-infected patients were not retested if re-admitted insubsequent years. We also collected the following demo-graphic information: gender, age, and primary andsecondary addiction diagnoses. The diagnostic categorieswere drug or alcohol dependence, as assigned by theattending psychiatrist and recorded in the medical record. We specically sought any record of drug abuse orinjection drug use in the hospital record of patientsidentied as HIV-infected and alcohol-dependent as aprimary addiction diagnosis. We also reviewed data from the HIV/AIDS Center in the Leningrad Region for the years 1997-2001. This Center collects surveillance data on all reported cases of HIV fromall hospitals including those who specialize in tuberculosis,infectious disease and narcology as well as and othertesting sites in the Leningrad Region, including the LRCA.The data obtained from the HIV/AIDS Center represent thebest available information about HIV prevalence in theoverall Leningrad Region. The Institutional Review Boards of both the Boston Medical Center, Boston, MA and St. Petersburg Pavlov State Medical University, St Petersburg,Russia, approved this protocol. Statistical analysis The statistical analysis involved calculation of the pre-valence of HIV diagnosis, and exact 95% condence intervals (CIs) for this proportion. In addition, we calculated HIV prevalence stratied by primary addictiondiagnosis. All analyses were carried out using SAS STAT s Software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) [15]. Results Leningrad Regional Center of Addictions (LRCA) During the years 1997-2001, 8056 patients entered theLRCA. The primary diagnosis was drug dependence in30.5% (2460) of cases and alcohol dependence in 69.5%(5595). Heroin was the drug of choice for the vast majorityof drug-dependent patients. No diagnosis was available forone patient. The mean age of patients was 36.0 years; 22.6years [standard deviation (SD) 55.6 years] among drug- dependent patients and 41.8 years (SD 510.6 years) among alcohol-dependent patients. Overall, 10.7% (862/8056) ofpatients were female. Women comprised 12.9% of drug-dependent diagnoses and 9.6% of alcohol-dependentdiagnoses. All patients were tested for HIV antibody. Intotal, 4.8% of patients (387/8056) tested positive for HIVantibody, of which 11.1% were female. HIV prevalencestratied by diagnoses is examined by year of hospitaliza- tion and displayed in Table 1. In 1997 and 1998, no patient, either alcohol- or drug- dependent, was HIV-infected. In 1999, 0.4% of patients(95% CI 50.18-0.91%; seven of 1585) tested HIV antibody positive and all had a primary diagnosis of drugdependence. In 2000, 7.1% of patients (95% CI 56.0-8.3%;HIV onset in Leningrad 31 r2004 British HIV Association HIV Medicine (2004) 5, 30-33136 of 1928) were HIV-infected. In 2001, 12.7% (95% CI511.2-14.2%; 244 of 1921) received a positive HIV antibody test. Between the years 1999 and 2001, the prevalence of HIV infection in drug-dependent patientsincreased dramatically. From 1.4% in 1999, the prevalencejumped by 17% in 2000 and by an additional 15% in 2001.Among alcohol-dependent patients, the rst evidence ofHIV infection was noted in 2000 and increased to 1.2% in2001. Assessment of the hospital records of these HIV-infected alcohol-dependent patients revealed no evidence of past injection drug use. In addition, we found no secondary diagnoses of drug dependence for these patientswith both HIV infection and alcohol dependence. HIV/AIDS Center data During the same 5-year period (1997-2001), 2826 newdiagnoses of HIV infection were registered at the HIV/AIDSCenter in the Leningrad Region: six in 1997, six in 1998, 51in 1999, 780 in 2000, and 1983 in 2001. In 2000, 23.1%were female; the mean age for IDUs ( n5707) was 22.2 years (SD 55.1 years), and that for alcoholics ( n59) was 45.1 years (SD 512.3 years). In 2001, were female; the mean age for IDUs ( n51796) was 22.6 years (SD 55.0 years), and that for alcoholics ( n521) was 41.7 years (SD59.0 years). Table 2 further describes HIV prevalence in the Leningrad Region stratied by primary diagnosis asreported to the AIDS Center. Discussion According to a recent UNAIDS report, HIV incidence inEastern Europe is increasing faster than in any other part of the world [4]. This study is unique in that data on HIV prevalence are reported in a high-risk population prior tothe arrival of the epidemic, at its rst detection, and uponits earliest epidemic spread. The recognition of HIVinfection at such an early stage in an epidemic providesan unusual opportunity to limit its spread.Awareness of an emerging crisis with clear risks for expansion and of proven interventions for prevention and treatment potentially enables the problem to be effectively addressed. HIV infection in Russia, currently spread byinjection drug use, requires all effective efforts to beemployed to minimize further transmission. Underusedmeasures include currently proscribed opioid replacementtherapies (e.g. methadone), extensive outreach and needleexchange programmes, and broad public education.Whether viral transmission from the IDU population to the heterosexual population has occurred extensively is not discernible from the data presented. The early suggestion ofan emergence of HIV infection in the alcohol-dependentpopulation is worthy of close attention. Whether injectiondrug use, sexual transmission, or other transmission riskfactors account for the alcohol-dependent subjects in thisreport with HIV infection is not known. We cannotdenitively exclude the possibility that some misclassica- tion may have occurred among the HIV-infected alcohol- dependent LRCA patients. However, injection drug useseems an unlikely possibility as no evidence of injectiondrug use or any secondary diagnosis of drug dependencewas found in any of these patients. Additionally, thedemographic characteristics of the alcohol- and drug-dependent groups are quite distinctive, with the alcoholicpatients being much older. Concern about a higher likelihood of sexual transmission of HIV among alcohol- dependent persons has been previously raised as a result ofdocumented increased sexual risk behaviours in thispopulation [16,17]. One counterintuitive implication of the observation of the recent onset of HIV infection in Russia is that the Russiaof 2003 has yet to experience the full impact of the ravagesof this untreated disease. As the natural history from initial HIV infection to clinical AIDS is a median of 11 years, Russians are experiencing increasing HIV prevalence butnot, as yet, extensive AIDS morbidity and mortality. This isunlike the past initial observations of HIV infection inmany other parts of the world. This phenomenon couldmislead the policy and political leaders of a countryTable 1 HIV prevalence among hospitalized patients in the Leningrad Regional Center of Addictions in 1997-2001 ( in the Leningrad Region of Russia (1997- 2001) stratied by registered risk behaviour as per the HIV/AIDS Centerof the Leningrad Region YearNumber HIV-infected Drug-dependent Alcohol-dependent Other 1997 4 0 2 1998 4 0 2 1999 48 0 3 2000 707 9 642001 1796 21 16632E Krupitsky et al. r2004 British HIV Association HIV Medicine (2004) 5, 30-33experiencing such a scenario into a serious misconception that the issue does not require urgent attention in the midstof many other serious public health, political, andeconomic issues. The results from the Leningrad Regionprovide a stark message: HIV infection is exploding on tothe scene, currently in IDUs but potentially much more broadly. In the Leningrad Region, HIV testing has been carried out aggressively in medical settings; however, it islikely that those HIV-infected individuals without suchmedical exposure may not become aware of their HIVdiagnosis for years, resulting in substantial underestimatesof the regional prevalence of HIV [18]. This perspectiveunderscores the critical nature of efforts to address HIVprevention. Interventions for the prevention of broad transmission of HIV should include extensive distribution of condoms, sex education in public domains, implementa-tion of harm reduction measures for injection drug users,and a serious assault on binge alcohol use. Russia now faces numerous serious public health perils, including HIV infection and alcohol dependence. Atpresent, the number of HIV-infected, alcohol-dependentpersons is insufcient to determine whether alcohol use will contribute to the HIV epidemic in Russia. The stark increase of HIV infection in drug-dependent persons andits rst occurrence in alcohol-dependent patients arguesfor immediate action with injection drug users and closeobservation of the impact of alcohol on the Russianepidemic. HIV prevention efforts in Russia will be criticalin the years ahead, and interventions among substance-dependent persons in treatment could be one of many important intervention strategies.

Horton, ScD, Renata Urban, BA, Elizabeth Maier, BA, Demian Christiansen, MPH, Jeffrey H. Samet MD, MA, MPH BACKGROUND: Many HIV-infected persons learn about their diagnosis years after initial infection. The extent to whichmissed opportunities for HIV testing occur in medical evalu-ations prior to one's HIV diagnosis is not known. DESIGN: We performed a 10-year retrospective chart review of patients seen at an HIV intake clinic between January 1994and June 2001 who 1) tested positive for HIV during the 12months prior to their presentation at the intake clinic and 2)had at least one encounter recorded in the medical record priorto their HIV-positive status. Data collection included demo-graphics, clinical presentation, and whether HIV testing wasrecommended to the patient or addressed in any way in theclinical note. Prespecified triggers for physicians to recom-mend HIV testing, such as specific patient characteristics,symptoms, and physical findings, were recorded for each visit.Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factorsassociated with missed opportunities for discussion of HIVtesting. Generalized estimating equations were used to accountfor multiple visits per subject. RESULTS: Among the 221 patients meeting eligibility criteria, all had triggers for HIV testing found in an encounter note.Triggers were found in 50% (1,702/3,424) of these 221 patients'medical visits. The median number of visits per patient priorto HIV diagnosis to this single institution was 5; 40% of thesevisits were to either the emergency department or urgent careclinic. HIV was addressed in 27% of visits in which triggerswere identified. The multivariable regression model indicatedthat patients were more likely to have testing addressed inurgent care clinic (39%), sexually transmitted disease clinic(78%), primary care clinics (32%), and during hospitalization(47%), compared to the emergency department (11%), obstet-rics/gynecology (9%), and other specialty clinics (10%)( P < .0001). More recent clinical visits (1997-2001) were more likely to have HIV addressed than earlier visits ( P < .0001). Women were offered testing less often than men ( P = .07). CONCLUSIONS: Missed opportunities for addressing HIV test- ing remain unacceptably high when patients seek medical carein the period before their HIV diagnosis. Despite improvementin recent years, variation by site of care remained important.In particular, the emergency department merits consider- ation for increased resource commitment to facilitate HIVtesting. In order to detect HIV infection prior to advancedimmunosuppression, clinicians must become more aware ofclinical triggers that suggest a patient's increased risk for thisinfection and lower the threshold at which HIV testing isrecommended.

A pproximately 900,000 persons in the United States are infected with HIV, a national prevalence of 0.3%. 1,2 Current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimatessuggest that 30% of these individuals are unaware of theirdiagnosis; as many as 275,000 people are infected with HIVbut do not know it. 3 HIV infection has become a chronic and treatable disease, but in order to benefit from treatments,infected individuals must be tested for the virus and linkedto medical care. This is a challenging goal, as the infectionis often asymptomatic until the onset of opportunistic infec-tions, and without treatment the median time between diag-nosis and the development of clinical AIDS is 9 to 11 years. 4,5 Patients frequently become aware of their HIV serostatus very late in the course of their disease, many years after seroconversion. 6 In two different clinical studies at our institu- tion assessing patients between 1990 and 1991, and againfrom 1994 to 1996, the median CD4 cell count at the timeof presentation for medical care for HIV infection was 300and 280 cells/ \u00b5 l, respectively. 7,8 Although delays do occur between HIV testing and linking to care, 9,10 the greatest delay occurs between initial infection and HIV testing. 7 The value of HIV testing goes beyond enabling medical care forthe infected individual. Some studies have demonstratedthat knowledge of HIV serostatus, particularly when positive,decreases behavior that can result in HIV transmission. 11-13 Over a decade has passed since an early call to action aboutHIV testing was prominently stated, \"the nation's physiciansand other health care providers should assume a muchmore active role in promoting HIV testing.\" 14 In order to assess the clinical response to this call to action, we investigated the extent to which physicians ina variety of care settings within a single urban medicalcenter adopted recommended approaches to HIV testing.We assessed 2 issues among recently tested HIV-infectedpatients: 1) whether prior to HIV diagnosis, clinical oppor-tunities for health providers to recommend HIV testing hadarisen; and 2) the clinician's response regarding HIV testingwhen a clinical opportunity occurred.

The DEU is a weeklyclinic designed for the initial assessment and triage of all nonpregnant patients presenting for primary care (PC) for their HIV infection, regardless of insurance status. 15 Referrals to the DEU come from a wide variety of sources,including inpatient hospital services, hospital outpatientclinics, the emergency department (ED), the urgent careclinic (UCC), community health centers, drug treatmentprograms, HIV testing sites, local correctional institutions,as well as self-referrals. Patients were eligible for this study if they were 18 years or older, had their initial positive HIV test within1 year of their DEU visit, and had received medical care atBoston Medical Center prior to their first positive HIV test.We included clinic visits only after March 1985, when HIVtesting became widely available. 6 Medical care at Boston Medical Center was required as these were the medicalrecords available for review. This study was approved bythe Institutional Review Board of Boston Medical Center. Data Collection We requested medical records of patients who met inclusion criteria based on the DEU clinic's log, whichcontained date of initial HIV-positive test and the hospital'scomputerized records, which listed the dates and sites ofprior clinic visits and hospitalizations. Information abstractedfrom medical records included the following: date of birth, gender, race/ethnicity, homelessness status prior to initial positive HIV test, date of positive HIV test, initial DEUvisit date, total number of visits to Boston Medical Center inthe 10 years prior to the patient's initial positive HIV test,and CD4 cell counts. 16 If 2 initial CD4 counts were available from the first month of HIV-related care, then the meannumber was recorded. If, in the encounter note, a patientwas noted as homeless or living in a shelter, then thepatient was considered homeless. When medical recordswere incomplete (e.g., missing certain volumes of a multi-volume chart), whatever visit data were available wereassessed. Each visit in the 10 years prior to the patient'sinitial positive HIV test, but none earlier than March 1985,was reviewed for patient characteristics or conditionsconsidered as clinical triggers for HIV testing (Table 1).Three of the authors\u2014two medical students (EM, RU) anda medical resident (RL)\u2014performed all chart reviews andTable 1.

JGIM Volume 19, April 2004 351 recorded if the patient had any of the listed characteristics or conditions. Charts were reviewed with a predeterminedlist of clinical conditions. Chart reviewers could list otherconditions that they considered potential triggers for HIVtesting; however, after review with study investigators,greater than 95% of triggers came from the predeterminedlist. The site of the clinical encounter was recorded. Triggers for HIV Testing Triggers were hierarchically categorized based on the level of clinical suspicion for HIV infection associated with eachafter review of the medical literature. 16 For example, injection drug use (IDU) and men having sex with men (MSM) weredefined as category 1 (unequivocable triggers), while home-lessness and alcohol abuse were defined as category 4(borderline triggers). Visits were categorized according to the highest (i.e., most unequivocable) category trigger presentduring that visit. For example, if a visit noted injection druguse, homelessness, lymphadenopathy, and gonorrhea, it wasdefined as a category 1 visit, due to the presence of IDU. Westratified triggers as either unequivocal, strongly suggestible,reasonable, or borderline for triggering HIV testing discussions;categories were identified as 1 to 4, respectively. If a triggerdiagnosis was considered but not made definitively suchas \"tuberculosis versus bronchitis,\" then that was labeledborderline, category 4, even if the differential diagnosisincluded conditions listed in categories 1 to 3. A \"missed opportunity\" for HIV testing was a visit in which HIV was not discussed yet contained at least 1 ofthe patient characteristics defined as \"triggers.\" Visits withphysicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, and dentists werereviewed for the presence of HIV trigger conditions recordedin the clinical note. Although clinician type was not poss-ible to abstract in the chart review, physicians account forthe overwhelming majority of clinical encounters with theexception that nurse and nurse practitioner encounterswere most common in the sexually transmitted disease(STD) clinic. If a visit included 1 or more triggers, then addi-tional information was collected about that visit assessingvisit location, date, and other triggers, as well as whetherHIV testing was considered or recommended to the patient.Examples of the \"HIV considered\" group were notes thatstated \"HIV 4 months ago\" and \"HIV a possibility.\"All potential HIV-associated conditions were recorded andcategorized into the diagnoses in Table 1. Defining Patient Characteristics Prior to medical record review, we explicitly defined several patient characteristics. Alcohol abuse was recordedif \"alcohol abuse\" or \"alcohol withdrawal\" was noted or ifthe patient had a history of alcohol detoxification or wasbeing admitted to alcohol detoxification. If a patient wasrecorded as drinking 12 or more beers or 1 pint of liquor/day, that was also recorded as alcohol abuse. Psychiatricdiagnoses included depression and anxiety in additionto schizophrenia and psychosis. Abnormal Pap smearsincluded histories and/or diagnoses of cervical dysplasia and cervical cancer. Substance abuse was checked if itwas not specified which substances were being abused.Tuberculosis was not recorded if a patient had only a positivePPD in the absence of a positive chest radiograph. Lym-phadenopathy included lymph node biopsy in addition togeneralized and localized lymphadenopathy found on physi- cal exam. Pregnancy included those patients admitted for spontaneous or induced abortion in addition to those thatwere receiving prenatal care or were admitted for delivery.Homelessness was recorded for persons living in sheltersin addition to street dwellers. The time period of the clinicalencounter was divided into 4-year intervals beginning with1985 to 1988 and continuing through 1997 to 2001. Statistical Analysis Simple proportions of patients who had a record of a clinician's recommending or considering HIV infection werecalculated for each of the trigger conditions. We examinedtriggers associated with a provider's missed opportunity toconsider HIV testing using generalized estimating equation(GEE) 17,18 as implemented in SAS PROC GENMOD (SAS In- stitute, Cary, NC). These models accounted for the correlationbetween visits recorded for a given subject. An exchangeableworking correlation matrix was assumed, and an empiricvariance estimator was used to generate standard error esti-mates for the regression parameters. Potential confoundingvariables (gender, age of first diagnosis, race/ethnicity, home-less status, and time period of the clinical encounter) wereincluded in the model, along with visit site and triggercategory. In secondary analyses, the model was also fitexcluding visits from 1985 to 1993, to assess the consistencyof results only using more recent data, and also refit excludingcategory 4 (borderline triggers). We performed additional secondary analyses with 10 selected triggers of particular clinical interest: men havingsex with men, community-acquired pneumonia, hepatitis Band/or C, homelessness, sexually transmitted diseases,weight loss, zoster, injection drug use, cocaine use, andalcohol abuse. For the analyses of the 10 individual triggers,we used an extended GEE model considering whether useof a particular trigger will yield different associations. Thesemethods are similar to fitting separate logistic regressionmodels for each of these specified triggers. A limitation offitting separate models has been the lack of a method fordeciding whether regression coefficients are different in theseparate models, and how to combine results if they arenot. We used new techniques 19-21 to fit models that allow different parameters for the association between trigger andoutcome to appear in each of the equations. Using this model,it is possible to test whether there are different associationsbetween each of these triggers and the outcome. Eachsubject contributes 10 observations to the data set (one foreach trigger) for each visit, with an indicator as to whetherthat trigger was observed for that subject. An exchangeableworking correlation structure was used, with subject as the 352 Liddicoat et al., Missed Opportunities for HIV Testing JGIM clustering variable. For these models, using the previous results for guidance, a parsimonious regression was fit thatdropped race/ethnicity, homelessness status, and used a2 category period variable (1985 to 93 vs 1994 to 2001). RESULTS Between 1994 and 2001, 1,400 patients were seen at the DEU clinic and of those, 358 preliminarily met the study eligibility criteria based on DEU and administrative hospital computerized records: HIV tested in the previous12 months and received prior care at Boston MedicalCenter. Of the eligible 358 patients, medical records of 256(72%) were located by the hospital records department.After review of the individual medical records, 7% (19/256)of patients were excluded because they did not meet 1 ofthe 2 eligibility criteria. Among the 237 remaining patientcharts, we reviewed a total of 3,742 clinic visits. An addi-tional 16 medical records were excluded because they didnot have visits after March 1985, the year that the HIV testbecame widely available. 6 Among the remaining 221 patients' medical records, 5 were incomplete, but the available datawere included in this study. There were 3,424 clinic visitsfor the 221 patients included in the final analyses. All 221 patients had one or more triggers for HIV test- ing found in at least one encounter note. Triggers for HIVtesting were noted in 50% (1,702/ 3,424) of the eligible visits reviewed among the 221 patients . HIV testing was recom- mended to the patient in 18% (299/1,702) of visits in whichtriggers were noted. HIV was considered in the note by theclinician without recommending testing in another 10% ofvisits (169/1,702). In total, HIV testing was recommendedor considered in the provider note in 27% (468/1,702) ofvisits with triggers noted. The median number of visits perpatient with a trigger was 5 (mean 7.7). The median numberof triggers that a patient had per visit was 2.0 (mean 2.1). Demographic characteristics of the 221 patients (Table 2) include the following: 66% male, 49% African-American, 23%immigrants from an HIV endemic country, and 22% home-less. The mean age at the time of a positive HIV test was39 years. In 44% of patients (96/220), the initial CD4 countwas less than 200 cells/ \u00b5 l when diagnosed with HIV. The mean CD4 count was 328 cells/ \u00b5 l, while the median was 256 cells/ \u00b5 l. Only 51% (113/221) of patients had any PC visit in the Boston Medical Center system prior to the dateof their initial positive HIV test. Thirty-nine percent (670) of the clinical visits ( n = 1,702) with HIV triggers were to the ED (370) or UCC (300). Primary care was the second most common clinical site with 18% (306). Hospitalization accounted for 13% (218) of such visits and obstetrics/gynecology 7% (119). Although HIV was addressed in 28% of the 1,702 visits, the percentage of thesevisits varied widely by site (Table 3). While 32% of visits toPC clinic and 39% of visits to UCC addressed HIV, only 12%of ED visits considered HIV infection. The site that mostroutinely considered HIV was STD clinic (78%), followed byhospitalization (47%). Other sites with low percentages foraddressing the issue of HIV testing were other specialists(10%), obstetrics/gynecology (9%), and dermatology (14%). The multivariable model for missed opportunities for recommending testing or considering HIV found that genderwas a borderline significant predictor, with women beingmore likely to have a missed opportunity (odds ratio [OR],1.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.98 to 2.07). Therewas no association between race/ethnicity anddiscussion (degrees of freedom [d.f.], 4; P = .44). Older age at first HIV diagnosis was associated with missed oppor-tunities (OR, 1.26 for each additional decade of age; 95%CI, 1.02 to 1.55), while homelessness ( P = .90) had no sig- nificant association with HIV discussion or testing. The year of the visit had a significant association with addressing HIV, showing that more HIV testing occurredover time (d.f., 3; P < .001). Compared to visits during the periods 1997 to 2001, visits during 1985 to 1988 (OR, 12.0;95% CI, 6.0 to 23.9), 1989 to 1992 (OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 2.4to 5.3), and 1993 to 1996 (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4 to 2.6) hadgreater odds of missed opportunities. Site of visit was alsoa significant predictor of missed opportunities for discus-sion (d.f., 7; P < .0001). Compared to the UCC, visits to the ED (OR, 4.2; 95% CI, 2.6 to 6.7), obstetrics/gynecologyclinic (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1 to 3.6), other specialty clinic(OR, 4.0; 95% CI, 2.3 to 6.9), and surgical clinic (OR, 10.3;95% CI, 2.0 to 53.3) had greater odds of a missed oppor-tunity. Visits to the PC clinic (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.7 to 1.5)were not significantly different from the UCC, while the STDclinic had lower odds of a missed opportunity (OR, 0.07;95% CI, 0.04 to 0.15). Trigger category was significantly associated with missed opportunities for testing (d.f., 3; P < .0001). Table 4 shows the percentage of time that HIV was discussed invisits stratified by trigger category. Compared to category4 (borderline triggers), category 1 had lower odds of missedTable 2.

There were also statisti-cally significant differences in missed opportunities amongtrigger categories 1 to 3. Compared to categories 2 and 3,respectively, category 1 had lower odds of missed oppor-tunities (OR, 0.38, 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.58; OR, 0.18, 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.28). Category 2 had lower odds of missed oppor- tunities than category 3 (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.70). In secondary analyses using only visit data from 1993 to 2001, the results were generally consistent, though womenhad significantly more missed opportunities for HIV testing( P = .01), and the age association was attenuated ( P = .16). Results from the regression model were also similar whenthe category 4 trigger visits were excluded from the analysis. When individual triggers were compared to one another, there was a significant difference between trigger typeand whether HIV testing was recommended or considered(d.f., 9; P = .05), indicating that there were significantdifferences in clinicians' perceptions of the associations between the individual triggers and HIV discussion (whilecontrolling for gender, age, location, and period). To helpillustrate these differences, Table 5 lists the unadjustedpercentage of visits with specific triggers where HIV wasrecommended or considered. Men having sex with men asa trigger was associated with the highest proportion of HIV testing being recommended or considered, 71%. When injection drug use was noted, HIV testing was recommendedor considered 54% of the time. Zoster was the weakest triggerfor HIV testing recommendation or consideration amongthe 10 individually assessed triggers. DISCUSSION More than 2 decades after AIDS was first described, patients continue to present for initial HIV-related medicalcare years after acquiring the virus. Although diagnosis ofHIV infection at an asymptomatic stage is a challenge, it Table 4.

Demographic characteristics of the 221 patients in this study are similar to national averages for HIV-infectedpersons: 66% male and 49% African-American with below 200 cells/ \u00b5 l, similar to 36% found in several other urban centers. 27 Our study found that in less than 1 of 5 encounters with a clinical trigger for HIVinfection, documentation was found in the chart that HIVtesting was recommended to the patient. Clinical documen-tation of \"consideration\" of HIV infection, a less stringentcriterion, occurred in only 28% of encounters. In the caseof category 1 and 2 visits, with triggers such as injectiondrug use, lymphadenopathy, and varicella zoster, testingwas recommended or considered only 52% for category 1and 33% for category 2 visits. A large number of the visits with triggers for HIV testing (39%, 670/1,702) were found in patients presenting to the ED or UCC, while 18% of visits were to PC clinic. Onlyhalf of the 221 patients had even 1 PC visit. This findingindicates that successful early HIV diagnosis in medicalsettings requires outreach beyond the PC clinical arena. The site of the encounter was highly associated with HIV testing's being recommended or considered. Hospitalizedand STD clinic patients had a relatively high level of add-ressing HIV while the ED and obstetrics/gynecology andsurgical clinics had lower levels. Barriers to testing at thesesites may relate to time pressures and absence of a struc-tured system to facilitate testing. The STD clinic routinelyhighlights HIV testing on patient forms as a physicianreminder, while the ED did not have a reminder system ora staff member to encourage HIV testing. However, neitherthe UCC nor PC clinic had a system for HIV testing, yetthe rates of recommending HIV testing, while still poor,were 3 times that of the ED. Several possible explanationsmay account for the discrepancy between testing in the UCC and ED: the level of medical acuity in the UCC is lessthan the ED setting, and ED staff have less training inpreventive medicine as compared to internal medicinephysicians in the UCC. Only 21% of TB clinic patients withtriggers had a documented HIV test recommendation. Con-sidering that 28% to 46% of adults with TB in the United States are HIV infected, 28 21% is a very low percentage. However, the small number of TB clinic encounters ( n = 33) makes conclusions in this setting difficult. Missed opportunities for HIV testing may reflect the lack of adequate HIV services in the clinics and ED. Requir-ing patients to return to an unfamiliar clinical setting likethe ED to receive HIV test results may be more likely toresult in persons not returning for test results. 29 It is also necessary for transient care sites to have effective systemsfor follow-up so that patients who test positive are able toengage in care. 30 Our data indicate that even when triggers for HIV are present, clinicians either do not think of testing or do notdocument the consideration of this diagnosis. Developingsystems whereby patients with selected \"trigger\" conditionspresenting to EDs or other sites with high HIV prevalenceare automatically offered HIV testing independent of theprovider, would increase testing yet not add substantiallyto the burden of the provider. The Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention has recommended that all highprevalence hospitals, those with greater than 1 new diagnosisof HIV per 1,000 inpatients, should implement testingfor all inpatients. Implementation of such recommendationshas yielded enhanced case findings of undiagnosed HIV-infected individuals. 31 Expanding this recommendation to other high-risk clinical sites would enhance testing efforts. In November 2002, the Food and Drug Administration approved OraQuick, a rapid fingerstick test with results in20 minutes (sensitivity of 99.6%, specificity of 100%). 32 Its utility may be particularly valuable in the UCC and EDsetting in which patients are less likely to return for testresults. 29 If instituted in the ED and other high-volume sites, rapid testing might enhance testing and increase linkageto care. 33,34 The lower proportion of testing for females (24%) com- pared to males (31%) has been shown previously. 35 As the HIV epidemic becomes increasingly equally distributedbetween men and women, this past bias in provider riskperception for HIV needs to be eliminated. Another potential barrier to expanded testing is the requirement of informed consent prior to testing. Thisrequires a provider's time, which may decrease testingrecommendation. If broader testing is to be implementedand explicit written informed consent continues to be con-sidered essential prior to testing, then resources to enablethis activity will be necessary. A limitation of our study was dependence on chart review methodology to determine whether HIV testing had beenconsidered or recommended between providers and patients.It is possible that discussions occurred but were notTable 5. Examination by Specific HIV Triggers in Medical Encounters Between 1994 and 2001 Where HIV Testing Was Recommended or Considered by the Clinician HIV Trigger% (Number of visits with HIV testing recommended or considered/total number of visits with triggers) Men sex with men 71 (32/45) Weight loss 68 (54/80) Injection drug use 54 (91/167)Hepatitis B and/or C 50 (51/103)Community acquired pneumonia 50 (66/132)Sexually transmitted disease 46 (100/217)Crack/cocaine 42 (98/235) Alcoholism/alcohol Homelessness 34 (57/167)Herpes Zoster 21 (19/90) JGIM Volume 19, April 2004 355 accurately documented. Another limitation is the need to make explicit and categorize the triggers for HIV testingderived from recently published reports. This is necessarilyan approxi mation and differences of opinion may exist about the categorization of particular characteristics or diagnoses. In addition, category 4 triggers may have beenless broadly appreciated in the earlier years assessed. Another limitation is that these data reflect a single urban northeastern U.S. hospital. Although representative of many clinical settings, generalization of these results may not be applicable to all hospitals. Patients were chosenbased on the existence of documented clinical encoun- ters at the study institution prior to their knowledge ofHIV infection. Some patients may have been ineligible dueto their receiving care at other institutions prior to a pos-itive HIV test. These patients' encounters may have differedfrom study patients. CONCLUSIONS Missed opportunities for earlier HIV testing have been the norm for patients who received medical care prior totheir HIV diagnoses. Recommendation or consideration ofHIV testing was noted in the clinical record in less than athird of such opportunities. Many HIV-infected patientsreceived their medical care prior to HIV diagnosis at tran-sient sites, the emergency department, and urgent careclinic. These data indicate the need to initiate expansiveHIV testing in transient sites with high volumes of HIV-infected individuals. It should be the responsibility ofproviders in all clinical sites to ensure that opportunitiesto address HIV testing are not missed.

ABSTRACT Aim Weexamined the association of substance abuse treatment with uptake. adherence and virological response to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) among HN-infected people with a history of alcohol problems. Design Prospective cohort study. Methods A standardized questionnaire was administered to 349 HN-infected participants with a history of alcohol problems regarding demographics. sub\u00ad stance use. use of substance abuse treatment and uptake of and adherence to HAART. These subjects were followed every 6 months for up to seven occasions. We defined substance abuse treatment services as any of the following in the past 6 months: 12 weeks in a half-way house or residential facility; 12 visits to a substance abuse counselor or mental health professional; or participation in any methadone maintenance program. Our outcome variables were uptake of antiretroviral therapy. 30-day self-reported adherence and mv viral load suppression. Findings At baseline, 59% (205/349) of subjects were receiving HAART. Engagement in substance abuse treatment was independently associated with receiving antiretroviral therapy (adjusted OR;95% C1: 1.70; 1.03-2.83). Sub\u00ad stance abuse treatment was not associated with 30-day adherence or HN viral load suppression. More depressive symptoms (0.48; 0.32-0.78) and use of drugs or alcohol in the previous 30 days (0.17: O.U-o.28) were associated with worse 3O-day adherence. HIVviral load suppression was positively asso\u00ad ciated with higher doses of antlretrovlral medication (1.29; 1.15-1.45) and older age (1.04; 1.00-1.07) and negatively associated with use of drugs or alco\u00ad hol in the previous 30 days (0.51; 0.33-0.78). Conclusion Substance abuse treatment was associated with receipt of HAART; however. it was not associated with adherence or HN viral load sup\u00ad pression. Substance abuse treatment programs may provide an opportunity for Hlv-Infected people with alcohol or drug problems to openly address issues of mv care including enhancing adherence to HAAR1: KEYWORDS Access. adherence, alcohol, antiretroviraI therapy, HN, sub\u00ad stance abuse treatment. substance use.

INTRODUCTION Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has led to significant reductions in morbidity and mortality as well ascnhanced quality of lifefor many HIV-infectedindivid\u00ad et al. 1999). Certain HIV\u00ad infected subgroups. such as substance users, appear to have a lower uptake of antiretroviral therapy compared to other HIV-positive people in Canada, the United States and Europe (Celentano et al. 1998; Strathdee et al. 1998; al. 1999; Lucas etal. 2001). Among eligibleHlV-infected injection drug users in Vancouver and Baltimore only 40 and 51 'Yo, respec\u00ad tively, reported receiving antiretroviral therapy. These studies found that not being enrolled in an addiction treatment program was associated with failure to receive medications (Celentano et aI. 1998; Strathdee et al. 1998). In addition, ongoing drug use lowered the likeli\u00ad hood of antiretroviral prescription among HIV-infected drug users who had regular access to AIDS specialized hospital care (Carrlerl et al. 1999; Stein et al.2000; Lucas et al. 2001). Conversely, studies have found participation in methadone maintenance increased use of HAARTand may reinforce adherence to medical recommendations (Sambamoorthi et al. 2000; Moreno etal. 2001). Ongoing drug use appears to be associated with poorer adherence. Lucas et aI. found that active illicit drug users had inferior self-reported adherence to HAART resulting in poorer virological and immunologi\u00ad cal outcomes. compared to former and non-drug users (Lucas etal. 2001). Among Hlv-Infected drug users in methadone maintenance, ongoing illicit drug injection was the only factor significantly associated with multiple measures of antiretroviral therapy non-adherence (Stein etaI. 2000). Moreover, HlV-infected opioid users in buprenorphine maintenance treatment achieved higher levels of adherence than drug users not in treatment (Moatti et al. 20(0). These data suggest that substance abuse treatment services may bekeyto optimizing anti\u00ad retroviral adherence among drug users. Despite the findings that alcohol problems are com\u00ad monly fewdata are available regarding the role of substance abuse treatment services for HlV-infected people with alcohol problems. Alcohol is a risk factor for poorer medication adherence; in the HIV Cost and Utilization of Services Study, both peoplewith heavy alcohol and druguscwerelesslikelyto achieve 100% 7-day adherence to antiretroviral therapy (Galvan etal. 2002). In this study it was hypothesized that engagement in substance abuse treatment services would improve the uptake of antlretroviral therapy. adherence and HIV viral load suppression in a cohort of HIV-infededpeoplewith alcoholproblems. We examined C> 2004 Society for the Study of Addiction these issues among participants in the HIV-Alcohol Lon\u00ad gitudinal Cohort (HlV-ALe) study. which includes HlV\u00ad infected people with a history of alcohol problems. METHODS Study design We analyzed data from a prospective cohort of HIV\u00ad infected patients with a history of alcohol problems. One hundred and fifty-one subjects in the cohort participated in a randomtzed controlled trial of a HAART adherence intervention (ADHERE study); appropriate adjustments were made to the analysis to account for the trial (Samet eta1. 2002). Study population Patients who wcre HIV-infectedand had a history of alco\u00ad hol problems were identifiedbyexpliciteligibilitycriteria. All potential subjects who gave two or more positive responses to the CAGE (Cut-down, Annoyed, Guilt, Eye\u00ad opener) questionnaire recruited fromthe BostonMedicalCenterHlVDiagnostic Evaluation Unit (DEU) (Samet et al. 1995) who did not meet CAGE criteria, were eligible if one of two attending physicians made a specificdiagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence. Thus subjects with alcohol problems. despite not beingdetected bythe CAGE,weredetectedbytheclin\u00ad ical interview and recruited. However. within the DEU site most subjects were recruited based on CAGE criteria. Other entry criteria included the following: fluency in English or Spanish; Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score greater or equal to 21 (Folstein etal, 1975); and no plans to move from the Boston area in the next 2 years. As chronic alcohol use is associated with cognitive impairment, we usedthe MMSEcut-offof 21 to excludesubjectsinwhom suchimpairment maypreclude obtaining informed. consent, an accurate and complete interviewer-administered questionnaire or a follow-up interview. The Institutional Review Boards of Boston MedicalCenter andBethIsrael DeaconessMedicalCenter approved this study. From July 1997 to July 2001, recruitment of sub\u00ad jects occurred by multiple methods and from several sites: Boston Medical Center HIV Diagnostic Evaluation Unit (56%); posted flyers (17%); Boston Medical Center Primary Care Clinic (13 'Yo): respite facility for homeless people (5%); methadone clinic (4%); subject referrals (4%); and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (2%). The majority of subjects was recruited from medical set\u00ad Ad&cUon.99.361-368 Substance abuse treatment andadherence to HAART 363 tings that addressed HIV-related issues. The eligibility criteria of a history of alcohol problems was deter\u00ad mined by the CAGE questionnaire in 313/349 (90%) of subjects, and based on clinical assessment in 36/349 (10%) of subjects. Diagnostic interviews for alcohol problems In a sample of these subjects (n: 141) revealed an 80% life-time history of alcohol etaI. 2004). Data collection Afterobtaining informed consent. a research associate or study investigator interviewed subjects using a standard\u00ad izedinstrument to ascertain baseline Information includ\u00ad ing the following: demographics, mv risk behaviors. alcohol severity. use of substance abuse treatment ser\u00ad vices and health care utilization in the preceding 6 months. For the Spanish interview standardized scales in Spanish were used when available: the remainder of the questionnaire was translated from English into Spanish, back-translated to check for accuracy. and then cor\u00ad rected. We attempted to obtain CD4cellcountsand mv RNA (Viral load) levels on all subjects. Laboratory tests performed within 6 months of the interview as part of clinical care were recorded. If not available through rou\u00ad tine clinical care. blood samples were obtained and tested forCD4cell countand mvRNAusing the BostonMedi\u00ad cal Center Clinical Laboratory. Subjects were followed every 6 months for up to seven observations and follow\u00ad up ended in July 2001. Outcome variables Uptake of anttretroviral therapy was defined as cur\u00ad rently being on antlretroviral therapy at the time of the first interview. Patients reported the names of their anti\u00ad retroviral medications. as well as the number of doses and the total number of pills prescribed daily. We defined 30-day self-reported adherence as a dichoto\u00ad mous variable and calculated 11 as the ratio of pills taken over pills prescribed and dichotomized the vari\u00ad able where patients less than 95% adherent were considered non-adherent (Paterson et al. 2000). Mea\u00ad surement of HIV viral load was performed using branched-chain DNA (bONA) techniques (Pachl et aI. 1995). The lower threshold for detection at the time of the study was 50 copies/ml. There is a variability of 0.3 log (three- to fivefold) in the assay itself. meaning that the difference between sequential values must exceed this difference to be considered clinically significant in an individual patient (Carpenter etal. 2(00). We defined HIV viral load suppression as achieving IllV RNA of less than 500 copies/mI. (;) 2004 Society for the Study of Addiction Primary independent variable Wedefined substance abusetreatment services as any of the followinginthe past 6 months:atleast 12 weeksin a half-way house or residential facility; at least 12 visits to a substance abuse counselor or mental health profes\u00ad sional; day treatment for at least 30 days; or participation in any methadone maintenance program (Brands et al. 2002; Farre eta1. 2002). Other independent variables Other specific variables assessed included: age; gender; depressivesymptoms as measured by the 20-item Centers forEpidemiologic Studies Depression Scale(CFB-D) where ~ 16 denotes depressive symptoms (Andresen et al. 1994); self-reported use of alcohol or drugs in the previ\u00ad ous 30 days; severity of alcohol dependence as measured by the Alcohol Dependence Scale (ADS) (Ross et al. 1990); homelessness, which was defined as having spent at least 1 night either on the street or in a shelter in the 6 months prior to the Interview (Kertesz et al. 2003); number of doses of antiretroviral medication per day; CD4 cell count and social support. We measured social support by the PerceivedSocial Support instrument that has a subscale that assesses general support from friends (Proctdano & Heller 1983). Analysis We used multivariable logistic regression to examine the association of substance abuse treatment on uptake of antiretroviral therapy at baseline and we adjusted for potential confounding factors by including in the model gender. race, severity of alcohol dependence. homeless\u00ad ness and recent drug injection variables. Multivariable longitudinal logisticregression models were constructed to examine the association of substance abuse treatment on adherence and mV-RNA (viral load) suppression over time. Because serial measures on the same individuals were considered for the medication adherence and viral load suppression analyses. generalized estimating equa\u00ad tions were used to adjust for correlation-between these measures over time using a working independence corre\u00ad lation matrix (Liang & Zeger 1986; Zeger& Liang 1986). The substance abuse treatment variable was dichoto\u00ad mous. Two separate models were fitted for 30-day and mvviralload suppression outcomes.

RESULTS The 349 subjects the following baseline characteris\u00ad tics: 79% were men; two-thirds were ethnic minorities; mean age was 41 years; and 29% were homeless. The most common mv risk factor W\"dS injection drug use (59%). with men having sex with men and heterosexual sex each stated by 20% of the non-injecting subjects. Of the injection drug users. 23% had injected drugs in the previous 6 months. In the past 30 days. 24% of subjects reported using alcohol and heroin or cocaine, 18% used alcohol alone and 5% used heroin or cocaine alone; 12% were enrolled in a methadone maintenance program. The average daily alcohol consumption of those drinking in the past 30 days was 6.4 drinks. Over one-third (118/ 349) of the subjects were engaged in substance abuse treatment at the initial observation. Among the subjects who werenot engaged in substance abuse treatment at the initial observation, 70 subjects entered substance abuse treatment during the study period. In terms of primary medical care, 92% (323/349) of the subjects saw a phy\u00ad sician twoor more times in the preceding 6 months. In this research study, the subjects were followedevery 6 months forup to sevenoccasions and the median number of obser\u00ad vations per subject was three. The distribution of inter\u00ad views(observations) conducted per subject was as follows: III subjects had one interview; 40 had two interviews; 48 had three interviews; 44 had four interviews; 39 had five interviews; 47 had six interviews and 20 completed seven interviews. Because study subjects were recruited over a 4-year period. and all follow-ups ceased soon after the end of that recruitment. time of recruitment was the major factor affecting the number of follow-up observa\u00ad tions in this study (Ehrenstein eta1. 2004). The characteristics of the 205 participants receiving antiretroviral therapy are presented in Table 1. Factors associated with HAART receipt in the bivariate analysis were: not being homeless (22.4% versus 38.2%. P = 0.001); and having lower ADS scores (6.9 .versus 10.0. P = 0.006). In the multivariable model. the follow\u00ad ing factors were independently associated with receiving antiretroviral therapy (Adjusted OR;95% CI):use of sub\u00ad stance abuse treatment services versus none (1.70; 1.03-2.83) and not being homeless (2.27; 1.34-3.79). The participant characteristics for 3Q-day adherence are presented in Table 2. In the multivariate adherence model (Table3). we found that substance abuse treat\u00ad ment was not associated with 30-day adherence. Depres\u00ad sive symptoms (0.48; 0.32-0.78) and use of drugs or alcohol in the previous 30 days (0.17; 0.11-0.28) were negatively associated with adherence. Factors positively associated with HIV viral load suppression Included higher average number of daily doses of antiretroviral medication (1.29; 1.15-1.45) and older age (1.04; 1.O<}\u00ad 1.07). whereas use of alcohol and drugs in the previous 30 days was negatively associated with HIV viral load suppression (0.53; 0.35-0.82) (Table 3). A subanalysis was undertaken to explore whether the absence of a substance abuse treatment effect on adher\u00ad ence was because treatment did not impact on alcohol and drug use. This hypothesis was not borne out and we found that participants in substance abuse treatment had Table I Bivariate and multivariate associations of characteristics of HIV-infected subjects with alcoholproblems receiving and not receiving antiretroviral therapy.

Thus, despite the effectivenessof substance abuse treatment on substance use, this exposure did not yield a medication adherence benefit. DISCUSSION In this cohort of HIV-infected people with alcohol prob\u00ad lems, engagement in substance abuse treatment services and not being homeless were associated with current (;) 2004 Society for the Study of Addiction receipt of antiretroviral therapy. Wedid notfind,however. that engagement of substance abuse treatment services over time had a significant effect on adherence or HIV viral suppression. Consistent with previous literature, the use of drugs or alcohol in the previous 30 days and the presence of depressive symptoms were each negatively associated with self-reported HAART adherence. Numerous studies have also found thatactivedrug use and not being engaged in addiction treatment was asso\u00ad ciated with a lower likelihood of receiving antiretroviral treatment (Strathdee et al. 1998; Bassetti et al. 1999; Moatti et al. 2000; Celentano et aI. 2001; Lucas et al. Addiction. 99. 361-368 366 Anita Palepu et al. 2001). Conversely, consistent participation in methadone maintenance therapy among Hlv-lnfected opiate users was associated with a higher probability of antiretroviral usc (Celentano et al. 2001; Turner et aI. 2(01). The asso\u00ad ciation of substance abuse treatment and increased HAART uptake may be due to the willingness of physi\u00ad cians to prescribe HAART to patients whom they believe may be more adherent to medications. or it may be that patients engaged in substance abuse treatment may be more willing to accept HAART. Other studies have also found that homelessness and unstable housing are asso\u00ad ciated with less access to HAART(Bangsberg et al. 1997; Friedland & Williams 1999; Bamberger et al. 2000). Although active drug and alcohol use has been cited as a barrier to achieving optimal adherence to antiretrovi\u00ad rals and mv viral load suppression (Palepu et al. 2003). there are few studies that have addressed the effect of addiction treatment on adherence and Virological out\u00ad comes. In a longitudinal study of Hlv-infected patients attending an urban clinic, Lucas et al. found that those who switched from non-use to substance use had worse HAART uptake and adherence. less frequent mv viral load suppression and lower (,'))4cell increases compared to those who remained free of substance use. Conversely, switching from substance use to non-use was strongly associated with improvements in antiretroviral therapy use and adherence. and HIV-1treatment outcomes. com\u00ad pared to persisting with substance use (Lucas etal.2(02). One study found that buprenorphine drug maintenance treatment increased adherence to antiretroviral therapy among Hlv-lnfected drug users (Moatti etaI. 2000). Among participants in a methadone maintenance pro\u00ad gram, ongoing illicit injection drug use W'dS associated with non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy but it was not associated with undetectable HIV viral load (Stein etal. 2000). Turner et al. found recently that among drug-using men enrolled in the New York State Medicaid program, regular drug treatment (defined as at least 6 months duration) was positively associated with a phar\u00ad macy-based measure of adherence, but this finding was not observed for women drug users (Turner et al. 2003). In thlsIongltudlnal cohort, engagement in substance abuse treatment did not translate to superior HAART adherence or mvviral suppression. To explain this find\u00ad ing, we tested the hypothesis that the substance abuse treatment services were ineffective at reducing substance usc. We found that substance abuse treatment was asso\u00ad ciated with lower odds of use of alcohol and drugs in the previous 30 days. A possible explanation for not observ\u00ad ing an association between substance abuse treatment and adherence may be the lack of integration of mycare and addiction treatment. A recent study found that almost half of a cohort of Hlv-infected drug users, iden\u00ad tifiedthroughNewYork StateMedicaidfilesto be on.ann-. I:> 2004 Society for the Study of Addiction retroviral therapy. did not have regular mv viral load testing. The authors concluded that drug users with HIY\u00ad focused care or with regular drug treatment were more likely to have regular HIV viral load testing (Laine etol. 2002). The implications of their work as well as our results are that primary care including HIV-focusedcare and substance abuse treatment may need to be better integrated inorderforpatientstoderivethe fullbenefitsof HAART. given that both HIV and addiction arc chronic diseases. Our study has limitations. Although our definition of substance abuse treatment services is not as stringent as that used by Laine et al. (2001), we think it has face valid\u00ad ity. In our cohort of patients. 36% were categorized as receiving substance abuse treatment services at a reason\u00ad able levelof exposure. although higher levelsof exposure to substance abuse treatment may be required to demon\u00ad strate an effect. We were unable to distinguish between current and recent (i.e, within the past 6 months) sub\u00ad stance abuse treatment. Our adherence measure is by self-report and tends to over-estimate adherence com\u00ad pared to medication event monitoring systems. However, both measures are strongly correlated and a strong rela\u00ad tionship exists between self-reported adherence and HIV\u00ad RNAamong drug users (Arnsten et a1. 2001). Finally,we did not have nadir CD4 cell counts values to include in our analyses. In summary, we found that being engaged in sub\u00ad stance abuse treatment is associated with fIIV-related medical care among HIV-infected people with alcohol problems. Specifically, substance abuse treatment is asso\u00ad ciated with current receipt of antiretroviral therapy. However. engagement of substance abuse treatment ser\u00ad vices over time did not have a significant effect on adher\u00ad ence to antiretroviral medications. Uptake of HMRT may be enhanced by effective interactions between the patient and the medical system. Improvements in adher\u00ad ence to l:IAART are not as yet evident by exposure to sub\u00ad stance abuse treatment. Nonetheless, efforts to maximize the effect of substance abuse treatment on adherence to antiretrovirals and HIVtreatment outcomes among my\u00ad infected people with alcohol and drug problems merit fur\u00ad ther examination in clinical trials (Stone 2001; Animas\u00ad 2002; Bartlett 2002; Ickovics & Meade 2002; Tuldra & Wu 2002). In the meantime. substance abuse treatment programs may provide an opportunity to address openly issues of mvcare. including enhancing adherence to HAART.

Peterson, MD, MSc, Robert H. Friedman, MD, Arlene S, Ash, PhD, Shakira Franco, MS, Phyllis L Carr, MD BACKGROUND: Despite the need to recruit and retain minority faculty in academic medicine. little is known about the experi\u00ad ences ofminority faculty. in particular their self-reported experi\u00ad ence of racial and ethnic discrimination at their institutions, OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of self-reported experience of racial/ethnic discrimination among faculty of U.S. medical schools, as well as associations with outcomes, such as career satisfaction, academic rank, and number of peer-reviewed publications. DESIGN: A 177-item self-administered mailed survey of U.S. medical school faculty. SE1TING: Twenty-four randomly selected medical schools in the contiguous United States. PARTICIPANTS: Arandom sample of 1.979 full-time faculty, strati\u00ad fied by medical school, specialty, graduation cohort, and gender. MEASUREMENTS: Frequency of self-reported experiences of racial/ethnic bias and discrimination. RESULTS: The response rate was 60%. Of 1,833 faculty eligible, 82% were non-Hispanic minority (NURM). URM and NURM faculty were substantially more likely than majority faculty to perceive racial/ethnic bias in their academic environment (odds ratio [ORI, 5.4; P < .01 and OR, 2.6; P < .01, respectively). Nearly half (48%) of URM and 26% of NURM reported experiencing racial/ethnic discrimination by a superior or colleague. Faculty with such reported experi\u00ad ences had lower career satisfaction scores than other faculty IP < .01). However, they received comparable salaries, pub\u00ad lished comparable numbers of papers, and were simUarly likely to have attained senior rank (full or associate professor). CONCLUSIONS: Many minority faculty report experiencing racial/ethnic bias in academic medicine and have lower career satisfaction than other faculty. Despite this, minority faculty who reported experiencing racial/ ethnic discrimination achieved academic productivity almilar to that of other faculty.

Address correspondence and reprint requests to Dr. Peterson: CenterJorHealthSeroicesResearch.Suite6000.MedicalCenterEast. Nashville. TN 37232 (e-mail: up approximately 17% of full\u00ad time faculty in U.S. medical schools; just 4% are from underrepresented minority groups. I The underrep\u00ad resented minorities (URM) are defined as African Americans, Mexican Americans. mainland Puerto Ricans. and American Indians. Each URM group is substantially less prevalent in medicine than in the general populauon.f In comparison. approximately 30% of the U.S. population classify them\u00ad selves as nonwhite and about 22% are from URM groups.\" Recruiting and retaining minority faculty in academic medicine is important. Yet. little is known about the faculty experience of minorities, especially with regard to racial and ethnic discrimination. and how such experience affects their career satisfaction and academic success. Our study examines the frequency of self-reported experiences ofracial/ ethnic bias among faculty in U.S. medical schools. as well as associations of such experience with career satisfac\u00ad tion. and with academic productivity as evidenced by the number of peer-reviewed publications and academic rank. METHODS Study Design In 1995. we conducted a national mailed survey, described in detail elsewhere.\" to examine the status of minority. women. and generalist faculty in academic medicine. We used 2-stage sampling to select a sample of U.S. medical school faculty. In the first stage. we randomly selected 24 medical schools. Of the 126 medical schools listed by the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) in 1995, we excluded 6 schools outside the con\u00ad tiguous United States because the AAMC considers them to be significantly different from the mainland schools. To obtain adequate numbers of female and minority faculty from each institution. we also excluded 14 schools that had fewer than 200 total faculty. 50 female faculty. or 10 min\u00ad ority faculty. Our 24 medical schools were randomly selected from the remaining 106 eligible medical schools. The result\u00ad ingsample ofschools was balanced across theAAMC's4 U.S. regions and between public and private institutions. In the second stage. we selected full-time. salaried faculty members from the 24 schools using the 1994 AAMC Faculty Roster System. The AAMC listed 17.434 faculty at the 24 schools; 720 faculty were excluded because they were in unique departments not found at other medical schools. Of the remaining 16.714 faculty. 4.156 (25%) were women, 929 (6%) were minority. and 869 (6%) were generalists. For each institution, we employed a 4 x 3 x 2 factorial design for stratification. The factors were: 4 areas of medical specialization (primary care. basic science. medical specialties. and surgical specialties). 3 graduation cohorts 259 260 - Peterson et al., Racial/Ethnic Discrimination in Academic Medicine JGIM (receiving doctorate degree prior to 1970, between 1970 and 1980. and after 1980). and gender. Within each celI (school x medical specialty x graduation cohort x gender). we sought 6 faculty. The most senior celIs (by graduation cohort) were filIed first and then backftlled, if necessary. with more junior faculty. To obtain sufficient numbers. the sample was supplemented to include all minority. gener\u00ad alist. and senior women faculty. Due to confidentiality concerns of the AAMC. the mailed surveys were delinked from the sampling frame. making it impossible to separately calculate response rates within sampling strata. Data Collection and Survey Instrument We mailed 4,405 surveys to sampled faculty. of which 1,073 were ineligible. either because they had left their institutions (512). were not full time (510). had died (11). had participated in the pilot sample (9). or other reasons (31). Of the eligible 3.332 faculty. nonrespondents received reminder postcards. follow-up telephone calls. and survey remailings as necessary. One hundred forty-six respondents were excluded for one or more of the following reasons: they did not self-identify race/ethmctty (30). did not answer questions about bias (42). rank (95). or department (68). or did not complete most of the questionnaire (7). The self-administered questionnaire asked 177 ques\u00ad tions about faculty demographics. experiences of bias. discrimination, and harassment. professional goals and work situation. current academic environment and rank. academic productivity. faculty compensation. and career satisfaction. Approximately 10% of the survey items related to race-based discrimination. which could have occurred at any time over the faculty member's career. The Boston University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board approved this study. Definitions of Variables and Outcome Measures We divided faculty respondents' self-reported race/ ethnicity into 3 categories as defined by the AAMC: under\u00ad represented minority (URM; non-Hispanic Black; Mexican American and Puerto Rican Hispanic; Native American or Alaskan Native). nonunderrepresented minority (NURM; Asian and other Hispanic groups). and majority (non\u00ad Hispanic white). We coded specialties as follows: primary care [general internal medicine. general pediatrics, family medi\u00ad cine. and geriatrics): medical specialties (internal medicine subspectalties, pediatric neurology. physical medicine. radiology. emergency medicine. anesthesia. and psychiatry); surgical specialties (general surgery and its subspecialties): and basic science. We asked respondents to estimate the number of hours worked during an average professional work week and the amount of time spent in research. patient care. teaching. and administration. We asked 3 questions to characterize the experience of racial/ethnic bias: 1) \"Do you perceive any racial/ethnic biases or obstacles to the career success or satisfaction of faculty by race/ethnicity in your academic environment (1 = no. never to 5 = yes. frequently)?\"; 2) \"In your professional career, have you ever been left out of opportunities for professional advancement based on race/ethnicity (1 =no. 2 = not to my knowledge, 3 = possibly. 4 = probably. 5 = yes)?\"; and 3) \"In your professional career. have you per\u00ad sonally encountered racial/ethnic discrimination (unfair or injurious distinction or treatment) by a superior or colleague (1 = no. 2 = yes)?\" Faculty who answered \"yes\" to question 3 were asked 5 questions to capture the extent and severity of the racial/ ethnic discrimination they experienced: 1) \"How much of a problem has this been for you (l = no problem to 5 =major problem)?\"; 2) \"Have you encountered racial/ ethnic remarks (1 =no. 2 =yes)?\"; 3) \"Have you encountered inadequate recognition of your work (l =no. 2 =yes)?\"; 4) \"To what extent have these experiences had a negative effect on your confidence as a professional (1 = not at all to 5 = greatly)?\"; and 5) \"To what extent have these experiences negatively affected your career advancement (l =not at alI to 5 =greatly)?\" We also asked all faculty about several subjective and objective outcomes. To capture career satisfaction. we used a scale consisting of 4 items: \"How satisfied are you with 1) your current work setting. 2) your potential to achieve your professional goals, 3) your overall professional prac\u00ad tice and/or research. and 4) the extent to which this prac\u00ad tice and/or research has met your expectattons'P'\" Each item was measured on a Likert scale ranging from 1 (very dissatisfied) to 5 (very satisfied) (Cronbach's a = 0.87). Two other subjective outcome variables were measured from questions with 5-point Likert scales. These were 1) \"To what extent do you feel like a welcomed member in your institution?\" and 2) \"How likely are you to leave academic medicine within 5 years and go into another line of work?\" Career outcome variables included senior rank (as\u00ad sociate or full professor). salary. total career publications in refereed journals, and grants funded. Salary was 1995 pretax faculty compensation and included salary and other professional payments. but excluded fringe benefits. Grants funded was the number of grants with the respondent as the principal investigator that had received funding within the previous 2 years. Missing responses to numbers of publications or grants funded were treated as zeros. Analysis Frequency distributions. means. and standard devi\u00ad ations of characteristics were used to describe the survey respondents by minority status (URM. NURM. and ma\u00ad jority). The distributions of characteristics among majority faculty reflect the factorial sampling design. For example. the design sought approximately even numbers of men and women majority faculty. In contrast. minority respondent characteristics reflect a full-census sampling of all minority faculty at the selected medical schools. For questions that captured the perceptions or experiences of racial/ethnic bias. we used a 5-point Likert 261 JGiM Volwne 19. March 2004 scale. and scored any response of 3. 4. or 5 as positive. The magnitude of differences among racial/ethnic groups did not significantly change when responses of only 4 or 5 were scored as positive. We used multivariable analyses to test for relation\u00ad ships between faculty characteristics and perceptions and/ or experiences of racial/ethnic bias. The following variables appeared In all models: medical school, specialty (primary care. basic science. and medical and surgical specialties], minority status. gender. seniority (years since first faculty appointment). and seniority squared (to capture the declin\u00ad ing influence of additional years on outcomes). Analyses were performed using SAS statistical soft\u00ad ware. version 8.2 (SAS Institute Inc.. Cary. NC). We used Fisher's exact test to compare the frequency of racial/eth\u00ad nic discrimination by minority status. and linear regression (PROC GLM) to estimate the effects of having experi\u00ad enced racial/ethnic discrimination on feelings of welcome\u00ad ness. likelihood of leaving the current Institution. career satisfaction. salary. number of publications. and number of grants funded. We used logistic regression (PROC LOGISTIC) to estimate the effect on attainment of senior rank. In additional analyses. we also controlled for number of hours worked per week. percentage of time in research. and percentage of time in clinical work. Because we found few differences compared to the models using the original linear regression covartates described above. the results of the models using only the original list of variables are reported. We tested for multicollinearity between dependent variables in our models with the TOL and VIG options. We tested for interactions between minority status and the experience of racial/ethnic discrimination on all outcomes (career satisfaction. feelings of welcomeness. likelihood of leaving the current Institution. attainment of senior rank. salary. number of publications. and number of grants funded). We used mixed-effects regression modeling (PROC MIXED) to address clustering by medical school and compared the results to the findings using PROC GLM. None of the authors had any potential conflicts of interest. Authors had full access to all of the data In the study, and accept full responslbl1lty for the Integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation funded the study but had no role in its design. conduct. or reporting. RESULTS Demographics and Professional Characteristics Of the 3.332 eligible faculty study subjects. 1.979 returned the survey for a response rate of 60%. Eighty-two percent of respondents identified themselves as non\u00ad Hispanic white (majority). 10% as URM (Blacks [8%1.Mexican Americans [1%). Puerto Ricans [l%1. Native Americans or Alaskan Natives [0.3%]], and 8% as NURM (Asian or Pacific Islanders [7%] and other Hispanic Americans [1%)). Table 1 shows the demographic and professional characteristics offaculty respondents by the 3 racial/ethnic groups. Majority respondents were on average 2 years older and had been on the faculty for 2 years longer than minority respondents. More URM faculty were male (60%) than NURM (40%). NURM differed from the other 2 groups in how few were born in the United States (21% vs 74% and 88%. respectively) or had English as their primary language (65% vs 85% and 97%). The URM faculty were more likely to be in a medical specialty (45% vs 28% and 24%) and spent more time In clinical activities (39% vs 32% and 32%). They were less likely to be In the basic sclences (12% vs 28% and 25%], to be a full or associate professor (31% vs 41% and 58%], and had fewer career publications (15 vs 22 and 32). Perceived Bias Attributed to Faculty Race/Ethnicity Table 2 shows frequency of perceived racial/ethnic bias by minority status. Most (63%) of the URM faculty per\u00ad ceived racial/ethnic bias or obstacles to the career success or satisfaction of faculty in their academic environment compared to 50% of NURM and 29% of majority faculty. In the multivariable analyses. URM faculty had 5.4 times the odds of perceiving racial/ethnic bias In their academic environment than the majority faculty; NURM were also more likely than the majority faculty to perceive these problems (odds ratio [OR). 2.6). In addition. URM faculty and NURM faculty also significantly had more odds than the majority of having reported experiencing racial/ethnic bias In their professional advancement (OR, 12.8 and 6.9. respectively). Nearly half (48%) of URM and 26% of NURM faculty reported personally encountering racial/ ethnic discrimination by a superior or colleague compared to 7% of the majority faculty. Factors Associated with the Perception of Racial/Ethnic Bias Other faculty characteristics were examined for associ\u00ad ations with racial/ethnic bias. The following were signifi\u00ad cantly associated with reporting personal experiences of racial/ethnic bias: 1) Increasing age (OR, 1.5 per 10 years; 95% confidence Interval [CII. 1.1 to 2.1); 2) having a primary language other than English (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1 to 3.0); and 3) increasing number of hours worked (OR, 1.3 per 10 hours/week: 95% CI. 1.1 to 1.5). Medical school characteristics. Including which medical school a faculty memberwas at. whether it was a private or public institution. and Its regional location. were not significantly associated With reporting personal experiences of racial/ethnic bias. Most faculty who reported personal experiences of racial/ethnic discrimination stated instances In which their work was inadequately recognized (78%. 78%. and 63% of URM. NURM. and majority. respectively; P = .05) (Table 3). Most also reported personally encountering racial/ethnic remarks (P =.29). Smaller numbers of faculty felt that the discrimination had been a major problem for them (32%. 19%. and 28% of URM. NURM. and majority. respectively: P = .40) or that it had a major effect on their professional Peterson et al.. Racial]Ethnic Discrimination in Academic Medicine JGIM Table 1.

Similarly. Fang et al. showed that URM faculty at the assistant pro\u00ad fessor rank and at the associate professor rank were less likely to be promoted when compared to majority faculty.7 Racial/ethnic discrimination may be the reason for the promotion disparity;7.8 however. our current study did not find faculty's personal experiences of racial/ethnic bias was associated with attainment of senior rank (full or asso\u00ad ciate professor) independent of minority status. Our study showed that faculty who experienced racial/ ethnic bias were less likely to feel satisfied with their careers and less likely to feel welcomed in their institutions than those who did not. and the difference was a \"medium\" effect size.\" This may explain why URM faculty as a group has been found to be less satisfied with their careers. 10 This lack of satisfaction and belonging was present despite comparable salaries, numbers of publications. and grants. This finding may reflect that minority faculty are able to overcome their negative experiences at their institutions and still achieve high productivity in academic medicine. However, it may also reflect that we did not capture the true experience of all minority faculty because we did have a 40% nonresponse rate to our survey. We also had no way of capturing the experience of minority faculty who had already left academic medicine. To the extent that dis\u00ad crimination contributes to leaving. we may have under\u00ad represented the frequency of racial/ethnic bias, and underestimated its professional impact. The major limitation of our study is that it is cross\u00ad sectional and cannot follow the effects of racial/ethnic discrimination on faculty careers over time. Even though we report associations of racial/ethnic discrimination with several outcomes. we cannot determine cause and effect. For example. we cannot dtstmgutsh whether the perception of racial/ethnic bias results in lower job satisfaction or whether lower job satisfaction increases the perception of racial/ethnic bias. Our self-reported questionnaire format is not able to explore the qualitative experience of racial/ ethnic discrimination. We examined racial/ethnic dis\u00ad crimination by superiors and colleagues only and did not explore other possible sources of such problems, including patients and hospital staff. We do not know how well our data reflect the current academic environment for minority faculty. as the discrimination that we captured could have occurred at any point in the academic careers of the respondents. Finally, the results that we report are several years old. Since 1995, academic institutions have con\u00ad tinued to place increasing importance on minority faculty issues and cultural competence. Thus. the academic environment for minority faculty may have significantly improved since our study was conducted. Table 5.

We determined the frequency of racial/ethnic bias among a large group of medical faculty across all medical school departments using a national database. Because our study was part of a larger study examining the status of faculty in academic medi\u00ad cine, response bias should be less than in a more narrowly focused study of racial bias and discrimination only. The high frequency of perceived racial/ethnic dis\u00ad crimination among minority faculty is concerning. Under\u00ad standing the reasons for this and addressing the causes is both a moral and social issue for medical schools and teaching hospitals. In our study, we were not able to show that racial/ethnic discrimination explained the dispari\u00ad ties in academic advancement found in other studies and our previous work. Therefore. other explanations for disparities in academic promotion among minority faculty must be pursued. We thank Anita Palepu. MD.

INTRODUCTION Medicare is one of the world's largest health insurance programs, with annual expenditures exceeding $200 billion. It pro\u00ad vides health insurance to nearly 40 million beneficiaries entitled by elderly age, dis\u00ad ability, or ESRD. Approximately 11 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in private managed care health care plans, with the rest in the traditional FFS pro\u00ad gram.

Historically, capitation payments to MMC plans were linked to FFS expendi\u00ad tures by geographic area, with payments set at 95 percent of an enrollee's county's adjusted average per capita cost (AAPCC). The AAPCC actuarial rate cells were defined by: age, sex, Medicaid enrollment (indicating poverty), institutional status (fornursing home residents), and working aged status (for beneficiaries with employ\u00ad er-based insurance where Medicare is a secondary payer). Separate county factors were calculated for the aged and non-aged disabled (under 65 years), and at the State\u00ad level only (due to small numbers), for ESRD-entitled beneficiaries. The AAPCC payment methodology explains only about 1-percent of the varia\u00ad tion in expenditures for Medicare benefi\u00ad ciaries, and does not pay' more for sicker people. Thus, research showed that the managed care program was increasing total Medicare Program expenditures, because its enrollees were healthier than FFS enrollees, and the AAPCC did not account for this favorable selection (Brown et al., 1993; Riley et al., 1996; Mello et al., 1 The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) renames the M+C program Medicare Advantage. However, since this renaming ~~l'tltjI2006,we.continue to useMt~ 2004/Volume 25. Number 4 2003). Also, more money was not directed to plans enrolling sicker beneficiaries, or to plans specializing in treating high-cost pop\u00ad ulations, such as beneficiaries with particu\u00ad lar chronic diseases or high levels of func\u00ad tional impairment The M+C program fundamentally changed the MMC payment method, including a mandate for health-based Medicare capitation payments by 2000. To support this mandate, the BBA required managed care organizations (MCOs) to report inpatient encounter data (i.e., records for each inpatient admission of a plan's enrollees noting, among other things, the beneficiaries' diagnoses) begin\u00ad ning in 1998. In 2000 CMS, which adminis\u00ad ters the Medicare Program, implemented the PIP-DCG model as a health-based pay\u00ad ment adjuster (pope et al., 2000a). This model estimates beneficiary health status (expected cost next year) from AAPCC\u00ad like demographics and the worst principal inpatient diagnosis (principal reason for inpatient stay) associated with any hospital admission. PIP-DCG-based payments were introduced gradually, with only 10 percent of total Medicare capitation payments adjusted by PIP-DCG factors in 2000. The other 90 percent of payments were still adjusted using a purely demographic (AAPCC-like) model. The PIP-DCG model was intended as a transition, a feasible way to implement risk adjustment based on the readily available, already audited inpatient diagnostic data. Relying on inpatient diagnoses is the PIP\u00ad DCG model's major shortcoming, since only illnesses that result in hospital admis\u00ad sions are counted; MCOs that reduce admis-sions (e.g., through good ambulato\u00ad ry care) can end up with apparently health\u00ad ier patients and lower payments. Congress\"s-BIPK\"'(ZOOO) \"addressed the PIP-DCG limitations by requiring the use of ambulatory diagnoses in Medicare risk-adjustment, to be phased in from 2004 to 2007 at 30, 50, 75, and 100 percent of total payments. CMS began collecting encounter data from MCOs for the physician office and hospital outpatient settings (i.e., records of each enrollee visit to these providers with dates, procedures per\u00ad formed, diagnoses, etc.) in October 2000 and April 2001, respectively. However, fol\u00ad lowing complaints from MCOs about the burden of reporting encounter data, CMS suspended data collection in May 2001, ultimately adopting a drastically stream\u00ad lined data reporting strategy (discussed later). CMS evaluated several risk-adjustment models that use both ambulatory and inpa\u00ad tient diagnoses, including ACGs (Weiner et al., 1996),the chronic disease and disabili\u00ad ty payment system (CDPS) (Kronick et al., 2000), clinical risk groups (CRGs) (Hughes etal.,2004), the clinicallydetailed risk information system for cost (CD-RISC) (Kapur et al., 2003), and DCG/HCCs (pope et al, 2000b). CMS chose the DCG/HCC model for Medicare risk-adjust\u00ad ment, largely on the basis of transparency, ease of modification, and good clinical coherence. The DCG/HCC model, part of the same DCG family of models as the PIP\u00ad DCG,wasdeveloped with CMSfunding by researchers at RTI International- and Boston University, with clinical input from physicians at Harvard Medical School. 3 Prior to implementing Medicare risk\u00ad adjustment in 2004, the DCG/HCC model developers and eMS staff adapted the orig\u00ad inal model for consistency with CMS' sim\u00ad plified data collection, and for customized fit for Medicare subpopulations. The resulting CMS-HCC model reflects these 2Theearly development ofthe DCG/HCCmodelwasdoneby HealthEconomics Research,Inc.whileundercontractto CMS. However. et al, (1996).

The next section describes the DCG/HCC model, including the principles and elements of its diagnos\u00ad tic classificationsystem and how its perfor\u00ad mance compares to earlier models. We then describe the modifications to accom\u00ad modate the simplified data that lead to the CMS-HCC model. The final section describes the CMS-HCC model adapta\u00ad tions for subpopulations. DCG/HCC MODEL PRINCIPLES Diagnostic Classification System The following ten principles guided the creation of the diagnostic classification sys\u00ad tem. Principle i-Diagnostic categories should be clinically meaningful. Each diagnostic category is a set of ICD-9-CM codes (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2004). These codes should all relate to a reasonably well-specified disease or medical condition that defines the cate\u00ad gory. Conditions must be sufficiently clini\u00ad cally specific to minimize opportunities for gaming or discretionary coding. Clinical meaningfulness improves the face validity of the classification system to clinicians, its interpretability, and its utility for disease management and quality monitoring. Principle 2-Diagnostic categories should predict medical expenditures. Diagnoses in the same HCC should be rea\u00ad sonably homogeneous with respect to their effect on both current (this year's) and future (next year's) costs. (In this article \"--we--present prcspectivernodels'predicting -\u00ad future costs.) Principle 3-Diagnostic categories that will affect payments should have adequate sample sizes to permit accurate and stable estimates of expenditures. Diagnostic cate\u00ad gories used in establishing payments should have adequate sample sizes in avail\u00ad abledatasets. Giventhe extreme skewness of medical expenditure data, the data can\u00ad not reliably determine the expected cost of extremely rare diagnostic categories. Principle 4-In creating an individual's clinical profile, hierarchies should be used to characterize the person's illness level within each disease process, while the effects of unrelated disease processes accumulate. Because each new medical problem adds to an individual's total dis\u00ad ease burden, unrelated disease processes should increase predicted costs of care. However, the most severe manifestation of a given disease process principally defines its impact on costs. Therefore, related con\u00ad ditions should be treated hierarchically, with more severe manifestations of a con\u00ad dition dominating (and zeroing out the effect of) less serious ones. Principle 5-The diagnostic classifica\u00ad tion should encourage specific coding. Vague diagnostic codes should be grouped with less severe and lower-paying diagnos\u00ad tic categories to provide incentives for more specific diagnostic coding. Principle 6---The diagnostic classifica\u00ad tion should not reward coding prolifera\u00ad tion. The classification should not measure greater disease burden simply because more ICD-9-CM codes are present Hence, neither the number of times that a particu\u00ad lar code appears, nor the presence of addi\u00ad tional, closely related codes that indicate the same condition should increase pre\u00ad dicted costs. Principle 'I-Providers should not be penalized 'foF\u00b7~re(!ording~-additional.....diag\u00ad noses (monotonicity). This principle has HEALllI CARE FINANCING REVIEW/Summer 2004/Volume25,Number4 121 two consequences for modeling: (1) no condition category should carry a negative payment weight, and (2) a condition that is higher-ranked in a disease hierarchy (causing lower-rank diagnoses to be ignored) should have at least as large a payment weight as lower-ranked condi\u00ad tions in the same hierarchy. Principle 8-The classification system should be internally consistent (transitive). If diagnostic category A is higher-ranked than category B in a disease hierarchy, and category B is higher-ranked than category C, then category A should be higher\u00ad ranked than category C. Transitivity improves the internal consistency of the classification system, and ensures that the assignment of diagnostic categories is independent of the order in which hierar\u00ad chical exclusion rules are applied. Principle 9-The diagnostic classifica\u00ad tion should assign all ICD-9-CM codes (exhaustive classification). Since each diagnostic code potentially contains rele\u00ad vant clinical information, the classification should categorize all ICD-9-CM codes. Principle la-Discretionary diagnostic categories should be excluded from pay\u00ad ment models. Diagnoses that are particu\u00ad larly subject to intentional or unintentional discretionary coding variation or inappro\u00ad priate coding by health plans/providers, or that are not clinically or empirically credi\u00ad ble as cost predictors, should not increase cost predictions. Excluding these diag\u00ad noses reduces the sensitivity of the model to coding variation, coding proliferation, gaming, and upcoding. In designing the diagnostic classifica\u00ad tion, principles 7 (monotonicity), 8 (transi\u00ad tivity), and 9 (exhaustive classification) were followed absolutely. For example, if the expenditure weights for our models did jf6C~origin\"ID1y satisfy monotonicity, ---\"we imposed constraints to create models that did. Judgment was used to make tradeoffs among other principles. For example, clin\u00ad ical meaningfulness (principle 1) is often best served by creating a very large num\u00ad ber of detailed clinical groupings. But a large number of groupings conflicts with adequate sample sizes for each category (principle3). Anothertradeoff isencourag\u00ad ing specificcoding (principle5) versus pre\u00ad In current cod\u00ad ing practice, non-specific codes are com\u00ad mon. Ifthese codes are excluded from the classificationsystem, substantial predictive power is sacrificed. Similarly, excluding discretionary codes (principle 10) can also lower predictive power (principle 2). We approached the inherent tradeoffs involved in designing a classification system using empirical evidence on frequencies and pre\u00ad dictive power, clinical judgment on related\u00ad ness, specificity, and severity of diagnoses, and the judgment of the authors on incen\u00ad tives and likely provider responses to the classificationsystem. The DCG/HCC mod\u00ad els balance these competing goals to achieve a feasible health-based payment system. Elements and Organization As shown in Figure 1, the HCC diagnos\u00ad tic classification system first classifies each of over 15,000 ICD-9-CM codes into 804 diagnostic groups, or DxGroups. Each ICD-9-CM code maps to exactly one DxGroup, which represents a well-speci\u00ad fied medical condition, such as DxGroup 28.01 Acute Liver Disease. DxGroups are further aggregated into 189 Condition Categories, or CCS.4 CCs describe a broader set of similar diseases, generally organized into body systems, somewhat like ICD-9-CM major diagnostic categories. 4 MostCCsareassignedentirelywith is defined by procedure codes only. CC 129, ESRD is defined by Medicare entitlementstatus.NoneoftheseCCsare includedin the CMS-HCC model.

However, six inter\u00ad actions were substantial in magnitude, sta\u00ad tistically significant, and clinically plausi\u00ad ble. Hence, to improve clinical face validity and predictive accuracy for important sub\u00ad groups of beneficiaries, we include them in the DCG/HCC model. For example, the simultaneous presence of CHF and COPD leads to higher expected costs than would be calculated by adding the separate incre\u00ad ments for we ~so ~nint'!d2lt-~\u00b7~ interactions of cancer With the other SIX diagnoses, but did not find any significant effects. Because a single beneficiary may be coded for none, one, or more than one DxGroup or HCC, the DCG/HCC model can individually price tens of thousands of distinct clinical profiles using fewer than 200 parameters. The model's structure thus provides, and predicts from, a detailed comprehensive clinical profile for each individual. HCCs are assigned using hospital and physician diagnoses from any of five sources: (1) principal hospital inpatient; (2) secondary hospital inpatient; (3) hospital outpatient; (4) physician; and (5) clinically\u00ad trained non-physician (e.g., psychologist, podiatrist). The DCG/HCC model does not distinguish among sources; in particu\u00ad lar, it places no premium on diagnoses from inpatient care. Using Medicare 5-per\u00ad cent sample FFS data, we investigated adding diagnoses from other sources (pope et al., 2000b). Adding diagnoses ..-frotlf\" home health providers -raised-the I f thb d I e: exp anatory power REVIEW/Summer 2004/Volwne 25.Nwnber4 124 11.15 to 11.65 percent. Further adding diagnoses from DME suppliers raised the explanatory power from 11.65 to 11.85per\u00ad cent. All other sources of diagnoses either add no predictive power (SNF, ASC, or hos\u00ad pice) or detract from predictive power (clinical laboratory and radiology/imaging clinics). Diagnoses assigned by home health and DME providers are likely to be less reliable than those assigned by physi\u00ad cians or other providers with greater clini\u00ad cal training. Diagnoses from laboratory and imaging tests are also problematic given the significant proportion of rule-out diagnoses. In implementing the CMS-HCC model, potential gains in predictive power from using additional sources were bal\u00ad anced against the costs of collecting and auditing these data; the decision was to only ask MCOs to collect diagnoses from the five baseline sources previously listed. Consistent with principle 10, we excluded discretionary diagnostic categories (HCCs) from the preliminary prospective payment model. We excluded diagnoses that were vague/non-specific (e.g.,symptoms), discre-\u00ad tionary in medical treatment or coding (e.g., osteoarthritis), not medically significant (e.g., muscle strain), or transitory or defini\u00ad tively treated (e.g., appendicitis). We also excluded HCCs that did not (empirically) add to costs, and finally, the five HCCs that were definedbythe presence ofprocedures or use of DME, because, as much as possi\u00ad ble, we wanted payments to follow what medical problems were present as opposed to what services were offered,\" Altogether, weexcluded88ofthe 189 HCCs,leaving101 HCCs in the preliminary prospective pay\u00ad ment model. As discussed further, addition\u00ad al HCCs were excluded from the final, 70\u00ad category CMS-HCC model. 7 The-DME HCes were developed to predict costs associatetl withfunctional impairmentnotcapturedbydiagnoses.Although they did improve prediction for the functionally impaired, sub\u00ad stantial under-prediction remained (pope et al., 2000b; Kautter and Pope, 2001). The DCG/HCC model also relies on demographics. Demographic adjusters included in the model are 24 mutually exclusive age/sex cells (e.g., female, age 65-69), an indicator for at least I-month of Medicaid enrollment in the base year (a poverty indicator), and an indicator of orig\u00ad inally disabled status. The age cells distin\u00ad guish beneficiaries currently entitled to Medicare by age (65 or over) versus dis\u00ad ability (under 65); a separate, explicit aged versus disabled entitlement status indica\u00ad tor would be redundant. The originally dis\u00ad abled indicator distinguishes beneficiaries who are currently age 65 or over, but were first entitled to Medicare before age 65 by disability. The age/sex, Medicaid, and originally disabled categories add to each other and to the HCC diagnostic cate\u00ad goriesf The demographic variables are the same as have been used in the PIP\u00ad DCG model, and are discussed at greater length elsewhere (pope et al., 2000a). Figure 3 displays a hypothetical clinical vignette of a female age 79, eligible for Medicaid and diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), angina pec\u00ad toris, COPD, renal failure, chest pain, and an ankle sprain. Note that although this female receives CCs for both AMI and angina, she receives no HCC for angina because AMI is a more severe manifesta\u00ad tion of coronary artery disease. Also note that while payment includes additive incre-\u00ad ments for females age 75-79 (demographic categories not shown in Figure 3), Medicaid, AMI, COPD, and renal failure, the HCCs for major symptoms and other injuries are excluded from the payment cal\u00ad culation.

SOURCE: (Popeet aI., 2000b.) percent in a demographic model, 81 percent in the PIP-DCG model, but only 43 percent in the DCG/HCC model (pope et al., 2001). With over one-half of payments determined by diagnoses, the DCG/HCC model moves decisively away from the AAPCC demo\u00ad graphic-based payment system. Table 1 shows predictive ratios for selected groups of Medicare beneficiaries. Ratios close to 1.0 indicate accurate predic\u00ad tion of costs; less than 1.0, under predic\u00ad tion; and, more than 1.0, over prediction. The PIP-DCG model improves substantial\u00ad lyon age/sex, and in almost all cases, the DCG/HCC model improves significantly on the PIP-DCG model. This is true even for hospitalizations, where the PIP-DCG model distinguishes between those hospi\u00ad talized or not, while the DCG/HCC model makes no distinction by source of diagno\u00ad sis.9 Despite the DCG/HCC model's impressive gains over the age/sex and PIP-DCG models, it still under-predicts for the most expensive and most often hospi\u00ad talized beneficiaries. CMS-HCC MODEL This section describes how the DCG/HCC model was modified before implementation as the M+C risk adjuster for capitation payments in 2004. We will refer to the modified model as CMS-HCC.

One measure of the data collection burden imposed by a model is its number of diagnostic categories. lO We investigated the relationship between number of diagnostic categories used in the DCG/HCC model and its predictive power (pope et al., 2001). Figure 4 plots the rela\u00ad tionship between number of diagnostic cat\u00ad egories and power mea\u00ad sured by J?2. Diagnostic categories (HCCs) were entered into the model in descending order of their incremental explanatory power using stepwise regression.

Some MCOs seemed to feel that it would be less burdensome to report all diagnoses, which CMS allows. The incremental contribution to predic\u00ad tive power declines rapidly with the number of diagnostic categories added to the model.

HEALnI CARE FINANCING REVIEW/Summer 2004/Volume 25, Number 4 128 This analysis shows that a parsimonious risk-adjustment model with a substantially reduced number of diagnostic categories is almost as predictive as a full model. But parsimony has a cost. In limiting the num\u00ad ber of conditions that affect payment, many serious, high-cost diagnoses--especially rare ones-will be ignored. MCOs enrolling beneficiaries with excluded diag\u00ad noses willbe disadvantaged, and beneficia\u00ad ries with such conditions may not be well served by MCOs. CMS considered these results, and con\u00ad sulted with clinicians, on the tradeoff between number of diagnostic categories and predictive power, and also other crite\u00ad ria for diagnostic categories to include in risk adjustment, such as well-defined diag\u00ad nostic criteria and clinical coherence and homogeneity. It was important that the HCC hierarchies not be disrupted by dele\u00ad tion of higher-ranked HCCs while lower\u00ad ranked HCCs were retained. After this process, CMS selected 70 HCCs to include in the CMS-HCC model. The choices reflect a balance among the competing considerations of reducing data collection burden, maximizing predictive power, including rare, high-eost conditions, and selecting only well-defined and clinically coherent conditions. Generally, the higher\u00ad cost, more severe conditions at the top of the HCC disease hierarchies were retained, while some lower-cost, more fre\u00ad quent and more discretionary conditions at the bottom of the hierarchies were pruned. For example, in the coronary artery dis\u00ad ease hierarchy, AMI (heart attack), other acute IHD (e.g., unstable angina), and angina pectoris/old myocardial but chronic (e.g., coro\u00ad nary atherosclerosis) was excluded. After the CMS-HCC model was finalized, \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7a Iistof appreximately 3,000 of the more than 15,000 ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes was identified that are sufficient to define the model's 70 HCCs. In addition, because the CMS-HCC model does not give extra cred\u00ad it for multiple reports of the same diagno\u00ad sis, MCOs need only report a single encounter during the relevant year of data collection that establishes the diagnosis. The information required for the single encounter is: (1) beneficiary identification number, (2) date (to establish that the diag\u00ad nosis was made during the relevant report\u00ad ing period), (3) setting (to establish that the diagnosis was made in one of the allowed hospital or physician settings), and (4) ICD-9-CM diagnosis code. In short, MCOs are required to report only the min\u00ad imum. Concern about the quality of diagnostic reporting is the greatest in physician offices, where diagnoses have not hereto\u00ad fore affected payment, and recording of diagnoses is less rigorously practiced than in hospitals. The auditing standard that CMS has promulgated for reporting of physician office diagnoses is that a physi\u00ad cian has established the diagnosis in the medical record, and that medical coders have recorded it in accordance with ICD-9\u00ad CMrules. CMS will conduct coding audits, but not clinical audits. That is, CMS will require MCOs to demonstrate that a diag\u00ad nosis is present in the medical record on the specified date and has been coded according to ICD-9-CM. CMS will not require clinical verification of these diag\u00ad noses, such as diagnostic test results. CMS-HCC Model Calibration We calibrated the CMS-HCC model to 1999-2000 Medicare 5-percent sample FFS data for beneficiaries entitled by age or dis\u00ad ability (beneficiaries entitled by ESRD were excluded). The model is prospective, ~\u00b7\"meaningthat diagnoses collected m.J)asez,.\", ... ,.~.~~~= year (1999) are used to predict expendi\u00ad tures in the following year (2000). An 129 REALm CARE FINANCING REVIEW/Summer 2004lvolume25,Number4 important operational change from the PIP-DCG model is that the data lag will be eliminated, making the application of the model consistent with its calibration. With the PIP-DCG model, the data collection period for a payment year ended 6 months before the start of the year, i.e., on June 30 of the previous year, so that final capitation rates could be published by January 1 of the payment year. With the CM5-HCC model, provisional rates willbe established by January 1 based on 6-month lagged data, and final rates will be available by June 30 of the payment year based on the previous calendar year's diagnoses. A rec\u00ad onciliation process will adjust the first 6 months of payments to the final rates, if necessary. A standard set of sample restrictions was employed to ensure a population of benefi\u00ad ciaries with complete 12-month base year diagnostic profiles and complete payment year Medicare expenditures from the FFS claims for aged and disabled beneficiaries (pope et al., 2oo0b). Decedents are includ\u00ad ed in the payment year for their eligible period. Complete FFS claims are not avail\u00ad able for months of M+C enrollment or when Medicare is a secondary payer, and M+C plans are not responsible for hospice care, so these months were excluded from our sample. The final sample size is 1,337,887 beneficiaries. We summed all Medicare payments for a beneficiary for months in 2000 satisfying our sample restrictions, excluding (1) deductibles and copayments paid by the beneficiary; (2) hospice payments; and (3) indirect medical education payments. Hospice and indirect medical education payments are excluded because they were not included in M+C capitation rates, but were paid directly to hospices and teaching hospitals utilized by M+C enrollees.>\u00ad Payments were annualized by dividing them by the fraction of months in 2000 that satisfy our sample restrictions; all analyses are weighted by this eligibility fraction. In general, annualization and weighting ensures that monthly payments are cor\u00ad rectly estimated for all beneficiaries, including those who died (Ellis et al., 1996).11 The model was calibrated using weight\u00ad ed least squares multiple regression. The CM5-HCC regression model estimated for the combined aged and disabled Medicare population is shown in Table 2. The elements of the model are: Agel sex cells (24). Medicaid interacted with sex and agel disabled entitlement status. Originally disabled status interacted with sex. HCC diagnostic categories (70). Interactions of diagnostic categories with entitlement by disability (5). Disease interactions (6). The J?2 for this model is 9.8 percent. Several coefficients are constrained because the unconstrained coefficients vio\u00ad late the principle that higher-ranked condi\u00ad tions in a hierarchy should have higher predicted costs, or for other reasons.V As an example of expenditure predic\u00ad tion, consider our hypothetical scenario in Figure 3 of a female age 79 eligible for Medicaid diagnosed with AMI, angina pec\u00ad toris, COPD, renal failure, chest pain, and an ankle sprain. The female receives the following incremental cost predictions: female, 75 to 79, $2,562; aged, female, calibration. we did not make any geographic adjust\u00ad ments to Medicare payments. In past work, we have found that deflating payments by a geographic input price index had little effect on estimated risk-adjustment model parameters. 12Clinical consultants toCMS suggested that metastatic cancer is not consistently correctly coded, so HCCs 7 an.~ $ were con\u00ad strained to have equal coefficients. HCCs 81 and 82 were con\u00ad strained to have equal coefficients because the ICD-9-CM diag\u00ad nostic detail CMS collects from health plans is not sufficient to distinguish them.

Calibration of nCG/HCC models on sev\u00ad eral years of data reveals increasingly thor\u00ad ough diagnostic coding. For example, if 1999 diagnoses are used to predict expen\u00ad ditures with a model calibrated on 1996/1997 data, mean expenditures will be over predicted. If more complete coding over time is not accounted for, MCOs will be overpaid by the use of current diag\u00ad noses with a model calibrated on historical data. CMS makes a slight downward adjustment in HCC-predicted expenditures to account for this. CMS-HCC Models for Subpopulations Medicare beneficiaries differ along char\u00ad acteristics that are important for risk adjust\u00ad ment. First, they may be entitled to Medicare in one of three ways: age, disabili\u00ad ty, or ESRD. Second, some beneficiaries reside in institutions rather than in the com\u00ad munity. Third, some enrollees are new to 13The female receives no incrementalcost prediction do not have complete diag\u00ad nostic data. Fourth, Medicare is a secondary payer for some beneficiaries. To account for the different cost and diagnostic patterns of these disparate subgroups of beneficiaries, the CMS-HCC model was adapted for Medicare subpopulations. This section describes models for subpopulations.t! Beneficiaries Entitled by Disability Approximately 12 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are entitled to Medicare because they are under age 65 and have a medical condition that prevents them from working (the disabled). Models calibrated on the full Medicare population (excluding ESRD eligibles), mostly reflect cost pat\u00ad terns among the elderly, the other 88 per\u00ad cent of the population. The implications of some diagnoses might differ between the elderly and disabled. For example, a diag\u00ad nosis that is disabling may be more severe, and the cost of treating a disease may vary by age. We considered allowing differ\u00ad ences in incremental expenditure weights for some dis\u00ad sample FFS data (1996-1997), we estimated the DCG/HCC model separately on aged and disabled subsamples. We evaluated differ\u00ad ences in age versus disabled parameter estimates according to their statistical sig\u00ad nificance, magnitude, clinical plausibility, and frequency of occurrence in the dis\u00ad abled population (pope et al., 2000b). Based on these considerations, we chose nine diagnostic categories to receive incre\u00ad mental payments when they occur among disabled beneficiaries. Five of these cate\u00ad gories remained significantly different for the disabled when the CMS-HCC model was re-estimated on 1999-2000 data: oppor\u00ad mia), drug/alcohol psychosis, drug/alco\u00ad hol dependence, and cystic fibrosis. Incremental annual payments for these conditions among the disabled (in addition to base payments for the elderly) are sub\u00ad stantial, ranging from $2,160to $9,69l. Other than for these five conditions, dis\u00ad ease risk-adjustment weights are the same for the aged and disabled populations. The CMS-HCC model is estimated on a com\u00ad bined sample of aged and disabled benefi\u00ad ciaries, with disabled interactions for these five diagnostic categories. The combined aged/disabled model is shown in Table 2. Community and Institutional Residents Using the newly available Medicare MDS, we identified long-term nursing home residents in the current (i.e., pay\u00ad ment) year. Long-term nursing home resi\u00ad dence was defined as continuously resid\u00ad ing in a nursing home for at least 90 days, as indicated by a 9O-day clinical assess\u00ad ment reported by the-nursing-facility through the MDS. In our prospective risk\u00ad adjustment modeling sample of 1,337,887 beneficiaries, 65,593 beneficiaries, or 5 per\u00ad cent, had at least 1 month of long-term nursing facility residence in 2000.15 Table 3 compares sample sizes and mean expenditures by demographic cate\u00ad gories for community and institutional res\u00ad idents, and shows predictive ratios from the CMS-HCC model calibrated on the combined community/institutional sample (fable 2). Nearly one-half (49 percent) of long-term nursing facility residents are age 85or over.Facility residents are only2per\u00ad cent of the combined community plus insti\u00ad tutionalpopulationforfemales age 70to 74, but fully 37 percent of the combined popu\u00ad lation for females age 95 or over. Overall, institutional residents are 71 percent more expensive than community residents, $8,937 in mean annualized expenditures compared to $5,213. The age profiles of expenditures are quite different Among community residents, mean expen\u00ad ditures rise steadily with age in the under 65 disabled population and then again in the elderly population, except for a slight decline for the oldest females. In contrast, among the institutionalized, mean expendi\u00ad tures are fairly constant across all ages until they decline significantly among the oldest old. For all age/sex cells except the oldest old, mean expenditures for the insti\u00ad tutionalized are substantially higher than for community-dwelling beneficiaries. However, although not shown in Table 3, among beneficiaries diagnosed with partic\u00ad ular HCCs, mean expenditures for the institutionalized are often similar to those of community residents. For example, among all beneficiaries with CHF (HCC 80), expenditures for the institutionalized are $11,719, which is $255 less than for community residents.

The over-prediction of the costs of the institutionalized, together with their different cost patterns by age and diagnosis, led us to consider differentiating the CMS-HCC model for community and institutional populations. Within a multiple regression model esti\u00ad mation framework, we investigated alter\u00ad native approaches to allowing differences in the model between community and insti\u00ad tutional residents, ultimately choosing to estimate separate models. This properly calibrates the prediction of each group's costs, while allowing all demographic and disease coefficients to differ between com\u00ad munity and institutional populations. In addition to the combined model, Table 2 shows the CMS-HCC community and institutional models. Not surprisingly, the community model J?2 and most of the demographic and disease coefficients are very similar to the combined model, because community residents comprise 95 percent of the combined sample. A few coefficients show greater differences. The community coefficients for the oldest age cells are significantly larger than the com\u00ad bined model coefficients because the lower-cost very old institutionalized have been removed from these cells. The com\u00ad munity coefficients for the aged enrolled in Medicaid are also significantly higher, as are several HCC coefficients. The institutional model J?2 is consider\u00ad ably lower than the community model. But some of the community model's predictive power comes from distinguishing benefi\u00ad ciaries who are healthy (no diagnoses) ver\u00ad sus sick (with diagnoses), while the insti\u00ad tutional model is explaining cost variations among a population comprised entirely of impaired individuals. Diagnoses help explain why someone might be institution\u00ad alized (Le., distinguish healthy from sick), but are not as powerful in explaining expenditure differences among the institu\u00ad tionalized. Disease (HCC) coefficients tend to be smaller in the institutional model than in the community model (fable 2). Diagnoses are less predictive of incremental costs among the more uni\u00ad formly expensive institutional population than they are among the community popu\u00ad lation. We constrained certain groups of demo\u00ad graphic and diagnostic coefficients in the institutional model to be equal (fable 2), because the small available sample of insti\u00ad tutionalized beneficiaries resulted in their low prevalence in some diagnostic cate\u00ad gories (HCCs) and made it difficult to obtain stable estimates of each separate parameter. For the same reason, we includ\u00ad ed no disabled interaction terms, and only two of the disease interaction terms in the institutional model. Also, HCC 158 Hip Fracture/Dislocation was excluded because its coefficient was negative. The age/sex coefficients for the institu\u00ad tionalized are much higher than for com\u00ad munity residents except for the oldest ages. This implies that institutionalized beneficiaries are predicted to be expensive regardless of their diagnostic profile (e.g., even lacking any of the diagnoses included in the CMS-HCC model), whereas commu\u00ad nity residents are predicted to be expen\u00ad sive only if diagnosed with at least one of the serious diseases included in the CMS\u00ad HCC model. This makes sense since insti\u00ad tutionalization itself is a marker of poor health, aside from diagnostic profile, but the institutionalized age/sex coefficients decline for the oldest ages, and fall below the community coefficients. Medical treat\u00ad ment may be less aggressive for old, frail beneficiaries who are institutionalized. Among the institutional population, the coefficient for Medicaid was negative and the coefficients for originally disabled was statistically insignificant. These variables HEALnI CARE FINANCING REVIEW/Summer 2004/Volume25, Number 4 137 were excluded from the institutional model. Beneficiaries often qualify for Medicaid after spending down their per\u00ad sonal assets to pay for a lengthy nursing home stay. Thus, Medicaid may be a proxy for beneficiaries in the later portion of their stays, when they are less expensive than in the earlier, post-acute phase of their nurs\u00ad ing home tenure. New Medicare Enrollees The CM5-HCC model requires a com\u00ad plete 12-month base year diagnostic profile to predict the next year's expenditures. Beneficiaries without 12 months base year Medicare enrollment, but at least 1 month of prediction year enrollment, are defined as new enrollees. About two-thirds of new enrollees are age 65,16 New enrollees may be under age 65 ifthey become eligible for Medicare by disability; they may be over age 65 if they delay Medicare enrollment or are not originally enrolled in both Parts A and B,17 We developed a demographic model to predict expenditures for new enrollees who lack the data needed to apply the CMS-HCC model. Table 4 presents frequencies and mean annualized expenditures from the 5-per\u00ad cent FFS sample data for new enrollees and continuing enrollees. Continuing enrollees are defined as beneficiaries hav\u00ad ing 12 months of Parts A and B Medicare enrollment in the base year and at least 1 month in the prediction year. For female andmalenew enrollees age 65,meanannu\u00ad alized expenditures are $2,729 and $2,900, respectively, less than one-half of costs of III To simplify the new enrollees model, we recoded new enrollees age 64 on February 1 with an original reason for Medicare entitlement ofaged to age 65.Thus, the age 65cellin the new enrollees model combines new enrollees ages 64 and 65 on February 1 of the prediction year whose original reason for entitlement is aged.' 17For example, a beneficiary might be entitled to Part A (hospi\u00ad tal insurance) by age at age 65 or over, but might not pay Part B (physician insurance) premium until an older age. continuing enrollees ($6,952 for female and $6,055 for male). For almost all new enrollees age 65, the original reason for Medicare entitlement is age,18 In contrast, continuing enrollees age 65were originally entitled to Medicare by disability, and hence are much more expensive.For other ages, mean expenditures of new and con\u00ad tinuing enrollees are much more similar. To achieve sufficient sample sizes in all age ranges to calibrate the new enrollees model, we merged the new and continuing enrollees samples, which resulted in a sam\u00ad ple size of 1,495,225 with mean expendi\u00ad tures of $5,184. For age 65, actual new enrollees dominate the combined sample, and the cost weight reflects their (low) rel\u00ad ative costs. Continuing enrollees age 65 are included in the sample to calibrate the originally disabled coefficient for age 65. For other than age 65, the sample is domi\u00ad nated by continuing enrollees, but their costs appear to proxy actual new enrollee costs reasonably well for younger or older ages. Beneficiaries for Whom Medicare is a Secondary Payer Workingaged beneficiariesare Medicare beneficiaries, age 65 or over, with private group health insurance coveragefrom their or their spouse's employer. By law, Medicare is a secondary payer for these beneficiaries. The primary private health plan must pay for medical expenses to the extent of its defined benefits. Only if Medicare covers services not covered by the privateplan, or has more generous cov\u00ad erage (e.g., lower deductibles or copay\u00ad merits) for Medicare-covered services, is Medicare responsible for payment, and then only to the extent of the difference in 18Someage 65new eIu-ollee~ -ni'iihthi~e originallybeen entitled to Medicare by disability when under age 65, but then have rejoined the work force and lost their Medicare eligibility, only to re-enroll at age 65.

The CMS-HCC community HEAL1H CARE FINANCING REVIEW/Summer 2004/Volume25,Number4 139 ----------------- model over-predicts mean working aged expenditures by a factor of 3.66. Essentially, we define the working aged multiplier as the ratio of mean actual to mean predicted expenditures for the work\u00ad ing aged sample, where expenditures are predicted by the CMS-HCC community model. With an adjustment for beneficia\u00ad ries who have a mixture of working aged and non-working-aged months in the pay\u00ad ment year, the working aged multiplier is 0.215. CONCLUSIONS CMS' adaptation of the DCG/HCC model makes substantially more accurate predictions of medical costs for M+C enrollees than has previously been possi\u00ad ble. Its use is intended to redirect money away from MCOs that cherry-pick the healthy, while providing the MCOs that care for the sickest patients the resources to do so. The ultimate purpose of the CMS\u00ad HCC payment model is to promote fair payments to MCOs that reward efficiency and encourage excellent care for the chronically ill. The CMS-HCC model will continue to evolve. Additional diagnoses may be needed to predict drug expendi\u00ad tures incurred under the drug benefit enacted by MMA (2003). The model may need to be recalibrated to reflect new treat\u00ad ment patterns and disease prevalence. Diagnosis-based risk adjustment may need to be coordinated with disease manage. ment programs and incentives for quality of care. The model has evolved over two decades of research.w with careful attention to clin\u00ad ical credibility, real-world incentives and feasibility tradeoffs.

Much of the recent research reported in this article has relat\u00ad ed to adapting the model for Medicare sub\u00ad populations. The use of a single modeling framework-the CMS-HCC model-pro\u00ad vides unity and organization to the sub\u00ad group models with the unique features spe\u00ad cific to certain types of beneficiaries. Comprehensive risk adjustment, based on ambulatory as well as inpatient diagnoses, is just beginning to be implemented. Thus, it is too early to tell whether it will achieve its goals. As risk adjustment continues to be incorporated in Medicare payments to MCOs, it will be important to evaluate its impact on these organizations and the ben\u00ad eficiaries they serve, especially organiza\u00ad tions that care for the chronically ill and their enrollees. This will tell us a great deal about the feasibility and consequences of matching health care resources to needs.

Many persons who drink excessively remain unidentified and do not receive interventions. Screening and intervention using the World Wide Web could make such services more accessible and therefore more widely used. Objective. To evaluate the use of a novel alcohol screening and brief intervention Web site. Design. A Web site was developed, posted, and its use was evaluated. We analyzed a sample ofvisitors who completed alcohol screening over a 14-month period to describe their alcohol use, and their use of portions of the Web site that provide information and referral resources. Setting. The Internet. Patients or other participants. Web site visitors, with a focus on visitors who completed an alcohol-screening questionnaire about their own drinking. Intervention. Brief intervention via the Web site, consisting mainly of feedback, advice, and a menu of change options and referral information. Main outcome measures. Self-reponed drinking amounts and alcohol screening test scores, and utilization of Web site components. Results. Visitorscompleted online alcohol screening questionnaires at a rate of 50,711/year of 115,925 visitors/year. In a 14-month period, 39,842 adults completed the questionnaire about their own drinking habits; 66% were men, 90% reported drinking hazardous amounts (per occasion or typical weekly amounts), 88% reported binge (per occasion) drinking, and 55% reported typically exceeding weekly risky drinking limits. Most (65%) had alcohol screening test results (AUDIT ~ 8) consistent with alcohol abuse or dependence; similar proportions of women and men were hazardous drinkers. One-fifth of visitors visited portions of the Web site that provided additional information about alcohol use and referrals. Visitors with possible alcohol abuse or dependence were more likely than those without these disorders to visit a part of the Web site designed for those seeking additional help (33% vs. 8%, P < 0.0001). Conclusions. A well-publicized, easily accessible, research-based screening and intervention Web site can attract many users, most of whom are drinking excessively, and many of whom avail themselves of referral information after receiving individualized feedback. ~ 2004 The Institute For Cancer Prevention and Elsevier Inc.

Active screening followed by intervention can improve patient outcomes for problem drinkers, and improve access to specialty treatment for those with dependence [3,10]. De\u00ad spite these available options, many people remain uniden\u00ad tified and untreated [11,12]. Most screening and brief intervention programs have been designed for health care settings, usually paper and pencil questionnaires or in-person interviews [3]. Web-based measures of alcohol use appear to be at least as reliable as these older methods [13]. Using the Internet for screening has the potential to greatly increase the number of people screened and improve access to brief intervention. More than half of all U.S. adults use the Internet and more than half of these Internet users search for health information online (77 million people); 8% ofIntemet users (9 million people), 14% of young adult Internet users (18- 29 years old), and 7% of middle-aged adult users (30-49 years old) have searched for information on alcohol or drug problems [14]. AlcoholScreening.org provides online self-assessment tools and health-based information to help individuals iden\u00ad tify their own risky drinking patterns or current alcohol problems. The site delivers personalized feedback and helps users locate assistance if they are ready to seek help. In this paper, we describe the development ofthe Web site designed to anonymously screen adults and provide personalized online feedback regarding alcohol use, and the feasibility of its use for alcohol screening on the Web. After creating and posting the Web site, we tested whether this Web site was used widely, whether it reached a target population of hazardous drinkers, and whether these persons would seek further assistance from the site when appropriate. Methods Web site design AlcoholScreening.org is an anonymous, free online self\u00ad screening service to assess an individual's alcohol consump\u00ad tion and its consequences. AlcoholScreening.org was based on the health belief model [15]. According to the core concepts of the health belief model, risky drinkers are more likely to reduce their alcohol consumption or otherwise control their at-risk behavior when they believe the threats are real, the benefits of change are valuable, and the barriers to behavioral changes are lessened. With these concepts in mind, AlcoholScreening.org was created as a vehicle to provide the user with personalized feedback speaking di\u00ad rectly to the issues of risks, benefits, and action steps. Additional features were created to provide supplemental information for Web site users wishing to take action. Visitors to this Web site answer 12 questions about their drinking and an additional question for research purposes, and are presented with results that outline the likelihood that their reported drinking patterns indicate risky or harmful alcohol consumption. Visitors may also access an online library ofhealth information about alcohol consumption and alcohol problems, search a national database of substance abuse treatment facilities, or follow links to additional information online. All users are presented with a disclaimer emphasizing that the Web site does not provide a medical diagnosis and cannot substitute for a full evaluation by a health professional. Visitors complete an online version of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) [16]. In addition to the 10 AUDIT questions, users are asked two additional questions to further detail the quantity and frequency of their alcohol consumption, and whether their responses reflect their personal alcohol consumption patterns. These questions read: \"Thinking about a typical week, on how many days do you have at least one alcoholic drink? (If you don't drink every week, answer for a typical week in which you do)\"; \"Thinking about the past year, what is the greatest number of drinks you've had on anyone occasion?\"; and \"Optional: This question is for research purposes only: I am completing this test based upon my own alcohol-use experience OR I am just curious about the test and the related feedback, or answered the questions with someone else in mind.\" Upon completion of the online screening test, users receive nonjudgmental feedback based on their AUDIT score [J 7], the current U.S. Department of Agriculture Dietary guidelines for moderate alcohol consumption [18], and U.S. alcohol consumption norms [19]. Feedback is based on the principles of successful brief interventions [20] and distinguishes between drinking amounts that place people at risk for future consequences, and drinking with consequences that have already occurred [21,22]. All users are advised whether their screening results indicate a like\u00ad lihood of hazardous or harmful alcohol consumption, and all are informed about current guidelines for low-risk drinking. In addition, links are provided to alcohol and health infor\u00ad mation, and the site provides the option of searching a national database of substance abuse treatment facilities for local, in-person assistance. A traffic light theme is graph\u00ad ically incorporated into the site to help illustrate the screen\u00ad ing results. Users scoring below eight on the AUDIT and whose alcohol consumption falls within the U.S. Dietary guidelines for moderate alcohol consumption are presented with a \"green light\" results page. They are told that their alcohol consumption appears to fall within healthy limits, but are warned that there are certain circumstances when any amount of alcohol may not be safe, for example, when operating a vehicle or machinery, while pregnant, or if certain medical conditions exist. 971 R. Saitz et al. / Preventive Medicine 39 (2004) 969-975 Those scoring below eight on the AUDIT, but who exceed the U.S. Dietary guidelines for weekly or per-occasion alcohol consumption see a \"yellow light\" results page. They are told that while their results do not suggest that a pattern of excess drinking is currently harming their health, the amount they reported consuming on at least one occasion increases their risk for injury or other immediate consequences, or that the amount they reported consuming per week places them at risk for future, mainly chronic, health consequences. They are encouraged to cut down, abstain, or set a safer personal limit for how much alcohol they consume, and, as in the \"green light\" scenario, are reminded that for some people and in certain situations, no amount of alcohol is safe. In addition, those who exceed weekly alcohol consumption guidelines receive normative information comparing their alcohol consumption to that of the general adult American population and to the adult population of their gender. A sample of this information based on the data provided by a user is: \"More than 95% of the general adult American population, and 91% of men consume fewer drinks per week than you reported consuming.\" Users scoring eight or above on the AUDIT are pre\u00ad 'sented with a \"red light,\" and are told that likely their current drinking is hazardous or harmful to their health and well being. This group also receives normative feedback comparing their alcohol consumption to that of the general adult American population and to the adult population of their gender. They are told that the AUDIT cannot diagnose any condition or tell them for certain if alcohol use is harming their health, and are advised to seek further evaluation from their doctor or other qualified health professional. At any time, users can follow links to a national alcohol treatment facility database and information on alcohol and health. The treatment database is a current copy ofa data set maintained by the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) of the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Further information on alcohol and health is republished by AlcoholScreenin\u00ad g.org and provided by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (U.S. Department of Agriculture and the SAMHSA Center for Substance Abuse Prevention) and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) [18,23,24].

In May 2001, it was featured on hundreds of commercial Web sites in a month-long na\u00ad tional banner-ad public service campaign through the DoubleClick advertising network, and received donated banner ad placement on the Boston Globe Web site.

Printed flyers (34,000) were distributed to the public through state and local health departments, alcohol treatment providers, and recovery organizations throughout the United States, and also to every employee of a major U.S. airline through May 2002. The site receives hundreds of daily referrals from Intemet search engines (e.g., google.com). Data collection Data are collected anonymously by the Web site and cannot be traced to any identifiable individuals. Users are asked to provide their age and gender, but no further personal information is solicited. The responses to all screening questions are recorded to a secure database, as are the results. of the real-time computer scoring that determines which feedback module is presented to the user. If, after viewing their screening feedback, a user immediately accesses either the \"Learn More\" or \"Find Help\" sections, their choice is recorded and associated with the screening responses and results. The user's age, gender, screening responses and results, and choice to access the \"Learn More\" or \"Find Help\" sections are linked with a record number and stored on a secure password-protected server. The study of Web site use was approved by the Institu\u00ad tional Review Board at Boston University Medical Center. In addition to recording and reporting herein counts of Web site visits, page views, and completed AUDIT screening tests, we describe a sample of data entered by users between April 2, 2001, and June 2,2002. These data were entered by users who reported they were adults 18 years or older and who completed the questionnaire. From this description, we excluded Web users who stated that they were \"just curious\" or that they were answering the questions for someone else. Results are reported as descriptive statistics (means and standard deviations, proportions), and the chi-square test and t test were used as appropriate for bivariable analyses. We used analysis of variance and Duncan's multiple range test using P> 0.05 as the level of statistical significance to compare mean age across three drinking levels. For de\u00ad scriptive purposes, we defined hazardous drinking amounts consistent with NIAAA and U.S. Department of Agricul\u00ad ture recommendations: >14 standard U.S. drinks (13.7 g ethanol) per week for men; >7 drinks per week for women and those 65 years or older; or >4 drinks per occasion for men, >3 drinks for women. We defined those receiving an AUDIT score of 28 as \"possible alcohol abuse or depen\u00ad dence,\" those receiving AUDIT scores <8 but exceeding consumption guidelines as \"drinking hazardous amounts,\" and those with AUDIT scores <8 but not exceeding consumption guidelines as \"nonhazardous drinkers.\" Drinkers with AUDIT scores of 8 or greater or drinkers of hazardous amounts when referred to together are called \"hazardous drinkers.\" 972 R. Saitz et ai. I Preventive Medicine 39 (2004) 969-975 Results Web site use From April 2001 to May 2003, AlcoholScreening.org received 251,170 visits (115,925/year), with the users spend\u00ad ing an average 5 min and 25 s on the site, and yielding 109,874 completed alcohol-screening questionnaires (50,711/year). The total number of completed questionnaires as of May 16, 2004, was 180,123 in 422,324 visits. Characteristics of Web site users During our study period, April 2, 2001, to June 2,2002, 66 548 users visited the site and began completing the oniine screening; 4,418 did not complete the screening questionnaire; 21,542 questionnaires were completed by users who stated that they were just curious about the test and related feedback or answered the questions with some\u00ad one else in mind. Of the remaining 40,588 completed questionnaires, 746 users identified themselves as children under age 18 years of age or age 99 or older, and were excluded from further description or analysis. This resulted in 39,842 (35,150/year) valid questionnaires from adults (60% of adult Web site visitors) for analysis. Of the 39,842 adults completing the screening question\u00ad naire, the mean age was 32 (\u00b1SD II) (range 18-98). Two\u00ad thirds of them were men, and 33% were women. Almost all users were drinking hazardous amounts (35,904/39,842, 90% [95% these hazardous drinkers (9,983/ 35,904) had AUDIT scores <8. More than half of the Web site visitors (21,922/39,842, 55% [95% CI 55-56%]) reported drinking hazardous amounts during a typical week.

Two-thirds of adults (25,921139,842, 65% [65-66%]) had AUDIT scores of 8 or greater (possible alcohol abuse or dependence) (see Table 2). Women were significantly less likely to have scores greater than or equal to 8 (57% [95% CI 18,365126,607] of men, P < 0.0001) (see Table 3). The median AUDIT score was 10, the score at the 75th percen\u00ad tile was 16, and at the 90th percentile was 23.

Saltz et al. / Preventive Medicine 39 (2004) 969-975 Web site visitors with possible alcohol abuse or depen\u00ad dence were significantly younger (mean age 30.9) and more likely to be male (71%) than those drinking hazardous amounts but with AUDIT scores less than 8 (mean 33.6 years, 58% male), and nonhazardous drinkers (mean 39.0 years, 62% male) (P < 0;0001). Men were more likely than women to have possible alcohol abuse or dependence, though the absolute difference was small (88% vs. 84%, OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.36-1.57). Excluding those with possible alcohol abuse or dependence (e.g., those with AUDIT scores 8 or greater), women were slightly more likely to drink hazardous amounts than men (odds ratio 1.21, 95% confidence interval 1.12-1.30). Web site use after feedback was delivered Almost one-fifth of the study sample (7,513/39,842, 18.9% the \"Learn More\" or \"Get Help\" options after receiving their results. Users with possible alcohol abuse or dependence (21.4% [95% CI 20.9-21.9%], 5,569125,921) were more likely than users drinking hazardous amounts (15.8% [95% CI 15.1-16.5%], 1,573/9,983), who were More\" or \"Get Help\" options after they were presented with feedback on their drinking (Mantel-Haenszel Chi-Square test for trend P < 0.0001). Furthermore, ofthose who clicked further after getting feedback, choices were consistent with alcohol use severity: one-third (l,837/5,569, 32.9% [95% CI 31.7 - 34.1%]) possible abuse or dependence selected \"Get Help\" instead of leam more, while only 8% (95% CI 6.8-9.2%, 15911,944) of site users with AUDIT scores <8 did so (P < 0.0001). Discussion Creating and widely promoting a Web site for alcohol screening and brief intervention resulted in a significant number of Internet users visiting the site. A majority of visitors completed questionnaires and most questionnaire completers reported they were answering questions about their own drinking. Almost all reported drinking hazardous amounts, or possible alcohol abuse or dependence (AUDIT ;;:: 8). What may be most remarkable about the characteristics of users of this Web site is the large proportion of women drinkers who are drinking hazardous amounts. While lower than the proportion ofmale hazardous drinkers in the sample, the prevalence ofmale hazardous drinkers was only between one and two times that of females, unlike the up to fivefold difference in hazardous drinking identified in men vs. women in primary care settings [4]. And the proportion of women drinking hazardous weekly amounts was higher than that for men. Use of the site was internally consistent: Web users reporting more severe problems were more likely to proceed to screens that offered more information and help. The site was feasible for screening many adults and Web site users were primarily hazardous drinkers, suggesting the possibility of reaching many people, particularly women, who otherwise might not have hazardous drinking identified or addressed. Internet-based alcohol assessment and feedback has been reported previously. Cunningham et al. [26] posted an anonymous 21-item survey (AUDIT, typical week con\u00ad sumption over the past year, consequences) and materials modified from the Drinker's Check-up. Cunningham'S Web address (\"Try Our Free Drinking Evaluation\" at http:// notes.camh.net/efeed.nsf/newform) was not designed for widespread easy access though the title of the site may have garnered a number of visits. Furthermore, few of the visits generated completed questionnaires (214 of 1,729 completed questionnaires were by Web users who answered questions about their own drinking). Compared with more frequent and more consistent drinkers, less frequent drinkers and drinkers whose consumption varied a great deal over time found that the feedback given by the site was less credible. Another site, CareBetter.com, included a 43-item questionnaire followed by personalized feedback. The Web address in this case was also not transparent nor was it likely to attract users interested in evaluating their alcohol use [27]. Approximately 20% of visitors to the site completed the questionnaire. During a 172-day period, the site screened just over 2,800 individuals (approximately 10% the rate in the current study). Similar to our study, the prevalence of likely alcohol problems among completers of the questionnaires was high (89% with AUDIT 2 8). AlcoholScreening.org can also be compared to another effort to screen general populations, National Alcohol Screening Day [28]. On this day implemented each year since 1999, individuals at community (e.g., hospitals and shopping malls) and primary health care sites and colleges screen volunteers. The day is widely promoted, and con\u00ad ducted nationwide. In community and college screenings, the AUDIT is used as the screening tool. Most of the screening activity occurs on the designated day, and almost all during the week containing that day. In 1999 at 1,089 sites, 18,043 people were screened, 43% had AUDIT scores of 8 or greater (compared with 65% of AlcohotScreenin\u00ad g.org visitors), and 5,949 were referred for treatment. In 2002, the program screened almost 45,000 people at 2,863 sites; 12,000 were hazardous drinkers (27% vs. 90% of AlcoholScreening.org visitors) [29]. Web approaches and a national screening day rely on volunteers to seek the screening. As such, the proportion of those screened who have the target condition are relatively high compared with, for example, universal screening in general healthcare settings [30,31]. But many people screened online and at national screening events are either not having regular contact with healthcare settings or are having such contact and not being identified [27,28J. Thus Web-based screening and in-person screens are likely com\u00ad plementary and address problems in different populations. 974 R. Soia et al. / Preventive Medicine 39 (2004) 969-975 Furthermore, individuals identified by in-person screening could be referred to use Web-based screening, intervention, and informational materials among other referral resources. There are limitations to this evaluation of AlcoholScree\u00ad ning.org. First,because ofconcernsabout confidentiality and our interest in seeing the feasibility of a truly anonymous screening program, we could not identify unique users of the site nor could we confirm self-reports. As a result, we may have overestimated the number of individual users because individuals may have visited the site more than once and been COWlted as new users. In addition, when assessing use of the Web site functions that provided more information and referral resources, we only counted users who proceeded to these parts ofthe site immediately after completed screening because that was the only way to be certain that the screened individual was seeking information. As a result, we may have underestimatedthenumber ofWebsiteusers whosoughthelp and information, as individuals may have returned during a separate Web session for this purpose. Conclusions regarding thecharacteristics ofsubjectsinthesample (e.g., age,gender, alcohol use, response to feedback) should be limited to Internet users who seek and use an alcohol screening Web site. Findings may not generalize to older adults, and to populations known to use the Internet less to seek health information and less in general (e.g., lower income or education level, those without high-speed Internet connec\u00ad tions) [14]. Finally, we were not able to assess clinical outcomes in this initial evaluation of this new technology. Despite these limitations, we can conclude that the Web site was designed based on known valid screening approaches and included research-based intervention com\u00ad ponents, it was used extensively, and high proportions of users completed the screening. Its extensive use was likely related to concerted efforts to publicize the site, including an easily identifiable Web address recognized by common search engines. Although screening tests are brief and valid, and profes\u00ad sional interventions for hazardous drinking and alcohol abuse and dependence are available, many people do not avail themselves of such services [4,6]. Screening in health\u00ad care settings is widely recommended by professional soci\u00ad eties but screening and intervention are often not performed [30,32,33]. Some have recently suggested that screening for alcohol problems in primary care settings is inefficient and have questioned whether the effort of screening is worth\u00ad while [31]. Most American Internet users search for health information on the Web and 9 million have searched for alcohol and drug information [14]. In a recent telephone survey, current drinkers chose computerized normative feedback more often than other options (therapist phone call, self-help book) for addressing their alcohol use [34]. Web-based assessments appear to be reliable [13]. But perhaps more importantly, they hold the promise ofreaching many individuals who would otherwise receive no informa\u00ad tion or intervention. One could speculate that if these adults are similar to those seeking alcohol information at Alcohol\u00adScreening.org, 8.1 million hazardous drinkers (90% of 9 million) could be screened and receive feedback; a Web\u00ad based brief intervention, if as effective as in-person inter\u00ad ventions, could decrease the number of hazardous drinkers by 850,000 (absolute risk reduction 10.5%) [31]. This speculation clearly goes beyond data presented herein, and points to topics for further research. Our data suggest that Web-based screening and inter\u00ad vention can reach many people at low cost. Web site creation and maintenance cost $9,500, and advertising $9,000. Good search engine placement and free media coverage were the primary means of attracting visitors to the site. The volume of visitors assured high level place\u00ad ment in Google and other search engines. In addition, even a minimally effective intervention would have a large public health impact. Additional studies should explore the potential to reach all Internet users seeking alcohol and drug information, and should test the efficacy on drinking and other outcomes. AlcoholScreening.org is a Web site that has a URL (Web address) with a clear message, it has been widely publicized., and it garners internally consistent responses from site visitors. The site has attracted more visitors than any other alcohol screening intervention Web site to date and it has attracted more visitors per year than a compa\u00ad rable in-person effort, National Alcohol Screening Day. The site has features that make Web-based screening and intervention an important addition to the public health tools available for addressing hazardous drinking: It is anonymous, accessible at any time from anywhere there is Web access, and requires minimal professional staff (and professional contact with users). Hazardous drinkers, par\u00ad ticularly women, seek information and feedback at the site. Further research should focus on additional development of Web-based interventions, outcome evaluations using rigorous research designs, cost-effectiveness of various approaches to mass screening for alcohol problems, and research to identify the most appropriate role for Web screening (e.g., how to integrate with health professional care and other efforts such as mass in person screening). Until such results are available, Web sites such as Alcohol\u00ad Screening.org can be recommended to supplement public health efforts aimed at reducing excessive alcohol use and related problems.

Receipt of primary medical care was assessed over 2 years. Outcomes included (1) alcohol severity, (2) drug severity and (3) any substance use. Findings For the 391 subjects. receipt of primary care (;<:2 visits) was associ\u00ad ated with a lower odds of drug use or alcohol intoxication (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.45. 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29-0.69. 2 dJ. X2 P = 0.002). For 248 subjects with alcohol as a substance of choice, alcohol severity was lower in those who received primary care [predicted mean Addiction Severity Index (ASI) alcohol scores for those reporting ;<:2. 1 and 0 visits. respectively. 0.30, 0.26 and 0.34, P=O.()4]. For 300 subjects with heroin or cocaine as a sub\u00ad stance of choice, drug severity was lower in those who received primary care (predicted mean ASI drug scores for those reporting <:2. 1 and a visits, respec\u00ad tively. 0.13. 0.15 and 0.16. P= 0.01). Conclusions Receipt of primary medical care is associated with improved addiction severity.These results support efforts to link patients with addictions to primary medical care services. KEYWORDS Health services, primary care. severity of illness. substance abuse. INTRODUCTION Alcohol and drug abuse cost the United States $328 bil\u00ad lion a year. more than heart disease or cancer [1-3]. Effi\u00ad cacious treatments for adults with addictions exist. yet many do not seek treatment [4.5]' Those seeking treat\u00ad ment may find barriers such as limited access and unco\u00ad ordinated systems of care [6]. Thus. most patients who undergo detoxification do not [ink with addiction treat\u00ad ment to prevent relapse of this chronic illness [7]. There is great potential benefit to patients and provid\u00ad ers for linking the addiction specialty treatment system with primary medical care [6]. Proven effective interven\u00ad tions for alcohol and drug problems can be delivered in primary care settings. such as screening. brief interven\u00ad tion and referral, relapse prevention and coordination of multiple specialty services (e.g. mental health. substance abuse, medical and social services) [6.8.9]; yet these sys\u00ad tems of care typically remain unlinked and potential ben\u00ad efits do not accrue. \u00a9 2005 Society for the Study of Addiction doi:l0.llll/j.ll60-044 .l.2004.()()'i16.x Addiction. 100. 70-78 Nevertheless. several studies have demonstrated that integrating primary medical care and addiction treat\u00ad ment realizes actual benefits, in particular for addiction outcomes [10,11]. While these studies of on-site care suggest benefit they are not conclusive, and furthermore they address a system of care that is currently not widely available. nor likely to be in the future given that it would require major changes in our health-care delivery systems. Linkage of patients with addictions to primary care as it currently exists (in a distributive system of linkage/ integration [12]) holds the promise of impact on addic\u00ad tion outcomes. Lessimpact might be expected from a dis\u00ad tributive system than of a primary care intervention at an addiction treatment program. although distributive link\u00ad age. by using existing systems of care, would also proba\u00ad bly be less costly. With tailored interventions. patients with addictions who do not have regular medical care can be linked successfully with primary care from the addiction treatment system [13]. Despite the promise of benefits, the clinical impact of this linkage model with pri\u00ad mary care in the community remains largely unknown. As a clinical trial randomizing adults to receive or not receive primary care is unlikely to be conducted. we assessed the impact of receipt of primary medical care on addiction severity and substance usc in a prospective cohort of subjects with no primary medical care. METHODS Subjects and design Subjects were participants in a study of a multi-disciplin\u00ad ary assessment and brief motivational intervention to link adults with addictions in a residential detoxification unit. who had no primary care physician, with primary medical care. The details of the randomized trial have been published [13]. Briefly, after the acute symptoms of withdrawal had resolved, eligible subjects were enrolled and provided written informed consent. Eligible subjects were adults who spoke Spanish or English. reported alco\u00ad hol, heroin or cocaine as their first or second drug of choice. and resided in proximity to the primary care clinic to which they would be referred. or were homeless. Patients with established primary care relationships they planned to continue, significant dementia, specific plans to leave the Boston area that would prevent research par\u00ad ticipation. failure to provide contact information for tracking purposes, or pregnancy were excluded. The clin\u00ad ical trial intervention was associated significantly with increased primary care linkage [13]. However, a substan\u00ad tial proportion of intervention subjects did not link with primary care (31%); and a substantial proportion of <02005 Society fur the Study of Addiction Primarymedicalcareandaddiction severity 71 control subjects did link (53%) during the first 12 months of follow-up. Thus, the clinical trial intention-to-treat analysis was not informative regarding the impact of pri\u00ad mary medical care on clinical outcomes. This report is not the 'treatment received' analysis of that randomized trial; rather. this prospective study focuses on the impact of exposure to what was the outcome (l.e, receipt of pri\u00ad mary medical care) of the clinical trial and takes advan\u00ad tage of the prospective data collection. Subjects were interviewed at baseline during their detoxification stay and completed up to 4 bi-annual follow-up interviews over 2 years. The current study was restricted to a prospectively enrolled and followed cohort of these trial participants who completed at least one of four scheduled research follow-up encounters, 85% (400/468) of those enrolled in the trial and alive at first follow-up opportunity. There were no statistically signifi\u00ad cant differences in subject characteristics listed below between those who entered the trial and completed ver\u00ad sus those who did not complete any research follow-up observations except for race. Of those with follow-up, 54% were white but of those lost, 34% were white. The Institutional Review Board of Boston University Medical Center approved this study. Additional privacy protec\u00ad tion was secured by the issuance of a Certificate of Confi\u00ad dentiality by the Department of Health and Human Services. Assessments After initial resolution of the symptoms of acute with\u00ad drawal. trained research associates interviewed subjects at the detoxification unit. Assessments included: demo\u00ad graphics, substance of choice, substances used and addic\u00ad tion severity [Addiction Severity Index (ASI)alcohol and problems [Inventory of Drug UseConsequences (InDUC-2R)] [15]. readiness to change substance use [using the Stages of Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale (SOCRATES 8AOD)] [16]. health-related quality of life [Short Form Health Survey (SF-36)] [17], self-report of attendance at mutual help groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous, and questions regarding primary medical care [13]. Except for demo\u00ad graphics, all the assessments were repeated at follow-up interviews. At follow-up interviews, alcohol breath tests were performed to encourage truth telling [18]. Receipt of primary medical care was assessed during follow-up interviews using the following questions: 'Is there one particular doctor that you consider to be your regular personal doctor?'; 'Have you seen any doctors in the last 6 months (or since your last interview)?' If they did not report having a regular personal doctor but had seen a physician, they were asked: 'Would you call or go tooneofthese/this doetor(s)ifyouhad amedicalproblem Addict;on, 100. 70-78 72 Richard Saitz et al. that was not an emergency?'; 'Do you think one of these doctors could be your regular doctor?'. Subjects reporting either having or possibly having a regular personal doctor or that they would contact the doctor for non\u00ad emergent problems were asked 'What type of doctor is your regular personal/this doctor?' While we could not assess directly the validity of self\u00ad report, we did compare self-report with administrative data sources. Computerized databases of patients seen for primary medical care at Boston Medical Center (BMC) or by Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program were queried for visits by study subjects during all-month period following study enrollment. This database included all visits to the two BMC-based primary care practices (>120 physicians and >70 000 visits per year), and all visits to primary health-care delivery sites for the homeless at BMC or in a city-wide network for the home\u00ad less. While subjects in the randomized trial intervention group were usually referred to care at BMC, all subjects in the cohort could pursue primary medical care anywhere. These administrative data were obtained for 95% of study subjects. Among subjects with any self-report data that were determined by administrative data to have linked, 81 % (103/127) reported linkage (kappa=OA1). We also identified 100% of study subjects by means of substance abuse treatment utilization data obtained from the Treatment Management Information System, which is maintained by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) Bureau of Substance Abuse Services (BSAS). These data were provided under an agreement between Boston Medical Center and the BSAS. This data set includes all episodes of substance abuse treatment uti\u00ad lization that occur at programs receiving state funding for addiction treatment, regardless of whether a particu\u00ad lar treatment episode was paid for by the state. Treatment utilization was assessed for 6 months prior to study enrollment and 24 months afterwards. Predictor variables The main predictor variable was receipt of primary med\u00ad ical care. Receipt of primary care since the last research contact was defined as a visit to a primary care physician, nurse practitioner or physician assistant reported at a fol\u00ad low-up interview. For the visit to be defined as primary care, the subject had to report having a 'regular personal doctor', that they would call that doctor for a non-emer\u00ad gent issue or that they saw a doctor who 'could be their regular personal doctor'. In addition. that clinician had to be in a specialty that could be considered primary care, including obstetrics and gynecology, family medicine, pediatrics, adolescent medicine, internal medicine, AIDS doctor, asthma doctor, pulmonary doctor, cardiologist or a gastroenterologist. When the specialty was unknown to \u00a9 200.5 Society for the Study of Addiction the subject or was a specialty other than those specifically queried, the physician's officewas contacted to determine the specialty. Examples of specialties that were classified as non-primary care clinicians were podiatrists, emer\u00ad gency medicine physicians and psychiatrists. Because of its right-skewed distribution. we categorized primary care receipt for analyses as 0, 1 or 2 or more visits to avoid undue influence of outliers on the analysis. For a second\u00ad ary sensitivity analysis to explore further dose-response. primary care receipt was categorized as a variable with eight levels (0, 1, 2, 3,4, 5, 6 or 7 or more visits). Additional predictor variables of interest included the following: demographics, homelessness (defined as one or more nights in a shelter or on the street in the preceding 6 months), addiction severity (the alcohol and drug ASI scores at study entry), attendance at mutual help meet\u00ad ings, the physical and mental component summary scores derived from the SF-36 [19] and the Taking Steps scale score from the SOCRATES. Substance abuse treat\u00ad ment utilization was a dichotomous variable of interest. This treatment variable represented any treatment, not known effective doses. The following BSAS services were considered treatment: transitional support services, recovery homes, therapeutic communities, supportive housing, residential treatment, family substance abuse shelters, day treatment, out-patient substance abuse counseling, methadone treatment, community-based case management, acupuncture, intensive out-patient treatment and postdetox recovery programs [20]. Outcome variables Addiction severity was the primary outcome of interest. The alcohol and drugASI composite scores (ranging from oto 1), and any drug use or alcohol use to intoxication (or more than three drinks in a day) (a dichotomous vari\u00ad able) were the main outcome variables. This latter vari\u00ad able was based on questions on substance use in the AS!, regarding the most recent 30 days. A secondary analysis was conducted using substance\u00ad related problems as the dependent variable, as measured using the InDUC-2R covering a 6-month time frame (score range 0-135 l21], median of 73 observed prevl\u00ad ously for men entering drug abuse treatment [15]). Sub\u00ad stance abuse treatment utilization (described above) was an additional outcome variable of interest. as a possible measure of impact of primary care linkage. Subject characteristics Of the 400 subjects eligible for this prospective cohort study, nine did not have complete data and were excluded. All subjects were interviewed at study entry: an additional 975 interviews occurred during the 2 years Addiction. J00. 70-78 after the initial interview. Of the nine subjects excluded. one was missing addiction outcome measures. five were missing addiction severity measures at study entry and three were missing homelessness. insurance and health\u00ad related quality of lifedata (as they completed abbreviated follow-up interviews that did not reassess these items). None were missing primary care receipt information. Subject characteristics were similar regardless of drug of choice. Of the 391 subjects. 76% were male. mean age was 36. 50% were African American. 9% Hispanic and 60% had no health insurance; 57% of subjects with alco\u00ad hol as a drug of choice were homeless. 43% of subjects with another drug as a substance of choice were home\u00ad less. The mean SF-36 Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores were 48 and 31, respectively (the mean MCS and PCS scoreforthe US population of 30-34 screen positivefordepression [1911. The mean ASI alcohol and drug scores were 0.47 and 0.26. respectively (these ASIscores are similar to those of indi\u00ad viduals entering the public treatment system in Boston and more severe than those in a clinical addiction treat\u00ad ment sample in an HMOin California [22.23]). Subjects reporting alcohol as a drug of choice had a higher mean ASI alcohol score (0.66. SD 0.25); subjects reporting another drug as a substance of choice had a higher mean ASIdrug score (0.31.

The mean Taking Steps scale score reflecting greater readiness to address addic\u00ad tion problems with higher scores was 36 (the possible range of this readiness assessment measure is 8-40 with a median of 33 for patients in alcoholism treatment [16]). Subject characteristics were similar across drug of choice groups with the exception of drug and alcohol ASI com\u00ad posite scores. as would be expected. Analysis The analysis for this paper was generated using SAS/ STAT software. version 8.2 [24]. All study subjects were eligible for analyses of treatment utilization and sub\u00ad stance use. Analyses of alcohol and drug addiction sever\u00ad ity were restricted to subjects who reported alcohol or another drug as their substance of choice. respectively. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the study sample (proportions. means and standard deviations). Reported P-values are two-tailed. and a P-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Esti\u00ad mates of time to first report of linkage with primary med\u00ad ical care or substance abuse treatment. where linkage could occur at 6. 12. 18 or 24 months. were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Subjects were censored after linkage or their last follow-up time. Wefitted longitudinal regression models adjusting for time and intrasubject correlations for all multi-variable I:J2005 Society for the Study of Addiction Primary medical care andaddiction severity 73 analyses [25]. For dichotomous outcome variables we used generalized estimating equations (GEE) imple\u00ad mented in PROC GENMOD. For the continuous outcome variables we used generalized linear models for correlated data (GLMCD) implemented using PROC MIXED. Each subject contributed up to four observations of the out\u00ad comevariables(from 6.12.18 and24 months afterstudy enrollment). An independent working correlation model and an empirical variance estimator were used for the GEE models. while an unstructured working covariance model was assumed for the GLMCD models. All analyses included covariates of clinical importance. Homelessness. health insuranc~. physical and mental health-related quality of life, readiness to change and addiction treat\u00ad ment. when included, were time-varying covariates. Other covariates were those assessed at study entry. We fitted three multi-variable models to address the primary research question. one for each primary out\u00ad come. We also fitted one model for the outcome of sub\u00ad stance abuse treatment. All analyses were adjusted for time, age. sex, race, randomized assignment in the clini\u00ad cal trial, hornelessness, health insurance, mental and physical health-related quality of life, alcohol and drug severity at study entry and readiness to change. Analyses with addiction severity and substance use as the outcome variables were also adjusted for substance abuse treat\u00ad ment and use of mutual help groups. Analyses with sub\u00ad stance abuse treatment and substance use as outcomes were adjusted for substance of choice. Secondary confirmatory/sensitivity analyses ad\u00ad dressed whether the results of the three main models and the substance abuse treatment model would differ when entering primary care as an eight-level variable. An additional analysis confirmed the results by testing the effect of primary care receipt on substance-related prob\u00ad lems, adjusting for the same covariates as in the models with substance use as the outcome. To address the possi\u00ad bility of higher-order effects, we added the following seven interactions with receipt of primary medical care to the three main models:alcohol anddrugseverityat study entry, mutual help use, readiness to change, physical health-related quality of life, randomization assignment and substance abuse treatment utilization. RESULTS Of 391 subjects, 194149.6%) received a total of twu or more primary care visits, 53 (13.5%) received a total of one visit and 144 (36.8\u00b0,.(,) received no primary medical care visits during the study period.

For all 391 subjects, regardless of substance of choice. receipt of primary care was associated signifi\u00ad cantly with a decreased odds of drug use or use of alcohol to intoxication (during 3a days) (Xl = 12.90, 2 d.f.. p==a.0016). During the 2 years of follow-up, 267 subjects (67.3%) received substance abuse treatment ser\u00ad vices (Kaplan-Meier estimates for each of the four successive 6-month periods 33.5%, 44.3%, 59.9%, 73.5%). In a multi-variable analysis, receipt of primary care was not significantly associated with receipt of sub\u00ad stance abuse treatment (Table1). Confirmatory/sensitivity analyses In multi-variable models entering the same covariates as the previously described models, an eight-level variable for receipt of primary care was associated with lower alcohol severity at a borderline level of significance (decrease in alcohol severity score for additional visit -0.009,95% CI-0.020-0.001, Fl.l39 =2.88, P== 0.09), was significantly associated with improved drug severity (decrease in drug severity for additionaL visit, -0.006, 95% CI -0.010 to -0.001.

Of these 21 interactions tested. only one was significant at P < 0.05. the interaction with physical health-related quality of life in the model predicting drug use severity (Table 2)(Fl m = 3.53. p=0.03). The association between primary care receipt and drug use severity var\u00ad ied by physical health-related quality of life. Predicted mean differences in drug severity were similar regardless of primary care receipt for those with better health (higher Pf'S]. Primary care appeared to have a greater impact on drug severity in people with worse physical health status (lower PCS scores). than it did on people with better health status. At the observed mean PCS of 48. and at 2 standard errors abovethis mean (70). there was little difference in the decreases in ASI drug score attributable to receipt of primary care. CONCLUSIONS Receipt of primary medical care in a distributive model by adults with addictions who have not recently had such care is associated with reduced problems and severity of addictions over a 24-month period. This asso\u00ad ciation does not appear to be mediated by exposure to substance abuse treatment. nor does it appear to be Primary medical care andaddiction severity 75 affected by addiction severity. mutual help use or readi\u00ad ness to change. As might be expected, primary care had a greater impact on addiction severity in patients with worse physical health. However. given the numerous interactions tested and the appearance of the finding for subjects with only cocaine or heroin as a substance of choice, these latter findings should be viewed as hypoth\u00ad esis generating. Analyses suggest some evidence for dose-response. both those that tested levels of primary care exposure and the ordered results from all other models (l.e. more effect from :2:2 visits versus 1. and 1 versus 0 visits). In the analysis of alcohol ASI results were not ordered according to primary care dose. but the one-visit group was substantially smaller than the 0- or ~2-visit groups. Our findings are consistent wtth prior studies. In a landmark randomized trial. substance abuse treatment patients receiving on-site medical. psychiatric. employ\u00ad ment and family services had less opiate use and im\u00ad proved medical. employment. legal and psychiatric outcomes [26]. In another randomized trial patients with substance abuse-related medical conditions as\u00ad signed to on-site primary care at an addiction treatment program were more likely to remain abstinent than patients in usual separate primary care [10]. In a retrospective cohort study patients with addictions treated at programs with on-site primary care had improved addiction outcomes when compared with patients treated in programs without such services [11]. Willenbring et a1. tested another variation of on-site medical and addictions care integration [27]. In a ran\u00ad domized trial in a special alcohol clinic for veterans. the integrated care group was more likely to be abstinent than a usual care group [28]. Laine etal. found that patients with addictions who receive both regular addic\u00ad tion and medical (not necessarily primary) care arc less likely to be hospitalized than those who received one or neither service [29]. Thus. medical care in general. and primary care specifically. appears to improve addiction outcomes. Our study adds to this literature by suggesting that these results are also true for primary medical care as it is delivered in the community to a group of patients with addictions that include many without homes or Table 2 Predicted mean differences in drug addiction severity by receipt of pri\u00adPredicted mellndifferences in drug addiction severity mary care for three values of physical health-related quality of life (sample Sample mean \u00ad2 SB Samplemean Sample mean + 2 Sf: mean 48. and 2 standard errors above and below).

In fact. it is people who are socially disadvantaged who may be most likely to benefit from primary medical care. Laine et al.\u00ab population, who received benefit from regular care, were insured by Med\u00ad icaid (state health insurance for the poor or disabled) [29]. Gelberg et al. have noted previously that in a vul\u00ad nerable population, more severe addictions and more severe homelessness did not deter access to needed care, and that having a regular source of care predicted better health outcomes [30]. The observation that substance abuse treatment did not appear to mediate the relation\u00ad ship between primary care and improved addiction severity is not surprising. Linkage between primary care and the addiction treatment system has been elusive [6]. Most patients with addictions do not seek specialty treatment [5] and substance abuse treatment has been notably not associated with linkage to primary medical care [31]. This absence of apparent contribution of sub\u00ad stance abuse treatment to the observed benefit of pri\u00ad mary care to addictions outcomes could be viewed as both a cup half empty and half full. Primary care may be contributing independently to improved addictions outcome. In addition. the opportunity to achieve even greater benefit may exist if mechanisms were instituted to link primary care more effectively with substance abuse treatment. The principal limitation that should be considered in interpreting our results is that our data are from an observational study. As a result. the observed associa\u00ad tions between receipt of primary care and addiction severity could be due to confounding. However. we adjusted for likely confounders of this relation. Further\u00ad more, the fact that data for this observational study were collected prospectivelyin a study focused on primary care and addictions is a particular strength. One might also question whether primary care led to reduced addiction severity. or whether adults with improved addictions became health conscious and linked with primary care. Another similar possibility is that those with the most severe problems who 'hit rock bottom' began to take care of themselves. including a visit to primary care and absti\u00ad nence or less use. Both explanations seem less plausible because analyses adjusted for substance abuse conse\u00ad quences and health status. Furthermore, measures of . addiction severity referred to the recent past while measures of primary care receipt referred to the past 6 months or more, making the former more likely. The temporal association. the confirmation of a prior hypoth\u00ad esis, adjustment for important possible confounders and the consistency across outcomes suggest that receipt of primary care was associated wnth later improvements in addiction severity. Finally, some of the observed effects wererelativelysmall(e.g.differencesof 0.02 indrugASI). Our goal was not to determine clinical significance but !O 2fl05 Society for the Study of Addiction rather to identify an association. It is notable that an association between primary medical care and addiction severity was detectable at all, given the variability in sub\u00ad ject characteristics and the many other contributors to addiction severity. In fact, some effects were quite sub\u00ad stantial and clinically significant (e.g.>50% decrease in odds of substance use, large changes in InDUe problem score and alcohol ASI). The important question. of whether or not primary medical care as it is currently delivered in the commu\u00ad nity can improve addiction severity.isbest answered in a naturalistic study, and this highlights several important strengths of this study. First. the data collection in this cohort study was prospective. Secondly. two of the main purposes of the research assessments a priori were to assess primary medical care utilization and addiction severity in detail. Thirdly, multiple measures of addiction severity used in the study have been validated and results across these measures were consistent. Finally. receipt of primary care was corroborated by administra\u00ad tive data. One could still argue that our findings are due to inadequately addressed confounding or that the out\u00ad come (Le. addiction severity) leads to seeking primary medical care. Such a critical assessment might contend that the hypothesis. 'primary medical care leads to improved addiction severity'. can only be answered definitively by a randomized trial of primary care. Addressing these concerns optimally is difficult. as such a study will probably not be conducted. for pragmatic and ethical reasons. This study and previous studies support the conten\u00ad tion that receipt of primary care is associated with improved outcomes for adults with addictions. Our study results and those of others cited herein may be the best type of evidence to bring to address the question. This evi\u00ad dence suggests strongly that patients with addictions should receive primary medical care in addition to addic\u00ad tion treatment. Efforts to link andlor integrate primary medical care with addiction specialty care are worth\u00ad while. Patients with addictions can he linked with pri\u00ad mary medical care [13]. In addition. actually providing services known to be efficacious and feasible in primary care settings that are not currently in Widespread use could lead to even greater improvements for patients with addictions. How to make primary medical care truly accessible and actually used by adults with alcohol and other drug dependence remainsachallenge forresearch\u00ad ers and clinicians alike.

Addictions in Inpatient Detoxification: Room for Improvement Richard Saitz, Mary Jo Larson, Nicholas J. Horton, Michael Winter, and Jeffrey H. Samet Objective. To identify patient characteristics and health care experiences associated with primary care linkage after alcohol or drug detoxification. Data Sources/Study Setting. Primary data collected over two years. Subjects were adults without primary medical care, in an urban residential detoxification program. Study Design. A prospective cohort study in the context of a randomized trial of a linkage intervention, and an expansion of Medicaid benefits. Data CollectionlExtraction Methods. Data were collected by interview assessment of predisposing, enabling, and illness variables. Linkage was defined as self-report of at least one visit with a primary care clinician during follow-up. Principal Fmdings. Of400subjects,63 percentlinked with primarymedical enabling, andillnessvariables, women, thosewithno recentincarceration, thosewith supportfor abstinence by family or friends, and those who had visited a medical clinicor physician recently were significantly more likely to link with primary care. Those with health insurance during follow-up were also more likely to link. Recent mental health or addictions treatment utilization and health status were not associated with linkage. Conclusions. A substantial proportion of adults with addictions do not link with primary medical care. These data suggest that efforts could be focused on those least likely to link, that contacts with mental health and addictions treatment providers are underutilized opportunities for these efforts, and that health policy changes such as expanding health insurance benefits may improve entry of substance-dependent patients into primary medical care. Key Words. Primary care, addictions, health insurance, cohort, linkage Many patients with addictions do not receive primary medical care. For example, of persons entering addiction treatment in Boston, only 41 percent reported having a primary care physician (Saitz, Mulvey, and Samet 1997). Yet these patients have many acute and chronic medical illnesses, both related and unrelated to their addictions {DeAlba, Samet, and Saitz in Research 39:3 {fun\u00ab 2()(J4) 2003). They also tend to use more costly episodic care for medical needs, such as the emergency department (McGeary et al. 2000; French et al. 2000). To address this shortfall there have been calls to link substance abuse treatment with primary care (Morris 1995; Levin et al. 1993; Samet, Friedmann, Saitz 2001). But how to link these systems to benefit patients, and which patients . with addictions are at greatest risk of going without primary care, is unknown. In fact, several federal agencies have recently attempted to gather expertise and develop research agendas to answer these questions and have ongoing requests for research in this area (National Institute of Mental Health 2003). Primary care can lead to better health for many groups of patients (Starfield 1998). In a recent retrospective cohort study, adults with addiction who received regular primary medical care were less likely to be hospitalized (Laine et al. 2001). In another study, onsite primary care was associated with improved addiction severity (Friedmann et al. 2003). In a randomized clinical trial, adults with addiction and substance-abuse-related medical conditions randomized to receive primary medical care integrated with their addictions care were more likely to be abstinent (Weisner et al. 2001). These studies confirm some of the predicted benefits of linkage of persons with addictions to primary medical care (Levin et al. 1993; Schlenger et al. 1992; Samet, Saitz, and Larson 1996). Recently, new therapeutic options have been proven effective in primary care settings, such as naltrexone for alcoholism, and buprenorphine for office-based opioid dependence treatment (O'Connor Preliminary results were presented at the annual national meetings:of the Society of General Internal Medicine (SGIM) in May 2000 in Boston, at the College on Problems of Drug Dependence (CPDD) inJune 2000 in Sanjuan, Puerto Rico, and the Association for Medical Education and Research in Substance Abuse (AMERSA)in November 2000 InAlexandria, VA. This work was supported by a grant from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (ROI AA10870) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (ROI-DAlOOI9). Dr. Saitz was a Generalist Physician Faculty Scholar of the Robert WoodJohnson Foundation during the time this study was done. This work was supported in part by General Clinical Research Center grant no. MOl RROO533 from the National Center for Research Resources. --\", Richard Saitz, M.D., M.P.H., andJeffrey H.

Horton, Sc.D., is with the Department of Mathematics, Smith College, Northampton, MA Linkage with Primary Care 589 et al. 1998; O'Malley 2003). Other theoretical benefits are more efficient use of health services, opportunity for preventive health interventions, and better health. Some addiction treatment programs offer primary medical care onsite (Weisner et al. 2001). One study of integrated medical care for patients With alcoholism has even shown a mortality benefit (Willenbring and Olson 1999). But these integrated programs require Significant changes in existing systems. The more common pattern of organization of primary care and specialty addiction treatment services in the United States is no relationship, or a distributive one, rather than an integrative, onsite model. In the distributive pattern, medical and addictions care are delivered in separate locations, and patients and information are transferred from one location to another (Samet, Saitz, and Larson 1996). Yet this flow is anything but seamless (Samet, Friedmann, and Saitz 2001), since receipt of addictions care is not always associated with linkage to primary medical care (Saitz, Mulvey, and Samet 1997). In substance abuse programs opportunities to link patients with primary care are being missed. Because regular medical care has been shown to have benefits, the need to improve linkage ofaddicted persons with primarymedical care has become more urgent. A recent randomized trial found that an onsite multidisciplinary health evaluation, including motivational counseling, could increase linkage to primary medical care for adults with addictions and no regular physician (Samet et al. 2003). A greater understanding ofwhich patients with addictions are more or less likely to link with medical care would help target such interventions and help in the design of additional efforts to link patients with primarymedicalcare. Inaretrospective cross-sectional study ofpatientsenter\u00ad ing addiction treatment, those more likely to have primary medical care were older, female, had health insurance, and had medical illness (Saitz, Mulvey, and Samet 1997). The study was limited, however, due to an inability to distinguish the temporal relationship between risk factors and linkage and to characterize those who link to medical care after contact with the addiction treatment system. Factors associated with linkage to primary medical care may certainly be different in patients with addictions undergoing detoxifica\u00ad tion than they are for the general population or for patients with addictions who are not yet receiving any specialty care. And patients undergoing detoxification, many of whom contact the health care system only at detoxi\u00ad fication programs and emergency departments, are reachable and could potentially be connected with needed primary medical care, particularly if these efforts could be focused on those less likely to link without them. 590 HSR: Health Services Research 39:3 (june 2004) Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine, using a prospective design, characteristics and health care experiences of adults with addictions associated with linkage to primary medical care. We hypothesized that greater addiction severity and access barriers (e.g., lack of insurance, ethnicity, incarceration) would interfere with linkage to primary medical care' (Saitz, Mulvey, and Lincoln, and Tuthill 2000; Hargraves, Cunningham, and Hughes 2001). We also hypothesized that women, those recognizing their substftnce problem and having social support for recovery, those believing medical care was important, those with worse health status, and those who had prior contacts with addiction, episodic medical or mental health specialty care, would be more likely to link with primary medical care (Saitz, Mulvey, and Samet 1997; McCarthy et al. 2002; Diamant et al. 2001). METHODS Design The study was a prospective cohort. It was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Boston University Medical Center, and additional confidentiality protection was provided by a certificate of confidentiality provided by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. All subjects provided written informed consent Subjects All 2,062 adults admitted to and voluntarily staying at a free-standing urban residential alcohol and drug detoxification unit between June 1, 1997, and April 1, 1999, were screened for the study when research staff and patients were both available (Samet et al. 2003). They were screened for eligibility and enrolled on their second day or later in the detoxification unit Inclusion criteria were the following: (1) alcohol, heroin, or cocaine as the patient's first or second drug of choice; (2) age greater than ITyears; and (3)residence\"in proximity to a referral primary care clinic or homelessness. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) an established primary care relationship that the patient intended to continue (980 persons, 69 percent of those ineligible); (2) mental deficiencies making the subject unable to provide pertinent history or informed consent (score of less than 21 of 30 on the Mini-Mental State Examination) (Folstein, Folstein, and McHugh 1975); (3) specific plans to leave the area in the next 12 months; (4) inability to provide three contact Linlcage withPrimary Care 597 names for follow-up tracking; (5) pregnancy; and (6) not fluent in English or Spanish. Of 642 eligible subjects, 470 provided consent and were enrolled in the cohort. All 470 participated in the randomized clinical trial, the Health Evaluation and linkage to Primary care (HELP) study (Samet et al. 2003). All subjects were randomly assigned to receive either standard medical tare referralbyclinical addictions treatment staffonanas neededbasis(usualcare), or an enhanced effort for referral to primary medical care. This effort involved assessment by a physician, nurse, and social worker to address medical, psychological, and social issues, brief counseling by these providers trained in motivational interviewing to encourage primary care linkage, and making a specific appointment with a primary care physician and letters and phone calls to facilitate linkage (Samet et al. 2003). Neither option included ongoing primary medical care at the detoxification unit Assessments After initial resolution of the symptoms of acute withdrawal during the first 24 hours, subjects were interviewed at the detoxification unit by trained research associates. Assessments included demographics, health care utilization, social support, barriers to primary care linkage, beliefs about primary care, substances used, addiction severity (Addiction Severity Index [ASI] alcohol, drug, and psychological sub-scales) (McLellan et al. 1992), consequences of drug use (Inventory of Drug Use Consequences [INDUC-2L]) (Miller and Tonigan 1995),readiness to change substance use (usingthe Stages of Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale, [SaCRA TES 8AOD]) (Miller and Tonigan 1996), depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression [CES-D]scale)(Radloff 1977), health-related quality oflife (Short Form Health Survey [SF-36]) (Ware 1993),and questions regarding comorbid medical diagnoses (Stein et al. 1998; Saitz, Mulvey, and Samet 1997). Primary care linkage was determined by asking: \"Is there one particular doctor that you consider to be your regular personal doctor?\"; \"Have you seen any doctors in the last six months (or since your last interview)?\" Ifthey did not report having a regular personal doctor but had seen a physician, they were asked: \"Would you call or go to one of these/this doctor(s) ifyou had a medical problem that was not an emergency?\"; \"Do you think one of these doctors could be your regular doctor?\" Subjects reporting either having or possibly having a regular personal doctor or that they would contact the doctor for nonemergent problems were asked, \"What type of doctor is your regular personal/this doctor?\" 592 HSR: Health Services Research 39:3 {fune 2004) For these subjects being detoxified from substances, problem use of alcohol or other drugs was defined as either frequent use ( ~ 3 times per week) for a year or more, or 5 or more days of use in the past 30 days for any substances listed in the ASI. For this problem use definition, alcohol use was defined as either intoxication or three or more drinks on one day (McLellan . et al. 1992; Volpicelli et al. 1992). Outcomes Outcomes were assessed by in-person interview (phone as a secondary option) at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after baseline. Time to first self-reported linkage to primary medical care during the 24 months following study enrollment was the primary outcome of this cohort study (as well as of the randomized trial), where first linkage could occur at 6, 12, 18, or 24 months. Linkage to primary care was defined as at least one visit to a primary care physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant For the visit to be defined as primary care, the subject had to report having a \"regular personal doctor,\" that they would call this doctor for a nonemergent issue, or that they saw a doctor that \"could be their regular personal doctor.\" The clinician had to be in a specialty that could be considered primary care, including obstetrics and gynecology, family medicine, pediatrics, adolescent medicine, internal medicine, AIDS doctor, asthma doctor, pulmonary doctor, cardiologist, or a gastroenterologist When the specialty was unknown to the subject or was a specialty other than those specifically queried, the physician's office was contacted to determine the specialty. While we could not directly assess the validity of self-report, we did compare self-report with administrative data sources. Computerized data\u00ad bases of patients seen for primary medical care at Boston Medical Center (BMC) or by Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program were queried for visits by study subjects during a 12-month period following study enrollment This database included visits to the two BMC-based primary care practices (> 120 physicians and > 50,000 visits per year), and visits to primary health care delivery sites for the homeless at BMC or in a citywide network for the homeless. Whereas subjects in the randomized trial intervention group were usually referred to care at BMC, all subjects in the cohort could pursue primary medical care anywhere. Administrative data were obtained for 95 percent of study subjects. Among subjects with any self-report data that were determined by administrative data to have linked, 81 percent (103/127) reported linkage (Kappa = 0.41). Linkage with Primary Care 593 Independent Variables and Statistical Analysis Analyses used survival methods with time to event defined as the number of months between randomization and report of primary care linkage over the 24-month follow-up period. To aid in understanding the rate of linkage (accounting for censoring after linkage or last follow-up), we calculated annualized rates of linkage by dividing the number of linkage events by person-years of follow-up. Initial review of predictors of linkage was undertaken using stratified bivariable analysis. Multivariable proportional hazards regression models (Cox) were used to compare the hazard ratio for different predictor variables while accounting for other factors. We used the original theoretical framework provided by Andersen et al. to understand determinants of medical care utilization in the United States as guidance for analyses, as well as Gelberg et al.'s extension of this framework to include domains for vulnerable populations (Andersen 1995; Gelberg, Andersen, and Leake 2000; Andersen and Newman 1973). Specific vulnerable population variables were incarceration, perception of medical need (\"How important to you is treatment for medical problems,\" from the ASI), substance abuse problem recognition (SaCRA TES), and mental illness symptoms (CES-D, suicide attempt history, and psychiatric medication use). We also included one system variable: randomized group. We chose variables for entry into multivariable models based on review of the literature, clinical importance, bivariable analyses (using the log-rank test to determine statistical significance) using the liberal criterion p<0.20, and attention to conceptual overlap that could lead to collinearity (for example, health-related quality of life and report of a chronic medical illness). We then constructed multivariable models sequentially, in the order consistent with the theoretical framework. All models included age, gender, race, and randomi\u00ad zation assignment. The first model also included predisposing variables. The second model added enabling variables to those variables found to be signi\u00ad ficant at p< .20in the first model. Toassessthe effect ofavariable notcollected at baseline, the third model added health insurance as a time-variable predictor (same six-month time period as the report of linkage) to variables significant (p< .20) in Model 2. The final model included age, gender, race, randomization assignment, variables significant (p< .20) in prior models, and illness variables. All independent variables included in these models were those assessed at baseline except for the health insurance time-variable predictor. Because there could be disagreement among researchers as to whether a particular variable best belonged in a particular category, or with the 594 HSR: Health Services Research 39:3 [june2004) modeling strategy chosen, we entered all variables simultaneously and included them all in a multivariable model to assess the consistency of the findings. Predisposing variables considered in these models included age, gender, race, marital status, birthplace, recent incarceration (five years), firstlanguage, family or friends using drugs, and family or friends supporting abstinence .. Enabling variables included health insurance within six months prior to study enrollment, any visit to a medical clinic or private physician, or to an emergency department for medical care in the past six months, inability to.get a regular doctor due to transportation problems, fear that others mightfind out about their health problems as a barrier to connecting with a regular doctor, the belief that the individual did not need a regular physician, alcohol and drug problems as measured by the total score of the InDUC-2L, injection drug use ever, current smoking, readiness to change (SOCRATES recognition and taking steps scales), and problem use ofheroin, other opiates, and marijuana. Illness variables were physical health-related quality of life as measured by the SF-36 Physical Component Summary (PCS), the subject's belief that medical treatment is important, depressive symptoms (CES-D score), past suicide attempt or prescription of a medication for a psychiatric or emotional problem ever (from the ASI). Presence of any chronic medical illness replaced PCS as a dichotomous illness variable in a secondary analysis. To assess whether the association between these predictors and linkage varied by randomization group, we tested the interaction of each factor in the final model and randomization group in the HELP controlled trial, and repeated the multivariable model stratified by randomization group. Stratified results are presented only when relevant The Kaplan-Meier product limit estimator was used to estimate the unadjusted probability of linkage at a given time point (we chose 12 months, the midpoint offollow-up, to illustrate these proportions) for variables retained in the final model. Reported Jrvalues are two-tailed, and a Jrvalue ofless than 0.05 was considered statistically significant Analyses were carried out using SASlSTATsoftware (2001). RESULTS Of 470 subjects in the cohort, 2 died before follow-up and 400/468 (85 percent) completed at least one interview during the two-year follow-up period; there were 684 person-years of follow-up for the cohort. Subjects completed a mean of 17.5 months of follow-up (median 24 months). White Linkage with Primary Care 595 subjects were significantlyless likely to be lost to follow-up (34 percent versus 54 percent), while subjectswith family andfriends that used drugs (71 percent versus 84 percent), and who believed medical treatment to be important (40 percent versus 58 percent), were less likely to be lost Subjects lost to follow-up did not differ significantly by any other enabling, predisposing, or illness variable. Subject Characteristics (Table 1) Most ofthe470subjects were male, mean age was 36, andofthe 11 percent for whom English was not their first language, 58 percent preferred to speak with their physician in English. Approximately 60 percent were employed and the same percentage had no health insurance in the past six months. Almost half were homeless. Most reported recent health care use.

These barriers included inability to get to services due to transportation problems (28 percent), fear that others would find out about their health problems (11 percent), and not feeling that they need a regular physician (21 percent). On the other hand, 55 percent believed medical treatment was important. Many subjects (69 percent) had problem marijuana use, and 87 percent had problem use of more than one substance (not including nicotine). The mean score on the recognition scale (possible range 7 to 35) of the SOCRATES was 33 +/-3 (SD) and on the taking-steps scale (possible range 8 to 40) was 36 +/-4 (SD). With regard to medical and psychiatric illness, comorbidity was common. For example, 47 percent reported a chronic medical illness. The mean Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Summary (PCS) score was 48+/-11 (SD) (50 is the mean score for the U.S. general population, which has an older mean age than study subjects) (Ware 1994). Depressive symptoms were very common (CES-D mean score 33+/-12); 90 percent had a CES-D score> 16, and 80 percent had CES-D score> 21, levels that correlate with a depression diagnosis (Radloff 1977). Other markers of psychiatric disease included the findings that 26 percent had ever been prescribed a medication for a psychiatric or emotional problem, and 22 percent had ever attempted suicide. Linkage with Primary Medical Care Of the 400 subjects with follow-up, 253 (63 percent) linked with primary medical care; 56 percent (109/195) of subjects in the nonenhanced (usual) primary care referral (control) group of the randomized HELP study linked with primary care. The annualized rate of linkage for the entire cohort was 53 linkage events per 100 person-years; the corresponding rate was 44 per 100 person-years in the control group of the HELP trial. The final multivariable model considering predisposing characteristics, enabling factors, and illness is reported in Table 2 along with unadjusted estimated predicted probabilities of linkage at one year, the midpoint of follow-up. All predictor variables were assessed during the baseline interview except for having health insurance during the follow-up period. Women, those with no recent incarceration, persons with support for abstinence by family or friends, and those who had visited a medical clinic or physician in the six months prior to study enrollment were significantly (p< 0.05) associated with shorter time to linkage Table 2: The Relationship between Predisposing, Enabling, and Illness Variables and Linkage with Primary Medical Care over Two Years for Adults with Addictions (n = 392*) Older age (years) Female sex Minority race/ethnicity Married Incarceration (past five years) Family or friends support abstinence Medical visit (episodic, past six months) ++ Smoking (current) Substance problem recognition- Belief that medical treatment is important SF-36 PCS II CES-D score + Suicide attempt ever MmthsS(Unadpsted jT Other Factors) ~35 years < 35 years Female Male Minority White Married Not married Incarceration No incarceration Support Do not support One or more None Smoker Nonsmoker ~34 <34 Important Not ~ ~. ~ ~ ~ ~ 'J Table 2.

In the same model, minorities, married persons, and those recognizing their addiction linked sooner to primary medical care at a borderline level of significance (p< 0.10). In addition, although insurance at baseline was not significantly associated with linkage at follow-up (unadjusted Hazard Ratio 1.14,95 percent CI 0.88-1.46), reported insurance status during follow-up was significantly associated with linkage to primary medical care during the same time period for which the insurance was reported (adjusted Hazard Ratio 1.63 [95 percent CI 1.19-2.22], where not having insurance is the reference group). In a model in which SF-36 PCS score was replaced with the dichotomous indicator of chronic medical illness, results were similar. In a model that did not adjust for a recent episodic medical utilization, SF-36 PCS remained nonsignificant (adjusted HR 1.00, 95 percent CI 0.99-1.01). In a model that forcedin thesepreviously nonsignificant variables, alcoholism severity(adjusted HR 0.87,95 percent CI 0.57-1.33), drug addiction severity (adjusted HR 0.50, 95 percent CI 0.19-1.34), addiction treatment (adjusted HR 1.10, 95 percent CI 0.82-1.48), or mental health visit (adjusted HR0.94,95 percent CI 0.62-1.45) in the past six months remained nonsignificant, Significant and nonsignificant variables in the final model using the sequential modeling approach remained so in a single model containing all of the independent variables. There were no significant interactions between factors associated with linkage and randomized group in the HELP clinical trial except for a marginally significant interaction between randomization group and insur\u00ad ance during follow-up. In that multivariable model stratified by randomization group (e.g., enhanced referral intervention group versus nonenhanced [usual] primary care referral control group), the insurance effect was smaller among subjects in the intervention group (HR 1.30, 95 percent CI 0.85-1.98) than it was among subjects assigned to the control group (HR 2.45, 95 percent CI 1.44-4.16). DISCUSSION A substantial proportion ofthis relatively youngcohortofaddicted adultswith high health care utilization but no existing regular primary medical care 600 HSR: Health Services Research 39:3 [fune 2004) relationship failed to link with primary medical care after residential detoxification. Women, those with recent episodic medical visits, family support for abstinence, and those with insurance after detoxification, were more likely to link with primary care. Recent incarceration decreased the likelihood of linkage. Men with and without addictions are less likely to use primary medical care (Saltz, Mulvey, and Samet 1997; Lim et al. 2002; Gallagher et al. 1997). That men are less likely to link to care after detoxification suggests ...that interventions to improve linkage could target men when they are reachable in inpatient detoxification units. Many incarcerated adults report poor health status and failure to obtain needed medical care (Conklin, Lincoln, and Tuthill 2000). Since those with past incarceration were less likely to link with primary care after detoxification, efforts (already nascent in some communities [Conklin, Lincoln, and Flanigan 1998]) toward improving access to primary care should be studied. Since our data suggest that prior contacts with episodic medical care enhancethelikelihood ofenteringprimarycareafter detoxification, these care sites could make linkage efforts standard practice. This finding is consistent with prior work finding that episodic medical illness is associated with having primary medical care in adults with addictions (Saitz, Mulvey, and Samet 1997). Our finding that social support for abstinence can increase linkage suggests that patients with little support could receive social support counseling, a method already known in other settings to improve follow-up ambulatory appointment-keeping (Tanner and Feldman 1998). Health insurance during follow-upbut notat the time ofdetoxificationwas one of the strongest predictors of linking with primary medical care. This was particularly true for subjects who had not received an enhanced referral to a primary medical care clinic that served patients regardless of ability to pay. In studies of other populations including those with addictions (Saitz, Mulvey, and Samet 1997; Bierman et al. 1999), having insurance is associated with use of medicalservices.Butinthis population ofaddicted adults, manypeoplewhohad no primarymedicalcarehad healthinsurance (40percent, Table 1).Andhaving insurance at the time of contact with the detoxification unit was not enough to facilitate subsequent linkage with primary care. Only having health insurance at the right time-during the early period after detoxification when patients may begin to recognize and become concerned about medical symptoms as their sensorium clears and priorities change-was the predictor of importance. COincidentally, the period of follow-up in this study was a time when Massachusetts implemented a substantial Medicaid expansion (starting Linkage with Primary Care 607 July 1, 1997) (MassHealth 2002). And most of our subjects (90 percent) who had insurance in follow-up reported Medicaid as the insurer. Making health insurance coverage available to adults with addiction (a group disproportionately lacking primary medical care) at the right time [e.g., when they are more likely to access primary health care) is likely a generalizable strategy for improving receipt of primary care services (McCarthy et al. 2002). Differing findings regarding insurance at different times (at the time of detoxification and afterward) and during implementation of a statewide policy also demonstrate the importance of accounting for the dynamic nature ofinsurance coverage and changing policy in health services research. We had hypothesized that ethnicity, recent addiction or mental health treatment utilization, addiction severity, health status, substance problem recognition, and perceived need for medical care would affect linkage, yet they did not. The association between minority race and linkage did not reach statistical significance but was in the same direction as has been previously reported for linkage with alcohol treatment (Kirchner et al. 2000). There were no discernible effects for mental health utilization or health status in ourstudy. Healthstatuswas notassociated with havingaregularsource ofcare in another study of a similarly vulnerable homeless population (Gallagher et al. 1997). This \"need\" or illness factor, generally associated with health care utilization [Bierman etal. 1999), andassociated with havingprimarycare for people with addictions (Saitz, Mulvey, and Samet 1997), may not have risen tothe top ofa prioritylist(Gallagheretal. 1997),or perhapstheneedwas met with episodic or emergency but not primary medical care. That patient beliefs about needing a physician did not lead to getting one, is also likely explained by a reordering of priorities (such as relapse or social, legal, or psychological needs) after leaving the residential detoxification facility. For addiction treatment utilization, addiction severity, and substance problem recognition, the effects were in the hypothesized direction but they did not reach statistical significance even in this large sample. In addition, the relatively low variability in the sample may explain why an expected association was not found (e.g., all had drug dependence severe enough to warrant inpatient detoxification). The major strengths of this study were its focus on an understudied, reachable population in need, standardized prospective data collection with a high follow-up rate, and analyses based on theory. In addition, we used a broad definition of primary care based on how a physician functions in the eyes of the patient rather than based on how a health system categorizes them 602 HSR: Health Services Research 39:3 {fun\u00ab 2004) (Starfield 1998); this deliberate choice makes it very likely that subjects reporting no primary medical care truly did not have it. Limitations ofourstudyincludea 15percentlossto follow-up thatcould have biased the results, however, the minimal losses and few differences in subjectcharacteristics makethisissueless ofaconcern. Assessment ofprimary . medical care linkage by self-report may be a concern, but interview assessment ofthis outcome was a focus ofthestudy; itwas detailed, itreferred to the recent past, and it was validated against administrative data. Andrecall for an event like a visit to a new primary care physician is more accurate than recall for less notable events (Means et al. 1989).Finally, the generalizability of our results may be limited to adults with addictions in similar low\u00ad socioeconomic-status detoxification and treatment programs typically found in cities in the United States. Patients with addictions have many medical needs that go unaddressed (DeAlba, Samet, and Saitz in press; Saitz 2003). Regular primary medical care can improve their health care utilization and outcomes (Weisner et al. 2001). The challenge is to facilitate access to that care. Access could be improved by integrating primary care with addictions specialty care by having services onsite (Weisner et al. 2001), by better links between care sites (Samet, Friedmann, and Saitz 2001; Samet, Saitz, and Larson 1996), and by providing health insurance. Attention must also be paid to patient motivation and barriers to access (Teitelbaum et al. 1992). Patients with addictions who have primary care physicians have already been described in the literature, and compared with those who do not (Saitz, Mulvey, and Samet 1997). But to our knowledge, no prospective study has reported on factors associated with linkage to primary medical care after detoxification for those without a physician. Detoxification is often not followed by addiction treatment or medical care (Samet et al. 2003; Mark et al. 2002). Thus detoxification presents an opportunity to reach patients without primary care, who could benefit from such care, and who may not seek it without facilitated access. Our data from this unique population do not simply mirror findings in the general'population or even in persons with addictions (Saitz, Mulvey, and Samet 1997; Lim et al. 2002; Gallagher et al. 1997). In this setting, social support for abstinence, episodic medical care delivery contacts, incarceration, and insurance at the right time take on importance for patients with addictions who do not have, but who need primary medical care. Identification of these factors, and others significant in general and other vulnerable populations (e.g.,gender), suggest clinical and policy interventions targeted to those at greatest risk as we have outlined in this discussion. We Linkage with Primary Care 603 anticipate that this knowledge of potentially modifiable factors that affect linkage with ongoing care could be used by health systems, detoxification or addiction treatment programs, and by researchers designing interventions to improve entry into primary care at a specific common point of contact with the health care system for patients with addictions.

I m DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE JeffreyH. Samet f Drug abuse increasingly is recognized as an important mainstream health problem as a consequence of several factors: Injection drug use remains a major transmission risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; more than 1 million drug arrests occur in the United States each year; and costs are enormous, estimated as greater than $110 billion in the United States in 1995. About 15 million people older than 12 years of age have used illicit drugs at least once during the past month, and about 3.5 million people are classified as drug dependent. Medical complications of drug abuse are predominantly infectious but span organ systems and range from cocaine-related cardiac arrhythmia to neuropsychiatric effects of hallucinogens. D The terms drug (or substance) dependence and drug abuse have specificclinical meanings (Table30-1). Dependence is the more severe disorder and frequently is associated with physiologic and psycho\u00ad logical manifestations. Tolerance and withdrawal are the major phys\u00ad iologic manifestations of drug dependence. Tolerance is defined as either a need for increased amounts of the substance to achieve the desired effect or a diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of the substance. Withdrawal is manifested by a characteris\u00ad ticsyndrome with suddenabstinence, butit mayberelieved or avoided if the same or a closely related substance is taken. The other criteria for dependence relate to the pattern of drug use (i.e., taken in a larger amount or longer period than intended); effects on life activi\u00ad ties (i.e., great deal of time spent on activities to obtain, use, or recover from the substance; reduction in social, occupational, or recreational activities as a result of substance use); and the psychological need to use the substance (i.e., use despite awareness of adverse conse\u00ad quences, persistent desire for the substance, or inability to control its use). A diagnosis of substance abuse requires the recurrent use of a substance over 12 months with subsequent adverse consequences (e.g., failure to fulfill a major role at work, school, or home; legal problems; persistent interpersonal problems) orplacement ofan indi\u00ad vidual in high-risk, physically hazardous situations. Addiction is a chronic, relapsing illness characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use. The degree of harm associated with occasional drug use or \"exper\u00ad imentation n isdifficult to quantify, and no definition has been assigned formally to the use of illicit drugs with consequences less than those associated with the abuse definition. Fear of progression to abuse or dependence, the potential morbidity of use of drugs such as cocaine, the criminality associated with drug use, and the high-risk behavior while under the influence of a drug are the basis of recommendations to proscribe use of these substances. Chapter 30 Drug Abuse and Dependence EtiolOgy A minority of people who ever experiment with an illicit drug progress to a clinical drug abuse diagnosis. The cofactors responsi\u00ad ble for progression to dependence and abuseare only panially defined. Genetic susceptibility, social context of the drug use, and comorbid psychiatric conditions are considered important factors affecting an individual's potential for subsequent problems. Twin studies suggest that genetics plays a role in a person's positive or negative perception of a drug's effect. The social context in which drug abuse develops and is expressed is important. Returning Vietnam War veterans addicted to heroin were relatively easy to treat compared with addicts on the streets of the United States, in part because the veterans had become addicted in a setting different from the one they found on return home and were exposed to few enduring environmental cues. Psychiatric comorbidity, particularly depression and panic disorders, seems to be a high-risk condition for the development of drug abuse and possible consequences of this abuse. DRUG Of ABUSE:... _1lIB ..... CIISSiIICaIIII Opioids, Papaver somniferum), semisynthetic compounds altered alkaloids), and synthetic agents, are potent anal\u00ad gesics and producean intense euphoria associated with nausea; drowsi\u00ad ness; miosis; and a decrease in respiration, pulse, and blood pressure. Opioids also are valued for their calming, antitussive, and antidiar\u00ad rheal properties. Depending on the particular effect on opioid cell membrane receptors, they may be classified as agonists (morphine, heroin, methadone), partial agorusts-antagomsts (buprenorphine), or antagonists (naloxone, naltrexone). These drugs have led to many medical complications because of their abuse potential and their parenteral route of administration. In the 19th century, opioids were used commonly in many set\u00ad tings in the United States. The drug was supplied freely by physicians to treat symptoms of pain, anxiety, cough, and diarrhea. Opiates also were available without restriction in commercial medicinal remedies. In 1806, a pure substance was isolated from opium and named morphine after the Greek god of dreams Morpheus. Bythe middle of the 19th century, the advent of the hypodermic needle allowed this inexpensive, standard-strength agent tobecomeahighlyeffective pain\u00ad killing and calming therapy. Smoking opium, which has no medici\u00ad nal value, also rose in the latter half of the 19th century. In 1898, heroin was introduced commercially by the Bayer Company as an antitussive and was used as therapy for morphine addiction. The increasing recognition of the perils of opiate addiction, its identifi\u00ad cation with foreign groups and internal minorities, and concern over the estimated prevalence of 250,000 opiate users in 1900 led to a series of state and federal measures culminating in the Harrison Narcotic Act in 1914, which legislated controls over the importation and distribution of opiates. Opiate use remained a problem in the early 20th century despite interdiction efforts and the development and dismantling of narcotic clinics that maintained narcotic addicts with prescription drugs. In the 1920s, narcotic abuse became a predominantly underground activity. Efforts to treat narcotic addiction as a medical problem were limited until the advent of methadone maintenance therapy in the 196Os. In the United States, an estimated 3 million people have reponed prior use of heroin. About 170,000 of the estimated 810,000 opioid\u00ad dependent persons are enrolled in opioid treatment programs. An estimated 150,000 individuals become new heroin users each year, an upward trend comparable with increases seen in the epidemic associated with the Vietnam War in the late 1960s. New users are likelytobeyoung(72%<26years old),noninjecting (63%), andurban dwellers (89%). Polysubstance narcotic addictsmeeting the criteria foralcohol isthemost common substance used together with opiates. Opioids exert their effects on specific receptors for three distinct familiesof endogenous opioid peptides: enkephalins, endorphins, and dynorphins. In the central nervous system, three major classes of opioid receptors with unique selectivity and pharmacologic pro\u00ad fileshave been identified: u, K, and major classes (Ill, 1l2, xl , K2, K3, 01, 02) have been elucidated primarily by the use of selective receptor antagonists. Il receptor activity is associated with the most prominent manifestations of morphine and heroin: respiratory depression, analgesia, euphoria, and the devel\u00ad opment of dependence. It is thought that opioid peptides acting as neurotransmitters or neurornodulators exert their actions at neuronal synapses. Heroin may be injected intravenously or subcutaneously, snorted, smoked, or ingested. The parenteral and inhaled routes of adminis\u00ad tration result in the most rapid delivery of drug to the brain and are the most potentially addicting. As the purity of street heroin has increased from less than 5% in the 1960s to 80% in the 1990s, its nonparenteral administration has risen. Heroin may be used intermittently or regularly. Intermittent users generally either quit or become regular users within 1 to 3 years. Given the drug's short half-life, regular users require two to four daily doses to avoid with\u00ad drawal symptoms. Heroin's initial effect is an intense euphoria described as a \"rush\" or \"kick,\" compared in intensity and pleasure with an orgasm, that lasts 45 seconds to several minutes. The initial effects may be per\u00ad ceivedasa turningin thestomachwith tingling and warmth.Auser's first experience may be unpleasant because of nausea, vomiting, and anxiety,but these effects decrease or become less of a concern to the user over time. The intense euphoria is followed by an intoxicated pleasant feeling referred to as \"nodding,\" with decreased respiration and peristalsis. The depressant effect of heroin on the central nervous system is marked, particularly after parenteral administration. Sedation, mental clouding, decreased visual acuity, heavy feeling in the extremities, light sleep with vivid dreams, and reduction in anxiety are typical, at least until tolerance develops. Physical signs include CbapI8r 30 Drug Abuse and Dependence 147 Table \u00bb-2 SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF WITHDRAWAL FROM OPIOIDS AND COCAINE \u00ad OPIOIO WITHDRAWAl Vital signs Tachycardia, hypertension, fever Centralnervoussystem Ct:aving,restlessness, insomnia, muscle cramps, C~h . Withdrawal Extinction miosis, decreased heart rate, and lowered blood pressure. In addition to these effects on opioid receptors, heroin causes the release of histamine, which may result in itching, scleral injection, and hypotension. High levels of tolerance develop rapidly with regard to respiratory depression, analgesia, sedation, vomiting, and euphoric properties. Little tolerance develops for miosis or constipation, so a heroin addict with an acutely painful medical condition may complain of insuffi\u00ad cient analgesia despite pinpoint pupils. Cross-tolerance is common among opioids. Fromthepatient'sperspective, withdrawal fromheroin isadreaded clinical condition, a mix of emotional, behavioral, and physical signs and symptoms (Table 3~2). Although unpleasant, it is not life-threat\u00ad ening. The timing of withdrawal symptoms, which are related directly to clearance of the drug, begins 4 to 8 hours after the last dose of heroin. The acute withdrawal syndrome peaks in intensity after 36 to 72 hours and resolves over 5 to 7 days. In addition to the acute abstinence syndrome, a protracted absti\u00ad nence syndrome occurs and lasts 6 months or more. In contrast to the hyperadrenergic characteristics of the primary withdrawal syn\u00ad drome (tachycardia, hypertension, elevated temperature, mydriasis, and diaphoresis), the period afterward can consist of sluggishness, sleep disturbance, and malaise. Craving can recur for years after ces\u00ad sation of drug use. An understanding of the nature of recovery from heroin use is important for setting appropriate expectations for the patient and the health care provider. Continued 148 CIIa_ 30 Drug Abuse and Dependence diffuse glomerulosclerosis (Chapter 119). In HIV-infected patients, HIV-associated nephropathy also is found (Chapter 420). Of patients in methadone maintenance clinics, 50 to 90% have positive serologic studies for hepatitis Band C. Complications of these. infections (Chapter 152) range from chronic asymptomatic antigenernia to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Neurologic complications ofopioid abuseareinfectious and non\u00ad infectious. Seizures, most often generalized, are the most common noninfectious complication. The cause of seizures includes over\u00ad dose, with centrally mediated respiratory depression and hypoxia, (epidural, subdural, and brain) are injection drug use.

Right-sided endocarditis is a common complication. (From Forbes CD, Jackson WF: Color Atlas and Text of Clinical Medicine, 3rd ed.

These analgesic medications vary in their potency and bioavailabil\u00ad oxycodone, OxyContin, has gained great popularity among recreational and dependent opioid users since its approval in 1995. By crushing these pills and destroying the slow-release matrix in which the opioid is embedded, oxycodone is abused orally, parenterally, and intranasally, yielding effects comparable to heroin. An estimated 2.6 million Americans misuse pain relievers each year. Despite these abuses, it is important for the physician to understand that it is uncommon for appropriate use of these medications in the treatment of pain to lead to opioid dependence (Chapter 29). DRUG ABUSE: ..... OTIB PSYCIIOSTMIANTS ClassifiCaIIOn Cocaine, an alkaloid extracted leaves, and other psy\u00ad chostimulants (e.g., amphetamine, methamphetamine) rapidly increase the concentration of several neurotransmitters in synaptic junctions and stimulate the sympathetic and central nervous systems. Topical cocaine is used in otolaryngologic procedures, and psycho\u00ad stimulants are used either for their stimulant effects or for their paradoxical calming effect in some patients with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. HIstOry The earliest recorded use of cocaine in the form of ingested coca leafoccurred around 3000 Be. In 1860, cocaine was isolated and incor\u00ad porated into tonics, teas, and wines. In the 1880s, an Atlanta drug\u00ad gist patented a product that contained two naturally occurring stimulants, cocaine and caffeine, which eventually became known as Coca-Cola; until 1903, it contained approximately 60mg of cocaine per 8-oz serving. In the late 19th century, reports of cocaine addic\u00ad tion surfaced, and its use was restricted after passage of the Harrison Narcotic Act of 1914. The abuse potential of amphetamines led to their being listed as schedule II drugs, which are defined as having a high potential for abuse with severe liability to cause psychic or physical dependence. Anestimated 1.5millionAmericans, representing 0.8%ofthepop\u00ad ulation aged 12 years and older, have used cocaine in the past month. More than 900,000 Americans use cocaine for the first time each year, and more than 30 million Americans have used cocaine at least once. Use is higher in the 18- to 34-year-old age group (l.5 to 2.0%), in men than in women (1.1 versus 0.5%), in urban areas, and among individualswithlesseducation. Although currentcocaineuseishighest in the unemployed (2.4%), 73% of adult users are employed full-time or part-time. Current cocaine use is similar for whites (0.8%), blacks (1.0%), and Hispanics (1.1 %). Cocaine increases neurotransmitter concentrations at the synaptic terminal by blocking the reuptake of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin and by potentiating the release of these monoamines. In the heart, a-adrenergic and ~-adrenergic receptors are stimulated. I 150 CIupIer 30 Drug Abuse and Dependence past year, and more than 75million have used marijuana in their lifetime. Cannabinoids bind to specific receptors for the endogenous ligand anandamide: CBl in the brain and CB2 in the periphery. G-protein activation occurs as a result of the receptor binding and has three effects: inhibition of adenylate cyclase, increased potassium ion con\u00ad ductance, and decreased calcium ion conductance. CBl receptors the cortex, cerebel1um, and striatum. Smoked marijuana results in a variety of acute changes within 3 minutes that peak within 20 to 30 minutes; when ingested, onset takes 30 to 60 minutes, and the peak effect occurs after 2 to 3 hours. An average cigarette contains 2.5 to 5 mg of THC, and 50 to 60% of it is absorbed. THC is lipophilic and distributed rapidly throughout the body.Becauseofslowreleasefromadipose tissue,THCor itsmetabo\u00ad lites can be found in urine 1 to 3 days after use in nonchronic users and 30 days after use in chronic users (see Table 30-3). Most effects last 2 to 3 hours after inhalation; psychomotor effects can last 11 hours. Effects include conjunctival injection, mild euphoria, impaired memory, dry mouth, motor incoordination, time\u00ad space distortion, increased visual and auditory awareness, increased hunger, sleepiness, and spontaneous laughter; some may experience nausea, headaches, tremors, decreased muscle strength, and increased anxiety. Few chronic effects have been attributed to marijuana use, but an amotivational syndrome has been described in which young people lose goal-directed behavior with regard to school or work. \"IIIIUSE: LU..01JB IIIlUaIJGEIIS Hallucinogen use results predominantly in changes in thought, perception, and mood. Minimal impairment occurs in memory or intellect. This class of drugs is not general1yassociated with stupor, narcosis, or excessive stimulation. Users do not.exhibit craving. The two major categories of hallucinogens are amyl or butyl nitrite. These drugs have no appropriate clinical role. In the United States, the lifetime prevalence of hallucinogen use isabout 11 %;morethan 25millionindividualshaveusedhallucinogens at least once. LSDwas used widely on college campuses in the 1960s. The 1970s and early 19805 saw a decline in the use of most hallu\u00ad cinogens. Hallucinogen use increased in the 1990s, however, and by 1998 there were 1.2 million new users, twice the average in the 1980s. The classic hallucinogens are structural1y similar to many major neurotransmitters, but serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HTj) agonist or partial agonist properties have been associated most con\u00ad sistently with its actions. These drugs bind at 5-HT 2A and 5-HT 2c receptors with high affinity. These receptors are found in greatest density in brain cortical nuclei, and inferior olive) and may have a role in depression and suicide. Hallucinogen use results in an altered perception of one's envi\u00ad ronment marked by a subjective feeling of enhanced mental activity, perceptual distortions, visual hal1ucinations, sharpened sense of hearing, and a reduced ability to tel1 the difference between one's self and one's surroundings. These drugs can produce sympathomimetic effects, including mydriasis, flushed face, fine tremor, piloerection, high blood pressure, hyperthermia, and hyperglycemia. Panic attacks and psychosis are the two major adverse effects.Clinical1y\"desired\" effects and adverse effects vary by specific hallucinogen. Altered per\u00ad ceptions can be associated with paranoid delusions, manic or depressed behavior, and confusion. Aggressive behavior has been described with psychosis; in particular, PCP has been implicated in violent crimes. The psychotic episodes can last hours or days, and flashbacks can occur. Precipitants for flashbacks are anxiety, stress, fatigue, emergence into a dark environment, and marijuana. Although tolerance can develop with hal1ucinogens, the clinical syndrome is unusual inasmuch as chronic use is uncommon. No clin\u00ad ically significant withdrawal symptoms are known. Concerns about chronic use include prolonged psychotic episodes, decreased intellect, organic brain syndrome, and possibly \"chromosomal damage,\" although definitive correlations have not been established. r The use ofhal1ucinogens may be detected in the acute setting when examining a patient with toxic manifestations or may be noted when f obtaining a history of drug use. After diagnosis, it is important to obtain a history of other substance abuse and psychiatric illness and a neurologic evaluation. No specific laboratory tests are required; a urine toxicologic screen for other drugs of abuse is recommended (see Table 30-3). LSDoften is sold as postage stamp-size papers impregnated with varying doses of LSD, from 50llg to more than 3001lg. Doses of 20llg can lead to psychological effects, with doses of 100llg causing hallucinogenic psychoactive manifestations within 1 to 2 hours. Clearing of symptoms begins in 10 to 12hours, although symptoms of fatigue and tension can persist for an additional 24 hours. PCp, also known as \"phencyclidine\" or \"angel dust,\" originally wasdevelopedasananestheticin the 1950sbut was abandoned because of frequent postoperative delirium and hallucinations. It can be obtained in various forms (powder, liquid, tablet, capsule, or sprayed on other drugs such as marijuana) and administered by several rou tl~S (smoked, ingested, snorted, or injected intravenously). The drug is water soluble and lipophilic, so it penetrates fat stores and has a long half-life, up to 3 days. Casual use by smoking on a weekly basis is most common, although some have reported continuous intake lasting 2 days or longer. A pronounced pharmacologic characteristic of PCP is its analgesia and amphetamine-like addition speech, nystag!TIus, and numbness com\u00ad monly are observed at doses of 1 to lOmg. Emotional withdrawal, catatonic posturing resembling schizophrenia, and physical violence can result from use. \"II\"': BENZmIIZEPIB..lIB SBIATIVES Benzodiazepinesand thelesscommonlyused barbiturates arelegit\u00ad potential. These drugs are desig\u00ad nated as schedule IV substances by the Drug Enforcement Agency and the Food and Drug Administration. Schedule IV drugs have a low potential for abuse and lead to limited physical or psychological dependence. Nonmedical use of tranquilizers and sedatives occurs in fewer than 2% of u.s. adults annual1y. The magnitude of the problem is substantially less than that of opioids, psychostimulants, and marijuana. This problem occurs largely in individuals who also abuse other substances. This finding is consistent with the experience in laboratory animals, which do not exhibit repeated self-administra\u00ad tion, a standard measure of addictive potential, when exposed to benzodiazepines. Allbenzodiazepines studied are capable of producing physiologic dependence even when used in low doses over prolonged periods as may be seen in clinical practice. The key to the diagnosis of benzo\u00ad diazepine or other sedative abuse is evidence of inappropriate drug\u00ad taking behavior, including escalation in dose, obtaining prescriptions from multiple physicians, or taking the drug for reasons other than those for which it was prescribed. Physiologic dependence should not imply that inappropriate drug-taking behavior exists. Beforeini\u00ad tiating clinical use of benzodiazepines and other sedatives, a careful medical history must be obtained regarding current and prior sub\u00ad stance abuse. Although not absolutely contraindicated, particular caution and extra monitoring are appropriate in patients with such a history. IIW IIIUGS II ABUSE: CUllIIRUGS Newer (MDMA), y-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), and ketamine, are used in a variety of settings. When ingested in association with inadequate fluid intake, vigorous exercise, or a hot, humid environment, these drugs are particularly likely to cause complicanons. MDMA (ECSTASY) MDMA,commonly referred toas \"Ecstasy,\" isasynthetic analogue of amphetamine and shares properties with amphetamine and hallu\u00ad cinogenic drugs. Itacts on the serotonin transporter, stimulating sero\u00ad tonin release and inhibiting its reuptake. Although usually taken in the pin form, MDMAalso can be snorted, injected, or administered er rectum. The purity ofMDMA tablets may vary 70-fold, and tablets ~ay include caffeine, heroin, or mescaline. More than 8% of high school seniors report using MDMA. . MDMA's clinical effects are predominately sensory enhancement with distortion and decreased inhibitions. The onset of action is 30 to 60 minutes, the peak effects occur at 90 minutes, and the duration is 8 hours or more. Common adverse effects, which are similar to effects found with amphetamines and cocaine, include sweating, muscle spasms, involuntary teeth clenching, faintness, chills, and tachycardia. Psychological manifestations include confusion, depres\u00ad sion,sleepproblems, severeanxiety, andparanoia. High temperatures and muscle exertion from dancing seem to lower the threshold for serious MDMA-associated adverse effects, a metabolite of the neurotransmitter y-aminobutyric acid. It is thought to function as a neurotransmitter, producing a dopaminergic response and release of an opiate-like substance. Its half-life is approximately 30 minutes. GHB is used for its euphoric and anabolic effects. Behavioral changes include increased aggression, and neurologic changes range from mild ataxia to apnea. Withdrawal symptoms are similar to those of sedative abuse and persist for 3 to 7 days. There is no antidote for GHB overdoses, and treatment is limited to nonspecific supportive care. KETAMINE Ketamine, commonly referred to as \"Special K,\" is anal\u00ad gesic, and amnesic effects. Most of ketamine's activity is associated with N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Because it causes an intense dissociative state and loss of physical control, ketamine use is asso\u00ad ciated with a high risk of injuries. Ketamine usually is acquired from veterinary clinics. Patients who use illicit drugs benefit from treatment if they rec\u00ad ognize that their substance use is a problem. The transtheoretical model considers a patient on a continuum from precontemplation (denial) toward maintenance (abstinence/recovery) (Fig. 30-2). The clinical approach should be tailored to the patient's readiness to change behavior and enter treatment. For all abused drugs, medical fol1ow-up after any acute toxic presentation is essential to address substance abuse issues and possible coexisting medical and psychiatric problems. The major goals of drug abuse treatment are detoxification, absti\u00ad nence initiation, and relapse prevention. Treatment can be pharma\u00ad cologicand nonpharmacologic. Pharmacologic approaches are offered by physicians specializing in addiction and increasingly by primary care physicians.

Much of this work is done by sub\u00ad stance abuse care providers. Physicians are in an excel1ent position to detect drug abuse, however, by exploring this history when confronted by a possible drug abuse-related clinical manifestation. Primary care physicians also can make significant contributions. Individuals with substance abuse-related medical conditions were more likely to remain abstinent when randomized to an integrated medical care and substance abuse treatment program . Theactive ingredients ofbriefintervention havebeen summarized by the acronym FRAMES: (I) feedback of personal risk or impairment (e.g.,sharingabnormal testresults,discussingmedical complications), (2) emphasis on personal responsibility to change, (3) clear adviceto change, (4) a menuofdifferent optionsforchange,(5) provider empathy, and (6) enhancement of patient self-efficacy or optimism. Physicians can refer to substance abuse treatment specialists; self-help groups (e.g., Narcotics Anonymous) are often part of a successful abstinence maintenance program. Pharmacologic treatment of opioid abuse includes agonist, opioid withdrawal substitution (e.g., methadone) or symptomatic treatment (e.g., clonidine). A new treatment involves the use of buprenorphine, which has agonist and antagonist properties. It has a better safety profile and produces less physical dependence. Hospitalized opioid-dependent patients may be treated with methadone for withdrawal symptoms by any physician. Methadone for the postdischarge treatment of opioid addiction is cur\u00ad rently available only via special1ylicensed treatment facilities. Prevention of relapse to active heroin abuse has been attempted most commonly by substitution of a safer drug (e.g., methadone, buprenorphine, or the second-line agent, I-acetyl-u-methadol) with similar pharmacologic properties to relieve the craving and withdrawal and to block some of the euphoric effects of heroin (Table 30-4). These medications IS mg] substantial1y reduced use of illicit opioids compared with low-dose methadone (20 mg) inRelation toInflammatory Disease In an already detoxified patient, a less common alternative is to use an opioid antagonist (e.g., naltrexone) that effectively blocks agonist stimulation. Methadone is not adequate treatment for acute pain syndromes. Although an emphasis on the treatment and prevention of drug abuse is crucial, physicians also can promote measures to reduce harm for injection drug users, including participation in needle exchange programs, avoidance of \"shooting galleries\" to obtain or administer drugs, prescriptions for needles and syringes, and instruc\u00ad tions never to share \"works\" (injection equipment). These interven\u00ad tions, which can be delivered by physicians to drug abusers, have played a crucial role in international efforts to limit the spread of HIV infection. Cocaine abuse is treated by psychotherapy, behavioral therapy, and 12-step programs. Acupuncture has been used for detoxification and for preventing relapse. As yet, no pharmacologic agent has been con\u00ad sistently effective in reducing cocaine use or craving. Dopamine ago\u00ad nists, antidepressants, and other drugs have been studied, but none are currently recommended. No antidote is known for acute cocaine overdose. Marijuana use rarely requires acute treatment in the medical setting. Reassurance generally is sufficient to manage the occasional dysphoric manifestations. Occasionally,anxiety reactions require specific therapy with benzodiazepines; rarely, psychotic reactions are treated with haloperidol. Specific therapy for the complications of hallUcinogen use is non\u00ad pharmacologic and involves emotional reassurance and a calm sup\u00ad portive environment. No specific antagonists are clinically available for any of the hallucinogens, Medications are required only if the patient cannot be controlled adequately, in which case anxiolytic drugs are recommended. Discontinuation of benzodiazepines can be accomplished in dependent patients by prescribing a regimen of gradual dose reduc\u00ad tion. Alternatively, another long-acting sedative-hypnotic can be sub\u00ad stituted for the drug of abuse and gradually withdrawn. It is important to attempt to verify that the patient has no alternative sources for these medications. With current understanding of the associated morbidities and costs of drug use, increasing emphasis will be placed on the contributions that physicians can make in the care of patients with drug abuse and dependence. Opportunities to work with substance abuse providers to treat opioid-dependent patients in the primary medical care setting with pharmacologic therapy, including buprenorphine and methadone, will become widely available. Such future opportunities will increase the need for physicians to obtain skills to screen for drug abuse, address use of illicit drugs, and intervene to reduce the harm of these addic\u00ad tive behaviors. 1.

ED IN RElI1ION TO INRAMMATORY D&ISE Paul Katz For more than 50 years, glucocorticosteroids have been important agents in treating diseases characterized by inflammation and exag\u00ad gerated immune responses. The pioneering work of Hench and col\u00ad leagues in rheumatoid arthritis showed the possible potency of these agents in such pathologic states. Although substantial advances have been made in understanding the mechanisms by which glucocorti\u00ad costeroids exert beneficial effects, considerable gaps in knowledge remain. Despite extensive data regarding the in vitro and in vivo activ\u00ad ities of these drugs, it is probable that glucocorticosteroids have dif\u00ad ferent beneficial activities in different diseases. The challenge of glucocorticosteroid therapy continues to be the counterbalancing of desirable anti-inflammatory and immunosup\u00ad pressive actions versus undesirable pharmacologic activities. More precise understanding of the mechanisms of action of glucocortico\u00ad steroids has not resulted in the development of regimens with minimal toxicity. The glucocorticosteroid preparations available for systemic use (Table 31-1) differ in their relative anti-inflammatory potency, poten\u00ad tial for sodium retention, and plasma and biologic half-lives. In general, shorter acting preparations, such as prednisone and prednisolone, are preferable to longer acting agents, such as dexamethasone, because tapering to an alternate-day schedule cannot be accomplished with drugs with prolonged (i.e., >24 hours) biologic half-lives. Additionally, hydrocortisone and cortisone rarely are used to treat inflammatory and immunologically mediated diseases because of the considerable mineralocorticoid activity that accompanies their use.

Samet, Nicholas J. Horton, Seville Meli, Kenneth A. Freedberg, and Anita Palepu Background: Alcohol abuse has been associated with poor adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). We examined the relative importance of varying levels of alcohol consumption on adherence in HIV-infected patients with a history of alcohol problems. Methods: We surveyed 349 HIV-infected persons with a history of alcohol problems at 6-month inter\u00ad vals. Of these subjects, 267 were taking HAART at one or more time periods during the 3D-month follow-up period. Interviews assessed recent adherence to HAART and past month alcohol consumption, defined as \"none\", \"moderate\", and \"at risk\". We investigated the relationship between adherence to HAART and alcohol consumption at baseline and at each subsequent 6-month follow-up interval using multivariable longitudinal regression models, while controlling for potential confounders. Results: Among the 267 HI V-infected persons with a history of alcohol problems who were receiving HAART, alcohol consumption was the most significant predictor of adherence (p < 0.0001), with better adherence being associated with recent abstinence from alcohol, compared with at-risk level usage (odds ratio = 3.6,95% confidence interval = 2.1-6.2) or compared with moderate usage (odds ratio = 3.0, 95% confidence interval = 2.0-4.5). Conclusions: Any alcohol use among HIV-infected persons with a history of alcohol problems is asso\u00ad ciated with worse HAART adherence. Addressing alcohol use in Hl'V-infected persons may improve antiretroviral adherence and ultimately clinical outcomes. Key Words: HIV, Adherence, Alcohol, Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy. HIGHLY ACTIVE ANTIRETROVIRAL therapy (HAART) has led to substantial reductions in mor\u00ad bidity and mortality as well as improved quality of life for many Hlv-infected individuals (Hogg et aI., 1999; Palella et al., 1998; Revicki et aI., 1999). Paterson et a1. (2000) found that adherence to protease inhibitor therapy of 95% or greater is required for optimal HIV-RNA suppression.

Reasons suggested by patients for not being fully adherent with HAART include forget\u00ad fulness, being away from home or too busy, or having a change in their daily routine (Bartlett, 2002). Other barri\u00ad ers to optimal adherence include psychiatric disorders such as depression or substance use (Arnsten et aI., 2002; Lucas et aI.,2001,2002; Paterson et aI.,2000;Starace et al.,2002), regimen complexity (Stone et aI., 2001), and medication side effects (Ammassari et aI., 2001). Alcohol consumption is common among HIV-infected persons and has an important relationship to HAART adherence. The prevalence of heavy drinking in the Na\u00ad tional HIV Cost and Services Utilization Study among the 2864 HIV-infected patients in the United States in care was 8%. Factors significantly associated with heavy drinking were cocaine and heroin use, less education \u00abhigh school vs college), and not having a history of an AIDS-defining illness (Galvan et aI., 2002). Cook et a1. (2001) found that 19% of HIV-infected primary care patients reported prob\u00ad lem drinking. Additionally, 33% consumed mild to moder\u00ad ate amounts of alcohol. Compared with nonproblem drink\u00ad ers, problem drinkers were more likely to take their antiretroviral medications off schedule (Cook et aI., 2001). Paterson et a1. (2000) found a nonsignificant trend of fewer patients with alcohol problems among those with 95% or greater adherence compared with less than 95% adherence Alcohol Clin Exp Res, Vol 28, No ADHERENCE, HAART, AND ALCOHOL (4% vs, 17%, p = 0.13). The relationship between alcohol and antiretroviral therapy adherence is important to inves\u00ad tigate because alcohol consumption is a potentially modi\u00ad fiable characteristic associated with nonadherence (Cook et aI., 2001). In this study we further investigate the relationship be\u00ad tween alcohol consumption and adherence to HAART. Our objective was to determine whether there is a safe level of alcohol consumption with regard to HAART adherence for HIV-infected patients with a history of alcohol prob\u00ad lems. We examined these issues among participants in the HIV-Alcohol Longitudinal Cohort (HIV-ALC) study. METHODS Study Design We analyzed data from a prospective cohort of HIV-infected patients with a history of alcohol problems. Subjects were observed from one to seven times over 36 months. One hundred and fifty-one subjects in the cohort participated in a randomized controlled trial of a HAART adher\u00ad ence intervention (ADHERE study; Samet et aI., 2(02); appropriate adjustments were made to the analysis to account for the trial. Study Population Patients who were HIV infected and had a history of alcohol problems were identified by explicit eligibility criteria. All potential subjects who gave two or more positive responses to the CAGE questionnaire (Ewing, 1984), a screening test for lifetime alcohol problems, were eligible. In addition, those patients recruited from the Boston Medical Center HIV Diagnostic Evaluation Unit (Samet et aI., 1995) who did not meet CAGE criteria were eligible if one of two attending physicians (JS and KF) made a specific diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence. Other entry criteria included the following: fluency in English or Spanish, Mini-Mental State Examination score greater than 20 (Folstein et aI., 1975), and no plans to move from the Boston area in the next 2 years. The Institutional Review Boards of both Boston Medical Center and Beth Israel Deaconess Med\u00ad ical Center approved the study. From July 1997 through July 2001, recruitment of subjects occurred by multiple methods and from several sites: Boston Medical Center HIV Diagnostic Evaluation Unit 56%; posted flyers in the community 17%; Boston Medical Center Primary Care Clinic 13%; respite facility for homeless persons 5%; methadone clinic 4%; subject referrals 4%; and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 2%. The eligibility criterion of a history of alcohol problems was determined by the CAGE questionnaire in 313 of 349 (90%) subjects and based on clinical assessment in 36 of 349 (10%) subjects. Diagnostic interviews for alcohol problems in a sample of these subjects (n = 141) revealed that 95% had a lifetime history of either alcohol dependence (80% [113of 141])or abuse (15% [21of 141];(Samet et aI., 2004). Follow-up continued through July 2001. Data Collection After obtaining informed consent, a research associate interviewed subjects using a standardized instrument to ascertain baseline information including demographics, drug and alcohol consumption, use of substance abuse treatment services, use of HAART, and adherence to HAART in the preceding 6 months. We attempted to obtain CD4 cell counts and HIV RNA level on all subjects. Laboratory tests performed within 6 months of the interview as part of clinical care were recorded. If not available through routine clinical care, blood samples were obtained and tested for CD4 cell count and HIV RNA using the Boston Medical Center Clinical Laboratory. For the Spanish interview instrument, standardized scales in Spanish were used when available; the remainder of the questionnaire was translated from English into Spanish, back-translated to check for accu\u00ad racy, and then corrected. Outcome Variable The outcome variable of interest was self-reported adherence to HAART. Using the AIDS Clinical Trials Group instrument, patients reported the names of their antiretroviral medications as well as the number of doses and the total number of pills prescribed daily (Chesney et al.,2(00). The 3-day self-reported number ofpillsmissedwascomputed for each HIV medication. We defined adherence as a dichotomous vari\u00ad able, in which patients less than 100% adherent over the prior 3 days were considered nonadherent. Primary Independent Variable Alcohol consumption wasassessed by patientinterview usingaseriesof standardized questions on alcohol use. The battery included alcohol quan\u00ad tity and frequency questions and the Addiction Severity Index, an assess\u00ad ment instrument with well-documented reliability and validity, even among homeless persons (McLellan et aI., 1985). To encourage truth telling about alcohol consumption, breath alcohol level was also measured before the interview (Gibb et aI., 1984). We used the NIAAA guideline for at-risk drinking: greater than 14 drinks per week (or more than 4 drinks per day) for men, and greater than 7 drinks per week (or more than 3 drinks per day) for women (NIAAAAlcoholism, 1995). Alcohol consump\u00ad tion below these levels was considered moderate use in this study. Other Variables Other specific variables assessed included gender, age, race/ethnicity, perceived social support from friends (Procidano and Heller, 1983), homelessness (which was defined as having spent at least one night either on the street or in a shelter in the 6 months before the interview), depressive symptoms using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depres\u00ad sion scale (CES-D; Andresen et aI., 1994), and any history of AIDS\u00ad defining opportunistic infections, any heroin and cocaine use over the prior 30 days, CD4 cell counts, Log HIV RNA levels, number of medica\u00ad tion doses per day, and involvement in the ADHERE study. Perceived social support was collected at the initial observation and all scheduled follow-up interviews except the second. Analysis Bivariate comparisons of drinking and adherence at initial assessment were conducted using analysis of variance for continuous variables and >I\u00ad test for categorical variables. Variables considered as covariates and in\u00ad cluded in the multivariable longitudinal logistic regression model were either previously demonstrated to be associated with adherence in the literature or perceived as clinicallysignificant. Multivariable logistic longitudinal regression analysis using generalized estimating equations (Liang and Zeger, 1986) was used to relate level of alcohol consumption (none, moderate, or at risk) to adherence to HAART over time. Because serial measures on the same individuals were considered for the medication adherence analyses, generalized estimating equations were used to adjust for correlation between these measures over time using an exchangeable working correlation matrix (Liang and Zeger, 1986; Zeger and Liang, 1986). Depending on the number of completed visits,each subject contributed from one to seven interviews. A main effect term of time was included in the model for each time point (6 degrees of freedom). We adjusted for the following predictors in our model: gender, race/ethnicity, age, social support, homelessness, use of cocaine, use of heroin, number of antiretroviral medication doses per day, depressive symptom score, and involvement in the ADHERE randomized controlled trial (intervention, control, and not enrolled). All of the predictor vari\u00ad ables except for gender and age were allowed to vary with time. Because social support from friends was not collected at the second scheduled observation, the value from the initial observation was used at the first and 574 SAMET ET AL. second time points. For the social support 14-item scale, we used all scale scores that had eight or more completed items. All analyses were carried out using SAS/STAT version 8.2 (SAS/ST AT, 2001). RESULTS There were 267 subjects in this study who were taking HAART, of whom 215 (81%) were male; mean age was 41 years; two thirds were ethnic minorities. Subjects were interviewed a median of three times (range, one to seven visits over a maximum of 36 months). The number of subjects completing one to seven interviews is as follows: (1) 56; (2) 32; (3) 41; (4) 43; (5) 34; (6) 42; and (7) 19. Because some subjects were observed but did not respond to all questions, a total of 798 observations were included in the multivariable regression models. In a different analysis of data from the entire HIV-ALC cohort, Ehrenstein et al. (2004) found that time of recruitment into the study was the most important predictor of the number of completed interviews (p < 0.0001). Other characteristics of the cohort at the initial observa\u00ad tion are presented in Table 1. The mean CES-D score for depressive symptoms, 22, was above the threshold com\u00ad monly used to indicate depressive symptoms (>16). One fourth (n = 67) reported being homeless in the prior 6 months. Heroin and cocaine use in the previous 30 days was reported by 10% and 25%, respectively. Within the 6 months before the initial observation, 60% of the cohort received substance abuse treatment services, 61% attended at least one self-help meeting per week, and 27% spent at le~st one night in jail. Sixty-six percent were fully adherent USIng 3-day self-report at the initial observation; mean number of doses of antiretroviral therapy per day was five.

HAART at the initial observation, stratified by alcohol consumption, are shown in Table 2. The distribution of alcohol consumption was none (60%), moderate drinking (24%), and at-risk drinking (16%). Unadjusted compari\u00ad sons at the initial observation indicate no significant differ\u00ad e~ces in race/ethnicity, age, gender, social support, depres\u00ad sive symptoms, homelessness, and doses of antiretroviral therapy per day by level of alcohol consumption in the prior 30 days. Drinkers were more likely to use cocaine and heroin in the prior 30 days compared with nondrinkers. Additionally, worse adherence was associated with in\u00ad creased alcohol consumption, with abstainers being signif\u00ad icantly more likely to report 100% adherence than moder\u00ad ate or at risk drinkers (76% vs. 57% vs. 42%, p = 0.0004). Among the 267 subjects, a total of 798 interviews were conducted during the study period in which subjects were receiving HAART and had complete data on all predictors. The results of the multivariable longitudinal regression ~odel of factors associated with adherence are presented In Table 3. We found no association between the odds of being fUl1~ ~dherent and gender (p = 0.80), age (p = 0.23), race/ethnicity (p = 0.55), recent use of heroin (p = 0.23), recent use of cocaine (p = 0.19), and involvement in the ADHER~ study (p = 0.85). There were no significant c~anges In adherence over time (p = 0.97). Subjects with higher CES-D scores (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.97-0.996) and doses of HAART per day (AOR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.78\u00ad 0.97) had significantlyworse adherence. Subjects with more social support from friends reported significantly better odds of being fully adherent (AOR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.02-1.11). Alcohol consumption was an important predic\u00ad tor of adherence (p < 0.0001), with better odds of adher\u00ad ence being associated with recent abstinence from alcohol compared with at-risk level usage (AOR = 3.6, 95% CI :': 2.1-6.2). Abstainers also reported significantly better ad\u00ad herence compared with moderate users (AOR = 3.0, 95% CI = 2.0-4.5). There were no significant differences be\u00ad tween moderate and at-risk use (p = 0.47). DISCUSSION Among our sample of HIV-infected persons with a his\u00ad tory of alcohol problems, we found that alcohol was the most significant predictor of adherence, with better adher\u00ad ence being associated with recent abstinence from alcohol c~mpared with moderate or at-risk level usage. Although higher CES-D scores (more depressive symptoms) and in\u00ad c~eased ?oses of HAART per day were significantly asso\u00ad cIa~ed WIth decreased adherence, alcohol consumption re\u00ad mained the most significant factor associated with adherence. Additionally, worse adherence to HAART oc\u00ad curred regardless of whether the alcohol consumption was at the moderate or at-risk level. Thus, among HIV-infected persons with a history of alcohol problems, there was no 575 ADHERENCE, HAART, AND ALCOHOL Table 2.

Alcohol consumption among persons with HIV has re\u00ad ceived increased attention due to the relevant behavioral and clinical issues that arise with respect to disease pro\u00ad gression and adherence to HAART (Bagby et al., 2003; Miguez et al., 2003; Samet et al., 2003). Studies have sug\u00ad gested that the prevalence of alcohol abuse or dependence ranges from 20% to 40% among HIV-infected primary care patients (Cook et al., 2001; Lefevre et al., 1995). Cook et al. (2001) found that problem drinking was mildly associated with missed doses and significantly associated with taking medications off schedule. This is consistent with our find\u00ad ings that at-risk drinking and moderate drinking are asso\u00ad ciated with worse adherence. We also found significantly worse adherence among both moderate and at-risk drink\u00ad ers in comparison to abstainers in contrast to Cook et al. (2001), who reported no significant difference in medica\u00ad tion adherence among abstainers and mild-to-moderate drinkers. Another study of 140 HIV-infected patients at a county hospital found that alcohol use was independently associated with worse adherence. After adjusting for demo\u00ad graphic and clinical factors, patients actively using drugs took 59% of doses vs 72% for nonusers, and those drinking alcohol took 66% of doses vs. 74% for nondrinkers (Golin et al., 2002). One small (n = 94) study compared the virological out\u00ad comes of HIV-infected patients receiving HAART by their daily alcohol intake; they found no significant difference in the proportion of patients who achieved HIV-1 RNA sup\u00ad pression (Fabris et al., 2000). Another study of 220 HIV\u00ad infected drug users found that the prevalence of heavy alcohol consumption, defined as daily or three to four times per week, was 63%. Heavy alcohol users were more likely to be male and between 35 and 45 years of age. Compared with light or nondrinkers, heavy alcohol users receiving antiretroviral therapy were more likely to have CD4 counts below 500 cells/ILl and less likely to achieve virological suppression (Miguez et al., 2003). Furthermore, given the prevalence of hepatitis C and HIV coinfection among drug users, those who use alcohol not only may be less likely to adhere to antiretroviral therapy for behavioral reasons but also may be less able to tolerate antiretroviral therapy due to hepatotoxicity (Sulkowski et al., 2000). Depressive symptoms are prevalent among HIV-infected persons (Kilbourne et al., 2002) and have been reported to adversely affect adherence to HAART (Paterson et al., 2000; Turner et al., 2003), and this is consistent with our findings. Turner et al. (2003) studied factors associated with pharmacy-measured adherence to HAART in more than 5,000 drug users through the New York State Medic\u00ad aid program. They found that women were less adherent than men and were more likely to be diagnosed with de\u00ad pression (34% vs. 29%). Our finding that an increased number of doses of therapy per day was negatively associ\u00ad ated with adherence has also been noted elsewhere (Am\u00ad massari et al., 2002; Golin et al., 2002; Stone et al., 2001) 576 SAMET ET AL. and highlights the need for simplified antiretroviral regimens. Evidence for effective brief interventions among prob\u00ad lem drinkers who are not HIV infected demonstrates that alcohol consumption should be perceived as a potential modifiable risk factor for poor adherence to HAART. Strategies for addressing alcohol use include presenting the negative consequences of alcohol use to the individual with risky drinking (Fleming et al., 1997; Ockene et al., 1999; Samet et al., 1996). Negative consequences of at-risk drink\u00ad ing and possibly any alcohol use among patients with a history of alcohol problems include poor HAART adherence. This study has several limitations. Self-reported adher\u00ad ence tends to be overestimated, although in one study self-reported adherence among drug users was highly cor\u00ad related with adherence as measured by medication event monitoring systems and was also correlated with HIV-1 RNA suppression (Arnsten et al., 2001). There is currently no gold standard for adherence, and although medication event monitoring systems may be more accurate than self\u00ad report, they can underestimate adherence and may be dif\u00ad ficult to use in a clinical population as opposed to a med\u00ad ication trial (Samet et al. 2001). In summary, we found that better adherence to HAART was associated with recent abstinence from alcohol com\u00ad pared with moderate or at-risk level usage among HIV\u00b7 infected persons with alcohol problems. Alcohol consump\u00ad tion was the most significant factor associated with medication adherence in patients with alcohol problems. This study result is a significant advance in that it examines adherence to HAART in a detailed fashion in a population at high risk for poor adherence, namely those with alcohol problems. These findings also argue that with regard to adherence to HAART there may be no safe level of drink\u00ad ing among patients with a history of alcohol problems. In patients like these, alcohol consumption and medication adherence should both be closely monitored. The risk for suboptimal adherence to HAART when any amount of alcohol is used among patients with a history of alcohol problems should be explicitly discussed when reviewing the use of antiretroviral medications.

FREEDBERG 4 ABSTRACT The HIV epidemic has been consistently associated with injection drug use and crack cocaine, but alcohol problems in HIV-infected persons are less well described. Our objectives were 2-fold: (1) to assess the preva- lence of alcohol problems in HIV-infected patients initiating medical care; and (2) to determine the positive predictive value of the CAGE questionnaire for alcohol abuse or dependence in HIV-infected patients. Be- tween July 1997 and October 2000, we assessed a consecutive series of patients who were establishing pri- mary care for HIV infection (clinic sample), using an established alcohol screening test, the CAGE question- naire. In addition, we enrolled other HIV-infected patients, including some of the clinic sample, who had two or more positive responses to the CAGE questionnaire into a longitudinal cohort (cohort sample), performed a diagnostic interview for lifetime history of alcohol abuse and dependence, and determined the positive pre- dictive value of CAGE for alcohol diagnoses. In the clinic sample ( n5664), 42% (276 of 664) had two or more positive responses to the four CAGE questions. In the cohort sample ( n5141), 95% (134 of 141) met DSM-IV criteria for diagnosis of lifetime alcohol abuse or dependence. For patients initiating HIV primary care, a history of alcohol problems is very common. The CAGE questionnaire identifies a lifetime history of alcohol abuse or dependence in HIV-infected patients. Routine screening for alcohol problems should be per- formed in all patients entering HIV medical care and the CAGE questions are useful in this setting. 151INTRODUCTION FOR THE PAST TWO DECADES , focus on the association be- tween HIV infection and substance abuse has been directed primarily at the injection of opioids and cocaine 1and the use of crack cocaine. 2Although alcohol is a more common sub- stance of abuse in the United States than illicit drugs, its role in HIV infection and disease has received more limited atten- tion. Because alcohol use influences HIV infection in several key ways, the role of screening for alcohol use disorders is an important clinical issue. Alcohol use is known to be related to high-risk sexual be- havior,3and alcohol dependence is a known risk factor for HIV infection, as seen in studies of patients in alcohol treatment units in New York and San Francisco, where 5- 10% of clients had HIV infection, a prevalence not fully attributable to injection drug use.4,5Additionally, alcohol use has been associated with decreased adherence to antiretroviral medications 6,7and in-creased clinical comorbidities of HIV infection. 8Finally, alco- hol use has been shown to be associated with HIV progression among patients on antiretroviral therapy. 9 The prevalence of alcohol problems in general non-HIV pri- mary care populations has consistently revealed that 20- 30% of patients in primary care meet criteria for a diagnosis of past or present alcohol abuse or dependence. 10-12Despite the high prevalence of alcohol disorders and the substantial burden of disease known to accompany them, 13,14these problems are rec- ognized by medical providers in less than half of affected pa- tients.12,15- 17The importance of screening for alcohol problems in primary care has been recognized by the U.S. Preventive Ser- vices Task Force and is included in its list of recommended ac- tivities.18The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alco- holism (NIAAA) has set forth a guide for such interventions in routine clinical care. 19 Although the need to address alcohol problems in primary care populations has been well documented, the importance of Departments of 1Medicine and 2Social and Behavioral Sciences, Clinical Addiction Research and Education (CARE) Unit, Section of Gen- eral Internal Medicine, Boston University Schools of Medicine and Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts 02118. 3Department of Mathematics, Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts 01063. 4Division of General Medicine and Partners AIDS Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02114. assessing alcohol use among HIV-infected patients has been underappreciated . As the significance of alcohol use in HIV- infected patients becomes increasingly apparent, most notably in the context of antiretroviral medication adherence 20,21and risky sexual behaviors, 3,22this lack of attention to alcohol is- sues becomes more problematic. The CAGE questionnaire, an alcohol screening instrument recommended by NIAAA, has been examined extensively for use in primary care populations. 10,23It is used to assess a his- tory of alcohol abuse or dependence. In primary care popula- tions, two or more positive responses to the CAGE question- naire have documented sensitivity in the range of 73- 82% and specificity of approximately 90%. 10Its ease of administration and test characteristics make it a potentially valuable instrument for use among HIV-infected persons. In this study we charac- terize the prevalence of alcohol problems in HIV-infected pa- tients initiating primary medical care and examine the use of the CAGE questionnaire as a screening tool in this population. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study design We studied the prevalence of alcohol problems in a consec- utive series of HIV-infected patients at the time of initial physi- cian assessment (clinic sample). In a separate cohort (cohort sample), which included some of the clinic sample, we con- ducted an extensive assessment of subjects, including clinical diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence, as part of a longitu- dinal study. This study was approved by the Institutional Re- view Board of the Boston Medical Center. Study populations and assessment The clinic sample . We assessed all HIV-infected patients ini- tiating HIV-related primary care at Boston Medical Center be- tween July 1997 and October 2000 in the HIV Diagnostic Eval- uation Unit (DEU). The DEU was an intake and assessment clinic for HIV-infected persons without a physician in order to link them to primary care. Ongoing primary care was not pro- vided at this weekly clinic site. 24An attending physician used the CAGE questionnaire at the first visit to screen patients flu- ent in English or Spanish for alcohol problems as part of rou- tine clinical care. The CAGE questionnaire is comprised of the following four questions: Have you ever felt you should Cut down on your drinking? Have people Annoyed you by criticizing your drinking? Have you ever felt bad or Guilty about your drinking? Have you ever had a drink first thing in the morning to steady your nerves or get rid of a hangover ( Eye opener)? 25,26 Some studies recommend a cutoff of one or more positive re- sponses to raise suspicion of the presence of an alcohol prob- lem,19,25while others advocate a cutoff of two or more for a higher degree of specificity. 26We applied the more strict cut- off of two or more positive responses. The cohort sample . We assessed study participants enrolled in the longitudinal cohort study recruited from either the DEU or other Boston Medical Center Primary Care Clinics between July 1997 and July 2001. In addition to HIV infection and two positive responses to CAGE questions, entry criteria for the co- hort study included no definite plans to move from the study area in the next 2 years and a Mini-Mental State Examination 27 score of at least 21 (scale 0 to 30). After informed consent was obtained, study subjects underwent research interviews. Subjects enrolled in the longitudinal cohort study underwent multiple interviews. Demographic characteristics, primary HIV risk factor, self-reported liver problems, clinical laboratory val- ues, current alcohol consumption, and alcohol-related diagnoses by the alcohol section of the Composite International Diagnos- tic Interview (CIDI) were obtained. 28The CIDI is a standard- ized, structured interview developed collaboratively by an in- ternational team of researchers with the purpose of creating an epidemiological instrument to provide standardized diagnoses of psychiatric disorders, including alcohol dependence and abuse as defined by DSM-IV criteria.29The instrument has been shown to be reliable in many different cultures and reduces dis- crepancies among interviewers. 30This test has been used to generate a lifetime diagnosis of alcohol dependence or abuse. Trained interviewers administered the CIDI alcohol module in the context of this research study. Alcohol consumption was assessed by patient interview us- ing a series of standardized questions on alcohol use. The bat- tery included alcohol quantity and frequency questions and the Addiction Severity Index, an assessment instrument with well- documented reliability and validity, even among homeless per- sons.31To encourage truth telling about alcohol consumption, breath alcohol level was also measured. 32From this interview we determined if the subject was abstinent (\" none\" ), or met cri- teria for \" moderate\" or \" at-risk\" drinking, using the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism guideline for at- risk drinking of greater than 14 drinks per week (or more than four drinks per day) for men, and greater than seven drinks per week (or more than three drinks per day) for women. 33Alco- hol consumption below these levels was considered moderate use in this study. Self-report of health information was solicited; subjects were asked if a doctor had ever told them that they had hepatitis or liver disease, and if they were currently taking highly active an- tiretroviral therapy (HAART). We attempted to obtain CD4 cell counts and HIV RNA levels on all subjects. Laboratory tests performed within 6 months of the interview as part of clinical care were recorded. If not available through routine clinical care, blood samples were obtained and tested for CD4 cell count and HIV RNA using the Boston Medical Center Laboratory. Research associate s interviewe d subjects in English or Spanish. The Spanish interview instrument used the stan- dardized Spanish versions of scales when available. The re- mainder of the Spanish questionn aire was translated from the English version, back-tran slated to check for accuracy, and then corrected. Analysis Analyses were performed using PC SAS statistical software, version 8. Positive predictive value and exact 95% confidence intervals were estimated by determining the proportion of CAGE-positive patients who tested positive on the CIDI. SAMET ET AL. 152 RESULTS The clinic sample Of the 755 patients evaluated at the clinic during the study period, 715 (95%) spoke English or Spanish and are described in Table 1. Seventy percent of the sample were men and 77% were ethnic minorities. The most common HIV risk factor was injection drug use (47%); heterosexual sex was reported by 37% and men having sex with men (MSM) was reported by 16%. The average age of subjects was 39 years. Of these eligible pa- tients, 93% (664 of 715) were evaluated for alcohol problems with the CAGE questionnaire: 42% (276 of 664) (95% CI 38%, 45%) had two or more positive CAGE responses. Based on data from all patients administered the CAGE in the clinic, alcohol problems were more common in injection drug users (55% prevalence), however, they were also very common in patients with other risk behaviors. Among MSM, 30% had a positive CAGE, as did 30% of those with hetero- sexual risk. The cohort sample The characteristics of the 141 patients in the cohort sample are outlined in Table 2. Eighty-five percent of patients were men and 74% were ethnic minorities. The most common HIV risk factor was injection drug use (65%); heterosexual sex was reported by 23% and MSM by 12%. The average age of sub- jects was 41 years. Subjects did not differ by demographics, substance use, or HIV disease markers based on site of enroll- ment. Of the 141 patients in the cohort sample, 95% (95% CI 90%, 98%) met DSM-IV criteria for diagnosis of either lifetime al- cohol abuse or dependence; 113 of 141 (80%) met criteria for dependence and 21 of 141 (15%) met criteria for abuse; 7 of 141 (5%) did not meet criteria for either dependence or abuse. Prevalence of a DSM-IV diagnosis of alcohol abuse or depen- dence among CAGE-positive patients was 98% (88 of 90) in patients with risk behavior injection drug use, and 90% (46 of 51) in patients with other risk behaviors. While diagnoses for current alcohol abuse or dependence were not obtained, 60 (43%) subjects reported current alcohol consumption: 16% of the cohort sample reported current at-risk drinking and an ad- ditional 27% current moderate drinking. DISCUSSION Although injection drug use dominates substance abuse dis- cussions regarding the AIDS epidemic, appreciation of the role of alcohol in HIV infection is increasing. Alcohol use is an im- portant patient characteristic related to several key HIV-related clinical issues including prevention strategies, 34linkage to med- ical care,35and the use of antiretroviral therapy. 6Antiretrovi- ral usage may be limited due to interactions between alcohol and certain medications, including didanosine, zalcitabine, and stavudine. In addition, alcohol consumption is associated with decreased adherence to antiretroviral therapy and other treat- ment regimens, 36-38the effectiveness of which is predicated upon an extremely high level of adherence. 39 In addition to limiting treatment options, alcohol use may disrupt other aspects of HIV care. Diseases aggravated by al- cohol use often overlap those associated with HIV, including hepatitis, pancreatitis, peripheral neuropathy, and bacterial pneumonia.8Excessive alcohol use may be an important exac- erbating factor in the clinical course of an individual with such comorbidities. Hepatitis C, a common coinfection with HIV, is ALCOHOL PROBLEMS IN HIV-INFECTED PATIENTS 153 TABLE 1.CHARACTER ISTICS OF HIV-I NFECTED PATIENTS SEEN AT THEHIV DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION UNIT(DEU) BETWEEN JULY 1997 AND OCTOBER 2000 AND ELIGIBLE FORASSESSME NT FOR ALCOHOL PROBLEMS (n 5715) Characteristic n(%) Gender Male 498 (70%) Female 217 (30%) Race Black 357 (50%) Latino 179 (25%) White 163 (23%) Other 16 (2%) Primary HIV risk factor a Injection drug use 334 (47%) Heterosexual 266 (37%) Men who have sex with men 112 (16%) Age (mean, years) 39 aInformation available on n5712.TABLE 2.CHARACTER ISTICS OF HIV-I NFECTED PATIENTS ENROLLED INLONGITUDINA L COHORT STUDY BETWEEN JULY 1997 AND JULY 2001 (n 5141) Characteristic n(%) Gender Male 120 (85%) Female 21 (15%) Race Black 68 (48%) White 37 (26%) Other 36 (26%) Primary HIV risk factor Injection drug use 92 (65%) Heterosexual 32 (23%) Men who have sex with men 17 (12%) Age (mean, years) 41 CIDI DSM-IV lifetime alcohol diagnosis No diagnosis 7 (5%) Abuse 21 (15%) Dependence 113 (80%) Current drinking a Abstinent 80 (57%) Moderate 38 (27%) At risk 22 (16%) Current use of HAART 77 (55%) Liver Hepatitisb49 (35%) aInformation available on n5140. bSelf-report. adversely affected by excessive alcohol use, resulting in more rapid and frequent progression to cirrhosis. 40 The CAGE questionnaire, a standard test for the presence of a lifetime history of alcohol abuse or dependence, detected a substantial number (42%) of HIV-infected patients with two or more positive CAGE responses in the clinic sample. Alcohol problems are more common in this population than the 20- 30% prevalence estimated in non-HIV primary care settings. 11,12 These findings are consistent with those found in a smaller sam- ple of 111 mostly white HIV-infected patients from a univer- sity hospital in the Midwestern United States in which 41% were categorized as having alcoholism according to the Michi- gan Alcohol Screening Test. 41 The CAGE questionnaire, a simple, inexpensive screening test that takes less than 1 minute to administer, yielded a pos- itive predictive value of 95% for a lifetime diagnosis of alco- hol problems. This result is consistent with test characteristics previously reported for the CAGE questionnaire in other set- tings, with studies publishing a sensitivity of 74- 75%, speci- ficity of 91- 96%, and positive predictive value of 82% for the CAGE, using a two-positive response cutoff. 10,42The higher positive predictive value in this study is likely due to a greater prevalence of alcohol problems in this population than in the outpatient populations surveyed in earlier studies (estimated at 36% and 20%, respectively). The CAGE screening test detects a lifetime history of alco- hol problems. We also found that 16% of those interviewed re- ported at-risk drinking in the prior 30 days, and 27% reported moderate drinking in the prior 30 days. Addressing alcohol use in these patients is crucial because of its impact on many as- pects of HIV care. In addition, knowledge of a prior history of an alcohol problem is an important component of the clinical history, since recognition of the success of people in recovery from alcohol problems is described as an essential aspect of clinical care. 43,44 This study has several limitations. We are not able to ex- amine the sensitivity or specificity of the alcohol screening in- strument, since patients who did not meet the CAGE two or more criteria were not administered the full diagnostic inter- view. Also, as the CAGE screening test is reportedly 70- 80% sensitive, the 42% prevalence of alcohol problems in the clinic sample is likely an underestimation. Another limitation is the study' s reliance on the clinic sample drawn from a single ur- ban clinic that is not necessarily representative of all HIV-in- fected persons in the United States. A disproportionately high number of subjects had injection drug use as an HIV risk be- havior, and alcohol use is common in drug users. However, the presence of a lifetime history of alcohol abuse or dependence was not found solely in those HIV-infected patients with a his- tory of injection drug use. Alcohol problems were found com- monly in all HIV-infected patient subgroups in this urban hos- pital. Many concerns demand attention in the HIV patient initiat- ing medical care, including clinical, social, and family issues. However, the prevalence of alcohol problems found in this study coupled with the alcohol-associated clinical problems de- scribed in the medical literature strongly suggests that alcohol screening merits inclusion in the standard initial assessment of all HIV-infected patients. 45With at least 95% adherence with antiretroviral therapy as the goal for all treated HIV-infected patients,39physician knowledge of a patient' s history of alco- hol use is imperative. The CAGE test accurately identifies pa- tients with alcohol problems and requires a minimal time com- mitment on the part of clinicians. Alcohol is clearly the \" other substance\" affecting the lives of HIV-infected patients, and rou- tine screening for alcohol problems for all patients initiating medical care for HIV infection should be done.

Saitz et al. assessed 5,824 persons presenting for substance abuse treatment in a public substance . abuse treatment system and found that 41 % did not have a physician. 9 One model for providing primary care to this population is a distributive model in which patients in substance abuse treatment are referred to existing medical care.410-14 This model is less expensive, likely more appealing to pa\u00ad tients in recovery, and more easily replicable in the existing US health care system than the integrative approach (e.g., medical care provided on-site at a 35 Sweeney et at. specialty substance abuse treatment prograrnj.> However, the integrative ap\u00ad proach has the advantage of bringing care to the patients. Primary care for sub\u00ad stance abusers should be comprehensive and continuous; it should contribute to preventing or minimizing complications, providing early treatment of med\u00ad ical problems and assisting in the care of substance abuse issues.f This paper describes the establishment of a novel mixed-\"integrative-dis\u00ad tributive\" approach to link patients undergoing residential detoxification for alcohol and drug problems to primary medical care. This approach, a multi\u00ad disciplinary medical clinic in a freestanding, urban detoxification center, was called the Health Evaluation and Linkage to Primary care (HELP) clinic. The purpose of the clinic was to involve inpatients at the substance abuse detoxifi\u00ad cation facility in a single, initial, comprehensive health evaluation and then ar\u00ad range subsequent follow-up with a primary care physician and ongoing health care. METHODS This is a descripti ve report of the development of a novel, multidisciplinary clinicin adetoxification unit, and ofcohortofpatientsevaluated therein. The HELP clinic was designed based on a comparable hospital-based clinic, the HIV Diagnostic Evaluation Unit l5 where HIV-infected patients without pri\u00ad mary care are assessed by a multidisciplinary team, and linked with a primary care clinician. The three main clinical purposes of the HELP clinic were to provide for the patient: (1) multidisciplinary assessment; (2) education that underscored the importance of establishing primary medical care; and (3) re\u00ad ferral for continuing medical care with a primary care clinician. Patients Patients evaluated in the HELP clinic were subjects randomized to the in\u00ad tervention group in a clinical trial. Enrollment details are reported else\u00ad where.16All subjects were recruited at least 24 hours after admission to a free\u00ad standing residential detoxification unit in Boston, Massachusetts between June I, 1997 and April 1, 1999 and had the following characteristics: (1) alco\u00ad hol, heroin or cocaine asafirstorsecond drug ofchoice; (2)age over 17years; (3) lived or planned to live in the Boston Medical Center (BMC) catchment area (the site at which primary care was to be arranged) or homelessness. Exclusions were: (1) an established primary care relationship that the indi\u00ad vidual intended to continue; (2) mental status deficiencies; (3) specific plans to leave the Boston area in the next 12 months; (4) inability to provide three contact names; (5) pregnancy; and (6) not fluent in English or Spanish. Sub\u00ad jects (a maximum of 4 per session) were assigned to attend the next available .. JOURNAL OF ADDICTIVE DISEASES 36 clinic session after enrollment. Trained staff researchers interviewed subjects to assess demographics, drug use, and history of preventive care testing (HIV test, Pap smear), as part of a more extensive research interview. 16 HELP Clinic Data Collection, Outcomes and Analysis A HELP clinic log recorded all phone calls, letters, and face-to-face con\u00ad tacts with patients after the clinic, and documented all time spent in 5-minute increments. The log also recorded primary care appointments scheduled, whether or not they were kept, and patient reasons for missed appointments. Patients signed a separate consent form for vaccination. This form was used to track receipt of vaccines. At the end of patient recruitment we reviewedHlil.P clinic records to identify clinic assessments and interventions. Completion of . patient primary care appointments was tracked for two years using administra\u00ad tive data (the hospital's appointment scheduling system), patient contact by telephone and/or mail, and contact with primary care offices outside of BMC by the social worker. Descriptive statistics (mean \u00b1 SD for continuous vari\u00ad ables, and proportions for dichotomous variables) are used to present results. RESULTS Implementation ofthe HELP Clinic The HELP clinic met two afternoons each week in dedicated, sparsely equipped space within the confines of the detoxification unit. This detoxifica\u00ad tion unit was freestanding, not for profit, and space and clinical amenities were limited. Although a physician provided standing detoxification orders, no comprehensive or ongoing medical services were routinely provided. Coun\u00ad selors and nurses focused on detoxification services, there was no social worker to provide either concrete or therapeutic services. The clinical team in\u00ad cluded a physician trained in internal medicine [authors JHS, RS, and 3 oth\u00ad ers], a registered nurse [LPS], and a social worker. Each member of the HELP team was trained in a full day session in the principles of motivational inter\u00ad viewing by one of the study investigators with prior training as trainers in these methods [JHS, RS].17 The session consisted primarily of role play of pa\u00ad tients with substance dependence with the goal ofprimary care linkage, after a didactic description of the principles of motivational interviewing and advice to read the relevanttext. 17Each memberoftheHELPteam used briefmotiva-. . tional counseling approaches to address substance dependence and linkage .with primary medical care. Each clinician was allocated 30 minutes with each patient. The HELP clinic nurse loca!ed patients randomized to the clinic, many of whom were sleeping 37 Sweeney et al. or reluctant to participate, and escorted them to the clinic. The nurse obtained a standardized health history including a review of the patient's medical, surgi\u00ad cal and physical trauma history. Patients were asked about testicular or breast self-exam (TSFJBSE), tuberculosis infection, medications used, number of meals each day, amount of fat in the diet, consumption of fruits and vegeta\u00ad bles, any regular exercise routine, amount of regular walking or physical la- . bor, use of condoms and contraceptives, HIVtesting, and knowledge and\u00b7 practice of needle sharing, bleaching or exchange. They were asked about family history of cancer, heart disease and other illness, involvement as a vic\u00ad tim;witness orperpetrator ofinterpersonalviolenceasachildoradult;psychiatric hospitalization, outpatient treatment and history of or presence of homicidall suicidal attempts or ideation. Those with current suicide or homicide risk were immediately referred to the HELP clinic social worker, who would refer to the detoxification unit counseling staff. Vital signs, height, and weight were mea\u00ad sured. Patients were offered TSFJBSE \"shower cards\" (plastic cards which could be hung where one would be reminded frequently and which gave visual and verbal instructions in English and Spanish), HIV and needle cleansing written materials and condoms. Patients were offered and given pneumococcal vaccination if they had not previously had it. The nurse highlighted issues of concern for physician attention. The physician then reviewed and expanded upon the medical history and performed a physical examination. Medical issues requiring immediate atten\u00ad tion were referred to a nearby urgent care center. Identified medical issues were discussed with the patient, with particular emphasis on those of interest to the patient related to addiction and/or requiring ongoing medical care. Lab\u00ad oratory testing was not done routinely, both to minimize the cost of the clinic, and because these tests could be included as part of a recommended plan for the receiving primary care physician. Urine dipstick and stool guaiac testing were done when indicated by symptoms. The social worker then obtained the patient's psychosocial history includ\u00ad ing demographics necessary to register and schedule a primary care appoint\u00ad ment, review of government benefits, employment, housing, marital and parenting status, substance abuse, treatment and recovery history, discharge plans, psychiatric history. legal issues involving child support, criminal in\u00ad volvement. immigration issues and history of primary medical care. Much of this interview focused on concrete needs (food stamps, housing. legal issues) and available resources were offered to the patient, including referrals and phone calls made on the patient's behalf. Aside from notifying detoxification unit staff of any urgent medical issues (e.g., excessive sedation. hypotension. urinary tract infection) the HELP clinic staff did not playa role in the detoxification per se, which included treatment JOURNAL OF ADDICTIVE DISEASES 38 with long acting benzodiazepines, buprenorphine, methadone and/or other symptomatic treatments as appropriate. Scheduling Primary Care Appointments. Primary care appointments were generally scheduled by the social worker at the adult medicine primary care clinic of a medical center, staffed by over 100 resident and attending physi\u00ad cians (including the HELP clinic physicians) and nurse practitioners. This in\u00ad ner city academic center clinic saw 15,000 unique patients in 45,000 visits annually during the study period (regardless of ability to pay). In order to avoid the usual 3-month wait, the primary care clinic reserved a block of appointments for the HELP clinic patients. Appointments were scheduled with an attending physician or with a first or second year resident physician in a l-year internal medicine training program. Patients provided preferences about the gender of the physician, time of appointment, language (English or Spanish) or specific physician if they knew one, which were gener\u00ad ally accommodated. Dates of appointments were assigned with attention to patient discharge plans. Often patients were going on for further substance abuse treatment; in such scenarios they were often not allowed to attend any outside appointments from two weeks to three months. Patients could also choose specialty primary care clinics: a Latino Clinic with all Spanish speak\u00ad ing staff, a clinic with staff familiar with the specific needs of homeless peo\u00ad ple, and a clinic for those with HIV infection. Patients were sometimes able to schedule appointments with the same physician seen at the HELP clinic, and those with any interest in methadone treatment were offered an appointment with a primary care physician who was also a HELP clinic physician and a methadone clinic medical director. The patient was then given an appointment card with the name and number of the HELP clinic social worker as well as the name, phone number, appointment date, time and location of the new primary care physician. When a patient had a strong preference for care at another fa\u00ad cility (a rare occurrence), the appointment was scheduled there. Patients going on for further addiction treatment were given a letter to take with them about' the appointment. Partial Exposure to the HELP Clinic. Since the clinic was twice a week, not daily, if a patient planned to leave the detoxification program before the HELP clinic, the nurse or social worker attempted to assess the individual's needs, discuss the value of establishing primary medical care, obtain medical and psychosocial history and arrange a primary care appointment. At times no contact was possible or only a primary care appointment was provided. Multidisciplinary Referral. The team sent a physician-dictated referral let\u00ad ter to the primary care clinician based on the HELP clinic assessment including pertinent history, exam findings and specific recommendations for follow-up medical and addiction care. 39 Sweeney et al. Follow-Up. The social worker served in a case management role to facili\u00ad tate linkage of patients to primary care. There was no limit to the number of primary care appointments made; active efforts continued for one year or until the appointment was kept. This role included patient contact by phone, mail and face-to-face contacts after discharge from the detoxification unit. The so\u00ad cial worker also attempted to contact the patient's family and friends, if neces\u00ad sary. The face-to-face contact occurred in both unscheduled and scheduled meetings at the medical center or if the subject returned to the detoxification program. Patients were contacted through family, friends, community ser\u00ad vices; homeless shelters, treatment facilities, and other institutions. Letters in\u00ad cluded reminders prior to appointments, letters for missed appointments and a holiday letter to those who had not kept a primary care appointment. Patient Participation in the HELP Clinic. Of the 235 individuals assigned to attend the HELP clinic, 220 (94%) received some component of the HELp\u00b7 clinic. Most (178/235, 76%) attended the clinic as designed, which included the health history, physical exam, psychosocial evaluation and primary care appointment scheduling. Some (351235, 15%) received only social work or nursing evaluation and primary care appointment scheduling. A few (71220, 3%) received only a primary care appointment and 15/235 (6%) did not re\u00ad ceive any of the clinic components, having left the detoxification program be\u00ad tween the time of assignment and the next scheduled clinic; three of this latter group scheduled and kept a primary care appointment themselves. Patients and Outcomes Ofthe 220 patients who received some component ofthe HELP clinic, 75% were male, 47% African-American, 38% stated cocaine, and 33% alcohol as their 1st drug of choice (Table I). The majority (57%) was employed during the previous year, but more than half (55%) of patients earned less than $20,000 in anyone of the previous 5 years. A third (33%) of the patients spent at least a night in jail during the previous 6 months and 47% had spent at least one night in a homeless shelter or on the street in the previous 6 months. Al\u00ad though all patients were without a primary care relationship, the majority had obtained some routine health screening. Of the women in the study, 96% had a Pap smear in the past 3 years and most patients (73%) had been tested for HIV in the past. Almost all 178 patients attending a HELP clinic had health behaviors ad\u00ad dressed by assessment and counseling by clinic staff (Table 2). A significant minority (28%) received pneumococcal vaccination. A total of 401 appoint\u00ad ments were scheduled for the 220 patients who had any contact with the HELP clinic. Of those 220 scheduled for at least one primary care appointment, 100% were verified by clinic staff; 131/220 (60%) linked to primary care in 40 JOURNAL OF ADDICTIVE DISEASES TABLE 1.

The majority 110/131 (84%) of the patients who linked kept either the first or second appointment and 91/128 (71 %) did so within 60 days of discharge from the detoxification unit (for 3, the date of the appointment was unknown). The mean days from detoxification to primary care appointment kept were 58.5 days (range I day to 405 days). From I to 7 appointments were scheduled per patient (mean 1.68). Most (70%) were with the general primary care clinic, 21% were with the homeless clinic and much smaller numbers were in the other specialized primary care clinics, including 9 (2%) who chose to have appointments made at another facility. Of the appoint- . ments that were not kept (n = 270), most (63%) were no shows; the patient canceled 67 (25%), and 32 (12%) were canceled by the practice. Of the 96 pa\u00ad tients who reported reasons for missing 156 of these appointments, the most common reasons were: primary care appointment scheduling and office prob\u00ad41 Sweeney et al. TABLE 2.

Case management efforts to link patients with primary care were greater for those who never linked with pri\u00ad mary care; patients who linked required a median of7 phone calls, 1 letter, and 45 minutes ofHELP clinic staffeffortaftertheinitialHELPclinic visit(Table3). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS As hypothesized, we found that it is feasible to establish a clinic to begin to address the medical and psychosocial needs of patients with addictions while they are in residential detoxification by multidisciplinary assessment andre\u00ad ferral to primary medical care. As reported elsewhere, almost half of the sub\u00ad jects in this study had chronic medical problems such as hypertension and asthma. 18 We also found that patients referred attended such a clinic, and most com\u00ad pleted the 9O-minute session. The majority of these patients without primary medical care received health risk behavior counseling, a significant proportion received the indicated pneumococcal vaccination, and 60% linked with pri\u00ad mary medical care. And efforts to facilitate linkage beyond the initial clinic were modest. Patients able to specify why they missed a scheduled primary care appointment most commonly reported the following reasons: employ\u00ad ment, being in addiction treatment, using alcohol or drugs, legal issues, and primary care office scheduling. 42 .

This study had several strengths as a test of feasibility. First, the clinic was based on a previously successful model.P Second, the clinic was brought to patients rather than having patients come to the clinic, and it was done at a reachable moment-during a residential detoxification. Third, the clinic staff used standardized forms and approaches to patient evaluation and data record\u00ad ing, and they were trained in motivational interviewing, implementing this counseling style as they addressed linkage to primary care with patients. Lastly, for linkage, the follow-up was 100% since appointments records were derived from the administrative data at one medical center (and a small num- . ber elsewhere that were confirmed individually by telephone). The study also has limitations. The primary limitation is generalizability. The applicability of our findings may be limited to uninsured urban popula\u00ad tions without primary medical care at residential detoxification units. How\u00ad ever, if effective in such a challenging population, it suggests efficacy-if more broadly applied. Any replication of this clinic will require linkage with a pri\u00ad mary care site that cares for patients regardless of ability to pay. Another limi\u00ad tation that should be considered in interpreting our results is the fact that subjects were compensated to enroll in the randomized trial in which a re\u00ad search intervention (HELP clinic) occurred. However, they were not specifi\u00ad cally compensated to attend the clinic, and in fact, almost one quarter did not receive all clinic components, and some received none. Lastly, caution should Sweeney et al. 43 be used in drawing conclusions regarding the efficacy of the clinic because this report is of a prospective cohort, not the results of a randomized trial. But during the HELP clinic, health behavior counseling and vaccination that would not have occurred at all on-site at the detoxification unit was delivered. In addition, the high proportion of inner city adults with addictions, without primary medical care, and with markers indicating low socioeconomic status who in fact linked with primary care is remarkable, and higher than expected.. We are not aware of reports of examples of any other mixed \"integra\u00ad tive-distributive\" models for linking patients with addictions to primary medi\u00ad cal care. The current US health care system primarily relies on a distributive model, in which detoxification patients are referred to medical care elsewhere. With this predominant model, patients with addictions often do not receive comprehensive, longitudinal primary care; rather they use medical care epi\u00ad sodically for urgent problems. I 9,20 The integrative model, or \"one-stop shop\u00ad ping\" in which all services (e.g., medical and addiction) are delivered on site, has been tried. In one randomized trial, integrated care was associated with in\u00ad creased abstinence in patients who had substance abuse-related medical con\u00ad ditions.U In another, veterans with alcohol dependence who received integrated care were more likely to be abstinent. 13 And although high rates of service de\u00ad livery have been associated with this method,22,23 the model has not been widely adopted, perhaps due to cost concerns (need to duplicate primary care delivery at addiction treatment units), and concerns about continuing primary care at a treatment unit after the patient is in a more stable recovery. Our ap\u00ad proach combines the convenience of on-site initial delivery, with integration into the existing primary care system once linked. We speculate that the cost of implementing our approach would be between the integrative and distribu\u00ad tive approaches since it requires on-site staff and space, but not for all medical care. This approach, if proven efficacious, may have a greater chance at wide\u00ad spread implementation since it requires less change in the health system, likely will cost less, and borrows features from integrative approaches that are re\u00ad sponsible for efficacy, at least in the short-term. A randomized clinical trial of implementation of the HELP clinic addressed the question of efficacy, show\u00ad ing that linkage can be increased. 16 As a result, policymakers may wish to con\u00ad sider establishing HELP clinics in detoxification units. The fact that many patients with addictions do not have primary medical care at all suggests inter\u00ad ventions are needed. In addition to the demonstration of feasibility and its implications, our data provide some insight into reasons why patients with addictions miss primary care appointments. Prior studies addressing barriers to medical care for pa\u00ad tients in addictions treatment have identified transportation as a key bar\u00ad rier24,25 and program and health system characteristics.f In this single system, several reasons for missed appointments (in addition to relapse) surfaced as JOURNAL OF ADDICTIVE DISEASES 44 important considerations when designing strategies to link patients with pri\u00ad . mary care. As with the general population, employment can be a barrier to at\u00ad tending a medical visit. We speculate that in this population, patients of lower socioeconomic status, and those with work consequences from their addic\u00ad tions may have even greater difficulty than the general population in taking time away from a job to see the doctor. Similarly, patients with addictions may have greater difficulty rescheduling and negotiating the system when a physi\u00ad cian's office cancels or reschedules. A barrier that was unanticipated deserves .particular attention: substance abuse treatment. In treatment, soon after detox\u00ad ification, many programs restricted contact that patients could have with the \"outside world.\" These restrictions applied to medical appointments (unless they were urgent). These barriers would all certainly be addressable in 'future interventions. We conclude that many patients with addictions who do not have primary medical care, but who do have significant medical needs, can be identified and can have a medical and psychosocial evaluation and initial preventive inter\u00ad ventions when they are admitted for detoxification. Such an intervention has been shown to improve linkage with primary medical care. 16 It remains to be determined whether addressing barriers we identified will improve linkage, and whether linkage itself will improve health and health care utilization.

Managing the Community Response to Bioterrorist Threats Crisis Health Risk Self-Assessment Tools to Triage the Patient Surge VICTOR W. WEEDN, MICHAEL D. McDONALD, STEVEN E. LOCKE, MERRITT SCHREIBER, ROBERT H. FRIEDMAN, RICHARD G. NEWELL, AND L VDIA R. TEMOSHOK Addressing the psychological and behavioral after\u00ad effects of bioterrorism has emerged as a central but relatively neglected component of the National Bioterrorism Response effort. The sig\u00ad nificant public health challenges surrounding the potential psychosocial effects of bioterrorism were highlighted in the aftermath of 9/11; the anthrax attacks in Florida, New York, and Washington during 2001; national reports from the Institute of Medicine, Secretary's Emergency Public Information and Communication Advisory Board, and the National Advisory Board for Children and Terrorism; and compounded by results of several national exercises such as TOPOFF 2 and Dark Winter. The psychosocial impacts of bioterrorist events are diverse and pervasive, extending far beyond those victims who are exposed and ill to include those individuals who perceive themselves or their family members as threatened or affected by the agent. Psychosocial effects are manifest across a spec\u00ad trum of disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder, panic, specific fears, and \"psychogenic illness\" with symp\u00ad toms that may mimic those associated with various chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear explosive (CBRNE) agents [1]. These phenomena have been described as multi\u00ad ple unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS) [2], idiopathic psychosomatic illness, disaster somatization reaction [3] the past, as \"worried well,\" a serious misnomer given that the overwhelming anxiety of such individuals hardly consti\u00ad tutes \"wellness.\" When such reactions occur in large num\u00ad bers of people, the phenomenon has been called \"mass psychogenic illness\" [4]. Experience with CBRNE incidents to date has shown that the great proportion of individuals seeking care (the so-called \"surge\") have in fact had no known direct exposure whatsoev\u00ad er but have been stimulated by media reports. For example, in the aftermath of the Tokyo sarin attack of 1995, approximately 88% of the medical emergency visits (4,500 of the 5,100) were of individuals who feared that they had been exposed but for whom no exposure was determined [5]. Similarly, follow\u00ad ing the death of four children who accidentally ingested dis\u00ad carded medical isotopes, over 100,000 individuals were screened, and approximately 5,000 with no known exposure to the agent in question reported symptoms consistent with acute radiological poisoning [6]. Thus, in terrorist events with 162 IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY MAGAZINE CBRNE agents, the numbers of individuals who seek care in the absence of exposure may be orders of magnitude larger than the number of individuals seeking care who are actually exposed or ill, thus presenting a secondary public health impact and demand on emergency care systems beyond that of the CBRNE agent itself. The healthcare response required by acutely ill patients in need of emergency medical care and/or hospitalization could be seriously compromised by this patient surge [7]. In other words, MUPS patients-and an even greater number of con\u00ad cerned but nonexposed individuals-threaten to overwhelm the system and in turn create further secondary mass psycho\u00ad logical reactions, potentially delaying diagnosis and care for those actually exposed. From both the emergency manage\u00ad ment and public health standpoints, responses must be devel\u00ad oped to address this phenomenon. Although the impact of surge has been postulated and observed in national exercises, the management of the psychosocial and behavioral factors that contribute to surge has been largely overlooked in most terrorism preparedness and response planning. To date, no national emergency management and public health strategy has been articulated to prevent, mitigate, and manage these psychological/behavioral reactions as they relate to medical surge following terrorism events. Proposed Management of Patient Surge: Automated Crisis Health Risk self-Assessment Tools We will describe an armamentarium of automated crisis health risk self-assessment tools designed to address the CBRNE patient surge and form the basis for a community crisis aware\u00ad ness system. Harnessing the power of information technology (IT) yields the opportunity to reach the broad public in a suffi\u00ad ciently timely and efficient manner to deal with the over\u00ad whelming numbers of individuals who are likely to seek healthcare and information in the wake of bioterrorism. IT architectures can screen large numbers of individuals rapidly, efficiently, and uniformly; can apply sophisticated algorithms and heuristics to the problem of differential diagnosis; and can adapt to evolving information and situations on a real-time basis. We envision this IT screening system as only one com\u00ad ponent of a larger strategy to respond comprehensively to the various medical, psychological, and behavioral aspects of bioterrorism. When appropriately validated, the crisis health 0739-5175{04{S20.(X)y.1OO41EEE JANUARY {FEBRUARY 2004 cost-effec\u00ad lrO~I(':H~'iJqiinfonn BLIld educate the public uP:llgVllll\"iOllS phases of such emergencies. ::wc~.;plropIClse developing, adapting, and vali\u00ad self-assessment tools, a.screening tool to determine the likelihood of exposure and whether the symptoms appear to be more likely psychogenic or agent-based, and a personalized report to help the individual determine the likelihood of actu\u00ad al exposure and need for further information or human ser\u00ad vices. These tools will provide individuals with the capacity to assess their own symptoms and relative risk of illness from a particular event prior to or upon entry into the health\u00ad care system, thus diverting a portion of the nonexposed away from emergency and primary care settings towards other support systems and mental healthcare, One section of their personal report will provide referral information so that an individual can rapidly act on his or her most appropriate response options. The toolset can be designed to be cus\u00ad tomized and localized so that local jurisdictions can refer the public in a highly specific manner to the most optimal local services to address their particular medical, psychosocial, mental health, and/or informational service needs. The sys\u00ad tem could also assist in scheduling needed appointments. Thus, intelligent health risk self-assessment tools will facili\u00ad tate the distribution of patients across and within healthcare systems geographically and temporally, permitting public health systems and communities to more appropriately and effectively handle the \"surge,\" thus preventing regional healthcare provider systems from being overwhelmed. Particularly in the case of radiological and biological events, perceptions of risk and individuals' reactions to a terrorist attack will change over time. Such projected trajectories will be factored into the proposed system's algorithms on a real\u00ad time, as-needed basis. We envision a mature system composed of multiple stages of assessment over time, designed to take into consideration special populations with special needs, such as children, the disabled, the disenfranchised, the elderly, or other populations with special healthcare needs. Automated crisis health risk self-assessment tools could be deployed to homes, workplaces, schools, hospitals, or other community facilities through home computers, telephones, manned terminals, or some combination of these. The most obvious, easiest, and most powerful medium would be a Web site on the Internet accessible to individuals in their horne. Most individuals have telephones (98% of Americans), and the Web-based version could be mirrored on the phone system. National and local trusted communica\u00ad tors would increase the value and receptivity of these com\u00ad munications. Individuals who do not have computers or telephones could be directed through the media and word of mouth to public-access stations. Manned or unmanned health risk self-assessment stations could be set up at emergency room entrances, schools, or other disaster healthcare settings for those not remaining at horne. Moreover, an intelligent crisis health risk self-assessment toolset could be incorporated into a highly interactive and per\u00ad sonalized approach on the Web and through telephone-based interactive voice response (IVR) to provide additional value beyond present static media sources. For example, if the self\u00ad assessment results suggest that a person with dizziness has a likelihood of a psychogenic disorder, the program could pro\u00ad vide the following feedback: Ms. Smith, given your answers to this self-assessment, it is most likely that you have not been exposed but are understandably nervous about the possibility of con\u00ad tracting <anthrax>. Sometimes nervousness can cause symptoms of dizziness, and we suggest you take the fol\u00ad lowing anxiety relieving techniques ... An example of such an integrated assessment and interactive educational feedback system was developed in the early 1990s by the Behavioral Prevention Program of the U.S. Military's fllV Research Program. Interactive videodisk systems for at\u00ad risk and fllV-infected military personnel consisted of: 1) self\u00ad paced assessment of, respectively, HIV/STD exposure and transmission risk, and 2) feedback modules, in which an indi\u00ad vidual's responses to a risk scenario triggered presentations of the consequences of various choices and/or corrective infonna\u00ad tion [8]. Also, randomized clinical trials of automated tele\u00ad phone patient assistance systems have demonstrated clinical efficacy and reduction in emergency health services utilization by patients [9]-[14]. Evaluations by patients, consumers, and health professionals have indicated high levels of satisfaction with using IVR patient assistance programs such as the tele\u00ad phone-linked communications (1Le) discussed below. Basis for Discriminant Functions There is a long and distinguished history of the use of psycho\u00ad logical testing dating back to World Wmr Il, with more recent developments in intelligent medical diagnostic and triage algo\u00ad rithms. A number of assessment tools, both self-report ques\u00ad tionnaires and structured interviews, have been validated specifically for identifying and diagnosing a variety of more or less relevant psychological reactions and conditions (Table 1) [15], [16]. For example, \"Impact of Event Scale-Revised\" (IES-R), is a 22-item self-report measure designed to assess current subjective distress for any specific life event [17]-[19]. Recently, a National Institute for Mental Health (NIMH) roundtable compared the sensitivity and specificity of dozens of such instruments with unpublished results at this time [20]. IEEEENGINEERING INMEDICINE ANDBIOLOGY MAGAZINE JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2004 163 These currently available instruments are generally narrow in their scope of assessment and have not been designed to distin\u00ad guish psychiatric morbidity and psychosocial distress from acute physical illness. Stress and anxiety indicators, in and of themselves, are not expected to discriminate well between exposed and nonexposed populations. In the immediate after\u00ad math of mass casualty events and the resultant media exposure, many individuals-with varying levels of exposure to a CBRNE agent-experience nonspecific (and also specific health-related) stress-related symptoms, most of which will subside in the short term. It is also important to recognize that individual differences dominate event characteristics in the response to toxic events and treatment options [21]. Hence, new tools must be developed, which will largely be based on objective agent-specific symptoms [22]. Nonetheless, elements of various psychological assessments might prove useful in community crisis awareness tools to reflect the level of distress by the individual and assist in the differential diagnosis. Thus, automated crisis health risk self-assessment tools will primarily aim to discriminate between agent-derived illness and psychogenic phenomena through: 1) knowledge of the range of symptomatology generated by given biothreat agents over time, 2) our expanding knowledge and database of sociodemographic and psychosocial factors that characterize persons demonstrating MUPS [23]-[26], and 3) geospatial and temporal data of actual threat exposure information. Further sensitivity and specificity will be achieved by includ\u00ad ing questions to assess individual response proclivities, including nonattentive or social desirability answering, mini\u00ad mizing, exaggerating, and frank malingering. The result will be a probabilistic differentiation between those who are suf\u00ad fering from actual exposure and those without clear exposure TABLE 1.

With time and validation testing, such systems could become further sophisticated and capable, but even an imperfect system would be an enor\u00ad mous improvement to the current system, or lack thereof, in which no attempt is made to segregate the MUPS from exposed individuals. An ideal assessment tool would be tiered, sensitive to time and event processes, and inter\u00ad active. As an example of a tiered assessment, someone who self-reports symptoms of confu\u00adsion would move down the algorithm to a brief assessment of anxiety, which could exacerbate these symptoms. Ifsuch symptoms are not anxi\u00ad ety related, the person could be given a brief automated neurocognitive screening battery. Such tools could not only categorize symp\u00ad toms but also assess the severity and phase of anxiety or illness. Interactive discernment of levels of possible exposure would lead to vari\u00ad ous agent-specific algorithms in tiered sys\u00ad tems. This information would be useful for prioritization schema, as well as useful for spe\u00ad cific medical care or mental support. Thus, a severity scale or time plot wizard would assist emergency or mental healthcare workers to address patient needs optimally and efficiently, as well as to furnish a picture of overall com\u00ad munity health. Not only might this novel technology prove to be more efficient, but it might also improve the accuracy of discrimination and differential diagnosis. Emergency physicians are not gen\u00ad erally adept at dealing with psychogenic symp\u00ad tomatology [27], whereas the computer can deploy sophisticated heuristics and statistics to analyze the responses of a presenting individ\u00ad ual, and use dynamic real-time state-of-the-art information that has evolved during a particu\u00ad lar biological event. Current Efforts We now describe three complementary existing or developing tools that aid or could aid individ\u00ad uals in conducting self-assessments following a bioterrorist outbreak, 164 IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY MAGAZINE JANUARY IFEBRUARV 2004 Proposed National Capital Region Se\"-Risk Assessment and CommunicationDemo System This proposed self-risk assessment and communication sys\u00ad tem is based upon an initial assessment tool developed at the Harvard School of Public Health and the School of Medicine, by Rick Newell, Steven Locke, Paul Testa, and Kathy Wong. The plan is to launch the system on Global Health Initiatives servers as a testbed within the National Capital Region during 2004 [28]. The function of this tool is to intervene as a triage mechanism in the period following a likely biological weapon attack. Secondarily, it assists with the separation of those who are manifesting symptoms from actual exposure to the agent from those who are experiencing the symptoms as a result of attack-related stressors. Risk communication skills are used throughout the system to appropriately convey the relative risk of exposure. An incorporated geographic information system (GIS) allows the tool to assist with public health out\u00ad break investigations, case finding, and directions customiz\u00ad able to the individual taking the assessment. The tool can be deployed via paper, phone with speech-recognition software, home computer via the Internet, a screening center, or an acute care facility. The assessment begins with the questions most predictive of actual exposure. If the respondent answers these questions in such a way that indicates he or she should seek medical care, the program will so direct the individual, and the assessment will end. This tool assesses four types of data. Type 1 data assesses the patient demographics and situational factors such as proximity to exposure and availability of mass transporta\u00ad tion. Type 2 data are customized to a given attack/agent, based upon knowledge of the presumptive agent from syn\u00ad dromic surveillance, intelligence, or detection systems. Type 3 data assess symptoms that are more likely the result of acute stress rather than exposure. Type 4 data assess the sus\u00adceptibility of the individual to experience physical symptoms as a result of stress. A [mal score is given to each patient and reflects the probability that he or she is experiencing symp\u00ad toms related to exposure versus the acute stress of the attack. A threshold score will be set at which the respondent will be directed to seek medical care in order to be treated for expo\u00ad sure or further rule out exposure. Other thresholds can be set directing respondents to other sources of care or counseling. These thresholds will be adjusted during the time following an attack based on the capacity and flow through emergency and healthcare services. The threshold can be lowered con\u00ad tinuously as healthcare services are able to deal with added patients, and thus all respondents can be seen eventually if they so desire. By delaying or smoothing out the somatiza\u00adtion surge post event, medical access of those more likely at risk is protected and ensured. Pediatric DisasterSystemsofCare and PsySTART PsySTART is a pediatric disaster system of care model linked to a technology-basedrapid triage system [29], [30].Developed by Merritt Schreiber at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, the systemis designedfor comprehensiveincidentman\u00ad agement of pediatric mental health risk across phases of mass casualty events and across various \"disaster systems of care.\" The system usesaWeb-basedinterfaceto systematicallytriage, assess, and track children at risk from psychological conse\u00ad quences of mass casualty events, disasters, and weapons of (WMD) terrorismevents.PsySTARTprovides real-time, GIS-enabled linkage between emergency specialized medical dis\u00ad aster settings (i.e., NDMS IDMAT), disaster relief agencies, and publicmentalhealthto linkservicesforchildrenat highriskfor post-event effects. It serves as a centralized communication tool to coordinate the acute phase and recovery mental health responseand establishesa common protocolfor seamlesstriage, screening,clinicalassessment,and definitivecare. Automated Telephone-Based Symptom Triage TLC is a telecommunications system for monitoring patient symptoms and other clinical findings and for educating, advis\u00ad ing, and counseling patients and consumers about their health and medical conditions. TLC technology and clinical applica\u00ad tions have been developed and evaluated by Robert Friedman and colleagues at Boston University with about $20M of sup\u00ad port from the National Institutes of Health and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality over the past 20 years. TLC systems use validated instruments supplemented by expert clinician input to evaluate potential symptoms and to report these automatically to responsible clinicians in a form that assists in clinical decision making [31]-[34]. For a future biodefense preparedness system, TLC could be used, via a toll-free telephone number, for people who believe they may have been affected in an event to triage them for appropriate follow-up. Using behavior change intervention strategies that have been effective in a variety of health behaviors, TLC could also educate, advise, and counsel individuals who are likely to have stress-related symptoms. System Architecture Automated health risk self-assessment tools should be incorpo\u00adrated into IT system software that is sufficiently general so it can be applied to jurisdictions throughout the United States, and yet is sufficiently flexible to be customizable for local .needs. Ultimately, any IT solution to bioterrorist incidents should be a distributed system, based upon core standardized and interoperable tools that allow custornization and localiza\u00ad tion at the state and local levels. Any IT software must be flexi\u00ad ble to accommodate to new, dynamic, and fluctuating situations, as well as to adapt to a variety of jurisdictional polit\u00ad ical requirements and information system architectures. Open\u00ad system software should be used to permit the greatest flexibility for adaptation.The system must have a central archi\u00ad tecture with the core elements of the system, as well as local controllables, supplementaldatabases, and customized applica\u00ad tions that can be added over time. The system should be redun\u00ad dant so that it is not dependent upon only one communication mode; for instance, it would not be wise to assume the Internet will be available for the system to function during a crisis. Acceptance and integration into the IT fabric of modem governments will require consideration of pertinent standards. The broader biodefense and homeland security information infrastructure to which these system components may be linked will also play key roles in assisting outbreak responses. The system may integrate multiple functional components (e.g., self-assessment, resource tracking, referral, risk commu\u00ad nication, surveillance, alerts, geographic tracking) into a seam\u00ad less decision support system. Thus, a broad variety of applications-such as computer-assisted screening interviews, meme [35] surveillance of portal databases to trigger alerts on psychological and behavioral issues, chemical and biological \". IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY MAGAZINE JANUARY IFEBRUARY 2004 165 magnitude>targer;th'GIFt\u00a5fhevna lvr ,. seeking care whoareactually exposed or ill. detection devices, monitoring contact distance through the use of locator bracelets, tracking of patients, allocation of resource stockpiles, management of patient flow, and tracking of behavioral response to risk communications-can and should be developed and linked to the self-risk assessment and com\u00ad munication IT system. (A \"meme\" is an idea that is passed on from one human generation to another. It is the cultural equiv\u00ad alent of a gene, the basic element of biological inheritance. The term was coined in 1976 by Richard Dawkins in his book, The Selfish Gene. Dawkins speculated that human beings have an adaptive mechanism that other species don't have. In addi\u00ad tion to genetic inheritance, with its possibilities and limita\u00ad tions, humans, said Dawkins, can pass their ideas from one generation to the next, allowing them to surmount challenges more flexibly and more quickly than through the longer process of genetic adaptation and selection.) In this way, mul\u00ad tifunctional homeland security system components can inter\u00ad connect and work synergistically to provide a seamless fabric that best protects our citizens and societal infrastructure. We propose that the system infrastructure conform to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Federal Enterprise Architecture (PEA) Technical Reference Model Version 1.0 [36] and be informed by Department of Defense biosurveil\u00ad lance data integration efforts. In addition, the software should be compatible with the developing National Health Information Infrastructure [37] following the specific guid\u00ad ance for IT systems [38] and risk communication [39] estab\u00ad lished by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It is anticipated that the architecture may rely heavily on messaging infrastructures (i.e., message queuing) and con\u00ad tent (XML, fll..7, etc.) while allowing for fully autonomous local functioning and capturing clinical data using the expect\u00ad ed standards (e.g., LOINC, SNOMED, and DICOM. Security and privacy concerns will be of utmost importance to any such system that deals with sensitive individual infor\u00ad mation and public surveillance data. Universal secure access to the system is necessary, however, for participation of gov\u00ad ernment leaders, responders, and the public. Other System Functions In addition to the primary purpose of health risk self-assess\u00ad ment screening and reduction of surge, there are other signifi\u00ad cant potential functions of this proposed system: I) medical staging and prioritization, 2) contact distance management, 3) surveillance of community mental health and psychosocial! behavioral concerns, and 4) risk communication. Medical Staging and Prioritization In addition to discriminating psychogenic manifestations from bioagent-derived symptoms, the system could also provide information on the level of emotional distress, a likely phase 166 IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY MAGAZINE of the malady that would be useful for later emergency care\u00ad givers to have at their fingertips. Self-assessment tools could provide a tiered structure of screenings according to construct\u00ad ed algorithms that would order clinical diagnostic tests auto\u00ad matically on the basis of respondents' answers. Contact Distance Management The crisis self-assessment tools may provide the epidemiolog\u00ad ical data necessary for public health interventions to prevent contact with an infectious agent and to maintain social dis\u00ad tance between exposed and nonexposed groups. In the case of communicable infectious disease, the benefit is clear and com\u00ad pelling. In addition, it is also good medical practice to separate those with actual disease from those with stress disorders and other psychopathologies to prevent further psychogenic (\"hys\u00ad terical\") contagion. An automated crisis health risk self\u00ad assessment system could play a major role in increasing the efficiency of patient isolation and self-quarantine in the case of community spread of an infectious agent such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Risk Communication The proposed automated crisis health risk self-assessment sys\u00ad tem can be used as a vehicle to facilitate communications to the general public. The quality of the communication about an outbreak and corresponding messages of civic leaders and government officials can foster fear or allay anxiety, and thus the resultant levels of stress, distress, and MUPS [40], [41]. For example, Winston Churchill through his oratory effective\u00ad ly calmed the British people in the face of great danger. The ability to identify, categorize, prioritize, and communicate risks is critical to optimize response in disasters [42]. The proposed system could be a significant component of a wider community risk communication effort. The commu\u00ad nicators used in automated crisis health risk self-assessment communication components should be known and trusted figures within a given community (e.g., video sequencing showing a respected person advising you to stay calm or helping you consider whether you have symptoms pertinent to the current emergency). The IT system could educate and inform specific targeted communities by providing linkages to other local sources of information. It would help augment understanding of basic biological concepts such as relative risk, exposure, contagion, and so forth, so that individuals may make better and more empowered decisions regarding their health in crises. The interactive nature of this technolo\u00ad gy could be extended into providing mini-interventions for various problems (e.g., lack of information or understanding about a biological agent) and individually tailored on-the\u00ad spot corrections of misinformation, reducing uncertainty, and decreasing anxiety. JANUARY {FEBRUARY 2004 Automated components of these systems will enable auto\u00ad matic translation of messages into other languages and use culturally competent and educationally appropriate vocabulary and phraseology. IT permits highly interactive and customiz\u00ad able communications that enable appropriate responses to an individual's and subpopulation's reactions in helping make health- and life-critical decisions and take actions in high-risk, and potentially low-trust, environments. A person could indi\u00ad cate in the beginning of the assessment whether s/he would like to have the \"interviewer's\" or communicator's voice in a certain language or gender, and the system could recognize the source location and customize accordingly. Groups that might receive specifically tailored messages include those immedi\u00ad ately threatened by the incident, healthcare workers, rural dwellers, families, and those with special needs. Such a sys\u00ad tem could deliver evidence-based messages that are soothing as well as action oriented, precisely to those most concerned. To address the individual's need for self-preserving actions in a context of understanding issues affecting the common good, programs can be designed to deliver messages designed to maintain and improve community cohesion and resilience in times of emergency and crisis. Surveillance of Community Mental Health Simultaneously, while the system assists preliminary screen\u00ad ing functions, data can be generated on the evolving public reaction to a critical incident. Key professional, community, and government decision makers will be able to monitor surge capacity, public response, and message structure in a secure back-end component of the system that includes sci\u00ad entific visualization and decision support employing a GIS. Information on the number of patients directed to mental health workers, emergency medical care, and other support systems will facilitate ideal healthcare resource allocation. Moreover, the data will be a real-time direct gauge of the true incidence and magnitude of public concern and psy\u00ad chosocial dimensions, along with geospatial and temporal aspects used to determine trending. Viewing this information dynamically on GISs enables key decision makers to respond effectively to the most pressing considerations of the crisis at that specific moment. Specifically, the system could permit a more formalized community-wide risk assessment to public health and emergency services. The need for such a system was highlighted during the 2002 anthrax letter attacks, when the CDC received over 11,000 telephone calls from the pub\u00ad lic. The absence of standardized health communication pro\u00ad tocols prevented efficient follow-up investigations and could not give an up-to-the-minute sophisticated picture of the public reaction [43]. Implementation stakeholders Automated health risk self-assessment software components are likely to be developed by a broad array of public and pri\u00ad vate interests. A range of licensing and ownership options are likely to emerge if automated health risk self-assessment toolk\u00ad its and systems are determined by pure market forces. System service stakeholdersmight includestates, politicaljurisdictions, public health departments, mental health services, emergency services, nongovernmental organizations (e.g., the American Red Cross), regional and local hospitals and healthcare sys- IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY MAGAZINE tems, as well as the patients themselves. It is suggested that core system components be developed according to national standards, evaluated by the Federal government, but main\u00ad tained by private interests required to meet established perfor\u00admance and safety standards. Incentives, such as from an advanced component economy, should be created to ensure that automated health risk self-assessment tools, components, and systems continue to evolve in depth, breadth, and quality. Attempts should be made to benchmark the most effective self\u00ad assessment tools, components, and systems. Emergency services have command and control authority over crisis incidents and thus they are a possible service owner, particularly if the system is aimed at prehospital distri\u00ad bution. The data generation and risk communications aspects of such a system would seem clearly to fit within governmen\u00ad tal crisis response efforts. Medical triage, however, is an important entry function of healthcare systems, and automat\u00ad ed health risk self-assessment tools could playa part in direct\u00ad ing individuals toward appropriate hospital admitting operations. Healthcare systems will want control over patients once they are entered into their system. A psychosocial or mental health triage tool may be claimed as the province of human resource departments. Perhaps the most obvious owner/licensee would be public health departments, in that community health and the medical consequences of a bioter\u00ad rorist outbreak are usually the province of public health authorities. It is conceivable, however, that public health sys\u00ad tems may not see such an IT solution as among their tradi\u00adtional duties and responsibilities. We would argue that the need to prevent the overload of medical services of a region-which could lead to a failure of system response-is logically construed as a local or regional public health responsibility that transcends any single healthcare system. Regardless of the agency that takes ownership of the sys\u00ad tem, it would be helpful for the effort to be communicated to and reviewed by as many stakeholders as possible, including the medical community, public health, emergency responders, and members of the community whose suggestions would improve acceptability and feasibility of implementation. Challenges for obtaining cooperation will include funding, \"turf,\" and the difficulty in validating the early instantiations of the systems. Uability Liabilities are created both from errors of commission and errors of omission. Some may voice concerns over the liability involved in self-assessment tools. This same concern was voiced in earlier years with respect to medical Web sites and self-help books, which have now been in common usage for many years without significant problems regarding litigation. Nonetheless, national standards establishing the scientific basis and validation and verification process for such systems will be important to maximize public safety and minimize lia\u00ad bility for the product developers and service owners/licensees who comply with the national standards. The preliminary assessment, screening, referral, and risk communication components should carry disclaimers that the system is for educational purposes and is not to be considered diagnostic (which would, under the present conditions, require the direct intervention of a physician in real time). However, in lieu of full diagnosis, there is reason to believe from the exten\u00ad sive literature on premedical screening that the assessment and JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2004 167 referral components can handle large numbers of people in a premedical screening mode that directs those with high risks of exposure or medical symptoms to appropriate medical and mental health servicesfor further diagnosisand treatment. Upon completion of the screening, the symptomatic patient will end up in the care of a traditional human service-based medical or mental health professional. If the individual has been found to be misdirected, he or she can be then be redi\u00ad rected to the more appropriate medical element. The greatest concern is that individuals who are at high risk might use health risk self-assessment tools and not seek necessary care. This potential problem needs to be carefully studied in con\u00ad trolled environments-perhaps in nonemergency conditions, such as during the annual flu season-to explore the extent of this potential problem. Every effort should be made to avoid false negative risk designations while also understanding the critical need to reduce infrastructure overload by MUPS patients and lower-risk, asymptomatic individuals. Without such a premedical screening system and with med\u00ad ical systems under the stress of infrastructure overload, many people in need of immediate medical care may be delayed in reaching medical care or may not reach a medical professional during the critical time necessary to optimize treatment and reduce harm to others. Before community crisis assessment systems come into common usage, the perceived liability will be in the adoption of such systems. Once systems are in com\u00ad mon practice, by far the greater liability will be in not provid\u00ad ing access to health risk self-assessment tools. Pilot Projects Pilot testing will be necessary for validation and verification efforts to gamer acceptance and to make improvements in the self-assessment tools and IT system. With pilot tests, many problems, gaps, and potential solutions will be revealed. Although the system's objectives are compelling, early test\u00ad beds must be carefully evaluated and well documented in attaining their proposed goals before many jurisdictions will adopt the operational systems. Validation will, in the first instance, begin with clinical practice and perhaps also during emergency preparedness training exercises. Simulated attacks have been used to assess community reactions. For example, DiGiovanni and colleagues simulated an intentional Rift Valley fever outbreak in a community in the southern part of the United States using a series of simulated print and televi\u00ad sion \"news reports\" over a fictional nine-day crisis period [44]. Demonstrations through early adopters will be necessary. Potential testbeds might include: 1) the National Capital Region; 2) Allegheny County, Pennsylvania; 3) Santa Clara County, California; 4) Los Angeles County, California; and 5) the state of Massachusetts, with a focus on the Boston metro\u00ad politan area. In each area, there is a very active bioterrorism preparedness effort, perceived vulnerabilities to infrastructure overload, and a willingness to investigate new IT solutions. Funding DHS may also be a significant source of funding for prehospi\u00ad tal systems to states and localities. CDC and the Health Resources and Services Administration funds may also be useful in distributing toolsets as regional patient surge capaci\u00ad tylbioterrorism equipment. The need for such systems would seem to be a national mandate, in the wake of 911 and the anthrax outbreak of fall 2001. The cost of effective risk 168 IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY MAGAZINE assessment tools and communication systems amortized over many jurisdictions would be a small fraction of the human service costs associated with addressing the service need directly through the health care system, let alone the human costs and economic damage associated with a healthcare sys\u00ad tem failure during a crisis. Thus, the need to proliferate and distribute effective automated health risk self-assessment sys\u00ad tems broadly should follow quickly. Conclusion To date, biological weapons have proven to be more of a psy\u00ad chological threat than a physical danger, and while they may someday result in significant mortality they would seem always to create larger numbers of psychological illness. At least in the United States, they have proven to be weapons not of mass destruction but of mass psychogenic illness. Hippocrates first noted this phenomenon around 400 BC when he introduced the term hysteria to describe a group of women he observed who had unexplained muscle spasms, abdominal cramps, nausea, and headaches [45]. This phenom\u00ad enon has been recognized as the presentation of physical symptoms for which there is no underlying physical cause but instead appear to be manifestations of psychological distress. Healthy adults commonly experience isolated minor symp\u00ad toms, minor illness, and transient dysfunctions in the course of daily life that could be construed as within the range of hyster\u00ad ical phenomena. Population-based surveys indicate that 86% to 95% of the general population experience at least one symptom in a given two-to four-week interval, and the typical adult has at least one somatic symptom every four to six days [46]-[50]. After a bioterrorist attack, individuals experiencing these psychogenic symptoms will outnumber those actually exposed by many times. These two patient groups must be separated and addressed differently; yet, there is currently no established, validated tool or mechanism to manage this real\u00ad istic challenge. By using the power of information technology, self-assessment tools will be able to distinguish these two groups; provide initial customized feedback to individuals about their risk, what they can do to manage stress and psy\u00ad chogenic symptoms, and/or seek medical care for likely agent or event-based physical symptoms; provide a mechanism to screen, prioritize and distribute the patient surge; optimize resource allocation; facilitate individual and community risk communications; and surveil and monitor public exposure, stress, and reactions to crisis events.

Introduction Developing effective suicide prevention remains a formidablechallenge.Approximately30,000Americansarelost to suicide each year. Suicide is the third leading causeof death in individuals ages 15-24 ( Centers for Disease ControlandPrevention,2004 )andthe11thleadingcauseof death overall.

Wines Jr. et al. / Drug and Alcohol Dependence 76S (2004) S21-S29 a signicant percentage of suicides and suicide attempts are alcohol or drug-related ( Mendelson and Rich, 1993; with substance-related disorders are atincreased risk for suicidal behavior, a vague knowledge oftheclinicalnatureofthedrug-suicidalbehaviorlinkhampersboth risk-identication et al., 2003; Roy,2002; Roy, 2001 ). A retrospective study of patients present- ingforaninitialpsychiatricevaluation,foundthatalcoholicswith major Corneliusetal.,1998 primary diagnosisof non-psychotic, unipolar depression, concluded that highlevels of current alcohol/drug use were associated with in-creased suicidal ideation ( Pages et al., 1997 ). Despite advances, there are still substantial gaps in our current understanding of drug-related suicidal behavior. Al-though the risk of suicidal behavior associated with alco-hol intoxication has been supported by numerous studies(Borges sui-cidalbehavior( Recently, retrospective studies have begun to describe char-acteristics of suicidal behavior by individuals dependent ondifferent types of drugs (e.g., cocaine dependence, opioiddependence) ( Darke et al., 2004; Garlow et al., 2003; Roy, 2002; Roy, 2001 ). Thus, it is not surprising that prospective studies examining the relationship between changes in druguse, depressive symptoms and suicidal behavior are scant. Thepurposeofthisprospectivecohortstudywastomore clearly dene the phenomenology of drug-related suicidalbehaviorbyidentifyingfactorsassociatedwithnon-fatalsui-cidal behavior (suicidal ideation and suicide attempt) in asampleofpatientsinitiallyadmittedfordetoxication.Threehypotheses were tested: (1) differences in suicidal behaviorwillexistacrossdrugcategories;(2)pastsuicideattemptwillbeassociatedwithsuicideattemptduringfollow-up;and(3)moredepressivesymptomsand/ormorefrequentdruguseatfollow-upwillbesignicantlyandindependentlyassociatedwith suicidal behavior. 2.

Subject eligibility cri-teria were the following: (1) admitted for inpatient detoxi-cation; (2) identied alcohol, cocaine, or heroin as rst orseconddrugofchoice;(3)didnothaveaprimarycarephysi-cian; (4) over 17 years old; (5) not pregnant; (6) fluent inEnglish or Spanish; (7) lived in the Boston Medical Centercatchment area (Boston metropolitan area, primarily innercity) or were homeless; (8) not planning to leave the Bostonareawithinthenext12months;(9)abletoprovidethreecon-tactnamestoassistwithfollow-uptracking;and(10)scored>20onthemini-mentalstateexam( Folsteinetal.,1975 ).Su- permarket certicates, US$ 20 for the initial evaluation andUS$ 30 per follow-up interview, were used to compensateparticipants for their time. 2.3. Assessments and measures Trained research associates administered standard inter- viewstosubjectsatstudyentry(i.e.,theindexadmissionfordetoxication)andduringfollow-upinterviewsattheBostonUniversity General Clinical Research Center or via tele-phone.Duringdetoxication,subjectswereinterviewedonlyafter the resolution of acute withdrawal symptoms. For theSpanish interview standardized scales in Spanish were usedwhenavailable;theremainderofthequestionnairewastrans-latedfromEnglishintoSpanish,back-translatedtocheckforaccuracy, and then corrected. Assessments pertinent to thecurrent investigation included: demographics (age, gender,and race/ethnicity); homeless status; history of any sexualand/or physical abuse; Severity Index (ASI) al-cohol and drug sub-scales ( McLellan et ( Radloff, 1977 ); phys- ical health status as measured by the Short Form HealthSurvey, physical component summary (SF-36-PCS) ( Ware, 1993);andindicatorsofsocialsupportfromfriendsandfam- ily assessed by the Perceived Social Support Scale (PSS)J.D. Wines Jr. et al. / Drug and Alcohol Dependence 76S (2004) S21-S29 S23 (ProcidanoandHeller,1983 ).Homelessness,adichotomous variable,wasdenedashavinglivedinahomelessshelteroronthestreetfor1ormoredaysduringtheprevious6months. 2.3.1. Problem Drug categories at detoxication admission Problem Drug categories were constructed from the 11 drugs(alcohol,heroin,methadone,otheropioids/analgesics,barbiturates, sedatives/hypnotics/tranquilizers, cocaine, am-phetamine, cannabis, hallucinogens, and inhalants) listed inthe at the index admission for detoxication. In the ab-sence of formal drug diagnoses (abuse or dependence), fre-quency of drug use was used as a marker for excessive orheavy use. Problem Drug for a particular substance was de- ned as use 3 times per week (for alcohol \"use\" means to intoxication or 3 drinks) for a year or more, or 5 or more days of use in the past 30 days (denitions based onthe ASI and outcome denitions used in treatment studies)(McLellan et al., 1992; O'Malley et al., 1992; Volpicelli et al., 1992). Theoretical considerations were used to combine drugswithsimilarpharmacologicpropertiesforanalysis,cre-atingfour ProblemDrug categories:alcohol;opioids(heroin, methadoneandotheropioids/analgesics);sedatives(barbitu-rates and sedatives/hypnotics/tranquilizers); and stimulants(cocaine and amphetamines). Indicator variables for eachProblem Drug category were produced by combining the relevant drugs listed in the ASI. For example, if a subjectmet theProblem Drug denition for any of the three opioid drugs(heroin,methadoneandotheropioids/analgesics),thenthe subject would be considered to have problem opioid use(OpioidProblem Drug ), an indicator of frequent use and a proxyforopioidabuse/dependence.Also,acontinuousvari-able representing the total number of the eleven drugs listedon the ASI that met the Problem Drug criteria was created. 2.3.2. Drug Use after detoxication (follow-up) Drug Use was dened as the number of days used in the past 30 days as recorded by the ASI (range, 0-30 days) dur-ing follow-up. For Problem Drug categories consisting of more than one drug (i.e., opioids, sedatives, stimulants), thesingle most commonly used drug by the cohort at study en-try(i.e.,heroin,benzodiazepines,cocaine)wasutilized.This'one drug per category' approach was taken in part to mini-mizeambiguityregardingthenumberofdaysused,asitcan-notbedeterminedfromtheASIwhetherdrugsusedwithinacategory are used on the same day or on different days.

In addition, a continuous variablerepresenting the total number of the eleven drugs listed on the ASI with any use in the past 30 days was created as amarker for polydrug use. 2.4. Primary outcomes Theprimaryoutcomesforthisstudyweresuicidalideation andsuicidalattempt.Suicidalbehavior(ideationandattempt)was assessed by two questions from the Addiction SeverityIndex (ASI): \"Have you attempted suicide?

Because different risk factors have beenreported for suicidal ideation and suicide attempt, separatestatistical analyses were performed for each of these out-comes. Variable selection was based on previous scientic stud- ies and clinical experience. To test the rst hypothesis weuseddatacollectedatstudyentryonly.Modelsforthecross-sectional logistic regression analysis included the variablesage, gender, race, homeless status, SF-36-physical compo-nentsummary(PCS),perceivedsocialsupport(Family),per-ceivedsocialsupport(Friends),historyofphysicalorsexualabuse, depressive symptoms (CES-D), and Problem Drug category. Secondary analyses were conducted entering onlyoneProblem Drug category per model rather than all four simultaneously. Similarly, a single continuous variable rep-resentingthetotalnumberofdrugslistedontheASIfulllingtheProblem Drug criteria was also tested in the models. Data from follow-up were used to test the second and thirdhypotheses.Intheinterestofparsimonyandbecauseofa small number of outcomes, only variables that were sig-nicantly associated with suicidal behavior from the cross-sectional logistic regression models or considered clinicallyessential were entered into the longitudinal models.

Discussion Suicidal behavior is a common dimension of life for pa- tientsrequiringdetoxication.Suchlifethreateningthoughtsand actions merit study so as to enable recognition of an in-dividual's suicidal risk and facilitate appropriate action tominimizeconsequences.Themajorndingsofthisstudyarefourfold: (1) differences for lifetime suicidal behavior ex-ist between drug categories; (2) prior suicidal behavior is animportant risk factor for future suicidal behavior; (3) moredepressivesymptomsatfollow-upareassociatedwithsuici-dal behavior; and (4) more frequent use of benzodiazepinesand alcohol is associated with follow-up suicidal ideationwhendepressivesymptomsarenotcontrolledforinamulti-variablemodel.Thisstudyuniquelyaddstotheliteraturean examination of suicidal behavior in a prospective study of alarge,ethnicallydiversecohortdischargedfromadetoxica-tion unit and demonstrates that more depressive symptomsandmorefrequentdruguse(benzodiazepinesandalcohol)atfollow-up are associated with suicidal ideation. Like earlier reports, suicidal behavior is common among patients admitted with drug-related disorders ( Pages et al., 1997;Roy,2002;Roy,2001 ).One-fthofpatientsacknowl- follow-up. The incidence of ideation and at-tempt in those with no past suicidal behavior was 8.4% and2.3%, respectively\u2014rates lower than the 20.6% for \"newsuicidal 5.5% for new onset suicide attempt re-portedfroma2.5yearfollow-upofopioid-dependentpatients(KostenandRounsaville,1988 ).Thesediscrepanciesmaybe explained in part by differences in the sample populations(opioidsversusavarietyofsubstancesused)andoperationaldenitions of suicidal behavior. In our sample, a history of suicidal ideation and attempt were strong predictors of future ideation and attempt, re-spectively.Arecent5-yearfollow-upof1237alcoholicsalsodemonstrated that previous suicide attempt was strongly as-sociatedwithfutureattempts( Preussetal.,2003 ).Therepli- cationofthisresultinaprospectivesampleofsubjectsusinga variety of drugs has signicant 1997). Our data suggest CNS depressants like benzodiazepines, barbiturates and alcohol elevate the risk for suicidal behav-ior.Severalpotentialmechanismsforalcoholtriggeringsui-cidalbehaviorhavebeensuggestedincludingalcohol'sabil-ity to disinhibit behavior, increase depression, facilitate ag-gression, and narrow attention ( and Schuckit, 1988; ). Other CNS depressants may work through similarmechanisms,althoughempiricaldataarelacking.Thesmallnumberofstudiesthathaveinvestigatedwhetherdiffer-J.D. Wines Jr. et al. / Drug and Alcohol Dependence 76S (2004) S21-S29 S27 encesinthe\"suicidepotential\"existbetweendrugcategories yielded contradictory ndings. In of 155 \"polydrugabusers,\" WardandSchuckit(1980) reportedthatsubjectsus- ing primarily sedative/hypnotic drugs had more serious sectional study of 2051 patients with drug-related signicantly more likely than daily users of stimulantor opioid drugs to attempt suicide (Rossow and Lauritzen,1999). In contrast, Borges et al., 2000 analyzing data from the National Comorbidity Survey, reported similar risk forsuicide attempt across most drug types, concluding that thenumberofdifferentdrugsusedwasmoreimportantthanthetypeofdrugused( Borgesetal.,2000 ).Thenumberofdrugs in our study was signicantly associated with lifetime suici-dal behavior and suicidal ideation after detoxication. Thedifferences in these results from the National ComorbiditySurvey may be due to methodology (i.e., community versustreatment study populations). Data obtained from our subjects after discharge from the detoxication unit reveal an interesting, yet complex, rela-tionship between depressive symptoms, drug use and suici-dal behavior. In addition to drug use, depressive symptomscan result from a variety of sources including mood disor-der, adjustment disorder, bereavement, and medical illness(DSM-IV,1994;RaimoandSchuckit,1998 ).Thiscouldpar- tiallyexplaintherobustassociationofdepressivesymptomsatfollow-upwithbothsuicidalideationandsuicideattempt,regardless of controlling for drug use in the multivariablemodel. For drug use, no association was found with follow-upsuicideattempt,whetherornotdepressivesymptomswereinthemultivariablemodel.However,morefrequentdruguse(alcohol and benzodiazepines) was associated with follow-up suicidal ideation when the model did not include depres-sivesymptoms,suggestingcollinearitybetweendruguseanddepressive symptoms. It is plausible that drug use and de-pressivesymptomsmediateeachother\u2014e.g.,increasingsub-stanceusecausesincreaseddepressivesymptoms(substance-induced depression) ( Brown and Schuckit, 1988; Ries et al., 2001). Alternatively, increasing depressive symptoms may lead directly to increasing substance use (self-medication)(Khantzian, 1985 )(Fig. 1). Drug use and depressive symp- toms may lie on the same mechanistic pathway for suicidalideation, a hypothesis that is consistent with the data, how-ever, the directionality of this relationship cannot be deter-mined with the current study design. Ourndingsareconsistentwitharecentprospectivestudy analyzing data from Project MATCH which found that bothdrinkinganddepressivesymptomswereassociatedwithsui-cidal ideation in alcoholics ( Conner et al., 2003 ), although direct comparison with our study is limited partly by thesmallersamplesizewhichprecludesstraticationbygenderand analysis of different drinking patterns. Future researchshould focus on the precise sequence of events for drug useanddepressivesymptomsaswellasstudyingtheassociationbetween suicidal behaviors and more sensitive measures of Fig.1. Modelsoftherelationshipbetweendruguse,depressivesymptoms, and suicidal behavior. frequency (e.g., number of times per day used) and quantity (e.g., grams of cocaine, bags of heroin, amount of moneyspent) of Drug Use that have the potential to reveal distinct use patterns as well as more accurate estimates of dose. Age,femalegender,andhistoryofsexualabusearewell- established risk factors for suicidal behavior ( Borges et al., 2000;Moscicki,1997;Roy,2001,2002 ).Inourdata,younger age, female gender and history of sexual abuse were associ-atedwithlifetimesuicidalbehavior,butnotsuicidalbehavioratfollow-uppossiblyduetoinsufcientpower.TheincreasedriskforsuicidalbehaviorbyHispanicshasbeenreportedbysome investigators but not by others ( Canino and Roberts, al., 2001; TortoleroandRoberts,2001 ).Clearly,thispotentialethnicdisparityin suicidal behavior merits further investigation. This study has some important limitations. Although widelyacceptedandvalidatedinstrumentswereused,theyas-sessdifferenttimeperiods(i.e.,depressivesymptoms(CES-D):oneweek;druguse(ASI):1month).Therefore,wecan-not draw rm conclusions regarding the temporal relation-ship between depressive symptoms, drug use and suicidalbehavior. As the study was not powered to detect multivari-ableassociationsforsuicidalbehavior,therelativelylowbaserateforsuicidalbehaviorafterstudyentry,especiallysuicideattempts,mayhaveresultedinTypeIIerrors.Diagnosticin-struments (e.g., SCID) were not used to obtain DSM-IV de-ned substance abuse, substance dependence, or depressionmaking comparisons with diagnosed populations more dif-cult. However, the stringent admission criteria for limitedpublic residential detoxication beds as well as the severityof results from other addiction measures in the study (e.g.,ASIscores)stronglysuggestthatallsubjectsmetcriteriaforsubstance dependence. Because our study recruited subjectsfromanunlockeddetoxicationunit,acutelysuicidalpatientsinneedofdetoxicationweremostlikelyadmittedtoamoresecure facility (i.e., a locked unit). Thus our results proba-blyunderestimatetheextentofsuicidalityinthispopulation.Finally,resultsfromthisinvestigationmaynotgeneralizetodissimilarpopulations(e.g.,patientswhosedrugofchoiceisS28 J.D. Wines Jr. et al. / Drug and Alcohol Dependence 76S (2004) S21-S29 not alcohol, heroin or cocaine; individuals not in treatment; adolescents). Therealsoareseveralstrengthsofthestudy:theprospec- tive study design; the diverse cohort, both ethnically and intermsofdrugpreferences;administrationofstandardizedin-struments by trained research associates; and application ofsurvivalmethodsthataccountforcensoringandtime-varyingcovariates. In summary, this study highlights the importance of sui- cidalbehaviorina\"captive\"population,residentialdetoxi-cationpatients,onethatmaybenetfromitsrecognitionandtreatment. Recently, Darke et al. (2004) recommended that individuals with heroin dependence receive routine screen-ing for suicidal behavior and depression. The presence ofsuch substantial disease prevalence and incidence as well asthe potential for targeted intervention, gives urgency to theconsideration of recurrent universal 'suicide-risk' screening of all patients with substance-related disorders. The feasi-bility and benet of such a policy for regular monitoring ofsuicidal behavior requires attention. The focus on a detoxi-cation population as a contact with the health care systemthat could be utilized to address suicide risk is pragmatic.Our ndings also suggest potential clinical utility of routineintervaltestingwithstandardizedinstrumentsfordepressivesymptoms (e.g., CES-D), drug use (e.g., ASI) and suicidalbehavior. Despite similarities between risk factors for suici-dalideationandsuicideattempt,itisimportanttoemphasizethat their relation to completed suicide is uncertain. Addi-tional studies are necessary to further characterize the nat-ural history of drug-related suicidal behavior and shed lightonthecomplexinterplayofthedrug-individual-environmenttriad. Understanding these relationships is crucial for devel-oping drug-sensitive, suicide risk-assessment instruments,innovative intervention strategies and enhanced suicideprevention.
