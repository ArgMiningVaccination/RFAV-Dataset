The workplace constitutes a main source of stress in western countries. The related ph ysiological and mental health impairments are manifold and well - documented, and the associated costs for individuals and society are considerable. Promising evidence suggests physical activity (PA) and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) may be public health resources that buffer the negative effects of stress on health. However, evidence from laboratory studies is conflicting to some extent, and research to elaborate previous findings in externally valid conditions is required. To date, research has primarly b een based on retrospective self -reports, and studies in realistic circumstances are scarce. This project was designed to examine the stress -buffering effects of PA and CRF on physiological and psychological health in realistic circumstances with a comprehe nsive methodology. A central goal of the current study was to investigate underlying mechanisms in line with the cross -stressor adaptation hypothesis (CSA) on psychophysiological stress responses. Dynamic psychophysiological processes were captured using n ewest methodological developments of Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) and Ambulatory Assessment (AA), as well as sophisticated statistical models. Research objectives : In a one -year prospective study with a sample of 201 police officers, exposure to chronic and acute work stress was examined, along with cardiometabolic and mental health parameters. PA was assessed over seven consecutive days via accelerometry, substantiated by a recently developed and validated questionnaire (Simple Physical Activity Q uestionnaire; SIMPAQ). CRF was objectively measured with the submaximal \u00c5strand cycling test. Chronic work stress was observed based on the job -demand and control (JDC) model, as well as the effort -reward imbalance (ERI) model. Acute work stress was measur ed using smartphone -based EMA of current stress experiences, whereas physiological responses were captured using AA of heart rate variability (HRV). Cardiovascular risk factors (waist circumference, blood pressure, blood sugar, blood lipids) were assessed in a laboratory setting and psychological health outcomes (Burnout, sleep health, psychological distress) via online -questionnaire. The first hypothesis posited moderating effects of PA and CRF on the association between chronic work stress, cardiometaboli c health, and mental health. Higher levels of PA and CRF were suggested to be related to improved cardiometabolic and mental health, with stronger effects when levels of chronic work stress were higher. Hypothesis testing was performed using cross -sectiona l and prospective regression analyses. The second research question focussed on the CSA hypothesis. Lower physiological stress reactivity and increased physiological stress recovery were expected for individuals with higher levels of PA (results not VIII shown) , as well as CRF. Physiological stress reactivity was defined as changes in HRV which were matched to the individuals' specific stress experiences. Physiological recovery was investigated by measuring HRV during the following night. Hypothesis testing was performed using multilevel models and regression analysis. Results : The validation studies supported the suitability of the applied questionnaires for the assessment of PA and burnout. The main finding was that no stress -buffering effects of PA appeared in the data. Furthermore, CRF partially occurred as a stress -buffer on the cross -sectional association between ERI scores and cardiovascular risk factors, whereas no stress -buffering effects occurred on metabolic syndrome and mental health. The second major finding was that PA did not appear to influence physiological stress reactivity or recovery. However, CRF partially buffered physiological stress reactivity, whereas no effect occurred on physiological stress recovery. CRF was related to a more favorable s tress reactivity regarding feelings of stress, whereas no effects occurred for feelings of anger, positive or negative affect. Aside from these main findings, PA was significantly and negatively correlated with metabolic syndrome scores after one year. CRF was a reliable significant predictor for lowered cardiovascular risk factors, including metabolic syndrome after one year. Additionally, CRF showed significant associations with more favorable day and night HRV levels. The present findings must be cautiou sly interpreted because of non -probability sampling. Furthermore, an inconsistent relationship between work stress and physiological outcomes might have lowered the detectable effects. This could be due to the high activity and fitness levels in the presen t sample, which may have entailed a ceiling effect. Conclusion : This is one of the first real -life studies examining the stress -buffering effects of PA and CRF in realistic circumstances and with such comprehensive methodology. In summary, CRF appeared as an important health resource with the potential to buffer some of the associations between stress and health risk factors. Therefore, the consistent and routine measurement of CRF should be addressed in occupational health programs for police officers, and constant efforts to encourage individuals to improve and preserve CRF levels should be made. PA has to be measured more precisely to elaborate acute and regular differences and interactions with fitness, and differences in leisure time and work -related PA , especially in a physically demanding work environment. Research with longer follow -up periods including continuous/multiple measurements is warranted to elaborate important health related effects and mechanisms more precisely. IX Zusammenfassung Hintergrun d: die Methoden Ecological Momentary Ambulatory Assessment (AA) auf Basis neuester Technol and h ealth Psychosocial stress is a major health threat in industrialized countries (Gerber & Schilling, 2018; Tomitaka et al., 2019) . Mental and physical illness can occur when optimal functioning of an individual's stress system is distorted. However, stress is not regarded as negative per se. Hans Selye, a pioneer in stress research, noted that stress reactions all sha re commonalities, leading him to describe the general adaptation syndrome of stress reactivity (Selye, 1950) . This syndrome consists of three phases; alarm, resistance, and exhaustion. In his first animal studies, Selye showed that the alarm phase and the resistance phase mobilized the biological system to succesfully overcome external demands. The animals would recover completely so long as they were not stressed to the point of exhaus tion. In this phase, the system collapses, ultimately leading to disease or death. These insights provided helpful explanations for the pathways between stress and disease (Goldstein & Kopin, 2007) . However, in early research, the term stress did not differentiate between the cause and the effect. Furthermore, Selye felt t hat stress is the \"salt of life\" (Selye, 1956) . This means that Selye understood stress as an essential part of life. On this understanding, constant stress -induced adaptations are necessary to survive. The absence of these demands and adaptati ons would be similar to death. Based on these more educated insights, Selye later referred to the cause of stress as a \"stressor \", and he divided stress into the positive \"eustress \" and negative \"distress \". In the present study, the term stress is used syn onymously with distress, as is the case in common parlance (Goldstein & Kopin, 2007) . Another important development in early stress resear ch is based on the work of Walter Cannon. Cannon understood the stress re lated physiological phenomena as a dynamic equilibrium counterbal ancing external demands. In this respect, Cannon coined the term homeostasis, which refers to the ongoing stabilizatio n and defense of vital physiological variables, such as blood pressure (Cannon, 1929) . The se stabilising responses appear ed to be goal -driven, which explains Cannon's phrase \"wisdom of the body\" (Cannon, 1932 ). These concepts provided by Selyse and Cannon shaped earliest stress research in the midth 19th century. I n line with these reaction -oriented concept s, research focused on specific stressors and responses. Major life events , chronic strains and daily hassles, have been identified as psychosocial stressors show ing important associations to health (Kasten & Fuchs, 2018) . Health -relevant physiological response patterns have been described for biological, psychological and behavioral phenomena (Kasten & Fuchs, 2018) . However, the idea of homeostasis did not sufficiently explain observable systemic adaptations to long -term stressors, 2 including variance in reactions to equal stressors or anticipatory reactions. In order to explain these adaptations and the link between stress and illness more accurately, sever al concepts have been proposed (Goldstein & Kopin, 2007) . To date, allostasis is the most wi dely accepted of these concepts (Ramsay & Woods, 2014; Sterling & Eyer, 1988) . Sterling and Eyer (1988) defined allostasis as achieving stability by change. More specifically, the defended baseline level cha nges in order to adequately cope with externally or internally presented demands (Ramsay & Woods, 2014) . Furthermore, optimal coping would be centrally commanded by regulatory processes in the brain (Ramsay & Woods, 2014) . More m odern models developed into an understanding of a transactional process between the individual and the environment (Lazarus, 1984) . Transactional stress models more a dequately account ed for the complexit y and individual ity of the stress process (Gerber, 2020; Lazarus, 1984) . In the presentation of transactional model s, stress depend s on how an individual's cognitive, endocrine, and nervous system perceives, processes and interprets external demands (primary appraisal), and the resources (secondary appraisal) available to manage them (McEwen & Gianaros, 2010) . This process can under go (multiple) r e-interpretations (reappraisal). While psychological stress has been shown to be consistently linked to discrete emotions, Lazarus and Cohen -Charash (2001) further supported the assumption that psychological stress and emotions are not seperable. The translation of these theoretical assumptions into measurable physiological manifestations draws on two main stress axes, predominantly assigned to the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and the neuroendocrine system. In acute stress situations, the sympathetic adrenal medullary (SAM) system activates the ANS (Pruessner & Ali, 2015) . In order to initialize th e so-called \"fight or flight\" response, sympathetic activity is increased immediately, whereas par asympathetic activity is reduced (Pruessner & Ali, 2015) . This leads to typical stress responses, such as an increased heart rate (HR) and decreased heart rate variability (HRV) (Uusitalo et al., 2011) . Mediated by adrenaline and noradrenaline (for example), blood pressure and platelet aggregation in the periphery increases (Pruessner & Ali, 2015; Veldhuijzen van Zanten et al., 2004) . Moreover, the brain is activated and the organism is provided with additional energy (Pruessner & Ali, 2015) . The hypothalamus - pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a neuroendocrine stress system (Allen, Kennedy, Cryan, Dinan, & Clarke, 2014) . Although slower in its process sequence than the ANS, th is axis is more reactive to psychosocial stressors. Even the anticipation of a threat can enhance HPA activity (Pruessner & Ali, 2015) . Scholars bel ieve that close interactions exist between these two stress systems, the immune system, and cognitive processes (perception of a stressor) (Pruessner & Ali, 2015; Uchino, Smith, Holt-Lunstad, Campo, & Reblin, 2007) . 3 Activities of the stress axes influence several effector systems. They range from executive cognitive functions to the reward and fear system, sleep -wake cycle mechanisms, growth, reproductive and thyroid hormone axes, and the gastrointestinal, cardiore spiratory, metabolic, and immune systems (Chrousos, 2009) . Consequently, a malfunctioning stress system can contribute to a multitude of health impairments. Chronically elevated level of stress have shown to be a salient risk factor for metabolic syndrome (MetS) (Gerber & Schilling, 2018; Kaltsas & Chrousos, 2007) . MetS is a cluster of risk factors , and considered a global burden due a close relation to cardiovascular disease (CVD) (Gaziano, 2012; Saklayen, 2018) . According to the World Organization (WHO, 2018) , CVD are the leadi ng cause of deaths worldwide. Psychosocial stress has shown to be a risk factor for CVD with an impact comparable to smoking or diabetes (Russ et al., 2012) . Furthermore, evidence implies a dose -response relationship between psychosocial stress and CVD - related premature death (Kaltsas & Chrousos, 2007; Russ e t al., 2012) . While ANS activity has been shown to mediate stress -induced hypertension and heart disease (Hering, Lachowska, & Schl aich, 2015) , psychosocial stress has been suggested to influence multiple cardiovascular mechanisms related to cardiac events (Bairey Merz et al., 2002) . 1.2 Occupational stress The occupational environment constitutes a major source of stress in western countries (American Psychological Association, 2017) . Despite efforts to decrease work stress, no substantial changes in prevalen ce have been achieved in Europe (Eurofound, 2017) . 2018, a Suisse -wide survey including 2946 participan ts, has shown that 27.1% of employees reported to be overly stressed (Gesundheitsf\u00f6rderung Schweiz, 2018) . These developments appear to be concerning, due to eviden ce indicating severe health consequences related to work stress. Literature reviews of cross - sectional and prospective studies have shown a strong association between work stress and CVD, with a doubled risk for future CVD in highly stressed individuals (Nyberg et al., 2013; Siegrist & Dragano, 2008) . Research on work stress has also highlighted the association between stress and mental well -being (Quick & Henderson, 2016) . This is noteworthy, as the social burden of mental disorders in high -income countries is tremendous, with costs estimated at 2.3 to 4.4% of the national gross domestic product (GDP) (Marquez & Saxena, 2016) . Depression is is the leading mental health impairment (Steinmann, 2005) . Based on their review of prospective epidemiologic studies, Siegrist and Dragano (2008) concluded that high occupational stress is associated with a 1.2 to 4.6 -fold increased risk for depression. Additionally, occupational stress has been described as the main cause of burnout among adult worke rs (Maslach, Schaufeli, & Leiter, 2001) , and seems to be closely associated with sleep complaints (Akerstedt et al., 2002) . Accordingly, costs associated with 4 occupational stress ( i.e., due to health care, absenteeism, presenteeism, reduced productivity, increased turnover) remain high, and have been estimated at 0.5 to 1.2% of the GDP (Guazzi et al., 2014) . This is in line with a recent report in Switzerland, estimating these costs to be 1% of the GDP (Gesundheitsf\u00f6rderung Schweiz, 2018) . Given the negative individual and societal consequences associated with occupational stress and psychosocial stress in general, finding ways to improve resiliency against stress is a major p ublic health concern (Kivim\u00e4ki et al., 2002; Semmer & Zapf, 2018) . In line with the above -mentioned theoretical foundations, work stress research applies transactional stress models (Lan dsbergis et al., 2017) . These models mainly account for cognitive evaluations of job related demands and resources in terms of a fit between the individual and the environment (Hart & Cooper, 2001) . Within this framework, stress occurs if the perceived demands of the work environment, and resources of the individ ual, do not balance (Landsbergis et al., 2017) . This fit or congruence has been characterized in the context of two components. The first is a demand - ability fit, which refers to the external demand that work imposes on the ind ividual, and the individual ability to meet this demand. The second is a fit between the individual's demands or needs and the provided or available resources (Dewe, O'Driscoll, & Cooper, 2012) . In this respect, modern, sophisticated models of occupational stress integrate complex environmental in teractions. The job demands and control (JDC) model, for example, evaluates perceived demands, such as time pressure and work overload. These demands are related to the perceived control, which is the decision latitude at work (Karasek, 1 979). The control component accounts for a lack of stimuli, information, and competencies. The effort -reward imbalance model, on the other hand, postulates that stress emerges due to a perceived mismatch in the calculation of job related costs and benefit s (Siegrist, 1996) . The effort component can emerge from external (tasks by a supervisor) as well as internal (overcommitment) sources. Reward, on the other hand, can be perceived as emotional and financial appreciation, but also job safety and gratification. JDC and ERI are two of the most widely accepted work stress models, and therefore, the focus of the current study. Different work stress models have been proposed in the literature, and the rapidly developing employment relationships of the 21st century encourage conceptual disscussions about adapted theoretical models (Kelliher, Richardson, & Boiarintseva, 2019; Mark & Smith, 2008) . However, to stay in the scope of this work, these will not be addressed here (see Dewe et al. (2012) and Mark and Smith (2008) for more information ). Based on the concepts described above, the implem entation of work stress management programs can focus on multiple factors. These factors can be narrowed down to two categories, work conditions and employee behaviour (verhaltens - und verh\u00e4ltnisbezogene Massnahmen) (Ulich, 2012) . Work conditions may include the reduction of stressors, such as tim e pressure or workload, 5 but also the creation of appealing work requirements, such as balanced variability and complexity. Behavioural strategies, on the other side, can aim to improve individual's resources, which may include stress management seminars an d health behaviour coaching (Ulich, 2012; Vincent, 2012) . In Switzerland, work related prevention of disease and health promotion are regulated on a federal level. Since the beginning of this century, the foundation \"Gesundheitsf\u00f6rderung Schweiz \" organizes projects that address stress management interventions in Switzerland. The SWiNG study, for example, provided evidence for the success of an intervention i n eight companies with more than 5000 employees (Gesundheitsf\u00f6rderung Schweiz, 2011) . The study showed positive influences on individual and organizational l evels that improved employees' perceived imbalance between resources and demands in 25% of all participants. While these results show the potential of appropriate occupational health management strategies, current federal law is mainly limited to occupatio nal safety and accident prevention. Based on these limitations, Gesundheitsf\u00f6rderung Schweiz (2020) provided quality standards, called \"Friendly Work Space\" , in 2009. However, a proposed federal law to improve the current legal framework was rejected in 2012, and the implementation of the mentioned quality criteria remains optional for com panies (Gesundheitsf\u00f6rderung Schweiz, 2020) . Until today, approximately 80 organizations, employing approximately 200.000 indiv iduals in total, use the label Friendly Work Space in Swit zerland . While these measures are promising, the situation for many employees in Switzerland remains adverse. In a nationwide study by Grutsch and Kressig (2015) , employees rated occupational health management as the most relevant work - and society -related issue. The second and third most relevant factors were wage settings and technolog ical resources. Furthermore, the results showed a discrepancy between the perceptions of demands for occupational health promotion between employers and employees. This discrepancy is particularly stark for supported psychological health in coping with occ upational strain (Grutsch & Kressig, 2015) . While these results show the relevance of occupational health promotion, in Switzerland, the prevalence of overly stressed employees has increased over the last six years (Gesundheitsf\u00f6rderung Schweiz, 2018) . These developments are concerning, and appropriate solutions to tackle the negative conseque nces of stress in the workplace are demanded. 1.3 Stress buffering effects of physical activity and fitness The health benefits of both physical activity (PA) and fitness are well -known (Myers et al., 2015; Pate et al., 1995) . PA is bodily movement \" exerted by skeletal muscles that results in energy expenditure above resting level\" (Caspersen, 1985, p.126). Fitness is the sum of attributes or characteristics an individual has or achieves, enabling to perform PA. These attributes can be health 6 and skill related (Ferguson, 2014) . This work generally considers health related fitness . Although fitness can be influenced by PA, particularly exercise, it is genetically determined and influenced by environmental factors (Martinez -Vizcaino & S\u00e1nchez -L\u00f3pez, 2008) . Although they are interrelated, insufficient levels of PA and fitness have been shown to be independent health risk factors (Ekelund et al., 2007; Myers, Kokkinos, & Nyelin, 2019; Myers et al., 2015) . Furthermore, fitness is suggested to predict health risk outcomes more accurately (Brown, 1991; Myers et al., 2015) . Since the early 80 s, scholars suggest stress -buffering effects of PA and fitness. While PA and resulting fitness have been shown to protect against the health impairments that are related to psychosocial stress (Van der Doef & Maes, 1999) , the mechanisms are less clear. The cross -stressor adaptation (CSA) hypothesis suggests that PA elicits a stress reaction in the human body, and that the organism's reactions to it are beneficial for different stressors (Sothmann et al., 1996) . These adaptations can result in more adequate physiological regulations in psychosocial stress situations (Gerber, 2012; Sothmann et al., 1996) . Furthermore, PA and fitness are both thought to improve psychological well -being and thus promote the ability to cope with psychological research on CSA focused on the effects of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) on stress reactivity and recovery (Crews & Landers, 1987) . However, t hree me ta-analysis examining laboratory studies showed heterogeneous results (Crews & Landers, 1987; Forcier et al., 2006; Jackson & Dishman, 2006) . In 1987, Crews and Landers revealed that CRF was negatively associated with stress reactivity. Almost 20 years later, Forcier et al. (2006) applied more strict inclusion criteria and found similar results, namely decreased stress reactivity and slightly increased stress recovery in more fit individuals. However, in the same year Jackson and Dishman (2006) published thei r work, showing that higher CF levels were not related to decreased stress reactivity, although stress recovery increased considerably. While Forcier et al. (2006) focused on ANS stress reactivity, Jackson and Dishman (2006) additionally included proxies of the HPA axis. Furthermore, the stressors a pplied in the included studies differed considerably, limiting the comparability of the mentioned results. With induced stressors ranging from cognitive and behavioral to physical challenges, some scholars have argued that related results are not comparabl e to studies applying psychosocial stressors (Hamer, 2012; Kasten & Fuchs, 2018) . Understanding psychosocial stress as a more specific concept, recent research has often applied the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) (Kirschbaum, Pirke, & Hellhammer, 1993) . Due to a combined application of psychosocial and cognitive stress, researchers consider the TSST more reliable (Allen et al., 2014) . The TSST has been shown to increase HPA and ANS axis activity, alter cardiovascular and immune system activity, and to heighten self -reported stress, 7 anxiety, and negative mood (Allen et al., 2014; Dickerson & Kemeny, 2004) . Nonetheless, only relatively few studies have tested the CSA hypothesis of PA and CRF with the TSST (M\u00fccke, Colledge, Evidence supporting red uced stress reactivity and recovery has been provided by Rimmele et al. (2007; 2009) , Childs and de Wit (2014) , and Klaperski et al. (2013; 2014). Klaperski et al. (2014) , for example, tested a twelve -week exercise intervention on stress reactivity and recovery in a randomized controlled trial. Participants improved their CRF and showed significantly reduced stress reactivity across all parameters (HR, HRV, and salivary cortisol). Little to no support for the CSA hypothesis was found by Puterman et al. (2011) , Strahler et al. (2016) , Jayasinghe et al. (2016) , and M\u00fccke et al. (2020) . The comparison of these results is difficult for methodological reasons. Both concepts, physical fitness and PA, are closely related, but have shown to be independent health factors (Myers et al., 2015) . However, most studies on the CSA hypothesis focused on PA or fitness separately, or employed exercise to increase fitness. Additionally, biopsychological reactions have not been measured consistently; i.e. con sidering both stress axes (Puterman et al., 2010) . Furthermore, the degree to which the se results can be translated from the laboratory to real -life remains unclear. Scholars argue that, although psychosocial stress is induced in laboratory studies (TSST), participants might not perceive the stressor tasks as personally relevant (Wilhelm, Pfaltz, & Grossman, 2006; Zanstra & Johnston, 2011) . This is aggregated by the fact that these stressors are short -term and can be solved with specific coping skills, whereas stress in real -life is more chronic and c omplex, and thus requires a more complete repertoire of coping skills (von Haaren et al., 2016; Wilhelm et al., 2006; Zanstra & Johnston, 2011) . Therefore, some authors have claimed that in future research, the impact of stress on stress reactivity and well -being should be empirically tested in naturalistic circumstances under more ecologically valid conditions (Lucini, Norbiato, Clerici, & Pagani, 2002) . 1.4 Challenges in real-life studies As mentioned above, the work environment represents a substantial source of stress in industrialized countries (American Psychological Association, 2017) . Furthermore, an interaction between PA and CRF with work stress, which may lower the negative consequences for m ental and cardiovascular health, has been posited. In a 30 -year follow -up study, Holtermann et al. (2010) found that, in participants (men) with low fitness levels, higher physical work demands were related to higher risk o f ischemic heart disease and all -cause mortality. This relationship did not occur for participants with high fitness levels, if compared to participants with low physical work demands, which corroborates the expected stress -buffering effects of fitness. Wh ile existing studies generally supported stress -buffering effects of PA and fitness on health, to date, occupational stress has not 8 been sufficiently examined (Gerber et al., 2016; Schmidt, Beck, Rivkin, & Diestel, 2016) . Previous studies on the topic have mainly used retrospective self -reports as proxies for all variables of & Melamed, 2006) . However, retrospective self -reports entail some considerable limitations in the research on psychophysiological phenomena. In general, recall bias and social desirability might distort the results of subjective reports (Adamo, Prince, Tricco, Connor -Gorber, & Tremblay, 2009; Prince et 2008) . More specifically, aggregated mean values of dynamically changing phenomena, such as stress , may show different associations than multiple acute ass essments (Lischetzke, 2014) . Redelmeier and Kahneman (1996) presented striking results on this topic when they examined pain experiences in colonoscopy patient s. Surprisingly, retrospective reports were heavily influenced by peaks and endings of pain experiences, whereas durations disregarded (Zajchowski, Schwab, & Dustin, 2016) . Consequently, Kahne mann (2011) introduced the concept of two selves, the \"experiencing self\" and the \"remembering self\" ; whereas the former represents momentary cognitive, affective, and behavioral responses, the latter interprets experiences, which depends on accuracy of retrieval and reasonable integration (Kahnemann, 2005; Ward & Garety, 2019) . Therefore, in order to more directly examine stress responses, a key area of resea rch is the real -time assessment of the experiencing self . Another aspect supporting the demand for multiple momentary assessments relates to the theoretical framework that posits individual differences in the stress process. Intra -individual differences in dynamic processes of interpreting and re -evaluating ex periences requires study designs beyond inter aggregated levels might lead to misinterpre tations due to different variations of variables on differ ent levels (Shiffman 2008). These misinterpretations may arise from low or even negative correlations of both levels. A vivid example of the differences that can occur between intra -individual and i nter-individual correlations is the association of PA and blood pressure. While values of regular PA are related to reduced blood pressure on an inter - individual level, higher levels of PA are associated with higher blood pressure ( i.e. climbing stairs) on an intra -individual level (Kamarck, Schwartz, Janicki, Shiffman, & Raynor, 2003) . Further considerations support the need for multiple assessments in real -time. Dunton (2017) summarised these considerations wi th the terms synchronicity, sequentiality, and instability. Parameters that co -occur in time and within individuals (synchronicity), that are presumed to be temporal antecedents and consequences/postcedents (sequentiality), and that fluctuate over time and within individuals (instability), cannot be sufficiently accounted for by global retrospective measures. Taken together, different methodologies are needed to build upon current assumptions, and 9 particularly to determine possible mechanisms underlying str ess-buffering effects in terms of the CSA hypothesis (Dunton, 2017) . Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is the methodological response to these limitations and requirements (Shiffman, Stone, & Hufford, 2008) . The definition of EMA employed here is the simultaneous assessment of multiple psychological parameters in close -to-real time and in the subject's natural environment (Stone & Shiffman, 1994) . These chara cteristics are highly sought after by researchers, in order to capture emotional -affective representations of stress as they occur, rather than necessitating long recall times (Kahnemann, 2005; Kasten & Fuchs, 2018) . The definition for EMA used here refers to paper -pencil methods, as well as technological solutions (Shiffman et al., 2008) . Paper -pencil me thods have been in use for decades (Dunton, 2017) . Newer approaches linked these methods to technology with diary prompts, where a random alarm invited the participants to write about their current emotions or thoughts (deVries, 1992; Hektner, Schmidt, & Csikszentmihalyi, 2007) . The most recent developments in handheld computers and smartphones have opened up entirely new opportunities. As such portable electronic devices become more common, t hey become less costly, and participants are comfortable with using them (Dunton, 2017; Kasten & Fuchs, 2018) . Furthermore, these technologies have the capacity to enable quick data collection from large samples, while the data processing is simplified using remote servers and software that prepares data for analyses (Dunton, 2017) . Additionally, statistical analyses of the resulting data have developed rapidly. Today, general consensus has be en reached about the appropriateness of multilevel models to account for the necessities related to intra -individual data (Beal & Weiss, 2003) . In summary, EMA provides a methodological tool for studying momentary processes in realistic settings. This technique offers an adequate logical, operational and analytical approach to minimize shortcomings of traditional self -reports, i.e. recall bias (Beal & Weiss, 2003) . The invariability in previous res earch may be attributable to methodological developments, or limited realization of the need for momentary assessments in order to support theoretical models. Another explanation may be the technological challenges assessing psychophysiological stress meas ures in real life (Shiffman et al., 2008) . However, technological developments have also lead to significant improvemen ts in capturing physiological data. New technologies in Ambulatory Assessment (AA) have yielded devices that can be worn on a small chest strap, which measure a multitude of physiological parameters, including heart rate, movement, temperature, light, air pressure, and even geo -location as an umbrella term (Fahrenberg, Myrtek, Pawlik, & Perrez, 2007) , it will be used to refer to the continuous assessment of physiological parameters in the present work. In stress research, t he AA method has shown its potential to adequately capture SAM axis activity in 10 real-world observations (Kasten & become a popular and frequently used parameter, depicting the SAM axis activity more precisely while containing more information than blood pressure and HR alone (Kasten & Fuchs, 2018; Shaffer & Ginsberg, 2017) . Furthermore, HR and HRV have been show n to be independently related to stress (Pieper, Brosschot, van der Leeden, & Thayer, 2007) . HRV is defined by fluctuations of time intervals between successive heartbeats (N -N intervals), measured in milliseconds. These differences can be attributed to parasympathetic branches of the SAM axis having an influence on sympathetic activity as well (Shaffer & Ginsberg, 2017) . Different parameters can be calculated from interbeat intervals, which are attributed to time and frequency domains. This work will mainly focus on time domain parameter root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), as one of the most frequently e xamined HRV parameters. RMSSD is relatively free from respiratory influences ( i.e. compared to high frequency power), which is an important advantage in situations where respiration frequency might not be accessible, as is this case in real -life measuremen ts (Laborde, Mosley, & Thayer, 2017) has been related to mental and physiological health (Taylor, 2010) , evidence links stress -related differences in HRV with CVD (Hillebrand et al., 2013) and mortality risk (La Rovere, Bigger, Marcus, Mortara, & Schwartz, 1998) . Studies that combined AA with EMA are relatively rare, but have shown that HRV (RMSSD) is related to stre ss responses in teachers and hospital worker s (Pieper et al., 2007; Uusitalo et al., 2011) . In a unique real -life study , von Haaren et al. (2016) have combined A A and EMA t o examine the CSA hypothesis. In a randomized controlled trial with sedentary un iversity students, aerobic exercise training (20 weeks) increased CRF in the intervention group, which then showed a significantly improved stress re sponse (measured as HRV) du ring their examination period. A review by Tonello et al. (2014) has shown the current state of research on the general topic of stress -buffering effects of PA and fitness in relation to work stress and HRV. While the authors reported a generally negative interconnection between work stress and HRV, no conclusion could be drawn in regard to PA and fitness . The reason for that was a lack of studies assessing the respective outcomes or reporting possible interactions (Tonello et al., 2014) . Taken together, HRV is a feasible an d reliable measure of SAM axis activity related to stress. EMA and AA are promising methodologies for research questions highly demanded to build upon current knowledge. Promising results from real - life studies support the CSA hypothesis . However , studies examining personally relevant stressors in realistic contexts with appropriate methodologies are largely underrepresented (Gerber & Fuchs, 2018) . 11 1.5 Real -life s tress in police officers As mentioned above, a major source of stress in everyday life is the workplace. In order to investigate work stress, police officers represent a uniquely interesting population, as they are exposed to several acute and chronic stressors (Brown & Campbell, 1990; McCreary & Thompson, 2006). These stressors include dealing with death, disaster, violence, and sexual crime (McCreary & Thompson, 2006). Police officers have to deal with primary victims of crime as well as offenders. Additionally, potentially armed suspects represent unpredictable life threats that further demand critical decision-making under high pressure (Deschamps, 2014). Given these operational stressors, police officers' perceived demand for organizational support can be high, and reports of organizational stressors are frequent. Reported organizational stressors include a lack of support by supervisors, shortage of manpower and equipment, and interactions with the public (Burke & Mikkelsen, 2006) . Additionally, police work is organized in strict hierarchical structures. Within these structures, police officers encounter little autonomy, since they have to follow department rules. These rules regulate almost all activities that have to be carried out and reported within the range of standardized operational processes (Brown & Campbell, 1990). Consequently, police officers often report other, less risk-related stressors, such as disproportionate amount of paperwork, repetitive tasks, and courtroom appearances (Violanti et al., 2017). Furthermore, unpredictable long working hours and changing shift work cycles have been shown to be relevant stress factors in police officers (Deschamps et al., 2003). Shift work is generally known to be related to several negative health outcomes, including professional spillover (Landsbergis et al., 2017). Professional spillover, which refers to the effect of work life on different personal domains, is particularly meaningful in police officers. Police officers practice and employ thoughts and behaviors that are necessary for their job, such as emotional distancing, which can be problematic in their private lives (Johnson et al., 2005) . Professional spillover can further lead to work and family conflict, which has often been reported in police officers (Hall, Dollard, Tuckey, Winefield, & Thompson, 2010). Additionally, recent societal changes influence police officers' work, and the consequences of these changes for stress experiences have not yet been studied. Cybercrime, human trafficking and terrorism are some examples of new challenges police officers have to face (Campion & Rousseaux, 2015). As emphasized by Waters and Ussery (2007), while police officers start their career in excellent health, some may develop severe health problems due to the cumulative impact of stress experienced in the line of duty. Reports on stress-related health issues include sleep complaints (Garbarino, Guglielmi, Puntoni, Bragazzi, & Magnavita, 2019), decreased quality of life, burnout, 12 smoking, alcohol consumption (McCarty, Aldirawi, Dewald, Magnavita, 2017) . While resulting impairments in performance, increased sic k leave and early retirement are associated with organizational and societal costs (Collins & Gibbs, 2003) , adequate job performance is also, in this particular profession, essential for public s afety (Waters & Ussery, 2007) . Given these circumstances, the current study specifically focused on police officers of the canton Basel -Stadt. While research generally supports the aforementioned stress experiences in Swiss police officers (Arial, Gonik, Wild, al., 2017) , some peculiarities must be mentioned. The shift work schedule for employees of the police corps Basel City is a regular six -day cycle ( see APPENDIX 1). This cycle is generally the same for all employees , although it may differ slightly in certain exceptional circumstances. Although stable shift work cycles are regarded as beneficial for health, the shift work status of police officers in Basel -Stadt has shown to be related to perceived stress and sleep c omplaints (Gerber et al., 2010a; Gerber et al., 2013b) . Furthermore, Basel is one of the larger cities in Switzerland, directly adjacent to Germany and France. Therefore, European open borders and related internati onal traffic influence police work, a particular difference compared to other cantons. In this respect, illegal immigration, international crime and terrorism are well-recognized challenges (Eidgen\u00f6ssisches Justiz - und Polizeidepartement, 2020; Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft, . However, t he police force of Basel -Stadt does not have a conceptual approach to systematically manage occu pational health. While stress management seminars are part of educational elements, no regular programs and evaluations are carried out. In summary, police officers experience a multitude of stressors, with evidence supporting increased work related stress in international and Swiss samples (Arial et al., 2010; Gerber et al., 2010a; Violanti et al., 2017) . Furthermore, police officers have been shown to be at risk for mal adaptive coping strategies (Aaron, 2000) . For example, seeking professional assistance for stress management may be seen as a weakness (Richmond et al., 1999). Therefore, research in police officers is highly warranted, yet still underrepresented (Violanti et al., 2017) . 1.6 Summary and study outline In past research, much evidence has accu mulated demonstrating the negative impact of occupational stress on workers' health. Developing promising health resources to counteract the negative consequences of psychosocial stress is of the utmost importance. In this respect, previous 13 research suppor ts the potential of PA and physical fitness as stress -buffers. While empirical evidence from laboratory studies is conflicting to some extent, real -life studies showed promising findings, but are scarce. Further research is warranted to elaborate previous findings with a comprehensive methodology in externally valid conditions. While stress at work is a well -known real -life stressor, research on stress -buffering effects of PA and fitness, particularly in stressful occupations, is lacking . Based on this bac kground, the aim of the research presented here was to examine stress - buffer ing effects of PA and CRF in a real -life work environment. Following an empirical -analytical approach, traditional self -report measures were combined in a unique study design using new technologies (AA and EMA) in a longitudinal observational study. Exposure to chronic and acute work stress was examined alongside physiological and psychological health parameters twice within one year. PA was assessed over seven consecutive days via accelerometry, substantiated by a recently developed and validated questionnaire (Simple Physical Activity Questionnaire; SIMPAQ). CRF was objectively measured with the submaximal \u00c5strand cycling test. Cardio metabolic risk factors (including MetS ) were assessed in a laboratory alongside of psychological health outcomes (i.e. burnout, and sleep health) using validated a nd widely accepted instruments. Chronic work stress was observed with two of the most widely applied work stress questionnaires based on the job demand and control (JDC) model (Karasek, 1979) , as well as the effort -reward imbalance (ERI) model (Siegris t, Siegrist, & Weber, 1986) . Occupational stress, as quantified with these models, has been shown to be related to decreased psychological wellbeing ( i.e. burnout, anxiety, impaired sleep quality) and physiological health ( i.e. coronary heart disease, musculoskeletal disease), as well as increased mortality risk (Kivim\u00e4ki et al., 2002; Matthews, Gump, & Owens, 2001; Seiler, 2014; Siegrist & Dragano, 2008) . Acute work stress was measured using smartphone -based Ecolo gical Momentary Assessment, whereas physiological reactivity and recovery were captured using AA of HRV (Linden, Earle , Gerin, & Christenfeld, 1997) . An overview of the study procedure is presented in the Appendix (see APPENDIX 2) . The candidate's accomplishments included creating the project idea to examine the research question. This constitutes the development of a s tudy design, choice of methodology and instruments. The candidate further established a cooperatio n with the police corps of the c anton Basel -Stadt in order to obtain an appropriate sample. Furthermore, the candidate prepared and convoyed the corresponding proposal to and approval of the local ethics committee. In the execution of the study, the candidate organized the recruitment (including video presentations, E -Learning materials, internal journals, and E -Mail), built and managed the infrastructure to ex ecute the study in terms of data assessment (external laboratory) and secure data storage. Next to the assessment, storage, preparation and analysis of the data, the candidate coached and supervised study person nel for data assessment 14 and optional lifestyle -coaching. The candidate generated five project related publications (three published, two under review), visualized and presented study results to the scientific community.

The general goal of the present doctoral research project was to examine the well -founded but understudied possibility of stress -buffering effects of PA and CRF . While p revious studies showed inconsistencies that may be related to the artificiality of applied laboratory stressors , the present research project was conducted to provide new insig hts in realistic stress experiences . Therefore, the first aim (1) of this research endeavour was to test buffering effects of PA and CRF on the association between chronic work stress and cardio metabolic , as well as mental health. The second aim (2) was to test underlying mechanisms in terms of the CSA hypothesis . The use of personally meaningful real-life stressors assessed by EMA and AA was employed to increase external validity compared to previous research. Using an empirical -analytical approach, a one -year prospective observational study was conducted in a sample of police officers. (1) The first aim was addressed by cross -sectional and prospective analyses of the association between chronic work stress and (cardio metabolic and mental) health factors, a nd the influence (interaction effects) of PA and CRF. Well established and widely applied traditional methods were used, primarily based on laboratory and self -report measurements. (2) Newer methodologies, based on EMA and AA, were used to address the seco nd aim of testing underlying mechanisms. Individual differences in the psychophysiological stress response of the ANS were examined using multiple measurements of work stress experiences. Hypotheses: (1) Higher levels of PA and CRF are associated with imp roved cardio metabolic and mental health related to increased chronic w ork stress (Gerber et al., 2016; PA and CRF are associat ed with lowered physiological stress reactivity in acute work stress situations and improved recovery related to acute and chronic work stress (Hynynen, Konttinen, 2016) . 16 3.Publications The research project cumulated five publications that were submitted to international peer -reviewed journals. Three of these publications were accepted, whereas two are cur rently under review.

Background Todocument lifestyle [1],itisessential and health scientists toaccurately assess physical activity [2,3].Reliable and validated tools areessential tomeasure prevalence rates, estimate risk ratios, monitor changes inphysical activity levels, and toformu- latepublic health recommendations forspecific target groups [2,4]. Although some researchers argued that doubly labeled water technique and accelerometers should beseen asthegold standard toassess physical activity [3,5,6],doubly labeled water only provides information about energy expenditure, without providing information about time spent inphysical activity atdifferent intensity levels orindifferent contexts. Moreover, thistechnique isexpensive and complex, and thus notsuited forepidemiological research or clinical settings, where information measure activities such asrowing, biking, and weight lifting [6,7].Although combined with heart rate, accelerometers canprovide more detailed information about physical activity participation, they arestillnotcommonly used in clinical practice [7].Most likely thisisduetorelatively high costs, theburden placed onthe participants (because must from thepartici- and data isimmediately available [7].This may explain why self-report measures are widely used inresearch and clinical practice [2].Nevertheless, some questions have been raised about thevalidity ofphysical activity questionnaires [2,3,7].Existing self-report instruments, such astheInternational Physical Questionnaire (IPAQ), were activity levels Correlations with objective measures have frequently been found toberelatively modest, although statistically significant inthelarge scale studies inwhich they aretypically evaluated [11]. Another widely used instru- ment, theSeven-Day Physical Activity Recall (7DPAR), does notassess sedentary behavior, and correlations with accelerometer data were moderate formost measures obtained and also may both over- orunderestimate physical activity levels [11\u00b113]. Abrief, yetcomprehensive instrument (SIMPAQ) [10], wasdeveloped with theaim ofmore accurately assessing physical activity. The current exploratory study wasundertaken tocompare thisnew tool with existing activity inaconvenience sample ofhealthy young adults attending university tostudy exercise and health science.

One student dropped out, seven students hadtobeexcluded because oftechnical reasons sample consisted of72students (36men, 36 women). Procedures Students were informed about thestudy during alecture inthespring term (April toMay 2016). After providing informed consent, students who wished totake part inthestudy pro- vided information about anthropometry and demographic background including gender, age, weight, height, living situation, relationship status, and health status. Participants were given anaccelerometer (ActiGraph1wGT3X-BT, Actigraph, Pensacola, USA), were participant tosystem- atically document periods when they didnotwear theaccelerometer.

Physical activities listed onthenon-wear time sheet were included asmoderate physical activity ifthey days ofnon-wear time wascalculated using theCole-Kripke [20] algorithm with sleep period detection options provided byActiGraph1. Weekly scores were obtained bydividing thesum ofallvalid days through thenumber ofvalid days, and then multiplying byseven. The following indices were examined (inmin perweek): sleep, sedentary activity, light physical The isabrief five-item tool, which comprehensively evaluates activity over thepast seven days including time inbed, sedentary time, time spent walking, type and time spent inexercise, and time spent forother activities [10]. Assessed physical activity refers toalldomains ofactivity, including leisure time, domestic, work and transport-related activities. The SIMPAQ captures a24-hour period representative fortheprevious week. Anadditional sixth item (time spent standing) was added totheSIMPAQ inthepresent study, based onexperience inthishealthy young adult group obtained during pilot testing oftheSIMPAQ, which took place before theofficial start ofthedata assessment and wascarried outwith three staff members of Exercise werigorously followed theprocedure setoutbyBrislin items were translated into German, and then back-translated into English byaninde- pendent translator (see supporting information S1Figforthewording ofGerman items, see version gener- ated (inmin/week): time inbed, sedentary time, time spent standing, time spent walking, other physical activities, and exercise. Seven-Day Physical Activity Recall (7DPAR). The 7DPAR isawidely-used instrument toassess physical activity areasked report time spent inbedand then time forphysical activities with\u001510 min duration and atleast moderate intensity (inthe morning, afternoon and evening) [15]. The 7DPAR starts with theprevious day, and then refers toprior preceding days. Participants were asked toclassify theintensity ofthereported activities into moderate, hard orvery hard. Inthefollowing, hard and very hard intensity were considered asvigorous and very vigorous intheinterest ofuniformity and clarity. The inter- viewers also assessed breaks during theactivities, which arethen subtracted from total activity time. Foreach day, additional information about time spent instrength and flexibility training isassessed. The 7DPAR provides information about sleep, moderate physical activity (MPA), vigorous physical activity (VPA), strength training, and flexibility training. Statistical analyses Allanalyses were conducted with SPSS Statistics 23forWindows (IBM Corporation, Armonk, USA). Throughout allanalyses, thelevel ofthesample and thelevel ofself-reported and assessed physical activity. Normality wastested with Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Asnotallparameters were distributed normally, Spearman correlation analyses were computed tostudy pairwise associations between indicators ofself-reported and objectively assessed activity (allreferring tothe7days prior tothetelephone interview). Spear- man correlations toexamine bivariate relationships between theSIMPAQ and tocomplete theSIMPAQ and 7DPAR and their usability differed from each other. Univariate outliers, defined at\u00153standard deviations from themean, were identified, forthetime intheanalyses, 36answered theSIMPAQ first, and 36 answered the7DPAR first. Males and females were both equally represented inthesample (36 each), with 18males and 18females first completing theSIMPAQ or7DPAR, respectively. Most arephysically healthy whereas 3par- ticipants (4%) indicated that they currently hadaninjury, which prevented them from running for15minutes. Fifty-six participants (78%) were undergraduate students, 16(22%) were mas- students. The average ageoftheparticipants was22.6\u00b12.2 years, ranging from 19to29 years.

Nevertheless, both walking and other physical activities were correlated with total number ofaccelerometer- based steps. Similar correlations were observed foraccelerometer data with theSIMPAQ and the 7DPAR, suggesting that criterion validity wasacceptable forboth interview-based instruments.

To assess dimensions of burnout, the Shirom-Melamed Burnout Measure (SMB M) is widely used, but its validity and reliability have rarely been examined in adult samples. The aim of this study is to examine the psychometric properties of the German version of the SMB M in two independent samples of adults. In total, 311 adult workers and 201 police officers completed the SMB M, and questionnaires related to perceived stress and mental well-being. Descriptive statistics, internal consistency, convergent validity, and factorial validity were assessed for both samples, separately for male and female participants. The German SMB M had adequate psychometric properties and sufficient convergent validity. In confirmatory factor analyses, we found a good fit for both the first- and second-order model. Furthermore, measurement invariance across gender was observed in both samples. Although the SMB M is a popular instrument among burnout researchers, this study demonstrates for the first time that the SMB M can be considered a valid and reliable tool to assess burnout symptoms in both male and female adults and across different professional groups. Furthermore, with its 14 items, the SMB M is a succinct and economic self-assessment tool for symptoms of burnout. Keywords: burnout, validation, psychometric properties, internal consistency, mental health, stress INTRODUCTION Burnout can be defined as an occupational syndrome consisting of emotional, physical, and cognitive exhaustion ( 1). While there is broad consensus that people with burnout require medical and psychiatric treatment, there has been constant debate as to whether burnout should be considered a specific and well-defined psychiatric disorder, an epiphenomenon of a major depressive disorder (ICD-10: F33.xx), an adjustment disorder (ICD-10: F43.xx) ( 2-7), or a form of chronic fatigue syndrome (ICD-10: G93.3). Bianchi et al. ( 8) argue that there is such a strong Psychometric Properties and Convergent Validity of the SMB M Schilling et al. 2 August 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 536 Frontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.orgoverlap between burnout and depression that burnout should not be considered as a specific job-related phenomenon, but rather as a depressive condition. However, others argue that the two constructs are distinct ( 9) and that burnout syndrome should be given the status of an occupational disease ( 10, 11). Currently, there are no conclusive diagnostic criteria (11, 12), and to date, the condition is not included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th Edition) (DSM 5) ( 13). In the 11th version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11), however, \"burnout\" is classified under QD85 and is defined as \"a syndrome conceptualized as resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed\" (see https://icd.who.int/ browse11/l-m/en#/http://id.who.int/icd/entity/129180281 ). The ICD-11 definition highlights that burnout is a work-related phenomenon and thus not suitable for the description of experiences in other life domains. The Swedish Health System recognizes burnout as a psychiatric disorder; therapeutic interventions and sick leave for affected individuals are standard treatment forms ( 14, 15). Moreover, a recent Europe-wide study concludes that 9 of 23 European countries currently consider acknowledging burnout as an occupational disease ( 16) [see also Refs. ( 10, 11, 17)]. Irrespective of diagnostic issues, we observe that burnout is a serious public health problem and therefore a cause for concern for policy makers, patients, and health insurance organizations ( 18). To assess dimensions of burnout, the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) is the most widely used instrument ( 19, 20). Maslach et al. ( 21) defined burnout as a (multidimensional) psychological syndrome consisting of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization/ cynicism, and reduced personal accomplishment. Consequently, burnout is often considered synonymous with the definition provided by Maslach and colleagues ( 21-23). This also holds true for the new ICD-11 definition, where burnout is characterized by three dimensions, namely, \"the feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion, increased mental distance from one's job, or feelings of negativism or cynicism related to one's job, and reduced professional efficacy. \" Nevertheless, the theoretical and scientific basis of the MBI has been questioned (19, 20, 24), especially in light of the fact that the three burnout dimensions were not deducted theoretically but are the result of exploratory factor analysis. In addition, it has been argued that the depersonalization/cynicism and reduced personal accomplishment subscales do not adequately represent the core of the burnout construct. By contrast, Shirom, Melamed, and colleagues took the basic tenets of the Conservation of Resources (COR) theory (25, 26) into consideration. The resulting definition of burnout included an individual's feeling of being emotionally exhausted, physically fatigued, and cognitively worn-out ( 18, 27). Briefly, the COR theory assumes that people have a basic motivation to obtain, retain, and protect the resources that they value (28, 29). Accordingly, the chronic depletion of an individual's energetic resources following prolonged exposure to emotionally charged demands has been identified as the unique content of the burnout construct ( 30-32). More specifically, physical fatigue refers to an individual's feelings of tiredness and low levels of energy in carrying out daily tasks at work (or in general life) (p. 330) ( 27). Emotional exhaustion, on the other hand, describes the interpersonal aspect of burnout, \"namely, feeling that one lacks the energy needed to invest in relationships with other people at work\" (p. 330) ( 27). Finally, cognitive weariness describes the phenomenon of slower thinking and impaired mental agility. Melamed et al. ( 27, 31, 33) further hypothesized that this definition of burnout is distinct from a temporary state of fatigue, which generally disappears after a reasonable period of rest. Furthermore, Lundgren-Nilsson et al. ( 20) claimed that \"this conceptualization of burnout has been proven useful, not only to measure burnout in working populations, but also in clinical populations of patients seeking medical care due to stress-related exhaustion\" (p. 1). Using Shirom and Melamed's ( 18, 27) definition of burnout, research has shown associations between burnout and both physiological and psychological health outcomes. Physiologically, higher burnout scores are associated with increased cardiovascular risk factors, including increased fasting glucose and cholesterol levels ( 31, 34-36), increased cortisol levels throughout the day ( 33), an elevated cortisol awakening response ( 37), increased leukocyte adhesiveness ( 32), increased inflammatory markers ( 35, 38), increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes ( 39, 40), increased risk of musculoskeletal pain (41), and a higher likelihood of infertility ( 42). As regards psychological dimensions, data from vocational students and adult workers have shown that higher burnout levels are associated with reduced life satisfaction and quality of sleep (33, 43, 44). Similarly, significant associations have been found between burnout and depression, although the level of overlap varied considerably ( 38, 45-48). Moreover, in the clinical setting, Glise et al. ( 14) showed that among individuals with diagnosed job-related exhaustion disorder, ~90% displayed severe burnout scores. Finally, a multimodal treatment approach has been shown to lead to a reduction of burnout symptoms in the majority of patients ( 15, 49). The Shirom-Melamed Burnout Questionnaire (SMB Q) was devised to assess this COR-inspired definition of burnout. The questionnaire consists of eight items to assess symptoms of physical fatigue and emotional exhaustion (e.g., \"I feel physically exhausted. \") and four items to assess tension (e.g., \"I am tense. \") and listlessness (e.g., \"I feel sleepy. \"), respectively ( 30, 31). A distinction between tension and listlessness was made because the development of burnout was originally considered as a two- phase process, with tension being predominant in the early stages when active and direct coping strategies are employed to enhance and protect resources, and listlessness being characteristic of the more advanced stages when indirect and inactive coping prevails and burnout becomes more closely linked with apathy and depression ( 31). Answer options on the SMB Q 7-point Likert scale range from 1 (almost never) to 7 (almost always), with higher scores reflecting a higher degree of self-rated burnout. Norlund et al. ( 50) employed the SMB Q among a sample of 1,000 participants representative of the general population in Northern Sweden: Using an (arbitrary) cut-off of 4.0, the authors showed that 9.9% of all men and 15.9% of all women reported high burnout levels, while the level of burnout decreased with age Psychometric Properties and Convergent Validity of the SMBM Schilling et al. 3 August 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 536 Frontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.orgacross both genders. Furthermore, in another epidemiological study with 2,694 health care and social insurance workers from the Gothenburg region ( 51), the prevalence of employees reporting high burnout (4.0) was considerably higher (24%), indicating that burnout prevalence rates might vary strongly as a function of age, gender, job, and sample. To cope with some methodological issues, the Shirom- Melamed Burnout Questionnaire (SMBQ ) was revised to form the 14-item Shirom-Melamed Burnout Measure (SMBM ). In contrast to the SMBQ , the SBMM is composed of three subscales, namely, emotional exhaustion, physical fatigue, and cognitive weariness (32, 33). While the items of the first two dimensions were identical to those of the SMBQ , items related to cognitive weariness were added to assess the cognitive component of burnout (e.g., \"Myhead is not clear. \" or \"It is hard for me to think about complicated things. \"). This extension seemed plausible as cognitive weariness has been defined as a core dimension of burnout (18, 27). Both the SMBQ and SMBM are employed in burnout research (see literature presented above), and the SMB M has been translated from English into several languages, including Czech, French, German, Hebrew, Polish, Russian, and Spanish (see www.shirom.org/arie/index.html#). However, the validity and psychometric properties of these translations have not been evaluated systematically. What is known so far is that the SMB Q/ SMB M overall indices and subscales have satisfactory internal consistency (14, 19, 24, 30-31, 32, 37, 40, 52), with Cronbach's alpha values generally exceeding accepted standards ( 0.70) (53). Furthermore, the SMB Q/SMBM have a relatively high time stability, with correlations of r 0.50 across follow-up periods of several years (39, 40, 54). With regard to the convergent validity, evidence suggests that burnout is closely associated with individuals' chronic stress exposure ( 19, 50, 52, 55-57). Moreover, the SMBM and other burnout measures such as the MBI were reasonably correlated with each other. As expected, particularly high correlations were observed between the SMB Q/SMBM and the emotional exhaustion subscale of the MBI ( 19, 35). As reported previously, several longitudinal studies have confirmed that the SMBQ/SMBM instruments were able to predict specific physiological variables in the expected directions (e.g., cardiovascular disease risk factors, inflammatory biomarkers), thus underscoring the predictive validity of these questionnaires (27). Evidence has also suggested that at least moderate correlations exist between the SMBQ/SMBM and symptoms of depression and anxiety ( 45, 52). Preliminary results support the factorial validity of the SMBM: In a study with 717 Chinese hospital nurses, Qiao and Schaufeli ( 23) showed that a three- factor model achieved sufficient model fit, with the three factors being strongly correlated (r = 0.61-0. 73, p < 0.001). Moreover, in a sample of 214 Canadian employees, Sassi and Neveu (24) observed that a three-factor model resulted in a better model-fit than a one-factor solution. Again, a good fit was found between the three-factor model and the empirical data. Moreover, the three factors were moderately-to-strongly associated with each other ( r = 0.38-0.58, p < 0.001). Finally, Lundgren-Nilsson et al. (20) used both Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and Rasch analysis to assess the construct validity of the SMBQ; their analyses showed that after removal of the items representing the tension subscale, an 18-item version of the SMBQ satisfied modern measurement standards. Most importantly, a cut-off of 4.40 for severe or clinically relevant burnout was suggested. With this cut-off, 83.4% of their clinical sample of patients suffering from job-related exhaustion disorder were placed above the cut, whereas 86.5% of the general population sample of health care and social insurance workers were categorized below the cut. In summary, preliminary evidence supports the validity of the SMB M, while studies examining the psychometric properties and validity of the different language versions of the SMB M are still rare. To the best of our knowledge, only the French and Chinese versions of the SMBM have been examined systematically. Given this background, the main purpose of the present study was to validate the German version of the SMB M across two different samples. We hold that the present study is important for several reasons: First, many scholars have used the SMBM during the last 25 years to assess burnout symptoms, and this holds true in German-speaking samples ( 44, 58, 59). Second, although it is well documented that men and women differ with regard to burnout prevalence (44, 50, 57), we are not aware of any study examining whether the psychometric properties of the SMB M apply equally across genders among adult workers. Four hypotheses were formulated: First, we expected that women would show higher burnout scores than men ( 44, 50, 57). Second, we expected that adequate internal consistency would be found for the SMB M in both populations and both male and female. More specifically, we expected that all inter-item correlations would be 0.20. We also expected that Cronbach's alpha values would be 0.70. Finally, we expected that item-total correlations would be 0.30 ( 23, 24, 32). Third, we expected to find adequate convergent validity in male and female participants and across both study populations. That is, we hypothesized that the SMBM subscales and the SMBM overall index would be moderately to strongly correlated with perceived stress (positive correlation) (44, 45, 48). Fourth, with regard to factorial validity, we expected that a three-factor model would produce adequate model fit (23, 24 ) and that both a first- and second-order model would fit well with the empirical data ( 24). In line with previous research ( 23, 24), we expected good factor loadings (0.55) across all items on the corresponding factors [see Ref. ( 60)] and at least weak measurement invariance across genders (more information regarding types of measurement invariance is provided in the Materials and Methods section). MATERIALS AND METHODS Sample 1: Adult Workers Participants and Procedures The first study population was composed of adult workers who were recruited via exercise and health science students (N = 87) of the University of Basel, who took part in an introductory course in research methodology. Every student was asked to provide the names and email addresses of 6-12 people (no relatives) who would be willing to take part in an online survey. In order to obtain a broad sample, each student was asked to provide the names of a total of 12 persons from a variety of professional groups: a) Psychometric Properties and Convergent Validity of the SMB M Schilling et al. 4 August 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 536 Frontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.orgwith vocational education and training working in the primary (farming, forestry, hunting, mining, fishing) or secondary sectors (industry, construction industry), b) without higher education working in the tertiary sector (trade, transport, warehousing, hospitality, gastronomy, services), and c) with higher education working in the tertiary sector. For each of the three categories, students had to list one male and female person, and one person younger and one person older than 50 years. In total, the students suggested 756 potential participants (407 men, 349 women; on average 8.7 suggestions per student). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, and the local ethics committee approved the study (EKNZ: 240/12). After two reminders, 311 adult workers completed the online survey (41.1% response rate). Burnout To measure symptoms of burnout, the participants answered the SMB M (32), which consists of 14 items that have been described in detail in the introduction section. The German version was downloaded from the homepage of Arie Shirom ( www.shirom. org/arie/index.html ; see Supplementary online material ). Perceived Stress We employed the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) ( 61) to measure participants' levels of perceived stress. The PSS consists of 10 items and assesses stress during the past month. Participants report the frequency with which they find their lives unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overwhelming (e.g., \"During the last month, how often have you been upset because of something that happened unexpectedly?, \" \"During the last month, how often have you felt that things were going your way?\"). Answering options ranged from 1 (never) to 5 (very often). Higher scores are indicative of more pronounced subjective stress perceptions. The PSS proved to be a reliable und valid instrument in previous research ( 62, 63). In our population, we found a Cronbach's alpha of = 0.75. Occupational Stress We used the 11-item Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ) to assess an imbalance between demands and control at work ( 64). To assess job-related demands, participants answered five items on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (never) to 4 (often). For instance, we asked participants whether their job requirements include very fast or hard work or whether they have to accomplish large amounts of work. A sample item is: \"My job requires me to work very hard. \" In addition, participants completed six items to assess their perceived level of control at work. A sample item is: \"I have freedom to make decisions about my job. \" For each domain, we calculated a subscale score by summing up the values of each item, with higher scores being indicative of higher demands or control at work. We used the following formula to obtain the JDC ratio: job demand/(job control \u00d7 0.8333). In addition, we used the 16 items from the Effort-Reward Imbalance (ERI) questionnaire to assess job-related effort and reward ( 65). We assessed effort at work with five items and reward with 11 items, all of which were anchored on a 5-point Likert-scale. Items were completed in a two-step process. Participants first indicated whether they agreed or disagreed with the item content, describing a typical experience of their work situation. Items were scored 1 if participants did not experience a specific type of situation. If they did experience this type of situation, participants indicated how stressful each experience usually is for them, with response options ranging from 2 (not distressing) to 5 (very distressing). Sample items for the effort scale are: \"I have a lot of responsibility in my job\" or \"I have many interruptions and disturbances in my job. \" Sample items for the reward scale are: \"I receive the respect I deserve from my superior or a similarly relevant person. \" or \"Considering all my efforts and achievements, my job promotion prospects are adequate. \" Items were summed to obtain subscale scores for the effort and reward domains, with higher scores reflecting higher effort or reward. Because of the unequal number of items, we used the following formula to generate the ERI ratio: effort/ (reward \u00d7 0.4545). Evidence for the validity and reliability of this instrument has been presented previously ( 65). Depressive Symptoms We applied the Depression subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to measure self-perceived depressive symptoms ( 66). The depression subscale of the HADS consists of seven items, asking participants about mood changes that may occur during the course of depression (e.g., \"I still enjoy the things I used to enjoy. \"). This instrument was originally designed for nonpsychiatric populations. Answers were given on a Likert-scale with four response options, from 0 (never) to 4 (almost always). Previous investigations have shown that the HADS has good psychometric properties and can be considered a valid tool to assess depressive symptoms. Items were summed to obtain an overall index, with higher scores being indicative of higher depressive symptoms. The Cronbach's alpha was = 0.71 in our population. Statistical Analyses Univariate analyses of variance (ANOV A) were used to examine gender differences. Correlational analyses were used to examine homogeneity and total correlations of all items. Internal consistency was measured with Cronbach's alpha coefficient. Correlations were employed to test convergent validity. Finally, factorial validity was tested by means of CFA. Our expectation was that the 14 items would load on three different factors (six items on physical exhaustion, five items on cognitive weariness, and three items on emotional exhaustion). Accordingly, our three-factor model contained at total of 14 observed variables that were linked to three latent constructs. Maximum likelihood (ML) was applied to estimate the parameters. Moreover, we inspected multiple fit indexes to judge the fit between the empirical data and the theoretical model data ( 67). Simultaneous multiple group comparisons were used to test invariance of the measurement model across gender. As recommended by Byrne ( 68), good model fit is achieved if the normed fit index (NFI) is 0.95, the comparative fit index (CFI) is 0.95, the Tucker Lewis Index (TLI) is 0.95, and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) is 0.05. As recommended by Comrey and Lee ( 60), standardized factor loadings should be interpreted as follows: 0.71 = excellent, 0.63 = very good, 0.55 = good, 0.45 = fair, and >0.32 = poor. CFA are performed with AMOS\u00ae 24 (IBM Corporation, Armonk NY , USA), all other analyses with SPSS\u00ae 22 (IBM Corporation, Armonk NY , USA). We compared the default model against a model which assumed Psychometric Properties and Convergent Validity of the SMBM Schilling et al. 5 August 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 536 Frontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.orgconfigural (same pattern of fixed and free factor loadings across gender), weak (invariant factor loadings across gender), strong (invariant factor loadings and intercepts across gender), and strict (invariant factor loadings, intercepts, and unique factor variances across gender) measurement invariance in order to test measurement invariance across gender ( 69). We used 2 to examine the fit of different models, with nonsignificant 2-test scores indicating that the more restricted model fitted better with the empirical data. RESULTS Sample 1 was composed of 161 male and 150 female participants. The mean age was M = 42.64 years (SD = 14.02; range, 19-67 years). Participants reported a mean job experience of M = 21.61 years (SD = 13.95; range, 1-47 years). All participants were employed for at least 50% ( M = 88.01%; SD = 17.87; range, 50-100%), with 60.1% in full time employment. The sample had a mean body mass index (BMI) (height in cm/body weight in kg 2) of M = 23.87 (SD = 3.6), with 33.40% of the sample (n = 104) being classified as overweight (BMI 25). Moreover, 40.5% ( n = 126) reported that they have children living at home, 1.9% ( n = 6) had responsibility as a caregiver for a person in need of care, and 8.4% ( n = 26) reported shift work. With regard to participants' highest level of education, one person (0.3%) finished compulsory school without additional training, 42.5% (n = 132) completed vocational education and training, 9.6% ( n = 30) completed academic high school, and 47.6% (n = 148) completed higher education. Finally, 14.5% ( n = 45) reported that they are smokers, whereas 1.9% (n = 6) reported taking antidepressant medication. In sample 1, we found a mean score of the SMB M overall index of 2.42 ( SD = 1.00) ( Table 1 ). In total, 5.8% ( n = 18) of the participants had a burnout score that can be deemed clinically relevant (4.40). We did not find significant gender differences with respect to any of the SMB M overall index and subscales (Table 1 ). A 2-test showed that a similar portion of women ( n = 9, 6.0%) and men ( n = 9, 5.6%) reported clinically relevant burnout symptoms, 2(1) = 0.03, p = ns. For the three SMB M subscales, the inter-item correlations were all above 0.20. Moreover, item-total correlations were all above the critical threshold of 0.40. In our sample, all Cronbach's alpha values were satisfactory (physical exhaustion = 0.92, cognitive weariness = 0.95, emotional exhaustion = 0.90, SMB M overall index = 0.95). Regarding convergent validity ( Table 2 ), we found a positive correlation between the SMBM overall index and the PSS sum score (r = 0.56, p < 0.001). If compared to the emotional exhaustion subscale (r = 0.35, p < 0.001), we found stronger associations between the PSS sum score and the physical exhaustion (r = 0.54, p < 0.001) and cognitive weariness subscales ( r = 0.49, p < 0.001). The SMB M indices were also moderately and positively TABLE 1 | Descriptive statistics for the two samples, test of gender differences, and bivariate correlations between the Shirom-Melamed Burnout Measure (SMBM) subscales and the overall SMBM index.

Regarding factorial validity, we found a satisfactory model fit for the three-factor model for the first- and second-order model ( Table 3 ). Configural and weak measurement invariance (invariant factor loadings) was supported across genders. The second-order model even supported strict measurement invariance. Factor loadings were very good (with all loadings being 0.63). The measurement coefficients for the three-factor models are displayed in Figure 1 , both for female and male participants. We also found relatively strong associations between the SMB M subscales in the first-order model ( r = 0.51-0.76, p < 0.001).Sample 2: Police Officers Participants and Procedures Sample 2 consisted of 201 police officers who were recruited from a police force in a bigger city in the Northwestern, German- speaking part of Switzerland. All officers ( N = 980, 290 female, 690 male) were invited to participate in a comprehensive health check [including a cardiorespiratory fitness test, 7-day actigraphy, smartphone-based 2-day assessment of work-related affect and stressors, anthropometry, measurement of fasting blood lipid and blood glucose, blood pressure assessment, a computerized cognitive test (facial emotion recognition), a functional movement screen, a lung function test, and an online survey focusing on stress and mental health].

Detailed information was given to all interested officers (e.g., about the voluntary basis of participation, no negative consequences in case of nonparticipation, information about benefits and risk, information about measurements). Out of all 980 information recipients, 201 participated in the study (20.5% response rate). Data were assessed between December 2017 and April 2018. A personalized health profile was given to the officers after the completion of the data assessment as an incentive for participation. Moreover, all officers had the opportunity to participate in a voluntary lifestyle coaching. All participants provided written informed consent before data assessment. All procedures were in line with the ethical principles described in the Helsinki Declaration, and approval was obtained for the study by the local ethics committee (EKNZ: Project-ID: 2017-01477).

Perceived Stress As with sample 1 (adult workers), police officers' self-perceived levels of stress were assessed with the four-item PSS. Occupational Stress As for sample 1, occupational stress was assessed with the 11-item Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ) and the 16-item Effort-Reward Imbalance (ERI) questionnaire. Overall Mental Distress To assess overall mental distress, all officers filled in the German version of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) ( 70; 71). Participants were asked to rate their mental well-being, with reference to the previous week. Response options on a 4-point Likert scale ranged from 0 (not at all) to 3 (much more than usual). A sum score was calculated (from 0 to 36), with higher scores being reflective of higher levels of mental distress. Although no standard clinical cut-offs exist for the GHQ-12, researchers have used the following categories to successfully establish links between the GHQ-12 and mortality (if response options 0 + 1 = 0, and 2 + 3 = 1): asymptomatic (0), subclinically symptomatic (1-3), symptomatic (4-6), and highly symptomatic (7-12) ( 72, 73). Statistical Analyses We performed the same statistical analyses as with sample 1. RESULTS Sample 2 was composed of 72 female and 129 male participants. The mean age was M = 38.55 years ( SD = 10.13; range, 22-62 years). Participants reported a mean job experience of M = 12.77 years ( SD = 8.8; range, 0-37 years). All participants were employed for at least 30% ( M = 92.08%; SD = 18.21; range, 30-100%), with 79.6% having a full-time employment. The sample had a mean body mass index (height in cm/body weight in kg2) of M = 25.77 ( SD = 3.63), with 52.7% of the sample (n = 106) being classified as overweight (BMI 25). Moreover, 43.3% ( n = 87) reported that they have children living at home, 3.0% ( n = 6) had responsibility as a caregiver for a person in need of care, and 48.3% ( n = 97) reported shift work. With regard to participants' highest level of education, 2.0% ( n = 4) finished compulsory school without additional training, 50.7% (n = 102) completed vocational education and training, 7.5% (n = 15) completed an academic high school, and 39.8% ( n = 80) completed higher education. Finally, 18.4% ( n = 37) reported that they are smokers, whereas 10.0% ( n = 20) reported taking antidepressant medication. In the total sample, we found a score for the SMB M overall index of 2.51 ( SD = 0.99) ( Table 1 ). Moreover, 5% ( n = 9) of the participants had burnout levels above the cut-off for clinically relevant burnout symptoms (4.40). In comparison to male participants, female officers scored higher with regard to physical exhaustion (women: M = 3.15, SD = 1.30; men: M = 2.66, SD = 1.19) and the overall SMB M index (women: M = 2.70, SD = 1.00; men: M = 2.40, SD = 0.96). The distribution of men ( n = 6, 4.7%) and women ( n = 3, 4.2%) was similarly among those participants above the cut-off for clinically relevant burnout symptoms, 2(1) = 0.03, p = ns. The inter-item correlations exceeded the critical value of 0.20, and all item-total correlations were above the threshold of 0.40, for each of the three SMB M subscales. The Cronbach's alpha values were satisfactory across all SMBM indices (physical exhaustion = 0.92, cognitive weariness = 0.95, emotional exhaustion = 0.90, SMBM overall index = 0.95). With respect to convergent validity ( Table 2 ), we observed positive associations between the SMB M (subscales and overall index), self-perceived stress ( r = 0.42-0.59), the ERI ratio ( r = 0.14-0.31), and the JDC ratio ( r = 0.12-0.32). Only a statistically nonsignificant trend towards a positive relationship was found between emotional exhaustion and the ERI/JDC ratios. Finally, overall mental distress was positively associated with all SMBM indices ( r = 0.43-0.62, p < 0.001). A good model fit was found for the three-factor CFA model. Moreover, both the first- and second-order model were supported (Table 3 ). Evidence for weak measurement invariance (invariant factor loadings) across genders was supported. As shown in Figure 1 , very good factor loadings were observed across all items (all loadings 0.63), both for women and men. With regard to the first-order model, the three SMB M subscales were strongly correlated with each other ( r = 0.55-0.63, p < 0.001). DISCUSSION The present studies show that the German version of the SMB M has adequate psychometric properties and acceptable convergent validity and can therefore be used in burnout research in various samples of adult workers. Moreover, the factor structure of the SMB M was supported in CFA and found to be gender invariant. This work expands the current literature in an important way in that we, for the first time, thoroughly examined the validity of the SMBM among adult workers and examined whether the instrument performs equally well in male and female participants. Given that the SMBM is among the most widely used instruments to assess burnout symptoms, such an analysis seemed highly warranted. Based on the study aims, four hypotheses were formulated; below, each hypothesis is discussed in detail. With the first hypothesis we expected that, compared to male participants, female participants would report higher burnout symptoms, and data from police officers confirmed this. However, contrary to our hypothesis, no gender differences were found in the broader sample of adult workers, which is at odds with prior research in adult populations ( 50, 57). How to explain this unexpected pattern of results? While in our adult sample, no gender difference existed with regard to age, BMI, Psychometric Properties and Convergent Validity of the SMB M Schilling et al. 9 August 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 536 Frontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.orgmarital status, children at home, caregiving, job experience, educational level, smoking status, and use of medication, we found that men had a higher mean employment rate than women (96.2% vs. 78.84% in full-time employment). Therefore, it can be speculated that the lack of gender differences might be attributed to lower employment rates among women. However, a higher full-time employment rate was also found among male (90%) compared to female (56%) participants in our sample of police officers. An alternative explanation might be that burnout levels were generally low in the sample of adult workers, with only 5.8% reporting clinically relevant burnout symptoms ( 46). However, we acknowledge that generally low burnout levels were also observed in our sample of police officers. With regard to the low burnout levels, we argue that the recruitment strategies to address adult workers and police officers might have led to a selection bias in the sense that students more often contacted healthy people, and/or that healthy people were more willing to participate in the study. Finally, in line with previous studies ( 24, 57), higher subscale mean scores were found for physical fatigue in both samples and genders if compared to cognitive weariness and emotional exhaustion. With the second hypothesis, we expected that internal consistency of the SMB M would be satisfactory in both adult workers and police officers and both women and men ( 23, 24, 32), and generally, our data confirmed this. Thus, all Cronbach's alpha coefficients exceeded 0.70, for all SMB M indices, in both male and female participants, and across both samples. Moreover, we found inter-item correlations of 0.20 within the respective factor for both male and female participants. All item- total correlations exceeded the critical value of 0.40. Finally, according to the standards recommended by West et al. ( 74), we observed that the descriptive statistics met the prerequisites for parametric tests, with skewness being <2 and kurtosis being <7 across all SMB M indices. With the third hypothesis we expected to find evidence for the convergent validity of the SMB M in both male and female participants. Full support was found for this hypothesis. In accordance with previous studies ( 52, 50, 55), the SMB M overall index was at least moderately and positively associated with participants' levels of perceived stress. In our two populations, we also found weak-to-moderate (positive) correlations between the SMB M indices and occupational stress, which accords well with previous research in this area ( 75-77). The observation that stronger correlations were found for the PSS can be explained by the fact that the PSS is a general measure of stress, whereas the ERI and JDC ratios assess specific forms of occupational stress that might not be applicable for some participants. Moreover, our results corroborate prior research, in which at least moderate correlations were observed between the SMB M overall index and mental health outcomes such as depressive symptoms (44, 45, 48). The correlations were moderate-to-strong in both populations, with slightly higher correlations found in police officers. However, these differences are difficult to interpret because we used different instruments to assess mental health in each sample. In the adult worker sample, our findings suggest that the SMB M overall index and depressive symptoms have 26.0% (women) and 30.3% (men) of common variance. As highlighted by Melamed et al. ( 27), it can be expected that burnout and depressive symptoms have a certain overlap because they share some characteristic features such as fatigue and loss of energy. Support was also found for our fourth and final hypothesis, that the three-factorial model would fit well with the empirical data: The findings of our studies indicate that a three-factor model provided an excellent model fit across all samples, with all factor loadings being strongly linked to the respective factors ( 24). The first-order model showed that the latent factors were moderately to highly correlated with each other ( r = 0.51-0.76, p [cp. 23, 57)]. Shirom and ( 19), this magnitude of correlations between the SMB M subscales is to be expected because every individual possesses a pool of energetic resources. These resources are closely interrelated, and a deficit in one resource can lead to deficits in other resources. Moreover, in line with a previous study with Canadian workers ( 24), our findings support the factorial validity of a second-order model. This lends further support to the notion that it is legitimate to use the SMB M overall score as a global/general burnout index. Sassi and Neveu ( 24) found that overall burnout explained 63, 53, and 27% of variance in physical exhaustion, cognitive weariness, and emotional exhaustion, respectively, which was comparable to the findings reported in our analyses (physical exhaustion, 56-64%; cognitive weariness, 62-79%; emotional exhaustion, 33-50%). The fact that an adequate model fit was found for the second- order model indicates that the items of the SMB M subscales can be aggregated to form an overall burnout index. Finally, for the first time, our results provide evidence for weak-to-strict measurement invariance across male and female workers. This is an important finding because Widaman et al. ( 69) argued that, if participants' answers vary so much as a function of gender that significant differences emerge in the factor structure of that instrument, the measuring device must change. The same would be the case for relevant ceiling or floor effects occurring for male and female participants. Thus, the present analyses suggest that the SMB M is equally suitable to assess burnout symptoms independent of participants' gender. Despite the novelty of our study, some methodological shortcomings should be mentioned that might limit the generalizability of our data: First, the cross-sectional nature of our studies did not allow us to examine test-retest reliability and predictive validity. Second, the correlations reported in the present samples were not controlled for other demographic factors, although previous studies have shown that participants with elevated burnout are more often divorced, blue-collar workers, have lower education levels, are foreigners, unemployed, financially strained, use more medication, and report less healthy behaviors ( 50, 52, 54). Third, both samples consisted of nonclinical populations. Therefore, it was not possible to examine the discriminant validity of the SMB M, particularly as the number of participants with clinically relevant burnout levels was low in the present study. Accordingly, we were unable to test the discriminant validity of the cut-off for clinically relevant burnout (4.40), which Lundgren-Nilsson et al. ( 20) previously suggested for the SMB Q. This is an important shortcoming that should be addressed in future research. Fourth, while for study 1, we attempted to recruit a sample of adult workers that is broad Psychometric Properties and Convergent Validity of the SMB M Schilling et al. 10 August 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 536 Frontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.orgin terms of employment, education, age, and gender, we did not assess specific information about the participants' occupations. Thus, we were not able to examine whether the described relationships differ according to varying professions. Finally, we acknowledge that there are other validated instruments to assess burnout symptoms in German-speaking (and international) populations. One such instrument is the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI) ( 78-80), in which burnout symptoms are operationalized via two dimensions (exhaustion, disengagement from work). As it applies for the SMBM (14 items, based on COR theory), it is a particular strength of the OLBI that the instrument is concise (16 items) and that it has been developed based on a solid theoretical foundation (Job Demands-Resources model of burnout). We therefore suggest that this instrument could be used in future research to test the discriminant validity of the SMB M. Specifically, we would expect that the SMB M scales are more strongly correlated with the exhaustion than the disengagement from work subscale of the OLBI. A strong correlation can be expected with the exhaustion subscale because, as in the SMB M, the OLBI assesses affective, cognitive, and physical aspects of exhaustion. CONCLUSIONS AND PRACTICAL RELEVANCE The SMB M is among the most widely used tools in international burnout research. Our study shows, for the first time, that the German version of the instrument has adequate psychometric properties and satisfactory convergent and factorial validity in a broad sample of adult workers and police officers. The SMB M can provide relevant information for screening and treatment planning. More research is needed to establish the validity of the cut-off score for clinically relevant burnout. This is essential for finding out whether the SMB M can be used in the early screening process to identify employees who might suffer from clinically significant burnout symptoms.

Creating less stressful work environments and making employees physically and psychologically more resilient against stress are therefore two major public health concerns. This study examined whether cardiorespiratory tness moderated the association between occupational stress, cardiovascular risk, and mental health. Methods: Stress was assessed via the E ort-Reward Imbalance and Job Demand-Control models in 201 police o \u000ecers (36% women, Mage =38.6 years). Higher levels of blood pressure, blood lipids, blood sugar, and unfavorable body composition were considered as cardiovascular risk factors. Burnout, insomnia and overall psychological distress were used as mental health indicators. Cardiorespiratory tness was assessed with a submaximal bicycle test. Results: High cardiorespiratory tness levels were associated with a reduced cardiometabolic risk, whereas high stress levels were associated with better mental health. Among participants who perceived a high E ort-Reward Imbalance, those with high tness levels showed lower overall cardiovascular risk scores than their colleagues with low tness levels. Conclusions: Work health programs for police o \u000ecers should consider the early screening of burnout, sleep disturbances, and overall mental wellbeing. To increase cardiovascular health, including tness tests in routine health checks and promoting physical activity to further increase cardiorespiratory tness appears worthwhile. police o \u000ecers; mental health 1. Introduction Prolonged exposure to stressful life circumstances that exceed individuals' coping capacities can result in emotional, cognitive, physiological and somatic health impairments [ 1]. While most individuals are able to handle short-term stress, chronic stress can have severe health consequences [ 2]. Studies show that high levels of psychosocial stress are a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), with an impact comparable to smoking or diabetes, and that a dose-response relationship exists between psychosocial stress and premature death [3,4]. Adverse work conditions constitute a major source of distress for many adults [ 5]. Despite multiple e orts during the past decade, work-related stress has not substantially decreased in European countries [ 6]. Accordingly, costs associated with occupational stress (e.g., due to health Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019 ,16, 2349; doi:10.3390 /ijerph16132349 www.mdpi.com /ijerphInt. J. Environ. Res. Public 2019 ,16, 2349 2 of 19 care, absenteeism, presenteeism, reduced productivity, increased turnover) remain high, and can be estimated at 0.5 to 1.2% of the gross domestic product (GDP) [7]. In the occupational stress literature, two of the most prominent theoretical models are the job demands-control (JDC) model [ 8] and the effort-reward imbalance (ERI) model [ 9]. Broadly speaking, the JDC model assumes that stress occurs when workers perceive a discrepancy between the demands they face at work and their ability to control those requirements with their existing resources. In the JDC model, such an imbalance is labelled as \"job strain\". By contrast, the ERI model assumes that employees perceive their work as stressful, if they have the feeling that they invest a lot of energy (efforts), but do not get enough recognition (reward) for their efforts. Empirical evidence supports the validity of both models showing that an imbalance between demands /control and efforts /reward is associated with an increased risk for impaired mental wellbeing (e.g., burnout, anxiety, impaired sleep quality), decreased physical health (e.g., coronary heart disease, musculoskeletal disease), and premature death [10,11]. According to the World Health Organization [ 12], CVDs are the leading cause of deaths worldwide. In their review of prospective epidemiologic studies, Siegrist and Dragano [11] highlighted that high job strain doubles the risk for CVDs, particularly among men. Similarly, Nyberg et al. [ 13] found in a meta-analytic survey that work-related stress was linked to an increased risk for CVDs, mainly due to an elevated risk for type II diabetes, smoking, and physical inactivity. In line with this notion, the American Heart Association provided recommendations on the most relevant factors to maintain cardiovascular health [ 14]. These include: body mass index <25;\u001530 min of moderate intensity physical activity per day; <200 mg /dL of and\u0014100 mg /dL fasting blood glucose [ 14]. As highlighted by Mottillo et al. [ 15], if individuals fail to meet several of these recommendations, their risk of all-cause mortality substantially increases. Additionally, ample evidence exists for a close link between occupational stress and decreased mental wellbeing [ 16]. In high-income countries, the social burden of mental disorders is high, with costs estimated at 2.3 to 4.4% of the GDP [ 17]. Based on their review of prospective epidemiologic studies, Siegrist and Dragano [ 11] concluded that high occupational stress (as measured via a JDC or ERI imbalance) is associated with a 1.2 to 4.6-fold increased risk for depression. Additionally, occupational stress has been described to be the most important cause of burnout among adult workers [18], and seems to be closely associated with sleep complaints [19]. In the present study, we specically focused on the occupation of law enforcement. Policing has often been described as a particularly (emotionally) stressful occupation [ 20,21]. In their professional lives, police o \u000ecers have to deal with death, su ering, poverty, and physical threats; consequently, they are frequently required to draw on their physical and mental resources [ 22]. As emphasized by Waters et al. [ 23], some police o \u000ecers start their career healthy, but develop severe health issues if the cumulative impact of stress becomes too big and takes its toll. Habersaat et al. [ 24] point out that police o \u000ecers are a heterogeneous population, and that their health risk seems to depend more on individual perceptions of their work conditions than on characteristics of the division-specic work environment. This is in line with study ndings reported by Gerber et al. [ 20], who observed that o \u000ecers' mental health is more closely related to their subjective stress perception than their shift work status, a factor associated with ill-health in other studies [ 25]. While ample evidence exists showing that chronic stress exposure contributes to both mental [ 26] and physical health issues [ 27,28], research is equivocal regarding the question of whether police o \u000ecers are more at-risk for impaired health than other professions. For instance, previous research has shown that in the United States, many police o \u000ecers have below-average tness levels [ 29], and are more likely to be obese, to su er from metabolic syndrome and to have higher total cholesterol levels than the general population [ 30]. By contrast, van der Velden et al. [ 31] reported that although policing is generally considered as a high-risk profession, no evidence exists to suggest that Dutch police o \u000ecers are more likely to develop mental health disturbances than employees of banks, supermarkets, and psychiatric hospitals. Given the negative health consequences associated with chronic occupational stress in both police o\u000ecers and other professions [ 10,32], creating less stressful work environments and nding ways toInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019 ,16, 2349 3 of 19 make employees more resilient against stress are two major public health concerns [ 33,34]. Since the early 1980s, researchers have discussed whether participation in regular physical activity or having su\u000eciently high tness levels might protect employees from the health hazards associated with chronic occupational stress [ 35]. While such \"stress-bu ering\" e ects of physical activity and physical tness are supported in the literature [ 36], few studies have focussed on occupational stress. Among the existing studies, researchers often failed to use theory-based instruments to assess stress [ 37,38], focussed on physical demands at work instead of psychological strain [39], and relied on self-reports (instead of objective measures) to assess physical activity or physical tness [ 40-43]. While the existing studies generally support the notion of physical activity /tness as a stress-bu er, it must also be noted that few studies used objective measures to assess health. Nevertheless, in a 30-year follow-up study, Holtermann et al. [ 39] found that participants with high work demands had a higher risk of ischaemic heart disease and all-cause mortality, if compared to participants with low physical work demands. However, this only applied to men with low tness levels, whereas no such relationship was found among men with high tness. Similarly, Gerber et al. [ 37] reported that employees with high scores on a simple 1-item stress questionnaire had a higher total metabolic risk as compared to counterparts with lower stress levels. Again, this relationship was only observed among employees with low tness levels, whereas no association between occupational stress and cardiometabolic risk occurred among employees with moderate or high tness levels. Finally, Schmidt et al. [ 44] reported that employees with high scores on a maximal tness test were less likely to be a ected by high job-related self-control demands. Given this background, the purpose of the present study was to nd out whether cardiorespiratory tness levels moderated the relationship between occupational stress, cardiovascular and mental health outcomes. The present study goes beyond existing research in several ways: First, we used the two most established models (JDC /ERI) to assess occupational stress. Second, contrary to previous studies, in which researchers often used self-reported physical activity as an easily measurable proxy for physical tness, we used an established submaximal tness test to estimate participants' maximal oxygen uptake. Third, contrary to most previous studies, we included objective physical health markers in order to nd out whether the stress-bu ering e ects of physical tness could be generalized beyond subjective health complaints and symptoms of mental ill-health. Based on the literature presented above, we formulated three hypotheses: \u000f Our rst hypothesis was that higher levels of occupational stress will be associated with an increased cardiovascular risk, and more frequent mental health complaints, independent of the model used to operationalize occupational stress. \u000f Our second hypothesis was that higher levels of cardiorespiratory tness will be associated with a lower cardiovascular risk, and fewer mental health complaints. \u000f Our third hypothesis was that cardiorespiratory tness will moderate the relationship between occupational stress and physical /mental health indicators: Thus, the relationship will become smaller as a function of increasing tness levels, independent on whether occupational stress is operationalized via the JDC or ERI model. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Participants and Procedures Participants were recruited from a police force in Basel, a bigger city in the northwestern, German-speaking part of Switzerland. All o \u000ecers ( N=980, 290 females, 690 males) were invited to participate in the study, consisting of a comprehensive health check, including a cardiorespiratory tness test, 7-day actigraphy, anthropometry, blood pressure assessment, a computerised cognitive test (facial emotion recognition), a functional movement screen, a lung function test, and an online-survey focusing on stress and mental health. Di erent channels were used to advertise the study including emails via intranet, video clips on the internal TV channel, printed flyers, and oral information duringInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019 ,16, 2349 4 of 19 team meetings. For interested o \u000ecers, more specic information (e.g., regarding the voluntary nature of participation, no negative consequences in case of non-participation, information about benets and risk, information about measurements) was provided via short text modules and video messages via an e-learning tool. Data assessment took place between October 2017 and March 2018. As an incentive, each participant received a personalized health prole after the completion of the data assessment. Moreover, participants had the possibility to take part in a voluntary lifestyle coaching program. No specic inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. However, to be allowed to take part in the cardiorespiratory tness test, participants were asked to sign the written informed consent and ll in an extended version of the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q) [ 45]. Thus, workers were not allowed to perform the cardiorespiratory tness test, if they reported any conditions that prevent participation in a submaximal tness test, as dened by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) [ 45]. In case of uncertainty, participants were asked to consult a general practitioner (and provide a doctor's certicate). Furthermore, participants were only allowed to perform the cardiorespiratory tness test if they did not report a temporary illness such as a cold or a fewer. If participants were not able /allowed to take part in the cardiorespiratory tness test, they still could perform all other tests. The data assessment took place during o \u000ecial working hours. The 120-min laboratory testing was carried out at the education and training center of the police force, and all tests were performed in a private setting in a specic room reserved across the entire study period by the same investigator. The regional ethical review board (EKNZ: Project-ID: 2017-01477) approved the study, which was performed in accordance with the ethical principles laid down in the current edition of the Deceleration of Helsinki. 2.2. Measures 2.2.1. Occupational Stress Two di erent scales were used to assess work-related stress, referring to the two most widely used job-related stress theories [ 46], the Job Demand and Control (JDC) [ 47] and the E ort-Reward Imbalance (ERI) model [ 48]. The demand scale from the JDC model contains ve items on a 4-point Likert-scale ranging from 1 (never) to 4 (often). For example, participants were asked whether their job requires them to work very fast, hard, or to accomplish large amounts of work. Participants also completed six items on the subscale pertaining to control (e.g., 'I have freedom to make decisions about my job'). The items were summed to obtain subscale scores for job demand and job control. Because of the unequal number of items the JDC-ratio was calculated with the following formula: job demand /(job control \u00020.8333). Values >1 of the JDC-ratio indicated stress with possible adverse health e ects [ 49]. The validity and reliability of this instrument has been established previously [ 50]. The e ort scale of the ERI model consists of ve items anchored on a 5-point Likert-scale from 1 (none) to 5 (very high). Sample items were: 'I have a lot of responsibility in my job' or 'I have many interruptions and disturbances in my job.' The reward scale consists of 11 items with the same semantic anchors (e.g., 'I receive the respect I deserve from my superior or a respective relevant person.' or 'Considering all my e orts and achievements, my job promotion prospects are adequate.'). The ERI-ratio was calculated with the following formula: e ort/(reward \u00020.4545). This measure has previously proven to be valid and reliable [51]. ERI-ratio scores above 1 reflect higher levels of job stress [48]. 2.2.2. Cardiovascular Risk Markers Blood pressure, height, weight, waist circumference, body composition, blood lipids and blood glucose were assessed as cardiovascular risk markers. Blood pressure was measured with a portable device (OMRON M500, OMRON Healthcare Co. Ltd. 53, Kunotsubo, Terado-cho, Muko, Kyoto 617-0002 Japan), which was attached to the left arm. Two measurements were taken with approximately one minute's break in between. The mean of the two measurements was usedInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019 ,16, 2349 5 of 19 for further analyses [ 52]. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were used as outcome measures. Height was measured to the nearest ve mm using a stationary stadiometer. Weight and body composition were assessed with a wireless body composition monitor (BC-500, Tanita Corp., Tokyo, Japan). The participants were asked to fast three hours before the data assessment, to not take part in exhausting sport activities 24 h prior to the testing, to void their bladder prior to the data assessment, and to wear only light sport clothing ( \u00141 kg). The instrument assessed the participants' weight to the nearest ten g, which was corrected for clothes (minus one kg). The Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated (weight (kg) * height (m)\u00002) as an outcome variable. Moreover, body fat was assessed as an outcome variable. Blood lipids and blood glucose were assessed via nger prick, and instantly analyzed using the Alere Anion AS100 (Abbott Diagnostics, Alere Technologies, Rodel\u00f8kka NO-0504 Oslo, Norway). Alere lipid and glucose panel controls were used to ensure the reliability of the analyzers. Two drops of blood were needed to assess blood glucose (HbA1c), total cholesterol (TC), high-density (TG). Capillary blood sampling is a frequently used minimal invasive and minimal painful method, and is regarded as being quicker and less distressing than venipuncture [ 53]. The nger prick was performed following the standardization protocol of the World Health Organization (WHO) [ 53], in order to maintain good clinical utility and high accuracy [ 52,54]. The validity and reliability of the applied instruments and procedures have been documented in previous research [55-57]. 2.2.3. Mental Health We used the Shirom-Melamed Burnout Measure (SMBM) to assess occupational burnout symptoms [ 58]. The SMBM is a validated and widely used tool that comprises 14 items with response options on a 7-point Likert scale from one (almost never), to seven (almost always). The items can be assigned to three dimensions: six items refer to the aspects of physical fatigue, ve items to cognitive weariness, and three items refer to emotional exhaustion. The mean score is built to obtain an overall burnout index, with values of \u00154.40 being considered as clinically relevant [ 59]. Subjective sleep complaints were assessed with the brief 7-item self-report Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) [ 60]. Referring to the last month, participants state their di \u000eculties falling asleep, di \u000eculties maintaining sleep, early morning awakenings, daytime fatigue, daytime performance, satisfaction with sleep, and worrying about sleep. Answers were given on a 5-point Likert scale, scored from 0 (e.g., no problem at all) to 4 (e.g., very severe problem), yielding a total of 0 to 28, with higher scores being indicative of more frequent sleep complaints. Scores should be interpreted as Adequate measurement properties have been shown previously [ 62]. The German version of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) was used to assess mental distress or minor psychiatric morbidities [ 61,63]. The GHQ-12 has been frequently used in the literature and its validity and reliability have been extensively reviewed [ 63]. Participants self-report their mental well-being during the previous week. Answers can be given on a 4-point Likert scale ranging with response options being 0 (not at all), 1 (same as usual), 2 (more than usual), and 3 (much more than usual). Sum scores range from 0 to 36, with higher scores reflecting higher levels of mental distress. Currently, no standard cut-o values exist for dividing up \"cases\" identied by a GHQ-12 score threshold. However, researchers have used the following categories to successfully establish links between the GHQ-12 and mortality (if response options 0 +1=0, and 2 +3=1): asymptomatic (0), subclinically symptomatic (1-3), symptomatic (4-6), highly symptomatic (7-12) [ 4,64]. In the present sample, internal consistency was acceptable across all mental health indicators. Cronbach's alphas were 0.94 for burnout symptoms, 0.74 for sleep complaints, and 0.87 for mental distress. 2.2.4. Cardiorespiratory Fitness Cardiorespiratory tness was tested with the \u00c5strand Fitness Test, a submaximal test performed on a bicycle ergometer [ 65]. Based on participants' heart rate, maximal oxygen consumption (VO 2max ),Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019 ,16, 2349 6 of 19 which is a measure of cardiorespiratory tness, was estimated indirectly [ 66]. Participants were instructed to avoid any strenuous activity for 24 h prior to the testing, as well as heavy meals, ca eine, or nicotine for three hours before the testing. Before starting the test, participants were equipped with a heart rate monitor. For men, the test protocol was standardized at a workload of 150 watts, for women at 100 watts. The workload was adjusted so that the heart rate is kept between 130 beats per minute (bpm) and 160 bpm, and between 120 bpm and 150 bpm in participants from the age of 40. The subjects were asked to cycle at a pace of 60 rotations per minute (rpm) for six minutes. At the end of each minute, the subject's heart rate was noted. After two minutes, the participant reached a steady state, where only minor heart rate fluctuations occurred within the target heart rate zone. During the test, standardized encouragements were used and cancellation criteria were monitored. After six minutes, the test ended. Using a nomogram, the mean heart rate of minute ve and six are compared against the watts that the participant trained at. Depending on the subject's age, a correction factor was applied, and the VO 2max per kg was determined [ 67]. Gender and age-adjusted norms were used to classify participants in groups with low, moderate or high tness levels [68]. 2.3. Statistical Analyses A power analysis (using G*Power 3.1.9.3, Heinrich Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany) indicated that for F-tests (ANCOVA: Fixed e ects, main e ects and interactions) a minimum of 158 participants are needed to detect moderate e ects (alpha error =0.05, power =0.80, df =2, groups =3). Descriptive and inferential statistics were calculated using IBM SPSS Statistics 25 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). We carried out two separate two-factorial multivariate analyses of covariance (MANCOVAs) with (a) cardiovascular risk factors and (b) mental health outcomes as dependent variables, which were followed by a series of two-factorial analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) to examine main and interaction e ects of stress and CRF levels. To ensure a su \u000ecient number of participants per cell, we compared two groups with low vs. high stress levels, and three groups with low, moderate, and high tness levels. All analyses were controlled for age, gender, education (\"What is your highest level of education; without the police training?\"), employment rate (\"What was your average employment level over the last 6 months?\"), relationship status (\"What is your current relationship situation?\" Response options: single; married or in a relationship), children at home (\"How many children do you have who still live at home?\"), caregiving responsibility (\"Are you currently the main person responsible for a family member or friend in need of care?\"), supervisor status (\"How many people do you have direct supervision responsibility for?\"), work experience (\"How many years have you been employed by the police?\"), shift-work status (\"Do you work in shifts or daytime?\"), smoking (\"Do you smoke?\"), and medication intake (\"Do you regularly take medication?\"). To maximize statistical power, all outcomes were treated as continuous variables in the (M)ANCOVAs (and not as risk categories) [ 45]. Moreover, all missing values were replaced via expectation maximation (EM) algorithm [ 69]. The 5% level of signicance was used to test main and interaction e ects. Partial eta squared ( \u00112) were used to interpret the strengths of the e ects. Beyond single cardiometabolic risk factors, we also calculated a clustered metabolic risk index, which corresponded to a continuously distributed score (with higher scores being indicative of higher total cardiometabolic risk). To obtain this score, the z-standardized residuals were computed for the following variables [ LDL-C, TG and Hb1Ac. 3. Results 3.1. Sample Description Two hundred and one (201) o \u000ecers (129 men, 72 women) volunteered to take part in the data assessment. The mean age was 38.6 years (standard deviation [SD] =10.1). Twenty percent reported living alone, whereas 80% were married or living with someone. On average, o \u000ecers were working since 12.9 years (SD =8.8) in the police force (range: 1-37 years). Most of the participants wereInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019 ,16, 2349 7 of 19 full-time employees (83%), 12% reported employment rates between 50 and 90%, and 6% reported an employment rate between 20 and 40%. Fourteen percent of the participants have higher education (college /university degree), 32% have completed high school or advanced vocational training, whereas 54% have basic vocational training. More than half of the participants (57%) had no children, whereas 16% had one child, 24% two children, and 3% three or more children. Three percent currently had carer responsibilities, 47% percent of the participants were shift-workers, 20% were smokers, and 16% reported that they take medication on a regular basis. Finally, 37% had supervisor status, with supervisors being responsible for 1 to 80 subordinate employees (M =10.7, SD =14.8). 3.2. Descriptive Statistics and Correlations between Independent and Dependent Variables Descriptive statistics for all independent and dependent variables are summarized in Table 1. Following Cifkova et al. [ 70], 17.9% and 32.2%, of the participants were classied as respectively, the cut-o on WHO [ 71] recommendations, 52.2% of the participants were classied as and 9.5% as obese (BMI \u001530.0 kg /m2). Following the expert panel of the National Cholesterol Education Program [ 72], which dened a waist circumference of \u001580 cm (women) and \u001594 cm (men) as risk factor for metabolic syndrome, 65.3% of women and 45.7% of men exceeded this cut-o . With regard to body fat, the WHO [ 71] recommends maximum levels of \u001532% for women and\u001525% for men. Based on these standards, 22.2% of women and 11.1% of men had excessive body fat levels. Following Rodondi et al. [ 73], the following clinically relevant cut-o s should be considered sample, these s were exceeded by 25.9% (total cholesterol), 16.4% (HDL-C) and 10.9% (LDL-C) of the participants. Moreover, based on the recommendations of the expert panel of the National Cholesterol Education Program [ 72], 31.3% exceeded the clinical cut-o for triglycerides (\u00151.71 mmol /L). Following the criteria of the American Diabetes Association [ 74], we identied 31 participants with prediabetes (HbA1c \u00155.7%) and three participants with diabetes (HbA1c \u00156.5%). With regard to mental health, burnout scores of \u00154.40 can be considered as clinically relevant [ 59], whereas scores of \u001515 [61] and 4 [ 75], respectively, point towards clinical levels of insomnia or excessive mental distress. Based on these standards, 4.0%, 6.5% and 14.4% reported clinically relevant levels of burnout, sleep complaints, and excessive mental distress. Two of the variables (triglycerides, HbA1c) exceeded the recommended values for skewness (value of 2) and kurtosis (value of 7) [ 76]. We therefore built the logarithm of these scores before calculating the ANCOVAs. With regard to stress, 80 participants (40%) had JDC scores >1 and 54 participants (27%) had ERI scores >1. These participants were considered as being exposed to high occupational stress levels. Finally, based on the ACSM classication standards, 53 participants (26%) had low CRF, 59 participants (29%) had moderate CRF, and 89 participants (44%) had high CRF levels. Bivariate correlations between independent and dependent study variables are displayed in Table 1. Signicant correlations were found between both occupational stress measures and the three mental health indicators. Few signicant correlations existed between the JDC and ERI ratio and the cardiovascular health outcomes. The only signicant correlations were found between the JDC ratio and HbA1c, and the ERI ratio and BMI, waist circumference, as well as the total cardiometabolic risk factor score. Higher CRF was correlated with higher BMI, higher waist circumference, lower body fat, and lower HDL cholesterol. By contrast, no signicant correlations were found between participants' CRF level and any of the mental health indicators. Weak to moderate correlations existed between most of the various cardiometabolic risk factors, whereas moderate to strong correlations were observed between burnout symptoms, insomnia symptoms and overall mental wellbeing.Int.

If stress was operationalized via the JDC model, the MANCOVA showed a signicant main e ect for the factor CRF, F(20, 350) =3.2, p<0.001, \u00112=0.154, whereas no signicant F(10, 175) =0.4, p=not signicant (ns), \u00112=0.023 , stress, F(20, 350) =1.4,p=ns,\u00112=0.075 , after controlling for covariates. Table 2 further shows the ndings of the ANCOVAs, displaying the means and standard deviations for the six subgroups with low vs. high occupational stress, and low, moderate vs. high cardiorespiratory tness. These values are followed by the inferential statistics (F, \u00112values) for the main e ects of stress and cardiovascular tness, and the interaction between these two constructs. Table 2 yields a relatively consistent picture across all outcomes. Thus, participants with higher tness levels showed more favorable scores across almost all cardiovascular risk factors (BMI, waist circumference, body fat, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, HbA1c). No signicant main e ects for cardiorespiratory tness were found for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol. In line with these ndings, a relatively strong main e ect (12.7% of explained variance) was found for the total cardiometabolic risk index, showing that participants with the highest tness level had the most favorable scores, followed by those with moderate and low tness levels (see Table 2). With regard to the mental health indicators, the MANCOVA yielded a signicant main e ect for the factor stress, F(3, 182) =6.8,p<0.001, \u00112=0.101, whereas 364) =1.0, p=ns,\u00112=0.017. In line with this nding, we three signicant main e ects in the univariate ANCOVAs for occupational stress, showing that independent of their tness levels, o \u000ecers who perceive higher levels of occupational stress report more symptoms of mental ill-health than their less stressed colleagues. In the univariate analyses, we did not nd any signicant interaction e ects between occupational stress and cardiorespiratory tness for any of the study variables. E ort-reward imbalance (ERI model). If stress was operationalized via the ERI model, the MANCOVA showed a signicant main e ect for the factor CRF, F(20, 350) =3.2, p<0.001, \u00112=0.155, whereas no signicant for the factor stress, F(10, 175) =0.9,p=ns,\u00112=0.047 , or the interaction between CRF and stress, F(20, 350) =1.1,p=ns,\u00112=0.062, after controlling for covariates. As shown in Table 3, the results pattern described for the JDC model was similar when we carried out the univariate ANCOVAs with the ERI model. Again, we found signicant main e ects for tness for the following variables: DBP , BMI, waist circumference, body fat, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and total cardiometabolic risk. By contrast, no signicant main e ects were found for occupational stress. Finally, contrary to the results of the multivariate analysis, three signicant univariate interactions were observed for total cholesterol, triglycerides, and total cardiometabolic risk. As shown in Figure 1 for the total cardiometabolic risk index, participants with low CRF levels had particularly high cardiometabolic risk scores if exposed to high occupational stress. As for the JDC model, in the MANCOVA with the mental health indicators as outcomes, we found a signicant main e ect for stress F(3, 191) =5.6,p<0.001, \u00112=0.081, whereas no signicant e ects occurred for CRF F(6, 382) =1.2,p=ns,\u00112=0.018, and the interaction between stress and CRF, F(6, 382) =0.6,p=ns,\u00112=0.009, if stress was operationalized via an imbalance between job-related e orts and reward. In line with this, the univariate ANCOVAs indicated signicant main e ects across all mental health indicators, showing that o \u000ecers with higher stress levels report more mental health complaints. The e ect sizes (4.9 to 10.0% of explained variance) were moderate to strong. No signicant interaction e ects were found between occupational stress and cardiorespiratory tness.Int. J. Environ. Res.

Note: Higher scores on the total cardiometabolic risk index reflect higher cardiometabolic risk. 4. Discussion The key findings of the present study are that high cardiorespiratory fitness levels were associated with a reduced cardiometabolic risk, wh ereas high levels of occupational stress were associated with more burnout symptoms, sleep complaints and increased overall psychological distress. However, moderation effects of cardio respiratory fitness on the relationship between occupational stress and the examined health outc omes were only found fo r the ERI ratio on total cholesterol, triglycerides and the total cardiometabolic risk index. The interaction revealed that participants with low fitness levels had a particularly high cardiometabolic risk if they were exposed to high levels of this type of occupational stress. Our first hypothesis was that higher occupational stress would be associated with an increased cardiovascular risk, as well as decreased mental health. While the association with mental health was confirmed, in the (M)ANCOVAS, no significant differences were found between officers with low versus high occupational stress levels with regard to cardiovascular risk factors. This pattern holds true for both occupational stress models. The fact that occupational stress was associated with mental health complaints is in line with previous research [11]. For instan ce, high job strain and high effo rt-reward imbalance predisposed the development of depression, burnout, and general ment al health (GHQ-12) in prospective cohort studies with 2555 dentists [77] and 22,899 public service work ers [78]. A close association between occupational stress and mental health has also be en observed in police officers [26,79]. By contrast, the fact that occupational stress was unrelated to further health outcomes in the present sample was unexpected and at odds with previous research among police o fficers [28]. However, the existing findings are difficult to compare as researchers have used variou s instruments to assess occu pational stress. In this context, Magnavita et al. [28] criticized that \"m ost of the studies available provided a general non- specific measure of perceived stress that included both general and occupational stress\" (p. 386). Figure 1. Graphical representation of the interaction between occupational stress (as assessed with the ERI ration) and cardiorespiratory tness on total cardiometabolic risk. Note: Higher scores on the total cardiometabolic risk index reflect higher cardiometabolic risk. 4. Discussion The key ndings of the present study are that high cardiorespiratory tness levels were associated with a reduced cardiometabolic risk, whereas high levels of occupational stress were associated with more burnout symptoms, sleep complaints and increased overall psychological distress. However, moderation e ects of cardiorespiratory tness on the relationship between occupational stress and the examined health outcomes were only found for the ERI ratio on total cholesterol, triglycerides and the total cardiometabolic risk index. The interaction revealed that participants with low tness levels had a particularly high cardiometabolic risk if they were exposed to high levels of this type of occupational stress. Our rst hypothesis was that higher occupational stress would be associated with an increased cardiovascular risk, as well as decreased mental health. While the association with mental health was conrmed, in the (M)ANCOVAS, no signicant di erences were found between o \u000ecers with low versus high occupational stress levels with regard to cardiovascular risk factors. This pattern holds true for both occupational stress models. The fact that occupational stress was associated with mental health complaints is in line with previous research [ 11]. For instance, high job strain and high e ort-reward imbalance predisposed the development of depression, burnout, and general mental health (GHQ-12) in prospective cohort studies with 2555 dentists [ 77] and 22,899 public service workers [ 78]. A close association between occupational stress and mental health has also been observed in police o \u000ecers [ 26,79]. By contrast, the fact that occupational stress was unrelated to further health outcomes in the present sample was unexpected and at odds with previous research among police o \u000ecers [ 28]. However, the existing ndings are di \u000ecult to compare as researchers have used various instruments to assess occupational stress. In this context, Magnavita et al. [ 28] criticized that \"most of the studies available provided a general non-specic measure of perceived stress that included both general and occupational stress\" (p. 386).Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019 ,16, 2349 13 of 19 Our second hypothesis was that higher levels of cardiorespiratory tness would be associated with a lower cardiovascular risk, and fewer mental health complaints. Again, partial support was found for this hypothesis. Thus, in line with previous research in the police setting [ 80], we observed a favorable pattern of cardiovascular health markers among police o \u000ecers with higher cardiovascular tness levels. By contrast, no signicant associations were found between o \u000ecers' tness levels and their mental health. Our ndings were in line with previous studies showing that cardiorespiratory tness had the potential to enhance people's cardiovascular health [ 81]. In a recent work by the American Heart Association, Ross et al. [ 82] provided a review of the rich body of evidence linking higher cardiovascular tness to healthier levels of blood pressure, visceral adiposity, insulin sensitivity, as well as lipid and lipoprotein proles. In a cross-sectional study with 2368 men and 2263 women, Aspenes et al. [ 83] measured cardiorespiratory tness by spiroergometry on a treadmill. Despite the generally low tness levels identied in their study population, logistic regression revealed that with every 5-mL \u0001kg\u00001\u0001min\u00001decline in VO 2max the odds ratio for the cardiovascular risk factor cluster increased by 56% [ 83]. Fernstr\u00f6m et al. [ 84] reported similar ndings among young adults aged 18 to 25 years. With regard to mental health, positive associations with cardiorespiratory tness have been reported previously. For instance, Vancampfort et al. [ 85] reported that people with severe mental illness have signicantly lower cardiorespiratory tness levels than healthy controls. Gerber et al. [ 86] further found that cardiorespiratory tness was associated with burnout symptoms among Swedish health care workers, while Ortega et al. [ 87] found cardiorespiratory tness and mental well-being to be independent predictors of mortality in a prospective study of 4888 participants. Thus, the fact that cardiorespiratory tness and mental health were not associated with each other in the present sample was unexpected. However, the absence of this relationship can be attributed to the fact that our sample might have been healthier than those in prior research, entailing a possible ceiling e ect [88]. Thus, according to ACSM standards, only 26% had poor or very poor tness levels, whereas 44.5% had fair to excellent, and 30% even superior tness levels. Moreover, only 4 to 7% exceeded the clinical threshold for burnout and sleep complaints, respectively, which is considerably below the rates found in previous studies [37,62]. Our third hypothesis was that cardiorespiratory tness would moderate the relationship between occupational stress and physical /mental health indicators, but our ndings only partly supported this notion. When stress was operationalized via the JDC model, no signicant moderation was found. Nevertheless, when stress was operationalized via the ERI model, a signicant interaction was found between occupational stress and CRF on total cholesterol, triglycerides and total cardiometabolic risk, showing that participants with low CRF had particularly high cardiometabolic risk scores when they perceived a high imbalance between e orts and reward. This nding is in line with two studies with Swedish health care workers [ 37] and Swiss schoolchildren [ 89], where similar interactions were observed. As shown in Table 1, only a few (weak) correlations were found between work-related stress on the cardiovascular health indicators. Accordingly, the potential for CRF to moderate this relationship was limited in the present sample. This may also explain why signicant interaction e ects were found for some, but not all cardiovascular health indicators. Furthermore, the correlations between the JDC and ERI index with the cardiovascular health outcomes pointed into di erent directions. This may be the reason why interaction e ects were only found for the ERI ratio, whereas no such e ects were observed for the JDC ratio. In a recent review, Klaperski [ 90] showed that physical tness bu ered the negative e ects of stress in the majority of the eligible studies. However, one study cited in this review found no support for a stress-bu ering e ect on blood pressure and HDL-C in law enforcement o \u000ecers [ 91]. Young [ 91] attributed these results to the chronicity of the measure of work stress, which might additionally not have been sensitive enough to discern physiological variations in healthy individuals. Some authors further state that physical tness possibly bu ers the acute stress response in mentally demanding occupations, rather than the long-term e ects of stress [ 92]. Although well established in the laboratory setting [ 93], to date only a few studies investigated theInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019 ,16, 2349 14 of 19 stress-bu ering e ects of physical tness on acute stress reactivity in real life. In a randomized controlled trial, von Haaren et al. [ 33] showed that a 20-week aerobic exercise training bu ered the physiological stress response to real life stressors. The authors were able to show associations of an improved cardiorespiratory tness and ambulatory assessed heart rate variability during two days of the examination period in 61 previously sedentary university students. Due to the current relevance of occupational stress, there is a clear demand for further evidence on this issue. The strengths of our study are that we assessed occupational stress with standardized and validated instruments that are based on the two of the most popular and internationally accepted stress models [ 28]. Using an established cut-o to distinguish between participants with low versus high stress levels further allows a comparison with existing studies. Moreover, we assessed a broad range of health indicators to provide a comprehensive picture of the o \u000ecers' health status. Another advantage was that cardiorespiratory tness was assessed objectively, and that age- and gender-adjusted norms were used to classify participants in groups with low, moderate or high tness levels. Finally, this is one of the few studies in which tness-based stress-bu er e ects were tested with objective health outcomes. This is important, as most previous studies have focused on (subjectively reported) health outcomes. Thus, in these studies the relationship between occupational stress and health might be inflated because of the shared method variance. By contrast, some aspects limit the generalizability of our data. First, our study is cross-sectional, which precludes conclusions about causality [ 28,92]. Second, several blood lipid measures were considered when we calculated the overall cardiometabolic risk index [ 45]. However, as blood lipids were only weakly associated with cardiorespiratory tness, it can be assumed that using our formula is likely to have resulted in an under-estimation of the association between cardiorespiratory tness and overall cardiometabolic risk. Third, given the voluntary nature of the study, a recruitment bias is conceivable. However, the tness categories still discriminated between participants with more or less favorable cardiometabolic risk patterns, and the ERI /JDC categories explained signicant amounts of variance in the mental health outcomes. Fourth and last, physical work place characteristics were not systematically assessed in the present study [ 94]. However, information regarding participants' shift work status allowed us to control for the fact of whether o \u000ecers engaged in o \u000ece or eld service. 5. Conclusions Our ndings suggest that occupational stress is negatively associated with police o \u000ecers' mental wellbeing. Our results also suggest that occupational stress may be more closely related to psychological health than physical health. Therefore, work health programs for police o \u000ecers should consider the early screening of burnout, sleep disturbances, and overall mental well-being. CRF, as measured with a submaximal bicycle test, appears to be a relevant marker for cardiovascular health in police o \u000ecers. Moreover, o \u000ecers with moderate or high CRF levels have a lower overall cardiometabolic risk when they perceive a strong imbalance between their invested e orts and their reward at work. To increase cardiovascular health, we encourage the inclusion of tness tests in routine health checks, and the promotion of physical activity to further increase the tness levels among police o \u000ecers.

Policeofcers are especially at risk of high psychosocial stress; therefore, effective intervention strategies are warranted. Given this background, the purpose of the present study was toexamine whether police of cers with different levels of cardiorespiratory tness differ with regard to their (a) physiological stress reactivity during acute real-life stress situations, and (b) physiological recovery related to acute and chronic work stress. In total, 201 policeofcers took part in this study (M = 38.6 years, SD = 10.1, 35.8% females). Of cers were contacted eight times on a smartphone during their workday, and asked to report theircurrent level of positive and negative affect, as well as feelings of stress and anger.Physiological stress responses and recovery (heart rate variability) were assessed usingMovisens EcgMove3 devices. The \u00c5strand bicycle ergometer test was used to assessparticipants' cardiorespiratory tness. Chronic work stress was assessed using the effort- reward imbalance model and the job strain model. Multilevel modeling was used to testbuffering effects of cardiorespiratory tness on physiological stress reactivity. Linear regression was applied to test stress-buffering effects of cardiorespiratory tness on physiological recovery. Results showed lowered physiological stress reactivity to acutework stress in of cers with higher levels of cardiorespiratory tness. However, these results were not consistent, with no effects occurring for feelings of anger, positive affect,and negative affect. Chronic work stress (effort-reward imbalance) was related to lowerphysiological recovery. Cardiorespiratory tness was positively related to physiological recovery. Data did not support interactions between work stress and cardiorespiratorytness on physiological recovery. To some extent, cardiorespiratory tness seems to have the potential to buffer stress reactivity in police of cers in acute stress situations. Therefore, we encourage promoting tness programs which aim to enhance cardiorespiratory tness in stressful occupations such as law enforcement.

Keywords: cardiorespiratory tness, stress-buffer, cross-stressor adaptation, heart rate variability, occupational stress, stress reactivity, stress recovery, ecological momentary assessment, ambulatory assessment INTRODUCTION Psychosocial stress is ubiquitous in modern society ( 1). Although not regarded as negative per se , health complaints can occur when individual's coping capacities are exceeded. Documented links between psychosocial stress and health impairments range from physical (e.g. cardiorespiratory) and mental diseases (e.g.burnout) to all-cause mortality ( 2,3). Consequently, the individual and societal burden is tremendous ( 4); hence, health services and researchers are keen to nd ways to strengthen coping abilities ( 5). Conceptualizations for pathways linking stress to health have historically developed from response (biopsychological) andstimulus (stressor) approaches to transactional processes, inwhich perceptions of stress play a key role ( 6). Berntson and Cacioppo ( 7) argue that mechanisms of stress which affect health involve at least four process components: exposure, reactivity,recovery, and restoration. Exposure is understood as a quantitative representation of perceived stressors. Reactivity refers to the strength of a (physiological) stress reaction in relation to abaseline value. This could be an elevated heart rate following astress event. Recovery is understood the amount of time requireduntil an individual has returned to baseline level following a stressreaction. Restoration, a more unique concept, refers to \"anabolic processes that refresh or repair the organism, because stress may directly impede our ability to perform these functions (e.g.,disturbed sleep and impaired wound healing) \"(p. 609). Cardiorespiratory tness (CF) is understood as a potential buffer in the interplay between stress and health. In their review,Gerber and P\u00fchse ( 8) gleaned evidence on positive moderation effects for exercise and resulting CF on the interplay between stress and health. Mechanisms of improved cardiovascular healthare thought to relate to changes in the autonomic nervous system(8). The sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system are main components in the sympathoadrenal-medullary (SAM)axis. In stressful situations, the SAM axis pathways increaseheart rate, breathing pattern, and blood pressure ( 9). Recurring and excessive activity of the SAM contributes to increased cardiovascular risk, for example, by increasing the likelihood ofhypertension ( 10). Findings further suggest that physical strain produced by regular engagement in exercise and improvedphysical tness are associated with adaptations (i.e. lowered resting heart rate and blood pressure) that may counteract the negative consequences of stress. Furthermore, the cross-stressor adaptation hypothesis ( 11) suggests that repeated exposure to physical strain can result in at least partially unspeci c adaptations, which may cross over to other areas of stress (e.g.,psychosocial), and thus lead to more favorable adaptationsassociated with stress ( 12).Research on stress-buffering mechanisms to enhance health has mainly focused on stress reactivity and recovery ( 2,8). Previous investigations generally support stress-buffering effects associated with CF ( 13). However, evidence from three meta- analyses on the impact of CF on cardiovascular reactivity andrecovery during and after exposure to experimentally inducedstressor tasks have provided heterogeneous results ( 14-16). In their early work, Crews and Landers ( 14) showed that CF was associated with a blunted stress reactivity. Twenty years later,Forcier et al. ( 15)c a m et oas i m i l a rc o n c l u s i o nw h e nu s i n g more strict inclusion criteria. Thus, their meta-analysis found improved reactivity and some support for improvedcardiovascular recovery among individuals with higher CFlevels. Controversially, in a further meta-analysis, Jackson andDishman ( o for attenuated stress reactivity among tter individuals. However, higher tness levels were associated with a sli ghtly better cardiovascular recovery from laboratory stressors. One strength of theirresults is the inclusion of studies using submaximal ormaximal tness tests, which, according to the American College of Sports Medicine ( 17), is a prerequisite for a valid determination of CF. Further more, in a recent systematic literature review, M\u00fccke et al. ( 12) gathered evidence on the influence of CF on stress reactivity in response to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), a psychosocial laboratory stressor thathas proven to elicit particularly strong stress reactions inprevious studies ( 18). Approximately half of the studies included in this review showed that higher levels of tness were related to attenuated stress reactivity, as measured via heart rate variability and salivary cortisol concentrations ( 12). One possible explanation for the inconsistent results in the afore-mentioned meta-analyses might be seen in the diversity ofstressors used in the laboratory ( 19). Arti cial stressors are sometimes passive physical performance tasks (holding thehand in a bucket of ice water), and oftentimes consist ofcognitive instead of psychosocial challenges. Furthermore, when measuring stress in a laboratory setting, even psychosocial stressors might not be personally relevant ( 20). Additionally, such stressors are mostly isolated events which aretypically short-term, whereas the effects of long-termpsychosocial stress are more important from a healthperspective. Accordingly, due to limited external validity, results obtained in laboratory settings might not be generalizable to a real-life context. Scholars have thereforeemphasized that more meaningful insights should be gained inresearch carried out in more naturalistic environments ( 20,21). Stress experiences at work are very common in adults ( 5). Two of the most recognized theoretical models in research onwork stress are the effort-reward imbalance (ERI) model, whichSchilling et al. Stress-Buffering Effects of Cardiorespiratory Fitness Frontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org June 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 594 2assumes that stress is the consequence of an imbalance between perceived efforts and rewards at work, as well as the job demandsand control (JDC) model, which states that stress occurs ifperceived demands and control at work are outbalanced ( 24) showed that in both models increased stress is related to higher cardiovascular mortality. In a retrospective study, the authors examined approximately 800 (mainly male)workers in the metal industry, with an average follow-up time of25 years. Mortality risk ratios increased to 2.4 (95% CI: 1.3, 4.4)for high ERI, and 2.2 (95% CI: 1.2, 4.2) for high job strain (JDCimbalance), respectively. Furthermore, the risk associated with higher stress levels decreased by 30% in the intermediately physically active group, and by 60% in the highly physicallyactive group. In order to assess physiological stress reactivity and recovery objectively in real-life, heart rate variability (HRV) has become apopular and frequently used parameter in stress research ( 25). HRV refers to fluctuations in time intervals of successive heart beats (N-N intervals), measured in milliseconds. Thesedifferences can be attributed to branches of the aforementionedSAM axis (sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system)(26). The Root Mean Squares of Successive N-N Differences (RMSSD), a measure of parasympathetic activity, is usedfrequently as an indicator of physiological stress reactivity and recovery in real-life measurements ( 27). assess HRV- based physiological reactivity as hourly ( 28)a n dd a i l y( 29) aggregations of HRV values, or as the differences between dayand night HRV values ( 29,30). HRV-based physiological aggregated night HRV levels ( 28, 29,31), as well as balance indices between day and night HRV (32). Existing evidence suggests that stress-related differences in HRV are signi cantly associated with cardiovascular disease ( 33) and mortality ( 34). In their review, Tonello, Rodrigues, Souza, Campbell, Leicht, and Boullosa ( 35) reported strong negative correlations between work stress and HRV. However, the authors stated that optimalmethods for detecting adaptations related to cardiac autonomous stress viaHRV still need to be developed. A more recent review by J\u00e4rvelin-Pasanen et al. ( 27)o nw o r ks t r e s sa n dH R V corroborated the general results of Tonello et al. ( 35), and added more detailed information on the speci cH R V parameters that were evidently in fluenced by chronic and acute work stress. Vrijkotte et al. ( 32), for example, assessed chronic and acute work stress in a sample of 109 male white-collar workers, which were followed-up for two consecutive workdays.Stress levels were matched to RMSSD, as a HRV parameterreflecting vagal tone. The high ERI group showed lower RMSSD, pointing towards decreased parasympathetic activity inindividuals with higher chronic work stress. Work stress of thecurrent day was assessed using the Pro le of Mood States (assessed in the evening, retrospectively for the day). Although ERI scores were associated with negative mood states, nosignicant relationships were observed between mood states and HRV ( 32). Finally, the randomized controlled trial by von Haaren et al. ( 28) for the rst time points towards the stress-buffering potential of increased CF when objective stress markers are assessed in a real-life context. More speci cally, in a sample of 61 sedentary university stude nts, an increase in CF after a standardized physical activity (PA) intervention was associatedwith higher RMSSD ( b= 0.15) during a period of heightened academic stress (exam period). The existing literature on real-life stress is often based on cross-sectional designs, with single work stress scores oraggregated HRV-values, respectively. J\u00e4rvelin-Pasanen et al.(27) explicitly highlighted the lack of longitudinal studies. However, studies with longitudinal designs are important for atleast two reasons: First, single chronic stress scores or aggregated mean levels in outcomes might show different associations than multiple acute stress perceptions/responses ( 36). Second, the individual evaluation of the predictability and controllability ofstressors is fundamental for the reaction to them ( 37). Nevertheless, these intra-individual differences are notsufciently accounted for by inter-individual study designs. In order to highlight differences between situations that are considered highly stressful versus not stressful, participants have to function as their own controls. Hence, studies withwithin-subject designs become necessary ( 38). While traditional methods have applied retrospective self- reports, technological imp rovements enable real-life measurements viaecological momentary assessment (EMA). Using portable devices, experiences can be assessed in real- time, rather than necessitating long-term recall ( 39). Consequently, stress research has experienced a growinginterest in state variables, such as emotional reactions andchanging mood states ( 40). Emotions and mood states are understood as cognitively mediated psychophysiological reactions that are limited in time ( 40). Emotions (i.e. anger, fear) are situational and intense, whereas mood states are longer-lasting, rather unspeci c background phenomena, and not consistently cued by speci c events ( 40). In an ambulatory research study with 73 teachers ( M= 46.7 years, SD = 9.5; van der Leeden, and Thayer ( 41) showed independent associations of stressful events and worry episodes with lowered HRV (measured as RMSSD). Uusitalo, Mets, Martinmaki, Mauno, Kinnunen, andRusko ( 42) examined the relationship between emotions (stress, irritation, satisfaction) during two workdays using mean valuesof emotions and HRV in a sample of 19 hospital workers. Astrong negative correlation between feelings of stress during work and RMSSD ( r=0.70 to r=0.80) indicated lowered parasympathetic activity in an acute stress response. Similarly,chronic work stress, measured as imbalance between efforts andrewards, was strongly related to RMSSD ( r=0.53). Taken together, there is still a marked lack of research addressing the stress-buffering effect of CF in real-life contexts.Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to examine whether police of cers with different levels of CF differ with regard to their (a) physiological stress reactivity during acutereal-life stress situations, and (b) physiological recovery relatedto acute and chronic work stress. Based on the aforementionedliterature, two hypotheses were tested:Schilling et al. Stress-Buffering Effects of Cardiorespiratory Fitness Frontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org June 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 594 3\u0081With the rst hypothesis, we expected individuals to show a greater physiological stress reactivity (decrease in HRV) inacute work stress situations with lower group levels of CF(28). \u0081With the second hypothesis, we expected improved physiological recovery (increased HRV) in groups with higher levels of CF when exposed to acute and chronic work stress situations ( 30). MATERIALS AND PROCEDURES Participants Participants were recruited from the police force of the canton Basel-Stadt, a German-speaking city in Switzerland. Allemployees were invited to participate viaintranet, internal newspaper, internal TV-adverts, and during team meetings.The present data is part of a voluntary health-check in a bigger project (HERO-study). Additionally, a lifestyle coaching and a second health check were offered to interested of cers. Data presented in this article are based on the rst health check, which took place between October 2017 and March 2018. Following theinvitation, of cers had the opportunity to use an e-learning tool, consisting of short text modules and video sequences, in whichthe general purpose and procedures of the study were explained. Furthermore, information was provided regarding the voluntary nature of participation, the absence of negative consequences incase of non-participation, bene ts and risks, rights and obligations, as well as detailed information about themeasurements. No monetary incentives were provided to theofcers. However, the health check was performed during (paid) working hours and participants received a personalized health prole. At the end of the e-learning phase, participants had the possibility to schedule their own assessment. To participate inthe submaximal CF test, participants had to pass a PA readinesscheck, based on the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire(PAR-Q) ( 43). Participants who did not pass the PAR-Q had to provide a doctor's certi cate, attesting that the treating doctor considers it safe for the participant to participate in a submaximal tness test. The Basel-Stadt police force consists of approximately 1,000 ofcers. From these, 227 agreed to obtain more detailed information viathe e-learning tool (approx. 23%), and 201 ofcers decided to participate in the study (88%). All participants provided written informed consent prior to data assessment. All procedures followed the ethical principles of theDeclaration of Helsinki. The Ethics Committee for Northwest/Central Switzerland approved the study (EKNZ: Project-ID:2017-01477). Procedures Data used in the present paper was acquired during the laboratory session and in real-life. The laboratory session took place at the education and training center of the police force; alltests were performed in a private setting in the same speciallyequipped room. All assessments were carried out by the same investigator. In real-life, heart rate was monitored for 48 h. Toensure the assessment of full (daytime) working days amongshift-workers, the real-life assessment started on their rst day of a shift cycle. By contrast, among participants with regular of ce shifts, the real-life assessment started on a day before two full working days (usually Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday). To ensure comparability, we analyzed the full workday, followingtherst night. Furthermore, this procedure may have served to limit low stress measurements, since participants might havescheduled the laboratory session (health check) on days withrelatively low workload. At the end of the laboratory session, participants received the sensors and smartphones, as well as oral and written instructions regarding smartphone usage. The real-life measurement started immediately after the laboratorysession. Participants wore t he heart rate monitor for 48 h consecutively, and answered questions regarding their stressemotions and affect states on a smartphone (see Measures section for more speci c information). Measures Cardiorespiratory Fitness Cardiorespiratory tness (CF) was measured with the validated and internationally applied \u00c5strand Fitness Test ( 44). In a submaximal performance test on a bicycle ergometer, maximal oxygen consumption (VO 2max) is estimated by standardized extrapolations of heart rates at certain resistances ( 45,46). Standardized instructions prior to the testing included theavoidance of any strenuous PA for 24 h, as well as heavym e a l s ,a n dl i q u i d so t h e rt h a nw a t e rf o r3h .F o rt h et e s t ,participants were equipped with a heart rate monitor. Standardized workloads were set for men (150 watts) and women (100 watts). This workload was adjusted to keep theheart rate in the range of 130 -160 (bpm) for participants <40 years, and 120 -150 (bpm) for participants 40 years. Cycling cadence was set at 60 rotations per minute. At the end of eachminute, heart rate was noted, and participants stated theirperceived exertion on a Borg scale ( 47). Prior to the test, participants were instructed that perceived exertion should be between 11 to 16 on the Borg scale (below the maximum range)(47). Standardized encouragements were used and participants were controlled for cancelation criteria ( 17). After 6 min, the test ended if heart rate over the last 2 min did not vary by more than5 beats per minute. Otherwise, participants were asked to proceed for another minute until this criterion was met. The mean heart rate of the nal 2 min was compared against the nal stage watts to achieve a gender adjusted VO 2max (ml/kg/min). These values were matched with CF percentiles using age andgender speci c norm values presented by the ACSM ( 17). Following ACSM recommendations, we further classi ed poor, \"\"poor, \"\"fair,\"\"good, \" \"excellent, \"and\"superior \"(17). Chronic Work Stress Chronic work stress was measured at the end of the laboratory session. Hereby, the Effort-Reward Imbalance (ERI) scale ( 22)Schilling et al. Stress-Buffering Effects of Cardiorespiratory Fitness Frontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org June 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 594 4and the Job Demand and Control (JDC) scale ( 48)w e r e administered using an online questionnaire. The ERI scaleconsists of 5 items for efforts (i.e. \"I have a lot of responsibility in my job \") and 11 items for rewards (i.e. \"I receive the respect I deserve from my superior or a respective relevant person. \"). Answers are given on a ve-point Likert-scale ranging from 1 (none) to 5 (very high). After summing up each dimension, the ratio was calculated using the factor 0.4545 to counterbalance theunequal number of questions (effort/[reward*0.4545]). Ratiosabove 1 re flect high levels of job stress ( 22). The JDC scale consists of ve items for demands (i.e. \"My job requires me to work very fast \") and six items for control (i.e. \"I have freedom to make decisions about my job \"). Answers are given on a four- point Likert-scale ranging from 1 (never) to 4 (often). Sum scoresfor each dimension were calculated. As for ERI, the JDC-ratiowas calculated using the factor 0.8333 to balance the unequalnumbers of questions (demands/[control*0.8333]). JDCRatios >1 indicate high work stress ( 49). The validity and reliability of this instrument has been described previously ( 50). Ecological Momentary Assessment Psychological variables in real-life were assessed viathe EMA method. Each time they were contacted, participants answereddifferent sets of questions on a smartphone (Moto G, 3dGeneration) Movisens XS offers a web-based software so lution for question settings, sampling contingents, and management of participants; at alater stage, the software processes and prepares data output foranalysis. Three sets of questions were triggered in the morning,during the workday, and in the evening. The present paperconsiders the workday set, which will now be described in detail.The workday set sampled between 12 am and 7 pm for all shift workers (matching their shift schedule) and between 9 am and 5 pm for regular of ce workers. Sets were time-triggered once per hour with a random appearance of +/ 15 min. The participants responded to an alarm (tone and vibration), which otherwisewould repeat every 5 min; if participants did not complete thesurvey after 15 min, the current assessment was closed. Additionally, participants had the opportunity to postpone the rst alarm for up to 15 min. In this case, only one further alarm was triggered 15 min later. Acute Work Stress In the present study, acute work stress is used as an umbrellaterm for affective states, as well as feelings of stress, and feelingsof anger. The term \"feelings of stress \"is speci cally used for the acute feeling of being stressed, as a single variable only. Approximately 2 min were needed to answer an entire set ofquestions. Instructions on how to respond to questionsassociated with the assessment of acute work stress were givenduring the laboratory session. More speci cally, participants were asked to refer to the current situation right before the assessment when answering questions on affect states, feelings of stress, and anger. Since psychological variables were linked toHRV, we controlled for PA as a possible confounder, using twocontrol questions: \"Have you been physically active during thepast 15 minutes? \"and\"Have you been physically inactive during the past 15 minutes? \"For these questions, participants were instructed to ignore very short walks and standing periods. Positive and negative affect states were assessed using an adapted German version of the Positive And Negative AffectSchedule (PANAS) ( 51). Validity of this instrument has been presented previously ( 52). Participants were asked how they feel at the moment. The items were re flective of ve positive (i.e. \"content, \"\"delighted \")a n d ve negative affect states (i.e. \"irritable, \"\"hostile \"). Items were answered on a ve-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very). Feelings of stress was assessed with a single item: \"How stressed do you feel at the moment? \"Answers are given on a ve-point Likert scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very). Validity of single items for the assessment of stress symptoms has beenprovided previously ( 53).\"Feelings of anger \"was assessed with the item \"How angry did you get during the last 10 minutes? \" Again, items were answered on a ve-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very). Ambulatory Assessment Heart rate was assessed using ecgMove3 (movisens GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany). This sensor records Hz), 3-dimensional acceleration (63 Hz),and Hz) as raw data on internal memory.Evidence about validity and reliability to accurately capture heart rate and PA has been provided previously ( 54,55). At the end of the laboratory session, participants were asked to put on thedevice, which was worn on a textile dry electrode chest belt. For heart rate variability (HRV) analysis, two HRV subsets were calculated: (i) 10-min (linked to acute work stressduring the workday assessed viaEMA), and (ii) night HRV (following the workday). We applied the same data processing procedure for both subsets. As mentioned above, the full workday and the following night were considered for dataanalysis. Accordingly, participants became accustomed to thesensors on the rst night. In a rst step, the DataAnalyzer (movisens GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) detected sleep periodsand non-wear 56). In a second step, UnisensViewer (movisens GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany), a software for Windows, was applied to view and edit the data. Forcalculations of HRV subsets, we stored separate les based on tailored sample limits. Night HRV sample limits were based on accelerometry sleep detection and set between 8 pm and 8 am. Valid night HRV consisted of at least 4 h of detected sleep, with disruption of no more than 10 min. We assessed all participants individually todetect implausible sleep values. Sample limits for 10-min HRVare taken on the complete workdays, between 12 am to 7 pm forshift workers, and 9 am to 5 pm for workers with regular of ce shifts. Sample limits begin 10 min before the start times of eachacute work stress measurement. We calculated raw interbeat intervals using DataAnalyzer (movisens GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany). The interbeat intervals were exported to Kubiosversion 3.1.0 ( 57). Automatic threshold based artefact correction was set at 0.15 s (strong) ( 57). Frequency-domain parameters are based on Fast Fourier Transformation withSchilling et al. Stress-Buffering Effects of Cardiorespiratory Fitness Frontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org June 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 594 5frequency bands de ned in accordance with the Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North AmericanSociety of Pacing and Electrophysiology ( 58). Welch method was used to calculate spectral parameters (segments 300 seconds,50% window overlap, 5 Hz Sampling frequency). For furtheranalyses, we extracted time-domain parameter RMSSD. Statistical Analyses Descriptive statistics (M, SD, Range, Skewness, Kurtosis), group differences in outcome variables (t-test, ANOVA), and correlations (Pearson) of outcome variables (HRV night, HRVof the past 10 mi) and predictors (acute work stress, chronicwork stress, CF) were calculated using SPSS 26 (IBMCorporation, Armonk NY, USA ). For correlations, within subject variables (level 1) were aggregated over the entire day. Distributions of all variables met standards (skewness <2 and kurtosis <7) recommended for parametric testing ( 59). Univariate analysis of variance was applied to examine groupdifferences in study variables for different CF levels. Probabilitylevels of p< 0.05 were interpreted as statistically signi cant in all statistical analyses. Stress Reactivity (First Hypothesis) To examine stress-buffering effects of CF on physiological stressreactivity in acute work stress situations, multilevel modellingwas calculated with HLM 7.03 (Scienti c Software International I n c . ,L i n c o l n w o o d ,I L )f o rW i n d o w s .W ea p p l i e dt w o - l e v e lrandom intercept models. All predictor and outcome variableswere standardized (z-scores) ( 60). HRV (RMSSD), which is nested within persons (level 1), was set as an outcome. CF (6 class equivalent) was set as a predictor on the between-personlevel (level 2). First, acute work stress variables, which are nestedwithin persons (level 1), were included in both levels, with nosigni cant relations occurring. We then calculated our hypothesized model with preceding acute work stress as theassumed causal variable (level 1), CF (level 2) as moderator, and HRV (level 1) as outcome. Random variations were allowed for predictors; however, interactions were set as xed effects for causality assumptions. Outcome variables were controlled forgender, age, body mass index (BMI), shift work status, years ofservice, and PA status during the past 15 min in separatepredictor models respectively. With none of these covariates being related to the outcome, they were removed in favor of a parsimonious model. Missing data on level 2 was deleted listwiseduring calculation. First, the null model and intraclasscorrelation (ICC = t 00/(t00+s2) was calculated for the outcome variable (10-min RMSSD). Second, each predictor variable (level1: feelings of stress, feelings of anger, positive affect, negativeaffect; level 2: CF) was included in a separate model. Third, forthe between person predictor CF (level 2), four separate modelswere calculated, each including one of the four acute work stress variables as within-person pre dictor (level 1). Reported coefcients (pseudo R 2) refer to estimations with robust standard errors. Stress Recovery (Second Hypothesis) To examine stress-buffering effects of CF on physiological stressrecovery (night HRV), several (four-stage) regression analyses were performed using SPSS 26 (IBM Corporation, Armonk NY, USA). The rst stage included all demographic and social background variables, if they were signi cantly related to the HRV outcome. In the second stage, we entered occupationalstress (chronic work stress as ERI ratio and JDC ratio; feelings ofstress). Feelings of stress, originally assessed as a within-subjectvariable, was now aggregated as mean value over the entire workday. The third stage included CF. The fourth stage included an interaction between CF and each work stress variable. In thefourth stage, centered variables of occupational stress and CFwere used. We report stepwise changes in R 2with the according p-values, and the standardized regression weights with theaccording p-values for each predictor variable in the nal model. RESULTS Sample Description, Group Differences, and Bivariate Correlations Descriptive statistics are presented in Table 1 .O v e r a l l ,2 0 1 ofcers participated in the study. Participants stating current use of medication (17 participants) or employment status lowerthan 50% (11 participants) were excluded from data analysis.The remaining sample consists of 115 men (66.5%), and 58women (33.5%), mean age 37.64 years mean years at service 12.32 ( SD= 8.56). The sample was compared to the entire police corps of Basel-Stadt ( N= 980 of cers), showing = 5.69, p< no signi differences in gender ratio ( t-test compared to 29.6% women). Five participants (2.7%) did not answer any acute work stress assessments. Additionally, 13 (7.5%) acute work stress datasets TABLE 1 | Participants' distribution across the six tness groups and group characteristics in signi cantly different variables.

Following L\u00fcdtke, Trautwein, Kunter, and of the psychometric measures. ICC(1) can beinterpreted as the percentage of variance that can be accountedfor by differences between persons. ICC(1) values were 0.19 (19%) for anger, 0.45 (45%) for stress, 0.67 (67%) for positive affect, and 0.61 (61%) for negative affect. Applying ICC(1) to theSpearman Brown formula, we calculated ICC(2) to estimate theaccuracy of the mean values across all individuals. ICC(2) valueswere 0.60 (moderate) for anger, 0.84 (good) for stress, 0.93(excellent) for positive affect, and 0.91 (excellent) for negativeaffect ( 62). Missing data in night heart rate parameters occurred for 17 participants (9.8%), whereas ve (2.9%) datasets were excluded due to artefacts and in 12 cases (6.9%), sensors did notprovide data for unknown reasons. The overall mean of tness percentiles for CF was 62.93 cation recommended by the ACSM is described in Table 1. Group values and standard deviations are presented for variables in which the groups differed signi cantly. Signi cant differences occurred for gender ratio ( = 2.81, p< 0.05), body mass index ( F(5,167) = 6.13, p< 0.01), and heart rate at night ( F(5,150) = 2.45, p< 0.05). No signi cant between-group differences were found for age, shift work status, years of service,HRV parameters at night, and any acute or chronic work stress variables. Interestingly, the very poor tness group showed lower levels of heart rate at night compared to the poor and fair tness group. However, post-hoc tests did not reach signi cance (Tukey, Bonferroni). The bivariate correlations between the different study variables are presented in Table 2 . These ndings show thatCF levels (percentiles) were positively related to the aggregated mean values of HRV during the workday. The two chronic workstress questionnaires (JDC, ERI) were positively correlated with each other. While the JDC ratio was only correlated with the acute work stress measure feelings of anger, the ERI ratio wassimilarly associated with feelings of stress, feelings of anger, andnegative affect. Acute work stress parameters and the JDC ratiowere not signi cantly related to HRV outcomes. By contrast, the ERI ratio was negatively associated with night HRV. Multilevel Model to Examine Physiological Stress Reactivity (First Hypothesis) Results of the multilevel modelling are presented in Table 3 . The intraclass correlation provided evidence for a two-levelhierarchical structure, showing that 63% of variance in the outcome can be accounted for by intra-individual variables (RMSSD ICC = 0.63) ( 63). Results of multilevel models are described for CF and acute work stress (gender, age, BMI, shiftwork status, years of service, and PA during the past 15 mincontrolled for in separate models; see Methods ). In accordance with the hypothesis, a cross-level interaction for CF suggests a moderation effect, with higher levels of RMSSD being predicted by higher levels of CF when participants perceived strongerfeelings of stress. On the contrary, no interaction effectoccurred for feelings of anger, positive affect, and negativeaffect. Between-subject differences (level 2) in CF were asignicant predictor of 10-min RMSSD during the workday. The direction of the association of feelings of stress, as a within- subject (level 1) predictor, and 10-min RMSSD was negative, but not statistically signi cant. Surprisingly, 10-min RMSSD during the day was not signi cantly affected by the acute work stress measures.

ERI signi explained variance in night RMSSD. The JDC ratio of stress did not signi predict HRV. CF signicantly explained variance in participants' night RMSSD levels, after controlling for feelings of stress. Finally, the interaction terms did not signi cantly account for variance in the outcomes in any of the calculated models. DISCUSSION The aim of the present study was to examine the stress- buffering effects of cardiorespiratory tness (CF) under realistic conditions. CF signi cantly moderated physiological stress reactivity (in RMSSD) w hen participants perceived elevated feelings of stress at work, with higher levels of CFpredicting higher levels of parasympathetic activity. However,no direct effects occurred for perceived feelings of stress,feelings of anger, positive affect, or negative affect. Interestingly, the physiolog ical stress reactivity was not signi cantly affected by acute psychological work stress. Chronic work stress, measured as effort reward imbalance(ERI), was negatively related to physiological recovery at night. While CF was associated with increased physiological recovery at night, no effects on recovery appeared forinteractions between CF with chronic and acute work stress.The present pattern of results adds to the current literature inan important way, as one of the rst real-life studies examining stress-buffering effects of CF in police of cers. With these results, we add distinct insights into the in fluence emotional and affective states. Our results are novel, because the study design and statistical analys i sf u r t h e ra c c o u n t sf o ri n t r a - individual differences in the stress response. With our rst hypothesis, we expected stress-buffering effects of CF on HRV in acute work stress situations. CF showed theexpected effect when feelings of stress increased, with lowerTABLE 4 | Linear regression analyses predicting night RMSSD with occupational stress and cardiorespiratory tness.

The present results corroborate previously proposed stress-buffering effects of CF oncardiovascular stress reactivity ( 12,15,28). However, these results only appeared for feelings of stress, whereas no effectsappeared for feelings of anger, and affective states. Since affective states are understood to be less cognitively presented in stress perception, emotions might be more closely related to acute workstress ( 40). The missing effects for feelings of anger might be related to individual differences in adaptive pathways in theregulation of the stress response ( 64). As mentioned in the introduction, cognitive processes are key ingredients in the emergence of stress. Anger is linked to a cognitive appraisal (65) of causality and responsibility ( 66), for example when another person is (perceived to be) responsible for an eventwith negative consequences for oneself ( 66,67). This accountability can discriminate anger from other emotions,such as fear or anxiety, when attributions are not possible ( 67, 68). Thus, stress can even predispose an individual towards anger (65). However, accountability is, by de nition, related to higher perceived controllability and predictability of events, which arekey factors in the stress process ( 37). In line with this, Wu, Gu, Yang, and Luo ( 69) showed that anger was associated with a higher HRV (higher parasympathetic activity) compared withfear. Consequently, a relatively low reactivity to anger, compared to other emotions, would result in weaker associations, in line with the anticipated buffering effects of CF. In sum, theoreticalassumptions and evidence regarding ANS reactions encouragea differentiated, nuanced contemplation of the emotionsreferred to here ( 70,71). Furthermore, no direct effects of acute work stress appeared on HRV. This result is somewhat counterintuitive. In their systematic review, Jarczok et al. ( 72) showed that adverse psychos ocial work conditions were associated with lowered HRV. However, demands and physiological parameters re flecting cardiovascular health was not limited to the workplace. Further research is needed to further examine the influence of psychosocial stress during leisure time. While the present sample represented the overall gender ratio in the police corps, it was also signi cantly younger. Due to some promising results in older populations ( 32,74), our ndings might understate possible relevant health effects. Furthermore,police of cers have to take physical examinations in the early stages of their career; hence, relatively high CF levels can be expected among study participants. As a consequence, thedetected effects of CF as a stress-buffer might be ratherconservative in the present study. With our second hypothesis, we expected improved stress-related physiological recovery patterns (increasedparasympathetic activity in high stress levels) with higher levels of CF. Although chronic work stress (ERI) showed negative associations with night HRV, no support of stress-bufferingeffects appeared for CF. However, CF predicted improvedphysiological recovery for night RMSSD. Interestingly, chronicwork stress measured viathe JDC ratio, and acute work stress,were not related to night HRV. These results are partly in line with the ndings of two reviews ( 27,75). Loerbroks et ) partial correlations with ERI and HRV, but not JDC in the age group of 35 to 44 years. The reviewof J\u00e4rvelin-Pasanen et al. ( 27) contained ve studies assessing RMSSD. Of these studies, two studies unanimously reported lower RMSSD levels in stressed individuals. However, two studies only found partial support, whereas in one study nosignicant effect of chronic work stress on RMSSD was detected (76). Interestingly, in the real-life study by von Haaren et al. ( 28), the control group showed lower levels of night RMSSD duringthe examination period, compared to the intervention group. These previous results support the present nding, that chronic work stress is associated with reduced physiological recoveryprocesses, measured as HRV. One explanation for these results might be related to the components of the stress-health relationship ( 7). As mentioned previously, research on stress-buffering effects of CF mainly focus on physiological stress reactivity and recovery. Nevertheless, with the present paper, we want toencourage researchers to place a stronger focus on restorationprocesses in future investiga tions. The descriptions by Berntson and Cacioppo ( 7) indicate that CF might be related to improved cardiac vagal activity (parasympathetic in fluence on cardiovascular stress re activity and recovery) due to anabolic processes. These adaptations might be rather long- term, hence, health-related improvements might be lessaffected by short-term changes in stress levels. The presentstudy supports this notion, since chronic work stress levelsshowed more consistent associations with favorable HRVpatterns than acute work stress. Interestingly, CF levels did not consequently predict night HRV in all models, whereas mean levels of heart rate at night differed signi cantly between CF groups. Hence, CF might have different in fluences on heart rate and HRV ( 8,77). These differences are important to understand, since high heart rate and low HRV have beenshown to be independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease ( 33,41,78). Strengths One of the key strengths of this study is constituted by the methodological advancements in relation to previous research.With the application of real-time assessments of stress reactivity,and with the co-assessment of physiological and psychological parameters, we tackled several gaps in previous research. For instance, using EMA techniques has the potential to minimizebias related to recall times, which constitutes a huge improvement inallowing the examination of the \"experiencing self \"in contrast to the\"reflecting self \"(79). Furthermore, our statistical analyses took into account the individuality of the stress-health relationship bystatistically accounting for intra-individual changes in stress perceptions and reactions. A further strength of our study is the improved quality of night HRV assessment by including anadditional night of acclimatization. Additionally, the presentresults are based on a rigorous assessment of study variables, withstandardized, reliable, and valid tools that are widely applied inSchilling et al. Stress-Buffering Effects of Cardiorespiratory Fitness Frontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org June 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 594 9international research. The homogeneity of the present sample further allows cohort-speci c interpretations in a highly stressful occupation. Limitations However, some limitations may affect the generalizability of ourdata. First, we tested stress reactivity and recovery independently. However, some scholars suggest that these phenomena are interdependent. The \"DynAffect \"m o d e lb yK u p p e n s ,O r a v e c z , and Tuerlinckx ( 80) states that stress responses are dynamic, fluctuating around an individual's emotional \"home base. \"In this sense, reactivity and recovery are understood as the sensitivity towithdraw from, and the attractor strength that ties back to, the home base ( 80). Furthermore, Smyth, Sliwinski, Zawadzki, Scott, Conroy, Lanza ( 81) recently introduced their stress response assay that comprises both stress reactivity and recovery. The assayadditionally captures pile-up, which accounts for multiple stressresponses within a de ned time-period. Second, controlling for extraneous variables was not feasible, given the nature of our studydesign. However, using real-life stressors increases the ecological validity of our ndings. Third, although HRV assessments followed the recommendations of the Task Force of theEuropean Society of Cardiology and the North AmericanSociety of Pacing and Electrophysiology ( 58), breathing patterns and physical activity were not controlled for objectively. Toimprove the quality of subjective physical activity reports, all participants received verbal and written instructions prior to the assessments. Fourth, our results might include errors due tomultiple testing on the same dataset. With regards to theassociated effect sizes and p-values, our results must be interpreted with caution. In this respect, future observations inpolice of cers may bene t from larger sample sizes. Practical Implications Occupational stress among police of cers may have a more direct impact on society than that of other occupations, since jobperformance is closely linked to public safety ( 82). However, police of cers have been shown to be at risk for maladaptive coping strategies ( 83). Associated organizational costs are considerable due to reduced productivity, absence, and early retirement ( 84). In this respect, self-regulatory processes to manage emotions and sustain resilience are highly important(85). Self-regulatory techniques primarily aim for an ef cient systemic recalibration to physiological and psychological balanceafter intense stress experiences ( 85). Furthermore, successful recovery from stress is asso ciated with more favorable physiological stress markers, i.e. cortisol, which is evidently linked to improved functioning of higher-order cognitive tasks. Optimal brain functioning has been related to enhancements inconcentration, planning abilities, memory, decision making,moral reasoning, inhibition of inappropriate responses, andinhibition of distractions ( 85). Applying HRV biofeedback to successfully enhance coping is well-documented ( 86). Firstly, monitoring the physiological stress reaction could increas e self-awareness of stressexperiences ( 86). Secondly, speci c techniques which enhance the regulation of physiological function can be learned ( 86). These improvements in the physiological stress reaction cancomplement further psychological self-regulatory techniques(85). In the present results, partial support appeared for CF as a physiological resilience factor, helpful for managing stress in police of cers. Hence, one potential way for police health authorities to enhance self-awareness is to encourage employees to monitorday and night values of HRV. We further emphasize theimportance of interventions that focus on improved CF. Thepresent results have shown the association of increased tness and several known risk markers of cardiovascular health. CONCLUSION Our results showed partial support for the potential of CF to buffer cardiovascular reactivity when police of cers are exposed to acute work-related stress. Higher levels of CF were related toenhanced physiological recovery, which might have further important implications for participants' health. Therefore, we encourage the promotion of tness programs with the aim of enhancing CF in stressful occupations such as law enforcement.Finally, we encourage the assessment of HRV for the earlydetection of maladaptive acute physiological stress reactivity, aswell as physiological recovery related to chronic work stress.

In a one -year prospective study with a sample of 201 poli ce officers, exposure to chronic and acute work stress was examined along with physiological and psychological health parameters. PA was assessed over seven consecutive days via accelerometry, substantiated by a recently developed and validated questionnai re (SIMPAQ). CRF was objectively measured with the submaximal \u00c5strand cycling test. Chronic work stress was observed with two of the most widely applied work stress questionnaires based on the JDC model, as well as the ERI model. Acute work stress was meas ured using smartphone -based EMA of current stress experiences, whereas physiological responses were captur ed using AA of HRV . Cardiovascular risk factors (i.e. blood pressure, blood sugar, and blood lipid levels) were assessed in a laboratory setting and p sychological health outcomes via online -questionnaire (i.e. burnout, and sleep health). The first hypothesis suggested moderating effects of PA and CRF on the association between chronic work stress and cardio metabolic as well as mental health. Higher lev els of PA and CRF were suggested to be related to improved cardiometabolic and mental health, with stronger effects when levels of chronic work stress were higher. Validation studies were carried out, confirming the suitability of the applied questionnaire s assessing PA (SIMPAQ ; Publication 1 ) and burnout (SMB M; Publication 2 ). Hypothesis testing was performed using cross -sectional and prospective analyses. Cross -sectional analyses focused on the associations between chronic work stress and cardiovascular risk factors as well as mental health under the influence of PA (data not shown) and CRF ( Publication 3). The prospective data analysis focused on the associations between chronic work stress and MetS under the influence of PA and CRF (Publication 4). The s econd hypothesis of this research project addressed the CSA hypothesis. Herewith , lower physiological stress re activity and increased physiological stress recovery were assumed for individuals with higher levels of PA (results not shown), as well as CRF (P ublications 5). Physiological stress reactivity was defined as changes in HRV which were matched to the individuals' specific stress experiences. Physiological recovery was investigated by measuring HRV in the following night. The results yielded no stress -buffering effects of PA. PA was significantly and negatively correlated with MetS after one year. However, in cross -sectional and prospective regression analyses, the association as well as the interaction with chronic work stress, did not reach the level of significance. CRF only partially occurred as a stress -buffer in the cross -sectional analyses with cardiovascular risk factors as outcomes. While CRF was consistently and significantly related to lower levels of cardiovascular risk factors and MetS, no stress -buffering effect occurred on metabolic 100 syndrome in cross -sectional and prospective regression analyses. The investigation of stress reactivity and recovery in real -life yielded no stress -buffering effects of PA (data not shown). CRF was related to a more favorable stress reactivity regarding feelings of stress, whereas no effects occurred for feelings of anger, positive or negative affect. CRF showed significant associations to more favorable day and night HRV . However, CRF did not significantly pred ict night recovery in the interaction with chronic and acute work stress. The results will now be discussed in detail. Herewith, the established hypotheses will first be considered for PA, showing the relationship between chronic work stress and health und er the influence of PA. This part also includes the results on physiological stress reactivity and stress recovery related to PA. Secondly, the same order will be addressed for CRF, with a focus on the relationship between chronic work stress and health un der the influence of CRF, and the discussion of findings on stress reactivity and recovery under the influence of CRF. The results on cardiovascular risk and MetS are discussed together, due to their close relation ship. The third part integrates the result s on a conceptual level, discussing theoretical frameworks and underlying stress response models. Fourth, strengths and limitations are presented, finally followed by the conclusion and future direction. 4.1 Physical activity 4.1.1 Stress -buffering effects of physical activity The suggested stress -buffering effects of PA on the association between chronic work stress and cardiometabolic and mental (data not shown) health were not supported by the current results. The interpretation of these results is chall enging, given some inconsistencies in previous studies (Gerber & P\u00fchse, 2009) . In a prospective cohort study by Kivim\u00e4ki et al. (2002) , stress -buffering effects were examined on the basis of the ERI and JDC models. In a sample of 812 metal industry workers, car diovascular mortality risk was assessed after five and ten years. Chronic work stress showed positive associations with cardiovascular mortality. While the hazard ratios for high job strain in inactive smokers increa sed from 1.89 (0.93 to 3.81, 95% CI) to 2.20 (1.12 to 4.32, 95 % CI), these behavioral factors decreased the hazard ratios for high ERI from 2.36 (1.06 to 5.46 95% CI) to 2.18 (1.15 to 4.13, 95% CI)(Kivim\u00e4ki et al., 2002) . The authors did not further rev eal differences in smoking and PA. In a meta -analysis, Kivim\u00e4ki et al. (2013) focused on job strain and physical inactivity in the development of coronary artery disease. Results showed that, after a mean follow -up time of 7.3 years, participants with high job strain showed an incre ased hazard ratio of 1.32 (1.08 to 1.60, 95% CI) for developing 101 coronary artery disease. If participants with high job strain were physically inactive, the hazard ratio increased to 1.62 (1.20 to 2.18, 95% CI). Some inconsistencies appeared in a study by Nyberg et al. (2013). The authors examined the relationship between job strain and diabetes occurrence in pooled cross-sectional data of 47,045 participants. The authors showed that the relationship between job strain and diabetes was independent of participants' activity levels. In their review, Gerber and P\u00fchse (2009) generally supported stress-buffering effects of PA. However, support for stress-buffering effects was found in 16 of the included studies, whereas 15 studies did not show significant results. The authors further highlighted that direct effects of exercise on health factors (i.e. diabetes) might influence results as might the indirect effects of exercise on improved fitness. A review by Hamer (2012) found that PA was a stress-buffer in the development of CVD. However, the corresponding effect sizes are described as small to medium and in some cases negligible (Hamer, 2012). The author further concluded, that acute and long-term effects of PA need to be examined to account for possible interactions. Acute effects of PA are closely related to the CSA hypothesis and will, therefore, be discussed in section 4.1.2. Taken together, stress-buffering effects of PA have been examined in many studies; however, inconsistencies limit these results. Some questions remain unanswered, i.e. whether acute or long- term PA is a stress-buffer (Hamer, 2012), or if PA indirectly affects stress regulatory processes by resulting in increased levels of fitness (Gerber & P\u00fchse, 2009). 4.1.2 Physical activity and cross-stressor adap tati ons In accordance with the CSA hypothesis, influences of PA on physiologic al stress reactivity and recovery were hypothesized; however, current data did not support this presumption (results not shown). This result is in contrast to the proposed benefits of PA and exercise regarding the outcomes that represent stress reactivity of the SAM axis (Forcier et al., 2006; M\u00fccke et al., 2018). For example, Rimmele et al. (2009) applied the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) in a laboratory study and found significant stress-buffering effects of PA on HRV, with a lowered reactivity in the highly active group. A review by Hamer, Taylor, and Steptoe (2006) analyzed randomized controlled trials examining blood pressure responses to laboratory stressors. The authors concluded a dose-response relationship in support of a potential stress-buffering effect of PA and exercise on sympathetic reactivity in most of the included studies (Hamer et al., 2006). However, studies examining interaction effects of PA and stress in work stress situations are lacking (Tonello et al., 2014). Gerber and Fuchs (2018) stated that results regarding effects of PA on stress-responses are inconsistent, and that studies applying personally relevant real-life stressors are still clearly underrepresented. Support for the CSA hypothesis in a real-life context has been shown in the above mentioned randomized 102 controlled study by von Haaren et al. (2016) . The study implemented an exercise intervention in inactive university students. Von Haaren et al. (2016) showed that the inactive control group had significantly higher levels of stress reactivity and lower levels of recovery, measured as night -time HRV, during the examination period. Howe ver, these effects might be related to an improved fitness level in the intervention group. The review by Hamer (2012) suggested that supporting results for stress -buffering effects of regular PA and exercise may r elate to multiple acute effects of exercise. These acute effects might be beneficial in a post-exercise period, called post -exercise window . Frequent exercisers show a higher quantity of post -exercise windows ; therefore, they may encounter more stressors d uring time in which they still benefit from acute exercise effects. Furthermore, Hamer (2012) suggest ed that more frequent exercisers may show longer buffering states, which might be up to 12 hours for individuals exercising three times a week or more. The author further concluded that both acute and long -term effects of PA need to be considered in order to account for possible interactions (Hamer, 2012) . It was not possible to examine (multiple) acute and long -term effects of PA based on the present study design; therefore, further research is necessary to answer these questions, which have not been sufficiently addressed in previous research (Gerber & P\u00fchse, 2009; Klaperski, 2018) . The inconsistencies in the current results and remaining questions in previous research on stress -buffering effects of PA, allow for a closer look at the concept of PA. First, an interchangeable use of the terms PA and exercise is noticeable in some of the existing studies on stress -buffering effects of PA (Gerber 2009; Klaperski, one study termed the assessed stres s-buffering variable as physical activity while leisure time exercise was assessed (Rimmele et al., 2009) . Another study termed the absence of exercise as physical inactivity (Chandola et al., 2008) . However, the generally accepted (Cavill, 20 06) definition by Caspersen et al. (1985) states that PA is \"any force exerted by skeletal muscles that results in energy expenditure above resting level\" (p. 126). As stated by the American College of Sports Medicine (Ferguson, 2014) , exercise is a type of PA that consists \"of planned, structured, and repetitive bodily movement done to improve and/or maintain one or more components of physical fitness. \" (p. 2). While these concepts are apparently different, t he assessed behavior in stress research is oftentimes exercise; with interv ention studies usually influencing (strength or aerobic) exercise behavior in order to obtain (acute) p hysiological responses or (long -term) improvements of fitness levels (Klaperski, 2018) . However, the majority of health benefits related to PA (including exercise) are thought to be achie vable through regular PA in general (Pate et al., 1995). Furthermore, long -term PA, especially habitual PA, is regarded as most health enhancing (Ferguson, 2014; Klaperski, 2018; WHO, 2010) . Some of the existing st udies assessed habitual PA by elicit ing participants' behavior during the 103 previous week (Poole et al., 2011) or weekly activity levels in general (Chen, Chen, Mart\u00ednez, Etnier, & Cheng, 2019; Perchtold-Stefan, Fink, Rominger, Weiss, & Papousek, 2020). However, the assessment of habitual PA might require more complex considerations. In order to stay in the scope of this research project, habit theory will not be considered here (see Ouellette and Wood (1998), as well as Hagger (2018) for further literature). However, as noted by many scholars, PA levels can change within a few months, only by the influence of seasons (Matthews & Gump, 2002; Shephard, 2003). While some scholars advocate longer observation periods to examine true levels of regular/habitual PA (Shephard, 2003), studies assessing weekly (or daily) PA levels entail a certain risk of misinterpreting (multiple) current levels of PA as habitual (long-term) PA (Bergman, 2018). Furthermore, as highlighted by Klaperski (2018), it is possible that previous research has measured PA behavior in specific states of change (Klaperski, 2018). However, different states of change m ay indicate different demands to the organism, influencing homeostasis and allostasis (Tsatsoulis & Fountoulakis, 2006). Furthermore, while health benefits of regular PA (including exercise) are not deniable (Reiner- Henrich, Niermann, Krapf, & Woll, 2013), greatest benefits are suggested when changing from low PA levels (inactivity) to high PA levels (Myers et al., 2015). The present sample appeared to be highly active. Therefore, results may have been confounded by a ceiling effect. Furthermore, since police officers' daily work requires various tasks including different types of PA (i.e. sitting, walking, carrying load) (Irving, Orr, & Pope, 2019; Joseph, Wiley, Orr, Schram, & Dawes, 2018), their weekly PA levels have been influenced by leisure and work time. However, PA has been shown to influence health differently depending on these areas (Holtermann et al., 2010; Li, Loerbroks, & Angerer, 2013; Li & Siegrist, 2012). Whereas PA during leisure time showed associations to increased health, occupational PA has shown lower or even reversed effects (Li et al., 2013; Schmidt, Tittlbach, B\u00f6s, & Woll, 2017). This phenomenon has been termed the PA paradox by Holtermann et al. (2010; 2018). Taken together, the association between PA and health is multifaceted. A more distinct evaluation of PA and exercise levels, with regard to temporal variability (acute vs. regular) and areas (occupation vs leisure), wherein the behavior is performed, might improve the quality of assumptions and future recommendations. 4.2. Cardiorespiratory fitness 4.2.1 Stress-buffering effects of cardiorespiratory fitness 104 The hypothesized stress -buffering effects of CRF were, at least partially, supported based on the present results. CRF significantly influenced the association between chronic work stress and cardiovascular risk factors in the cross -sectional analyses . Herewith, higher levels of ERI were related to higher cardiovascular risk values, whereas higher fitness levels reduced this association. However, this result did not appear for work stress based on the JDC model, and no stress -buffering effects occurred fo r mental health. In the prospective analyses, the interaction between CRF and chronic work stress did not significantly predict MetS . These results are discussed for cardiovascular risk and MetS , followed by mental health. The fact that CRF occurred as a stress -buffer in the cross -sectional analysis is in line with previous cross -sectional, as well as longitudinal studies in university students and working adults (Brown, 1991; Gerber et al., 2013c) . Furthermore, a prospective study by Ortega et al. (2010) found significant main and interaction effects for CRF on the relationship between negative emotions and overall mortality risk after 15 years . A stress -buffering effec t of CRF on cardiometabolic health presented in a study with 5, 249 male employees by Holtermann et al. (2010) . Participants with high fitness levels had significantly lower stress -related (demands co mponent of the JDC model) risk s for ischemic heart disease and all -cause mortality when work stress was high. It is noteworthy that the mean follow -up time in this study was 30 years. Especially in regard of the stress -buffering effect of CRF on MetS. The missing stress -buffering effect of CRF in the present prospective analysis on MetS was counterintuitive. In a sample of Swedish health care workers, stress scores (single -item) were related to higher risk parameters in the low fitness group, compared to h igh fitness counterparts. CRF appeared as a stress -buffer to components of MetS , blood pressure and blood lipids in a cross - sectional study by Gerber et al. (2016) . A 5-year prospective study with police officers found significant associations between work stress (ERI and JDC models) and the occurrence of MetS (Garbarino & Magnavita, 2015) . However, cross -sectional analyses only showed significant positive associations between work stress and blood lipid levels, whereas associations with BMI, abdominal circumference, blood pressure and blood glucose remained in significant. In a cross -sectional study with police officers , Young (1994) found no stress -buffering effects of CRF on the association of work stress and blood pressure as well as high density lipoprotein cholester ol. H owever, an effect occurred on smoking, indicating stress -buffering effects of CRF via health behavior s. The current analyses did not support this assumption in regard to smoking and alcohol consumption (data not shown). A promising aspect of the pres ent results is that they indicate cardiometabolic health benefits (including MetS) related to increased levels of CRF in a highly fit sample. These results are in line 105 with previous research on the effects of general improvements in CRF (Lin et al., 2015). On behalf of the American Heart Association, Ross et al. (2016) outlined the profound evidence for such associations in favor of blood pressure, visceral adiposity, insulin sen sitivity, as well as lipid and lipoprotein profiles, which are the components of MetS (Saklayen, 2018). Similar findings have been described for the profession of law enforcement and even among young adults (Fernstr\u00f6m, Fernberg, Eliason, & Hurtig-Wennl\u00f6f, 2017; Huang, 2013; Myers et al., 2019) . The present findings provide important evidence regarding the global burden of CVD and the close link to work stress (Kivimaki & Kawachi, 2015; Russ et al., 2012; WHO, 2018) and strengthen the importance of CRF for cardiometabolic health. With regard to stress-buffering effects of CRF on mental health, the present results are, to some extent, inconsistent with previous research (Gerber & P\u00fchse, 2009; Klaperski, 2018). Klaperski (2018) showed in a recent review on laboratory studies, that physical fitness buffered the negative effects of stress on mental health in the majority of the eligible studies. However, assumed stress-buffering effects of CRF on mental health have not been supported by Ortega et al. (2010) in their prospective study (15 years mean follow-up time) with 4,888 participants. Additionally, Carmack, Boudreaux, Amaral-Melendez, Brantley, and de Moor (1999) did not find CRF to be a stress-buffer for psychological symptoms in 135 college students. As a result of their review, Gerber and P\u00fchse (2009) resumed that stress-buffering effects were more present in physical compared to psychological health outcomes. One explanation of the present results might be related to a missing significant association between CRF and mental health in the present sample. Based on previous research showing significant negative associations between CRF and mental health (Gerber et al., 2013c; Vancampfort et al., 2017), this result was somewhat unexpected. The overall health status in the present sample might have contributed to this result. In the present sam ple, prevalence rates of clinically relevant burnout symptoms (4%) and sleep complaints (7%) were considerably below the rates found in other studies (Garbarino et al., 2019; Gerber, Jonsdottir, Lindwall, & Ahlborg Jr, 2014). Furthermore, CRF levels appeared to be high in the present sample, which might confound the results by a possible ceiling effect (Collingwood, 1998). Only about 26% showed poor or very poor levels of fitness accord ing to standards by the American Coll ege of Sports Medicine (Fer guson, 2014). The vast majority showed fair to excellent (44.5%) as well as superior (30%) fitness levels. Furthermore, the present sample was significantly younger compared to the entire police corp s Basel -Stadt. However, some promising results have been shown for older populations (Clays et al., 2011; Vrijkotte, van Doornen, & de Geus, 2000). Furthermore, police officers have to take examinations of their physical and mental health in their early career, which is represented by the hig h fitness levels mentioned 106 above , and possibly biased the mental health outcomes . Taken together, the relatively fit and young sample may have entailed a possible ceiling effect . Based on previous research, stress -buffering effects of CRF are unneglectable (Gerber & P\u00fchse, 2009) ; therefore, future research in police officers is encouraged to examine older police officers specifically. 4.2.2 Cardiorespiratory fitness and cross -stress adaptations In accordance with the CSA hypot hesis , it was suggested that individuals with higher levels of CRF would show decreased physiological stress reactivity and increased physiological stress recovery. Results yielded limited support of the CSA hypothesis. In multilevel modeling, CRF signific antly influence d the sympathetic reactivity to acute feelings of stress . This influence appeared as a blunted parasympathetic withdrawal related to individual stress experiences for higher (group) levels of CRF. However, no effects app eared for feelings of anger, positive or negative affect. While CRF was related to increased physiological recovery at night , it did not significantly influence the association bet ween work stress and night recovery. Comparing these results is difficult due to the limited amou nt of evidence for the CSA hypothesis in real -life circumstances (Gerber & Fuchs, 2018) Conflicting Louhevaara, Helin, Halonen, and Hanninen (2007) . In a study with 26 teachers, perceived stress at wo rk was assessed together with HR and blood pressure. CRF, assessed via a submaximal cycle -ergometer test , was correlated with decreased stress experiences as well as lowered HR, whereas no correlation s appeared with blood pressure. However, t he above menti oned study by von Haaren et al. (2016) uniquely tested the CSA hypothesis within a 20 -week exercise intervention. University students in the treatment group increased their CRF levels and showed higher parasympathe tic activity levels (day and night HRV) during their examination period (von Haaren et al., 2016) . Results from laboratory research showed some inconsistencies regarding parasympathetic (ANS) activity as response t o stressors (Forcier et al., 2006; Jackson & Dishman, 2006) (section 1.2, page 4 ). However, these meta -analyses did not regard newer laboratory studies which were conducted during the last 15 years. Therefore, M\u00fccke et al. (2018) systematic ally review ed evidence regarding the CSA hypothesis solely based on the TSST. M\u00fccke et al. (2018) too found inconsistent evidence, with four out o f nine studies supporting the CSA hypothesis in regard to ANS reactivity. The fact that the current results only reached significance for feelings of stress , with small effect sizes, raises further questions about the underlying constructs. The c omplex as sociation between affective -emotional constructs and psychophysiological stress responses (Schlicht, Reicherz, & Kanning, 2013) in regard to the applied psychological determinants of stress is discussed above (Publication 5). Differences in the cognitive representation of moods and emotions might be responsible for a closer association between emotions and acute stress (Kasten & Fuchs, 2018) . Individual differences in brain regulatory processes in the stress response might further support different results in regard to emotions of stress against anger (Moons, Eisenberger, & Taylor, 2010). In their review and meta-analysis including healthy samples, Chida and Hamer (2008) found decreased cardiovascular reactivity related to anxiety, neuroticism or negative affect. In this respect, the current findings are consistent with results by Brondolo, Karlin, Alexander, Bobrow, and Schwartz (1999) to the extent that mood did not mediate the association between stress experiences and ANS activity. The authors presented results from a real-life study with New York traffic agents. Traffic agents' blood pressure was higher when communicating with the public compared to communication with colleagues. While mood was more negative when communicating with the public, mood did not mediate the effects on blood pressure (Brondolo et al., 1999). In their review, M\u00fccke et al. (2018) suggested that inconsistent results regarding SAM axis stress reactivity may be due to a \"range of optimal reactivity\" . While increased HRV reactivity (stronger decrease in HRV) has been related to disease outcomes, higher levels of HRV in relation to psychosocial stress are generally assumed to be more favorable (Matthews, Nelesen, & Dimsdale, 2005; Pieper et al., 2007). However, the reaction to stressors may represent vital homeostatic functions. This functionality, however, may be expressed in an adequate variation of HRV. A recent review by Turner et al. (2020) supports this assumption. The authors showed that a blunted and exaggerated stress reactivity (to laboratory stressors) was related to CVD risk factors at follow-up (mean follow up time 6.4 \u00b1 4.9 SD). Consequently, a lowered reactivity to stress might reflect poor homeostasis as well as an exaggerated reactivity (Lovallo, 2011). This assumption would further indicate that true effects might have been diminished by studies analyzing low against high HRV levels (Lovallo, 2011). This is an important issue for future research. Taken together, the present results provided limited support for the CSA hypothesis on ANS stress reactivity and no support on ANS stress recovery. While the results suggest a more differentiated view on different emotions and mood in the psychophysiological stress process, future research is encouraged to consider measures of optimal reactivity. However, CRF was related to more favorable (increased) parasympathetic activity in day and night assessments. This is important since differences in HRV have been shown to be related to CVD (Hillebrand et al., 2013) and mortality (La Rovere et al., 1998). Therefore, the present results add valuable evidence to the current literature. 4.3 Ow n empirical findings and model support As outl ined in the introducti on, the present resea rch endeavor assum ed stress-bufferi ng effects of PA and CRF. Psychophysiological mechanisms were presumed in line with the CSA hypothesis 107 108 with a sole focus on physiologic al measures related to the ANS. Under due consideration of inconsistencies in the present results, support for these models can only be given to a certain extent. In this respect the present data revealed a significant incongruence with theoretically assumed stress - buffering effects of PA. The above mentioned incons istencies in previous studies require a more distinct examination of PA. On the other hand, c urrent findings supported stress -buffering effects of CRF on improved cardiovascular risk factors (Holtermann et al., 2010) . The CSA hypothesis was (partially) supported in terms of (decreased) physiological stress -reactivity for individuals with higher levels of CRF . The CSA hypothesis was not supported for CRF in relation to stress recovery . While these results and previous studies still hold so me inconsistencies , considerations regarding the expansion or modification of t he applied model may be beneficial . The descriptions by Berntson and Cacioppo (2007) suggest at least four health influencing components: expos ure, reactivity, recovery, and restoration. While exposure is the quantitative measure of perceived stressors, reactivity and recovery are understood as the strength of a (physiological) deviation from, and the time needed to return to, an individuals' bas eline level. Restoration is a more unique and under -researched construct that considers \"anabolic processes that refresh or repair the organism, because stress may directly impede our ability to perform these functions ( i.e., disturbed sleep and impaired w ound healing)\" (p. 609). The inclusion of parameters reflecting restorative processes in the research of CSA may more appropriately account for the above mentioned theoretical assumptions of allostatic load (Williams, Smith, H.E., & Uchino, 2011) . Furthermore, in everyday life studies, the relationship between e motions, stress and health have shown to be complex and dynamic (Zautra, Affleck, Tennen, Reich, & Davis, 2005) . In the model, presented by Kuppens, Oravecz, and Tuerlinckx (2010) , individual ' stress responses (reactivity and recovery) are dynamic fluctuations around an \"emotional home base\" . In other words, reactivity is the sensitivity to withdraw from that home base, whereas recovery is the attracting strength that ties back to the home bas e (Kuppens et al., 2010) . This assumption indicates that both are highly interrelated and must be handled accordingly. In line with this , Smyth et al. (2018) recently presented a stress assay capturing reactivity, recovery, and pile -up. Pile -up accounts for multiple responses in a given time period, which further quantifies the amount of challenges on homeostasis. In order to determine the validity of these different models explaining mechanisms behind potential CSA , considerably more work will need to be done. In sum mary , partial support of stress -buffering effects and CSA hypothesis has been provi ded. Approaches that observe the theoretical model more precisely may include further stress restorative processes, and interdependent analysis of psychophysiological phenomena. In this respect, the individuality and dynamic variability of psychophysiologi cal stress responses needs to be accounted for (Shiffman et al., 2008). Combinations of EMA and AA methods offer an excellent approach to capture fine grained observations in most realistic stress experiences which are still lacking today (Gerber & Fuchs, 2018; Kamarck et al., 2005). 4.4. Strengths This work offers insights of high value, which is based on several strengths. By using the EMA and AA methodologies, the present research endeavor captured real-life data repeatedly and provided high external validity compared to previous studies. The combination of objective and subjective evidence enriches a research area that is predominantly based on retrospective self-reports (Kamarck et al., 2005). The profound assessment of psychological variables, including two of the most widely applied work stress models, was complemented by well accepted measures of cardiometabolic health. Herewith, important results are provided for an occupation reportedly at risk for high levels of psychosocial stress and CVD (G erber et al., 2010b; Hartley et al., 2011; Shane, 2010). The present study uniquely applied technological advancements in capturing psychophysiological real-life data in real-time. Sophisticated statistical models appropriately accounted for intra-individual differences in stress responses. Last but not least, the concurrent assessment of PA and CRF offers important and highly demanded insights in these interrelated, yet different constructs. 4.5 Limitations The presen t result s must be interprete d wi th cauti on, due to som e limitati ons. F irst, non- probability sampli ng entails a potenti al selection bias. Second , inconsisten t association s between the assessed chronic and acu te work stres s measure s and psychophysiologi cal health parameters lowered the likelihoo d for detecti ng stress-bufferi ng effects. The miss ing relationship regardin g chronic work stress and cardiometabolic healt h was unexpected; however, previous res earch showing strong assoc iations has often be en based on longer follow- up tim es (Garbarino & Magnavi ta, low correlati ons betwe en work stre ss based on th e JDC model and heal th related outcom es has been discussed above (Publ ication 5), implyi ng the n eed for a more critica l perspectiv e on measure s of work stress (Car ayon & Zijlst ra, 1999; Young, 1994) . While stre ss res ponses in real-li fe stres s have been presen ted before (Kamarc k et al., 2004; Zanstra & Johnst on, 2011) s howed, that perce ived dem ands were not clearly limit ed to the workplac e. Whil e studi es with spe cific real lif e stressors (i.e. exam in students ) showed high correlations with psychophysiological stress responses (Davig, Larkin, & Goodie, 2000; von Haaren et al., 2016), daily stress experiences may appear differently (Zanstra & Johnston, 2011). In order to 109 110 depict a broader range of varying stress levels, in addition to a longer follow -up period multiple measurements in leisure time and at work may be advantageous (Hynynen et al., 2011) . Third, the present sample appeared to be highly active and showed high fitness levels. Therefore, present results may contain ceiling effects. Fourth, the concurrent analysis of psychological variables may have spuriously inflated the results. How ever, for a sophisticated statistical analysis, regression models and multilevel models were applied to prevent underestimation s of standard error s. Fifth, some confounding factors have not been examined. These have been described for HPA axis activity, including brain regulatory mechanisms, inflammatory responses, and epigenetic factors ( i.e. influencing glucocorticoids) (Gerber, Puterman et al., 2010) . Additiona lly, psychological variables, such as self -control, mental toughness, and social support, might be of interest for future research projects (Bowen et al., 2014; Gerber et al., 2013a; Sonnentag & Jelden, 2009; Uchino et al., 2007) . Sixth, some studies have described the association between PA (including exercise) and stress as bidirectional (P\u00e4rkk\u00e4 et However, in the present analyses, stress -buffering effects of PA and CRF on health were tested assuming that PA and CRF determine/influence the interplay between psychosocial stress and health. To investigate potential reciprocal effects in the current investigation, exploratory cross -lagged correlations were performed between chronic work stress measures and stress -buffering variables at baseline and follow -up (data not shown). Correlations between the baseline values of stress -buffering variables and chronic work str ess at follow -up appeared to be stronger than the reciprocal correlation , which supported the assumed stress -buffering associations . In order to better understand the nature of the triangular relationship longitudinal observations with multiple measurement s are recommended (including prospective and experimental studies) (Gerber & Fuchs, 2018; Klaperski, 2018) . 111 5. Conclusion and future direct ions Psychosocial stress is a major health risk factor in modern society. While the workplace constitutes a m ain source of stress, physiological and mental hea lth impairments are manifold, well- documented , and associated costs are considerable . Promising f indings have been presented, suggesting stress -buffering effects of PA and CRF. However, evidence is conflicting to some extent and research is warranted to elaborate previous findings with a comprehensive methodology in externally valid conditions (Gerber & Fuchs, 2018) . This p roject was designed to elaborate the stress - buffering effects of PA and CRF on cardiometabolic and mental health in real life . One main goal of the current study was to detect possi ble mechanisms in evaluating CSA on psychophysiological (ANS) stress respon ses. The main finding was that CRF partially occurred as a stress -buffer on cardiovascular risk factors , whereas no effects occurred for mental health. Furthermore, no stress - buffering effects of PA appeared in the data. The second major finding was that C RF partially buffered physiologic al stress reactivity, whereas no effect occurred on physiologic al stress recovery. PA did not appear to influence physiological stress reactivity or recovery. Theoretical assumptions on stress -buffer ing effects and the CSA hypothesis were partially supported. To some extent, CRF was linked to improved mechanisms in outcomes that are c losely linked to CVD (HRV). However, future studies may benefit from more complex research models. Furthermore, it remains questionable, wheth er (cumulative) acute or regular PA (including exercise) functions as a stress -buffer (Klaperski, 2018; Ritvanen et al., 2007) . Some authors further suggest that effects are based on an interaction between these tw o and resulting fitness, which needs further examination (Hamer, 2012) . Longer follow -up periods including multiple measurements are needed for the examination of long-term effects and mechanisms of dynamic ally ch anging psychophysiological stress responses in everyday life. Therefore, a strength of the present research was the design, which accounted for intra - individual variability , and used multiple measurements of personally relevant real -life stress ors. However , future research would benefit from a more distinctive elaboration of PA, regarding differences between exercise and PA, current and habitual PA levels, as well as leisure time and occupational PA . Another stren gth of the present study is the conc urrent a ssessment of PA and CRF. Future research elaborating the differences and interactions between PA and fitness is warranted. Resulting insights might help to find appropriate recommendations and preventive measures to influence health, and perhaps, the inter action between stress and health. The present finding s must be cautiously interpreted because of the above mentioned limitations. Notwithstanding these limitations, the study has shown that, in an active and highly fit 112 sample of police officers, CRF was a reliable predictor for lowered cardio vascular risk factors , including MetS . CVDs are a global burden . The clinical importance to increase and maintain cardiometabolic health indicates the promotion of CRF for preventive reasons. The benefits would serve in dividual's well -being, but also public health purposes especially in mentally and physically demanding occupations. In the occupation of policing, health improvements resemble a societal and governmental interest. Therefore, the consistent and routine meas urement of CRF should be equally addressed in occupational health programs for police officers, as constant efforts to encourage individuals to improve and preserve CRF levels. In order to support this health behavior and credibly endorse company culture which values CRF , employers are encouraged to create training and education facilities, and incorporate them into working schedules. Health professionals might apply HRV measuring methods to examine and track an individual's health status and guide workplac e interventions in police officers, which has shown to be applicable in the present study. Albeit high levels of occupational stress were associated with more burnout symptoms, sleep complaints and increased overall psychological stress, PA and CRF did not significantly buffer these relationships. Based on these results, state and local health departments, as well as occupational health managers are encouraged to support mental health in police officers through additional efforts. 113 References Aaron, J.
