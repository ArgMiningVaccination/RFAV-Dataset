Though aromatherapy usually involves distilled essential oils, you can grow some of these common therapeutic plants in your own home and enjoy their healing properties daily! What is Aromatherapy? Aromatherapy uses scents to reduce stress, change our emotions, and foster relaxation. At a scientific level, the scents travel through the olfactory nerve into the amygdala, the emotional part of the brain, where they shift our emotions. In a personal way, we've all had these experiences, like when we wake up to the cozy scent of cinnamon oatmeal, or catch a sudden wave of refreshing lilac blossoms in the spring. These moments can easily carry us away and lift whatever burdens previously weighed on our minds. Aromatherapy distills these moments and allows us to enjoy them on demand, whether by inhaling essential oils in a bath or during a massage, or by imbibing upon the perfumes of herbs and houseplants.
