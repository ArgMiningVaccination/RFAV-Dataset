A few years back, you may have thought a natural makeup brand would pale by comparison to a conventional brand, but that's certainly not true. After testing many non-toxic brands myself, I can assure you their performance is just as amazing - if not better! Why Choose Natural (and/or organic) Makeup Brands? What we put on our skin enters the body, and we should be mindful of all the ingredients in the cosmetics we purchase. Today, the makeup industry is highly unregulated and allows for [ingredients](https://www.ewg.org/the-toxic-twelve-chemicals-and-contaminants-in-cosmetics) many other countries have banned. These ingredients include things like formaldehyde, phthalates, and parabens, all of which are linked to hormone disruption and reproductive harm. Over the past couple of years, I've tried several natural makeup brands. For some brands, I have loved the entire collection; for others, I took away a few favorite products. We all have different skin and preferences, so it's about finding what works best for you. I've compiled this list of ethical makeup brands I think are worth a try, along with some of my favorite products they offer. Plus, some of them are zero-waste, easy to refill, and all are, of course, cruelty-free.
