It's a wellness tool that holds the potential to optimize the way your body operates and feels. One of the most promising areas of research regarding chiropractic care to emerge in recent years is the connection between adjustments and the immune system. Let's begin by talking about exactly what having a healthy immune system means for you. Here's a look: - Increased ability to fight off bacteria and viruses. - The ability to recover properly and fully from sicknesses. - The ability to heal properly from injuries and wounds. - The potential to get sick less frequently. - The potential to get through sicknesses faster. The simple way to look at it is that a strong immune system allows your body to release antibodies effectively and quickly when a \"threat\" is perceived. Unfortunately, our immune systems sometimes become compromised due to a range of factors. Some people spend years trying to find out why they are living with reduced or compromised immune systems without answers. However, many people are finding a way to boost their immune systems by putting together some missing pieces of the puzzle using chiropractic care. Exploring Why Chiropractic Care Can Support the Immune System Most people have lots of questions when they hear that someone they know has been able to successfully treat an immune-response issue using chiropractic care. However, it all comes together quite easily once you take on a holistic understanding of how the body functions. The reasoning behind why we often see success in boosting the immune system through chiropractic adjustments involves the role of your nervous system in your body's ability to fight off illness. Any type of \"dysfunction\" in the body can throw off your immune system. Your immune system is essentially pushed into overdrive all of the time when something in your body is sending \"threat\" signals. It is sometimes the case that a subluxation in your spine is the cause of a serious dysfunction within your central nervous system. A subluxation is what's known as a slight misalignment within the vertebrae. Unfortunately, subluxations are rarely considered or detected when investigating issues like pain, chronic illness, mood concerns or reduced immune response. There are two reasons for this. The first is that subluxations are deceptively and frustratingly subtle. It's nearly impossible to \"pin\" the unexplained discomfort, fatigue or health issues to this particular sector of your nervous system. However, many people make the connection between physical symptoms and the presence of a subluxation once they feel the effects of a chiropractic adjustment. The second reason why subluxations often go overlooked is simply that most care providers don't know how to detect or treat them. The Role of Stress on the Immune System The really problematic thing about a spinal misalignment that is contributing to a reduced immune response is that it \"gets you\" in a number of ways. First, a block in the nervous system simply prevents blood flow and nutrient spread in a way that really compromises overall bodily performance and function. The second is that the tension that is created can place your body in a constant \"stress state.\" Being in a constant state of stress stemming from discomfort, imbalance or pressure in the body can potentially make a person more susceptible to a variety of illnesses and diseases. This is simply not an optimal way to live. The Plan You may be at a point where you're ready to explore the link between issues with your immune system and a potential \"block\" or misalignment within your spine or nervous system. The good news is that exploring the relationship between your health and your body is extremely easy to do! A chiropractor understands exactly how to detect potential sources of misalignment within your spine. In addition, issues that could be lurking in other parts of your body will also be explored. A treatment plan will be developed once it has been determined that a misalignment or imbalance of some kind could be behind tension, pain or immune issues that you've been experiencing. Treatment typically involves very strategic manipulation that allows a chiropractor to manually realign vertebra. In addition, a chiropractor may be able to use things like massage tools or imaging resources to provide full-scale, comprehensive support for managing an underlying issue. How Long Does It Take to Fix Your Immune System Using Chiropractic Care? The amount of time required to see a change in your body's immune response will vary based on a number of factors. Many patients may begin to feel healthier and more vibrant after just one session. However, a personalized program that's intended to boost the immune system typically requires several sessions spread out over a number of weeks to ensure that any misalignment is being handled gently and thoroughly. Your chiropractor may also provide you with some exercises you can complete at home that will allow you to \"boost\" your immune system between visits. This is a treatment path where consistency really can help to create a more positive outcome. In addition, it's possible that you will be able to discuss some general lifestyle and dietary habits that may help to amplify the work that is being done during each chiropractic visit. Are You Looking for a Natural Way to Strengthen Your Immune System? A strong immune system is essential for a healthy life. It's true that there are many steps we can take each day to boost our immune systems. This includes things like supplements, exercise and healthy diets. However, some people who do follow healthy practices find that they simply cannot get over a certain \"hump\" in the journey to building up a better immune system until they try chiropractic care. It's important to consider this resource if you're looking for a natural way to fight illnesses, colds and other diseases that can linger or worsen when a person's immune system is not at peak performance.
