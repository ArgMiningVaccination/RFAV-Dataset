Susan Galley, Vice President, EKOS Research EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 vii EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The Federal Initiative to Address HIV/AIDS in Canada focuses on preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS, slowing its progression, and improving th e quality of life of people living with HIV/AIDS. A s a horizontal initiative, it leverages a collaborative approach by the Public Health Agency of Canada, He alth Canada, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, and the Correctional Service of Canada, along with provincial and territorial governments, non-governm ental organizations, researchers, health care professionals, and people living with, and vulnerab le to, HIV/AIDS. In 2003 and 2006, national attitudinal surveys on HIV/AIDS were conducted as part of the Initiative in order to establish baseline measures of Canadians' awareness, knowledge, attitudes and behaviours related to HIV/AIDS. The purpose of the 2 012 HIV/AIDS Attitudinal Tracking Survey is to build on the previous research to provide an overview of how the environment has evolved since 2006. The survey also explores the attitudes, knowledge and b ehaviour of Canadians on the issue of hepatitis C t o inform the activities of the Hepatitis C Prevention , Support and Research Program. The research results will be used to provide critical evidence for the federa l response to the prevention and control of communi ty acquired infection, and support the public health f unction of preventing and controlling communicable disease by creating and sharing credible knowledge among stakeholders in order to facilitate coherent action with a focus on key populations. Evidence ga thered through this survey is intended to enhance t he capacity of community-based stakeholders to contrib ute to the prevention and control of communicable diseases in Canada. The total cost of the study is $ 153,566.62 inclusive of HST. Methodology The 2012 survey consisted of telephone interviews w ith Canadians 16 years of age and older, conducted between March 1 and May 1, 2012. A total of 2,000 Canadians were interviewed, yielding a margin of error of +/- 2.2 percent for the sample o verall, 19 times out of 20, and +/- 3.0 to 7.8 perc ent for most sub-groups that could be isolated in the analy sis. The sample included over-samples of youth (Canadians ages 16 to 24), Aboriginal Canadians, an d individuals born outside of Canada in order to analyze results from these groups in greater detail . Of the 2,000 cases sampled, 845 cases were comple ted using the EKOS Research Prob it panel of randomly selected households. The remaini ng cases were collected randomly from the public using a random d igit dial (RDD) process to select households. The sample was weighted based on 2006 Census figures av ailable from Statistics Canada. Perceived Seriousness of Diseases Compared to other diseases such as cancer, heart d isease, diabetes and obesity, HIV/AIDS is not perceived to be a particularly serious disease in Canada today. Just under half of Canadians (47 percent) say HIV/AIDS is very serious, much low er than the proportions who believe that cancer (85 percent) and heart disease (73 percent) are ver y serious. One-third of Canadians (33 percent) beli eve viii EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 that HIV/AIDS is much less of a problem in Canada t oday than it was ten years ago, which is considerab ly higher than the 21 and 23 percent who indicated thi s in 2006 and 2003. Knowledge and Awareness Knowledge regarding specific information about HIV /AIDS has waned over the last nine years. For example, most Canadians know that when a person has HIV/AIDS, their body is unable to defend itself against common illnesses and diseases like colds an d pneumonia (75 percent); however, this finding is lower than in 2006 (81 percent) and 2003 (84 percen t). Fewer Canadians know that a person can have HIV for ten or more years without developing AIDS (70 p ercent); this finding has also declined since 2003 (77 percent), although it is the same as found in 2 006. Significantly fewer Canadians think that AIDS is always fatal (43 percent, compared to 61 percent in both 2006 and 2003). Most Canadians understand tha t HIV/AIDS cannot be cured even with early treatment (73 percent) but this proportion has also declined from 81 percent in 2006. A decreasing number of Canadians are able to corre ctly identify, top of mind, some of the main ways that HIV is transmitted. Most Canadians a nswer, without prompting, that the HIV virus is spr ead through unsafe sexual intercourse between a man and a woman (63 percent, down from 76 percent in 2006) or between a man and a man (52 percent, down from 67 percent in 2006). A slight majority, 55 percent, also report that blood to blood contact (i.e., an open wound) is a way to transmit the vir us. Fewer know that both sharing drug needles (31 percen t) and unsafe oral sex (19 percent) can put a perso n at risk of contracting HIV. Some Canadians (4 perce nt unprompted and 23 percent prompted) continue to incorrectly believe that HIV can be transmitted thr ough kissing. Almost all Canadians (93 percent) understand that a blood test is required to diagnose HIV/AIDS (similar to 2006 when 96 percent believed this to be the case). Canadians are much less likel y to believe that HIV/AIDS can be diagnosed through a ph ysical examination (14 percent; similar to the 17 percent in 2006) or self-diagnosis (six percent; unchanged from 2006). Few believe an x-ray can diagnose the disease (three percent; unchanged from 2006). From a top of mind perspective, homosexual men cont inue to be identified by Canadians as the number one group most often affected by HIV/AID S (51 percent; 49 percent in 2006), followed by injection drug users (22 percent; down from 29 perc ent in 2006). Other segments such as Aboriginal peo ple, Canadian youth, those that have unprotected sex, se x trade workers, and African Canadians were named by fewer than ten percent each and generally cited in similar, though slightly lower proportions than found in the past. Twenty-six percent of Canadians were unabl e to or did not identify any specific groups at ris k, which reflects similar proportions to those found i n past years. Perceptions of Personal Risk There is still a strong perception that \"HIV/AIDS i s another person's disease\" \u2014 in other words, most Canadians believe the disease is not li kely to affect them personally. Eighty-seven percen t rate EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 ix their risk of contracting HIV as low (on par with 8 8 percent in 2006). Very few perceive themselves to be at a moderate risk of contracting the disease (11 percen t) and virtually none see themselves in a high risk category. When asked why they consider their own ri sk of contracting HIV as low, many respondents repl y that that they are married or only have one partner (58 percent). Other reasons include not using drug s (23 percent), not being sexually active (17 percent ), or always using a condom (10 percent). In terms of risk by gender, Canadians are more lik ely to see young women (51 percent; down from 57 percent in 2006) as increasingly at risk fo r HIV compared to young men (37 percent; down from 42 percent in 2006). That said, a minority of Canadi ans agree that certain specific groups are most at risk for HIV/AIDS: 21 percent believe that HIV/AIDS is m ostly a third world disease (24 percent in 2006) or a gay person's disease (14 percent; 15 percent in 2006). An increasing proportion see HIV/AIDS as mostly a d rug user's disease (13 percent; compared with 10 percen t in 2006). Sexual Behaviour As in 2003 and 2006, seventy percent of respondent s in the survey report having been sexually active in the past 12 months. Of those who were sexually active in the last 12 months, 86 per cent had had only one partner in the past 12 months (on par with the 87 percent reported in each of 2003 an d 2006). Six percent or fewer report having engaged i n sexual activity with two or more partners. Thirty- seven percent of Canadians report having been teste d for HIV (excluding testing for insurance, blood donation and participation in research), up from 27 percent in 2003 and 32 percent in 2006. A large majority (77 percent) of Canadians report not using a condom the last time they had sex. For those who used a condom, the most frequentl y cited reason was a reduction in the risk of pregnancy (47 percent, down from 62 percent in 2006 ). Thirty-nine percent said they used a condom because it was responsible to have \"safe sex\" - a n early four-fold increase from the proportion having reported this in 2006 (10 percent). The numbers of C anadians who attribute their use of a condom to wanting to reduce their chance of acquiring or tran smitting an infectious disease (22 percent), or acq uiring or transmitting HIV/AIDS in particular (17 percent) , have decreased from 2006 (37 percent and 25 perce nt, respectively). Support for People with HIV/AIDS Forty percent of Canadians know or have known someo ne with HIV/AIDS, a proportion that has remained essentially the same since 2003. Sixty percent of people who know or have known someone with HIV/AIDS believe that knowing that the person had the disease had little or no impact on their behaviour towards this person. Although Canadians b elieve that they would be highly supportive of someone with HIV/AIDS, this support weakens in more distant relationships. Almost all Canadians indica te that they would be supportive if they found out tha t a close friend had HIV/AIDS (91 percent; unchange d from 2006). Eighty-one percent would be supportive if they had an office job where a co-worker had HIV/AIDS (80 percent in 2006). Seventy percent woul d be supportive if they had a child attending schoo l with a student who had HIV/AIDS (unchanged from 200 6); nine percent would not be supportive in this x EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 situation or would avoid this person. Fewer would no t be supportive if they had a friend or co-worker w ith the illness (three and four percent, respectively). Stigma Canadians feel that stigmatizing beliefs associate d with HIV/AIDS have significant repercussions for people living with the disease. S ixty-nine percent of Canadians believe that people would be unwilling to tell others they have HIV/AIDS beca use of the stigma associated with this disease, a f inding which is similar to 2006 (72 percent). Fifty-five pe rcent believe that people living with HIV/AIDS expe rience difficulty obtaining housing, health care or employ ment (57 percent in 2006), and thirty-eight percent agree that people are unwilling to be tested for HIV as a result of the stigma associated with this disease (40 percent in 2006). Discomfort Increasing numbers of Canadians appear to be growi ng very comfortable in situations where they may encounter a person with HIV/AIDS. Large ma jorities would be comfortable working in an office with someone with the illness (81 percent), wearing a sweater previously worn by someone with HIV/AIDS (73 percent), shopping in a grocery store where the owner was known to have HIV/AIDS (75 percent), or knowing their child attends school with a student w ith HIV/AIDS (62 percent). In all of these situatio ns, the proportion that would be \"very comfortable\" has inc reased since 2006. On the other hand, many are still uncomfortable wi th the thought of certain specific situations involving more perceived direct contact with a pers on with HIV/AIDS. Forty-eight percent say that they would feel uncomfortable using a restaurant drinkin g glass once used by a person living with HIV/AIDS (relatively unchanged from 49 percent in 2006). Fift y-one percent say they would be uncomfortable if a close family member or friend dated someone with the illn ess (compared to 56 percent in 2006). Sixty percent of Canadians say that people are unc omfortable with HIV/AIDS because the disease is fatal, down considerably from 72 percent in 2006. Compared to 2006, more Canadians now say that people are uncomfortable with the disease beca use it is associated with casual or promiscuous sex (60 percent, compared to 55 percent in 2006). Over half also identify the association between HIV/AIDS and drug use (56 percent; unchanged from 2006) and the association with homosexual sex (55 percent; unchanged from 2006) as factors influencing people' s discomfort with HIV/AIDS. Forty-one percent attrib ute people's discomfort with HIV/AIDS to the fear that the disease may be transmitted through casual conta ct (an increase from 36 percent in 2006). Rights and Responsibilities of People Living with HIV/AIDS Results show that few Canadians acknowledge holdin g discriminatory beliefs about people with HIV/AIDS. Almost all Canadians believe that pe ople living with HIV/AIDS have the same right to he alth care as they do (95 percent; 96 percent in 2006). M ost also believe that people with HIV/AIDS have the EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 xi same right to housing (94 percent; 95 percent in 20 06). The vast majority also believe that people liv ing with HIV/AIDS have the same right to employment as they do (90 percent; 88 percent in 2006); however, when Canadians are asked whether individuals with HIV/AI DS should be allowed to serve in public positions s uch as hairstylists or dentists, there is broader disag reement. Twenty percent of Canadians disagree that p eople with HIV/AIDS should be allowed to serve the public in positions like hairstylists (24 percent in 2006 ), and thirty-two percent disagree that people with HIV/AI DS should be permitted to work in positions such as dentists (46 percent in 2006). Very few Canadians believe that names of people wi th HIV/AIDS should be made public so that others can avoid them, although one in ten agr ees (10 percent; unchanged from 2006). Canadians ar e considerably more divided on whether people living with HIV/AIDS should have the right to be sexually active: 55 percent agree that people with HIV/AIDS have the same right to be sexually active (an incre ase from 48 percent in 2006) but 22 percent disagree (d own from 30 percent in 2006). Large majorities of Canadians believe that people living with HIV/AIDS should shoulder the responsibility of protecting ot hers from their disease (86 percent; 88 percent in 2006) , and most believe that people with HIV/AIDS have a responsibility to tell others about their condition (79 percent; 82 percent in 2006). Information Sources Compared with results from 2006, there has been a notable shift away from the previously most common sources of information - newspapers, ma gazines, television. This shift is likely a result o f an increase in the number of Canadians who get their i nformation from the Internet and websites. Forty-one percent have found information on HIV/AIDS in the p ast year on the Internet and websites, including ne ws and health sites, as well as Google and social medi a, up from 15 percent in 2006, and nine percent in 2003. Television (31 percent) and newspaper articles (31 p ercent) still remain common sources of information, but virtually all other sources of information have bee n usurped by the widespread access and use of the Internet by Canadians. Even in-person information s ources - doctors, nurses and other health care professionals - are being accessed less often for i nformation about HIV/AIDS. Doctors were a source of information for four percent of Canadians in 2012, falling from nine percent in 2003; and nurses and o ther health care professionals were accessed by just two percent in 2012, also down from nine percent in 20 03. The Internet remains the top of mind source for Can adians when they think about where to get information on HIV/AIDS. Eighty percent of Canadian s say they would go to the Internet (in general) fo r information and 38 percent of these respondents say that they would go to Google specifically. The pervasiveness of the Internet as a top of mind info rmation source has climbed steadily since 2003, whe n 48 percent said it was their first choice when look ing for information about HIV/AIDS. After the Inter net and Google, 18 percent of Canadians say they would go t o doctors as their primary source of information ab out HIV/AIDS, if they were looking for information, whe reas only four percent have actually gone to a doct or for information about HIV/AIDS in the past year. xii EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 Reliability of and Comfort with Information Sources Canadians consider their family doctor or another health care professional to be the most reliable source for information about HIV/AIDS (85 percent; 84 percent in 2006), followed by the Publi c Health Agency of Canada (80 percent; largely unchan ged from 2006) and Health Canada (79 percent). In spite of the fact that media such as television and newspapers are some of the most frequently cited sources of information on HIV/AIDS, just 17 percent of Canadians say that the media are reliable information sources (18 percent in 2006). Family and friends are also considered to be a generally unreliable information source: only 25 percent say family and 14 percent say friends are reliable. More than half of Canadians feel comfortable seek ing information on HIV/AIDS from a variety of information sources even when they do not see th ose sources as being particularly reliable. However , the vast majority of Canadians feel comfortable seeking information on HIV/AIDS from their family doctor o r another health care professional (94 percent; 93 pe rcent in 2006) or a pharmacist (84 percent; unchang ed from 2006), which are sources that are also widely identified as being very reliable. Effective Means of Communicating with Canadians about HIV/AIDS Results indicate that Canadians are changing in th eir perceptions of the best ways to communicate messages about HIV/AIDS. The most recomm ended methods of communicating remain public service announcements on television (60 perc ent) and information brochures sent to homes (40 percent), but the number of Canadians who say t hese methods are effective has decreased significan tly from 2006 (by 13 to 17 points). These large changes may be explained by shifting preferences in favour of Internet communications channels. Thirty-six percen t of Canadians think that information on the Intern et is an effective method, and slightly fewer think that social media would be effective (32 percent). (Neit her of these was offered as an option in 2006.) Hepatitis C Thirteen percent of Canadians believe they are high ly knowledgeable about hepatitis C, while 31 percent feel they are not knowledgeable. With re spect to actual knowledge, twenty-three percent of Canadians incorrectly believe that there is a cure for the disease, and 22 percent are unsure. Half of Canadians incorrectly believe there is a vaccine av ailable to prevent someone from becoming infected w ith hepatitis C (50 percent), and 24 percent are unsure . However, most Canadians know that \"people who hav e shared a needle only once are at risk of being infe cted with the hepatitis C virus\" (85 percent), and that \"many people who have been infected with the hepati tis C virus do not know they have the disease\" (83 percent). Canadians are less certain of whether \"blood recipients are at a high risk of contractin g the hepatitis C virus\", with 44 percent believing this statement is true and 43 percent feeling this is fa lse. Eighteen percent feel it is true that \"people in my age group are more likely to become infected with the hepatitis C virus than those in other age groups\". Canadians under age 35 are more likely to believe t his than older Canadians (43 percent under age 25 and 2 5 percent between ages 25 and 35 feel this is true) . EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 xiii A majority of Canadians do not consider themselves to be at risk of contracting hepatitis C. Sixty-one percent rate their risk as low (much lowe r than the 86 percent of Canadians who consider themselves at low risk for contracting HIV). Twenty- eight percent perceive themselves to be at a modera te risk of contracting the disease and four percent in dicate they are in a high risk category. Aboriginal respondents are more likely than other Canadians to feel they are at risk for hepatitis C, with 12 per cent indicating they are at a high risk. Canadians 55 ye ars of age and older are more likely than younger Canadians to see themselves as low risk for hepatit is C. Twenty-seven percent of Canadians name injection dr ug users as a group most at risk of being infected with hepatitis C. Twenty-two percent name younger Canadians in general as an at risk gro up. Eleven percent name other drug users as being at ri sk. As with HIV awareness, where 26 percent are unable to or did not identify any specific groups a t risk of contracting HIV, 23 percent of Canadians cannot or did not identify a specific group at risk of con tracting hepatitis C. Thirty-six percent of Canadians respond, without pr ompting, that they believe the hepatitis C virus is spread through blood transfusions. Twenty-f ive percent of Canadians indicate that people becom e infected with the hepatitis C virus through unsafe sexual intercourse between a man and a woman (compared to 63 percent naming this as a method for transmitting HIV), or through sharing drug needles (23 percent, compared to 31 percent for HIV). Twenty -five percent of Canadians do not know how or did n ot provide a response to the question of how hepatitis C is transmitted. When seeking information on hepatitis C, most Cana dians would go to a source on the Internet. Sixty-two percent indicate that they woul d seek out information on hepatitis C on the Intern et (generally) and thirty-four percent would specifica lly go to Google. Doctors are noted as a main infor mation source by 35 percent of Canadians. Aboriginal Canadians Additional analysis was performed on responses fro m the 423 respondents who identify as an Aboriginal person, including First Nations living o n-reserve, First Nations living off-reserve, M\u00e9tis, and Inuit. Overall perception of seriousness of HIV/AIDS is re latively the same for Aboriginal Canadians as it is for the Canadians population overall; however, the view tha t HIV/AIDS is much less of a problem today than ten years ago is more likely to be held by Aboriginal C anadians (40 percent) compared to Canadians overall (33 percent). Aboriginal Canadians are less likely to k now that HIV/AIDS cannot be cured (78 percent, compared to 87 percent overall), and treatment for HIV/AIDS is more likely to be viewed by Aboriginal Canadians as not very effective (14 percent) compar ed to eight percent of Canadians overall who say th is. Aboriginal Canadians are more likely (21 percent) than the general Canadian population (seven percent) to name Aboriginal people as a grou p that has been particularly affected by HIV/AIDS i n Canada, and they are more likely (17 percent) than Canadians overall (11 percent) to rate their person al risk of contracting HIV as moderate. xiv EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 Aboriginal people are more likely than Canadians o verall to agree that they feel anger towards people living with HIV/AIDS (10 percent, versus fiv e percent of the rest of the general public). They a re also more likely than other Canadians to agree that they feel afraid of people living with HIV/AIDS (22 per cent, compared to 15 percent of the rest of the general p ublic) and to think that \"People who get HIV/AIDS through sex or drug use got what they deserve\" (17 percent, compared to nine percent of the general public). Although Aboriginal respondents are on par with the proportion of other respondents in the ge neral public who feel people living with HIV/AIDS should be allowed to serve in public positions such as den tists (45 percent), significantly fewer Aboriginal respon dents (46 percent) agree that people with HIV/AIDS should be allowed to serve as hairstylists (compare d to 65 percent of Canadians overall). It is also l ess likely for Aboriginal Canadians to agree that people livin g with HIV/AIDS have the same rights to employment, health care and housing (between 73 and 85 percent of Aboriginal Canadians, versus 90 percent or more Canadians overall). Between 35 and 66 percent of Aboriginal Canadians would be comfortable in situations ranging from their child attending school with anot her child known to have HIV/AIDS, to working in an office where someone has HIV/AIDS, compared to 46 to 81 pe rcent of Canadians overall who would be comfortable in these situations. Aboriginal Canadia ns would be less likely to offer support if they fo und out a close friend has HIV/AIDS (81 percent) compared to 91 percent of Canadians overall. Aboriginal Canadia ns are less likely than Canadians overall to think tha t discomfort with HIV/AIDS stems from its associati on with drug use (48 percent, versus 56 percent of Canadian s). Aboriginal Canadians are less likely than Canadian s overall to have previously gotten information about HIV/AIDS from newspaper articles (eight percent) or magazines (20 percent). Aborigin al Canadians are more likely to have gotten informatio n recently about HIV/AIDS through general advertisi ng (e.g., pamphlets) or doctors (though these proporti ons are less than 10 percent). Though the proportion is quite small, Aboriginal Canadians are more likely t han Canadians overall to have gotten information re cently about HIV/AIDS through an AIDS organization or comm unity organization (seven percent, versus two percent overall). If looking for information about HIV/AIDS, Aborigi nal Canadians are less likely than Canadians overall to search Google or go to a specific websit e, and are more likely to get information from a nu rse, hospital, or health care professional (15 percent, versus seven percent of Canadians overall). They ar e more likely than the broader public to seek out inf ormation from an AIDS or community organization (ni ne percent, versus five percent of Canadians overall). Aboriginal Canadians are more likely than Canadian s overall to be sceptical about the reliability of in formation sources like doctors, the Public Health A gency of Canada, the Government of Canada, and pharmacists; although 41 to 60 percent still judge these sources to be reliable, these figures are 54-85 percent for Canadians overall. Friends and family are more like ly to be seen by Aboriginal Canadians as unreliable sourc es of information (34 to 36 percent of Aboriginals consider these sources unreliable, compared to 18-2 3 percent of Canadians overall). It is more likely for Aboriginal Canadians than Canadians overall to feel uncomfortable about approaching their family doctor/another health professional, a pharmacist, a nd their friends for information about HIV/AIDS (23 -53 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 xv percent of Aboriginals would be comfortable with ac cessing these sources, compared to 31-79 percent of Canadians overall). The Internet is more likely to be thought of by Abo riginal Canadians (44 percent) as an effective way to reach people with information abou t HIV/AIDS than it is by Canadians overall (36 perc ent). Public education announcements in newspapers are le ss likely to be thought of as effective by Aborigin al Canadians (11 percent, versus 18 percent of Canadia ns overall). There are some apparent differences between Aborigi nal groups (First Nations living on- reserve, First Nations living off-reserve, M\u00e9tis, an d Inuit): First Nations living on-reserve and Inuit are more l ikely to be unaware of some facts about HIV/AIDS. However, First Nations living on-reserve a re more likely to feel that HIV/AIDS is a very serious disease, and to rate their personal ri sk as high. Both First Nations living on- reserve and Inuit are more likely to hold stigmatiz ing views toward people living with HIV/AIDS, and are generally less likely to be comfortable in many of the situations tested where they might encounter a person with HIV/AIDS. If they wer e looking for information on this topic, both First Nations living on-reserve and Inuit would be more likely to go to a nurse or hospital. First Nations living off-reserve and M\u00e9tis are more likely to be aware of some facts about HIV/AIDS, and they are less likely to believe it to be a disease that mainly affects drug users or the third world. M\u00e9tis are more likely to consider their personal risk of contracting the disease to be low. First Nations living off-reserve and M\u00e9t is are often more likely to be comfortable in situations where they might encounter a person with HIV/AIDS. First Nations living off-reserve and M\u00e9tis are generally more likely to feel comfort able with accessing sources that the majority of Canadians also consider to be reliable or approachable. Typology of Canadians In addition to the basic analyses cited throughout the report, a typology of Canadians was created. The typology groups Canadians into segments of people with similar knowledge levels and attitudes regarding HIV/AIDS. This typology was carr ied out using factor and cluster analysis as well a s reliability analysis. Informed Open-Minded: This segment represents the largest share of the Ca nadian population (41 percent). Members of this segment ha ve the highest knowledge, are the most comfortable with people living with HIV/AIDS, are t he least stigmatizing and are the least likely to distance themselves from the issue. They are also least likely to discriminate against someone with HIV/AIDS and least likely to believe t hat people with HIV/AIDS should have their names made public to protect others. With the same defining characteristics as found in the same segment in 2006, the current segment has grown marginally from 38 percent in 2006 to 41 percent in 2012. xvi EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 Informed Distancing: This segment comprises 20 percent of Canadians, a similar proportion as in 2006 when it represented 22 percent of the Ca nadian population. As with the first segment, members of this segment have a high level of knowledge on the topic of HIV/AIDS, but slightly lower than the Informed Open-Minded se gment. They score similarly to the rest of the country in terms of the level of stigma and dis crimination they exhibit against people with HIV/AIDS. They are marginally less comfortable than average around people with HIV/AIDS. Apart from a high level of knowledge, the key disti nguishing factor for this segment is the degree to which they see the disease as something t hat affects others (i.e., a disease affecting mostly gay people, drug users and residents of the third world). They are more likely to distance themselves from the issue of HIV/AIDS comp ared to the rest of the Canadian population. Moderately Informed Open-Minded: This group includes 23 percent of Canadians, which is similar to this segment's proportion in 2006 (22 pe rcent). They have a low to middle level of knowledge about HIV/AIDS, and are moderately comfor table about contact with people with HIV/AIDS. They also show few stigmatizing attitudes and are less likely than many other Canadians to distance themselves from the issue, di sagreeing that AIDS is a disease mostly affecting third world countries, the gay community or drug users. They are also very concerned about the issue (54 percent think it is a very seri ous problem today) and do not believe that AIDS is a less serious problem in Canada today than it was ten years ago (46 percent disagreeing). Overall, they are quite similar to th e first segment, but with a less rich understanding of HIV/AIDS. Moderately Informed Deniers/Fearful: This segment comprises 12 percent of Canadians, similar to 2006 (11 percent). The segment is charac terized by a low to mid-level knowledge about HIV/AIDS, strong levels of discomfort around people with HIV/AIDS, and the highest degree of stigmatizing attitudes. They tend to minim ize and greatly distance themselves from the issue and are most likely to support discrimina tion of people living with HIV/AIDS. Compared to the fifth group (the Uninformed Uncomfo rtable), their knowledge level is somewhat higher and their stigmatizing views toward people with HIV/AIDS are even more acute. Uninformed Uncomfortable: This segment comprises only four percent of Canadian s, similar to 2006 (seven percent). Individuals in this group are characterized by the lowest knowledge about HIV/AIDS. They also have the second highest le vel of rated discomfort around people living with HIV/AIDS. This group is likely to distan ce themselves from the issue of HIV/AIDS, believing that it is a disease found mostly in thir d world countries, and among the gay population and drug users. They express high levels of stigma and are inclined to discriminate against people living with HIV/AIDS. EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 1 1. INTRODUCTION 1.1 CONTEXT The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the virus that causes Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). The virus attacks and damages the b ody's immune and nervous systems. AIDS typically develops several years after infection with HIV (so metimes exceeding ten years). HIV is transmitted th rough several routes: having unprotected sexual intercourse with an infec ted person; sharing needles for injecting drugs with someone al ready infected; tattooing, skin piercing or acupuncture with unster ilized needles; receiving infected blood or blood products; and during pregnancy, at birth or through breastfeeding , an infected mother can pass the virus to her child 1. HIV is not transmitted through casual contact such as hugging or shaking hands, by saliva or respiratory droplets, insect bites or through conta ct with inanimate objects such as toilet seats, dri nking glasses or eating utensils 2. There is currently no vaccine to prevent the contr action of HIV and, while there are treatments, there is no cure. Furthermore, the v irus itself changes quickly, mutating and creating new strains that present challenges in treatment. The HIV/AIDS epidemic in Canada is complex and chan ging. The incidence of HIV is increasing within the more vulnerable segments of t he Canadian population, especially women, those who are marginalized by socio-economic factors, injecti on drug users, Aboriginal Canadians, and prison inm ates. Men who have sex with men (MSM) continues to be the largest single demographic represented in HIV test reports, representing 45.1 percent of positive test reports in 2008 and 48 percent of all Canadians affected by HIV/AIDS (t he latter proportion remained unchanged between 2005 and 2008). Certain subgroups of MSM co ntinue to be at considerable risk of HIV infection by engaging in risky sexual practices , such as unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) with HIV discordant partners or partners of unknown HIV status. 3 1 The Canadian Public Health Association AIDS Progr am (May, 1995).

While Aboriginal people make up 3.8 percent of the Canadian population according to the 2006 census, it is estimated that 8 percent of all HIV infections in Canada were among Aboriginal people in 2008. 4 Aboriginal Canadians are also disproportionately r epresented among injection drug users, a group that is also at high risk of exposure to HIV/AIDS. 5 Canadian women (age 15 and older) now account for a significantly larger number and proportion of people living with HIV (26.2 percent of reported HIV cases in 2008) relative to the beginning of the epidemic. Aboriginal women in part icular, as well as black women, are over- represented in HIV reports relative to women of oth er ethnic and racial backgrounds. Exposure to HIV through injection drug use accounte d for 17.7 percent of all HIV reports in Canada up to 2008. Although the literature has note d a decreasing trend in the proportion of positive HIV tests attributed to injection drug use among men, an increasing trend has been observed for women who inject drugs, according to d ata from 2003 to 2008. 6 HIV infection rates are estimated to be nearly 10 t imes higher among federal and provincial inmates in Canada than in the general population. 7 At year-end 2006, 218 people in federal correctional facilities (1.6 percent of the federal prison population) were known to be living with HIV/AIDS. The prevalence of HIV among women offender s is higher than among men in Canadian federal penitentiaries. In 2006, HIV preva lence among women offenders was 4.49% versus 1.54 percent for men. 8 In addition to the toll on human life and costs to individuals and families in Canada (and around the world), the AIDS epidemic is placing eno rmous burdens on the health-care system. The Government of Canada's commitment to a comprehensiv e and integrated response is articulated through the Federal Initiative to Address HIV/AIDS in Canada . Through this horizontal initiative, the Public Heal th Agency of Canada , Health Canada, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, and Correct ional Service of Canada collaborate with provincial and territorial governments, non-governmental organizat ions, researchers, health care professionals, and p eople living with, and vulnerable to, HIV/AIDS to prevent the spread of the disease, slow its progression, a nd improve the quality of life of people living with H IV and AIDS. The Public Health Agency of Canada is responsible for the overall coordination of the Fede ral Initiative (including joint planning, monitorin g and 4 Public Health Agency of Canada.

The Federal Initiative approach focuses on those pop ulations most affected by HIV and AIDS - people living with HIV and AIDS, gay men, Aborigi nal peoples, people who use injection drugs, people in prison, women, youth at risk, and people from count ries where HIV is endemic. The 2003 and 2006 HIV/AIDS Attitudinal Surveys esta blished baseline measures. These surveys created an overall picture of Canadians' aw areness and knowledge, their attitudes and behaviou rs related to HIV/AIDS, and isolated patterns of sub-g roup differences, including demographic and attitud inal patterns. The separate Aboriginal survey provided de tails on the awareness and knowledge, attitudes and behaviour in the four Aboriginal populations overal l and, in particular, in comparison to the general public. Research findings from the 2003 and 2006 surveys p oint to the fact that HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination persist in Canada. This is of particular concern as HIV/AIDS-related stigma a nd discrimination act as a barrier to effective preven tion, treatment, care and support programs. Stigma and discrimination can discourage people from seeking i nformation on how to protect themselves and others, from coming forward for testing and from initiating treatments. The 2012 HIV/AIDS Attitudinal Tracking Survey builds on the 2006 research to provide an ov erview of how the environment has evolved since 200 6, including a number of questions on HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination. Responses from the current survey provide critical evidence for the fe deral response to the prevention and control of com munity acquired infection, and support the public health f unction of preventing and controlling communicable disease by creating and sharing credible knowledge among stakeholders in order to facilitate coherent action with a focus on key populations. Specificall y, as part of phased programming to increase public knowledge and awareness of ways to prevent and cont rol HIV, the current evidence will enhance the capacity of community based stakeholders to contrib ute to the prevention and control of communicable diseases in Canada. The survey also generally supports the Public Healt h Agency of Canada's role in disease prevention and health promotion, with Aboriginal pe oples as a specific priority target group for focus ed initiatives. Two other key populations for the Federa l Initiative are youth and those born outside of Ca nada; results track changes in knowledge, attitudes and b ehaviour in these segments of the Canadian populati on. The past research was made available to stakeholder s and widely used within the Public Health Agency of Canada for program and policy deci sions. Given that the research was last conducted s ix years ago, there was a requirement to update the in formation in 2012 to guide prevention and control activities conducted under the Federal Initiative an d among community based stakeholders. In addition to the issue of HIV/AIDS, the survey e xplores, in a more cursory way, the attitudes, knowledge and behaviour of Canadians on the issue o f hepatitis C. Findings will inform the activities o f the Hepatitis C Prevention, Support and Research Progra m. 4 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 More specifically, the research objectives for the 2012 HIV/AIDS Attitudinal Tracking Survey include: Determining the level of awareness of the prevalenc e and seriousness of HIV/AIDS in Canada; Assessing the level of knowledge related to HIV/AID S: modes of transmission, treatment, populations most at risk, associated risk factors, etc.; Assessing the degree to which people are concerned about their perceived risk of getting HIV/AIDS; Determining the incidence of, and concern with, ris k activities that could result in HIV/AIDS; Assessing the level of tolerance and acceptance of people living with HIV/AIDS; Assessing the level of stigma and discrimination of people living with HIV/AIDS; Gaining a better understanding of why some Canadian s demonstrate discriminatory and stigmatizing attitudes towards people living with H IV/AIDS; Assessing the potential impact of increased awarene ss/knowledge of HIV/AIDS among respondents; Determining awareness of, and support for, governme nt initiatives to combat HIV/AIDS; Refining target audiences for communications and so cial marketing purposes; Establishing the media and information habits of ta rget audiences; Comparing results against benchmarks established in 2003 and 2006; and Gathering information on the knowledge, attitudes a nd behaviours of Canadians regarding hepatitis C. 1.2 METHODOLOGY The 2012 survey included a total of 2000 completed interviews with Canadians 16 and older (see Appendix A for the questionnaire). This size of sample yields a level of precision of up to +/-2.2 percent for the sample overall at a 0.05 confidence level ( i.e., 19 times out of 20) and +/-3.0 to 7.8 percent for most sub-groups that could be isolated in the analysis ( see Table 1.1). Respondents from all ten provinces w ere included in the survey sample. Respondents from the territories were also included in the sample, alth ough not examined in regional analysis because of the sm aller sample sizes in the territories. This survey a lso included an over-sample of youth between the ages o f 16 and 24, and of respondents born outside of Canada, to ensure a minimum of 300 cases in both in stances. A small set of interviews (n=20) were completed and results reviewed, including a thoroug h vetting of the audio recordings of the interviews . This EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 5 standard approach to public opinion research survey pre-testing was conducted by telephone in late February. Minor changes were made as a result of thi s testing of the questionnaire. The survey data collection was conducted from March 1 to May 1, 201 2. The interview required an average of 23 minutes t o administer, with trained, bilingual interviewers. I n order to accommodate the new questions related to hepatitis C without increasing the length of the qu estionnaire, the sample was split so that half of t he respondents were asked the hepatitis C set, but wer e asked fewer of the questions related to HIV/AIDS. Of the 2000 cases sampled, 845 cases were complete d from the EKOS Research Prob it panel of randomly selected households. These cases were co mpleted with youth (n=246), those born outside of Canada (n=144) and Aboriginal Canadians (n=206) in order to achieve oversamples of 300 cases in each o f the youth and foreign-born segments (carrying a mar gin of error of +/- 5.6 percent) and 200 within the Aboriginal segment (carrying a margin of error of 6 .5 percent)9. An additional 249 of the 2000 cases were conducted with cell phone users with no landline in order to increase the representativeness of the ov erall sample, thus better reflecting the reality of the C anadian population which is estimated to include ro ughly 13 percent who own a cell phone but no landline (an d cannot be reached through traditional telephone survey sampling methods. This sample also came from the Prob it panel. The remaining 1,207 cases were collected randomly from the public using a random d igit dial (RDD) process to select households. This w as the same process used in the recruitment of the Pro b it panel). No specific effort was made to randomize t he selection of the respondent within the household. Th e participation rate in the survey was 16 percent f or the custom RDD sample and 23 percent for the Prob it panel sample (details in Appendix B), which is rel atively high for a national public opinion survey with a qu estionnaire of this length. A comparison of the unweighted sample with 2006 Ce nsus figures from Statistics Canada suggests that there are some sources of systematic sample bias in the survey, following typical patter ns found in most general public surveys, which are con sidered to be sufficiently representative to be abl e to extrapolate from survey results to the population. These include a slight underrepresentation of men (4 6 percent versus 48 percent in the population), as we ll as an overrepresentation of older Canadians (40 percent over age 55 compared with 33 percent in the population). The sample population has a higher lev el of education overall than the general population wi th 35 percent reporting university degrees compared with 28 percent in the population. The sample underrepres ents Canadians with a college level of education (2 8 percent compared with 32 percent in the population as per 2006 Census figures), although these populat ion figures are somewhat out of date. The survey was registered with the Canadian Survey Registration Centre (CSRC). Potential respondents were also given the EKOS Research toll- free number, as well as a contact name and telephone number at the Public Health Agency of Can ada, whenever they asked for further information about the study (particularly regarding its purpose , the legitimacy of the study and individual questi ons). 9 These samples include an overlap of 165 cases found in more than one of these segments (e. g., Aboriginal and youth). 6 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 Interviews were conducted by trained interviewers at EKOS's call centres in Ottawa. Throughout the data collection, survey supervisors c ontinuously monitored interviewing to ensure consistency of questionnaire administration and int erviewing techniques. Up to eight call-backs were m ade to each member of the sample for which initial atte mpts at contact were unsuccessful. Follow-up calls w ere made on subsequent days, at varying time periods to maximize the potential for reaching a given respondent. Appointments were made for respondents wishing to reschedule a survey. Daily records were kept of all calls made, whether successful (i.e., i nterviews completed or appointments made) or not. Overall survey results were weighted in the analys is to reflect population proportions in terms of gender, age, region, and respondents born in/out side of Canada; weighting was also performed in the survey data sets generated in 2003 and 2006. Result s were also weighted for Aboriginal/non-Aboriginal status in the current data set, based on the over s ampling of Aboriginal Canadians; this oversampling was not conducted in 2003 and 2006. In the analysis of the findings 10 , a number of indices were created to represent multiple survey items (e.g., indices for knowledge and comfort). These were created with the assistance of factor analysis and were used as inde pendent variables to examine relationships with oth er items in the questionnaire. They were also used in t he creation of a multivariate typology of Canadians on the issue of HIV/AIDS (which is presented in Chapte r Eleven). In the report, the term \"youth\" describes Canadian s between the ages of 16 and 24, while the term \"senior citizens\" describes individuals who ar e 65 or over. The term Prairie Provinces refers to combined results for residents of Manitoba and Sask atchewan. Results for residents of Alberta, however , are outlined separately in the report. Results are also reported in combination for all residents of t he Atlantic Provinces (i.e., Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfou ndland and Prince Edward Island). Respondents were also asked about their ethnic origin. As only a tot al of 213 respondents reported Middle Eastern, Asia n, Latin American, Caribbean, or African descent, these were collapsed into an overall \"other\" category. This allowed for the isolation of Canadian, French, Unite d Kingdom, European, Aboriginal and \"other\". Throughout the report there is reference to people o f ethnic origins other than Canadian, United Kingdo m, European, etc. The report also refers to Canadians w ith origins in the United Kingdom, which for the purposes of this report includes England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. 10 Two statistical packages were used in the analyse s. StatXp, the companion software to the data colle ction software Interviewer, was used to create banner tables for t he analysis. SPSS was used for the segmentation ana lysis. EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 7 The following table provides the sample sizes for m ajor demographic groups used in the analysis, along with the associated margin of error for each segment. 11 Table 1.1: Major Demographic Groups (n) Margin of Error* Overall 2,000 2.2 Region British Columbia (and Yukon) 270 6.0 Alberta (and Northwest Territories) 227 6.5 Prairie Provinces 275 5.9 Ontario 534 4.2 Quebec (and Nunavut) 422 4.8 Atlantic Provinces 272 6.0 Gender Male 916 3.2 Female 1,084 3.0 Age Under 25 307 5.6 25-34 244 6.3 35-44 259 6.1 45-54 386 5.0 55-64 413 4.8 65 or older 382 5.0 Education Less than high school 715 3.7 College/Some post-secondary 556 4.2 University graduate or higher 720 3.7 Income Less than $19,999 169 7.6 $20,000-$39,999 302 5.6 $40,000-$59,999 301 5.7 $60,000-$79,999 244 6.3 $80,000-$99,999 190 7.1 $100,000-149,999 222 6.6 $150,000 or more 160 7.8 * Calculated at the 95 percent confidence level. Th at is, the overall results of the 2012 Attitudinal HIV/AIDS Tracking Survey are considered accurate to within \u00b1 2.2 percent nineteen times out of twenty. 11 The margin of error is a measure of the accuracy of the results. The margin of error indicates how f ar the survey's results can stray from the true value in the entire population (i.e., the finding will be accurate to within a certain number of percentage points 19 times out of 20), in each of the segments listed. 8 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 Results are presented in the text (in bullets) for specific segments of the sample if they are statistically and substantively different from the overall results for the entire sample. Differences in tables are noted in bold. If differences are not noted in the report it may be assumed that they are either not s tatistically significant in their variation from the overall res ult or that the difference was deemed to be substan tively too small to be noteworthy. Detailed tables of results provide responses (e.g., collapsed and uncollapsed scales) for all segments reviewed in the analysis ( along with statistical testing) and can be found in Appendix C (under separate cover). Readers should note that results for the proportio n of respondents in the sample that said either \"don't know\" or did not provide a response a re typically indicated in the graphic representatio n of the results. They are not included, however, in charts w here all responses are depicted in one bar for a nu mber of different survey items in the same chart (e.g., page 9). This is done to reduce the clutter of the c harts, although, results portrayed in the charts do not ne cessarily add to 100 percent as a result. In all ca ses the proportion of responses indicating \"don't know\" or \"no response\" is small (i.e., less than a few perce ntage points of the total number of responses). EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 9 2. PERCEIVED SERIOUSNESS OF DISEASES Comparatively speaking, hepatitis C ranks at the b ottom of the list of six diseases in terms of perceived seriousness among members of the general public. HIV/AIDS also sits low on the list compared with cancer and heart disease, and ranks below diab etes and obesity in terms of perceived seriousness. The highest proportion of Canadians (85 percent) fee ls that cancer is a very serious disease in Canada today. Seventy-three percent indicate that heart di sease is very serious. Over half of Canadians belie ve that diabetes (59 percent) and obesity (54 percent) are very serious diseases, and 47 percent of Canadians perceive HIV/AIDS as very serious. Twenty-five perce nt think that hepatitis C is very serious. While virtually no one sees cancer or heart diseas e as not at all or not very serious, there are small proportions (six and seven percent respective ly) who see diabetes and obesity as not at all or n ot very serious. Eleven percent perceive HIV to be not at a ll or not very serious and 20 percent perceive hepa titis C as not at all or not very serious. With regard to the perceived severity of HIV/AIDS, the way the question was posed in 2012 is slightly different from the way it was worded in 20 03 and 2006: in 2012, it was presented within a lis t of diseases, whereas in 2003 and 2006 it was presented alone. That said, results suggest an erosion of concern for the seriousness of HIV/AIDS, compared w ith previous years when 56 percent (2006) and 60 percent (2003) of Canadians saw it as very serio us. Similarly, in 2003 and 2006, only three and five percent rated it as not at all or not very ser ious compared with the noted11 percent in 2012. 10 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 EKOSResearch Associates Inc.

Canadians living in Quebec, those reporting lower h ousehold income, and members of visible minorities are more apt than other Canadians to rat e HIV/AIDS as very serious. Canadians with higher income and education, along w ith younger Canadians (under 35 years of age), are more likely to perceive hepatitis C as less serious compared to other Canadians. People living in Atlantic Canada are more likely th an Canadians living in other regions to rate heart disease, cancer, obesity and diabetes each as very serious. Canadians living in Quebec are least likely to beli eve that diabetes, obesity, cancer and heart disease are very serious. The propensity to feel th at diabetes is serious increases with age, with older Canadians (65 years of age and over) mor e apt than the average to say that diabetes is very serious. Members of visible minorities are also more apt to see obesity as very serious compared with other Canadians. EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 11 3. KNOWLEDGE AND AWARENESS REGARDING HIV/AIDS Most Canadians know that \"when a person has HIV/AI DS, their body is unable to defend itself against common illnesses and diseases like colds an d pneumonia\" (75 percent); only nine percent disagr ee with this statement. This knowledge level is lower t han that found in 2006 (81 percent) and 2003 (84 percent). Seventy percent of Canadians know tha t a person can have HIV for ten or more years witho ut developing AIDS. This is the same level of knowledge as 2006, but lower than 2003 when 77 percent agreed with the statement. Considerably fewer Canad ians agree that \"AIDS is always fatal\" (43 percent) , compared to 2003 and 2006 (61 percent agreed each y ear). EKOSResearch Associates Inc. HIV/AIDS Awareness Survey, April 2012 General Knowledge 41 89 11 12 10 43 70 75 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% (%) Agree (5-7) (%) \"Rate the extent to which you agree or disagree with the following\" When a person has HIV/AIDS, his or her body cannot defend itself against common illnesses and diseases, such as colds and pn eumonia A person can have HIV for ten years or more without developing AIDS AIDS is always fatal (n=968) 2006 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 Canadians with higher incomes more often agree that the body cannot defend itself against common illnesses and diseases with HIV/AIDS than th ose with lower income. Seniors are less likely than other Canadians to know that immunity i s compromised with HIV/AIDS, although 68 percent are aware of this. Canadians with higher incomes and education, as wel l as limited or no religious association, are more likely than other Canadians to believe tha t a person can have HIV for ten years or more without developing AIDS. Knowledge is lowest a mong the youngest and oldest Canadians (under age 25 or 65 years old and over). Respondents who were born outside of Canada are les s likely than those born in Canada to believe that a person can have HIV for ten years or more without developing AIDS. This is also the case with those who identify their ethnic origi n as being something other than Canadian, European, or Aboriginal. Canadians living in Quebec are more likely than Can adians living in other provinces to believe that AIDS is always fatal. Residents of Ontario and British Columbia, those with higher incomes, a university education, men, and older res pondents (55 years of age or older) are least likely to agree compared with their counterpa rts. Those who cite their ethnic origin as UK or European, along with those with limited or no re ligious association, are also more apt than average to say that AIDS is not always fatal. The perception that AIDS is always fatal is correlat ed with the perceived seriousness of HIV/AIDS (as well as hepatitis C). EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 13 By and large, Canadians are aware that there is no cure for HIV/AIDS. Eighty-seven percent know that HIV/AIDS cannot be cured. Seventy-three p ercent say that HIV/AIDS cannot be cured when asked in the context of \"early treatment\". So, whil e most realize that there is no cure, many nonethel ess believe that, with appropriate treatment, AIDS is n ot always fatal. This is largely in line with result s from 2006 (i.e., nine percent versus eight in 2006 for \" cured\", although not measured in 2003; 19 percent versus15 percent in 2006 and 17 percent in 2003). EKOSResearch Associates Inc. HIV/AIDS Awareness Survey, April 2012 Other Knowledge \"Can it Be Cured?\" \"To the best of your knowledge, can HIV/AIDS be Yes Cured if treated early 17% n=995 n=1005 2003 Yes n=1001 8% 2003 NA n=2004 Canadians 65 years old and over are marginally more likely than those under 65 years of age to believe that HIV/AIDS can be cured, or cured if treated early. Those between the ages of 25 and 44, along with those with higher education, are more likely than others to know that HIV/AIDS cannot be cured. Aboriginal Canadians are more likely than the avera ge to believe that HIV/AIDS can be cured (19 percent). Those with the least education and income are more l ikely to believe that HIV/AIDS can be cured if treated early compared to those with highe r income and education. People with a disability are also more likely than the average to believe this (32 percent). 14 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 3.1 TRANSMISSION AND DIAGNOSIS OF HIV/AIDS The actual factors associated with the highest risk of HIV infection include the exchange of bodily fluids during unprotected anal or vaginal in tercourse (no use of a condom), or through blood to blood contact such as through the sharing of drug-use equ ipment, particularly needles or syringes used for injecting drugs. HIV can also be transmitted from a pregnant mother to her child before, during, or af ter giving birth. People from populations in Canada mor e adversely affected by HIV (e.g., men who have sex with men, injection drug users) are at an increased risk for exposure due to higher prevalence rates i n these populations. For the most part, Canadians are able to correctly identify one or more of the modes of transmission of HIV. Most Canadians answer, without prompting, that HIV is spread through unsafe/unprotected intercourse between a man and a woman (63 percent, down from 76 percent in 2006) or between a man and a man (52 percent, down from 67 p ercent in 2006). In 2003, unprompted, 84 percent cited unsafe/unprotected intercourse in general as a method of transmission. In 2012, 55 percent say t hat blood to blood contact (i.e., an open wound) is a w ay to transmit the virus, consistent with 2006. Thir ty- one percent say that sharing drug needles is a mode of transmission (down marginally from 35 percent i n 2006 and down from 45 percent in 2003). Without pro mpting, small segments of Canadians also name bodily fluid transfer (11 percent) and from mother to child during pregnancy (three percent) as method s of transmitting HIV. Although unsafe/unprotected oral sex presents negl igible (low, but not zero) risk, twenty percent of Canadians say this can put a person at r isk of contracting HIV (unchanged from 2006). Kissi ng, which poses no risk for HIV transmission, was ident ified by four percent of respondents. While 35 perc ent of respondents in 2003 mentioned blood transfusions as a cause of HIV infection and six percent mentioned this in 2006, no respondents cited this in 2012 12 . Since blood screening for HIV began in November 1 985, transfusions and transplants are considered low ris k. Four percent do not know or did not provide a response regarding how HIV is transmitted. 12 There was considerable media coverage of blood tr ansfusions and tainted blood in this period of time , possibly driving these results - or is it because blood/blood products have been scr eened for 25+ years?

Canadians are much l ess likely to believe that HIV/AIDS can be diagnose d through a physical examination (14 percent) or self -diagnosis (six percent). The perception that a phys ical examination can be used to diagnose HIV/AIDS has de creased from 27 percent in 2003, but is similar to the 17 percent found in 2006. As in past years, three p ercent believe an x-ray can be used to diagnose HIV/AIDS. 13 In the tables of detailed results by demographic group, proportions and means are presented in bold if they are statistically higher than the rest of the sample.

Nine percent of people living in Quebec think someone can find out if they have HIV/AIDS from self-diagnosis, and 26 percent say this can be found out through a phys ical examination. Six percent of Canadians with no post-secondary edu cation, and nine percent of Canadians with annual household incomes under $40,000, believ e an x-ray can be used to tell for certain if someone has HIV/AIDS. Ten percent of those with n o post-secondary education, and nine percent of Canadians with annual household inc omes under $40,000, believe self- diagnosis can be used to determine if someone has H IV/AIDS. Nineteen percent of people with no post-secondary education, 22 percent of tho se with incomes under $20,000, and 18 percent of those with incomes between $20,00 and 40 ,000 think HIV/AIDS can be detected through a physical examination.

Injection drug users as a group are named by 22 percent, which is lower tha n found in the past (31 percent in 2003 and 29 percen t in 2006). Other populations, such as Aboriginal p eople, Canadian youth (under 25 years of age), people who have unprotected sex, sex trade workers, and people of African descent were named by fewer than ten per cent each and generally cited in similar, if slight ly lower, proportions than found in the past. Twenty-si x percent were unable to identify any specific grou ps at risk or did not respond, which reflects similar pro portions to those found in past years. EKOSResearch Associates Inc.

Cana dians between the ages of 45 and 64 are more likely than those under age 35 or over 65 years of age to identify homosexual men as a group most affected by HIV/AIDS. Education is a strong determinant of the groups ide ntified as affected by HIV/AIDS. Those with a university education are considerably more likely to cite injection drug users (26 percent) and homosexual men (59 percent) as examples of groups m ost affected by HIV/AIDS compared to those with a college education. This drops considera bly among those with only a high school education (15 percent cited injection drug users an d 39 percent cited homosexual men). Those who identify their ethnic origin as being some thing other than from the UK or Europe are less likely than other Canadians to cite inject ion drug users or homosexual men as a group most affected by HIV/AIDS. Aboriginal people are much more likely than other C anadians to indicate that Aboriginal people are a group in the Canadian population that have be en most affected by HIV/AIDS (21 percent). 3.3 KNOWLEDGE INDEX A summary measure was created of the items that re flect respondents' knowledge of HIV/AIDS, creating an index of Canadians' knowledge regarding HIV/AIDS. The index included knowledge and misconceptions of methods of HIV transmission: unsafe/unprotected intercourse between a man and a man; unsafe/unprotected intercourse between a man and a sex; sharing drug needles; kissing; tattoos/body piercing; contact with physical objects such as fountains or toilet seats; 14 As was the case in 2003 and 2006, this finding ma y be related, in part, to the higher incidence of i njection drug use on the lower Eastside of Vancouver. EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 21 blood to blood contact, such as from an open cut; mosquito bites; casual contact such as hugging or shaking hands; a sneeze or cough; and from mother to child during pregnancy; It also included knowledge and misconceptions of m ethods for detecting HIV (blood test; physical examination, self-diagnosis; x-ray; or oth er), and responses to the following agree/disagree statements: HIV/AIDS can be cured/cured if treated early; a person can have HIV for ten years or more without developing AIDS; and when a person has HIV/AIDS, his or her body cannot defend itself against common illnesses and diseases, such as colds and pneumonia. 22 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 Each correct answer earned a point and each incorr ect deducted a point. The scores were then summed up and categorized and then collapsed i nto categories of high, medium and low levels of knowledge. The overall results indicate that 19 perc ent of Canadians have low levels of knowledge, 42 percent have moderate knowledge and 39 percent h ave high levels of knowledge, similar to 2006 resul ts. EKOSResearch Associates Inc. knowledge (8-10) Medium knowledge (5-7) Low knowledge with the individual items related to knowledge, the overall knowledge scores are lower among those with the least education and income, as well as among the oldest Canadians, those born outside of Canada, visible minorities an d people with disabilities. This is also true of Canadians reporting the strongest religious associa tions. Knowledge scores are also slightly lower among men versus women. EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 23 3.4 PERSONAL PERCEPTION OF KNOWLEDGE (S ELF -RATED ) Irrespective of what they actually do know based o n the results of several knowledge measures in the survey, Canadians generally believe that they are moderately knowledgeable about HIV/AIDS. Few report that they know little about the disease. Compared with 2003 and 2006, fewer Canadians in 2012 rate themselves as highly knowled geable, although differences are marginal. Twenty- two percent report themselves to be highly knowledg eable about HIV/AIDS, which is a lower knowledge level than that reported in 2006, but similar to 20 03 results. EKOSResearch Associates Inc. HIV/AIDS Awareness Survey, April 2012 Self-Rated Knowledge \"How knowledgeable would you say that in Quebec are more likely to repor t themselves to be knowledgeable about HIV/AIDS than those in other parts of the country: 32 percent of Quebec residents believe they are very knowledgeable about HIV/AIDS, rating thems elves with a six or seven on the scale. This is in contrast to the lower scores reported by Quebec residents on other knowledge measures in the survey. Canadians with university education or higher, and those with high incomes ($100,000 to $150,000) are more likely to report they are knowle dgeable about HIV/AIDS (24 percent) as compared to those with high school education or les s (17 percent). Members of visible minorities, as well as those who report themselves to be gay, lesbian, transgender or bisexual also rate themselves as having high knowledge regar ding HIV/AIDS. 24 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 The reported knowledge levels of seniors is lower th an found among other Canadians on the issue of HIV/AIDS (18 percent rate themselves as \"n ot knowledgeable\"). Reported knowledge levels of Canadians living in Alberta are also lowe r than found among residents of other provinces. EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 25 4. DISTANCING , RISK , AND TREATMENT FOR HIV/AIDS 4.1 DISTANCING FROM HIV/AIDS Several items were included in the survey to measu re the extent to which Canadians see HIV/AIDS as a problem that only affects others, rat her than a disease that can infect anyone. Results indicate a reduction in the extent to which Canadia ns see HIV/AIDS as a disease mostly affecting other s: 21 percent agree that \"HIV/AIDS is mostly a third w orld disease\", which is down from 28 percent in 200 3, but similar to the 24 percent found in 2006. Slight ly fewer believe that it is \"mostly a gay person's disease\" (down from 19 percent in 2003, but the same as the 15 percent found in 2006). Thirteen percent agree t hat HIV/AIDS is \"mostly a drug user's disease\", which i s also similar to previous results (10 and 15 perce nt in 2006 and 2003, respectively). EKOSResearch Associates Inc.

Canadians living in Quebec are more likely than peo ple living in other provinces to see HIV/AIDS as mostly a gay person's disease or a thir d world disease. Canadians reporting the least education and income are also more apt to agree with these statements relative to those with higher socioecono mic status. Canadians who know a person living with HIV/AIDS ar e less likely to agree that HIV/AIDS is a third world disease or a drug user's disease than t hose who do not know someone with HIV/AIDS. 4.2 DISTANCING INDEX Another summary measure was created to reflect the extent to which respondents see HIV/AIDS as a disease affecting others or only very specific groups, rather than a disease that is of concern to themselves or to the general public in Canada. T he index includes agreement or disagreement with th e following statements: HIV/AIDS is mostly a gay person's disease; HIV/AIDS is mostly a drug user's disease; and, HIV/AIDS is mostly a third world disease. EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 27 An average score for the three items was calculate d on a 7-point scale for each respondent. Results were then collapsed into categories of high , medium and low likelihood of distancing from HIV/ AIDS. Fifty-two percent of Canadians scored low, meaning t hey do not agree that HIV/AIDS is a disease that mostly affects others. Thirty-five percent agree to a moderate degree that HIV/AIDS is a disease that m ostly affects others, and the remaining 14 percent agree to a large degree that HIV/AIDS is a disease that m ostly affects others. These results line up precisely with the results from 2006. EKOSResearch Associates Inc. HIV/AIDS Awareness Survey, April which Canadians distance themselves from HIV/AIDS Low distancing (1-2.4) Medium distancing (2.5-4.4) 2006 34% 14% 51% n=2036 n=2000 Seniors are more apt to agree that HIV/AIDS is a di sease that affects others. This is in line with their lower knowledge levels and lower self-re ported knowledge of HIV/AIDS. Canadians with higher incomes and education levels are less apt than the average to agree that HIV/AIDS affects mostly others, as are members of visible minorities and Aboriginal people, relative to other Canadians. Canadians with a disability are more apt to agree that HIV/AIDS occurs to mostly other groups, as are thos e with stronger religious association. Those who consider themselves to be at low risk of c ontracting HIV/AIDS, as well as those who know someone with AIDS, are less apt than the a verage to agree that HIV/AIDS affects mostly others, as are those with high actual and se lf-rated knowledge scores. 28 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 4.3 PERCEPTION OF RISK Thirty-three percent of Canadians believe that HIV/ AIDS is much less of a problem in Canada today than it was ten years ago, which is considera bly higher than the 21 and 23 percent in 2006 and 2 003. Canadians are more likely to see young women (51 pe rcent) as increasingly at risk for HIV than are you ng men (37 percent). Compared with previous years, few er Canadians see HIV as increasingly risky for both genders. EKOSResearch Associates Inc.

People living in Quebec are much more likely than o ther Canadians to disagree with the statements: HIV/AIDS is much less of a problem toda y than it was ten years ago (58 percent compared with the national average of 39 percent). In other words, Canadians living in Quebec are less apt to see HIV/AIDS as a problem th at is diminishing over time. Canadians living in the Atlantic provinces and thos e living in British Columbia are more likely to agree that young women in Canada are increasingl y at risk of contracting HIV (59 percent each); Canadians living in Quebec are least likely to agree (45 percent) along with those identifying an ethnic origin other than Canadian, E uropean, or Aboriginal (42 percent agree), relative to other Canadians. Those with lower education and income are more apt t han other Canadians to believe that young men are increasingly at risk for HIV. EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 29 As in 2003 and 2006, the majority of Canadians do not consider themselves to be personally at risk of contracting HIV: 87 percent rate their r isk as low. Eleven percent perceive themselves to b e at a moderate risk of contracting the disease, and one p ercent believes themselves to be at a high risk of contracting HIV/AIDS. EKOSResearch Associates Inc. HIV/AIDS Awareness Survey, April 2012 Perception of Personal Risk \"How would you rate your own personal risk RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 Table 4.1: Perceptions of Personal Risk by Demographic Variables \"How would you rate your own personal risk of contr acting HIV, using a scale where 1 is a very low ris k, 7 is a very high risk, and the midpoint 4 is moderate risk?\" (n =2,000) Low Risk (1,2) (%) Moderate Risk (3,4,5) (%) High Risk (6,7) (%) Overall 87 11 1 Age (in years) <25 75 22 2 25-34 82 14 3 35-44 84 14 2 45-54 91 8 1 55-64 93 6 0 65+ 92 5 1 Casual Partners Yes 68 27 3 No 93 6 1 Perceived risk of contracting HIV is higher among y outh (22 percent report themselves to be at moderate risk). This is likely linked to the fact th at youth also report the highest incidence of casual and multiple sexual partners. Perceived risk is higher among Canadians living in Quebec relative to the perceived risk reported by Canadians living elsewhere in Canada (1 9 percent rating themselves as having a moderate risk). Twenty-seven percent of those identifying themselves as gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender report a moderate risk while six percent say their risk is high. Those with casual partners report a considerably hig her perceived risk than those with only one or no sexual partners: three percent believe th ey are at a high risk and 27 percent say that they are at a moderate risk. When asked why they consider their own personal ri sk of contracting HIV as low, many report their marital status (married), or that they only h ave one partner (58 percent) as their primary reaso n. Other reasons include not using drugs (23 percent), not b eing sexually active (17 percent), or always using a condom (10 percent). Three percent did not provide a reason for their perception of low personal risk. These results are very similar to those found in 2006.

A top response for this s egment is also that they work in an industry where there may be some work-related risk (e.g., health care, d ental profession) (20 percent) or that one simply n ever knows what might happen (11 percent). Those perceiving themselves to be at high risk poin t mostly to their profession (e.g., health care, dental) (32 percent) or that they have multip le partners (17 percent) as their main reasons for this perception. Twenty-eight percent did not provide a r esponse or said that they did not know. EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 33 4.4 PERCEIVED EFFECTIVENESS OF TREATMENTS FOR HIV/AIDS Eighty-three percent of Canadians in 2012 believe HIV/AIDS treatments are somewhat or very effective in helping people with the disease lead n ormal lives. This is a slightly higher proportion th an found in 2003 or 2006, although results have moved more t owards the \"very effective\" category from the \"somewhat effective\" category compared with finding s from 2003 or 2006. This finding is consistent with the finding that many feel/believe the disease is not f atal. Ten percent believe treatments are not very or not at all effective, which is slightly lower than past re sults. EKOSResearch Associates Inc. HIV/AIDS Awareness Survey, April Not very effective Don't know/no response \"How effective do you believe that HIV/AIDS treatmen ts are in helping people with the disease lead normal lives? Would you say t hey are...\" Not at all living in Quebec are significantly more l ikely than other Canadians to say that HIV/AIDS treatments are not effective (23 percent) in helping people with the disease lead normal lives; this view is shared by ten percent of residents or fewer elsewhere in Canada. Youth are somewhat more likely to believe that trea tments are not effective (15 percent). On the other hand, people living in British Columbi a, the most educated and affluent, and people who know someone with HIV/AIDS are more like ly than other Canadians to believe that treatments are highly effective. EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 35 5. SEXUAL BEHAVIOUR Seventy percent of Canadians report having been se xually active in the past 12 months. This is largely the same result as that found in 2003 an d 2006. Of those who are sexually active, 86 percen t have had only one partner in the past 12 months, identic al to 2003 and 2006 findings. Six percent report tw o partners, as was the case in 2003 and 2006. The rema ining seven percent report having engaged in sexual activity with two or more partners (also similar to past results).

This strong relationship betw een sexual activity and age is likely driven by the strong relationship between marital status a nd age (with those between ages 35 and 44 years being most likely to be in married or common law relationships). There are also significant relationships between sexual activity a nd a number of other variables including income, and presence of children in the home. This i s largely because there are strong relationships between age and income, as well as ag e and presence of children, etc. Therefore, the relationship between sexual activity and age carries through to these other dimensions (e.g., age and income). Although youth are less apt to be sexually active; if they are, they are considerably more likely to have multiple partners than their older counterp arts. 38 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 Fifteen percent of Canadians who are sexually activ e report that they had one or more casual sexual partner in the past year. This is also simila r to the result found in 2006 (12 percent). EKOSResearch Associates Inc.

EKOSResearch Associates Inc. HIV/AIDS Awareness Survey, April 2012 Testing Behaviour \"Have you ever been tested for HIV, excluding testi ng for insurance, blood donation and participation in Yes No Don't know/no response Canadians between the ages of 25 to 44 years are mo re likely to have ever been tested for HIV (52 to 58 percent), while those 55 years of age and older are least likely to have been tested, reflecting the pattern of lower sexual acti vity. The reported incidence of testing is higher in Quebe c than elsewhere in Canada. Canadians who know someone with HIV, who are sexual ly active, and who report having casual sexual partners are all more likely to have been tested for HIV in the past. Respondents who identified themselves as lesbian, g ay, bisexual, or transgender are significantly more likely to have been tested for H IV (66 percent compared with the national average of 37 percent). 40 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 5.1 SAFER SEX Twenty-one percent of sexually active Canadians use d a condom the last time they had sex, which is largely on par with results found in 2006 (23 percent).

Co mpared with 2006 results, \"to reduce the risk of pregnancy\" and \"to reduce the risk of catching an i nfectious disease or HIV/AIDS specifically\" are all cited considerably less frequently in 2012. The incidence of Canadians attributing condom use to safer sex practices is considerably higher in 2012 (39 percen t compared with 10 percent in 2006 15 ). EKOSResearch Associates Inc.

Three percent did not use a condom because they were trying to get pregnant, and another three perc ent said they were using the birth control pill or another mode of contraception.

The same pattern holds among people born outside Canada and Europe who identify as a visible minority, as well as among those with strong religious associations, and people who self- rate their knowledge of HIV/AIDS as low relative to other Canadians. People who believe their chances of contracting HIV /AIDS are high and who do not know a person with HIV/AIDS are more likely to agree that people who contract HIV/AIDS through drug use or sex got what they deserve.

Seventy-three percent disagree that they \"feel afraid of people living with HIV/AIDS\", and 1 5 percent agree that they do feel afraid. Eighty-fi ve percent of Canadians disagree with the statement, \"I could not be friends with someone who has HIV/AIDS,\" whil e nine percent agree with this sentiment. People living in Quebec are more likely than other Canadians to agree that they feel anger (10 percent) and fear (23 percent) toward people with H IV/AIDS. People living in B.C. are less likely to agree that they feel afraid of people liv ing with HIV/AIDS. Canadians of higher socio-economic status (higher i ncomes and education) are more likely to disagree that they feel anger or fear toward people living with HIV/AIDS, or that they could not be friends with someone who has HIV/AIDS. People born outside of Canada are more likely to ag ree that they feel fear toward people living with HIV/AIDS. This is also true for those identifyi ng as a visible minority and having an ethnic background other than Canadian, U.K., European or A boriginal. People identifying as having a disability are more likely than the average to say that they could not be friends with someone who has HIV/AIDS. The sa me is also true for seniors. People who identify as having an ethnic background other than Canadian, European, U.K., French or Aboriginal are more likely than the averag e to say that they could not be friends with someone who has HIV/AIDS. 48 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 People who consider themselves at high risk for con tracting HIV are more likely to say they could not be friends with a person who has HIV/AIDS (25 percent), compared to those who consider themselves low risk (eight percent). 6.2 STIGMA INDEX Several variables were combined to create a summar y or index measuring the level of stigma Canadians direct towards people living with HIV/AID S. These variables include: Extent to which Canadians feel that they could beco me or remain friends with someone with HIV/AIDS; Extent to which Canadians agree that people who con tract HIV/AIDS through sex or drug use got what they deserve and that people living with H IV/AIDS have only themselves to blame; and Extent to which Canadians feel fear of people livin g with HIV/AIDS. 16 16 This set of variables was combined on the basis o f a factor analysis indicating that these measures were answered in similar ways. Other items in the battery did not load into the summary measure with the same degree of reliability. EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 49 Results of this summary show that 71 percent of Ca nadians have little tendency to stigmatize people living with HIV/AIDS, although 22 percent ho ld a moderate degree of stigma towards people with HIV/AIDS, and another seven percent exhibit a high level of stigma. These results are largely stable fr om 2006. EKOSResearch Associates Inc. HIV/AIDS Awareness Survey, stigma Canadians direct towards people liv ing with HIV/AIDS Low stigma 20% 7% 64% n=2036 n=2000 Findings related to stigma towards people with HIV/A IDS show that women, Canadians with post-secondary education or higher incomes, those w ith high levels of self-rated knowledge on the topic of HIV/AIDS, and those who have known som eone with HIV/AIDS are less likely to hold stigmatizing attitudes towards people living w ith HIV/AIDS compared with other Canadians. Residents of Ontario and the Atlantic pr ovinces also hold the lowest stigmatizing scores of all Canadians. Senior citizens are far more stigmatizing towards p ersons living with HIV/AIDS than are Canadians under 65 years of age. Canadians with str onger religious association (who also tend to be older) and those born outside Canada, as well as members of visible minorities are more likely than other Canadians to demonstrate sti gmatizing attitudes towards people living with HIV/AIDS. This is also true of Canadians living in Quebec relative to other Canadians. People who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual or tr ansgender are least apt to hold stigmatizing views toward people with HIV/AIDS compared with the national average. Canadians with stronger religious association are a lso the most apt to hold stigmatizing points of view compared with those who report limited reli gious association (e.g., 23 percent with limited religious association have high stigma scor es compared with 41 percent of those reporting a strong religious association). 50 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 6.3 PERCEIVED REPERCUSSIONS OF HIV/AIDS-R ELATED STIGMA Sixty-nine percent of Canadians believe that peopl e would not be willing to tell others they have HIV/AIDS because of the stigma associated with this disease, which is similar to findings from 20 06 (72 percent). Fifty-five percent of Canadians believ e that people living with HIV/AIDS can experience difficulty obtaining housing, health care and emplo yment because of the stigma associated with this disease, unchanged from 2006 (57 percent). Thirty-ei ght percent agree that people are unwilling to be tested for HIV as a result of the stigma associated with this disease, similar to 2006 (40 percent). EKOSResearch Associates Inc.

Conversely, people living in Bri tish Columbia are more likely to feel that people living with HIV/AIDS experience difficulty o btaining housing, health care or employment. Women and people with the strongest religious assoc iation are more likely than their counterparts to agree that people living with HIV/A IDS experience all three repercussions as a result of the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS. Canadians who perceive HIV/AIDS to be a serious pro blem more often disagree than those who do not believe it to be a serious problem that people are unwilling to be tested for the disease due to stigma, and that people living with HIV/AIDS experience difficulty obtaining housing, health care or employment. Canadian youth are less apt to believe that people living with HIV/AIDS experience difficulties obtaining housing, health care or employment, compa red with Canadians over age 25 years; especially Canadians ages 35 to 64 years old who ar e more apt than the average to agree that people living with HIV/AIDS do experience these dif ficulties. People who identify as a visible minority or as som eone with a disability are more likely to say that people are unwilling to be tested for HIV beca use of the stigma associated with the disease. People with disabilities and Aboriginal Ca nadians are also more likely to agree that people living with HIV/AIDS can experience difficul ty obtaining housing, health care or employment. People of U.K. origin are more likely than those fr om other countries to say that people with HIV/AIDS can experience difficulty obtaining housin g, health care or employment. EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 53 7. HIV/AIDS-R ELATED DISCRIMINATION 7.1 RIGHTS OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV/AIDS Ninety-five percent of Canadians believe that peop le living with HIV/AIDS have the same right to health care as they do, and the same proportion (94 percent) believe that they have the same right to housing. Ninety percent of Canadians believe that p eople living with HIV/AIDS have the same right to employment as they do. These results closely mirror the findings from 2006. Ten percent of Canadians believe that names of peop le with HIV/AIDS should be made public so that others can avoid them, which is consistent with 2006 findings. Canadians are considerably more divided, however, on whether people living with HIV /AIDS should have the right to be sexually active: 55 percent agree, while 22 percent disagree. This is a slight increase from the 48 percent who agreed i n 2006. EKOSResearch Associates Inc.

Canadians living in the Atlantic Provinces are more likely to agree that people living with HIV/AIDS have the same rights to health care as the y do. Canadians with the lowest household incomes (under $20,000) and high school levels of education are less likely to agree that people livi ng with HIV/AIDS have the same right to employment as they do, relative to those with house hold incomes above $20,000 and higher college or university educations. Canadians with th e lowest income and education are also somewhat more likely than other Canadians to feel t he names of people with HIV/AIDS should be made public. People with upper middle incomes (between $80,000 a nd just under $100,000) are more likely to agree that people living with HIV/AIDS have the same rights to employment, health care and housing. People with household incomes above $1 00,000 and university education are more likely than their counterparts to feel that pe ople living with HIV/AIDS have the same right to be sexually active Women are somewhat less apt than men to disagree th at people living with HIV/AIDS have the same right to be sexually active. Seniors are less likely than Canadians under 65 yea rs of age to support the rights of those living with HIV/AIDS to employment and housing, and to be sexually active. They are also somewhat more likely than other Canadians to feel t he names of people with HIV/AIDS should be made public. Those under 35 years of age are the most supportive of the right of someone with HIV/AIDS to health care or to be sexually acti ve. People who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or tr ansgender are more likely than the national average to agree that people living with HIV/AIDS h ave the same right to be sexually active. This is also true of people born in Canada, and peop le with limited or no religious association. Canadians who identify as having a disability, as a visible minority or Aboriginal, and those with strong religious associations, are all somewha t more likely to feel the names of people with HIV/AIDS should be made public. Canadians with a high self-rated level of knowledge of HIV/AIDS, those who know a person with HIV/AIDS, and those who have been tested for H IV/AIDS are more supportive of the rights of people living with HIV/AIDS to employment and housing and to be sexually active. People who do not see HIV/AIDS as being a very seri ous disease today are somewhat more likely to support the right of people living with t his disease to be sexually active than those who see it as a serious disease. On the other hand, thi s group is also more likely than other Canadians to feel the names of people with HIV/AIDS should be made public. EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 55 People who feel their risk of contracting the disea se is high, and who do not know a person with the disease, are also more likely to feel the names of people with HIV/AIDS should be made public. Although most Canadians believe that people living with HIV/AIDS should have the same right to employment as they do, only 65 percent agree tha t people with HIV/AIDS should be allowed to serve t he public in positions like hairstylists. This is up fr om 58 percent in 2006. Forty-five percent of respond ents agree that people with HIV/AIDS should be permitted to work in positions such as dentists, a proportio n that has also increased from 2003 and 2006 (38 and 35 pe rcent, respectively). These results are in contrast to the finding that nine in ten Canadians feel that pe ople living with this disease have the same right t o employment as other Canadians. EKOSResearch Associates Inc.

People living in Alberta are most apt to disagree that people with H IV/AIDS should be allowed to serve the public as dentists. Senior citizens are less likely than those under ag e 65 years to feel that those living with this disease should serve the public in positions such a s dentists or hairstylists. 56 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 The proportion of Canadians who agree that people li ving with this disease should be allowed to serve the public in positions such as dentists o r hairstylists is higher among people with higher education than other Canadians. People with high self-rated levels of knowledge and those who have known someone with HIV/AIDS are also more apt than others to agree tha t people living with this disease should serve the public in positions such as dentists or h airstylists. People who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual or tr ansgender are more likely than others to feel people living with HIV/AIDS should be allowed to wo rk in positions such as dentists and hairstylists. Those who identify as a visible minor ity or as having a disability are the least likely Canadians to feel this way. People born in Canada are more likely than those bo rn outside of Canada to agree that people living with HIV/AIDS should be allowed to work in p ositions such as hairstylists. The same is true for people who identify their ethnic origin as Aboriginal (77 percent), compared to other ethnicities. People with little or no religious association are much more likely than their counterparts to agree that people living with HIV/AIDS should be al lowed to work in positions such as dentists (51 percent versus 38 percent among those with stro ng religious associations). This is also true of hairstylists positions, but the difference is less pronounced (70 percent agree versus 61 percent among those with strong religious associ ations). 7.2 DISCRIMINATION INDEX The following variables were combined to create a d iscrimination index measuring the extent to which Canadians believe (or do not believe) that people living with HIV/AIDS should have their righ ts protected (or conversely, be isolated or segregated from the rest of the population): The extent to which Canadians agree that people livi ng with HIV/AIDS have the same right to employment; The extent to which Canadians agree that people livi ng with HIV/AIDS have the same right to be sexually active; and The extent to which Canadians agree that people livi ng with HIV/AIDS should be quarantined or have their names made public. 17 17 These three items loaded into a common summary me asurement with a high degree of reliability. The ad dition of other items in the battery reduced the reliability of the measure (i.e., were not answered with the sa me degree of commonality). EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 57 Compared with the stigma index presented earlier i n this report (which reflects a degree of acceptance of someone with HIV/AIDS), the discrimin ation index reflects the degree to which people are concerned about the rights of people living with HI V/AIDS. Those with low scores on this discrimination index believe that people with HIV/AIDS should have their rights limited, while those with high sc ores are more supportive of the rights of people li ving with HIV/AIDS. 18 Based on this index, 66 percent of Canadians hold low discriminatory beliefs toward people with HIV/AIDS and are supportive of the rights of p eople living with HIV/AIDS; this proportion has inc reased from 58 percent in 2006. Fifteen percent do not beli eve in supporting the rights of people living with HIV/AIDS. This proportion has decreased from 20 perc ent of Canadians in 2006. Nineteen percent hold moderately strong discriminatory beliefs, compared to 22 percent in 2006. EKOSResearch Associates Inc. HIV/AIDS Awareness Survey, April Towards People Li ving with HIV/AIDS Low discrimination 22% 20% 58% n=2036 18 The direction of the discrimination index is oppo site compared to other indices. Low values of the i ndex represent highly discriminatory views while high values of th e index represent low discrimination. 58 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 Discrimination scores are highest for Canadians liv ing in Alberta, and the Prairie Provinces, while people living in Quebec score the lowest. People with the lowest annual household incomes (un der $20,000) and with no post- secondary education score highest on this index. Scores are also higher for people born outside of C anada relative to those born in Canada. People who identify as having a disability have hig h scores on this index. Canadians over 55 years old score higher than those under 55 years of age. People with strong religious association have highe r scores than those with lower religious association. Those with low self-rated knowledge, who do not know a person with HIV/AIDS, who are not sexually active and who have not been tested for HI V/AIDS score higher than average on this index. EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 59 7.3 RESPONSIBILITIES OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV/AIDS Consistent with findings from 2006, 86 percent of Canadians believe that people living with HIV/AIDS should shoulder the responsibility of prot ecting others from their disease. While most do not feel that the names of people with HIV/AIDS should be ma de public, 79 percent believe that they have a responsibility to tell others that they have the di sease, as was also the case in 2006. Despite these majorities, eight percent do not believe it is the responsibility of people with HIV/AIDS to protect o thers from getting the disease. Ten percent believe it is the r esponsibility of people with HIV/AIDS to tell other s that they have it. EKOSResearch Associates Inc.

People who know a person with HIV/AIDS are more lik ely than the average to agree that it is the responsibility of people living with HIV/AIDS t o protect others from getting the disease. 60 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 People with the lowest incomes and education, senio rs, those who identify as a visible minority and those who feel the disease is very serious toda y are more likely than their counterparts to agree that those with HIV/AIDS are responsible to t ell others of their condition. Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Canadians ar e less likely than average to believe that those with HIV/AIDS are responsible to tell others of their condition. EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 61 8. COMFORT WITH PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV/AIDS 8.1 PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH HIV/AIDS The proportion of Canadians who know or have known someone with HIV/AIDS has remained basically the same since 2003. Forty percent of Cana dians know or have known someone with HIV/AIDS, compared to 37 percent in 2006 and 39 percent in 20 03. EKOSResearch Associates Inc. HIV/AIDS Awareness Survey, April 2012 Personal Experience (a) \"To the best of your knowledge, do you know or have you ever known someone with HIV/AIDS?\" 59% 40% 1% Yes No Yes 37% n=2036 n=2004 n=2000 Residents of British Columbia are more likely than those in other provinces to know or have known someone with HIV/AIDS. Canadians under 35 years of age and 65 years of age or older are less likely to have known someone with HIV/AIDS, while Canadians between the ages of 45 and 64 years are most likely to have known someone with HIV/AIDS. 62 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 The proportion of Canadians who have known someone w ith HIV/AIDS increases with higher levels of education and is higher among people repo rting households of greater than $100,000. Those who are Aboriginal, and those from the United Kingdom are more likely than other Canadians to have known someone with the disease. People who have recently had casual sex partners an d who have been tested for HIV/AIDS are more likely than others to know someone with th e disease. Canadians who rate themselves as very knowledgeable about HIV/AIDS and those with limited or no religious association are also more l ikely than others to say that they know or have known someone with HIV/AIDS. Sixty percent of Canadians who know or have known someone with HIV/AIDS believe that knowing this had little or no impact on their behav iour towards this person. On the other hand, eleven percent say that knowing this made them express mor e sympathy toward that person. Nine percent say the y have become more supportive of that person. Eight p ercent report that knowing a person with the illnes s has raised their awareness about the disease. Canad ians are unlikely to report negative changes in the ir behaviour towards individuals they know with HIV/AI DS; however seven percent report more caution about casual contact and one percent report a reduction o f the time spent with that person.

Those with less education and income are more likely than average to report negative behaviour changes as a result of knowing someone wi th HIV/AIDS, such as being more cautious about casual contact, getting angry toward that person or spending less time with the person. In contrast, people with higher incomes and education levels are more likely than other Canadians to say they became more supportive of that person or increased their awareness about the illness. There is much higher reporting of an increase in awa reness, understanding and tolerance among those who are between the ages of 25 and 34 ( 23 percent) than there is among other age segments. 64 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 8.2 SUPPORT FOR PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV/AIDS Although Canadians believe that they would be high ly supportive of someone they knew with HIV/AIDS, this support weakens when a child is invo lved. Ninety-one percent of Canadians believe that they would react in a supportive manner if they found ou t that a close friend had HIV/AIDS (unchanged from 2006), which is higher than the 81 percent who say they would be supportive if they had an office job where a co-worker had HIV/AIDS (also unchanged from 2006) . Seventy percent say they would be supportive if they had a child attending school with a student wh o had HIV/AIDS (no change from 2006), but twice as many would not be supportive in this situation comp ared to having a co-worker or friend with the illne ss. Very few say that they would actively avoid a close friend or co-worker with HIV/AIDS (three and four percent respectively), but nine percent would activ ely avoid a student in their child's school with HI V/AIDS.

Canadians who have known someone with HIV/AIDS and those who have a high level of self- rated knowledge are also more apt than others to re port support for an individual with HIV/AIDS in all three scenarios. Seniors (65 years of age and older) are least likel y of all age groups to be supportive of a person diagnosed with HIV/AIDS in any of these situ ations. Canadians between the ages of 25 and 34 years would be more supportive than other ag e groups if a close friend had HIV/AIDS. Those who identify as a visible minority are less li kely than others to be supportive if a close friend, co-worker or student at their child's schoo l had HIV/AIDS. Women would be more likely than men to be supportiv e if a co-worker at their office had HIV/AIDS. Those born in Canada are more apt to believe that th ey would be supportive if a student at their child's school had HIV/AIDS, compared with in dividuals born outside of the country. Those with less religious association are more likel y than those with stronger religious association to be supportive if their child went to school with a student who had HIV/AIDS. 66 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 8.3 COMFORT WITH PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV/AIDS Eighty-one percent of Canadians say they would be somewhat or very comfortable working in an office with a co-worker with HIV/AIDS. The propor tion that would be very comfortable in this situati on has risen from 42 percent in 2006 to 51 percent. Sevent y-three percent would be somewhat or very comfortab le wearing a sweater previously worn by someone with H IV/AIDS, and 75 percent would be comfortable or very comfortable shopping in a grocery store where the owner was known to have HIV/AIDS. More Canadians report being very comfortable with these situations than in years previous (50 percent repor ting high comfort this year about wearing a sweater comp ared with 45 percent in 2006 and 48 percent reporti ng high comfort in the retail scenario compared with 4 0 percent in 2006). Comfort declines in other situations. Sixty-two pe rcent would be comfortable or very comfortable with their child attending school with a student known to have HIV/AIDS. The 29 percent reporting strong comfort has increased from 2006, w hen it was 23 percent. Forty-eight percent say that they would feel uncomf ortable using a restaurant drinking glass once used by a person living with HIV/AIDS. The prop ortion that would be very comfortable in this situa tion has increased somewhat; from 26 percent in 2006 to 30 percent in 2012. Fifty-one percent would be uncomfortable if a family member or friend were dat ing someone with the illness. Eighteen percent woul d be very comfortable (a marginal increase from 14 perce nt in 2003). EKOSResearch Associates Inc.

Canadians with the least education (high school or less) are far less comfortable in any of the situations tested than their more formally educated counterparts. People with higher incomes are also more comfortable in these situations, alth ough the difference between comfort levels among those reporting higher versus lower income is not as large in the scenarios related to dating or wearing a sweater. Those with high levels of self-rated knowledge about HIV/AIDS, individuals who have personally known someone with HIV/AIDS, those who h ave been tested for HIV/AIDS, and those with fewer or weaker religious associations a re more comfortable that their counterparts with the situations tested, as are those born in Ca nada (with the exception of the drinking glass scenario in the case of those born in Canada relative to those born outside Canada). Canadians who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender are more likely than other Canadians to be comfortable with all of these situa tions. Canadians who identify as visible minorities are le ss comfortable than others with their child attending school with a student with HIV/AIDS, a cl ose friend or family member dating someone with HIV/AIDS, and wearing a sweater worn b y someone with HIV/AIDS. Proportionately more Canadians living in the Prairi e Provinces are uncomfortable with their child attending school with a student with HIV/AIDS . Residents of British Columbia and the Atlantic Provinces reported the greatest comfort. Ontario residents are marginally more likely than o thers across the country to be comfortable shopping in a grocery store where the owner is know n to have HIV/AIDS. Residents of British Columbia are more likely than the national average to be comfortable working with someone who has HIV/AIDS in an office environment and using a restaurant drinking glass once used by someone with HIV/AIDS. The pattern of comfort and discomfort is quite diffe rent in Quebec. Canadians living in Quebec are less comfortable in a number of the scenarios d escribed (grocery store owner, office, restaurant). On the other hand, although many Canad ians are less comfortable with a situation involving dating, residents of Quebec are far more apt to feel comfortable with a close friend or family member dating a person with HIV/AIDS. In fac t, 67 percent of Canadians living in Quebec indicate that they would be comfortable with this scenario which is the same level of comfort reported for wearing a sweater and much hig her than reported for use of a drinking glass, where only 36 percent indicated comfort (see table 8.1). Discomfort with a close friend or family member dat ing someone with HIV/AIDS is highest among residents of British Columbia, as well as the Prairie Provinces. There are few strong gender differences. 68 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 People who have had a casual sex partner recently a re more likely to be comfortable with a close friend or family member dating someone with H IV/AIDS compared with other Canadians.

The second most common concern among these Canadians is the more generalized possibility that their child could contract HIV/AIDS from the infected student ( 26 percent). The proportions with these specific concerns have decreased from 2006. A lesser concern is that of having their child associating with the 'type of person' who has HIV/AIDS, although one in eight (13 percent) express this concern, which is on par with 2006 results. Other concerns are expressed by five percent or fewer of those who would be uncomfortabl e. EKOSResearch Associates Inc.

EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 71 The primary concern of Canadians who would feel unc omfortable working with someone in an office who has HIV/AIDS is the potential for contra cting it themselves (32 percent). Twenty-one percent would be worried about the possibility of an accide nt where they come into contact with the blood of t he infected person.

This concern is also m ore often expressed among youth under age 25 years, compared with Canadians over 25 years of age, as well as visible minorities compared with non-visible minorities. 72 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 The primary concern of those uncomfortable at the t hought of shopping at a neighbourhood grocery store where the owner has HIV/AIDS is that they might touch the same products that the owner touched (38 percent). Twenty percent are generally c oncerned about contracting HIV/AIDS. Seven percent fear coming into contact with the owner and eight p ercent fear the possibility of food contamination.

EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 73 8.4 COMFORT INDEX Six survey items measuring the level of comfort Ca nadians feel in situations with people living with HIV/AIDS were combined to create a comfort sum mary or index: Extent to which Canadians feel comfortable if their children were to attend a school where one of the students was known to have HIV/AIDS; Extent to which Canadians feel comfortable if they were to work in an office where someone had HIV/AIDS; Extent to which Canadians feel comfortable if they were to shop at a neighbourhood grocery store where the owner had HIV/AIDS; Extent to which Canadians feel comfortable if their close friend or a family member was to date someone with HIV/AIDS; Extent to which Canadians feel comfortable if they were to use a restaurant drinking glass once used by a person living with HIV/AIDS; and Extent to which Canadians feel comfortable if they were to wear a sweater once worn by a person living with HIV/AIDS. 19 19 This set of variables was combined on the basis o f a factor analysis indicating that these measures where answered in similar ways. Other items in the batter y did not load into the summary measure with the sa me degree of reliability. 74 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 Based on this measure, twenty-eight percent of Can adians have a low level of comfort with people living with HIV/AIDS. This has decreased marg inally from 32 percent in 2006. Forty-five percent o f Canadians exhibit a medium level of comfort with HI V/AIDS, compared to 43 percent in 2006. Twenty- seven percent have a high level of comfort, which i s virtually the same as in 2006 (25 percent). EKOSResearch Associates Inc. HIV/AIDS Awareness Survey, April comfort Canadians have with HIV/AIDS Low comfort (1-2.4) Medium comfort (2.5-4.4) 2006 43% 25% 32% n=2036 The lowest comfort scores are found among Canadians living in the Prairie Provinces. People living in British Columbia have higher comfort scor es than other Canadians. People with household incomes under $40,000 and tho se without post-secondary education score lowest for comfort. Men score lower than women on the comfort index. People born outside of Canada score lower than thos e born in Canada for comfort. Canadians whose ethnic origin is neither Canadian n or European score lower than average in terms of comfort, as do people who identify as a vi sible minority. People with strong religious association score lowe r than their counterparts. Seniors score lower than Canadians under 65 years o f age. Those with low self-rated knowledge, who don't know a person with HIV/AIDS, who are not sexually active and who have not been tested for HI V/AIDS score lower than average on this index. EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 75 8.5 FACTORS IN DISCOMFORT WITH HIV/AIDS In terms of explaining the primary drivers behind the fear or discomfort that some Canadians feel when confronted with the presence of HIV/AIDS, 60 percent each say the fatal nature of the diseas e and the notion that HIV/AIDS is associated with cas ual or promiscuous sex are strong influencers on people's discomfort with the disease. 20 There have been significant changes in the proporti ons of Canadians who say people's discomfort is influenced by these two factors: the number attributing their discomfor t to the fatality of the disease has fallen from 72 percent in 2006, whereas the proportion attributing their d iscomfort to the fact that the disease is associated with cas ual/promiscuous sex has risen marginally from 55 pe rcent. Fifty-six percent identify the association between H IV/AIDS and drug use as a factor with a strong infl uence on public discomfort with HIV/AIDS, for which there has been no change from 2006. Fifty-five percent ra te the association with homosexual sex 21 as having a strong influence on public discomfort with HIV/AIDS, which is also the same as in 2006. Forty-one percent attribute discomfort with HIV/AIDS to the fear of it being transmitted through casual contact, which is considered to be a strong factor by a slightly high er proportion of Canadians than was the case in 2006.

Canadians living in Quebec are less likely than other Canadians to feel that discomfort with HIV/AIDS is due to fear of its being transmitted through casual contac t. Residents of Ontario are much more likely than othe r Canadians, especially those living in British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, to say that people's discomfort with HIV/AIDS is influenced by its association with casual/promis cuous sex. Women are more likely than men to identify the fact that HIV/AIDS is a fatal disease and its association with homosexual sex as reasons for peop le's discomfort with the disease. Canadians with the least education are less likely than average to attribute people's discomfort with HIV/AIDS to its association with homosexual se x, while those with a college education are more likely than others to say this is a strong inf luencer of discomfort. Those with less education are also less likely to attribute discomf ort with the disease to the fear some people have that it may be spread through casual contact. They are more likely than others, however, to attribute the discomfort people feel to an assoc iation with drug use. Canadians with origins in the United Kingdom are le ss likely than others to attribute discomfort with HIV/AIDS to the disease being a fatal one, and are more likely to attribute discomfort with the disease to its association with homosexual sex. Canadians between the ages of 25 and 45 years are m ore likely than other age groups to attribute discomfort with HIV/AIDS to the disease b eing a fatal one, while seniors are less likely to say this is a strong factor. Seniors are more likely than those under 65 years of age to attribute discomfort with HIV/AIDS to an associatio n with drug use. Canadians who are between the ages of 35 and 44 yea rs are much more likely than average to attribute people's discomfort with the disease t o the fear some people have that it may be spread through casual contact. Seniors are the leas t likely age group to attribute people's fear to the belief that they can contract the disease th rough casual contact. Youth (under 25 years of age) are the most likely age cohort to say that a strong association with homosexual sex is a limited factor in people's fear of the disease. Those with stronger ties to religion are more likely than others to identify the association between HIV/AIDS and casual/promiscuous sex, and it s association with drug use as sources of people's discomfort. Canadians who perceive HIV/AIDS to be a serious dis ease, who rate their knowledge of the disease as high, and who have known a person with H IV/AIDS are more likely than others to say that people's discomfort with the disease is st rongly influenced by its fatal nature. EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 77 People who have been tested for HIV/AIDS are more l ikely than those who have not been tested to attribute discomfort with the disease to the fear some people have that it may be spread through casual contact and to say that disco mfort with the disease is strongly influenced by its fatal nature. EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 79 9. INFORMATION SOURCES 9.1 CURRENT INFORMATION SOURCES Canadians continue to rely on newspaper articles a nd television as sources of information about HIV/AIDS, but the 2012 survey demonstrates th e emerging prominence of the Internet as an information source. Newspaper articles (31 percent) and television in general (31 percent) are still t he two primary sources where Canadians say that they have recently heard, seen or read about HIV/AIDS. Television sources may be even more pervasive, given that fifteen percent of Canadians specifically cit e television news (15 percent), four percent cite a TV health program, and three percent cite a TV show or movie as their information sources about HIV/AIDS. As many as 41 percent may have recently obtained their information from online sources: twenty-six p ercent have obtained their information from the Int ernet or websites in general and others specify getting thei r information from news websites (five percent), Go ogle (four percent), health/medical websites (three perc ent) and social media (three percent). In addition to newspapers, some other print forms remain popular i nformation sources: fourteen percent have obtained information from magazines in general, and a furthe r three percent identify a health magazine specific ally; three percent cite books/libraries, and two percent cite health journals. Nine percent identify radio news as a source of information where they have heard somethi ng about HIV/AIDS, and a further two percent cite a radio health show specifically. Six percent cite fa mily or friends. Less common sources of information about HIV/AIDS include doctors (four percent) and nurses/ other health care professionals (two percent); scho ols (five percent) and work (three percent); AIDS organ izations (two percent); Health Canada (two percent) ; and general advertising (four percent). Compared with results from 2006 22 , there has been a notable shift away from the prev iously most common sources of information - newspapers, ma gazines, television - with gains in the number of Canadians who identified the Internet or websites a s a source of information (up from 15 percent sayin g the Internet or websites generally in 2006, and nine pe rcent in 2003). Virtually all other sources of info rmation have been usurped by the widespread access and use of the Internet by Canadians (television news and magazines in particular). Even in-person informatio n sources - doctors, nurses and other health care professionals - are being accessed less often for i nformation about HIV/AIDS: doctors were a source of information for nine percent of Canadians in 2003, falling five points in 2012; and nurses and other h ealth care professionals were cited by nine percent in 20 03 but just two percent cited them in 2012. 22 In 2003, respondents were asked about where they h ad seen, read or heard about HIV/AIDS in the past ( with the timeframe left unspecified), while in 2006 and 2012 they were asked specifically about the past year. 80 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 EKOS Research Information Sources \"Where have you heard, seen or read about HIV/AIDS in the past year?\" School Family or friends Newspaper article Television news Google -- -- TV health program 21% 6% EKOSResearch Associates Inc. journals Don't know/no response AIDS organizations Health Canada EKOSResearch Associates Inc.

Residents of Alberta cite television news and radio news more often than other Canadians . Canadians living in Ontario more often identify newspaper articles compared to other Canad ians. Canadians in the $60,000 to $79,000 household incom e bracket are more likely to have obtained their information from magazines (in gener al). Canadians in the highest income range ($150,000 and over) and with the highest educ ation are more likely than other Canadians to have read about HIV/AIDS in a newspape r article or on the Internet. Men are more likely than women to identify newspape r articles as sources of information on HIV/AIDS. Youth (under 25 years of age) are most likely to ha ve heard about HIV/AIDS at school (28 percent). They are also somewhat more apt to hav e cited advertising in posters or pamphlets as an information source compared with Ca nadians who are 25 years of age or older. Canadians aged 55 years and older are far le ss likely than those under 55 years of age to say they saw something on the Internet. Newspape r articles are a more commonly selected source of information for those over 55 years of ag e relative to their counterparts. Websites/Internet in general are more likely than t he national average to have been accessed for HIV/AIDS information by people with high self-r ated levels of knowledge of the disease, people who know someone with HIV/AIDS, people who a re sexually active, and those without casual sex partners. Relative to the national average, newspaper article s are also more commonly cited as a source of information for people born outside of Ca nada; people with origins in the United Kingdom; Canadians over 55 years old; people with l ow self-rated knowledge of the disease; people with low perceived risk of contracting it; a nd those who have not been tested for HIV/AIDS. People of European background are more likely than other Canadians to cite the Internet/websites as their information sources. Those identifying as gay, lesbian, bisexual or trans gender are more apt than others to cite advertising in posters and pamphlets, AIDS organiza tions and friends or family as preferred sources for information relative to the propensity of other Canadians to cite these sources. 82 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 9.2 PREFERRED INFORMATION SOURCES Eighty percent of Canadians say they would go to t he Internet (in general) for information as their preferred source, and 38 percent of these res pondents say that they would go to Google specifica lly, although only 26 percent say that they have actuall y gone to the Internet (including Google) in the pa st year. The pervasiveness of the Internet as a top of mind i nformation source has climbed steadily since 2003, when 48 percent named it as their first choice (ver sus 80 percent in 2012) when looking for informatio n about HIV/AIDS. A further eight percent indicate th ey would look specifically for information on a hea lth or medical website. Four percent of Canadians say that in the past year they have gone to a doctor for information about HIV/AIDS, although 18 percent say they would go to a doctor for information on the subject if th ey were looking for it. Despite declining numbers that say they would go to a doctor for this information (34 percent said this in 2006, and 39 percent in 20 03), doctors remain the next most sought after sour ce for information on HIV/AIDS, after the Internet and Goo gle. Similarly, seven percent say they would get th is information from nurses or other health care profes sionals, although only two percent report that they actually did get information from those individuals in the last year. This proportion has also fallen considerably, from 20 percent in 2006 and 23 percen t in 2003. Health Canada is cited by 13 percent of Canadians as a preferred source, having risen from seven and eight percent in 2003 and 2006 respective ly (although only two percent of respondents said they actually received information from Health Canada i n the past year). Although books and libraries are used much less of ten today in the age of wireless communication and widely accessible Internet, they still remain, for seven percent, a source that woul d be sought out when looking specifically for informatio n on HIV/AIDS. EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 83 EKOSResearch Associates Inc. you were looking for information about HIV/AIDS today, where would you go to get that information?\" Nurse/Health care prof. Doctors Books/library Family or friends Don't know/no response PHAC Government sites Social media Google n=968 -- Only items with 2% or more shown on -- -- Health/medical websites -- -- Health journals -- -- Residents of Alberta are somewhat more likely than others across the country to cite websites/the Internet generally and Google in parti cular as a source they would go to. Although residents of all provinces select the Inte rnet most often as their primary information source, there are variations in secondary or additi onal sources selected by different provinces. Residents of Saskatchewan and Manitoba, for example , are somewhat more likely than those in other provinces to look for information about HI V/AIDS in books or libraries (although the Internet is still their primary source). Canadians living in Quebec have a slightly greater propensity than other residents to cite Health Cana da as a source if they were looking for information, although again, the Internet is the mo st popular source. Seniors (65 years of age and older) are less apt to consult the Internet compared with younger Canadians, although it is still their primary sourc e of information. They are more likely than other Canadians to consult with doctors as a second most popular source (25 percent). Canadians with high school education or less (who a re typically older) are also less apt to consult the Internet (although 63 percent would, co mpared with 71 percent with a college diploma and 75 percent with a university level of e ducation). As a secondary source, they are more likely to consult a doctor than other Canadian s (24 percent compared with 14 percent among those with a university level of education). Even though all segments select the Internet as the ir primary source, the likelihood of seeking information on the Internet tends to increase with income (58 percent in the lowest income 84 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 group would look for information on the Internet co mpared to 75 percent in the highest income group). While the Internet is most often selected as their primary source of information, people born in Canada are somewhat more likely to also get informa tion from doctors (20 percent) compared to those who were born abroad (12 percent). People with disabilities are less likely than the a verage to get information from the Internet (although it is still the more prevalent source). A lthough not selected by a large proportion, this segment is somewhat more likely to get information from an AIDS organization or community group or nurse/health care providers (12 percent ve rsus the national average of five percent). 9.3 RELIABILITY OF AND COMFORT WITH INFORMATION SOURCES Canadians were asked to rate the reliability and their level of comfort with a variety of information sources on HIV/AIDS. To reduce the overa ll number of questions on the survey and thus reduc e the time required to respond to the survey, one hal f of the survey sample was asked to rate the reliab ility and their comfort level with some of these sources, while the other half of the sample was asked to ra te the reliability and comfort with a different set of sou rces. Canadians consider their family doctor or another health care professional to be the most reliable information source (85 percent consider th is source to be highly reliable), followed by the P ublic Health Agency of Canada (80 percent), Health Canada (79 percent), and pharmacists (70 percent). The perceived reliability of family doctors or other he alth care professionals as a source of information on HIV/AIDS grew between 2003 and 2006 (from 76 percen t to 84 percent) and remains high in 2012. The Public Health Agency of Canada is also still regard ed as highly reliable by most Canadians. There was a significant increase between 2003 and 2006, from 65 percent in 2003 to 79 percent in 2006; the Public Health Agency of Canada is currently regarded as hi ghly reliable by 80 percent. Fifty-five percent of Canadians consider a person l iving with HIV/AIDS to be a highly reliable information source, a proportion which has increase d marginally from 50 percent in 2006. The Government of Canada is considered to be a highly reliable sou rce by 54 percent; on par with results from 2006. A n anonymous clinic continues to be perceived as a hig hly reliable source by considerably fewer Canadians than a family doctor or even a pharmacist (37 perce nt), consistent with 2006 findings. The number of Canadians under 18 that say teachers or school counsellors are highly reliable sources of information about HIV/AIDS is decreasing . In this survey, 30 percent said a school counsell or would be reliable, compared to 39 percent in 2006; and 22 percent said a teacher would be a highly rel iable source, compared to 30 percent in 2006. EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 85 Family is considered to be a highly reliable source by 25 percent of Canadians, which is lower than found in 2006 but on par with the results from 2003. In spite of the fact that mass media, partic ularly in the form of television and newspapers, are some of the most frequently cited sources of information on HIV/AIDS, only 17 percent see these sources as high ly reliable, which is on par with previous results. Only 14 percent consider friends to be a highly reliable source when it comes to information about HIV/AIDS , which is similar to 2006 but lower than found in 20 03. 843222 36 39 25 17 15 12 55 70 79 80 85 54 Reliability of Sources PHAC (n=480)Your family doctor or another health care professional \"How reliable do you consider the following as a so urce of information about HIV/AIDS?\" A person living with HIV/AIDS A pharmacist Canada (n=506) -- -- EKOSResearch Associates Inc.

Residents of Alberta are the least likely to place their faith in the media (nin e percent). Those living in the Atlantic Provinces are the most likely across the country to rate a pe rson with HIV//AIDS as a reliable source of information (66 percent). The extent to which doctors, the Public Health Agenc y of Canada and the federal government are considered reliable increases with individuals' education and income. For example, 44 percent of those with high school education or l ess consider the federal government reliable, compared with 60 percent of those with un iversity education; and 74 percent of those in the lowest income range feel that doctors and ot her health care professionals are reliable, compared to people with incomes of $60,000 and grea ter (between 88 to 91 percent in four different income brackets). Those with high school e ducation or less are more apt to consider family to be a reliable information source. Those wi th lower incomes (under $40,000) and with a college education are more likely to consider the media to be reliable, compared with Canadians with higher socioeconomic status. Friends and family are also seen as more reliable sources among those reporting less income and education. Younger Canadians (under 35 years of age) are more likely to feel that doctors/other health care professionals and the Public Health Agency of Canada/Health Canada are reliable sources, and are less likely to consider their frie nds to be very reliable. The same pattern is also true of parents of younger children. Canadians over 55 years of age are much more likely than those under 25 years of age to trust their fam ily (32 percent among those 55 to 64 years of age and 37 percent among those 65 years of age o r older, compared to 14 percent). Seniors are much less likely to trust the Public He alth Agency of Canada, the government and a person living with HIV/AIDS for reliable informat ion. They are most likely among the age groups to place their faith in friends and, in part icular, family to provide them with reliable information. Women are somewhat more likely than men to consider a person living with HIV/AIDS be a reliable information source. Those with strong religious associations are more li kely to feel that doctors and other health care professionals and family are reliable sources, but are less likely to feel that the Public Health Agency of Canada is a reliable source, compa red to those with those with less strong religious associations. People born outside of Canada are more likely to fe el the Government of Canada is a reliable source, and particularly those of non-European or N orth American background are likely to find the government to be reliable compared to thos e born in Canada. People who have had a casual sex partner in the las t 12 months are less likely to feel that doctors and other health care professionals are rel iable sources compared to those with no casual sexual partner in the last 12 months. EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 87 People who identify as having a disability are less likely to trust the Public Health Agency of Canada for reliable information compared to the ave rage Canadian. Those who know someone with HIV/AIDS, and those who consider themselves to be quite knowledgeable about the disease, are more likely to consider their families and a person living with the disease to be reliable information sources compared to those who do not know someone with HIV/AIDS and those who consider themse lves to be less knowledgeable about the disease An anonymous clinic is more likely to be perceived as a reliable source for information about HIV/AIDS by those who: are lesbian, gay, transgende r or bisexual; are university graduates; consider themselves knowledgeable about HIV; have b een tested for HIV/AIDS; and have had a casual partner in the last year compared with the ir counterparts in each case. Ninety-four percent of Canadians would feel comfor table seeking information on HIV/AIDS from their family doctor or another health care pro fessional. Eighty-three percent indicate comfort wi th a pharmacist. These are also sources that are widely identified as reliable. Seventy-eight percent of Canadians would feel comfortable seeking informatio n from a person living with HIV/AIDS, despite the f act that this source is not perceived to be among the m ost reliable of information sources. The proportion s of Canadians feeling comfortable with these sources ha ve remained the same from 2006. Sixty-six percent of Canadians would be comfortabl e seeking information from an anonymous clinic, and sixty-five percent would be comfortable seeking information from friends. Sixty-three perc ent are also comfortable seeking information from their fam ily. Among school-aged youth, the proportion that w ould feel comfortable approaching a school counsellor ha s decreased marginally from 71 percent in 2006 to 65 percent in 2012. Likewise, the proportion of tho se who would feel comfortable approaching a teacher has decreased to the same degree, from 64 percent in 20 06 to 59 percent in 2012. As noted earlier, fewer t han four in ten Canadians considered these sources to b e highly reliable. 88 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 EKOSResearch Associates Inc.

Quebec residents are also more likely to be comfortable seeking information from an anonymous clinic and from friends relative to the national average. Comfort with seeking information from a pharmacist increases with age: 63 percent of seniors are comfortable seeking information from this sourc e, compared to 42 percent of people under age 25. Fewer older Canadians would be comfortable than Canadians under age 65 in seeking information from an anonymous clinic or a p erson living with HIV/AIDS. Canadians under 25 years of age are much less likel y to be comfortable getting information from their families (20 percent) compared to those who are older, particularly relative to those who are between the ages of 45 and 54 years (38 per cent). Those with a high school education or less are also less apt to be comfortable seeking information from an anonymous clinic and from a per son living with HIV/AIDS than others with more education. Women are more likely to be comfortable than men wi th getting information about HIV/AIDS from their friends or a person living with HIV/AIDS . Women are also more likely than men to feel uncomfortable getting information from their f amily. People born outside of Canada are more likely than those born in Canada to be comfortable getting information from their friends about HIV/AI DS. EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 89 People with disabilities are somewhat less apt to b e comfortable seeking information from a pharmacist relative to other Canadians. Lesbian, gay, transsexual and bisexual Canadians ar e less likely than average to feel comfortable getting information about HIV/AIDS from their families and are more often comfortable than average getting information from a n anonymous clinic. Those who have had a casual sex partner in the last year are less likely than others to be very comfortable seeking information from a doctor or ot her health professional, an anonymous clinic or family members. People with strong religious associations are less likely than those with weaker or no associations to be comfortable accessing informatio n from an anonymous clinic. 90 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 9.4 MOST EFFECTIVE MEANS OF COMMUNICATING INFORMATION ON HIV/AIDS In terms of effective ways to provide people with information about HIV/AIDS, Canadians point most often to public education announcements on tel evision (60 percent). Although television is one of the top sources through which Canadians say they receiv ed information on HIV/AIDS in the past year, the number who believe this to be an effective means of communicating messages about HIV/AIDS has decreased significantly from 2006 when 77 percent s ay this was effective. Brochures or information kit s sent to people's homes, although still perceived to be a generally effective way of communicating with peop le according to 40 percent, has also significantly dec reased from 53 percent in 2006. These major changes may be explained by the increas ed popularity of the Internet. Thirty-six percent of Canadians think that information on the Internet is an effective method, and thirty-two per cent think that social media would be effective. (Neithe r of these was offered as an option in 2006.) Other methods have seen significant decreases in the numb er of Canadians who feel these are effective ways o f communicating about HIV/AIDS: public education anno uncements (PSAs) on the radio (25 percent, down considerably from 35 percent in 2006), in the newsp aper (18 percent, down considerably from 41 percent in 2006), and in magazines (nine percent, down conside rably from 25 percent in 2006). EKOSResearch Associates Inc.

Residents of Quebec on the other hand, are least likely of all Canadians to po int to social media as an effective source (26 percent). Brochures and information kits sent to individual h omes are the second most commonly cited effective source of information after television PS As among lower income households; cited far more frequently than among Canadians with greater h ousehold incomes. Brochures and kits are also most likely to be seen as an effective met hod of distributing information (after television PSAs) among those with high school level s of education, relative to their more affluent and educated counterparts. Among middle income and educated Canadians (i.e., $ 40,000 to $60,000 and college level education) public service announcements on televisi on are even more often seen as an effective source relative to the national average. Those with higher incomes and education levels ($80,000 to $150,000 and university) are mor e likely than other Canadians to point to the Internet and social media as effective sources, although television PSAs are still the most commonly cited method. Canadians of non-European or North American backgro und are more likely than those from other backgrounds to say radio announcements are an effective communication channel for this topic, although television is still the most p opular source for effective communication. Canadians under 35 years of age are much more likel y than seniors to prefer social media as an effective communication source on this topic alt hough television is still a more popular source for effective communication. Seniors are par ticularly unlikely to point to the Internet or social media as effective sources. Those identifying themselves as gay, lesbian, transg ender or bisexual are more apt than other Canadians to point to PSAs on the radio or televisi on, as are those with limited religious association. EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 93 10. HEPATITIS C 10.1 KNOWLEDGE AND AWARENESS OF HEPATITIS C In terms of a general knowledge of hepatitis C, 85 percent of Canadians believe that \"people who have shared a needle only once are at risk of b eing infected with the hepatitis C virus\". Only seven percent do not believe this statement. Eighty -three percent understand that \"many people who hav e been infected with the hepatitis C virus do not kno w they have the disease\". Canadians are less certai n of whether \"blood recipients are at a high risk of con tracting the hepatitis C virus\", with 44 percent sa ying this statement is true and 43 percent believing it to be false. Eighteen percent feel it is true that \"peop le in my age group are more likely to become infected with t he hepatitis C virus than those in other age groups \", while 65 percent feel this is false.

The propensity to say that this statement is true is also higher among residents of the Atlantic Provinces compared to residents elsewhere in Canada. It is lowest in Quebec and among those with a disability, as well as those born outside of Canada, and youth in general, although, even in these segme nts, most agree that the statement is true. Younger Canadians (35 years of age and younger) are more apt than older Canadians to indicate that people in their age group are more li kely to become infected with hepatitis C. Those born in Canada are more apt than those born ou tside Canada to believe it is false that blood recipients are at a high risk of contracting the disease. Similarly, younger Canadians are also more likely to feel it is false that blood rec ipients are at a high risk of contracting hepatitis C. Canadians who feel that hepatitis C and HIV/AIDS ar e both very serious diseases are more likely to believe it is true that blood recipients are at a high risk of contracting the virus. Those who feel that their risk of contracting hepati tis C is low are more apt to believe it is false that blood recipients are at a high risk of contrac ting the virus.

In fact, there is some controversy about whether there is a cure, given that some physicians would argue t hat once a patient is given a viral clearance after treatment, they can be considered \"cured\". EKOSResearch Associates Inc. HIV/AIDS Awareness Survey, April 2012 Other Knowledge \"Can Hepatitis C Be Cured?\" \"To the best of your knowledge, can hepatitis C be c ured?\" 55% 23% 22% Yes No Don't know/no response n=1032 98 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 Younger (under age 25 years) and older (65 years ol d and over) Canadians are more likely than others to incorrectly believe that hepatitis C can be cured. Those between the ages of 35 and 54 years are the most likely to understand that hepatitis C cannot be cured. Those with the least education and income, along wit h those born outside of Canada and residents of Quebec, are more likely than their cou nterparts to incorrectly believe that hepatitis C can be cured. Canadians who know that hepatitis C cannot be cured also tend to have a higher self-rated knowledge of hepatitis C, have been tested for HIV, or know someone with HIV/AIDS. Fifty percent of Canadians believe there is a vacci ne available to prevent someone from becoming infected with hepatitis C. This belief is i ncorrect, as no vaccination against HCV exists (alt hough there are vaccinations available for hepatitis A an d hepatitis B at no cost for most Canadians). The remainder are divided between believing there is no vaccine available (26 percent) or not knowing one way or the other or not providing a response to this qu estion (24 percent). Therefore, only 26 percent of Canadians know that there is no vaccine available f or hepatitis C. EKOSResearch Associates Inc. HIV/AIDS Awareness Survey, April 2012 Knowledge of Vaccine Available \"Is there a vaccine available to prevent someone fro m becoming infected with hepatitis C?\" 26% 50% 24% Yes No Don't know/no response n=1032 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 99 Younger Canadians (under age 25 years), along with those with lower income, those reporting an origin other than Canadian, European or Aborigin al, are more apt than others to incorrectly believe that there is a vaccine for hepatitis C. Canadians living in Ontario are more apt than those in other regions to incorrectly believe there is a vaccine for hepatitis C, while residents of British Columbia are most likely to indicate that there is no vaccine. Canadians who know that there is currently no vacci ne for hepatitis C are more likely than those who believe there is a vaccine to have a high er self-rated knowledge of hepatitis C, have been tested for HIV, or know someone with HIV/AIDS. However, 48 percent of those rating their self-knowledge of hepatitis C as high still i ncorrectly believe there is a vaccine, compared to 37 percent with high knowledge who indicate ther e is no vaccine. 10.2 KNOWLEDGE REGARDING TRANSMISSION OF HEPATITIS C The actual factors associated with the highest risk of hepatitis C exposure 23 include injection drug use (IDU); incarceration 24 ; being born, travelling in or residing in a countr y where hepatitis C is more common; and receiving health care in a setting wher e there is a lack of universal precautions to reduc e contamination. Up until 1992, receiving a blood tra nsfusion, blood product or organ transplant was als o a high risk factor in Canada, the U.S., Australia, Ne w Zealand and western European countries. This has since become a low risk factor for transmission in these countries, although in other countries this r isk still remains moderate to high. Factors that pose a modera te risk for exposure to hepatitis C in Canada inclu de hemodialysis, birth to a mother with hepatitis C, a nd needle stick injuries. When asked how hepatitis C is passed on to another person 25 , 23 percent of Canadians correctly identify injection drug use/sharing drug needles as a way hepatitis C is transmitted (compar ed with 31 percent who report this method of transmitting H IV). However, 36 percent of Canadians answer that t he hepatitis C virus is spread through blood transfusi ons, even though today in Canada this is a relative ly low risk factor. 26 (This risk factor is not mentioned by Canadians as a method of transmitting HIV/AIDS.) Also, 25 23 Public Health Agency of Canada, College of Family Physicians of Canada. Primary Care Management of C hronic Hepatitis C. Online, http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/hep c/pubs/pdf/hepc_guide-eng.pdf 24 Through shared/contaminated shared/contaminat ed tattooing materials (e.g., needles, inks); physical trauma (e .g., fighting where blood is present); and unprotec ted sex where blood may be present (e.g., anal intercourse, fisti ng). 25 This question was asked without using prompts. 26 However, the question did not ask respondents to specify a timeframe (e.g., what is a method of tran smission today versus in the past), a location (e.g., in Canada, o r elsewhere in the world), or the level of risk ass ociated with methods of transmission (e.g., high risk versus med ium or low risk). 100 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 percent of Canadians indicate that people become in fected with the hepatitis C virus through unsafe/unprotected intercourse between a man and a woman (compared with 63 percent who cite this as a method of transmitting HIV), when in fact, unsafe/u nprotected intercourse between a man and a woman is a lower risk factor for transmitting hepatitis C than it is for transmitting hepatitis B or HIV/AIDS. So me sexual behaviours are associated with hepatitis C transmis sion (such as unprotected sex with an HCV-positive partner), but these present a lower risk than other factors like injection drug use. Just four percent of Canadians cite foreign/third world country travel a s a mode of transmission, even though this is a hig h risk factor. Just one percent of Canadians cite from mother to child during pregnancy as a method of transmission, even though this does pose an interme diate risk of exposure. Between four and seven perc ent say that sharing personal hygiene items (e.g., toot hbrushes, razors) and tattoos/body piercings are wa ys of transmitting the virus, which are in fact lower ris k factors sometimes associated with hepatitis C exp osure. Fewer than ten percent of Canadians say that any of the following are ways that hepatitis C is passed from person to person: casual contact (e.g., kissing, hugging, shaking hands), which actually presents no risk of exposure; drinking water; unsan and general uncleanliness. Tw enty-five percent of respondents indicate that they do not know how hepatitis C is transmitted or provide no response, compared with only four percent of respondents when asked how HIV/AIDS is transmitted. Five percent provide other responses, such as exchanging of bodily fluids, including saliva; cont aminated water, including swimming pools and ice cu bes; and coughing or sneezing.

Injection drug use/sharing of drug needles is a more popular respo nse among Canadians residing in the Atlantic provinces than the national average. Men who are 65 or older are less apt to cite blood transfusions as a key risk factor for hepatitis C compared with younger age cohorts, or among women in this age group. Unsafe/unprotected intercourse between men and wome n is cited more frequently by 35 to 44 year old Canadians relative to other age groups. Me n between the ages of 55 and 64 years also stand out as more apt to cite this as a risk f actor. Women between the ages of 25 and 34 are more likely to point to injection drug use/shar ing of drug needles than other age cohorts. This is also true of men between the ages of 55 and 64 years. Men who are 25 to 34 years of age are the most likely to cite tattoos and body pi ercing as a high risk factor. The belief that hepatitis C is passed along through blood transfusions or injection drug use/sharing drug needles increases with education. Those who rate their knowledge of hepatitis C or HIV /AIDS as high, along with those who perceive themselves to be at a low risk of contract ing hepatitis C, are more likely than other Canadians to believe that hepatitis C can be contra cted through blood transfusions, injection drug use/sharing drug needles, or unsafe/unprotecte d sex between a man and a woman. EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 103 Respondents from Eastern and Western Europe are mor e likely to cite unsafe/unprotected intercourse between men and women as a high risk fa ctor compared with respondents from other parts of the world. 10.3 KNOWLEDGE OF GROUPS AT RISK FOR HEPATITIS C Twenty-seven percent of Canadians name injection dr ug users as the group most at risk of being infected with hepatitis C. Twenty-two percent see younger people in general as the group most at risk of being infected with hepatitis C. Eleven percent name users of other drugs as an at risk group. Othe r groups such as older people, blood transfusion reci pients, men who have sex with men, health care professionals, those who practice unprotected sex, prostitutes/sex workers, those with multiple sex pa rtners, and people who travel are named by four to seven pe rcent of respondents in each case. Three percent or fewer report Aboriginal people, those with tattoos or body piercings, those who share items potentiall y contaminated with blood, blood donors, those with p oor health, and lower income families as groups who are particularly at risk of contracting hepatitis C . Eight percent believe that there are no particula r groups that are more likely to contract hepatitis C. As wi th HIV awareness, where 26 percent of Canadians are unable to or do not identify any specific groups at risk of contracting HIV, 23 percent of Canadians a re unable to or do not identify a specific group at ri sk of contracting hepatitis C. Canadians in British Columbia are the most likely a cross the country to identify injection drug users as being the group most at risk of being infe cted with hepatitis C. 28 Those who identify themselves as lesbian, gay, bisex ual, or transgender are more likely than average to mention sex trade workers and those with multiple sex partners as at risk groups. People who identify as a visible minority are more likely to say that both younger (37 percent) and older people (16 percent), as well as homeless people (six percent) are groups particularly at risk for contracting hepatitis C. This is also tr ue for Canadians identifying an ethnic origin other than Canadian, UK, European, or Aboriginal. Canadians who are 65 years of age and over are more apt than other age groups to identify younger people as being most at risk for contractin g hepatitis C (33 percent, while younger Canadians (age 25 to 34 years) are more likely to s ee older people as being most at risk (13 percent) than those over the age of 35 years are to have said the same (three to seven percent in the different age segments over 35 years of age). This is also true of those under 25 years of age (10 percent). 28 As with HIV infection perceptions, this finding m ay be related, in part, to the high incidence of in jection drug use on the lower Eastside of Vancouver. 104 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 Those who identify as being at high risk of contract ing hepatitis C are more likely (24 percent) than those who perceive themselves at low risk (sev en percent) to say that the disease does not target a particular group or segment of society .

Fifty-five percent indicate they are moderat ely knowledgeable, while 31 percent feel they are n ot knowledgeable about hepatitis C. Self-reported know ledge levels regarding hepatitis C are lower than t hose reported for HIV/AIDS, where 22 percent rate themse lves highly knowledgeable, 67 percent rate themselv es moderately knowledgeable and only 11 percent rate t hemselves not knowledgeable. EKOSResearch Associates Inc. HIV/AIDS Awareness Survey, April 2012 Self-Rated Knowledge \"How knowledgeable would you say that you are about hepatitis C?\" 1% 13% 31% 55% (6-7) Don't know/no response n=1032 Residents of Quebec have a higher self-rated knowle dge score regarding hepatitis C than others across the country. Younger Canadians (under age 25 years), along with those with lower education and income, rate themselves least knowledgeable about the hepat itis C virus relative to their counterparts. Those who indicate they are highly knowledgeable abo ut the hepatitis C virus are also more apt than average to rate their knowledge of HIV/AID S as high, which is also the case for those who feel the hepatitis C virus is very serious or t hat they are at a higher risk of contracting hepatitis C. Those rated their knowledge high also tend to be mor e comfortable in situations involving someone with HIV/AIDS (e.g., sharing a glass in a r estaurant, wearing a sweater, their child attending the same school, etc.) and are less apt t o distance themselves from HIV/AIDS (as a 106 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 disease belonging to drug users, gay people and tho se living in third world countries). They are also more apt to know that someone can have HIV for 10 or more years without developing AIDS. While only 16 percent of those who say they are ver y knowledgeable about hepatitis C have been tested for HIV/AIDS, those who have been teste d for HIV are more likely to have a high self-rated knowledge of hepatitis C (47 percent). 10.5 PERCEPTION OF RISK Thirty-two percent of Canadians perceive themselves to be at a moderate (28 percent) or high (four percent) risk of contracting hepatitis C. This is almost three times higher than the 12 percent o f Canadians who consider themselves to be at a modera te to high risk of contracting HIV. Sixty-one perce nt of Canadians considers themselves to be at a low ri sk of contracting hepatitis C. EKOSResearch Associates Inc. HIV/AIDS Awareness Survey, April 2012 Perception of Personal Risk for Hepatitis C \"How would you rate your own personal risk of know/no response n=1032 High risk (6-7) Perceived risk of contracting hepatitis C is highes t among Canadians between 35 and 44 years of age and tends to decrease over age 45 year s (see Table 10.3). Aboriginal respondents are more likely than other C anadians to feel they are at risk for hepatitis C, with 12 percent indicating they are at a high risk. This risk is highest among First Nations living off-reserve and lowest among Inuit. Those between the ages of 35 and 44 are EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 107 also more apt to say their personal risk is high (1 9 percent), followed by seniors (11 percent), compared with Aboriginal people in other age segmen ts. The perception of risk is lowest among those with a disability and those reporting themselves to be from the United Kingdom.

Sixty-two percent indicate that th ey would seek out information on hepatitis C online. Doctors are noted as a main information source by 35 perce nt of Canadians, followed closely by a specifically ident ified online source, Google (34 percent). Health Ca nada Hepatitis C programs are mentioned as potential inf ormation sources by 14 percent. Six to seven percen t indicate more specifically that health/medical site s or Wikipedia would be an information source for hepatitis C information. Four percent would seek out information from health care professionals other t han doctors or the Public Health Agency of Canada. Four percent cite Health Canada. Two percent mention media sources such as TV news or newspapers. Two perc ent indicate other sources, including provincial sources (e.g., B.C. Health, Alberta Health Link, Sa nt\u00e9 Nouveau Brunswick) and the Mayo Clinic. Canadians living in Quebec are more apt to indicate news media (TV news, radio news, newspapers) or Health Canada as preferred sources o f information. They are generally less likely to go to the Internet than others across the country. Residents of Ontario are more likely than those in other regions to point to the Interne t, and Google specifically, as an information source about hepatitis C. 108 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 Aboriginal people are more likely than other Canadi ans to name nurses as a potential source for hepatitis C information. Younger Canadians (under 25 years of age) are more apt to cite the Internet, and Google and Wikipedia in particular, as well as schools/univers ities as sources of information. The Internet, and Google in particular, are also mor e often the chosen source for information among those with higher incomes and education. The H ealth Canada Hepatitis C program is also a more popular source among those with higher income, particularly in the $100,000 to $150,000 bracket.

TYPOLOGY OF CANADIANS In addition to the basic analyses cited throughout the report, a typology of Canadians was replicated from 2006. The typology groups Canadians into segments of people with similar knowledge leve ls and attitudes regarding HIV/AIDS. The methods used a re factor and reliability analyses (leading to the computation of several indices presented earlier in the report), and cluster analysis. The five factors used in the 2006 typology were again included in the 2012 t ypology: knowledge, comfort, distancing, stigma, an d discrimination (as presented earlier in the report) . A reliability analysis was conducted on these fac tors, resulting in alpha coefficients that were 0.50 or h igher, suggesting that the composite scales compute d on the base of the listed dimensions are statistically reliable measures.

Each segment of the typology is described one by o ne in more detail in the following sections. 11.1 SEGMENT ONE : INFORMED OPEN -MINDED This segment represents the largest share of the Ca nadian population (41 percent in 2012; 38 percent in 2006). Representative members of this se gment have the highest knowledge (73 percent scored high on the knowledge index versus 39 percent in the overall sample), are the most co mfortable with people living with HIV/AIDS, are the least stigmatizing (9 2 percent scored low on the stigma index compared w ith 71 percent overall), and are the least likely to di stance themselves from the issue (79 percent scored low on the distance index compared to 52 percent in the ov erall sample). They are also least likely to discrim inate against someone with HIV/AIDS (87 percent have a lo w discrimination score on the index versus a nation al average of 66 percent). They are also least likely t o believe that people with HIV/AIDS should have the ir names made public to protect others (95 percent dis agree with this compared to a national average of 81 percent). EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 115 This group is most likely, compared to the other fou r segments, to know about methods of transmission and testing. They generally demonstrate a very good understanding of HIV/AIDS and know that there is no known cure. Although they are not more likely than other Canadi ans to believe that HIV/AIDS is a very serious issue today, they tend to disagree that HIV /AIDS is much less of a problem than 10 years ago. They are, however, more likely to believe that treatment is very effective (38 percent). They do not tend to see this disease a s one belonging to the third world, the gay community or to drug users exclusively. They are very comfortable in most of the situations involving people with HIV/AIDS described in the survey (although the degree of comfort is mu ch less when a close friend/ family member or a child is concerned) and are most likely to say that they personally could be friends with someone with HIV/AIDS. Representative members of th is group generally believe that people living with HIV/AIDS should be able to serve the pu blic (although, even among this group, 23 percent disagree that they should be allowed to be dentists). This segment is unlikely to blame people living with HIV/AIDS for contracting t his disease and is most apt to support the rights of those with HIV/AIDS to employment, health care, housing, and to being sexually active (although they support the right to be sexua lly active to a lesser degree). This group opposes the publishing of names of people living wi th HIV/AIDS more often than average. They are more likely than the other segments to beli eve that people with HIV are unwilling to tell others about their illness due to the stigma a ssociated with the disease. Similarly, members of this group are more likely than average to suggest that people with HIV/AIDS can experience difficulty getting housing, health care and employment. They also believe that seeing this disease as one exclusively affecting dr ug users or the gay community, as well as fear of becoming infected with HIV through casual c ontact are strong factors in peoples' discomfort with HIV/AIDS. They are marginally more likely than members of the other groups to report getting their HIV/AIDS information from television news or websit es. They place a high degree of reliability on health care professionals, the Public Health Age ncy of Canada and Health Canada, as well as (to a lesser degree) the Government of Canada, a nonymous clinics, and people living with HIV/AIDS. Members of this group are also more likel y than the other segments to feel comfortable seeking information from people with HI V/AIDS or an anonymous clinic. This group is most likely (by far) than average to belie ve that social media is the most efficient way to provide people with information about HIV/AIDS. This group is more likely than others to say that th ey know (or have known) someone with HIV/AIDS (48 percent). They are the most likely to be sexually active (80 p ercent are); despite this, this group is no more likely to rate their risk of contracting HIV a s high. Those who rate their risk as low are more apt to say this is because they have only one partner and are not using drugs. 116 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 Nonetheless, they are also the group most likely to report being tested for HIV (43 percent versus 37 percent in the overall sample). This group is slightly overrepresented those who are married with children. The concentration is highest among those aged 25 to 54 years (64 perc ent). This group has a higher than average proportion of individuals with a university education, who are employed full-time and have higher than average household income. This gro up is also under-represented among Quebec residents, and those born outside Canada. The y are also less likely to associate themselves with a particular religion or religious group. 11.2 SEGMENT TWO : INFORMED DISTANCING This segment comprises 20 percent of Canadians, sim ilar to 2006 when it represented 22 percent of the Canadian population. As with the first segment, members of this segment have a high level of knowledge on the topic of HIV/AIDS, althou gh they score slightly lower on the index than the first segment (44 percent scored high compared with 39 pe rcent overall). They score similarly to the rest of the country in terms of the level of stigma and discrim ination they exhibit against people with HIV/AIDS. They are marginally less comfortable than average around people with HIV/AIDS. Apart from a high level of knowledge, the key distinguishing factor for this s egment is the degree to which they see the disease as something that affects others (i.e., a disease affe cting largely gay people, drug users and residents of the third world). They are the second most likely to dis tance themselves from the issue of HIV/AIDS (with 36 percent scoring high on the distance index versus 14 percent in the national sample overall). With respect to knowledge, members of this group ar e less likely than average to be misinformed about methods of transmission and testi ng. They also know that there is no cure, that HIV/AIDS is manifested by an inability of the body to defend itself and that the onset of AIDS may not occur for ten years or more after cont racting HIV. This group is more apt to minimize HIV/AIDS to some degree. Specifically, they are somewhat more likely than most of the other segments to view it as a moderate rather than a serious problem today. Forty-four percent agree that HIV is much less serious than it was ten years ago, compared with 33 percent on average. There are few significant differences between this g roup and Canadians overall in terms of their comfort and views regarding most scenarios in volving a person with HIV/AIDS, although, as noted earlier, they are less comfortable with ea ch of the scenarios proposed in the survey than segments one and three, particularly comfort l evels with a child attending a school where one if the students was known to have HIV/AIDS and with a close friend or family member dating someone with HIV/AIDS. Although they believe that people with HIV/AIDS have the same right to employment as others, they are more l ikely than average to believe that people with HIV/AIDS should not be allowed to work as dent ists nor should they have the same rights to be sexually active. This group is the most likely of the five segments to say that it is a responsibility of people with HIV/AIDS to protect o thers. Members of this group believe that EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 117 young men in Canada are increasingly at risk for HI V and are more likely than the Informed Open-Minded (Segment 1) or the Moderately Informed, Open-Minded (Segment 3) to express fear of people with HIV. This segment distances itself from the disease and p refers to view it as a disease that is contained to the third world, the gay community or to drug users. In terms of media preferences, this group is the mo st likely segment to express a preference for obtaining information about HIV/AIDS from websi tes (and Google in particular). This group is marginally over-represented by seniors and those who are retired (27 percent retired versus the national average of 22 percent). There are few other demographic characteristics that distinguish this segment. 11.3 SEGMENT THREE : MODERATELY INFORMED OPEN -MINDED This group includes 23 percent of Canadians, which is on par with this segment's proportion in 2006 (22 percent). They have a low to moderate level of knowledge about HIV/AIDS (34 percent scored low and 66 percent scored in the mid-range), and are mo derately comfortable about contact with people with HIV (20 percent scored low on comfort index compare d with 27 percent overall). They also show few stigmatizing attitudes (84 percent scored low) and are less likely than many other Canadians to distan ce themselves from the issue, disagreeing that AIDS is a disease contained to third world countries, the gay community or drug users (72 percent scored low on t he distancing index versus 52 percent overall). They are also very concerned about the issue of HIV/AIDS (49 percent think it is a very serious problem tod ay) and do not believe that it is a less serious proble m in Canada today than it was ten years ago (46 per cent disagreeing). Overall, they are quite similar to th e first segment, but with a less rich understanding of HIV/AIDS. With respect to knowledge, members of this group ar e more likely than average to be misinformed about methods of transmission and testi ng. In particular, they are less informed about oral sex or from mother to newborn as methods of transmitting HIV. They also are more apt than the overall average to think that HIV can be diagnosed through physical examination and that it can be cured, particularly this early d iagnosis. They also are less likely to know that, with HIV/AIDS, the body cannot defend itself agains t diseases and that AIDS may not occur for ten years or more after contracting HIV. In terms of comfort with various situations, they a re most likely to reflect national results, except that they are considerably less likely than the average to blame or to fear people living with HIV/AIDS. This group strongly believes in the h uman rights of people living with HIV/AIDS and opposes any discrimination. They also report sup portive reactions to having someone with HIV/AIDS as a close friend or attending school with their child. 118 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 This segment is average with regard to their overall pattern of receiving information about HIV/AIS, as well as their preferred sources of gett ing information; however, this group is less apt to rate both the Government of Canada, and an a nonymous clinic as reliable sources for information. They also report higher than average c omfort with friends and family as information sources. This group reports an average likelihood of knowing a person living with HIV/AIDS (40 percent). There are few significant differences for this group from the average in terms of sexual behaviour or testing behaviour. They also hav e an average perceived risk of contracting the disease. Demographically, there is little about this group t hat sets them apart from other Canadians. They are marginally over-represented in Quebec. They are also somewhat less apt to be associated with a particular religion or group. 11.4 SEGMENT FOUR : MODERATELY INFORMED DENIERS /F EARFUL This segment comprises 12 percent of Canadians, sim ilar to 2006 (11 percent). The segment is characterized by a low to mid-level knowledge ab out HIV/AIDS (59 percent scored low on the knowledg e index versus 19 percent overall), strong levels of discomfort around people with HIV/AIDS (68 percent scored low on the comfort index versus 27 percent overall), and the highest degree of sti gmatizing attitudes (40 percent scored high on the stigma index compare d with the seven percent national average). Members of this segment tend to minimize and greatly distan ce themselves from the issue (47 percent scored hig h on this measure, compared with only 14 percent in the national average) and are most likely to support discrimination of people living with HIV/AIDS (49 p ercent scored high on this measure compared to only 15 percent overall). This group is more likely than average to be misinfo rmed about some methods of transmission and testing. They are less likely than average to c ite homosexual men and injection drug users as among the most affected groups and more apt than average to believe that people of African descent are most affected by HIV. They are a lso more apt than others to believe that there is a cure for HIV/AIDS and that the illness c an be diagnosed through physical examination and self-diagnosis. This group is more l ikely than others to recognize their low levels of knowledge on this topic. They are more likely than average to believe that AI DS is much less of a problem in Canada today than it was ten years ago (50 percent versus 33 percent overall), and that AIDS is a disease belonging to the third world, the gay commu nity and drug users. As part of strong discriminatory views of HIV/AIDS, this group strongly disagrees that people with HIV/AIDS should serve the public as a hairstyl ist or dentist (33 and 52 percent, EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 119 respectively), or that they should have the same ri ghts to employment, health care, or housing. A majority of this segment (50 percent versus 22 pe rcent overall) believes that people with HIV have no right to be sexually active, and that their names should be made public to mitigate the risk to others (35 percent versus 10 percent overal l). They are the most uncomfortable around people with H IV/AIDS and the most likely to say that they could not be friends with someone who has AIDS . They are most likely to believe that people who contract HIV/AIDS through sex or drug us e, get what they deserve and have only themselves to blame for it. Members of this group a re more likely than average to say they feel anger (23 percent versus 5 percent overall) and are afraid of people with HIV (48 percent versus 15 percent average). This group expresses a slightly higher than average preference for information from television shows and the radio. They are somewhat less apt to rely on doctors, the government, an anonymous clinic, or a person living with HIV/AIDS as sources of information about HIV/AIDS. They tend to place greater than average confidence i n the information provided by their friends and would be most uncomfortable seeking information from a range of sources including doctors, pharmacist, and other health care provider s, and, in particular, a person with HIV/AIDS (40 percent rate themselves uncomfortable with this source). While this segment rates PSAs on television as the most effective sour ce of information, they are more apt than other Canadians to cite PSAs in the newspaper as an effective vehicle for getting this information across. They are least likely to report knowing someone with HIV/AIDS than any other group of Canadians (although 23 percent say that they do kno w someone), and they are more likely than other segments to say that they would react by spending less time with someone they knew had HIV/AIDS. As with the Uninformed Uncomfort able (the next group described), they are unlikely to have been tested for HIV/AIDS (26 p ercent tested compared to 37 percent overall), although they provide the highest rating for perceived personal risk of contracting the disease. This group has a significantly higher than average p roportion of senior citizens (as high as that found in the Uninformed Uncomfortable at 32 percent ) and retired (31 percent) and has lower than average education and income (but not quite as low as the last segment). This segment is also overrepresented by individuals living alone (24 percent). This group is also over- represented among Quebec residents, visible minorit ies and those born outside Canada (particularly from South or East Asia). They also st and out in their self-identification as a visible minority (15 percent) or person with a disability ( 11 percent). Like the Uninformed Uncomfortable (Segment 5), 40 percent of this group is strongly associated with a religious group. 120 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 11.5 SEGMENT FIVE : UNINFORMED UNCOMFORTABLE This segment comprises only four percent of Canadia ns, which is similar to the seven percent they represented in 2006. Individuals in this group are characterized by the lowest knowledge about HIV/AIDS by far (100 percent scored in the lowest r ange of the knowledge index, compared with 19 perce nt of Canadians overall). They also have the second hi ghest level of rated discomfort around people livin g with HIV/AIDS (72 percent scored low versus 27 percent in the overall sample). This group is li kely to distance themselves from the issue of HIV/AIDS, believing th at it is a disease found mostly in third world coun tries, and among the gay population and drug users (64 per cent scored moderate and 20 percent scoring low on the distance measure compared to 35 percent moderat e and 52 percent low in the national average). They express high levels of stigma (23 percent scored hi gh on this measure compared to 7 percent overall) a nd are inclined to discriminate against people living with HIV/AIDS (57 percent scored high compared to 15 percent overall). In terms of knowledge, this group is the most misin formed about methods of transmission and testing, as well as about groups most affected by H IV. Over half of this group believes that there is a cure for HIV/AIDS and they are the least apt to know that, with HIV, the body cannot defend itself against disease and infection. They te nd to believe that HIV/AIDS is less of a problem today that it was ten years ago. They express the greatest discomfort of any segment in any situation involving a person with HIV/AIDS (even wearing a sweater once worn by a per son living with HIV/AIDS makes half of this segment very uncomfortable) and are most apt t o believe that people with HIV get what they deserve. They are less apt to report knowing so meone with HIV/AIDS than average, and are more likely than others to fear and feel anger towards people with HIV. They are the most opposed to the idea of people with HIV/AIDS serving the public (55 percent said that people should not work in such positions as dentists and hairstylists), or having any equal rights to employment, health care, or even ho using, as compared to other segments. They are also more apt than others to deny any negat ive impacts of stigma and discrimination on the person and society (i.e., less apt to say th at people with HIV/AIDS have greater difficulty accessing services or finding employment or being willing to tell others about their disease). This group does not have strong singular patterns in terms of where they receive information about HIV/AIDS, although there is a somewhat higher concentration of individuals in this segment who receive the information from books/at t he library (13 percent). Preferences for information channels are slightly more concentrated in more traditional vehicles such as television, magazines and newspaper articles. They a re less apt to use the Internet than other segments. They are characterized by the greatest sce pticism of doctors or pharmacists, the government (including Public Health Agency and Heal th Canada), as well as people with HIV/AIDS. They are most apt of any group to view fam ily and friends as reliable sources of information about HIV/AIDS. This group is least lik ely to feel comfortable seeking information EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 121 from health care professionals, anonymous clinics, or a person with HIV. Brochures/ information kits sent to the home stands out as the best approach for this group (according to 56 percent of this segment). This group includes a much higher than average number of senio r citizens (34 percent of this group are over 65 years of age). There is also a con siderably higher concentration than average of individuals that are either unemployed, and looking for work (12 percent), or retired (35 percent) in this segment. Thirty-two percent al so have less than high school completion and 26 percent report household incomes of less tha n $20,000. There is a higher than average concentration of individuals who describe t hemselves as single with no children and living with family (18 percent). Members of this segment are found in higher concent rations than average among Quebec residents. There also is a higher proportion than av erage who were born outside Canada, more often than average reporting themselves to be coming from Arab states (four percent). There is also a higher than average concentration of individuals classifying themselves as an Aboriginal person or a person with a disability. Members of this group are more likely than average to strongly associate themselves with a particular religion or a religious group (46 percen t compared to 28 percent overall). EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 123 12. PROFILE ON BABY BOOMERS An additional profile was created for differences in survey results for respondents who are considered to be Baby Boomers (boomers) by virtue o f their age. This includes all survey respondents between 48 and 66 years of age. Knowledge Baby boomers' level of knowledge about HIV/AIDS is on par with the general Canadian public, and they share a similar level of concern over the seriousness of HIV/AIDS in Canada today, although they are more likely than younger age coho rts to perceive heart disease and diabetes as very serious. This group is more likely than Canadians overall to name homosexual men and injection drug users as groups that have been affected by HIV/AIDS . Risk Boomers are less likely than Canadians overall to h ave used a condom the last time they had sex (10 percent did, compared to 21 percent overall ); most frequently cited reasons are: because they are married or in a monogamous relatio nship (80 percent compared to 73 percent overall). They are also less likely than the general population to have had a casual sex partner (eight percent have, versus 15 percent overall). Boomers are more likely to perceive their personal risk of contracting HIV/AIDS to be quite low (92 percent say their risk is low, compared to 87 p ercent of all age groups saying this). No boomers consider themselves to be at high risk for contracting hepatitis C. This group is less likely to have ever been tested f or HIV/AIDS (30 percent have, compared to 37 percent overall in the general population). This age cohort is most likely to have known someone with HIV/AIDS (48 percent, compared to 40 percent of Canadians overall). Stigma and Discrimination Boomers (60 percent) are more likely than the avera ge Canadian (55 percent) to say that people with HIV/AIDS can experience difficulty gett ing housing, health care and employment because of stigma. This group is not significantly different from the g eneral population on other measures of stigmatizing or discriminating views towards HIV/AI DS and people living with the disease. 124 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 Comfort Boomers are less likely to believe that the fatalit y of the disease is a strong factor in people's discomfort with the disease (54 percent, compared t o 60 percent overall). Information Boomers are more likely than younger Canadians to h ave heard about HIV/AIDS through newspapers articles (38 percent, compared to 31 per cent overall and 22 percent among younger generations of Canadians). Boomers are marginally more likely than the average Canadian to feel that a pharmacist is a reliable source of information about HIV/AIDS (75 p ercent versus 70 percent of Canadians overall) and the average boomer is more likely to f eel comfortable seeking this information from a pharmacist (62 percent, versus 55 percent of Canadians). Boomers are also more likely to feel that a person living with HIV/AIDS is a reliable source of information about the disease (60 percent, compared to 55 percent of Canadians overall). Though the proportions are still high, boomers (84 p ercent) are even more likely than other Canadians (79 percent) to say they would feel comfo rtable going to their doctor or a health care professional for information about HIV/AIDS. To a lesser degree, boomers consider family members to be a reliable information source (30 percent, compared to 25 percent of Canadians ov erall) and boomers are more likely to be comfortable getting their information from family ( 38 percent, versus 33 percent of Canadians overall). Hepatitis C As a group, boomers are generally on par with the r est of the Canadian public when it comes to their perceived knowledge level regarding hepati tis C, their perception of their own personal risk, and their actual knowledge of risk factors an d methods of transmission. Boomers are less apt to think people in their age g roup are likely to be affected by hepatitis C as those of other ages: only nine percent of boomer s agree with the statement: \"People in your age group are more likely to become infected with t he hepatitis C virus than those in other age groups,\" compared to 18 percent overall that say th is (and 24 percent among those younger than boomers). They are also somewhat more likely to say that blood recipients are at a high risk of contracting hepatitis C than younger age co horts. This cohort is more likely than other Canadians to b e aware that drug users are a group at risk of being infected by hepatitis C (33 percent know t his, compared to 27 percent of all Canadians). EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 125 13. RESULTS FOR ABORIGINAL CANADIANS In this chapter, results are presented for Aborigi nal Canadians overall, with key differences between Aboriginal Canadians in the survey sample a nd the general Canadian public overall highlighted. Key differences are also presented between four Abo riginal sub-groups (First Nations living on reserve, First Nations living off-reserve, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis) as co mpared to the overall Aboriginal sample. 13.1 KNOWLEDGE The following table presents responses for the 423 Aboriginal respondents compared with the rest of the general public on questions relating to their knowledge of HIV/AIDS. Key differences are n oted below. Aboriginal Canadians (51 percent) are on par with the general Canadian population (47 percent) when it comes to their perception of the s eriousness of HIV/AIDS in Canada today. However, wh ile most Canadians, including Aboriginal Canadians, see cancer and heart disease as the top two very serio us diseases facing Canadians today, Aboriginal Canadia ns are less likely than the general population to s ee these diseases as very serious. Aboriginal Canadians are more likely (21 percent) than the general Canadian population (seven percent) to name Aboriginal people as a grou p that has been particularly affected by HIV/AIDS i n Canada. Aboriginal Canadians are far less likely (3 5 percent) to name homosexual men as a specific gro up that has been affected by HIV/AIDS, compared to 51 percent overall who say this. Aboriginal Canadians are less likely to know that HIV/AIDS cannot be cured (78 percent, compared to 87 percent overall), and treatment for HIV/AIDS is more likely to be viewed by Aboriginal Canadians as not very effective (14 percent) compar ed to eight percent of Canadians overall who say th is. The view that HIV/AIDS is much less of a problem to day than ten years ago is more likely to be held by Aboriginal Canadians (40 percent) compar ed to Canadians overall (33 percent). Despite this, Aboriginal Canadians are more apt to agree that you ng men are increasingly a group at risk for HIV (49 percent, compared to 37 percent overall). This is in contrast to Canadians overall, who view young wome n, more so than young men, as increasingly at risk for HIV/AIDS. 126 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 Table 13.1: Key Results for Aboriginal Canadians - Knowledge Status General Public Aboriginal First Nations on- reserve First Nations off- reserve M\u00e9tis Inuit Is ... a very serious disease in Canada Very serious you know, can someone find out for certai n if they have HIV/AIDS from... ?

This age group is also more likely to rate their knowledge of HIV/AID S highly (38 percent rate their knowledge a 6 or 7 on a 7-point scale, compared to 20 percent o f Aboriginals overall). Aboriginal Canadians age 65 years and older, and th ose with lower levels of education are more likely to think AIDS can be detected by physic al examination or self-diagnosis. Aboriginal Canadians between 55 and 64 years of age are more likely to say that young men are increasingly at risk of HIV/AIDS. Those between ages 35 and 64 years and women are more likely to know that young women are increasing ly at risk of the disease. Aboriginal Canadians under 35 years of age are on par with the Aboriginal averages that say young men and young women are increasingly at risk of HIV/AID S. Men and Aboriginal Canadians living in B.C. and Alb erta are more likely to see HIV/AIDS as less of a problem than it was 10 years ago. First Nations living on-reserve are more likely to b elieve that HIV/AIDS can be cured; despite this, they are also more likely to say that AIDS is always fatal, and they are less likely to feel that treatments are very effective. This group is mo re likely to believe the disease can be detected through physical exam or self-diagnosis. T hey are less likely to know a person can have HIV for 10 years or more without developing AI DS and that HIV/AIDS makes a person susceptible to common illnesses and diseases. This g roup is more likely to feel that HIV/AIDS is a very serious disease. First Nations living off-reserve are more likely to know that young women are increasingly at risk for HIV/AIDS, that people living with HIV/AIDS are more susceptible to illnesses and diseases, and that a person can live with the virus for many years without developing AIDS. This group is more likely to feel that treatments fo r the disease are very effective. M\u00e9tis are more likely to know that HIV/AIDS cannot be cured, even if treated early, and that the disease can be detected through a blood test. Th ey are also more likely to know that people living with HIV/AIDS are more susceptible to illnesses and diseases, and that a person can live with the virus for many years without deve loping AIDS. They are less likely to believe that AIDS is always fatal. Inuit are more likely to see HIV/AIDS treatments as not very effective. They are less likely to know that young women are increasingly at risk for HIV/AIDS, that a person can have HIV for 10 years or more without developing AIDS, and that HIV/AIDS makes a person susceptible to common illnesses and diseases. 128 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 13.2 PERCEPTION OF PERSONAL RISK The following table summarizes responses for the 42 3 Aboriginal respondents compared with the rest of the general public on questions relatin g to their perception of personal risk. Key differe nces are noted below. Aboriginal Canadians are more likely than Canadian s overall to rate their personal risk of contracting HIV as moderate (17 percent versus 11 p ercent in the broader public). They are also more li kely than the general public to agree with the statement , \"HIV/AIDS is mostly a drug user's disease\" (19 pe rcent, compared to 13 percent of the general public). Table 13.2: Key Results for Aboriginal Canadians - Perception of Personal Risk Status General Public Aboriginal First Nations on- reserve First Nations off- reserve M\u00e9tis Inuit HIV/AIDS is mostly a you rate your own personal risk of contra cting HIV, using a scale where 1 is a very low risk , 7 is a very high risk and the midpoint 4 is Canadians who rate their risk of contrac ting HIV/AIDS as moderate are more likely to be younger Aboriginals (under 25 years old), men , and those with no post-secondary education compared with other Aboriginal Canadians. Aboriginal Canadians who rate their personal risk a s high are more likely to be residents of Saskatchewan/Manitoba and between 25-34 years old c ompared with those in other parts of Canada and other age cohorts. First Nations residents living on-reserve are more l ikely than the overall Aboriginal average to agree that \"HIV/AIDS is mostly a gay person's disea se\" and that \"HIV/AIDS is mostly a third EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 129 world disease\". This group is more likely to rate th eir personal risk as high (six percent, versus two percent of Aboriginals overall). First Nations living off-reserve are less likely tha n other Aboriginal groups to see HIV/AIDS as a disease of the third world, gay people, or drug u sers. M\u00e9tis are more likely than the Aboriginal average t o say their personal risk of HIV/AIDS is low. They are less likely to see HIV/AIDS as mostly a \"th ird world\" or \"gay person's\" disease. Inuit are more likely than other Aboriginal groups to see HIV/AIDS as mostly a drug user's disease. They are also more likely to see it as a th ird world disease. 13.3 STIGMA AND DISCRIMINATION The following table presents the key differences for the 423 Aboriginal respondents compared with the rest of the general public on questions re lating to stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS. Aboriginal people are more likely than the rest of Canadians to agree that they feel anger towards people living with HIV/AIDS (10 percent, ve rsus five percent of the rest of the general public ). They are also more likely than other Canadians to agree that they feel afraid of people living with HIV/AID S (22 percent, compared to 15 percent of the rest of the general public) and to think that \"People who get HIV/AIDS through sex or drug use got what they dese rve\" (17 percent, compared to nine percent of the general public). Although Aboriginal respondents are on par with th e proportion of other respondents in the general public who feel people living with HIV/AIDS should be allowed to serve in public positions suc h as dentists (45 percent), significantly fewer Aborigin al respondents (46 percent) agree that people with HIV/AIDS should be allowed to serve as hairstylists (compared to 65 percent of Canadians overall). It is also less likely for Aboriginal Canadians to agree that people living with HIV/AIDS have the same rights to employment, health care and housing (between 73 and 85 percent of Aboriginal Canadians, compared to between 90 and 95 percent of Canadians overall). The view that people living with HIV/AIDS have a re sponsibility to protect others from getting the disease is less likely to be held by Aboriginal Canadians (72 percent) than it is by Canadians ove rall (86 percent). However, Aboriginal Canadians are more li kely to agree that the names of people living with HIV/AIDS should be made public so that others can a void them (26 percent, versus 10 percent of Canadians overall). Among Aboriginal Canadians, the view that people with HIV/AIDS are unwilling to te ll others about it because of the stigma of the diseas e is less likely to be held (56 percent) than it is among Canadians overall (69 percent). 130 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 Table 13.3: Key Results for Aboriginal Canadians - Stigma and D iscrimination Status General Public n=1,851 (%) Aboriginal n=423 (%) First Nations On- Reserve n=104 (%) First nations Off- Reserve n=103 (%) M\u00e9tis n=102 (%) Inuit n=102 (%) I could not be friends with someone who has HIV/AID S get HIV/AIDS through sex or drug use got what they deserve have HIV/AIDS should be allowed to serve the public in positions like...

RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 131 Those more likely to say they feel anger toward peop le with HIV/AIDS are residents of Saskatchewan/Manitoba and have no post-secondary ed ucation. Aboriginal Canadians who say they feel afraid of pe ople living with HIV/AIDS are more likely to be living in Quebec (39 percent) or Nunavut (44 per cent), versus the rest of Canada (15 percent). Aboriginal Canadians who say they feel af raid of people living with HIV/AIDS are also more likely to be young (under 25 years old) w ith no post-secondary education. People living in Nunavut are more likely than those elsewhere to think that \"People who get HIV/AIDS through sex or drug use got what they dese rve\" and that the names of people living with HIV/AIDS should be made public so that others can avoid them. Men, Aboriginal people under 25 years of age, and t hose living in Quebec are more likely to disagree that people living with HIV/AIDS have the same rights to employment, health care, and housing. Those who disagree that people living with HIV/AIDS have a responsibility to protect others from getting the disease are more likely to be Abor iginal residents living in Nunavut and women. The view that people with HIV/AIDS are unwilling to tell others about it because of the stigma of the disease is less likely to be held by Aborigi nal people living in B.C./Alberta and 35-44 year olds. Aboriginal Canadians in the 25-34 year o ld, 45-54 year old, and 65+ age categories are more likely to feel people with HIV/AIDS are un willing to tell others about it because of the stigma of the disease. Aboriginal Canadians with more education (college o r more) are more likely to feel that people with HIV/AIDS are unwilling to tell others about it because of the stigma of the disease. First Nations living on-reserve and Inuit are more l ikely than those living off-reserve and M\u00e9tis to say they feel afraid of people living with HIV/A IDS and that they couldn't be friends with someone with the disease. They are more likely to fe el that the names of people with HIV/AIDS should be made public. First Nations living on-reserve and Inuit are less l ikely than those living off-reserve and M\u00e9tis to say that people living with HIV/AIDS have the sa me rights to housing, health care, employment and to be sexually active. First Nations living off-reserve and M\u00e9tis are more likely to feel that the stigma around HIV/AIDS makes people with HIV/AIDS unwilling to te ll others they have the disease and makes them experience difficulty getting housing, h ealth care and employment. 132 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 13.4 COMFORT The following table presents the key differences fo r the 423 Aboriginal respondents compared with the rest of the general public about their com fort level when it comes to issues related to HIV/A IDS. Aboriginal Canadians are less likely than Canadian s overall to feel comfortable in various situations where they might interact with someone l iving with HIV/AIDS. Between 35 and 66 percent woul d be comfortable in situations ranging from their chi ld attending school with another child known to hav e HIV/AIDS, to working in an office where someone has HIV/AIDS, compared to 46 to 81 percent of Canadians overall who would be comfortable in these situations. Aboriginal Canadians would be less lik ely to offer support if they found out a close friend h as HIV/AIDS (81 percent) compared to 91 percent of Canadians overall. Aboriginal Canadians are less li kely than Canadians overall to think that discomfor t with HIV/AIDS stems from its association with drug use ( 48 percent, versus 56 percent of Canadians).

In some situations, like shopping at a grocery store where the owner had HIV/AIDS, or working in an office where someone has HIV/AIDS, Aboriginals under 25 years old are also more likely to be uncomfortable. Those who say they would avoid the friend rather tha n offer support are more likely to be Aboriginal people without post-secondary education. First Nations people living on-reserve and, to an ev en greater extent, Inuit, are generally less likely to be comfortable in many of the situations tested where they might encounter a person with HIV/AIDS. First Nations living off-reserve and M\u00e9tis are often more likely to be comfortable in situations where they might encounter a person with HIV/AIDS. First Nations living off-reserve are more likely to think that some people's discomfort with HIV/AIDS comes from the fact that AIDS is fatal, an d fear that it can be spread through casual contact. If they found out a close friend had HIV/AIDS, First Nations living off-reserve are more likely to say they would offer that person support, while Inu it and First Nations on-reserve are more likely to say they would avoid this person. First N ations on-reserve and Inuit are also more likely to say they would avoid an office co-worker with HIV/AIDS, rather than offer support. 134 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 13.5 INFORMATION NEEDS The following table presents the key differences fo r Aboriginal respondents compared with the rest of the general public on questions about their preferences and needs regarding HIV/AIDS informati on. Aboriginal Canadians are less likely than Canadians overall to have previously heard, seen or read information about HIV/AIDS from newspaper articles (20 percent versus 31 percent for the general publi c) or magazines (eight percent, versus 14 percent overall ). Aboriginal Canadians are more likely to heard, s een or read information recently about HIV/AIDS through general advertising (e.g., pamphlets) or doctors (though these proportions are less than 10 percent) . Though the proportion is quite small, Aboriginal Canadians are more likely than other Canadians to h ave heard, seen or read information recently about HIV/AIDS through an AIDS organization or community organization (seven percent, versus two percent overall). When seeking information about HIV/AIDS, Aborigina l Canadians are less likely than Canadians overall to search Google or go to a speci fic website, and are more likely to get information from a nurse, hospital, or health care professional (15 pe rcent versus seven percent of the general public). They are more likely than the broader public to seek out information from an AIDS or community organization (nine percent, versus five percent of the general p ublic). Aboriginal Canadians are more likely than Canadian s overall to be sceptical about the reliability of information sources like doctors, th e Public Health Agency of Canada, the Government of Canada, and pharmacists, although 41 to 60 percent still judge these sources to be reliable. Friends an d family are more likely to be seen by Aboriginal Can adians as unreliable sources of information (34 to 36 percent of Aboriginals consider these sources unrel iable, compared to 18-23 percent of Canadians overa ll). It is more likely for Aboriginal Canadians than ot her Canadians to feel uncomfortable about approaching their family doctor/another health prof essional, a pharmacist, and their friends for infor mation about HIV/AIDS (23 to 53 percent of Aboriginal peop le would be comfortable with accessing these source s, compared to 31 to 79 percent of other Canadians). The Internet is more likely to be thought of by Abo riginal Canadians (44 percent) as an effective way to reach people with information abou t HIV/AIDS than it is by other Canadians (36 percen t). Public education announcements in newspapers are le ss likely to be thought of as effective by Aborigin al Canadians (11 percent, versus 18 percent of other C anadians).

Brochures/information kits 53% 34% 27% Aboriginal people living in Ontario are more likely than those elsewhere in Canada to have heard, seen or read information about HIV/AIDS in t he past year from television news or documentaries, newspaper articles, magazines and bo oks. They are also more likely to prefer magazines if they were to look for information abou t HIV/AIDS. Aboriginal residents of Saskatchewan/Manitoba are m ore likely to have gotten information about HIV/AIDS from health magazines or family/frie nds. They would be more likely to search for information about HIV/AIDS on the Internet, and are more likely to be comfortable with approaching a person with AIDS or a pharmacist for information. They are more likely than those elsewhere to trust pharmacists, family, the G overnment of Canada and doctors. They are also more likely to think social media and the Internet are effective ways to reach people about HIV/AIDS (between 52 and 58 percent think the se are effective channels, compared to 38 to 44 percent of Aboriginal Canadians overall). Those in B.C./Alberta would be more likely to use Wi kipedia to find information about HIV/AIDS. They are also more likely than Aboriginal people across Canada to think announcements on television would be an effective w ay to communicate about HIV/AIDS. Aboriginal people living in Nunavut are less likely to look for information about HIV/AIDS online, but instead are much more likely to go to a nurse or health care professional other than a doctor for such information. They are more likely than those elsewhere to say that friends are very reliable for information about HIV/AIDS, b ut they are more likely to feel that family, media and doctors are unreliable. Aboriginal reside nts of Nunavut are more likely than those EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 137 elsewhere to say they would feel very uncomfortable about approaching a person with AIDS, friends, a pharmacist or a doctor about HIV/AIDS. Th ey are more likely to think announcements on television would be effective. Aboriginal Canadians ages 35-44 are more likely tha n those in other age groups to have heard, seen or read information about HIV/AIDS from radio news (15 percent, compared to six percent of Aboriginals overall) as well as websites (53 percent, versus 24 percent of Aboriginals overall), including Google (16 percent, versus six percent of Aboriginals). 45-54 year olds are more likely to have heard, seen or re ad information about HIV/AIDS from television and social media (13 percent, compared t o two percent of Aboriginal Canadians overall). Aboriginal Canadians between 55 and 64 ar e more likely to have heard, seen or read information from newspaper articles and magazines. Aboriginal Canadians between ages 45- 54 years are more likely to look for information ab out HIV/AIDS from an AIDS/community organization. Aboriginal people between 35 and 64 years are more likely than seniors and younger Aboriginal people to feel comfortable approaching a doctor about HIV/AIDS. Aboriginal Canadians who are 45-54 years old are more likely t han other age groups to trust media and doctors for information about HIV/AIDS, while those 65 years of age and older are more likely than other age groups to distrust pharmacists. Abor iginal people ages 35-44 are also more likely to feel comfortable going to an anonymous cl inic, but are less likely to be comfortable with going to their family. Those who are 45-54 year s of age are most likely to feel comfortable going to friends for information on HIV/AIDS. Aboriginal people ages 35 to 54 are also more likel y to think the Internet would be an effective way to communicate about HIV/AIDS; this is consiste nt with this age group also being more likely than other Aboriginals to say they have prev iously heard about HIV/AIDS on the Internet. Aboriginal Canadians between 55 and 64 years of age are more likely to think announcements in magazines and newspapers would be effective ways to communicate about HIV/AIDS, which is consistent with this age group being more likely than other Aboriginals to have previously heard about HIV/AIDS through both of the se means. Aboriginal people with a college education are more likely to have seen advertising or a website about HIV/AIDS in the last year, while thos e with more education are more likely to have heard, seen or read information at work or fro m radio news. Aboriginal Canadians with more education are more likely to say they would ge t information about HIV/AIDS from a website, particularly health-specific websites, and medical journals. Aboriginal Canadians with no post-secondary education are more likely to trus t a person living with HIV/AIDS for reliable information, while those with more education are mo re likely to trust a doctor, pharmacist, and the Government of Canada for reliable information. Those with the highest levels of education think that social media would be effective for comm unicating about HIV/AIDS. Aboriginal men are more likely than women to get in formation about HIV/AIDS from Health Canada. Aboriginal women are more likely than men t o be comfortable with going to a 138 EKOS RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, 2012 pharmacist or a person with HIV/AIDS to get informa tion about the disease. Women are more likely to think information on social media and the Internet would be effective. First Nations living on reserve are less likely to s ay they have previously heard about HIV/AIDS through newspaper articles or general adve rtising. If they were looking for information on this topic, they would be less likel y to look on the Internet and would be more likely to go to a nurse or hospital. They are less l ikely to be comfortable getting information on this topic from their friends, and they are more li kely to think that brochures and information sent to people's homes would be an effective way to communicate about HIV/AIDS. First Nations living off-reserve are more likely tha n other Aboriginal Canadians to have previously heard about HIV/AIDS from a doctor. They would be less likely to go to a nurse or hospital for information on this topic, and would b e more likely to go to a community AIDS organization. They are more likely than other Aborig inal Canadians to think that doctors, the Government of Canada, the Public Health Agency of C anada, and pharmacists are all reliable sources of information on the topic; in contrast, t hey are more likely to consider their family to be unreliable. They are more likely to be comfortabl e seeking information about HIV/AIDS from doctors and pharmacists, and also from a person liv ing with HIV/AIDS. Information about HIV/AIDS in magazines and through social media is m ore likely to be viewed by this group as an effective communication channel. M\u00e9tis are more likely than other Aboriginal people to have previously heard about HIV/AIDS through advertising or an AIDS organization. They wo uld be less likely to go to a nurse or hospital for information on this topic, and would b e more likely to look for information on the Internet. They are more likely than other Aboriginal people to consider sources like doctors and the Government of Canada to be reliable on this topic, whereas they are more likely to see their friends as being unreliable. They are more likely to be comfortable with going to their doctor or talking to their family for information a bout HIV/AIDS, and are more likely to think announcements on the radio would be an effective co mmunication channel on this topic. Inuit are far less likely than other Aboriginal res pondents to say they would consult a website if they needed information about HIV/AIDS; instead the y are much more likely to say they would go to a nurse or hospital (68 percent, versus 15 pe rcent of Aboriginal people overall). On the other hand, they are much less likely to consider a doctor or another health care professional as reliable on the subject of HIV/AIDS (16 percent, versus 53 percent of Aboriginal Canadians overall). They are also much less likely to think th e Government of Canada is reliable on this topic (five percent, versus 41 percent of Aborigina l Canadians overall). They are more likely to consider their family to be unreliable on this topi c, and also are less likely to be comfortable asking approaching family members on this topic. The y are also far less likely to be comfortable with talking to a doctor, pharmacist, f riend or person living with HIV/AIDS about the disease. Public education announcements in news papers are more likely to be seen by this group as an effective communication channel.
