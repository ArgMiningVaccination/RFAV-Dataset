Ayurvedic treatment focuses on preventing diseases by balancing a person's spirit, mind, and body using digestive cleanses, herbal medicine, yoga, massage, and more. Here's what you should know about Ayurveda and the various forms of Ayurvedic treatment. What is Ayurveda? Translating to 'the science of life,' Ayurveda (Ayur is life; Veda is knowledge or science) is the Sanksrit term for an ancient Indian healing system that's been practiced for close to 5,000 years. Ayurveda focuses on the prevention of diseases and its various methods of treatment work to restore the balance between your body\u2014mind and spirit included\u2014and the natural environment. According to ancient Ayurvedic texts, the universe is made up of five earthly elements\u2014air, fire, water, earth, and ether\u2014which combine uniquely to form three doshas (life forces): - Vata, made up of air and ether - Pitta, made up of fire and water - Kapha, made up of earth and water These doshas can express themselves physically, emotionally and mentally, and control everything from your emotions and breathing to movement and digestion. What Are the Benefits of Ayurveda? Every person exists as a combination of these three doshas, though aspects of one dosha typically tend to dominate. Balancing the doshas leads to the creation of a positive relationship between body, mind, and the universe and can result in: - Increase in mental wellbeing - Decrease in stress - Increase in energy levels An imbalance in any one these doshas, however, results in disease. What Are Some of the Different Ayurvedic Treatments? Instead of concentrating on healing a disease, Ayurvedic practitioners focus on restoring the balance between the three doshas, which in turn will help you recover. An Ayurvedic treatment plan to re-establish harmony within the patient's body and mind can include: - changes to diet and nutrition - digestive and bowel cleanses (panchakarma) - use of herbal medicines - massage (abhyanga) - yoga and breathing techniques - meditation What to Expect During Your Ayurvedic Treatment Determining your doshas is the first step in any Ayurvedic treatment\u2014Cary Disc Center will ask a series of thorough questions about all aspects of your life.
