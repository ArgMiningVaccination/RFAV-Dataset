Discard any unused vaccine 6 hours after dilution. PREPARATION OF INDIVIDUAL 0.3 mL DOSES OF PFIZER -BIONTECH COVID -19 VACCINE Using aseptic technique, cleanse the vial stopper with a single- use antiseptic swab, and withdraw 0.3 mL of the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine preferentially using a low dead- volume syringe and/or needle. Each dose must contain 0.3 mL of vaccine. If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.3 mL, discard the vial and any excess volume. Administer immediately. Administration Visually inspect each dose in the dosing syringe prior to administration. The vaccine will be an off -white suspension. During the visual inspection, verify the final dosing volume of 0.3 mL. confirm there are no particulates and that no discoloration is observed. do not administer if vaccine is discolored or contains particulate matter. Administer the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine intramuscularly. Record appropriate date and time. Use within 6 hours after dilution. 0.3 mL diluted vaccine After dilution, vials of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine contain six doses of 0.3 mL of vaccine. Low dead- volume syringes and/or needles can be used to extract six doses from a single vial. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be sufficient volume to extract a sixth dose from a single vial. Irrespective of the type of syringe and needle: Each dose must contain 0.3 mL of vaccine. If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.3 mL, discard the vial and content. Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials. Contraindications Do not administer Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine to individuals with known history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine (see Prescribing Information) . Warnings Management of Acute Allergic Reactions Vaccine recipients should be observed for at least 30 minutes after vaccination for signs of allergic reactions. As with any vaccine, appropriate medical treatment used to manage immediate allergic reactions must be immediately available in the event an acute anaphylactic reaction occurs following administration of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccin e. A second dose should not be given to individuals who have experienced anaphylaxis to the first dose. Myocarditis and Pericarditis Postmarketing data demonstrate increased risks of myocarditis and pericarditis, particularly within 7 days following the second dose. The observed risk is higher among males under 40 years of age than among females and older males. The observed risk is highest in males 12 through 17 years of age. Although some cases required intensive care support, available data from short -term follow -up suggest that most individuals have had resolution of symptoms with conservative management. Information is not yet available about potential long- term sequelae. Vaccine recipients should be advised to avoid strenuous physical activity for two weeks after vaccination. They should be advised to seek medical attention promptly if they develop chest pain, shortness of breath or abnormal heartbeats. Stress -related Responses Some individuals may have stress -related responses associated with the process of vaccination itself. Stress -related responses are temporary and resolve on their own. They may include dizziness, fainting, palpitations, increases in heart rate, alterations in blood pressure, feeling short of breath, tingling sensations, sweating and/or anxiety. Individuals should be advised to bring symptoms to the attention of the vaccination provider for evaluation and precautions should be in place to avoid injury from fainting. The administration of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness. Individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with a bleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection, should not be given Pfizer -BioNTech COVI D-19 Vaccine unless the potential benefit clearly outweighs the risk of administration. Altered Immunocompetence Immunocompromised persons, including individuals receiving immunosuppressant therapy, may have a diminished immune response to Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine . Limitation of Effectiveness As with any vaccine, Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine may not protect all vaccine recipients. Adverse Reactions Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials Adverse reactions following administration of the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine that have been reported in clinical trials include injection site pain, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, fever, injection site swelling, injection site redness, nausea, malaise, lymphadenopathy, asthenia, decreased appetite, hyperhidrosis, lethargy, and night sweats (see Prescribing Information) . Adverse Reactions in Post Authorization Experience Severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, and other hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., rash, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema) , diarrhea, vomiting, and pain in extremity (arm ) have been reported following administration of the Pfizer - BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine outside of clinical trials. Myocarditis, pericarditis, paresthesia, hypoesthesia, and erythema multiforme have been reported following administration of the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine outside of clinical trials. Additional adverse reactions, some of which may be serious, may become apparent with more widespread use of the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine.

As with any vaccine, appropriate medical treatment used to manage immediate allergic reactions must be immediately available in the event an acute anaphylactic reaction occurs following administration of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine. A second dose should not be given to individuals who have experienced anaphylaxis to the first dose. 5.2 Myocarditis and Pericarditis Postmarketing data demonstrate increased risks of myocarditis and pericarditis, particularly within 7 days following the second dose. The observed ri sk is higher among males under 40 years of age than among females and older males. The observed risk is highest in males 12 through 17 years of age. Although some cases required intensive care support, available data from short -term follow -up suggest that most individuals have had resolution of symptoms with conservative management. Information is not yet available about potential long- term sequelae. Vaccine recipients should be advised to avoid strenuous physical activity for two weeks after vaccination. T hey should be advised to seek medical attention promptly if they develop chest pain, shortness of breath or abnormal heartbeats. 5.3 Stress- related Responses Some individuals may have stress- related responses associated with the process of vaccination it self. Stress- related responses are temporary and resolve on their own. They may include dizziness, fainting, palpitations, increases in heart rate, alterations in blood pressure, feeling short of breath, tingling sensations, sweating and/or anxiety. Individuals should be advised to bring symptoms to the attention of the vaccination provider for evaluation and precautions should be in place to avoid injury from fainting. 5.4 Concurrent Illness at Time of Vaccination The administration of Pfizer- BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness. 5.5 Bleeding Precautions Individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with a bleeding disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injection, should not be given Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine unless the potential benefit clearly outweighs the risk of administration. 5.6 Altered Immunocompetence Immunocompromised persons, including individuals receiving immunosuppressant therapy, may have a diminished immune response to Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine. 5.7 Limitation of Effectiveness As with any vaccine, Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine may not protect all vaccine recipients. 6 OVERALL SAFETY SUMMARY It is MANDATORY for vaccination providers to report all vaccine administration errors, all serious adverse events, cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS) in adults and children, and hospitalized or fatal cases of COVID -19 following vaccination with the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine. In clinical studies with a data cut -off of March 13, 2021, adverse reactions in participants 16 years of age and older that received 2 doses included pain at the injection site (84.3%), fatigue (64.7%), headache (57.1%), muscle pain (40.2%), chills (34.7%), joint pain (25.0%), fever (15.2%), injection site swelling (11.1%), night sweats (0.1%). In a clinical study, adverse reactions in adolescents 12 through 15 years of age that received 2 doses included pain at the injection site (90.5% ), fatigue (77.5%), headache (75.5%), chills (49.2%), muscle pain fever (24.3%), joint pain (20.2%), injection site swelling (9.2%), site redness (8.6%), lymphadenopathy (0.8%), and nausea (0.4%) . A higher frequency of pyrexia was observed after the second dose compared to the first dose. Additionally, 306 existing Phase 3 participants least 18 through 55 years of age received a booster dose of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine approximately 6 months after the second dose in the non- placebo - controlled booster dose portion of Study 2. The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after 2 doses. T he most frequent adverse reactions following administration of a booster dose were injection site pain (> 80%), f atigue (> 60%), headache (> 40%), myalgia chills and arthralgia (> 20%). In Study C4591031 (Study 4), a placebo- controlled booster study, 5,081 participants 16 years of age and older were recruited from Study 2 to receive a booster dose of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine at least 6 months after the second dose. The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after 2 doses. Severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported following administration of th e Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine outside of clinical trials. Myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported following administration of the Pfizer- BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine outside of clinical trials. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice . The safety of the primary series of Pfizer- BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine was evaluated in participants 12 years of age and older in two clinical studies conducted in the United States, Europe, Turkey, South Africa, and South America. Study BNT162 -01 (Study 1) was a Phase 1/2, two- part, dose -escalation trial that enrolled 60 participants , 18 through 55 years of age and 36 participants, 56 through 85 years of age . Study C4591001 (Study 2) is a Phase placebo -controlled, observer -blind, dose-finding, vaccine candidate -selection (Phase 1) and efficacy (Phase 2/3) study that has enrolled approximately 46,000 participants, 12 years of age or older. Of these, approximately 44,047 participants (22,026 Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine; 22,021 placebo) in Phase 2/3 are 16 years of age or older (including 378 and 376 adolescents 16 through 17 years of age in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively) and 2,260 adolescents are 12 through 15 years of age (1,131 and 1,129 in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively). Study 2 also included 200 participants with confirmed stable human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; HIV -positive participants are included in safety population disposition but are summarized separa tely in safety analyses. A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 306 adults at least 18 through 55 years of age who completed the primary Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine 2- dose course, received a booster dose of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine a pproximately 6 months (range of 4.8 to 8.0 months) after receiving Dose 2. In Study 2, all participants 12 to <16 years of age, and participants 16 years of age and older in the reactogenicity subset, were monitored for solicited local and systemic reactions and use of antipyretic medication after each vaccination in an electronic diary. Participants are being monitored for unsolicited adverse events, including serious adverse events, throughout the study [from Dose 1 through 1 month (all unsolicited adver se events) or 6 months (serious adverse events) after the last vaccination]. Tables 1 through 8 present the frequency and severity of reported solicited local and systemic reactions, respectively, within 7 days following each dose of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine and placebo. Participants 16 Years of Age and Older - After 2 Doses At the time of the analysis of Study 2 for the interim authorization with a data cut- off of November 14, 2020, there were 37,586 participants (18,801 Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine and 18,785 placebo) 16 years of age or older followed for a median of 2 months after the second dose of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine. At the time of the analysis of Study 2 for the interim authorization with a data cut- off of March 13, 2021, there were 25,651 (58.2%) participants (13,031 Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine and 12,620 placebo) 16 years of age and older were followed up for 4 months after the second dose. The safety evaluation in Study 2 is ongoing. The safety population includes participants 16 years of age and older enrolled by October 9, 2020, and includes safety data accrued through March 13, 2021. Demographic characteristics in Study 2 were generally similar with regard to age, gender, race, and ethnicity among participants who received Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine and those who received placebo. Overall, among the total participants who received either Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine or placebo , 50.9% were male and 49.1% were female, 82.0 % were White, 9.6% were Black or African American, 25.9% were Hispanic/Latino, 4.3% were Asian, and 1.0% were American Indian or Alaska Native. Solicited Local and Systemic Adverse Reactions In participants 16 through 55 years of age after receiving Dose 2, the mean duration of pain at the injection site was 2.5 days (range 1 to 70 days), for redness 2.2 days (range 1 to 9 days), and for swelling 2.1 days (range 1 to 8 days) for participants in the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine group. In participants 56 years of age and older after re ceiving Dose 2, the mean duration of pain at the injection site was 2.4 days (range 1 to 36 days), for redness 3.0 days (range 1 to 34 days), and for swelling 2.6 days (range 1 to 34 days) for participants in the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine group.

Unsolicited Adverse Events Upon approval of the interim authorization for Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine, participants were unblinded to offer placebo participants Pfizer- BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine. A dverse events are reported as incidence rates per 100 person- years to account for the variable exposure since unblinding began in a phased manner for participants in the study. Adverse events detailed below for participants 16 years of age and older are for the placebo -controlled blinded follow -up period up to the participants' unblindi ng dates. Serious Adverse Events In Study 2, among participants 16 through 55 years of age who had received at least 1 dose of vaccine or placebo ( Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine = 12,995; placebo = 13,026), serious adverse events from Dose 1 up to the participant unblinding date in ongoing follow -up were reported at an incidence rate of 2.1 per 100 person- years among Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine recipients and 2.4 per 100 person- years among placebo recipients. In a similar analysis, in participants 56 years of age and older ( Pfizer- BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine = 8,931, placebo = 8,895), serious adverse events were reported at an incidence rate of 4.9 per 100 person- years among Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine recipients and 4.6 per 100 person- years amo ng placebo recipients who received at least 1 dose of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine or placebo, respectively. In these analyses, 58.2% of study participants had at least 4 months of follow -up after Dose 2. Among participants with confirmed stable HIV i nfection serious adverse events from Dose 1 up to the participant unblinding date in ongoing follow -up were reported at an incidence rate of 6.6 per 100 person- years among Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine recipients and 6.9 per 100 person- years among placebo recipients. There were no notable patterns between treatment groups for specific categories of serious adverse events (including neurologic, neuro- inflammatory, and thrombotic events) that would sugge st a causal relationship to Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine. Non-Serious Adverse Events In Study 2 in which 12,995 participants 16 through 55 years of age received Pfizer- BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine and 13,026 participants received placebo, all events, wh ich include non- serious adverse events from Dose 1 up to the participant unblinding date in ongoing follow -up were reported at an incidence rate of 88.4 per 100 person- years among participants who received Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine and 43.5 per 100 person- years among participants in the placebo group, for participants who received at least 1 dose. In a similar analysis, in participants 56 years of age and older (Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine = 8,931, placebo = 8,895), all events, which include non- serious adverse events were reported at an incidence rate of 75.7 per 100 person- years among participants who received Pfizer- BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine and 43.3 per 100 person- years among participants in the placebo group, for participants who received at least 1 dose. Among participants with confirmed stable HIV infection, all events, which include non -serious adverse events from Dose 1 up to the participant unblinding date in ongoing follow -up were reported at an incidence rate of 95.8 per 100 person- years among participants who received Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine and 52.0 per 100 person- years among participants in the placebo group, for participants who received at least 1 dose. In these analyses, 58.2% of study participants had at least 4 months of follow -up after Dose 2. The higher frequency of reported unsolicited non- serious adverse events among Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine recipients (inclusive of stable HIV infection) compared to placebo recipients was primarily attributed to local and systemic adverse events reported during the first 7 days following each dose of vaccine that are consistent with adverse reactions solicited among participants in the reactogenicity subset and presented in Tables 3 and 4. Throughout the placebo- controlled safety follow -up period to date, Bell's palsy (facial paralysis) was reported by 4 participants in the Pfizer- BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine group and 2 participants in the placebo group. Onset of facial paralysis was Day 37 after Dose 1 (participant did not re ceive Dose 2) and Days 3, 9, and 48 after Dose 2. In the placebo group the onset of facial paralysis was Day 32 and Day 102. Currently available information is insufficient to determine a causal relationship with the vaccine. There were no other notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for specific categories of non -serious adverse events (including other neurologic or neuro- inflammatory, and thrombotic events) that would suggest a causal relationship to Pfizer- BioNTech COVID- 19 Vac cine. Adolescents 12 Through 15 Years of Age - After 2 Doses In an analysis of long- term safety follow -up in Study 2, 2,260 adolescents (1,131 Pfizer- BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine; 1,129 placebo) were 12 through 15 years of age. Of these, 1,559 (786 Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine and 773 placebo) adolescents have been followed for 4 months after the second dose of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine. The safety evaluation in Study 2 is ongoing. Demographic characteristics in Study 2 were g enerally similar with regard to age, gender, race, and ethnicity among adolescents who received Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine and those who received placebo. Overall, among the adolescents who received the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine, 50.1% were ma le and 49.9% were female, 85.9% were White, 4.6% were Black or African American, 11.7% were Hispanic/Latino, 6.4% were Asian, and 0.4% were American Indian/Alaska Native. Solicited Local and Systemic Adverse Reactions The mean duration of pain at the injection site after Dose 1 was 2.4 days (range 1 to 10 days), for redness 2.4 days (range 1 to 16 days), and for swelling 1.9 days (range 1 to 5 days) for adolescents in the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine group.

Unsolicited Adverse Events In the following analyses of Study 2 in adolescents 12 through 15 years of age (1,131 of whom received Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine and 1,129 of whom received placebo) , 98.3% of study participants had at least 30 days of foll ow-up after Dose 2. Serious Adverse Events Serious adverse events from Dose 1 through up to 30 days after Dose 2 in ongoing follow -up were reported by 0.4% of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine recipients and by 0.1% of placebo recipients. There were no notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for specific categories of serious adverse events that would suggest a causal relationship to Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine. P sychiatric -related serious adverse events were numerically higher in the vaccine group, 4 recipients (3 [0.3%] with depression and 1 [0.1%] with suicidal ideation) and none in the placebo group. The events in the vaccine group were confounded by prior medi cal history as all 4 participants had concurrent psychiatric illness including depression prior to vaccination. Currently available information is insufficient to determine a causal relationship with the vaccine. Non-Serious Adverse Events Non-serious adverse events from Dose 1 through up to 30 days after Dose 2 in ongoing follow -up were reported by 5.8% of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine recipients and by 5.8% of placebo recipients. There were no notable patterns between treatment groups for specific categories of non -serious adverse events that would suggest a causal relationship to Pfizer- BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine. Participants 16 Years of Age and Older - After Booster Dose In Study 4, a placebo -controlled booster study, participants 16 years of age and older recruited from Study 2 received a booster dose of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine (5,081 participants), or placebo (5,044 participants) at least 6 months after the second dose of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine. Overall, participa nts who received a booster dose, had a median follow -up time of 2.5 months after the booster dose to the cut -off date (5 October 2021). A higher frequency of lymphadenopathy (2.8% vs 0.4%) was observed in participants receiving a booster dose in Study 4 c ompared to participants receiving 2 doses. 6.2 Post Authorization Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post authorization use of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine . Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a p opulation of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to vaccine exposure. Cardiac Disorders: myocarditis, pericarditis Gastrointestinal Disorders: diarrhea, vomiting Immune System Disorders: severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, and other hypersensitivity reactions rash, pruritus, Disorder: higher frequency of pain in extremity (1.1% vs. 0.8%) was observed in participants receiving a booster dose in Study 4 co mpared to participants receiving 2 doses. 8 REQUIREMENTS AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS AND VACCINE ADMINISTRATION ERRORS See Overall Safety Summary (Section 6) for additional information.

All fatal and life- threatening events are to be reported as soon as possible, within 24 hours. Please report the adverse events to the Vigilance and Compliance Branch at Tel: 6866 1111, Fax: 6478 9069, or report online at https://www.hsa.gov.sg/adverse -events . 10 DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no data to assess the concomitant administration of the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine with other vaccines. 11 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 11.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Available data on Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine administered to pregnant women are insufficient to inform vaccine -associated risks in pregnancy. In a reproductive and developmental toxicity study, 0.06 mL of a vaccine formulation containing the same quantity of nucleoside -modified messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) (30 mcg) and other ingredients included in a single human dose of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine was administered to female rats by the intramuscular route on four occasions: 21 and 14 days prior to mating, and on gestation days 9 and 20. No vaccine -related adverse effects on female fertility, fetal development, or postnatal development were reported in the study. 11.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data are not available to assess the effects of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine on the breastfed infant or on milk production/excretion. 11.3 Pediatric Use Interim Authorization of Pfizer- BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine in adolescents 12 through 18 years of age is based on safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data in this age group and in adults. Interim Authorization of Pfizer- BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine does not include use in individuals younger than 12 years of age. 11.4 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine inclu de participants 65 years of age and older who received the primary series and their data contributes to the overall assessment of safety and efficacy [see Overall Safety Summary (6.1) and Clinical Trial Results and Supporting Data for Interim Authorization (18.1)] . Of the total number of Pfizer- BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine recipients in Study 2 as of March 13, 2021 (N = 22,026), 20.7% (n = 4,552) were 65 years of age and older and 4.2% (n = 925) were 75 years of age and older. The safety of a booster dose of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine in individuals 65 years of age and older is based on safety data in 12 booster dose recipients 65 through 85 years of age in Study 2, 306 booster dose recipients 18 through 55 years of age in Study 2, and 1,175 booster dose recipients 65 years of age and older in Study 4. The effectiveness of a booster dose of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine in individuals 65 years of age and older is based on effectiveness data in 306 booster dose recipients 18 through 55 years of age in Study 2, and an efficacy analysis from participants 16 years of age and older in 9,945 participants in Study 4. 13 DESCRIPTION The Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine is supplied as a frozen suspension in multiple dose vials; each vial must be diluted with 1.8 mL of sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP prior to use to form the vaccine. Each dose of the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine contains 30 mcg of a nucleoside -modified messenger RNA (modRNA) encoding the vir al spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS -CoV- 2. Each dose of the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine also includes the following ingredients: cholesterol), 0.01 mg potassium chloride, 0.01 mg monobasic potassium phosphate, 0.36 mg sodium chloride, 0.07 mg dibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate, and 6 mg sucrose. The diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP) contributes an additional 2.16 mg sodium chloride per dose. The Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine does not contain preservative. The vial stoppers are not made with natural rubber latex. 14 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 14.1 Mechanism of Action The modRNA in the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine is formulated in lipid particles, which enable delivery of the RNA into host cells to allow expression of the SARS -CoV- 2 S antigen. The vaccine elicits an immune respons e to the S antigen, which protects against COVID -19. 18 CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS AND SUPPORTING DATA FOR INTERIM AUTHORIZATION 18.1 Efficacy in Participants 16 Years of Age and Older - After 2 Doses Study 2 is a multicenter, multinational, Phase 1/2/3, randomized, placebo -controlled, observer -blind, dose-finding, vaccine candidate -selection, and efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older. Randomization was stratified by age: 12 through 15 years of age, 16 through 55 years of age, or 56 years of age and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the 56 -year stratum. The study excluded participants who were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological diagnosis of COVID -19. Participants with preexisting stable disease, defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before enrollment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), or hepa titis B virus (HBV). In the Phase 2/3 portion of Study 2, based on data accrued through November 14, 2020, approximately 44,000 participants 12 years of age and older were randomized equally and received 2 doses of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine or placebo. The efficacy analyses included participants that received their second vaccination within 19 to 42 days after their first vaccination. The majority (93.1%) of vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. Participants ar e planned to be followed for up to 24 months, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID -19.

GMTs and 2 -sided 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the mean logarithm of the titers and the corresponding CIs (based on the Student t distribution). Assay results below the LLOQ were set to 0.5 \u00d7 LLOQ. d. GMRs and 2 -sided 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the mean difference of the logarithms of the titers (Group 1 [12 through 15 years of age] - Group 2 [16 through 25 years of age]) and the corresponding CI (based on the Student t distribution). e. Noninferiority is declared if the lower bound of the 2 -sided 95% CI for the GMR is gre ater than 0.67. f. SARS -CoV -2 50% neutralization titers (NT50) were determined using the SARS -CoV- 2 mNeonGreen Virus Microneutralization Assay. The assay uses a fluorescent reporter virus derived from the USA_WA1/2020 strain and virus neutralization is re ad on Vero cell monolayers. The sample NT50 is defined as the reciprocal serum dilution at which 50% of the virus is neutralized. 18.4 Immunogenicity in Participants 18 Years of Age and Older - After Booster Dose Effectiveness of a booster dose of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine was demonstrated by evaluating noninferiority immune responses of SARS -CoV- 2 50% neutralizing titers (NT50) 1 month after a booster dose. In Study 2, an analysis of SARS -CoV -2 NT50 demonstrated noninferior immune responses 1 month after a booster dose compared to 1 month after Dose 2 in participants at least 18 through 55 years of age who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS -CoV- 2 infection up to 1 month after the booster dose, based on prespecified noninf eriority criteria for both GMR and difference in seroresponse rates. Seroresponse for a participant was defined as achieving a 4- fold rise from baseline (before Dose 1) in NT50 (Table 20 and Table 21). The SARS -CoV- 2 NT50 GMR of 1 month after the booster dose to 1 month after Dose 2 was 3.29 (2 sided 97.5% CI: 2.76, 3.91), which met the noninferiority criteria for GMR (lower bound of the 2- sided 97.5% CI > 0.67 and point estimate of the GMR 0.8). A high proportion of participants (99.5%) had ser oresponse 1 month after Dose 3 compared with 98.0% 1 month after Dose 2. The difference in proportions of participants with a seroresponse 1 month after the booster (Dose 3) and 1 month after Dose 2 (Dose 3 minus Dose 2) was 1.5% (2 sided 97.5% CI: - 0.7%, 3.7%), which met the 10% noninferiority criterion (i.e., lower bound of the 2 sided 97.5% CI > - 10%).
