Kanara, dvm, dabvp Final Thoughts 1 4 7 8 102 12 14 16 An Open Letter to the Veterinary Profession Dear Colleagues, For more than a year now, AAHA has been working to address wellbeing from an alternative perspective that utilizes a positive, proactive approach to help create healthy cultures in veterinary practices. AAHA's Healthy Workplace Culture Initiative provides practices with the resources to design and build optimal, customized, healthy cultures. A positive and healthy practice culture fosters individual and practice wellbeing while empowering team members to create harmony and satisfaction in their personal and professional lives. Improving practice culture and team member wellbeing is not an easy process. It doesn't happen overnight. But, practice owners and managers who recognize the need for positive change and embrace the resources provided through AAHA's Healthy Workplace Culture Initiative will experience substantial benefi ts: Decreased employee turnover Increased employee satisfaction and productivity Improved communication Improved individual wellbeing Improved practice reputation Most importantly, a healthier practice culture will improve patient care and client satisfaction. I am proud to be part of an organization that is working to make the world a better place. Through AAHA's Healthy Workplace Culture Initiative, patient care improves, clients are happier, the human-animal bond thrives, practice team members achieve higher degrees of personal and professional satisfaction, and we suddenly have more smiling people and healthy, happy pets... and, the world becomes a better place. For a deeper look at the importance of achieving a healthy practice culture, I invite you to check out our valuable resources and tools available at aaha.org/ culture and to read this booklet, AAHA's Guide to Veterinary Practice Team Wellbeing. Written by various experts in the fi eld of culture and wellbeing, it should serve as a springboard for discussion and lead to actions that will make a diff erence in your personal and professional lives. Sincerely, Michael T. Cavanaugh, DVM, DABVP (Emeritus) CEO, American Animal Hospital Association 1Why Veterinary Caregivers May Be Predisposed to the Challenge of Finding Joy and Fulfillment in Our Profession Michele Gaspar, dvm, dabvp (feline practice), ma, lpc Short-circuiting the hardwiring of veterinary team members Much attention has been given to the apparent increased risk for mental health issues among veterinarians and support staff. A recent report by Nett et al. 1 found U.S. veterinarians at greater risk for mental illness, suicidal thoughts, and depressive episodes than the general population. Statistically, females are at greater risk than males for depression and suicidal thoughts, so the increased reporting of these occurrences among veterinarians may be a reflection of the larger number of women now in the profession. Also, there is additional interest in whether veterinarians have suffered more early traumatic events than other groups and how this might impact mental health. These \"adverse childhood experiences\" (ACEs) include highly dysfunctional, chaotic families; abuse (verbal, emotional, physical, and sexual); and insecure attachment patterns with early caregivers. Increasingly, researchers are considering whether veterinarians as a group are \"hardwired\" differently from those in other health care professions. If so, mental health issues in veterinarians may be the result of a vulnerable individual in a provocative environment. Perfectionism sparks failure One of the more common \"hardwired\" characteristics with which many veterinary team members regularly self-identify is perfectionism. To be clear, perfectionism is not the feeling that one should always strive to do their best under given circumstances; rather, it is the relentless and irrational belief that anything less than a perfect outcome is a personal defeat and failure. Perfectionism is considered an \"early maladaptive schema,\" an unhelpful thought pattern established in childhood through interactions with key adults. While perfectionism has some perceived benefits, such as assisting academic achievement, the ever-operating internal critic of the perfectionist relentlessly pushes for a level of achievement not possible in our imperfect world. Especially in veterinary medicine, where the clinician's desire to help is often thwarted by the realities of client finances or ability to pursue diagnostics and treatments, unchecked perfectionism is particularly malevolent and emotionally damaging. The 3 S's of rewiring veterinary teams Despite perfectionism pervading our profession, there are several ways veterinary teams can work toward improving their mental health: 1. Self-compassion\u2014the ability to treat ourselves intimes of distress as a good friend would, is key toameliorating perfectionism. This nonshaming stance,which realizes that one can only do what time andresources permit, needs to be not only modeledearly in professional education but included in theday-to-day operations of our veterinary hospitalsas well. While it might seem that self-compassionleads to complacency and decreased standards,research shows otherwise . With a self- compassionate stance, high standards are maintained; intrinsicmotivation is increased; there is less fear of failure,so one persists in a given effort; and there is morepersonal responsibility for previous mistak es. Self- compassion is key to building the personal resilienceand emotional wellbeing necessary for sustainableprofessional and personal satisfaction. 2. S elf-care\u2014can make a real difference in day-to-day resilience. Practical lifestyle changes like incorporatingmindfulness and gratitude, practicing yoga, and improvingsleep hygiene are remarkably effective. Additionalinformation on these topics is available in this booklet. 3. Support\u2014there are times when self-compassionand self-care aren 't enough. We need to be open and willing to receive additional help. Supportingand destigmatizing the pursuit of enhanced mentalhealth through psychotherapy and psychiatric care forveterinarians is critically important. It should be clear toall that no one can or should \"white knuckle\" emotionalillness in isolation and that seeking help is a sign ofstrength, not weakness.CHAPTER 1 2Hopefully, understanding these predispositions will give caregivers permission to prioritize self-compassion, self- care, and seeking support to help improve their mental health and wellbeing. Veterinary professionals may be more predisposed to mental health challenges than the general population. By recognizing this potential predisposition, practice team members can take specifi c, positive actions tohelp improve their mental health and wellbeing.

VETERINARY PRACTICE TEAM WELLBEING 3Practical Lifestyle Changes That Can Make a Real Difference . . . and the Data to Back Them Up Marie K. Holowaychuk, dvm, dacvecc, cyt The long days spent caring for pets and their families in practice are challenging enough. Now, with the added pressure of staying connected to clients through postings on social media, communicating through text messaging, and monitoring online reviews, veterinary practice teams have a difficult time \"unplugging.\" With the added stress of balancing finances, family, and other demands, many of us are overextended to the point of collapse. Taking time to prioritize getting enough sleep, staying mindful, and practicing yoga and gratitude sounds farfetched. But investing small moments each day into self-care pays a team and their patients back in huge dividends. Sleep hygiene refers to the \"good habits\" used to ensure falling (and staying) asleep for the suggested eight hours that most adults need to feel rested. Getting a proper night's sleep leads to feelings of physical rejuvenation and has mental health benefits including memory consolidation, task integration, and emotional regulation.HOW TO GET STARTED: Improve sleep hygiene by avoiding caffeine 6 hours before bedtime and setting an alarm for 30 minutes before bedtime to allow time to unwind, relax, and prepare for bed. Electronic devices including cell phones should be kept outside of the bedroom and not used within 1-2 hours of bedtime. Mindfulness is discontinuing the nonstop juggling act and turning awareness to the present moment and a single task, whether it's speaking with a client or simply breathing. When being mindful, attention is focused on the \"here and now,\" a practice that has many physical, cognitive, and emotional benefits. A mindfulness practice has been shown to alleviate anxiety and depression, boost immunity, and manage chronic pain. HOW TO GET STARTED: Practice mindfulness daily by pausing and taking a deep breath before going into an appointment, turning off the music in the car and paying attention during a commute, and engaging in conversations with family and friends without checking one's phone. While it might seem difficult, incorporating appropriate sleep hygiene as well as mindfulness, yoga, and gratitude practices into our busy schedules is possible. More importantly, these activities make measurable improvements in our physical and mental health. CHAPTER 2 4Yoga has many physical benefits, but the physiological, mental health, and emotional paybacks make it that much more worthwhile. A regular yoga practice helps balance metabolism, lower blood pressure, improve digestion, reduce stress, boost concentration, and cultivate calm in the face of adversity. HOW TO GET STARTED: For those starting a yoga practice for the first time, try a gentle hatha or restorative practice, before attempting the more challenging flow or vinyasa classes. Gratitude is arguably the most powerful emotion that overrides negative ones such as anger, frustration, sadness, or envy. When gratitude is truly embodied, people can overcome the uncomfortable thoughts that arise when they criticize themselves or their lives for not being \"better.\" HOW TO GET STARTED: Studies show that a gratitude practice is most powerful when written, so start a daily gratitude practice by keeping a journal with updates that include a list of things that you are most grateful for each day. While it might seem difficult, incorporating appropriate sleep hygiene, mindfulness, yoga, and gratitude practices into the busy schedules of veterinary team members is possible. More importantly, these activities make measurable improvements in our physical and mental health.

VETERINARY PRACTICE TEAM WELLBEING 5How to Continue to Find Joy in Veterinary Practice Kimberly Pope-Robinson, dvm, ccfp We all remember the joy and excitement we felt when we got our acceptance letter to veterinary school or landed our fi rst job in a veterinary hospital. But over time, the challenges of a busy and, at times, emotionally taxing daily practice life can start to diminish the joy. Because of these challenges, we can start blaming and judging ourselves and others inappropriately and unfairly. Do any of these phrases sound familiar? \"I'm a failure,\" \"I should know the answer but I don't,\" \"I deserve to be here.\" staff \"My boss is a horrible leader.\" These thoughts act like \"Sinkers,\" pulling us down until we feel like we're drowning in fear, frustration, and sadness. So how do you deal with the \"Sinkers\"? Recognize\u2014It's not diffi cult to recognize that Sinkers cause us to feel emotions like anger, shame, sadness, resentment, fear, or guilt. What is hard for veterinary caregivers is to recognize that it's normal to feel the pull of the Sinkers when faced with the challenges of life and practice. We're not broken for feeling that way. Embrace\u2014The goal is not to stop the Sinkers from pulling on us, because they always will to some degree. Instead, we need to embrace them by realizing what it is that pulls us down. Then we can off set their downward pull by fi lling our \"Balloons.\" Everyone has diff erent Balloons that, when fi lled, allow us to fl oat resiliently above our fear of failure. These Balloons can be any of the following: Mental\u2014reading a book outside the veterinary fi eld, becoming absorbed in a new hobby Physical\u2014exercising, participating in a group sport, spending time outdoors Emotional\u2014investing in counseling, rekindling an old relationship or starting a new one Spiritual\u2014exploring a faith tradition, meditatinwg, serving others Intuitively, we know that when we care for ourselves, we are stronger, but as hardworking caregivers, we often need permission from ourselves to do so. Connect\u2014When we connect to these Sinkers, we can fi nally give ourselves permission to fi ll our Balloons . . . to take a break, smell the fl owers, go for a walk, call a friend, or say a prayer. Our Sinkers and Balloons are unique to each of us. Creating permission to connect with them can also allow us to reconnect with people in our lives by sharing our vulnerability. Normalizing vulnerability tends to lead to acceptance of both Sinkers and Balloons. This connection can be a palpable healing force within a hospital. The exact solution for an individual's wellbeing is as unique as that person. But when we recognize our Sinkers and Balloons, embrace them as a valid part of who we are, and connect with ourselves and others by giving ourselves permission to fi ll our Balloons, we are on the path to regaining our joy for the profession. HOW TO GET STARTED: Identify an activity that could fi ll each of your mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual Balloons. Identify several scenarios that act as Sinkers for you and write them down. Share these Sinkers with a trusted person who can help you identify them as they're happening and encourage you to fi ll a Balloon to off set the pull of the Sinker. Resources Brown, Bren\u00e9.

CHAPTER 3 6We all entered the veterinary profession because of the joy and satisfaction that providing care to our patients and pet owners brings us. Even if that joy has decreased or left us, we can recapture it! VETERINARY PRACTICE TEAM WELLBEING 7Compassion Fatigue and Burnout: Don't Let Them Win! Rebecca Rose, aas, cvt We are all candidates for burnout and compassion fatigue. Fortunately, there are strategies we can use to head them off. But first, we must understand the causes, symptoms, and differences between these conditions. What is burnout? Burnout is related to the environment or the circumstances around your work. As an example, you may dread going to the practice because the team is inefficient, there is little accountability, you log too many overtime hours, or other appropriate systems are not in place to support a satisfactory work environment. Signs of Burnout Exhaustion Negativity toward tasks Poor work attitude Difficulty concentrating Combating burnout can best be addressed by creating a healthy practice culture and workplace environment. Elements of a Healthy Culture That Can Help Combat Burnout Establishing strong work and personal boundaries Incorporating best management practices Being properly staffed Instituting effective training programs Nurturing accountability What is compassion fatigue? Compassion fatigue is related to the trauma experienced in the care we provide. Enduring day after day of dying patients; grieving or angry pet owners; and financial, diagnostic, or treatment constraints surrounding an animal's care wears on even the most seasoned caregivers in any part of the veterinary hospital. Even in the most positive work environment or practice culture, compassion fatigue affects every team member to some extent, whether we recognize it or not. Signs of Compassion Fatigue Lack of job satisfaction Avoidance of coworkers or clients Increased use of alcohol and drugs Missing work, excessive use of sick days Intrusive imagery (reoccurring dreams of trauma or emotional scenes) Combating compassion fatigue is best done by taking time to focus on ourselves. Internally Focused Actions That Can Help Combat Compassion Fatigue Establishing healthy work and personal boundaries Debriefing with the team after a traumatic experience Discussing the demands and effects of compassion fatigue openly Supporting self-care and healthy personal habits Regularly assessing our levels of stress and following stress reduction strategies Why is burnout easier to talk about than compassion fatigue? Because burnout is directed externally at the work environment, it's much easier to discuss, and it can become commonplace to complain to our coworkers, who will often validate our dissatisfaction. Clearly, this can lead to a negative workplace atmosphere and exacerbate a sinking culture. In the case of compassion fatigue, we can perceive these feelings as a character flaw or a lack of commitment to the profession. Sharing them takes courage and trust in our coworkers. Realize that asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness. How do other caregiving professions manage burnout and compassion fatigue? In human medicine, where there is more research compiled on these topics, nurses, doctors, and medical organizations have taken a three-pronged approach to managing occupational stress: 1. Organizational responsibility to care for staff 2. A commitment among the staff to support each other 3. A personal responsibility for self-care There is no reason veterinary hospitals can't do the same. CHAPTER 4 8HOW TO GET STARTED: Objectively assess your stress level by taking the \"Life Stress Test\" offered by the Compassion Fatigue Awareness Project (www.compassionfatigue.org). Work through the Stressors and Relievers worksheet. Identify your personal and work-related stressors and ways in which you enjoy relaxing and rejuvenating (http://catalystvetpc.com/wp-content/ uploads/2016/04/Identify-relievers-stressors.pdf ). If you feel you have reached a state of burnout or compassion fatigue in which you are overwhelmed, thwarted with anxiety, using drugs to curb the pain, or considering hurting yourself or attempting suicide: 1. Seek help! Find support within your veterinary hospital or beyond. 2. Call, text, or online message the National Suicide Prevention Hotline (1-800-273-8255). 3. Ask if your veterinary team has an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) and use it.Resources Compassion Fatigue Awareness Project. Life Stress Test (compassionfatigue.org/pages/lifestress.html).

All veterinary team members can be affected by burnout and compassion fatigue to some extent. We must not ignore the importance of taking the necessary steps to help mitigate their effects on us. VETERINARY PRACTICE TEAM WELLBEING 9Integrating Concepts from Veterinary Social Work into Our Practices to Improve Workplace Wellbeing Elizabeth Strand, phd, lcsw In a recent study, 41% of veterinary students stated they had wanted to be a veterinarian \"for as long as they can remember.\"1 This vocational commitment can be found almost universally in veterinary team members. People choose veterinary medicine because they care about animals and people. It is not surprising that difficult cases affect the hearts and minds of these dedicated professionals. Veterinarians report distress about ethical conflicts in practice.2,3 Some clients blame and say hurtful things to veterinarians when their own financial resources are insufficient to save their pets.4 Highly bonded, anxious, lonely pet owners facing end-of-life decisions and euthanasia can cause veterinarians to worry about the safety and wellbeing of the owner. Sometimes veterinary teams have to face suspected animal abuse5 or concern for a colleague's wellbeing and competence. These situations involve varying degrees of emotions like anger, sadness, fear, and guilt for everyone involved. These situations cause moral distress and require emotional labor from the veterinary team. Moral distress: when external factors prevent team members from doing what they feel is \"right\"6 Moral distress often arises when there is conflict among team members or with clients about end-of-life decisions, pet quality of life, and standard of care. Over time, repeated morally distressing situations and negative emotions cause compassion fatigue, which arises from the emotional labor these situations require. Emotional labor: the process of managing and concealing emotional expressions7 Emotional labor is a large part of practicing veterinary medicine successfully. Team members may need to express emotions publicly that do not match their private emotions, such as hiding their anger with a client's inability to pay for treatment or concealing distressing emotions from their past to empathize with clients facing the euthanasia of a beloved pet. Emotional labor and moral distress can be exhausting, often creating \"short fuses\" and team conflict. Veterinary team conflict is expected and normal; however, when not managed well, it can impact morale8 and patient care.9 Processes for managing moral distress, emotional labor , and team conflict can overcome obstacles10 These processes allow a team to spend more time in the rewarding emotions of being veterinary medical professionals. These rewarding emotions include gratitude, happiness, confidence, and pride! HOW TO GET STARTED: Steps your practice can take for helping with moral stress, emotional labor, and team conflict including the following: Hold a weekly one-hour \"Moral DE-stress Meeting\" to discuss the following questions in this order: 1. What are the situations this week that made it hard to sleep or put aside thoughts of work when you were at home? 2. What did you do well in that situation? 3. What do you wish you had done differently? 4. What did you learn? 5. Is there anything you are grateful for in this situation, or just in general? 6. Is there anything that was humorous about this situation or in this week that you remember? Provide yearly team training in communication skills and conflict resolution techniques. Establish relationships with mental health resources in your community and have a list of numbers available for clients and team members to help with difficult emotions that are beyond the scope of the veterinary team.

Emotional Regulation in the Workplace: A New Way to VETERINARY PRACTICE TEAM WELLBEING 11Bridging the Gap Between Personal and Cultural Workplace Wellbeing Randy Hall The importance of a positive workplace culture The culture in your practice significantly affects your life. Sometimes it's easy to pretend that we can separate the two or that we can just leave workplace stressors at work, but this is not the case. A growing body of both research and experience demonstrates that leading a healthy, happy life while being part of a stressful or toxic workplace culture is not a realistic expectation.1 What can be done if the culture in the practice falls short of being positive, productive, engaging, and supportive? Veterinary team members should know that there are options short of starting the journey to find a new practice. Be part of the solution: anyone in the practice can engage to be a catalyst for cultural change! One of the biggest stressors in any workplace is a perceived lack of control, which leads to feeling \"trapped.\" Once trapped, many will focus on either \"misery\" or \"escape.\" If escape is not imminent, misery remains and disengagement grows. Being present every day as a positive and productive influence is a key component of feeling more in control and more fulfilled by the work you do. By taking this approach, you are leading by example. Leadership is about behavior more than it is about role or job title. This type of engagement is a key part of feeling more comfortable and gratified by your work. Regardless of your position, consider having a discussion with your practice's leadership regarding the benefits of examining and improving your workplace culture. In the same way that your practice team is probably always looking for ways to improve the quality of medical services for your patients, every practice should also be looking for ways to improve the quality of the practice's workplace environment and culture. HOW TO GET STARTED: These questions can be helpful in facilitating personal and practice team engagement: What do I want in a team member and how can I be that for others? What could others do to make the environment more positive for me and how can I do more of those things for others? What questions can I ask that might get us thinking as a team about how to improve our culture together? Strive for harmony , not balance, in your personal and work life Some experts on culture have stopped using the word \"balance\" when describing personal and work life coexistence. Balance implies that work and leisure each Our personal wellbeing is significantly impacted by our job satisfaction. Our job satisfaction is significantly impacted by our workplace culture. We can take thoughtful and specific steps to improve our overall wellbeing and make our workplace a healthy and happy place to fulfill our passion for helping pets.CHAPTER 6 12take up 50% of a person's thoughts, time, energy, and eff ort. That is seldom, if ever, true in veterinary medicine. However, \"harmony\" can be achieved between work life and personal life by taking steps that produce engagement, fulfillment, value, and connection in life outside of work. HOW TO GET STARTED: Explore a new activity or hobby. Begin volunteering. Read books unrelated to veterinary medicine. Find another sense of purpose that is not directly related to your work. Re-engage, initiate, or nurture relationships. It's tempting to wait until \"you fi nd the time.\" The reality is, that isn't going to happen. Unless there is a fi rm commitment on taking fi rst steps toward harmony, few will follow through. The goal is to create engaging meaning outside of work to limit feelings of being out of control or trapped in life overall. By owning and thriving in your personal culture, you can experience harmony with the culture inside of work, even if it has room for improvement. Simply agreeing with these concepts academically will not create a cultural shift inside and outside of work. Neither will waiting until everyone in the practice is on board. Individual team members can make the commitment to themselves, begin engaging in work in a more solutions- oriented manner, and focus on fl ourishing outside of work.

VETERINARY PRACTICE TEAM WELLBEING 13What Exactly Is \"Workplace Culture,\" and Why Is Everybody Talking About It? Edward W. Kanara, dvm, dabvp The value of a healthy culture You may have noticed more discussion recently regarding \"workplace culture,\" from continuing education programs at major veterinary conferences to the national media. So why is everybody talking about it? The answer is pretty simple: a healthy, optimized culture, whether in a veterinary practice or a Fortune 500 company, is good for business and enhances employee satisfaction and morale. It's no surprise that companies recognized as employers of choice and for their outstanding customer service place a high priority on ensuring they have a culture that fi ts their business and employee needs. For example, Ritz-Carlton Hotels and Disney have internal employee groups that focus entirely on shaping and monitoring their company culture. According to the Ritz-Carlton Leadership Center, happy employees are 12% more productive, stay in their roles longer, and use fewer sick days. Ritz-Carlton even has an employee position entitled director of culture transformation.1There is also a correlation between personal wellbeing and workplace culture. Think about the anxiety you have felt when you were going to a workplace you dreaded instead of one you enjoyed. We all need to feel purpose in our job and want to feel heard and respected. High-performing teams are more engaged and productive. V irtually every member of the practice team chose his or her career because of a genuine passion for helping pets. It's extremely diffi cult for those team members to separate who they are from what they do, so when they are immersed in an unhealthy culture, their wellbeing is particularly at risk. So, what do we really mean by \"workplace culture\"? If you asked 10 diff erent people (including experts) that question, you would likely receive 10 diff erent answers. Often, we equate employee satisfaction or client-centric attitudes with culture. While these descriptors are important to a healthy culture, they are actually the outcome of a good culture. Culture has been described as the overall character Having a healthy practice culture is essential to providing the best patient care possible and optimizing employee job satisfaction and wellbeing.

It is exemplifi ed by the sum of the values, traditions, behaviors, attitudes, and aspirations of an organization or business. The Disney Institute suggests there are four interconnected processes that defi ne organizational culture: employee selection, training, care, and communication.2 For me, the most concise and accurate defi nition is t hat culture is what results from the diligent adherence to established and expected workplace behaviors determined to be essential for achieving the organization's goals, as well as the avoidance of those behaviors that are deemed unacceptable. For a culture to thrive, there must also be a reward system in place for expected behaviors, along with appropriate consequences and accountability for unacceptable behavior. While experts may diff er on the precise defi nition of culture, everyone seems to know when they work in a healthy culture and when they work in a toxic culture. Can you design and shape an organization's culture or does it just happen? Yes and yes . . . if an organization does not take the time and eff ort to determine its culture, a \"rogue\" culture will emerge whether we recognize it as such or not. Often, when we just let culture happen, it's characterized by ambiguity, lack of consistency of job expectations, and frustration over what may be perceived as a lack of leadership from practice owners or managers. The good news is there is a pathway of well-established processes that can be followed to assess the current practice culture, design and shape a practice's aspirational culture, and then execute the specifi c steps necessary to implement a customized, optimal, healthy culture. Who's responsible for developing a healthy practice culture? Since every business or organization already has an established culture, we are really talking about culture transformation. This may run the gamut from taking a toxic culture to a healthy one or incrementally improving an already good culture to make it a great one. Ultimately, the responsibility for driving culture transformation is that of the practice's leadership team. This starts as a top-down eff ort because practice leadership must see the value, have an appreciation for the eff ort required, and enthusiastically champion what's in it for the entire practice team as well as what's in it for patients and pet owners. But most importantly, accurately assessing the current culture and implementing an improved one requires that every stakeholder have a signifi cant voice in helping shape the new culture. Without genuine buy-in from the entire team, successful culture transformation will not happen. HOW CAN I GET STARTED transforming my practice's culture and taking it to the next level? You could start with something as simple as asking to put this topic on the next practice staff meeting agenda and having a team discussion regarding the potential value for transforming your practice's culture.

VETERINARY PRACTICE TEAM WELLBEING 15Final Thoughts Is the investment in your practice culture worth it? \"The decision that an owner or partner makes to commit to a formal culture transformation process can be one of the most important decisions they will ever make as a leader of the practice. The positive outcomes that result because of a healthy culture will be game changing, and the negative consequences of this unrealized opportunity can be profound and should not be underestimated.\" \u2014Ed Kanara, DVM, DABVP What are the benefits of a culture transformation in your practice? Decreased employee turnover Increased employee satisfaction and productivity Improved communication Improved individual wellbeing Improved practice reputation How can a practice team get started working on their culture? 1. Visit aaha.org/culture and take advantage of the exceptional tools and resources there. 2. Defi ne, as a group, the culture you want to have. For example, how do you want to deal with the stress at your practice? How do you want to communicate and solve problems at your practice? How do you want to support each other through the changes and challenges that you face? Until you've done that, there is no way to align the behaviors that are impulsive, so there's no compass associated with the culture. 3. Align the behaviors that are critical to the practice's success. For example, the team recognizes that the gossiping in the practice is causing problems, so everyone agrees that they won't tolerate or participate in it. Everybody doing simple things together can make a huge diff erence in your practice's culture.
