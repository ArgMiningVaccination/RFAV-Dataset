However, the quality of the evidence was low, limiting confidence in the results. This Study Summary was published on January 31, 2023. Background Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a debilitating mental and physical condition characterized by persistent [fatigue](/conditions/fatigue/) and other symptoms, such as [anxiety](/conditions/anxiety/) and [depression](/conditions/depression/). [[1]](/research-feed/study/1PV6W9/#ref-1) Because the causes of CFS are unclear, the treatment of it remains suboptimal. Chinese herbal medicine has been widely used to treat CFS in China, although clinical evidence has long been lacking. In recent years, evidence has been mounting that supports the beneficial effects of Chinese herbal medicine on CFS symptoms. This meta-analysis reviewed and analyzed the available evidence to investigate the efficacy and safety of Chinese herbal medicine for treating CFS. The study This systematic review and meta-analysis of 84 randomized controlled trials, which included 6,944 participants (mean ages of 32-55), examined the efficacy and safety of Chinese herbal medicine on CFS symptoms compared with placebo. The researchers identified 69 Chinese herbal formulas in different forms, including decoctions, granules, liquids, pills, capsules, ointments, and herbal porridge. The treatment duration ranged from 7 to 120 days. To judge the effectiveness, the researchers analyzed subjective and objective outcome indicators. Subjective outcomes included scores and scales that measure fatigue, anxiety, depression, mental state, and clinical symptoms. Objective outcomes included immune indicators, such as the blood levels of immunoglobulin A (IgA), immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin M (IgM), and natural killer cells. The primary outcomes were the changes in the 14-item Fatigue Scale (FS-14) and Fatigue Assessment Inventory (FAI) scores, two internationally recognized tools for measuring fatigue. The number of minor and severe adverse events was used to assess the safety of Chinese herbal medicine. To judge the quality of the evidence, the researchers evaluated the heterogeneity (differences in outcome between studies) and risk of bias in the included studies. The results Overall, Chinese herbal medicine improved many subjective and objective indicators of CFS. Regarding subjective outcome indicators, Chinese herbal medicine improved the primary outcomes of FS-14 and FAI scores as well as anxiety, depression, mental state, and clinical symptoms scores. Concerning objective outcomes, Chinese herbal medicine elevated levels of IgA, IgG, and IgM but not natural killer cells. As for safety, only 14 of the 84 studies reported minor adverse reactions, and no study reported severe adverse events. The quality of the evidence was judged as low, given that the heterogeneity and risk of bias of the included studies were substantial. Note The results of the meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution, given the low quality of available evidence. Although the results support the beneficial role of Chinese herbal medicine in treating CFS, the methodological flaws of the included studies limit confidence in the outcomes. Furthermore, all of the studies were conducted in China, which limits how much the results can be generalized to other populations.
