There is no denying crystals look beautiful, but did you know that adding them to your home has more benefits than pure aesthetics? Using crystals at home is a spiritual practice with a long history and can be used to both improve the energies of your home like [Feng Shui](https://www.homesandgardens.com/interior-design/what-is-feng-shui-meaning), and cleanse your home of existing negative energy, experts say. Here, spiritualists have explained how to use crystals at home, including the perfect crystal placement, and which crystals you should be selecting for your space. How to use crystals at home Ancient practices to refresh a home's energy range from [cleansing a house with sage](https://www.homesandgardens.com/life-design/how-to-cleanse-a-house-with-sage) to [using sound to cleanse your house](https://www.homesandgardens.com/life-design/sound-cleansing), but experts explain that the benefit of crystals is that different rocks offer different effects, giving you a greater degree of control. 'Crystals have been used for thousands of years dating as far back as the ancient Sumerians in Mesopotamia,' says [Kristen Blythe](https://rootedwisdomcoaching.com/about/ancestral-healing-practitioner/), spiritual coach and founder of Rooted Wisdom Holistic Life Coaching. 'Their use has been identified in cultures throughout the world such as Ancient Egypt and Ancient Greece. In the middle ages large books that explained the metaphysical properties and uses of each stone called lapidaries were used, the oldest of which can be traced back to Theophrastus, an ancient Greek philosopher,' Kristen says. Kristen Blythe's passion is empowering her clients as a personal ancestral lineage healer and certified CPD life coach and IACET wellness coach. Kristen is also a practiced meditation instructor. Using crystals became synonymous with [creating good Feng Shui](https://www.homesandgardens.com/interior-design/how-to-create-good-feng-shui-in-your-home) in ancient Chinese home decor, medicine, acupuncture, and talisman, says [Vickie Gould](https://www.lifechangingenergy.com/pages/about-us), energy and sound healer and founder of Life Changing Energy. 'Native American cultures often used crystals in rituals and ceremonies in the home. Now the New Age movement draws on a mix of various spiritual and metaphysical beliefs about the energy of crystals and how they can be used to promote healing, balance, and well-being.' Vickie Gould used to be a fine jewelry maker, but after her chronic illness lead her to step down she turned to herbalism and became a Law of Attraction Practitioner. Through these studies, she realized why she had been so attracted to certain gemstones when she used to make jewelry. She became increasingly interested in how our mind and spirit are connected to our physical body. The best crystals to use at home and where to place them There are hundreds of crystal types available that are thought to offer spiritual benefits, but, for beginners, there are nine that experts recommend starting with to make crystal placement easier. 1. Amethyst - for a range of cleanses [Maria Hayes](https://trusted-astrology.com/), astrology specialist and founder of Trusted Astrology believes that Amethyst is best placed 'in the kitchen for it has the power to detoxify food,' she says. 'If you want to maintain good health by getting rid of food toxins, always keep this crystal handy.' Amethyst is also said to be a good option to activate the [Feng Shui wealth corner](https://www.homesandgardens.com/interior-design/what-is-the-feng-shui-wealth-corner), relieving stress and irritability to allow you to focus on your goals and work towards achieving them. 'Amethyst can also help with dream recall, and an activated intuition, and can promote REM sleep when kept on a nightstand or near the bed,' adds holistic life coach, Kristen Blythe, helping you to relax and recharge. Amethyst Cluster | From [$11.66 at Etsy](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1623321&xcust=homesandgardens_gb_9698788218088655000&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F917423895%2Famethyst-cluster-free-gift-w-every&sref) Amethyst is a great starter crystal to use around your home for all sorts of cleansing purposes, making it ideal for beginners.

Black Tourmaline - to cleanse negative energy If you are looking to get rid of negative energy and bolster feelings of security without using piles of [salt to cleanse your home](https://www.homesandgardens.com/life-design/how-to-cleanse-your-home-with-salt), then black tourmaline is a great option, says Vickie Gould, energy healer. 'Placing a piece of black tourmaline near the front door or other entryways to your house can help create a protective barrier to prevent negative energy from entering. Similar to clear quartz, black tourmaline can also neutralize electromagnetic radiation from electronic devices.' 3. Jade - for spiritual healing We may not always prioritize [kitchen Feng Shui](https://www.homesandgardens.com/kitchens/kitchen-feng-shui), but it is an important space to keep in balance as the heart of the home, reminds astrologer Maria Hayes. To do this, you should consider jade for spiritual healing to keep this space calm and collected, she says. 'It is thought to have various spiritual healing properties to help balance bodily fluids,' she explains. 'When used inside the kitchen and placed on your counter, jade can also activate your heart chakra energy.' 4. Clear Quartz - To improve energy flows Clear objects are most commonly used in spiritualism to help promote the flow of energies through the environment and your body, so practices like [placing a glass of water under your bed](https://www.homesandgardens.com/life-design/why-you-should-put-a-glass-of-water-under-the-bed-at-night) or using clear quartz are good options if you are concerned about energy balances in your space. Known as the 'Master Healer,' clear quartz 'purifies and energizes the environment of any room. The best place to put it is in the center of your home, such as a kitchen or living room,' explains energy healer Vicky Gould. 'It will radiate outward and promote a positive environment throughout the house. 'Clear quartz is also believed to absorb and neutralize electromagnetic radiation so it's great to put around your electronics such as computers and TVs for [office Feng Shui](https://www.homesandgardens.com/interior-design/office-feng-shui) and for good [living room Feng Shui](https://www.homesandgardens.com/ideas/living-room-feng-shui),' she adds. 5. Selenite - a good starter crystal to improve energy If you are starting out on your energy journey, then selenite is a good crystal to go for improved energy flows - especially when paired with [good feng shui furniture placement](https://www.homesandgardens.com/interior-design/feng-shui-furniture-placement), says holistic life coach Kristen Blythe. 'Aesthetically, a selenite tower is a nice decorative piece. They come in many different sizes, they do not require care as they only emit energy and do not absorb, and they can be used in any location in the home safely and effectively.' Selenite Tower | [$7.50 at Etsy](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1623321&xcust=homesandgardens_gb_1249184541922994700&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F845744442%2F15cm-selenite-tower-selenite-rough-tower&sref) Selenite is another starter crystal for cleansing negative energy and is easy to incorporate into interior design with its tall, sculptural tower forms 6. Aventurine - to promote peace in workspaces If you are looking to improve your focus in your work life, then an Aventurine crystal could be a great addition to your [desk Feng Shui](https://www.homesandgardens.com/interior-design/desk-feng-shui), says astrologer Maria Hayes. 'The moment you place this on your desk you can feel the stone promoting peace, enhancing your mental powers, attracting money and good fortune. It is also recommended for career enhancement. So the next time you verbalize your career intentions on your crystal, it will help magnify all your manifestations.' 7. Shungite - for mitigating the negative energies around electronics Electronics are a tricky aspect of Feng Shui and good home energy. They are essential to modern life, but they constantly lower the energy of our homes. The solution? Using a shungite crystal, suggests astrologer Maria Hayes. 'This crystal is best placed near your charging outlets. It does an amazing job at purifying your space that is full of electromagnetic fields because the home and workplace are usually full of smartphones, gadgets, and various electrical devices bringing in such energies,' she explains. Consider placing them in [bedroom Feng Shui,](https://www.homesandgardens.com/interior-design/bedrooms/bedroom-feng-shui) in living rooms, and in offices. 8. Apophyllite - to increase good vibrations for meditation As more of us embrace [slow living at home](https://www.homesandgardens.com/interior-design/slow-living-homes) and practices such as mindfulness, gratitude, and meditation, adding crystals can help to enhance your practices, says Maria Hayes. 'Place this crystal in your living room area to bring in good vibrations for uplifting and energizing your lounging area,' she suggests. 'Mindfulness meditation is also best done with an apophyllite nearby since it can clear your thoughts and make them free from distractions and helps you focus during your ritual.' 9. Rose Quartz - for improving relationships Rose quartz is one of the prettiest crystals to add to your home and is believed to be excellent for bringing love, compassion, and harmony into the home, says holistic life coach Kristen Blythe. Better yet, it can be used in any room of the house. Rose Quartz XL chunk | From [$10.85 at Etsy](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1623321&xcust=homesandgardens_gb_1201434503698961700&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F887766081%2Frose-quartz-chunk-xl-rough-raw-crystal&sref) Although smaller options are available, a large chunk of rose quartz is perfect for making a statement and cleansing your home of negative energies, and promoting positive relationships in any space. FAQs How do I activate my crystals? Cleansing crystals are thought to need activation to help them cleanse your energy of pace. To do this, you can rejuvenate the crystal's energy by speaking your affirmations to it, holding the crystal in the warmth of your hand, and repeating your positive intentions and goals. This can help to refocus you on your tasks and provide positive energy. Where should I keep my crystals when I am not using them? When you are not actively using your crystals, experts recommend leaving them out on display in an area with lots of natural light so you can continue to admire their beauty or keep them safe in velvet pouches in a box to prevent accidental damage. Using crystals to cleanse certainly gives you more control over your home's energy, possibly helping you create a [mindful home](https://www.homesandgardens.com/news/mindful-home-tips-216273) for well-being, or even help you to [sleep better](https://www.homesandgardens.com/advice/how-to-sleep-better) with their positive auras.
