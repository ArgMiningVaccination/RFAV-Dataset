Strike: \"surgically\" Following: \"abnormalities\" Insert: \", except that a may apply tissue conditioning agents\" Discussion: REP. TUNBY stated that if the word \"surgically\" is removed, then it would change everything. REP. J. RICE stated that the intent was not to diagnose or treat any abnormality because it is current law. If \"surgically\" were struck, it would raise other problems. Vote: Motion carried unanimously. Motion: REP. KASTEN moved to amend HB 413. Page 5, lines 22 through 25. Following: line 21 Strike: subdivision (d) in its entirety Discussion: REP. MESSMORE asked what this amendment does. REP. KASTEN stated that the denturists would have to have some association with the dentists in order to do the things that are needed. REP. LEE stated that dentists agree that there are certain conditions that can exist in the mouth in fitting a partial. A denturist is not trained to diagnose difficulties or adjust a condition in the mouth to adequately treat the patient. This is not controlling what the denturists can and cannot do necessarily, but there is patient concern, which is a consumer issue. REP. HANSEN stated that if a patient refuses to see a dentist there isn't much someone can do. If the patient comes to a denturist to have a new set of teeth made, the liability is on HU02069l.HMl HOOSE HOMAN SERVICES & AGING COMMITTEE February 6, 1991 Page 3 of 12 the patient, not the denturist. If this is taken out of the bill, you are taking out a part of the bill. REP. BOHARSKI stated that REP. HANSEN is correct. This only deals with the partial. REP. CROMLEY stated that he supports the amendment. Putting this in the bill would put a lot of responsibility on the patient who may not see a dentist who signed a waiver saying it is all right to work on the denture. He has made a dental decision that most patients don't have. REP. MESSMORE stated concern that by deleting this, it would mean forcing a denturist to have a working relationship with the dentist. One consideration could be that the denturist would not be able to proceed in fitting a partial denture unless the patient had seen a dentist within 60 or 90 days. REP. LEE stated that they are making a policy decision on behalf of the patient. They need to protect the patient even from himself in this instance. On page 5, line c, the current law asks the denturist and dentist to cooperate. REP. KASTEN stated that they didn't want to set up a practice for the denturist. If anyone could waive their right and say, \"I trust you to do what I want you to do,\" we are allowing them to go out on their own without any connection with the professional person who should be directing such things. REP. HANSEN stated there is a different issue. If a patient goes to a denturist to have a new set of teeth made, and that denturist sees that there is something wrong having already gone through this procedure with the dentist, he is not going to do anything that he shouldn't do as defined in this bill. The problem is getting that patient in to see a dentist. Motion: REP. HANSEN made a substitute motion to amend HB 413. Page 5, line 23 Insert: , \"within 60 days\" Discussion: REP. SQUIRES stated concern about the liability issue. If this person makes a mistake, and if this is taken out, who is liable, the dentist, the patient or the denturist? If left in, whose liability is it? David Niss stated that this section is a mandatory requirement that applies only to the actions of the denturist prior to making and fitting the denture. Even if this language didn't exist, it would probably be the case that the denturist could preventing the patient from using the waiver. By removing this, we are not presented the denturist with that waiver. H0020691.HMl HOUSE HUMAN SERVICES & AGING COMMITTEE February 6, 1991 Page 4 of 12 REP. CROMLEY stated that dentures cannot be replaced without the patient seeing the dentist. REP. BOHARSKI stated if a person were to sign a waiver to his optometrist, then he can do a diagnosis even though he is not trained to do it. Vote: Substitute motion failed 2-18 with REPS. WHALEN and JOHNSON voting aye. Vote: Motion carried 17-3 with REPS. ROSSELL, HANSEN, and WHALEN voting no. Motion: REP. BOHARSKI moved to amend 9. Strike: \"or a\" also be made by a board-II Discussion: REP. ROSSELL stated that she would resist the amendment because the committee has made some changes. They are in a better position to determine continuing education and it should be left the way it is. Roland D. Pratt stated that the denturist association would not want to be the only ones that would recognize it. Vote: Motion carried 15-5 with REPS. ROSSELL, WHALEN, STICKNEY, Motion/Vote: REP. STICKNEY MOVED HB 413 DO PASS AS AMENDED. Motion carried unanimously. EXECUTIVE ACTION ON HB 299 Motion: REP. S. RICE MOVED HB 299 DO PASS. Motion: REP. S. RICE moved to amend HB 299.

TUNBY asked how this differs from current law. REP. S. RICE stated that present law states all the reasons that the court cannot terminate and it adds another reason the state has failed to complete a treatment plan. It gives the judge another option of terminating parental rights. REP. J. RICE asked if on the final amendment on page 2 is there a (.) after treatment plan. REP. S. RICE said no, the sentence keeps going. REP. J. RICE stated that the court may terminate parental rights. Under the new section it would be simpler to try to strike so there won't be two separate statutes in section 1 in the existing statute. REP. S. RICE asked if section (d) was included in subsection 1 and 2. vote: REP. S. RICE withdrew her motion. There was no action taken on HB 299. EXECUTIVE ACTION ON DB 246 Motion: REP. WHALEN MOVED DB 246 BE TABLED. Discussion: REP. WHALEN stated that he agrees with part of the concept of the legislation that mandates certain health insurance coverage. This bill sets out a sunrise mechanism which prevents a person from bringing a piece of legislation into the legislature similar to what we already have as far as licensure bills. He doesn't agree with the system that has been set up. Vote: Motion carried 15-5 with REPS. MESSMORE, TUNBY, SPRING, JOHNSON, and J. RICE voting no. EXECUTIVE ACTION ON DB 355 Motion: REP. CROMLEY MOVED DB 355 DO NOT PASS. Motion: REP. HANSEN MADE A SUBSTITUTE MOTION THAT DB 355 DO PASS. Motion: REP. S. RICE moved to amend HB 355 with amendments 1, 4, 5, 6 and 7. EXHIBIT 1 Discussion: REP. JOHNSON asked how they arrived at these figures. REP. S. RICE stated they deserve about a 50% increase based on inflation. HU020691.HMI HOUSE HUMAN SERVICES & AGING COMMITTEE February 6, 1991 Page 6 of 12 These benefits were set in 1983. We applied a 50% benefit, but left it at $7,000 because he estimates the Senate will cut at least another $1,000. REP. BOBARSKI asked what providers or insurance people think this type of inflational increase mandated benefits is going to do with this probable cost of health care to the 28% of the damage occurred to be limited and shared because of the mandated benefits. REP. S. RICE stated that they all share the opinions about mandated benefits. She has the same information as the committee in regards to what the mandated benefits under this would do to insurance cost. Vote: Motion carried 18-2 with REPS. KASTEN and LEE voting no. Motion: REP. S. RICE moved to amend HB 355. Page 4. Strike: lines 15 through 19. Discussion: REP. S. RICE stated that without this amendment, the bill would take things away from the insurance providers in terms of their abilities to have a utilization. REP. WHALEN asked what restrictions there are currently, as to who is to provide benefits under this mandated coverage. What is the effect of the language contained on the bottom of the amendments? David Niss stated that the effect of the language in the current subsection 3 on page 4, lines 15 through 19 would be to prohibit the insurer from limiting the care and treatment he was going to pay for as long as the care of treatment was prescribed by a health care professional licensed under Title 37. Motion/Vote: REP. WHALEN MOVED HB 355 BE TABLED. Motion carried 17-3, with REPS. DOWELL, HANSEN and RUSSELL voting no. HEARING ON SB 66 Presentation and Opening Statement by Sponsor: SEN. MIKE HALLIGAN, Senate District 29, Missoula, stated this is a licensure bill. This bill deals with a relatively new profession in Montana. The general public has moved away from the heavy use of drugs. Naturopaths deserve to be licensed they have a comparative curriculum. Looking at the qualifications and who goes to school the longest and in what areas, one will have to recognize the importance of the basic curriculum by the two main policy relations. This is a very important freedom of choice issue for people in the health care area. It doesn't tell people to go to a naturopath. The second portion of the bill says that licensing is also there to protect the public. The Senate was concerned about the scope of practice. Are these HU020691.HMl HOUSE HUMAN SERVICES & AGING COMMITTEE February 6, 1991 Page 7 of 12 people qualified to do the things they say they do? Naturopaths can do minor surgery that involves only incidental or superficial lacerations or abrasions. The naturopaths do not want to dispense legend drugs. Proponents' Testimony: Michael Bergkamp, Montana Association of Naturopathic Physicians, submitted written testimony. EXHIBITS 2, 3 & 4 Allen Lefohn, submitted written testimony. EXHIBITS 5 & 6 Dr. Nancy Dunn, Montana Association of Naturopathic Physicians, stated that she was an out-of-hospital birth attendant for twelve years, a registered nurse for ten years and for eight of those years she was a hospital staff nurse. She is a graduate of the National College of Naturopathic Medicine and holds a certificate of special competency in natural childbirth in the State of Oregon. She has a deep respect and appreciation for both branches of medical sciences. The mutual respect and ease of interaction between the complimentary sciences of medicine allow for the greatest benefit to the public. Dr. Mary Stranahan, General Practitioner in St. Ignatius, submitted written testimony. EXHIBIT 7 Printer Bowler stated that his father was brought into this world by a naturopathic physician. Health education is really important because it isn't just fix it when something goes wrong, it's how to stay healthy. Dave Ford, Chairman, Lewis and Clark Commission, stated that one consideration in the adopted naturopathic medicine in the health plan is that the administrative health plan assured them that it would save money and it has. Nancy Aagenes, Montana Association of Naturopathic Physicians, went on record in support. Todd Schlamper, Naturopathic Physician, went on record in support. P.J. Hennessy, M.D., self, submitted written testimony. EXHIBIT 8 Dr. Russell, M. Jaffe, M.D., self, submitted written testimony. EXHIBIT 9 Opponents' Testimony: Jerry Loendorf, Montana Medical Association stated that the issues are fundamental. The health care license applies to one that proposes service, frequent or whatever, to the public. The State of Montana has never told a person to go to a naturopathic HU02069l.HMl HOUSE HUMAN SERVICES & AGING COMMITTEE February 6, 1991 Page 8 of 12 physician and that it will work. The difference between going to a naturopathic physician as opposed to a licensed health care professional is that the Legislature has approved the licensed health care professional. Edward Bergin, Montana Medical Association, Montana/Wyoming Chapter, stated that the advances brought forth by the practice of medicine have been sometimes overwhelming. Naturopathic physicians have not been through the same curriculum as physicians of a school of medicine. This is not a turf battle, but he feels naturopathic physicians are not qualified to be treating people the way they do. Bonnie Tippy, Montana Chiropractic Association, went on record in opposition. Steve Browning, Montana Hospital Association, went on record in opposition. Cindy Lewis, Montana Dietetic Association, submitted written testimony. EXHIBIT 10 Dr. Garrett Dale, Department of Justice, state Medical Examiners, went on record in opposition. James Ahrens, President, Montana Hospital Association, submitted written testimony. EXHIBIT 11 Roger Tippy, Montana Pharmaceutical Association, went on record in opposition. EXHIBIT 12 R.D. Marks, M.D., self, submitted written testimony. EXHIBIT 13 Questions From Committee Members: REP. CROMLEY asked how would this bill protect the status of the naturopaths. Mr. Leondorf stated that he cannot say that it will. They will continue to practice as they are now. All the bill says is that the state approves. REP. CROMLEY asked if there has been any attempt by organizations to keep naturopaths from practicing. Mr. Leondorf stated none that he knows of. REP. LEE asked Mr. Dale what experience he has had with naturopaths. Mr. Dale stated that he was doing an autopsy on a patient and the family members asked him if the patient had cancer. He said that the patient didn't have cancer. The patient's family said that a naturopathic physician had been treating this patient for cancer. This naturopathic physician was misapplying a test and using it to monitor the patient for what the naturopathic physician had misdiagnosed for four years as her having cancer. HU020691.HMI HOUSE HUMAN SERVICES & AGING COMMITTEE February 6, 1991 Page 9 of 12 REP. BROWN asked what is the purpose of the amendments. Mr. Tippy stated that all legend drugs, in which the FDA requires dispensed upon the prescription of a physician or other provider such as veterinarian, not be within the scope of naturopathic practice of legend drug prescribing and dispensing. The dispensing of drugs is regulated in the courts under very restrictive guidelines. REP. BROWN asked for his response to the amendment presented. Mr. Bergkamp stated that the naturopathic physicians had developed language with the Pharmacy Board on this matter. They took out antibiotics. All that remains in this bill that one would call a legend drug is whole gland thyroid. Dr. Aagenas stated that naturopaths are practicing primary care medicine and they believe there must be minimum standards applied to what they do. They complete a minimum of four professional curriculums and minimum testing standards before calling themselves naturopathic doctors. They are not trying to restrict anyone's scope of practice, nor say that they want their scope of practice defined. REP. JOHNSON asked if they are qualified to be licensed under the current Montana law or could be licensed under another board if they so choose. Dr. Aagenas stated that she is licensed as an acupuncturist by the Board of Medical Examiners. Her training in oriental medicine and acupuncture is two to three years over and above her six years in naturopathic medicine. Her colleagues are not acupuncturists and do not have the medical scope of practice that she and Dr. Bergkamp do. REP. JOHNSON asked what will happen to the naturopathic physician that diagnosed the patient as having cancer for four years before she died. Dr. Dale stated that he contacted the Board of Medical Examiners. They said that naturopathic physicians are not licensed and there wasn't much they could do. REP. J. RICE asked about the provision dealing with childbirth, on page 5, subsection 8. It defines naturopathic childbirth dependents in minor form by the described antibiotics and emergency medicines of minor surgery. Dr. Bergkamp stated there are state laws that require of a prophylactic application of an antibiotic in certain diseases. Natural childbirth is a serious form of health care. REP. J. RICE asked if that included episiotomy. Dr. Bergkamp said no. REP. J. RICE referred to page 9, section 7, where it states that a naturopathic physician may not practice naturopathic childbirth until certified. Then it states the requirements are that a person must attend 50 childbirths and in 25 of them must be the primary birth attendant. Dr. Dunn stated they must have residency for nine months, supervised by licensed physicians and HU02069l.HMl HOUSE HUMAN SERVICES & AGING COMMITTEE February 6, 1991 Page 10 of 12 a team of practitioners. At the point when that person is being graded, he functions as the primary care provider, he is then identified and essentially can sign the birth certificate. REP. MESSMORE asked if naturopaths can immunize children. Dr. Aagenas stated that she does not immunize children, she refers them to a medical doctor. REP. TUNBY asked if she actively promotes immunization. Dr. Aagenas stated that they operate under the policy to inform the parent so the parent can make the decision. She actively provides information on immunization. REP. TUNBY asked if she refers patients to medical doctors. Dr. Aagenas stated that she couldn't practice without referring patients to medical doctors. REP. CROMLEY stated that there are two colleges offering degrees in Naturopathic Medicine, do other colleges in the country offer courses in Naturopathic Medicine. Dr. Bergkamp said there are only two colleges that have accreditation status by the Department of Education. REP. LEE asked what is included on the bottom of page 3, line 24, where operative methods for the surgical repair. Dr. Bergkamp stated that operative and electrical are considered the very instruments that we are talking about. A suturing needle would come under that qualification, one treatment that some Naturopaths do to control bleeding. They are very superficial. REP. JOHNSON asked if there were an allied health care board, would this group be willing to be licensed under that proposal. Dr. Aagenas stated they are willing to write coordination and instruction into this bill. REP. BOHARSKI asked what a legend drug is and if oxytocin was one. Dr. Dunn stated that a legend drug is one protected by law and yes, oxytocin is. REP. LEE asked what amount of class time was devoted to spinal manipulation. Dr. Bergkamp stated he had a minimum of 200 hours which did not include the clinical application. Dr. Dave Gray stated that 2,018 clinical hours are required. Between 600 to 800 hours of the 2000 is on chiropractic manipulative techniques. This varies from school to school. Closing by Sponsor: SEN. HALLIGAN stated that the Naturopaths need to be licensed, otherwise the public will not be protected. If he didn't feel there was a scientific foundation or that the education wasn't there he wouldn't be here. HEARING ON HB 429 HU020691.HMI HOUSE HUMAN SERVICES & AGING COMMITTEE February 6, 1991 Page 11 of 12 Presentation and Opening Statement by Sponsor: REP. BETTY LOU KASTEN, House District 28, Brockway, stated that this bill grants a medical parole for individuals who have an incapacitating illness or disease and who do not present a danger to society. They must have this certified by a doctor, while the examination or misdiagnosis and also a prognosis of what their recovery might be. This does not, in any way, diminish the Board of Pardons or remove any of the safeguards that the Board provides to society. Proponents' Testimony: Dan Russell, Administrator, Corrections Division, Department of Institutions, stated that this bill ~as requested by the Department of Institutions (DOl). Currently neither the Board of Pardons or DOl is capable of placing medically incapacitated or terminally ill inmates on parole who are no danger to society. They remain a financial burden on the state. These cases are rare but do occur. There is no option but to pay their bills with General Fund money. Medical paroles will enhance the inmate's eligibility for private insurance for Medicaid benefits and for care outside the prison. Opponents' Testimony: None Questions From Committee Members: REP. SQUIRES asked if this is another shift of dollars. Mr. Russell stated that some people have their own insurance. In other instances it is. Closing by Sponsor: REP. KASTEN stated that this is not one of the recommendations from the Criminal Justice and Corrections Committee. It was discussed, but was never put in the form of a recommendation. The state's correctional policy is that a person convicted of crime shall be dealt with in accordance with individual characteristics, circumstances, needs and potentiality. Seriously ill persons should have available speedient mechanisms that would enable them to apply for parole while completing their minimum sentence. Most prisons do not have the staff to care for these inmates. This is a good bill which allows a person dignity at a time when he most needs that. EXECUTIVE ACTION ON HB 429 Motion/Vote: REP. MESSMORE MOVED HB 429 DO PASS. Motion passed unanimously. HEARING ON HB 468 Presentation and Opening Statement by Sponsor: HU020691.HMI HOUSE HUMAN SERVICES & AGING COMMITTEE February 6, 1991 Page 12 of 12 REP. THOMAS LEE, House District 49, Big Fork, stated that this bill was requested by the Department of Social and Rehabilitative Services for two reasons. First to cleanup administration and accounting language, and secondly to standardize some of their accounting procedures. Because of recent developments in the subcommittee and the Governor's budget, SRS said they no longer need this bill. Proponents' Testimony: None Opponents' Testimony: None Questions From Committee Members: None Closing by Sponsor: REP. LEE closed on HB 468. EXECUTIVE 468 Motion/Vote: REP. STICKNEY HB 468 BE TABLED.

II 2 HB035501.ADN HYPERTENSION DIAGNOSTIC SUMMARY Typically asymptomatic patient with a repeatable blood pressure reading of greater than 150/90 mm Hg Patients with acute severe hypertension (diastolic >150 mm Hg) or with some\u00ad what lower pressures but with symptoms of headache, visual disturbance, somno\u00ad lence, or other \"crisis\" symptoms must be hospitalized and treated on an emergen\u00ad cy basis with parenteral hypotensive drugs. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS , According to standard medical thought, hy\u00ad pc'rtension is divided into two categories: pn\u00ad mary or essential hypertension and secondary hypertension. As evidenced in Table 1, 92-94% of a 11 diagnosed hypertension is termed essen\u00ad tial, i.e., the underlying mechanism is un\u00ad .known. It is believed that a combination of genetic and environmental factors is responsi\u00ad ble for the condition (Couldn't this be-stated for all conditions?). Although behavior pat\u00ad terns and stress play an important part, hyper\u00ad tension is closely related to dietary factors. Table 1. Causes of Hypertension ======================================= 0.3 <0.1 <0.1 2-. 0.2 Hypertension is another of the many diseas\u00ad es or syndromes associated with the Western di\u00ad et, and is found almost entirely in developed countries. People living in remote areas of China, the Solomon Islands, New Guinea, Pana\u00ad ma, Brazil, and Africa show virtually no evi\u00ad dence of essential hypertension, nor do they experience a rise in blood pressure with ad\u00ad vancing age.1,2 Furthermore, when racially identical members of these societies migrate to .1.c,sS remot~ a.reas and adopt a mO.re \"~i~ili~e\" dIet hypertensIOn Incre s Cirim:i tica II y.1,2 6/3:05 Copyright (c) 1985 Piuorno &. Murray The prevalence of hypertension (BP > 160/95 mm HG) in the U.S. is estimated at 20% in the adult white population and 30% in black adults. These values arc nearly doubled if the reading of 140/90 mm Hg is considered the up\u00ad per limit of normal. Since hypertension is associated with an in\u00ad crease in cardiovascular morbidity and mortal\u00ad ity, monitoring blood pressure offers an inval\u00ad uable noninvasive diagnostic and prognostic aid. Table 2 indicates some factors associated with an adverse prognosis in hypertension. Al\u00ad though clinicians are primarily concerned with diastolic pressure, systolic pressure is also an important factor. Males with a normal diastolic pressure \u00ab82 mm Hg) but elevated systolic pressure (>158 mm Hg) have a 2! fold in\u00ad crease in their cardiovascular mortality rates when' compared .with to normotensives with normal systolic pressures \u00ab130 mm Hg). Table 2. Factors Indicating an ~dverse Prog\u00ad nosis Black racial background Youth Impaired renal function Nervous ayatem: Cerebrovaacular accident THERAPEUTIC CONSIDERATIONS Many dietary factors have been shown to correlate with blood pressure: sodium to potas\u00ad sium ratio, percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids, fiber and magnesium content, and levels of simple carbohydrates, total fats, and choles\u00ad tcrol. r Diet J* Sodium and Potassium: The role of a high sod\u00ad ium-low potassium intake in the pathogenesis HYPERTENSION VI:HyprTn-l of essential hypertension has been considered extensively and conclusively.l.2.39 Excessive c;onsumption of dietary sodium chloride, cou\u00ad pled with diminished dietary potassium, induc\u00ad es an increase in extracellular fluid volume and an impairment of blood pressure regula\u00ad ting mechanisms. This results in hypertension in susceptible individuals. Evolution has provided powerful mechan\u00ad isms for conserving sodium and eliminating po-. tassium, but there is no corresponding efficient mechanism for conserving potassium or elimin\u00ad ating excess sodium. Of the many feed-back loops regulating blood pressure, at least four are influenced beneficially by sodium restric\u00ad tion and high potassium intake: (1) the renin\u00ad angiotensin system, (2) the aldosterone system, (3) the sympathetic nervous system, and (4) the baro-receptor reflex.9 A high potassium-low sodium diet reduces the rise in blood pressure during mental stress, reduces the pressor effect of exogenous nora\u00ad drenalin, and reduces the extracellular fluid volume, thus allowing the normal feedback mechanisms to function more effectively.9 So\u00ad dium restriction alone does not improve bar\u00ad oreceptor function, it must be accompanied by a high potassium intake.9 This combined ap\u00ad proach also improves patient compliance, since it includes many foods that do not warrant salting. (See appendix A:Sodium Potassium Content of Foods for a list of foods with a fa vora ble sodium to potassium ratio). In general, hypertensives consume higher levels of salt than normotensives. This results in an elevated salt taste threshold (a positive feedback cycle) which returns to normal after long-term sodium restriction.3 As public con\u00ad sciousness of the harmful effects of excess sod\u00ad ium has risen, consumer purchases of table salt have decreased.l Unfortunately, the salt con\u00ad tent of processed and prepared foods has also risen.l It is therefore important to properly ed\u00ad ucate the patient about the \"hidden salt\" in prepared food and condiments. Substituting potassium chloride for sodium chloride may have therapeutic effects. How\u00ad ever, many of the \"salt substitutes\" still contain up to 50% sodium chloride; and there is ex peri\u00ad men ta I evidence suggesting that chloride con\u00ad sumed concomitantly with sodium is the in salt sensitive individuals' hyper\u00ad tensive response.H When compared with non\u00ad vegetarians, vegetarians generally have lower blood pressure levels and a lower incidence of VI:HyprTn-2 HYPERTENSION hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases. Dietary levels of sodium do not differ signifi\u00ad cantly between these two groups. However, a typical vegetarian's diet contains more potassi\u00ad um,' complex carbohydrates, polyunsaturated fat, calcium, magnesium, vitamin C, and vitamin A.\u00b7o Fantus Test: This simple office procedure is useful for estimating daily dietary intake of sodium chloride, and can be used to monitor patients' efforts to control salt intake. See Chapter II:Fantus Test for a full discussion of its a ppl ica tion. Fiber: The lack of dietary fiber, as mentioned in other chapters, is a common underlying fac\u00ad tor in many diseases of \"Western civilization\". The high-fiber diet has been shown to be ef\u00ad fective in preventing many forms of cardiovas\u00ad cular disease. As even mild hypertension is as\u00ad sociated with an increased risk of cardiovas\u00ad cular disease, the therapeutic regime outlined for the prevention of atherosclerosis is indi- cated in treating hypertension. . Essential Fatty Acids: Increasing dietary linole\u00ad ic acid has a profound hypotensive action in man.78 This is due to normalization of the E series prostaglandins which are known to be decreased in hypertensive patients.78 This sim\u00ad ple dietary effect is prevented by aspirin and other cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, implying that use of these types of agents is contraindicated in hypertensive individuals.8 Sucrose: Sucrose elevates blood pressure. Mech\u00ad anisms which have been proposed to explain this include: (1) increased sodium retention, (2) increased aldosterone secretion, (3) elevated in\u00ad sulin levels, and (4) increased catecholamine secretion.13 The most plausible of these appears to involve increased catecholamine production resulting in increased sympathetic tone and in- creased sodium retention. . Calcium and Magnesium: Epidemiological data reveals that hypertensives consume less daily calcium than normotensives and may benefit from calcium supplementation.l1 Calcium sup\u00ad plementation also reduces blood pressure in young normotensives.10 In a double blind study, 1,000 mg/d has been shown to lower blood pressure by 7 mm Hg in hypertensives.\u00b7s This appears to be somewhat of a contradic-tion, since it is well known that calcium chan\u00ad ncl blockers decrease intracellular calcium lev\u00ad cis and are hypotensive agents. However, in vi\u00ad Iro studies indicate that calcium itself is a spe\u00ad cific i\"nhibitor of calcium channels.iS It is pos\u00ad sible that this effect occurs in viVo as well. Magnesium may be a more important factor in lowering blood pressure. It is well known that magnesium sulphate is effective in the trcatment of eclampsia and that, as a divalent cation, it competes with and antagonizes calci\u00ad um. as \"Nature's physi-. OIOglC calcium channel blocker.\"42 It\u00b7 was first recommended as a therapy for malignant hypertensIOn as early as 1925.43 An lOtracellular deficiency of free magnes\u00ad ium is a major etiological factor in hyperten\u00ad sion, as its levels are consistently low in hyper\u00ad tensives as compared with normotensives, and they show an inverse correlation with blood pressure.~3 In one double-blind clinical study, magnesium supplementation lowered blood pressure by 12/8 mm Hg in 19 of 20 subjects in the experimental group, compared to 0/4 in the placebo group.~\u00b7 Ascorbic Acid: There is an inverse relationship between serum vitamin C levels and blood pressure in hypertensive men.\u00b7l Whether this is due to better dietary habits or a hypotensive effcct of vitamin C has yet to be determined. Lifestyle and Environmental Factors Caffeine: The effects of long-term caffeine consumption on blood pressure have not yet been unequivocally determined.31 Short-term studies consistently show elevation in blood pressure in both normotensive and hypertens\u00ad ive individuals which usually normalize after a few days. One large study (6,321 adults) de\u00ad monstrated a small but statistically significant elevation in blood pressure (2.5/0.6) when com\u00ad paring those who drank five or more cups a. day to non-coffee drinkers.\u00b79 Alcohol: Even moderate amounts of alcohol produce acute hypertension in some paticnts \\' ia increased ca techolamine secretion.37,.7 Chronic ingestion is one of the strongest pre\u00ad dictors (sodium consumption being the other) of blood pressure.S7,S8 Smoking: That cigarette smoking is a cQntrib\u00ad uling factor to hypertension is well known. It 6/3/85 Copyright (el 11)85 Pizzorno & Murray -'.'\" 1- .-. ~-UL-qc.l -~ 19<.o ----- is not as well known that smokeless tobacco, i.e., snuff, chewing tobacco, and plug, also in\u00ad duces h~f.ertension via its nicotine and sodium content. ,~8 Smoking is also positively associ\u00ad ated with increased sugar, alcohol and caffeine consumption.ss The prcssor response to nicotine is due to its adrcnal stimulation, which results in increased catecholamine secretion.s~ Fur\u00ad thermore, cigarette smokers are known to have highcr concentrations of lead and cadmium and lower concentrations of ascorbic acid than nonsmokers.S5 Weight and Hypertension: Epidemiological and clinical studies have repeatedly demonstrated that obesity is a major factor in hyperten\u00ad sion.18 Possible mechanisms include: (1) eleva\u00ad ted cardiac output, (2) increased body sodium due to hyperinsulinemia or abnormal aldoster\u00ad one/renin relationships, and (3) neuroendocrine \u00b7abnormalities due to increased noradrenergic activity or opiate suppression. Weight reduction reduces blood pressure in normotensive, hypo\u00ad tensive and hypertensive individuals. Weight reduction should be a priinary therapeutic goal for decreasing hypertension in obese patients, and may contribute to the management of moderately overweight hypertensives. Heavy Metals: Chronic exposure to lead from environmental sources, including drinking wa\u00ad ter, is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. Elevated blood lead levels have been found in a significant number of male hyper\u00ad tensives.12,46 Areas with a soft water supply have an increased plumbosolvency due to the acidity of the water, and people living in these areas may be predisposed to hypertension. It should be noted that soft water is also, of course, low in calcium and magnesium.12 Cadmium has also been shown to induce hy\u00ad pertension, with untreated hypertensives show\u00ad ing blood cadmium levels three to four times those in matched normotensives.16 Zinc has been shown to effectively reverse cadmium in\u00ad duced experimental hypertension in rats.17 Zinc may also be indicated as a supplement in essential hypertension due to its inhibition of calcium activated calmodulin22. Stress Reduction such as biofeedback, tran\u00ad scendental meditation, yoga, progressive muscle relaxation, and hypnosis have been shown to have some value in lowering blood pressure.20 HYPERTENSION YI:HyprTn-3 Exercise: Exercise is strongly indicated since it reduces both stress and blood pressure.31 The exercise program should, of course, be careful\u00ad ly designed, taking into consideration the pa\u00ad tient's needs and cardiovascular condition. Botanical Medicines An extensive review article by PetkQv22 is the major source of the following information concerning the hypotensive and coronary-dilat\u00ad ing effect of medicinal plants which have been used historically as anti-hypertensive agents. He studied 80 plants belonging to 31 families used in various types of extracts (a total of 235 different extracts were investigated). Con\u00ad siderable attention was given to isolating the, main active constituent of each herb, but as Petkov states, \"The healing effect is produced not only by one or another of its components, but by the whole complex of biologically ac\u00ad tive substances contained in the plant.\" Follow\u00ad ing is a brief discussion of some major anti-hy\u00ad pertensive botanicals and an abbreviated list of other herbs with confirmed hypotensive ac\u00ad tion. Interested readers are encouraged to study Petkov's admirable review. Allium Sativa: Garlic has been used by all peo\u00ad ples of the world as a valuable medicinal agent for a wide variety of illnesses. Although most recent research has focused on its hypolipidem-. ff 23 IC e ects, garltc has been shown to have hy- potensive qualities.22,H In humans, garlic has been shown to decrease the systolic pressure by 20-30 mm Hg and the diastolic by 10-20 mm Hg.22 Other members of the allium family have hypotensive effects, with aged extracts of Alli\u00ad um un'inum being the most potent.22 The phar\"1aceutical mechanism of garlic's hypo\u00ad tensive Album: toxin, viscerin, viscol, oleanolic and ursolic acid, choline, tyramine, and quebrachine, to but a few). The hy\u00ad potensive action of misletoe is due primarily to its inhibitory action on the vasomotor center in the medulla oblongata, although it does possess cholinomimetic activity.22 Olea leaves contain exerts a complex phar- VI:HyprTn-4 HYPERTENSION macological action (both central and periph\u00ad eral) to reduce hypertension, dilate coronary vessels, and act is a useful agent in relieving neurotic states and producing sedation and therefore IS useful in stress induced hypertension.22 ous are the active consti\u00ad tuents; and the flavonoid product, Crataemon, has been used as a cardiovascular agent in Eu\u00ad rope for many years. Its healing properties are attributed to: (I) improvement of coronary blood supply by dilation of the coronary ves\u00ad sels, (2) improvement of metabolic processes within the myocardium resulting in improve\u00ad ment in functional heart activity, and (3) elim\u00ad ination of some forms of rhythm disturbanc\u00ad es.22 Hawthorne preparations are considered ideal phytotherapeutic preparations due to their absence of harmful side effects.22 Various dihydropyranocoumarins and dihy\u00ad drofuranocoumarins isolated from Umbellifer\u00ad ous plants are known to exhibit spasmolitic and coronary vasodilatory activity.2/) Species a coronary dila\u00ad tory effec~ analogous to Crataemon and a much greater tensive drug de\u00ad rived from plants.22 Vinca Minor: Periwinkle belongs family Apocynaceae, has coronary dilatory and hypo\u00ad tensive action. Central ganglion blocking and peripheral vascular mechanisms underlie its hypotensive action.22 Rauwolfia Serpentina: Although used primarily as a universal sedative, Rauwolfia has been the source of over 20 alkaloids with a wide spec\u00ad trum of pharmacologic al\u00ad kaloid, reserpine, depletes catecholamine and serotonin stores in many organs, including the brain, heart, blood vessels, and adrenal med ul\u00ad lao Within one hour after ingestion, catechola\u00ad mines are decreased, with maximal depletion at 24 hours. Alkaloids are not the only hypoten\u00ad si ve consti t uen ts in Rauwolfia since alkaloid\u00ad free extracts exhibit hypotensive action. The use of the whole' plant is advocated as a possi\u00ad ble protective measure against known reserpine. side effects (primarily depression). The use of Rauwolfia is indicated only in severe hyperten\u00ad sion and should not be used in patients with a history of depression.22 Veratrum Viride: Hellebore, like Rauwolfia, should only be used in extreme cases. The mode of action of v.eratrum alkaloids is via va\u00ad gal stimulation, resulting in a narrow thera\u00ad peutic range. It is difficult to use, with side effects including respiratory depression, nau\u00ad sea, and vomiting.22 Other lelraplera.27 Miscellaneous Factors allergies have been shown to cause hy~ pertension.II) Hypothyroidism is often a cause of second\u00ad ary hypertension and is easili controlled with thyroid replacement therapy.2 An atrial protein has been shown to be a potent renal vasodilator.28 The consumption of bovine atrial extract or a meal of bovine atria may allow for absorption of segments of this peptide with biological activity. Bovine renal extract has also been shown to possess antipressor effects, i.e., it appears to diminish renin's pressor effect in animals and hypertensive human subjects.36 6/3/85 CopyrighL (e) 1985 Pizzorno & Murray THERAPEUTIC APPROACH Effective control of this complex and multi\u00ad factorial disease requires careful evaluation and management of the hypertensive patient. Although a \"cookbook\" approach can bc taken, determination of each patient's specific causes and needs greatly improves the quality of care. The first step is to establish that the pa\u00ad tient's hypertension is, in fact, essential and not secondary to one of the diseases listed in Table I. Next, determine (as illustrated in the diagnostic differentiation flowchart below). if any factor known to be associated with hyper\u00ad tension is present in the patient. Third, assist the patient in changing his/her diet and life\u00ad style to one which is more conducive to good cardiovascular health. And finally, if neces\u00ad sary, a botanical agent may be used to tempor\u00ad arily reduce the patient'S blood pressure while the more long-term therapies take effect. Therapeutic Differentiation: Hair analysia-(high Pb or Cd)-> find & eliminate lee Obese )-> weight reduction \" aee IV:Food Allergy Diet: The diet should be formulated to ensure that a normal weight is established and maintained. Sugar \u00ab50g/d) and salt intake \u00ab2g/d) should be restricted, while the con\u00ad sumption of foods rich in potassium (>7gjd) (sec Appendix A:Sodium and Potassium Con\u00ad tent of Foods), (>Ig/d), magnesium (lg/d), and fiber (lOg/d) should be encour\u00ad aged. In addition, a low-total fat (with mod\u00ad erate levels of linoleic acid), vegetarian, or vegetarian-like diet can be recommended. Garlic and other members of the onion fam\u00ad ily should be freely consumed.

February 6, 1991 Members of House Committee on Human Services and Aging House Hearing; SB66 Naturopathic License I am here today to testify in support of licensing the Naturopathic physicians. My name is Allen Lefohn and I live in the Helena area. I am an active research scientist with a doctorate in chemistry. I have included a copy of my Resume. I am a scientist who specializes in theoretical research that focuses on the effects of acidic precipitation, ozone, and global change on the ecosystem. I have published approximately 70 peer-reviewed scientific articles and more than 80 technical reports. My research is published in journals around the world. I am presently an executive editor of the internationally acclaimed scientific journal, Atmospheric Environment. As a scientist, I have been trained to carefully evaluate data and draw conclusions concerning cause and effect relationships. Science involves more than the implementation of complex laboratory experiments. Science involves an orderly method to solve problems, in which a recognized problem is subjected to thorough investigation, and the resulting facts and observations are analyzed, formulated into a hypothesis, and subjected to verification by means of experiments and further observations. 1 A key ingredient used in the scientific approach is observation. Observation provides us with the identification of a recognized problem. Observation serves as the focus for our creating the questions for which we seek rational answers. In many cases, scientific learning is advanced through the collection of what may appear to be unrelated observations. It is this collection of observations that provides a scientist with specific patterns of information that, in many cases, help explain cause and effect relationships. Once identified, these patterns of information can be used by the scientist to develop several working hypotheses that can be further tested. Recognizing that science is the search for truth and is the knowledge of facts and laws arranged in an orderly system, I have been trained to continuously challenge the thoughts and ideas that are commonly accepted in my field of research. One of the major talents that a scientist must have is the ability to have an open mind, critically observe facts, and draw rational conclusions. I would like to take the time today to share with you some of my observations. For the past 3 1/2 years, my wife has experienced Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, a disabling disease whose symptoms are similar to Mononucleosis, but which lasts from several years to a lifetime. During the early stages of her disease, she sought help from several medical professionals. It was readily apparent that conventional medical help did not exist, either for alleviating the symptoms of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome or helping the patient recover from the illness. 2 ... -----~\u00ad ;).-ls...-31 ~, ' --\", j '-.. _- . Fortunately, naturopathic medicine was available. Over those 3 l/~ears, I have Sf> ~4 seen my wife travel through the many stages associated with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. With the help of Dr. Michael Bergkamp, a local naturopathic doctor, each new symptom or group of symptoms has been treated effectively. More importantly, herbal and homeopathic medicine, nutritional approaches, and acupuncture have all helped strengthen her own immune system, allowing her to recover. With my scientific curiosity piqued, I have read articles and books that describe the underlying principles associated with naturopathic medicine and believe those principles to be well founded. Many of the naturopathic principles are based on encouraging the body to help itself. For example, herbal remedies are used to stimulate various chemical processes in our bodies that protect us from disease. The Chinese, who started using herbs as medicines about 5,000 years ago, still successfully use herbal remedies in modern hospitals. Among the oldest herbal remedies are ginseng, ginkgo leaves, and garlic. Nearly 50% of all prescriptions issued by conventional physicians today contain one or more key drugs that are either directly derived from natural sources (Le., herbs) or synthesized from natural models. Major drug manufacturers spend billions of dollars each year on drugs derived from plants. Digitalis, a drug used to treat congestive heart failure, comes from the foxglove plant. It is my belief that many of the sophisticated medical approaches used by naturopaths complement and supplement the sophisticated surgical methods used by 3 western physicians. It is the meeting of the medical philosophies of the East and West, for the benefit of you and me, that will provide each of us with the choice of how best to allow our bodies to be healed from the many common and not-so-common ailments from which we may suffer. As a scientist, besides having the opportunity to observe the effects of my wife's treatments for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, I have observed similarly successful effects on myself during times when I have been a patient of Dr. Bergkamp. Approximately 16 months ago I found myself in the intensive care unit of St. Peter's hospital, suffering from an irregular heartbeat. Following several days of tests that yielded negative results, I was told to lose weight, work a little less than the average 18 hours a day, and exercise. Having left the hospital with the above recommendations, cardiac medication, and the results of my extensive medical tests, I chose to combine conventional and naturopathic medicine as I planned strategy for healing. I have explored ideas and approaches with Dr. Bergkamp for providing my body with t :le proper supplements and nutrients to support my running and biking activities and to optimize my overall health. Utilizing the suggestions he has made, I have remained off all cardiac medication, with my internist's approval, the past year and am healthier than I have been in 20 years. I am thankful that naturopathic doctors were available to assist my wife and me. Naturopathic medicine complements the more conventional medical approaches that are presently used around the world. It is important that naturopathic doctors be provided 4 with the legislative tools to regulate themselves so that proper standards and practices can be achieved through peer review. I urge you to provide licensing to the naturopathic physicians so that their profession is regulated in a manner similar to any other medical profession. Allen S. Lefohn, Ph.D. P.O.

EL: p10I \" Testimony for SB 66 House Human Services and Aging Committee 6 February 1991 p~.henness~m.d. 243 NORTH AVE. EAST MISSOULA, MT 59801 (406) 721-8849 I am a family physician with special training in public health. During my 15 years in primary care I have observed that the medications and therapy prescribed by allopathic doctors such as myself sometimes have significant untoward effects for some patients. These sid~ effects require that the treatment be discontinued. Naturopathy uses homeopathic remedies. For some this is the only resort. The presence of this option serves to improve the health of those unable to use more customary regimens or medicine. My impression after reading SB66 is that this piece of legislation will rigorously oversee and rejulate the quality and performance of those seeking to practice naturopathy. I believe it is Cl strong protedion for Montanans who choose this path of health care. I urge you to support it. q EXHIBIT-.-:---- DATE 2-(0 -<3' I S;h u.~ , Testimony MD, PhD, FCAP (CP/CC), FASCP, FACN, FAIAIS on behalf of Senate Bill 66, 52nd Montana Legislature Madame Otairman and Senators of the Committee: It is my privilege to testify before you as a physician on behalf of this bill to license maturopathic doctors. First I would like to present my professional background and then support passage of this legislation as vital to the interests of Montana citizens. Background on Dr. Jaffe: My medical schooling includes an MD (with honors) and a PhD (in Biochemistry and Medical Science) from Boston University Medical Center (BUMC) in 1972. After an Internship in Medicine done at University Hospital in Boston (BUMC's academic teaching hospital) I was awarded a United States Public Health Service Commission and was assigned to the Clinical Center of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) where a Residency in Clinical Pathology lead to Board certification in laboratory medicine in 1975 and to subspeciality board certification in Chemical Pathology in 1977. From 1975-1979 I was a permanent Senior Staff Physician at NIH. During my tenure at NIH my group developed novel laboratory procedures including a high specificity early colon cancer screening test; specialized tests of blood clotting that help link changes in stress with the stickiness of blood platelets with risk of heart disease; research on the reversibility of coronary artery disease and athreosclerosis; a test to detect blood loss from the intestine; methods for preservation of blood platelets; and fundamental research on the mechanism by which structural proteins (collagen) activate blood platelets. For this work The J. D. Lane (USPHS) Annual Research Award, the Merck, Sharpe, and Dohme Excellence in Research Award, Nlli Meritorious Service Awards have been awarded. My publications include over 40 peer reviewed articles and a roughly equal number of invited papers, abstracts, symposia addresses and books. Since leaving government service I have worked for a healthier America as Fellow of the Health Studies Collegium and through private sector initiatives including projects or reports to The Governor's Office of the State of California; The Board of Agriculture of the State of Hawaii; and The Health Insurance Association of America. Since 1987 I have been Medical Director of Serammune Physicians Laboratory, provider of a state-of-the-art blood test of immune reactions of blood cells. Since 1989 I have also been Director of the Princeton BioCenter, a 20 year old foundation sponsored research institute. I am an elected Fellow of several medical professional societies including the American Society of Clinical Pathologist (ASCP), the American College of Nutrition (ACN), and the American In Vitro Allergy Immunology Society (AIAIS). My qualification for being here is simply that I provide continuing education lectures to over 5,000 medical and naturopathic doctors through invited lectures to professional societies and graduate schools. While I am sure that many of the people who appear before you are distinguished and represent large constituencies, I provide myself and my family's experience as the basis for my remarks. Reasons why Dr. Jaffe testifies on behalf of this bill: 1. Montana citizens deserve freedom of choice 2. Naturopathic doctors are competently, scientifically, and clinically well trained 3.

Naturopathic medicine is being used and unregulated environments invite problems 7. There is a need for professional peer review Addressing each of these points in tum ... 1. Montana citizens deserve freedom of choice As American citizens, your constituents deserve to have the freedom to choose among safe and effective forms of health care. This is a basic, constitutional right which is as important in health care as in any aspect of life. People with health needs should have the choice of their health care provider -as they currently do among allopathic (conventional), osteopathic, chiropractic, and podiatric doctors. 2. Naturopathic physicians are competently, scientifically, and clinically well trained One of the key questions about this bill is the safety and efficacy of naturopathic medicine. While more study always needs be done (or so we scientists almost alwyas say), there is enough scientific literature to satisfy me that the answer to this question of safety and efficacy' is that naturopathic practice is as safe and effective1.2, within it's scope of practice, as allopathic medical practice, podiatric practice, osteopathic practice, optometric practice, and chiropractic practice. Studies have shown that naturopathic doctors spend more time per patient visit and that patient outcomes are at least comparable between naturopathic and other doctors, within proper scopes of practice. One measure of the safety and efficacy issue is the low cost of malpractice insurance for naturopathic doctors compared with medical doctors. For example, a naturopathic doctor pays about $2,000 which is less than one third of the $7,000 premium that a General medical doctor pays in malpractice fees (HIAA, AANP, and W ANP, personal communications). In addition, in a four year study by Master Insurance Trust the incidence of naturopathic doctors having malpractice claims made against them was lower than for comparable medical doctors. In my lectures before naturopathic students I find no difference in level of ability or enthusiasm from that of medical students. If anything, naturopathic students seem 1.

AANP Quarterly Newsletter. 1989; 5: 32-35. more highly motivated and clear in their intent to serve people than medical students. In my continuing education lectures, the attentiveness of the audience and the quality of questions asked is comparable between naturopathic and medical doctors. In my collaborative research in biochemistry, immunology, and toxicology, I find no difference in depth of knowledge of the scientific literature between naturopathic and medical scientists. Further the curricula for training of naturopathic and other medical doctors are quite similar. The following chart compares naturopathic and allopathic practice.

As someone who ought to know better, I respectfully submit that those who oppose this bill on that supposed grounds, are unaware of the facts. In conclusion naturopathic medicine is as scientifically grounded and well documented as other medical disciplines. 3. This bill can help contain costs of medical care We are all painfully aware the costs of medical care continue to rise in spite of heroic efforts to contain them. At the same time peoples confidence in medical professionals is at an all time low? As my grandmother used to say, liThe rents are going up and the ceilings are coming down./I By following Surgeon General's Richmond8 and KOOp9 and also Secretary of Health and Human Services Sullivan'slo recommendation to employ preventive health approaches; to seek and treat the cause not the consequence of a health problem; to apply low risk / high gain approaches first, naturopathic and other prevention-oriented physicians have been shown to be cost effective in their provision of carell. A large part of this derives from naturopathic doctors use of less expensive diagnostic technologies to achieve comparable, equivalent results. 4. Competition in the physicians market is healthy It is my experience that competition is healthy, useful, and timely. 5. People look to you Senators for protection 7.

You have been selected by your fellow citizens to represent their interests. In my conversations with airport personnel, hotel employees, and legislative staff it is clear that citizens want competent professionals to regulate their professions behavior. People also want the choice available from amongst various professional choices for their care. This is what I hear from Glacier National Park to Bozman; from Billings to Kalispell; from Helena to Arlie. 6. Naturopathic medicine is being used and unregulated environments invite problems This brings me to a companion point: naturopathic doctors are practicing in this state. They are currently unregulated. There are people who present themselves as naturopaths without proper training. I call upon you to protect people from harm by enacting this legislation. 7. There is a need for professional peer review I urge you to include proper standards and practices as well as proper peer review in the legislation in order to provide choice to caring, cost effect competent care to yourselves and your fellow citizens.

RE: Senate Bill 66 Naturopathic Health Care Practice Act Dear Health Catmittee\u00b7 Me.lTbers: I am a family practitioner, having been 'licensed to practice in the state of Washington since 1979. During the last 10 years of my practice, I have been involved in integrating traditional medical care with a roore naturally oriented practice. As a result, I have had numerous opportunities of interacting with naturopathic physicians, and this experience has been most favorable. I would strongly support licensure for naturq>athic physicians, as I believe this provides iii distinct advantages for physicians and' patients in the state of Montana. I have developed a profound respect for roost of the naturopaths with whom I have had contact. Their education at this point time is appropriate and adequate for the situations that they deal with. I have found them to be clinically effective in a number of practice situations which have not responded well to medication or surgery, fran a traditional medical standpoint. Finally, the integrity of roost of the naturopathic physicians whan i have encoWltered has been beyond reprooch. I have found my interactions with naturq>athic Plysicians to be an enhancement to my practice, and an expansion of patient choice. As a result, I feel canplimented by naturq;>aths, rather than threatened by them. I understand that many M.D. 's in M:>ntana have not had an o~rtunity to ~rk directly with naturopathic physicians, and as a result, may feel unccmfortable in providing licensure for nattlrq)aths. I would offer my 10 years positive experience working with naturopaths as a reassurance ,in this regard. I ~uld also suggest that licensure is the best way to provide quality assurance, to make sure that inedical care, both traditional and naturopathic, is of the highest possible caliber. . 'lherefore, I strongly support the licensure of naturopathic physicians in the state of Mootana. If I can provide further details, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thank you Madam Chair and members of the Committee. I would be happy to ans\\'l/erany questions you may have later. I ~I-I' MONTANA James F. Ahrens, President Montana Hospital Association before the House Human Sernces & Aging Committee February 6, 1991 Thank you for this opportunity to testify. The Montana Hospital AsSOCiation, on behalf of its 58 member hospitals, is opposed to SB 66. We do so for one reason. MHA believes the Montana Legislature should not authorize the licensing of health professions unless there is irrefutable evidence of the efficacy of the profession to be licensed. No such independent peer review study that would document the claims of naturopaths that their treatment is successful has been provided to the Legislature during consideration of this bill. Hospitals are also concerned that even though this bill does not grant naturopaths hospital privileges, it would open the door for them to do so in the future. For example, the section on the Practice of Naturopathic Health Care - -Section 4, item 3 --would authOrize naturopaths to order certain diagnostic tests. Hospitals are concerned about this provision, because it could be interpreted to invite requests for ordering these tests from their facilities. Furthermore the bill would permit naturopaths to conduct what is called \"minor surgery.\" In our view, this definition establishes a precedent that would make it easier for naturopaths to broaden their scope of service in the future to a level that would be unsafe. And, that could potentially put Montana's hospitals at risk. The bill also would permit naturopaths to perform \"childbirth attendance,\" under certain circumstances outside the hospital. But the bill does not address the issue of liability for the hospital if an emergency arises during such treatment and emergency room treatment is reqUired. Finally, the bill would grant naturopaths pharmacy privileges for prescribing, dispensing and administering drugs, as specified by the Board. Again, there is a question about whether naturopaths' training is suffiCient to enable them to perform safely the full range of pharmaceutical services inferred by this language. Amended to Senate Bill 66 (third reading -blue) proposed by Montana State Pharmaceutical Association Section 4, page 6, line 4 following: \"50-31-301\" strike: \"except those natural therapeutic substances and drugs authorized by subsection (2) or [section 10 (2)]\" Section 4, page 6, line 19 following: \"therapies\" insert: \", provided Center #2 2831 Fort Missoula Road o<g --LL- February 4, 1991 .~ lo(.o To the Members of the House Human Services Committee: I am writing this letter in opposition to Senate Bill 66 which proposes to license naturopathic physicians. First of all, let me make it very clear that I do not oppose this legislation based on the fact that naturopaths represent competition. Fortunately, naturopaths are few in number. and most of the public are not gullible enough to believe in their far\u00ad fetched therapi es that they of fer, and there f ere, it is not a competitive threat at all. It is, however, a threat to the public health, and I oppose it on that basis. Medical doctors and osteopathic doctors all go through four years of credited medical school. That means that they participate in a program that is certified by a national certifying agency. The naturopaths themselves cannot decide what training or education is adequate and, therefore, have no standardized educational or training requirements. Furthermore, licensed physicians, after receiving the medical or osteopathic degree, go on to post-graduate training through internships and residencies. This requires three to seven years of further training. All of us in the profession of medicine realize that after four years of classroom and limited clinical experience, we are not close to being ready to apply what we have learned to the actual practice of medicine. Naturopaths have no requirements for any kind of post-graduate training where ~neir abilities to actually practice and observe are evaluated. It is a requirement for physicians to get licensed to show that they have had this training! and this should be a basic tenant of any kind of licensing act. The Naturopath Licensing Act as is outlined in Senate Bill 66 basically gives naturopaths the license to practice just as any allopathic physician in this state can practice. If this legislation is passes by the legislature, it will show that the legislature is irresponsibly deviating from its own guidelines regarding requirements for the practice of medicine. I would ask that you review the requirements that are necessary to be licensed as a physician in this state before you consider this legislation and then give it a do not pass recommendation. Furthermore, the National Council on Consumer Fraud in Healthcare has as one of its primary goals exposing the fraudulent practices Z-'f-.-. l..:s d--lc _cli '55 (P Co 2 offered by naturopaths. Much of what they do is completely untested in any scientific way, and looking at some of the things they treat and their methods of treatment makes me concerned from a medical, scientific viewpoint. Many of the medications for which they seek approval for prescribing are highly potent, potentially toxic chemicals that require more than an idea of the proper dosing regimen to properly prescribe them. Furthermore, naturopaths will disgense these from their offices since they don't have pharmaceutical prescriptive privileges. It is unethical for an allopathic physician to 9rescribe medications from his own offices because of the fear of unnecessari 1 y prescribing. This legislation opens the door for naturopaths to actually encourage them to do this. Finally, it has been said by some legislators that since the naturopaths are al ready practicing medicine and are going to practice no matter what we do, that we should legalize it. I think that logic is quite flawed because if we follow that type of logic. we should legalize all legal drugs, not worry about drunken drivers, and not worry about licensing any other profession in the state because no matter what laws we pass, some people are going to ignore these laws. In summary, I think that there are several reasons this legislation is seriously flawed, and I would encourage your rejection of this legislation. Sincerely, R.D. Marks, M.D. .. ..
