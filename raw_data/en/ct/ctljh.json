The 2018 Cholesterol Guideline is a full revision of the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults. The following resource contains tables and figures from the 2018 Guideline for the Management of Blood Cholesterol.

In younger individuals, healthy lifestyle can reduce development of risk factors and is the foundation of ASCVD risk reduction. In young adults 20 to 39 years of age, an assessment of lifetime risk facilitates the clinician-patient risk discussion (see # 6) and emphasizes intensive lifestyle efforts. In all age groups, lifestyle therapy is the primary intervention for metabolic syndrome. 1 In all individuals, emphasize heart-healthy lifestyle across the life-course. The more LDL-C is reduced on statin therapy, the greater will be subsequent risk reduction. Use a maximally tolerated statin to lower LDL-C levels by 50%. 2In patients with ASCVD, reduce lipoprotein high-intensity statin therapy or maximally tolerated statin therapy Very high-risk includes a history of multiple major ASCVD events or 1 major ASCVD event and multiple high-risk conditions. In very high-risk ASCVD patients, it is reasonable to add ezetimibe to maximally tolerated statin therapy when the LDL-C level remains 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L). In patients at very high risk whose LDL-C level remains 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) on maximally tolerated statin and ezetimibe therapy, adding a PCSK9 inhibitor is rea - sonable, although the long-term safety (>3 years) is uncertain and cost effectiveness is low at mid-2018 list prices.3In very high-risk ASCVD, use a LDL-C threshold of 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) to consider addition of nonstatins to statin therapy. If the LDL-C level remains 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L), adding ezetimibe is reasonable. If the LDL-C level on statin plus ezetimibe remains 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L) and the patient has multiple factors that increase subsequent risk of ASCVD events, a PCSK9 inhibitor may be considered, although the long-term safety (>3 years) is uncertain and economic value is uncertain at mid-2018 list prices.4In patients with severe primary hypercholesterolemia \"Top Ten Messages\" is continued in the next page.GUIDELINES MADE SIMPLE 2018 Guideline on the Management of Blood CholesterolChol5Back to Table of Contents In patients with diabetes mellitus at higher risk, especially those with multiple risk factors or those 50 to 75 years of age, it is reasonable to use a high-intensity statin to reduce the LDL-C level by 50%. 5In patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes mellitus and LDL-C 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L), start moderate-intensity statin therapy without calculating 10-year ASCVD risk. Risk discussion should include a review of major risk factors (e.g., cigarette smoking, elevated blood pressure, LDL-C, hemoglobin A1C [if indicated], and calculated 10-year risk of ASCVD); the presence of risk-enhancing factors (see # 8); the potential benefits of lifestyle and statin therapies; the potential for adverse effects and drug-drug interactions; consideration of costs of statin therapy; and patient preferences and values in shared decision-making. 6In adults 40 to 75 years of age evaluated for primary ASCVD prevention, have a clinician-patient risk discussion before starting statin therapy. . Risk-enhancing factors favor statin therapy (see # 8). If risk status is uncertain, consider using coronary artery calcium (CAC) to improve specificity (see # 9). If statins are indicated, reduce LDL-C levels by 30%, and if 10- year risk is 20%, reduce LDL-C levels by 50%. 7In adults 40 to 75 years of age without diabetes mellitus and with LDL-C levels 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L), at 10-year ASCVD risk of 7.5%, start a moderate-intensity statin if a discussion of treatment options favors statin therapy. \"Top Ten Messages\" is continued in the next page.Top 10 Take-Home Messages to Reduce Risk of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) through Cholesterol Management (2 of 3)GUIDELINES MADE SIMPLE 2018 Guideline on the Management of Blood CholesterolChol6Back to Table of Contents If CAC is zero, treatment with statin therapy may be withheld or delayed, except in cigarette smokers, those with diabetes mellitus, and those with a strong family history of premature ASCVD. A CAC score of 1 to 99 favors statin therapy, especially in those 55 years of age. For any patient, if the CAC score is 100 Agatston units or 75th per - centile, statin therapy is indicated unless otherwise deferred by the outcome of clinician-patient risk discussion. 9In adults 40 to 75 years of age without diabetes mellitus and with LDL-C levels 70 mg/dL- 189 ASCVD 7.5% to 19.9%, if a decision about statin therapy is uncertain, consider measuring CAC. Define responses to lifestyle and statin therapy by percentage reductions in LDL-C levels compared with base - line. In ASCVD patients at very high-risk, triggers for adding nonstatin drug therapy are defined by threshold LDL-C levels 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) on maximal statin therapy (see # 3).10Assess adherence and percentage response to LDL-C-lowering medications and lifestyle changes with repeat lipid measurement 4 to 12 weeks after statin initiation or dose adjustment, repeat - ed every 3 to 12 months as needed. Risk-enhancing factors include family history of premature ASCVD; persistently elevated LDL-C levels 160 mg/dL (4.1 mmol/L); metabolic syndrome; chronic kidney history of preeclampsia or premature menopause (age <40 years); chronic inflammatory disorders (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, or chronic HIV); high-risk ethnic groups (e.g., South Asian); persistent elevations of triglycerides 175 mg/dL (1.97 mmol/L); and, if measured in selected individuals, mg/dL, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (a) 50 mg/dL or 125 nmol/L, especially at higher values of lipopro - tein (a). Risk-enhancing factors may favor statin therapy in patients at 10-year risk of 5-7.5% (borderline risk).8In adults 40 to 75 years of age without diabetes mellitus and 10-year risk of 7.5% to 19.9% (intermediate risk), risk-enhanc - ing factors favor initiation of statin therapy (see # 7).

Percent LDL-C reductions with the primary statin medications used in clinical practice (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin) were estimated using the median reduction in LDL-C from the VOYAGER database (13). Reductions in LDL-C for other statin medications (fluvastatin, lovastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin) were identified according to FDA-approved product labeling in adults with hyperlipidemia, primary hypercholesterolemia, and mixed dyslipidemia. Boldface type indicates specific statins and doses that were evaluated in RCTs, and the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists'2010 meta-analysis. All these RCTs demonstrated a reduction in major cardiovascular events.
