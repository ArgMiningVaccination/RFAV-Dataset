She provides diet, exercise and lifestyle advice, as appropriate within the context of the acupuncture session. Acupuncture is becoming increasingly recognized as a great method of preventative care and a complement to Allopathic (Western) medicine. Frances often has doctors refer patients to acupuncture for headaches, pain, sports injuries, stress or anxiety and digestive disorders as well as other complaints. She also enjoys working alongside Physical Therapists, Massage Therapists and Chiropractors to ensure her patients progress as fast as possible in recovery. Because acupuncture has its roots in traditional East Asian medicine, it can provide a unique way of looking at stubborn conditions that may not have responded well to other therapies in the past. By treating holistically, the body, mind and emotions are all cared for. "}
