Latest research is reviewed year -round by working groups Research on specific vaccines includes: Safety, immunogenicity, effectiveness of a vaccine at a given age Severity of disease being prevented Number of children affected if no vaccine exists The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP): Questions and AnswersHow is the timing of vaccines determined? Research on timing of administration primarily focuses on morbidity and mortality at different ages ACIP studies the ages at which disease rates peak Balances risks of disease exposure to vaccine safety and effectiveness Goal is to vaccinate as early and safely as is beneficial The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP): Questions and AnswersIs it safe to give so many vaccines at once?! YES. Giving multiple vaccines at a single visit Improves coverage rates and individual protection More convenient/cost -effective for patient Does not change safety or efficacy of vaccines CDC Pinkbook p. 27Exceptions to multi -vaccine administration In general, any vaccine can be co -administered with any other vaccine except... AVOID co -administering the following: PCV-13 and Menactra Especially in asplenic patients Combo MMRV vaccine (age <4 y or first dose) Ok to give MMR and VZV at the same time but separately http://www.immunize.org/askexperts/experts_meningococcal_acwy.asp CDC Pinkbook p. 12Adverse EventsAdverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) What is an AEFI? \"An untoward effect caused by a vaccine that is extraneous to the vaccine's primary purpose of producing immunity\" aka Side Effect Three primary types Localized Systemic Allergic CDC Pinkbook p. 15Localized Reactions Most common type (up to 80% of vaccine doses) Examples: pain, swelling, redness at injection site, etc Occurs within hours of vaccine administration Usually mild, self -limited Rarely more severe \u2014Arthus reaction CDC Pinkbook pp. 15 -16Systemic Reactions Generalized, relatively mild symptoms Examples: fever, myalgias, headache, etc Non -specific symptoms; not always related to vaccine itself Somewhat more common with live -vaccines Virus needs to replicate Occurs days to weeks after vaccination CDC Pinkbook p. 16Allergic Reactions Rare, require medical attention Occur within minutes to hours of receiving vaccine Examples: diffuse urticaria, wheezing, anaphylaxis, etc Reaction may be to any vaccine component: antigen, preservative, cell culture medium, etc Risk can be reduced with pre -vaccine screening CDC Pinkbook pp. 16 -18AEFI and Causality AEFI can fit into multiple other categories besides extent of effects Severity, frequency, disease, age Vaccine -induced, programmatic, idiosyncratic, coincidental Difficult to assess causality More likely if: occurs on repeat administration, observed in prior studies, timing plausible,* biologically plausible *Note: timing does NOT necessarily indicate causality CDC Pinkbook pp. 49 -50The Provider's Responsibility Product Management (storage, handling, administration) Patient Care Screening for precautions and contraindications Timing and spacing of vaccines Managing AEFI Reporting AEFI to Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System Communicating risks/benefits to patients CDC Pinkbook p. 55National Vaccine Safety RegulationsVaccine Safety & Monitoring National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) (1986) Spurred by increase in lawsuits against manufacturers Mandated providers, manufacturers to report adverse events after vaccination Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) (1990) Administered by the CDC and FDA May be confirmed adverse reactions or coincidental events Receives 30,000 reports/year (41% providers, 29% manufacturers, 14% patients/parents) CDC Pinkbook pp. 51 -52Vaccine Adverse Effects Monitoring System VAERS is able to detect New or rare adverse events Increase in rates of AEFIs Patient risk factors for AEFIs Further studies needed to clarify adverse event signals Not all reported adverse events are causal effects CDC Pinkbook pp. 52Vaccine Adverse Effects Monitoring System Providers are required to report some adverse events following specific vaccinations to VAERS Encouraged to report any clinically significant event after vaccination if unsure about causality Manufacturers required to submit any adverse effects of which they become aware CDC Pinkbook pp. 52Vaccine Information Statements Vaccine information statements (VIS) must be given to patients prior to vaccination Mandated by National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act Available from CDC website, multiple languages Can use as a starting point in addressing patient concerns or screening for contraindications CDC Pinkbook pp. 59VAERS Reportable Events Following Vaccination Table of mandated reportable events available online

condition that might increase the risk or severity of an AEFI or compromise vaccine's effectiveness Avoid administering unless benefits >> risks CDC Pinkbook p. 57Screening for Contraindications/Precautions May be temporary or permanent Temporary: Moderate -severe illness, pregnant, etc Permanent: Prior history of anaphylaxis after receiving vaccine, Guillain -Barre, etc Screening is important tool in reducing risk of AEFI Immunization Action Coalition has standardized screening forms for children and adults CDC Pinkbook p. 30General Contraindications All vaccines Allergy p. 17General All vaccines Moderate to illness Acutely febrile Live-attenuated vaccines (MMR, VZV, other clear cause HPV Pregnancy Live vaccines Immunosuppression, pregnancy CDC Pinkbook pp. 17Specific Precautions Guillain -Barr\u00e9 Syndrome influenza DTaP Inconsolable crying, seizure, limp/pale episode, high fevers within 48 h of administration without other known cause CDC Pinkbook pp. 28 -29NOT a Contraindication to Vaccination Mild illness Mild self -limited localized reaction to previous dose Living with immunocompromised or pregnant person Potential exposure to infectious disease Current antibiotic use Breastfeeding Premature birth CDC Pinkbook p. 24Special ConsiderationsTiming/Spacing Between Doses Vaccines can be given up to 4 days before minimum interval to be counted as valid per ACIP recommendations Rules may vary by organization Interval between doses Typically about 4 weeks Increasing interval does not reduce effectiveness Decreasing interval may interfere with antibody response to previous dose Source: CDC Pink book, pp. 9 -14Egg Allergy General rule: If patient can eat eggs and egg -containing products without difficulty, they can get egg -prepared vaccines (flu, yellow fever, MMR) MMR ok to give with egg allergies If patient has history of anaphylaxis with egg products, avoid or \"refer for further evaluation\" CDC Pinkbook pp. 18Pregnancy ACOG Committee Opinion 741 No evidence of adverse fetal effects from inactivated vaccines Growing evidence of safety of vaccination in pregnancy DO NOT administer Live vaccines (MMR, VZV, intranasal flu, typhoid) avoid pregnancy for 4 weeks following administration HPV (not enough data yet) ACOG Committee Opinion 741, June 2018 CDC Pinkbook pp. 17 -19Pregnancy Can give >1 vaccine at a time Tdap Safe to give anytime Preferably administer weeks 27 -36 for highest chance of intrapartum transfer of passive immunity Close family and caregivers should be vaccinated within 2 weeks of anticipated due date (\"cocooning\") CDC Pinkbook pp. 17 -19Thimerosal Mercury -based antimicrobial additive used in many vaccines NOT the same as toxic mercury found in fish Has been safely used in vaccines since the 1930s No longer used in childhood vaccines Exception: multi -dose flu given to adults and kids Does NOT cause toxicity or autism https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/faqs.htmlDo Vaccines Cause Autism? NO. Neither do any known additives or adjuvants (e.g. thimerosal) MULTIPLE peer -reviewed studies have shown that there is NO link between autism and any vaccine, including MMR See CDC website and PubMed for full papers Studies include comparisons of vaccinated to unvaccinated children and those with autism compared to those without https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/autism.htmlGreat Resources on Vaccines CDC's Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine Preventable Diseases, 13thedition Available for free online at cdc.gov Immunization Action Coalition Great provider and parent resources including vaccine screening sheets free at immunize.org The History of Vaccines Interactive educational tool for providers, parents, kids at historyofvaccines.org Naro , Maki.
