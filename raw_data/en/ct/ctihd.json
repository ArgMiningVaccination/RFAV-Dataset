The idea of a vaccine passport \u2014 i.e. some form of verified proof of one's COVID-19 vaccination \u2014 has been the [subject of much speculation](https://www.businessinsider.com/vaccine-passports-coronavirus-how-will-they-work-in-us-israel-2021-4). With places like sports arenas, airports, and [even some employers](https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-google-netflix-tech-companies-require-vaccines-employees-office-return-2021-7) requiring such proof, the availability of apps and resources dedicated to housing vaccine card information is on the rise. Though the US government doesn't plan on implementing a federal vaccine passport system, other governments and numerous private companies have already introduced these vaccine \"passport\" apps as a secure, contactless option. These apps typically require identifying personal information, like biometric data and/or a government ID, to verify users' health information and prevent forgeries, and use security measures like encryption and blockchain technology to protect users' health data. The important thing to know is that you probably won't have much choice in the app(s) you use. Different airlines, arenas, workplaces, and other public and private authorities are likely to require users to use a specific app their venue is set up to accept. So, don't be surprised if your upcoming travel and entertainment plans end up requiring you to use a few different apps \u2014 which are far easier than having to [carry around your physical vaccine card](https://www.insider.com/guides/health/how-to-protect-your-covid-19-vaccine-card) wherever you go. The state of New York was among the first to have a bonafide program in place when it launched the [Excelsior Pass](https://epass.ny.gov/home), an [IBM-powered](https://www.ibm.com/products/digital-health-pass) smartphone app that allows users to display verified proof of vaccination or negative test results. The [app debuted](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-pilot-program-testing-excelsior-pass-madison-square-garden-and) at Madison Square Garden and the Barclays Center, and since the state offers the app for free to both individuals and businesses, it's become an accepted form of vaccination proof at many more venues. Other authorities, however, may require different apps as digital proof of vaccination. Here are some of the apps, available and currently in development, you might need to know. Vaccine passport apps currently available [Clear Health Pass](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/clear-fast-touchless-access/id1436333504) While New York is still the only state to launch a comprehensive app-based program, the [state of Hawaii](https://www.futuretravelexperience.com/2021/02/hawaii-to-pilot-clears-digital-health-passport-technology/) has been testing its own called the Clear Health Pass. Travelers on certain Delta and United nonstop flights from Los Angeles to Honolulu can show their negative test results, and [soon](https://affiliate.insider.com/?amazonTrackingID=biauto-10961-20&h=75fa901c974c0dac0c28fa4ff0f34deef6a00f98cf9e142e5fc743e5eec6571d&postID=61b8efdbf2a36b1ac9f493b6&postSlug=guides%2Fhealth%2Fbest-vaccine-passport-apps&site=in&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.clearme.com%2Fvaccine-validation&platform=browser&sc=false&disabled=false), proof of vaccination, with the Clear app to skip Hawaii's mandatory 10-day quarantine. The Clear app has also been [picked up for use](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/arenas-refilling-nba-installs-clear-health-pass-tech-for-covid-screening) by the NBA, MGM Resorts, the 9/11 Memorial & Museum, and more. Several NBA arenas already made it a requirement to demonstrate a clean bill of health via the app in order to gain entry. [CommonPass](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/commonpass/id1548682047) Created by The Commons Project and the World Economic Forum, the CommonPass app is specifically designed for travel. Users can connect their test results and vaccination records to the app, which will compare them against individual countries' COVID-related entry requirements. If you're a frequent international traveler, the CommonPass may come in handy: it's being [rolled out](https://www.webmd.com/vaccines/covid-19-vaccine/news/20210114/apps-to-let-travelers-others_show_covid_19_status) for use by JetBlue, United, Lufthansa, Swiss International Airlines, and Virgin Atlantic. [VeriFLY](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/verifly-fast-digital-identity/id1522957424) The identity verification app, VeriFLY, allows users to upload and verify health information like COVID test results. American Airlines, as well British and Iberia, are using VeriFLY as their app of choice for flyers to prove their travel-safe health status on certain limited flights. [Clear](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/clear-fast-touchless-access/id1436333504) Although Clear is known mainly as the service that allows members to jump the security line at major airports in cities like Los Angeles or New York City, its app also now has a convenient (and completely free) new feature called Health Pass. With Health Pass, users can store digital versions of their vaccine card for easy access when traveling, attending sporting events, or visiting any businesses that require proof of a COVID-19 vaccine. The app is available on both [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/clear-fast-touchless-access/id1436333504) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.clearme.clearapp&hl=en_US&gl=US). Vaccine passport apps in development IATA Travel Pass The International Air Travel Association announced that it's working on releasing a [Travel Pass app](https://www.iata.org/en/programs/passenger/travel-pass/) for airline passengers to prove their test results and vaccine information. The IATA plans to meet the digital health verification standards soon to be put forth by the World Health Organization, which should help airports accommodate travelers from different countries with different health paperwork. Currently, the Travel Pass is being trialed with several airlines, including Virgin Atlantic, Korean Air, Singapore Airlines, and Qantas. Other resources and contact tracing information [VaxYes](https://www.gogetvax.com/vaxyes) From the makers of GoGetVax, a COVID vaccine-scheduling online program, comes VaxYes. Unlike the Excelsior Pass and travel apps listed above, VaxYes does not determine your eligibility to enter certain countries or venues; it's essentially just a digitized version of your CDC card. This provides an alternative to carrying around your actual paper certificate that's more secure and more easily verified than, for instance, a simple phone photo of the original card. [VaccTrack](https://www.vacctrack.com/en) This app, available for iOS, Android, and web use, is another option for storing your health information and vaccine status and presenting it when necessary. All health information is verified by your medical provider and transmitted and stored on a secure and private cloud platform. The app even lets you document any vaccine side effects you might have. In addition to COVID-19 vaccination status, VaccTrack also manages COVID test results, as well as any other FDA-approved test or vaccine, so it could be useful for other travel, educational, or workplace purposes going forward. Contact Tracing Apps Apple and Google partnered [last spring](https://affiliate.insider.com/?amazonTrackingID=biauto-10961-20&h=2ad69ca65e49ced071b4d91553c711bd6abcad206c733e15465836a2d1c517b5&postID=61b8efdbf2a36b1ac9f493b6&postSlug=guides%2Fhealth%2Fbest-vaccine-passport-apps&site=in&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2020%2F04%2Fapple-and-google-partner-on-covid-19-contact-tracing-technology%2F&platform=browser&sc=false&disabled=false) to implement a contact tracing feature that works via Bluetooth to (anonymously) determine if your phone has been near the phone of someone with a known COVID-19 infection. [Several states](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/12/14/1014426/covid-california-contact-tracing-app-america-states/) launched their own contact-tracing apps using this technology. Refer to your state's public health authority to find out if your state has a contact tracing app and if so, how to participate. [V-safe After Vaccination Health Checker](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafe.html) The latest public health program to hit the internet is the CDC's [V-safe](https://vsafe.cdc.gov/en/), which asks users to report their symptoms and experiences following a complete vaccination against COVID-19. The interface can be accessed through the internet on any smartphone.
