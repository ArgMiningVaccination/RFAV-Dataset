If you start seeing a pattern, please let chief residents and/or Kirsten Day know. Formatted: Centered 27 During clinic session, here are your primary responsibilities There is a more detailed description of each task in subsequent pages Before leaving clinic session 1. You cannot leave until all residents have finished seeing patients and all patients have left the clinic 2. Address all messages in your in basket as well as in the in baskets of your attending group if relevant and ensure the provider pool items are complete 3. Check in with nursing staff that there are no outstanding patient care issues If there are active issues (patients sick or further evaluation needed) beyond 12pm If you must leave, you should make contact with another attending to see if they can come and relieve you. If none of them can, let Alanna know and she can try to find someone to cover. If you have to cover over the lunch hour and you also are precepting in the afternoon, let Alanna know and she can help find coverage so that you can get lunch. If a patient's work- up was started and requires continued evaluation in the afternoon, please make sure that the resident signs out the patient to the afternoon drop -in resident. You should also sign out the patient to the afternoon 81 attending and ensure that there is someone in the clinic (e.g., nursing staff) who stays with the patient during the lunch hour. The morning RN should also sign out the patient to the afternoon 81 RN. Precept : Residents with appropriate Epic documentation . Serve as consultant: For any NP, PA, RN, or MEA needs and document in Epic appropriately. For RN and MEA who have requests from walk -in patients about forms, refills, and other clinical issues. Manage clinic flow : By working with clinician of the day (COD) o Place same -day walk in patients into no -show slots for residents to meet target numbers per clinic session. Decision of movi ng patients need to go through COD. o At times, be called upon to see patients. Work with COD, triage RN to make sure same -day patients are triaged and seen in a timely manner . Support patient care : Help check provider pool in basket: refill prescriptions, manage urgent lab/imaging results, respond to urgent patient advice request messages, and manage patient call (TE) requests Help check resident in baskets Complete your administrative portion of pa tient care : Respond to and address all patient- relevant e-mails Clear down your in basket and the in basket of your attending group If relevant 28 If there are active issues (patients sick or further evaluation needed) beyond 5pm ) Drop -in patients who continue to need care after 5:00 should be sent to the ED. Try to make a decision re: ED transfer EARLY. FHC provider must give sign out to ED triage RN by calling 206- 9417 Appropriate patient transport must be arranged based on patient's stability Urgent labs or x -ray results that are pending should be signed out by the resident to that evening's first line backup resident (found under Amion ucsffcm) If patients need direct admission to SFGH See also direct admission tipsheet on Learning Dashboard in Epic. If patients need to be transferred to ED for higher level of care and evaluation Ensure that whoever (could be attending, resident, RN) knows the patient's clinical issue the most is signing out the triage ED RN at 206- 9417 Attending must consult with nursing staff to arrange for appropriate transportation, either escorted by FHC staff (if deemed safe and app ropriate) or via ambulance (if it's unsafe for escort OR there is no escort available to transport patients) If you have any urgent clinical or non- clinical questions or issues that you do not feel comfortable with, please contact: o Medical Directors: if related to clinic protocols, patient, or staff safety o Chief Residents or Residency Program Director (Diana Coffa): if related to resident issues o Nurse Manager or Charge Nurse: if related to RN/MEA staffing, nursing, or MEA protocols o Hospital Eligibility Worker Supervisor/Patient Access Supervisor: if related to eligibility worker questions or concerns o BHT Supervisor: if related to behavioral health team issues or concerns o Health worker Supervisor: if related to Health Worker issues or concer ns o Other great resources related to SFGH issues o AOD (administrator on duty) - page operator (dial \"0\") o Specialty clinic consults - page operator and ask for specific specialty clinic/team on call 29 Evaluations of learners For all learners You should give real -time reinforcing and constructive feedback on a regular basis . Always review the learner's visit notes as part of their feedback. For residents Since we have consistent clinic days for residents, you will likely be able to complete evaluations based on a longitudinal teaching relationship. Evaluations are scheduled and completed in MedHub . At the end of your teaching period with a resident, you will receive an email informing you that a new evaluation request has been added to your MedHub evaluations queue. In order to complete the evaluation, you must log into MedH ub (https://ucsf.medhub.com ) using your UCSF MyAccess ID and password. Alternatively, you may access your evaluations through the MedHub Mobile App, which is free for iPhone users in the App Store. Within MedHub, you should go to the Evaluations Tab -> Incomplete Evaluations to view all the evaluations you are scheduled to complete. Scheduled evaluations should also appear in your Urgent Tasks panel on your MedHub homepage. If you would like to submit an unscheduled e valuation of a resident, you may do so by logging into MedHub and going to the Evaluations Tab - > Initiate Performance Evaluation of a Resident . Please select the most appropriate form for the rotation or activity . Please remember that faculty evaluations of residents are not anonymous . If you encounter any difficulties accessing or using MedHub or have questions regarding evaluations, please contact the residency's Data and Evaluation Coordinator, TBD. If you have concerns about individual residents, you can contact Diana Coffa, Lydia Leung, Randy Jackson, or the chief residents at any time. 30 Precepting Residents Before you precept Find out the level of your learner so that you can set appropriate expectations and tailor your questions/clinical pearls accordingly. o R1: Aim for 10 minute precepting (at the beginning, this will take longer) , 5-10 minutes in exam room closing out visit. o R2: Aim for 5 minute precepting (remind the new learners about R2 model of presenting) . Allow resident to close out the visit as much as possible. o R3: Mostly serving as a consultant, do not need to see patient unless resident is unlicensed or requests for you to be in room with patient for an evaluation. If you are meeting the resident for the first time , check in to see if they have specific learning goals for the clinic session. For example, they might be working on managing clinic flow, completing notes in the exam room, or presenting more succinct oral presentations. Always try to balance clinic flow with length of teaching. Precepting documentation guidelines For unlicensed residents: o Pull in the 'Face -to-Face Attending Resident Attestation ' using the .attestation smart phrase into your own note. o Your note is the note of record, and it must reflect a face -to-face encounter wi th the patient . o Residents who precept with you should ALWAYS assign their locked note to you for co -sign. For licensed residents who consult with you (aka micro -precepting) o Pull in the ' Not face -to-face Attending Resident Attestation' using the .attestation smart phrase into your own note. You can date stamp your note or s ummarize the visit with a one -liner to ensure that there is some documentation of micro -precepting. For precepting residents on Zoom/telehealth visits: o To attest the resident's note, create your own note in Epic and pull in the ' Telephone Visit Attending Resident Attestation' using the .attestation smart phrase . Summarize or time stamp the visit based on resident level of training to ensure that there is some documentation of precepting . Prescriptions o You send all prescriptions for unlicensed providers. The refills for these prescriptions get sent automatically from the pharmacy to the authorizing provider, so refills will come directly to you and you should refill them as appropriate for any resident provider. o Always check to see if you have any unsigned prescriptions in your in basket before you leave clinic. Metrics that matter Items required for meaningful use have changed over time. Instead, we are focusing on specific metrics that require special attention for documentation. o Medication reconciliation - click on 'Verified' within Medication section o Computerized provider order entry (meds, labs, radiology) o Enter E&M code - under LOS section in Epic o WCC documentation - use WCC templates in Epic to pass CHDP audits o Postpartum documentation - must complete CPSP postpartum form once for each postpartum patient within 21- 56 days postpartum to pass CPSP audit Please get in the habit of checking ALL the above items while precepting with a r esident. Please give residents feedback if they're not doing the above. Formatted: Centered 31 Working with Clinician of the Day The Clinician of the Day, also known as the COD, is a role usually filled by an NP/PA. It is important for an attending to understand the COD role because you fulfill the responsibilities below if the COD is sick/unavailable/out. COD is announced in huddle during each clinic session and can be found on the FHC's google clinic schedule . COD primary responsibilities: Manage clinic flow Identify providers who are backed up in clinic and redistribute their patients to other providers who have no-shows or have open slots. o Must communicate with the provider prior to redistribution of patients. o They are actively trying to make sure residents see their target number of patients each session Serve as consultants for drop -in triage RN to help identify open slots for same -day drop -in patients Help to manage the provider pool in basket as needed. Hold the COD banana phone x60731. Located in the red team care station. Pick up at the beginning of each shift and return at the end of each shift onto its charger. Recommend starting an Epic secure chart with all the 81/85/91 attendings to streamline in clinic communication. Resident of the Day There will be a Resident of the Day, also known a s ROD, assigned to MOST clinic days. The primary responsibilities of the ROD are: o See same day drop -in or urgent patients. o See patients redistributed by COD or attending from providers who are backed up in clinic. Since the ROD also serves as a \"back -up\" resident for the residency program, they are NOT always available to see patients in clinic. If the ROD is pulled to fulfill other clinical responsibilities for their colleagues, the COD and nursing team will be notified. o Onsite back -up admin reside nt: if the ROD has been pulled and there are > 3 patients waiting to be seen in drop -in, you can call the chiefs (530) 424 -9412 to request that the onsite back -up resident come to help with drop -in. You can see if there is a back -up admin resident available for that clinic session on the FHC Google Sc hedule. Back -up admin residents are not available every shift. If the ROD is available and does not have patients (especially at the beginning of the session), please work with the COD to ensure the ROD sees their target number of patients during the clini c session. Remind the ROD to check the drop in pool in basket during their shift. ROD and drop-in residents are expected to check it once per shift for any urgent lab or phone follow -up and/or anticipated patients coming into drop- in. Onsite back -up admin resident : if the ROD has been pulled and there are > 3 patients waiting to be seen in drop -in, you can call the chiefs (530) 424 -9412 to request that the onsite back -up resident come to help with drop -in. You can see if there is a back -up adm in resident available for that clinic session on the FHC Google Schedule. Back -up admin residents are not available every shift. Formatted: Centered 32 Evening Clinic Attending Responsibilities If you are running late , please let Alanna Labat know as early as possible so she can get someone to cover for you. Manage flow so that all patients are out of the clinic by 9:00pm. o There are a lot of urgent, transfer or new patient appointments scheduled in evening clinics. Please look at the clinic schedule during huddle to plan for possible tetrising or shuffling of patients if a provider is backed up. Guidelines for moving pati ents around : Move adults from one provider to another before you move kids. Ask providers before you move a patient to another provider in case they know the patient and want to see them. o Nursing and security staffing is only available until 9:00. o Please anticipate if a patient work- up is going to take longer, initiate transfer to the ED before 8:30. Provider Pool: sign in at the start of the shift and review \"Rx requests\", \"Patient Calls\", and \"Results\". Responsibilities FHC Same -Day Drop- in clinic Patients can be seen on a first -come, first -serve basis They are briefly triaged by an RN then distributed to either ROD, DI, or any unfilled appointment slots throughout clinic (patients register after being triaged) Your role as attending for drop -in clinic You will work directly with triage RN to manage clinic flow and assist in distributing same -day drop in patients to the residents on the red team, especially if COD is unavailable. On occasion, you will be asked to go over to the triage area to see a patient if the triage RN has patient management questions Plea se note that any patients in triage with acute or urgent needs should not be given urgent appointments in the evening. o These patients would most likely benefit from an UCC or ED transfer Only straightforward, non -acute patients should be scheduled into a vailable appointments in the evening when patients were triaged in the morning or afternoon. FHC Drop -In Pool: check -in with the residents regarding the FHC Drop- In Pool. Drop- in residents are expected to check it once per shift for any urgent lab or pho ne follow -up and/or anticipated patients coming into drop- in. If no COD is available : the 81 attending becomes the COD (please see section above on COD) Help check provider pool in basket: the 81 attending checks the Rx requests tab in the provider pool in basket , but if you have downtime, please help check the remainder of the provider pool o Prescription Refills: Only need to do refills for resident PCPs, not for faculty/NP/PA PCPs. You can opt to refill for all if you find that method easier. Criteria for refilling non-controlled substance medication Review patient's medication list Patient must have had 1 visit with an FHC provider within the last 12 months o For high risk medication , you can give a 30- day supply and ask pharmacy to tell patient to make a f/u appointment before more refills are given. o For chronic medications , complete 90- day supplies along with 3 refills o If unclear whether patient has been seen in last 12 months If the medication seems essential, you can refill for 30 -day at your discretion and request for patient to follow -up with an appointment. If the medication is non -essential, you can leave for PCP to decide. If you have a question about a medication refill : You can route the refill request to the PCP if not urgent If urgent , please page or call PCP directly as many providers are only at the FHC once a week Criteria for refilling controlled substance medication (should only be refilled for 30- days unless o therwise specified by PCP) Check Epic to review last PCP note specifying the plan for refills. Formatted: Centered 34 o Review CURES o Under Chart Review -> Media, look for a \"pain agreement\" or search within chart for a \"controlled substance agreement\" o Consider ordering a urine toxicology test if not up to date If there is a plan for refills , it is ok to give refills if clearly indicated by PCP in their note. If there is no plan but you feel that the patient should have a refill (due to lack of appts available for pts, etc. ), then refill for a month and make sure that the patient has a clear follow -up plan. Be sure to inform PCP via TE. If there is no plan and you don't think a refill is appropriate , send a high priority TE to the PCP. On Fridays , all refill requests must be completed by the end of the afternoon session. You may ask the COD or 85 attendings for assistance if you are not able to get through the provider pool in basket . If there are still refills left when everyone leaves on Friday, you must let Alanna Labat know . o See FHC Lab Triage Protocol Help check resident in baskets: o Inter -visit patient care and in basket management are integral to outpatient primary care. As outpatient preceptors, it is imperative that we teach and model in basket work with the residents. o Each shift : Check -in with the residents regarding their in basket. Clinic attendings are expected to be the primary resource for residents for in basket management questions. Ask residents if they have clinical or logistical questions regarding in basket tasks. Proactively look through resident in baskets as a way to help them even if they say they don't need help Provide tips on how to manage and clear it ems in their in baskets Remind residents that the in- clinic attendings are an excellent resource for questions in real time and they can call into the attending rooms if they are offsite. \u00a7 In basket items should not be deferred or routed to the FTL unles s the resident has already communicated with their practice partner and chiefs about the need for additional FTL support. For reference, the resident practice partner tipsheet , including resident - specific expectations for in basket management, can be found here . o Practice Partner list for 2021 -2022 At the end of your precepting session, ensure that all patients have left the clinic by checking all the exam rooms. Attendings MUST stay on site until all patients have left the FHC. Best Practices: o Arrive to huddle on time to model the importance of huddle attendance to our learners o Ensure all drop in residents are at huddle. If not present, you can wait 10 minutes to see if they arrive. I f after 10 minutes, they have not arrived please call the chiefs on the chief line at 530 -424- 9412 for assistance. o Use secure chat as a way to the communicate with all team members present in clinic o If you are COD, hold the COD phone. 35 o Consider working on the computer closest to the door in the 81 precepting room so that you can see down the hallway and monitor what is happening in the waiting room and assist as needed to de-escalate any situations that may arise. o On your schedule in Epic, consider making a sub -schedule called \"drop in\" and add the drop in resident and drop in RN schedules to make it easier to monitor drop in flow. o Have Notion/COVID Central/FHC updates email google doc pulled up on your computer as a resource to show residents where they c an find various info during your precepting session o At the last hour of your precepting shift, determine if you will need help with the provider pool and if so, contact the other preceptors and/or COD for assistance . 36 o W85 Attending Responsibilities Resident teaching: o R2 Linkage on Mon AM and Wed AM with chronic care teaching from 8:30 -9am. o R3 Linkage on Wed PM and Fri PM o We aim to have a consistent group of preceptors for the linkage sessions to provide continuity for residents and patient care. o Chronic Care curriculum and Senior (R2 and R3) Linkage Review: Lydia will email all involved attendings with updates and scheduling plans. Precept both in person and telehealth residents. Please contact Alanna if you need a lapt op for zoom precepting. If no COD is available, assist the 81 attending to monitor clinic flow Assist the 85 nursing teams and provide clinical support as needed Help check provider pool in basket: ensure you are logged in to view the \"provider pool\" on your in basket. Review \"patient calls\", \"patient advice requests\", \"results\" and all other tabs in the provider pool. Do not need to review \"Rx requests\". Patient Calls: m edication refills and review documents Only need to do refills for resident PCPs, not for faculty/NP/PA PCPs. You can opt to refill for all if you find that method easier. See 81 attending responsibilities section on prescription refills above Patient calls o The SFGH Medical Records department has very clear instructions about what should be routed here for FHC attendings to check. o At times, you may have in basket items routed from the RN or Clinical Support pool that needs provider follow -up. We have asked that only resident PCP items be routed to the Provider Pool if urgent follow -up is needed. Review labs and diagnostic studies Results You can use the guidelines for review of abnormal lab reports to understand when you should: o Outreach to patients during a clinic session and simply sign out/send info to PCP as FYI o Send a TE or page a provider to hand off next steps for a lab/study result o Leave the lab/result for PCP to take care of On Fridays , all lab/study results must be reviewed by th e end of the afternoon session. o Remember: you may ask the COD or 8 1 attending for assistance if you are not able to get through the in basket . o If there are still labs to review after everyone leaves on Friday, you must contact Alanna Labat.

For reference, the residen t practice partner tipsheet , including resident - specific expectations for in basket management, can be found here . Practice Partner list for 2021 -2022 Zoom attending Zoom attending duties have now been incorporated into the 85 attending duties, unless otherwise specified. If there is not enough space to safely physically distant at the FHC, we may convert resident continuity clinics to all telehealth visits. Usually there should be no more than 1 -2 residents on telephone visit -only clinics. These residents will be listed un der the Telephone Clinics on the FHC Google Clinic Schedule . Attendings must monitor their secure chat messages in Epic, which will change to orange when there is a message, and re -assign any patients as needed to an available provider . The attending who is taking responsibility for moving the patient will reply to the provider who requested support and to the other preceptors via secure cha t so that the communication loop is closed. Additional tip : If you are reassigning scheduled patients to someone else, please 'Change Provider to Me' at the end of the clinic session. If you do it in advance, the slot that is opened on the original provide r's template could be filled by the CCC/NAL without your knowledge. Best to wait until the end of the clinic. For more details regarding the Zoom precepting workflow, please review the Zoom standard work . Newcomers Health Program (NHP) Green team R2 and R3 residents see patients who receive their asylee/refugee health screenings through the Newcomers Health Program. The screenings comprise of 2 visits, an initial health assessment with special attention paid to mental health screening and a follow -up visit to review labs/studies results. o There is a special state -mandated medical form that the residents must fill out. o After the initial visit, there is a follow- up appointment. o NHP patients have a very specific list of labs/studies to complete as part of their health assessment, depending on their country of origin. If you ever have questions about these screenings , the Newcomer s staff is a great resource. Their office is loca ted directly across from the Green Team care team room. At the end of your precepting session, ensure that all patients have left the clinic by checking all the exam rooms. Attendings MUST stay on site until all patients have left the FHC. Best Practices: o Arrive to huddle on time to model the importance of huddle attendance to our learners o Ensure all residents on your team are at huddle. If not present, you can wait 10 minutes to see if they arrive. If after 10 minutes, they have not arrived ple ase call the chiefs on the chief line at 530 - 424-9412 for assistance. o Use secure chat as a way to the communicate with all team members present in clinic 38 o On your schedule in Epic, consider making a sub- schedule called \"precepting\" and add the gold/green/telehealth residents; schedules to make it easier to monitor clinic flow. o If there are residents doing telehealth, log into zoom and secure chat them to make sure they are on Epic to do their telehealth clinic. o Have Notion/COVID Central/FHC updates email goo gle doc pulled up on your computer as a resource to show residents where they can find various info during your precepting session o At the last hour of your precepting shift, determine if you will need help with the provider pool and if so, contact the othe r preceptors and/or COD for assistance Intern Linkage Attending Responsibilities Intern Linkage Resident teaching: o Perinatal linkage usually the second Thursday of each month from 1 -1:30pm: Kimmy will email all attendings with updates and scheduling plans o Outpatient family medicine linkage on designated Thursdays from 1 -1:30pn: Lydia will email all involved attendings with updates and scheduling plans o We aim to have a consistent group of preceptors for the linkage sessions to provide continuity for residents and patient care. o It is crucial that you prepare for these sessions by looking over the materials that are emailed to you prior so that resident learning and your knowledge about the FHC specific workflows/practices are enhanced. A great deal of energy and time is put into making the handouts/modules so please use and refer to them.

The primary responsibilities of the ROD are: o See same day drop -in or urgent patients. o See patients redistributed by COD or attending from providers who are backed up in clinic. Since the ROD also serves as a \"back -up\" resident for the residency program, they are NOT always available to see patients in clinic. If the ROD is pulled to fulfill other clinical responsibilities for their colleagues, the COD and team leads (RNs) will b e notified. If the ROD is available and does not have patients (especially at the beginning of the session), please work with the COD to ensure the ROD sees their target number of patients during the clinic session. Evening Clinic Attending: Special Responsibilities If you are running late, please let Ebony Labat know as early as possible so she can get someone to cover for you. Manage flow so that all patients are out of the clinic by 9:00pm. o There are a lot of urgent, transfer or new patient appointments scheduled in evening clinics. Take a look at the clinic schedule during huddle to plan for possible tetrising or shuffling of patients if a provider is backed up. Guidelines for moving patients around: Move adults from one provider to another before you move kids. Ask providers before you move a patient to another provider in case they know the patient and intend to see them. o Nursing and security staffing is only available until 9:00. o Please anticipate if a patient work -up is going to take longer, initiate transfer to the ED or UCC starting at 8:30. Medication refills: Check the 'T' and 'E' jellybeans when you start your shift. Lab and diagnostic review: Check 'L' jellybeans when you start your shift.

On occasion, you will be asked to go over to the triage area to see a patient if the triag e RN has patient management questions Please note that any patients in triage with acute or urgent needs should not be given UR appointments in the evening. o These patients would most likely benefit from a UCC or ED transfer Only straightforward, non -acute patients should be given UR appointment in the evening when patients were triaged in the morning or afternoon. Prescription Refills Criteria for refill ing non -controlled substance medication o Check Epic and LCR to make sure medication is on the patient's active medication list o Patient must have had 1 visit with an FHC provider within the last 12 months For high -risk medication, you can give a 30 -day supply and ask pharmacy to tell patient to make a f/u appointment before more refills are given. o For chronic medications, complete 90 -day supplies along with 3 refills o If unclear whether patient has been seen in la st 12 months If the medication seems essential, you can refill for 30 -day at your discretion and request for patient to follow -up If the mediation is non -essential, you can leave for PCP to decide If you have a question about a medication refill: o You can send a 'TE' to PCP if not urgent o If urgent, please page or call PCP directly as many providers are only at the FHC once a week Criteria for refilling controlled substance medication (should only be refilled for 30-days unless otherwise specified by PCP) o Check Epic to see if there is a clinical alert specifying the plan for refills. o If there is a plan for refills, it is ok to giv e refills if clearly spelled out by PCP in Epic .
