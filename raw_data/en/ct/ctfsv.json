This was from a recent 'animal healing ' class. Students who attended this class had completed the two 'Activate the healer' classes. In these two 'activate the healer classes', you will learn how to facilitate healing for yourself, others and situations, hands on and remotely. In this first class you will receive a reiki level one attunement. After this attunement you will be able to run healing energy through your hands, eyes, breath and feet. Sara will teach you a self healing protocol and a hands on healing protocol for others and animals. Once you have practiced being a vessel for healing energy, you are ready for the second class which includes a level two reiki attunement. After your second attunement you will be able to send remote healing energy to people, animals, places and situations anywhere on or off the planet, past present or future. It's important to understand you are the vessel. The energy runs through you, it doesn't come from your own energy supply. The more you allow the energy to flow through you without any agenda, manipulation, attachments, the more powerful the results. I suggest being humble and generous in how you facilitate reiki. I'm offering this class as a sliding scale. Level one 8/1 9.30am - 11.00am PST payment scale $25 - $100 If you've already been attuned to either reiki level one or two a while ago and have been inactive, you can get a motivational reboot by joining these classes. Classes are via zoom. Sara Fancy has been practicing energy medicine since 2000. She graduated in polarity healing arts school as an RPP (registered polarity practitioner) and became a master reiki healer in 2004. Sara has taught numerous students how to facilitate healing for themselves, their animals and for difficult situations in their lives.
