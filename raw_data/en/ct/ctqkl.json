It has long been understood that cystic fibrosis (CF) patient sputum contains elevated iron concentrations. However, anaerobic bacteria have been isolated from CF sputum and hypoxic zones in sputum have been measured. Because ferrous iron [Fe(II)] is stable in reducing, acidic conditions, it could exist in the CF lung. I show that a two-\u00adcomponent system, BqsRS, specifically responds to Fe(II) in the CF pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Concurrently, a clinical study found that Fe(II) is present in CF sputum at all stages of lung function decline. Fe(II), not Fe(III), correlates with patients in the most severe disease state. Furthermore, transcripts of the newly identified BqsRS were detected in sputum. Two-\u00adcomponent systems are the main method that bacteria use to interact with their extracellular environment. A typical two-\u00adcomponent system contains a sensor histidine kinase, which upon activation phosphorylates a response regulator that then acts as a transcription factor to elicit a cellular response to stimuli. To explore the mechanism of BqsRS, I describe the Fe(II)-\u00adsensing RExxE motif in the sensor BqsS and determine the consensus DNA sequence BqsR binds. With the BqsR binding sequence, I identify novel regulon members through bioinformatic and molecular biology techniques. From the predicted function of new BqsR regulon members, I find that Fe(II) elicits a response that globally protects the cells against cationic stressors, including clinically relevant antibiotics. Subsequently, I use BqsR as a case study to determine if promoter outputs can accurately be predicted based only on a deep understanding of a v transcriptional activator's operator, or if a broader regulatory context is required for accurate predictions at all genomic loci. This work highlights the importance of Fe(II) as a (micro)environmental factor, even in conditions typically thought of as aerobic. Since the presence of Fe(II) can alter P. aeruginosa's antibiotic susceptibility, combining the current strategy of targeting Fe(III) with a new approach targeting Fe(II) may help eradicate infections in the CF lung in the future. vi TABLE OF CONTENTS Acknowledgements ............................................................................................ iii Abstract .............................................................................................................. iv Table of Contents ............................................................................................... vi List of Illustrations and/or Tables ..................................................................... vii Chapter I: Introduction ...................................................................................... 1 Chapter summaries ...................................................................................... 4 References ................................................................................................... 7 Chapter II: BqsR/BqsS constitute aeruginosa ................................................ 8 References The ferrous iron responsive BqsRS two-\u00adcomponent system activates genes that promote cationic stress tolerance .................................. 46 References ................................................................................................. 90 Chapter IV: Broader regulatory context outweighs operator occupation in predicting genome-\u00adwide regulation in bacteria ............................................ 107 Supplemental Material ............................................................................ 143 References ............................................................................................... 165 Chapter V: Future directions ..........................................................................

It is used in Fe-\u00adsulfur clusters, heme-\u00adcontaining enzymes, and as active centers in metalloenzymes. In biological systems, free iron is rarely available, because ferric iron [Fe(III)] is insoluble and ferrous iron [Fe(II)] is toxic. In aerobic environments, Fe(II)'s toxicity is mediated through the Fenton reaction, which generates hydroxyl radicals that attack biological macromolecules. Fe(II) has also been shown to have toxicity in anaerobic systems, though the mechanisms are not well understood (2, 3). Fe bioavailablity is especially important for pathogenic bacteria, as the host and bacteria compete for Fe resources. Many bacteria can live in a biofilm growth mode, where the bacteria live in a community within an excreted extracellular matrix. To live in a biofilm the environmental Fe concentration must be just right, as too little Fe prevents biofilm formation (4, 5) and too much Fe causes biofilm dispersal (6). Bacteria living in biofilms are more resistant to antibiotic treatment than free-\u00adliving cells. Bacteria harness many methods to ensure they have the ideal Fe intracellular concentrations. This includes a remarkably diverse set of iron scavenging systems as well as regulatory networks that respond to the intracellular Fe concentrations (see Fig. 1-\u00ad1). This includes siderophores, heme, and ferric citrate iron acquisition systems. In particular I will focus on those in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen best-\u00adknown in the context of lung infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. In addition, other patients most susceptible to Pseudomonas infections are burn victims, neutropenic patients, and patients with pneumonia (7). Pseudomonas also contains two 2 heme uptake systems whose outer membrane receptors are HasR and PhuR, which are energized by an ABC transporter and TonB complex, respectively (8).The TonB complex consists of the inner membrane protein TonB, which spans the periplasmic space and associates with outer membrane iron receptors, as well as two inner membrane accessory proteins ExbB and ExbD. It is driven by the proton motive force and allows active import through the outer membrane (9). Another method of iron acquisition is through the chelator citrate. Excreted citrate binds Fe(III) and is sensed by the outer membrane receptor FecA. Fe(III) is reduced to Fe(II) in the periplasm and the G-\u00adcoupled Fe(II)-\u00adspecific FeoB transporter allows iron into cell synthesizes two siderophores, pyoverdine and 1024-\u00ad27 M-\u00ad1 and 105 M-\u00ad1, respectively (11). The iron affinity for pyoverdine is so great that it can strip iron from CF host immune system associated Fe-\u00adcarriers, lactoferrin (12) and serum Fe transporters, ferritin (13). Iron-\u00adloaded siderophores are sensed by outer membrane embedded receptors and iron is actively transported into the cell through the TonB complex. There are two receptor proteins associated with pyoverdine FpvA and FpvB. Both are required for Fe(III) uptake; it is thought that Fe(III) is reduced to Fe(II) in the periplasm allowing Fe to enter the cell and for Fe free pyoverdine recycling. Additionally, FpvA also interacts with and extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factor/anti-\u00adsigma factor system FpvR/PvdS, allowing for Fe uptake feedback. Pyochelin uptake differs in that Fe(III)-\u00adpyochelin enters the periplasm through FptA then the complex is transported into the cytosol, where pyochelin is degraded to release Fe(III). 3 Most Fe studies have focused on Fe(III), the assumption being that Fe(III) is the iron species most commonly encountered because in the presence of oxygen Fe(II) is readily converted to Fe(III). However, Fe(II) is stable under reducing, acidic conditions. For example, the Fe(II) transporter FeoB is upregulated in low iron, low oxygen conditions (14). The master regulator responsible for the cell's global iron response is Fur. When the cell is iron-\u00adreplete, Fe(II) binds Fur, which then acts as a repressor for all iron acquisition genes. Free cytosolic iron is always Fe(II); therefore, Fur represses its regulon regardless of Fe speciation. However, some extracellular iron sensing systems exist in bacteria. Previously, a Fe(III) sensing two-\u00adcomponent system (TCS), PmrAB, was described. TCSs are the main mechanism bacteria interact with their extracellular environment and the simplest type is composed of a sensor histidine kinase that phosphorylates its cognate response regulator, which then acts as a transcription factor. Here, I describe the first bacterial Fe(II)-\u00adspecific TCS, BqsRS in P. aeruginosa that starts sensing Fe(II) at low micromolar Fe(II) concentrations. Fe(II) sensing is important for P. aeruginosa because Fe(II) has been found in CF sputum at concentrations where BqsRS is active (15). Furthermore, only Fe(II) correlates with severe lung function decline (15). The sickest patients have bacteria immersed in an environment not typically studied, which may change bacterial metabolism affecting the efficacy of typical antimicrobial therapies. Recently, another Fe(II)-\u00adresponsive TCS FirRS has been described in another pathogen, Haemophilus influenzae. 4 Figure 1-\u00ad1. Iron acquisition and sensing in P. aeruginosa. Outer membrane iron receptors are energized, usually through the TonB complex. Ferric [Fe(III)]-\u00adsiderophores are brought into the (Pvd) and FptA for uptake is performed by FecA. The two heme uptake receptors are HasR and PhuR. Because ferrous iron [Fe(II)] is soluble, it is thought to diffuse into the periplasm through outer membrane porins. Iron is actively transported into the cytosol, although all the proteins are not known (indicated by dashed line). FeoB brings Fe(II) into the cytosol. Individual extracellular Fe(III)-\u00adcomplexed Fe sources are sensed by receptors associated with ECF anti-\u00adsigma factor/sigma factor systems, such as the FpvR/PvdS pyoverdine sensing system. Fur, the master iron regulator, represses all iron acquisition systems (including PvdS function) in Fe replete conditions. The Fe(II)-\u00adspecific two-\u00adcomponent system, BqsRS is the first bacterial extracellular Fe(II)-\u00adsensing system characterized. Three lines indicate sensing and blue indicates a regulator. Overview Chapter 2. Can bacteria distinguish between extracellular Fe(II) and Fe(III)? I identify an operon containing a two-\u00adcomponent system, BqsRS, through a microarray experiment comparing Fe(II) shocked cells to Fe(III) shocked cells. By comparing bqsR and bqsS 5 deletion mutants to WT and feoB mutant deficient in Fe(II) uptake, I show that BqsRS is responsible for extracellular Fe(II) sensing. BqsRS specifically responds to Fe(II) and not to other physiologically relevant dipositive ions. Chapter 3. How does Fe(II) affect aeruginosa through BqsRS? The periplasmic RExxE motif in BqsS is required for Fe(II) sensing and the consensus DNA sequence BqsR binds is shown. I observe that bqsR/S mutants have a severe growth defect in high Fe(II). Based on the predicted function of newly identified BqsR regulon members, I find two new phenotypes. bqsR/S mutants grown in high Fe(II) produce less spermidine than WT and are more sensitive than WT in high Fe(II) to aminoglycosides and polymyxins. I hypothesize this resistance is a pleiotropic effect from WT cells making their surface charge more positive, and thus providing resistance against only positively charged stressors, rather than acting as a general stress response mechanism. Chapter 4. Are PWM missing critical information encoded in the operator or does the surrounding regulatory context dominate promoter outputs? I use the BqsR operator as a test case. Position weight matrices (PWM) are useful for generating hypotheses, but vastly over-\u00adpredict transcription factor binding sites that have a regulatory consequence. Through bioinformatic genome analysis and generation of a promoter mutant library, I develop an energy binding based model of the BqsR operator. I find that while my model modestly outperforms PWM (generated in chapter 3), the surrounding regulatory parameters such as the presence of other transcription factor binding sites are more important in predicting promoter output. 6 Chapter 5. Where do we go from here? I suggest possible future experiments to address remaining questions. Appendix A. How does Fe(II) impact the previously observed BqsRS-\u00addependent rhamnolipid associated phenotypes (16)? I examine the effect of Fe(II) shock on rhamnolipid production and find that rhamnolipid concentration increases in both WT and bqsR strains. The quorum sensing regulator RhlR is responsible for rhamnolipid production. I examine how rhlR, bqsR, and WT grow in minimal media in different carbon sources because rhlR grows much longer in exponential phase and to a higher maximum density than WT and bqsR. Appendix B. Do other organism sense Fe(II) through the RExxE motif? A phylogenetic analysis reveals this motif is limited to Pseudomonaceae family; almost all strains in the Pseudomonas genus with a single Cellvibrio and Azotobacter strain. It would be interesting to test variants of the Fe(II)-\u00adsensing motif observed for their ability to bind Fe(II). 7 References 1. Wandersman C, Delepelaire P. 2004.

In this context, it is thought to form biofilms, within which locally reducing and acidic conditions can develop that favor the stability of ferrous iron [Fe(II)]. Because iron is a signal that stimulates biofilm formation, we performed a microarray study to determine whether P. aeruginosa strain PA14 exhibits a specific transcriptional response to extracellular Fe(II). Among the genes that were most upregulated in response to Fe(II) were those encoding the two-\u00adcomponent system BqsR/BqsS, previously identified for its role in P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 biofilm decay (1); here, we demonstrate its role in extracellular Fe(II) sensing. bqsS and bqsR form an operon together with two small upstream genes, bqsP and bqsQ, and one downstream gene, bqsT. BqsR/BqsS sense extracellular Fe(II) at physiologically relevant concentrations (>10 M) and elicit a specific transcriptional response, including its autoregulation. The sensor distinguishes The gene that is most upregulated by BqsR/BqsS, as measured by quantitative reverse transcription-\u00adPCR (qRT-\u00adPCR), is PA14_04180, which is predicted to encode a periplasmic oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-\u00adbinding domain (OB-\u00adfold) protein. Coincident with phenazine production during batch culture growth, Fe(II) becomes the majority of the total iron pool and bqsS is upregulated. The existence of a two-\u00adcomponent system that senses Fe(II) indicates that extracellular Fe(II) is an important environmental signal for P. aeruginosa. 10 Introduction Iron is an essential element for nearly all forms of life. Iron generally presents itself to biological systems in one of two oxidation states: ferric [Fe(III)] or ferrous [Fe(II)] iron. Given that Fe(II) is oxidized by atmospheric oxygen, it is commonly assumed that organisms most frequently acquire iron in the Fe(III) form. In oxic environments at a circumneutral pH, Fe(II) rapidly oxidizes to Fe(III), precipitating as sparingly soluble ferric (hydr)oxide minerals (2). Within living systems, host proteins, such as members of the transferrin family, bind Fe(III) (3, 4). Given Fe(III)'s low solubility, considerable attention has been paid to Fe(III) sensing and acquisition by bacteria, and much is understood about these processes (5-\u00ad8). Less is understood about Fe(II) sensing and uptake, despite the fact that many environments contain Fe(II) (9, 10) and that increased solubility of Fe(II) renders it more bioavailable than Fe(III) (2). In particular, Fe(II) is known to be important in acidic and/or reducing environments (2, 11, 12), and such conditions can easily arise at the microscale in diverse habitats (13, 14), including biofilms (15). Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-\u00adnegative bacterium capable of aerobic and anaerobic respiration. It inhabits many environments, ranging from soils (16) to marine sediments (17). It is best known as an opportunistic pathogen that infects immunocompromised individuals and, in particular, the mucus that accumulates on the surface of lung epithelial cells in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). Within this environment, Pseudomonas is thought to form biofilms\u2014sessile, multicellular communities (18, 19) that are more resistant to conventional antimicrobial therapies 11 than are their free-\u00adliving counterparts (20). P. aeruginosa requires iron to form cofactors of enzymes that play essential roles in electron transfer and other important cellular processes. Iron also signals biofilm formation (21, 22), but the level of iron necessary to promote biofilm formation exceeds that required for assimilatory purposes (23, 24). In addition, the production of several virulence determinants, such as exotoxin A, is regulated in response to iron (25). P. aeruginosa can acquire iron in several ways. One strategy is to secrete high-\u00adaffinity Fe(III)-\u00adbinding molecules, called siderophores, which outcompete transferrin and other host proteins for Fe(III) (5). For example, pyoverdine is one of the dominant siderophores made by P. aeruginosa. When pyoverdine-\u00adbound Fe(III) enters the periplasm via TonB-\u00addependent outer membrane transporters, iron is thought to be released from the pyoverdine complex via reduction facilitated by its binding to an inner membrane ABC transporter, allowing Fe(II) to enter the cytoplasm (7). In addition, P. aeruginosa can excrete citrate, which also chelates Fe(III), albeit with lower affinity than siderophores, causing the iron to enter the cytoplasm as Fe(II) through a different TonB-\u00addependent porin and the G-\u00adprotein-\u00adlike transporter FeoB (26, 27). Pseudomonas also contains two heme uptake systems whose outer membrane receptors are HasR and PhuR, which are energized by an ABC transporter and TonB, respectively (28). Limiting cells for Fe(III) has received considerable attention from a therapeutic perspective (22, 29, 30). This is because Fe(III) limitation has been shown to significantly reduce biofilm formation in various in vitro systems (22). However, these systems are commonly operated under aerobic conditions and may not reflect in vivo conditions. 12 Some evidence suggests anaerobic niches may exist in CF lung mucus where bacteria form dense biofilms (31), and biofilms themselves are known to harbor microdomains that are more acidic (15) or more reducing (32) than the bulk environment. Because steep chemical gradients can develop within biofilms over a small spatial scale (14), it is reasonable to expect that Fe(II) could exist in appreciable amounts in these microhabitats. Although the dominant iron oxidation state in the CF lung is unclear (33), it likely changes as infections progress and the local environment becomes increasingly reducing. On a related note, one reason to postulate that Fe(II) may be important for P. aeruginosa is that phenazines are known to be produced at micromolar concentrations in the CF lung (34). Phenazines can reduce host protein-\u00adbound Fe(III) (35), as well as Fe(III) bound up in mineral phases (36), to Fe(II). Fe(II) crosses the outer membrane via generic outer membrane porins and is actively transported across the cytoplasmic membrane via FeoB (26). Recently, it was shown that phenazine carboxylic acid can promote P. aeruginosa biofilm formation by stimulating Fe(II) acquisition in the presence of conalbumin (37). In addition, the presence of Fe(II) has been detected within a P. aeruginosa biofilm producing a gradient of the reduced phenazine pyocyanin (38). Given these observations, we hypothesized that P. aeruginosa might respond differently to Fe(II) than to Fe(III). To test this, we performed a microarray experiment to measure the transcriptional response to Fe(II) or Fe(III) shock. Not only did we observe different responses depending on the iron oxidation state, we identified a two-\u00adcomponent system that specifically senses extracellular Fe(II). 13 Results P. aeruginosa exhibits a transcriptional response that depends on the iron oxidation state. To determine if exogenous Fe(II) and Fe(III) are perceived differently at the cellular level by P. aeruginosa strain PA14, we used Affymetrix P. aeruginosa GeneChips to identify transcriptional changes in response to Fe(II) or Fe(III). To ensure that the iron oxidation state remained stable, strain PA14 was cultured anaerobically as described in Materials and Methods. Upon reaching exponential phase, triplicate cultures were exposed to approximately 100 M Fe(II), 100 M Fe(III), or water for 30 min, and total RNA was extracted, labeled, and hybridized to P. aeruginosa Affymetrix GeneChips. In both the Fe(II) and Fe(III) shock conditions, relative to the no-\u00adiron control, iron-\u00adscavenging genes (e.g., pyochelin biosynthesis genes) were downregulated, as expected (see the supplemental material). To determine if any genes specifically responded to Fe(II), we compared the Fe(II) and Fe(III) shock treatments. Cultures exposed to extracellular Fe(II) displayed an expression profile that was distinct from that of Fe(III)-\u00adexposed cultures (Table 2-\u00ad1). We found 3 genes that were downregulated and 18 genes that were upregulated at least 2-\u00adfold by Fe(II) with qvalues of 0.01. Of the upregulated genes, a putative operon containing two short putative membrane proteins with PepSY domains and a putative two-\u00adcomponent system showed the highest upregulation (Table 2-\u00ad1). 14 TABLE 2-\u00ad1. Exogenous Fe (II) upregulates a specific subset of genes in PA14 Genes probable transcription protein L32 * of these genes is controlled by the PA2657 (bqsR) response regulator as shown in Figure 2-\u00ad3. To determine whether these genes constitute an operon, we performed RT-\u00adPCR. All of the genes from PA14_29710 to PA14_ 29750 appear to be transcriptionally connected (Fig. 2-\u00ad1), and thus we refer to this operon as the bqsPQRST operon, because homologs of BqsS and BqsR (exhibiting 100% amino acid identity) were previously identified in P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 for their role in biofilm development and quorum sensing (1). Whether bqsT is a bona fide member of this operon is less clear, as qRT-\u00adPCR results (Fig. 2-\u00ad3) show lower fold change in this gene than in other members of the operon, possibly reflecting transcriptional bleed-\u00adthrough. Moreover, whereas all of the other members of the operon possess overlapping reading frames, there are 90 bp between bqsS and bqsT. The five-\u00adgene cluster is conserved in its entirety only among P. aeruginosa strains. Orthologs of the sensor BqsS are encoded in similar predicted operons with a response regulator and one or two PepSY domain-\u00adcontaining proteins across other Pseudomonas and Azotobacter species, but the fifth hypothetical gene is excluded. 16 Figure 2-\u00ad1. The bqs operon. (A) and a hypothetical protein (bqsT [PA14_29750]) The length of the arrows represents the size of the gene relative to other genes in the operon. (B) A 1% agarose gel confirming that bqs is an operon. The notation bqsP-\u00adbqsQ indicates, for example, in lanes 2-\u00ad4 PCR products were obtained using a forward primer within bqsP and a reverse primer within bqsQ. G denotes genomic DNA run as a positive control. mRNA -\u00adRT (reverse transcriptase) is a negative control to ensure there is no genomic DNA contamination in the mRNA. The presence of products in all of the cDNA lanes (mRNA +RT) reveals exogenous Fe(II) induced a two-\u00adcomponent system, because such systems are responsible for transmitting extracellular signals (e.g., the presence of ferrous iron) to the intracellular environment (53). This suggested that our two-\u00adcomponent system, comprising a cytoplasmic response regulator (bqsR) and a sensor histidine kinase (bqsS) and identified by its conserved kinase domain and its predicted localization to the inner membrane, was sensing extracellular Fe(II). To test this, we used qRT-\u00adPCR to measure the expression of bqsR and bqsS in response to Fe(II) shock in the 17 wild-\u00adtype (WT) strain and in strain feoB::MAR2xT7 [which has a severe defect in Fe(II) uptake across the cytoplasmic membrane (26, 27, 37)]. If the cells were sensing extracellular Fe(II), we anticipated that bqsR and bqsS expression would be the same in both the wild type and the feoB mutant. Alternatively, if the cells were sensing cytoplasmic Fe(II), we expected bqsR and bqsS to be upregulated in the wild type compared to their expression in the feoB mutant. P. aeruginosa strains PA14 and PA14 feoB::MAR2xT7 were cultured under anaerobic conditions until early exponential phase, at which time 63 M Fe(II) was added to the medium. After 30 min, the RNA was stabilized and extracted for qRT-\u00adPCR. As seen in Fig. 2-\u00ad2, bqsR and bqsS were upregulated in both the wild type and the feoB mutant upon Fe(II) shock, which indicates their expression is activated in response to extracellular Fe(II). Figure 2-\u00ad2. (gray bars) and mutant strain feoB:: MAR2xT7 (white bars) were cultured anaerobically in MMM. The feoB mutant strain has a severe defect in Fe(II) uptake. A 30 min Fe(II) shock and qRT-\u00adPCR was performed to analyze expression of bqsR and bqsS. Since the wild type and the mutant show the same levels of transcriptional response, Fe(II) must be extracellular. The bars represent the average of biological triplicates and the individual points indicate the fold change of each replicate. 18 Fe(II) response is due to the bqs operon. To gain insight into the mechanism of the extracellular Fe(II) shock transcriptional response, we examined expression of the nine genes most upregulated in the microarray (each having a fold change of 4) in strains lacking either the regulator (bqsR mutants) or the sensor (bqsS mutants) (Fig. 2-\u00ad3). Four of these genes are components of the bqs operon (bqsPQRST). Under anaerobic conditions, the bqsR mutant, bqsS mutant, and wild type were grown to early exponential phase and exposed to Fe(II). RNA was extracted for qRT-\u00adPCR analysis before and after 30 min of exposure. Our results reveal that BqsR/BqsS is autoregulated. When both BqsR and BqsS are present, Fe(II) the upregulation of the entire bqs operon (Fig. 2-\u00ad3). However, if either bqsR or bqsS is deleted, the bqs operon no longer to extracellular Fe(II). Complementation with bqsR expressed on pMQ64 resulted in an Fe(II) response similar to that of the wild type (Fig. 2-\u00ad3). The exception to this is expression of bqsR itself, which does not exhibit the same dramatic increase in expression with Fe(II) shock; this can be explained by the fact that before Fe(II) shock, bqsR is upregulated 75-\u00adfold compared to wild-\u00adtype levels because its expression is being driven off a multicopy plasmid. No data are presented for bqsR in both the bqsR mutant and the vector-\u00adonly control because no copies of bqsR are present and any values detected are within background error. The transcriptional responses of the five most highly upregulated genes outside this operon\u2014PA14_04180, PA14_07070, PA14_01240, PA14_01250, and on bqsR these genes, PA14_04180 shows the highest upregulation by qRT-\u00adPCR (Fig. 2-\u00ad3) and was the 19 fourth most upregulated in the microarray. In general, the strength of the transcriptional response in our qRT-\u00adPCR experiments was significantly higher than what we observed in the array study (Table 2-\u00ad3), which is not unexpected because qRT-\u00adPCR is a more sensitive technique than microarrays. Figure 2-\u00ad3. BqsS and BqsR are required for extracellular Fe(II) regulation. (A) WT (gray bars) and bqsS mutant (white bars) transcriptional fold change after Fe(II) shock, as measured by qRT-\u00adPCR. (B) WT (gray bars), bqsR mutant (white bars), bqsR mutant with pMQ64-\u00adbqsR (bqsR complement) (diagonal bars), and bqsR mutant with pMQ64 (vector-\u00adonly control) (hashed bars) transcriptional fold change after Fe(II) shock, as measured by 20 qRT-\u00adPCR. Both bqsR and bqsS are required for the Fe(II)-\u00adinduced upregulation of the bqs operon and upregulation the bqs regulon. bqsR::pMQ64-\u00adbqsR shows WT levels of upregulation. The bars are the averages of biological triplicates, and the individual points indicate the fold changes of each replicate. The bqs operon responds to low concentrations of extracellular Fe(II). Intrigued by the differential fold changes we observed in our qRT-\u00adPCR experiments, we hypothesized that the BqsS/BqsR-\u00admediated transcriptional response was tunable by the Fe(II) concentration. To test this, we performed an Fe(II) titration experiment, varying Fe(II) over an order of magnitude from 6 M to 60 M. A concentration of 20 M was the lowest concentration of Fe(II) to elicit a response for bqsR or bqsS; the maximum response was seen for >60 M Fe(II) (Fig. 2-\u00ad4). Figure 2-\u00ad4. Fe(II) titration curve. trials showing induction of a transcriptional response for bqsR (gray lines) and bqsS (dashed black lines) in response to increasing Fe(II) concentrations. The minimum Fe(II) concentration to elicit a response was 20 M, and the maximum fold change was seen with a concentration of 60 M. Additional replicates show similar trends. 21 The bqs operon is specific for Fe(II). Because some two-\u00adcomponent systems are induced by multiple external signals, we questioned whether BqsR/BqsS was specific for Fe(II). To determine this, we performed transcriptional shock experiments with five other dipositive cations that are commonly found in CF sputum (54). We also measured the transcriptional response to Fe(III) as a control. The wild type was cultured under either anaerobic or aerobic conditions and exposed to metal shock in early exponential phase. Fe(III), Ca(II), Cu(II), Mg(II), Mn(II), and Zn(II) under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions (Fig. 2-\u00ad5). From this, it appears that BqsR/BqsS is selective for ferrous iron. Notably, the extent of bqsS gene expression was attenuated in the aerobic Fe(II) shock experiment (Fig. 2-\u00ad5). The lower degree of upregulation can be explained by rapid oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III): the initial concentration of Fe(II) was 100 M, but after completion of the 30-\u00admin shock, the concentration was 4.9 M. 22 Figure 2-\u00ad5. bqsS responds specifically to Fe(II). Expression of bqsS under both anaerobic (gray bars) and aerobic (white bars) conditions after shock with Fe(II) and other cations. Metal concentrations of 100 M FeCl3, 100 M Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2, 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CaCl2, 100 M ZnCl2, 100 M CuCl2, and 100 M MnCl2 were used in the Mg(II), Ca(II), Zn(II), Cu(II), and Mn(II), respectively. The bars are the averages of biological triplicates, and the individual points indicate the fold changes of each replicate. The bqs operon is transcribed as Fe(II) is produced during growth. To explore the connection between bqs operon transcriptional induction and biological iron reduction in a wild-\u00adtype culture, a 27-\u00adh growth experiment was conducted in duplicate using PA14 grown in MOPS medium with an initial iron allocation of almost exclusively Fe(III) (Fig. 2-\u00ad6). OD500 measurements show a classical growth curve exhibiting exponential growth between approximately 10 and 18 h after inoculation. Pyocyanin, a type of phenazine, was detected in the culture starting in mid-\u00adexponential phase and continuing through the end of the experiment. The culture's iron oxidation state shifted from entirely Fe(III) at the beginning of the experiment to >85% Fe(II) by the end; this shift coincided with the exponential phase of growth and the presence of phenazines. qRT-\u00adPCR showed upregulation of bqsS during exponential phase, when extracellular Fe(II) was at a concentration of 125 M (well above the concentration needed to induce the bqs operon), and a repression of transcription in stationary phase. 23 Figure 2-\u00ad6. bqsR is transcribed over the course of growth as Fe(II) accumulates. Correlation between growth, phenazine production, iron reduction, and bqsR transcription in PA14. Growth curves (OD500) averaged for triplicate cultures of PA14 are plotted alongside the percentage of total Fe that were Fe(II). Bars indicate the average upregulation of bqsS (relative to recA) compared to cells grown without Fe and normalized to OD500. For the complete qPCR data set, see Table 2-\u00ad2.

To our knowledge, this is the first extracellular Fe(II) sensor described in bacteria. BqsR/BqsS autoregulates its own expression, is turned on by Fe(II) concentrations of >10 M, and does not respond to other physiologically relevant dipositive ions. Previously, BqsR/BqsS was shown to play a role in the dispersal of P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 biofilms (1). This appears to be due to the fact that biofilms lacking BqsR or BqsS produce lower concentrations of rhamnolipids, which are known to promote biofilm dispersal (55). Interestingly, bqsR and bqsS expression peaks during late exponential growth, in which cells are thought to experience conditions similar to those in biofilms (56, 57). The physiological context of bqsR and bqsS expression thus provides a satisfying link between our results and those of Dong et al.(1): as cell densities and phenazine concentrations rise, Fe(II) is generated, inducing bqsR and bqsS expression, which promotes biofilm dispersal. While several previous studies have indicated that moderate concentrations of iron are necessary to stimulate biofilm formation regardless of whether iron is in the ferric or ferrous form (21, 22), it has also been established that this phenomenon is concentration dependent: at sufficiently high concentrations, iron can promote biofilm dispersal (58). It thus seems likely that BqsR/BqsS acts as a \"gatekeeper\" to sense when Fe(II) concentrations have crossed the threshold where conditions are no longer favorable for biofilm maintenance. 25 That the BqsR/BqsS system responds specifically to extracellular Fe(II) but not Fe(III) was initially surprising, given that the PmrA/PmrB two-\u00adcomponent system is specific for extracellular Fe(III) but not Fe(II) (8). In a detailed study by W\u00f6sten et al. (8), it was shown that PmrB directly interacts with Fe(III) through glutamate residues in two HExxE motifs and a serine outside these motifs in the periplasmic region. BqsS contains a similar motif that could be responsible for directly sensing Fe(II), a theory which we plan to test biochemically. Of the 23 BqsS orthologs we identified across currently sequenced pseudomonads, only 14 are predicted to contain the putative Fe(II) binding motif; 7 of these are strains of P. aeruginosa. Once the BqsR Fe(II) binding motif is biochemically confirmed, it will be interesting to determine how the BqsR/BqsS regulon differs among these species. Not only does BqsS differentiate Fe(II) from Fe(III), it also distinguishes Fe(II) from other dipositive Zn(II), the wild type upregulate bqsS. This differs from the Fe(III)-\u00adsensing PmrA/PmrB system, which can also be activated by low extracellular Mg(II) (59) and mild acid (60). In addition, BqsR/BqsS are highly sensitive to Fe(II). The minimum Fe(II) level found to elicit a transcriptional response was 20 M; the response rapidly increased over a small concentration range, with the maximum response achieved by a concentration of 60 M. These levels of Fe(II) are well within physiologically relevant Fe(II) concentrations, as the Fe(II) concentration has been measured up to 110 M in CF sputum samples (R.C. Hunter and D. K. Newman, 26 unpublished data). Other studies have obtained sputum samples and measured total Fe concentrations, which range from approximately 20 M to 140 M (61). Both BqsP/BqsQ contain PepSY domains (Pfam accession number PF03413) (62) and are predicted to be single-\u00adpass transmembrane proteins by TMpred (63) and DAS (64). BqsP is predicted to share structural homology with the protein YycI from Bacillus subtilis (75% estimated precision using the Phyre homology modeling program) (65). YycI, along with another auxiliary protein, is known to regulate the kinase activity of a two-\u00adcomponent system, YycFG, through its transmembrane domain (66). Deleting YycI caused a 10-\u00adfold increase in expression of a lacZ kinase promoter fusion (32). Given the similarity between BqsP and YycI, it seems likely that BqsP/BqsQ play a similar role in modulating the kinase activity of BqsS. bqsT encodes a hypothetical protein that lacks conserved domains and has only very weak similarity to any known proteins. Orthologs to bqsT are only present in other P. aeruginosa strains, implying that, if it is a true member of the bqs operon, it has been integrated into the operon recently and may not serve a critical function. Strikingly, only a small number of genes in our microarray were upregulated in the Fe(II) shock condition compared to their levels in the Fe(III) shock condition, and we did not observe upregulation of pqsA, phnA (PQS biosynthesis), and rhlA (rhamnolipid production), as reported by Dong et al. (1). This is likely because we performed our shock experiment on cells harvested from early exponential phase. If BqsR/BqsS are involved in the regulation of genes that are also quorum regulated (i.e., pqsA, phnA, and rhlA) we would not have detected them. Another possibility is that the BqsR/BqsS 27 regulon is different in PA14 than in PAO1. Regardless, the \"core\" Fe(II)-\u00adsensitive BqsR/BqsS regulon is quite limited. This may be due to the fact that only Fe(II) enters and is sensed in the cytoplasm, no matter whether Fe(III) or Fe(II) is extracellular (Fig. 2-\u00ad7). Thus, the primary network of iron-\u00adresponsive genes would not need to distinguish between the two forms. Perhaps instead, extracellular Fe(II) is sensed to assess environmental conditions that foster Fe(II) formation. Fe(II) exists in reducing and acidic environments. Consistent with this, genes that respond to Fe(II) shock include PA14_01240, encoding carbonic anhydrase, and iscA, an acid response gene involved in iron-\u00adsulfur cluster biogenesis (67). Their protein products can help the cell adjust to an external decrease in pH. If the extracellular environment becomes more reducing, the disulfide bonds of periplasmic proteins are reduced to free sulfhydryl groups, greatly decreasing their stability. The upregulated dsbB encodes a disulfide bond-\u00adforming protein with predicted periplasmic localization, which could ameliorate these effects. 28 Figure 2-\u00ad7. Iron acquisition model. Fe(III): Outside of the cell Fe(III) binds to the siderophore pyoverdine and this complex enters the periplasm via the TonB-\u00addependent outer membrane transporter FpvA (7). The reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) frees the iron from pyoverdine. A pyoverdine efflux pump, OmpQ, recycles free pyoverdine by transporting it out of the cell (68). The Fe(II) then enters the cytoplasm through an unidentified ABC transporter. Upon entering the cytoplasm, Fe(II) binds Fur, which subsequently represses multiple iron acquisition and iron storage genes (69). Fe(II): Fe(II) enters the periplasm through a nonspecific porin in the outer membrane. While in the periplasm, Fe(II) activates the histidine response regulator BqsR. BqsR then goes on to induce its regulon. Fe(II) enters the cytoplasm through the ferrous iron transporter FeoB (26). Once in the cytoplasm, Fe(II) binds Fur, which results in the repression of iron acquisition genes. Solid arrows indicate known pathways, dashed arrows indicate putative pathways, and three lines indicate binding. Pvd, pyoverdine; OM, outer membrane; CM, cytoplasmic membrane. One clear result is that the PA14_04180 gene is highly upregulated by BqsR/BqsS. Bioinformatic predictions suggest it is periplasmically localized and has a bacterial oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-\u00adbinding domain (OB-\u00adfold). The distinguishing feature of bacterial OB-\u00adfold proteins compared to other OB-\u00adfold proteins is that the bacterial ligand-\u00adbinding domain binds cationic ligands rather than nucleotides (70). 29 Proteins with such domains can serve a variety of functions and have been implicated in bacterial pathogenesis (71). In fact, the Fe(III)-\u00adbinding PmrA/PmrB regulates a similar periplasmic OB-\u00adfold protein (OmdA) resistance to polymyxin B, a cationic antimicrobial peptide (72). Whether PA14_04180 confers a similar resistance in Pseudomonas species is currently unknown. The identification of an extracellular Fe(II)-\u00adsensing system that is specific for Fe(II), can distinguish between Fe(II) and Fe(III), and is insensitive to other dipositive ions opens up several avenues for future research. It reminds us that the concentration of Fe(II) can be sufficiently high in some habitats for bacteria to have evolved specific mechanisms to sense it. What their transcriptional response is and how it helps them adapt to these conditions remain to be determined. Once the molecular basis of Fe(II) specificity is understood, it may be possible to identify other proteins that have a similar specificity for Fe(II). Finally, monitoring the transcription of genes regulated by BqsR/BqsS may provide an opportunity to indirectly gauge whether P. aeruginosa is experiencing Fe(III) or Fe(II) in its environment. For example, knowing the iron oxidation state in CF sputum or biofilm microenvironments would inform the proper administration of antimicrobial therapies targeting iron uptake. Materials and Methods Bacterial strains and growth conditions. Bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Table 2-\u00ad3. Stationary-\u00adphase cultures of P. aeruginosa strains were grown aerobically at 37\u00b0C in 3 g/liter Bacto tryptic soy broth containing 100 mM KNO3. The overnight cultures were diluted to an optical density at 500 nm (OD500) of 0.01 in minimal metal medium 30 (MMM). MMM consists of 0.3 g/liter Bacto-\u00adtryptic soy broth, 50 mM glutamate, 1% KNO3, and 50 mM MOPS (morpholinepropanesulfonic acid); the pH was adjusted to 7.0 with NaOH, and the medium was treated with 1% (wt/vol) Amberlite chelating resin (Sigma) for 1 h and filtered into acid-\u00adwashed medium bottles prior to autoclaving. After autoclaving, MMM was immediately sparged to maintain anaerobic conditions and brought into a vinyl anaerobic chamber containing a 5% hydrogen, 15% carbon dioxide, and 80% nitrogen gas mixture (Coy Laboratory Products). Ten milliliters of medium was added to 25-\u00adml anaerobic Balch tubes, which were acid-\u00adwashed in 1 M HCl to remove residual metals. Unless otherwise specified, inoculations were performed anaerobically in the anaerobic chamber with the previously stated gas mixture and incubated and shaken at 37\u00b0C. Spectrophotometric measurements were performed on a Beckman Spec20 unless otherwise specified. TABLE 2-\u00ad3.

The bqsR unmarked deletion was created using a pMQ30-\u00adbased construct, which was made by applying the Saccharomyces cerevisiae-\u00adbased molecular tool kit (41) (Table 2-\u00ad3). This procedure takes advantage of yeast homologous recombination to combine the vector with PCR-\u00adamplified regions upstream and downstream from the gene of interest. The 5 region (1 kb in length) of the sequence flanking bqsR was amplified using primers JW1_F and JW1_R, and the 3 region (1 kb in length) of the sequence flanking bqsR was amplified using primers JW2_F and JW2_R (Table 2-\u00ad4). Both primer pairs contained regions that were homologous to each other, and the 5 ends of the JW1_F and the JW2_R primers contained 40-\u00adbp bqsR clean AGGTGATCGAGACCCGCCGTGTTCGTCGGCCAGGGGAACG bqsR clean clean GAAGAACTGTTAAGCCCTGGCCCGCTGGATCGACCTCAT Construction of bqsS clean deletion dbqsS 3 ATGAGGTCGATCCAGCGGGCCAGGGCTTAACAGTTCTTC Construction of bqsS clean deletion dbqsS plasmid linearized with EcoRI and BamHI as well as with the upstream and downstream PCR fragments; recombinant plasmids were generated by yeast homologous recombination (41). Recombinants were selected on synthetic defined medium lacking uracil (SDUra). Plasmids were liberated from uracil-\u00adauxotrophic yeast using the QIAprep Spin miniprep kit (Qiagen) yeast protocol and electroporated coli DH5. Plasmids obtained from DH5 were electroporated into E. coli BW29427. The deletion plasmid was mobilized from BW29427 biparental PA14 single recombinants (merodiploid containing the intact bqsR gene and a deleted gene) were 34 selected on LB agar containing 100 g/ml gentamicin. These colonies were then grown in the absence of selection to resolve merodiploids. Potential bqsR deletion mutants (resolved merodiploids) were identified by selecting for colonies that grew in the presence of 10% sucrose. Strains with properties of double recombination were further analyzed by PCR and sequenced to verify bqsR deletion (bqsR). The above protocol was performed for the bqsS deletion (bqsS), substituting primers dbqsS 1 JW2_F and JW2_R (see Table 2-\u00ad4 for primer sequences). Because the reading frames in the bqs operon overlap, we were careful to construct our deletions in this region so as to both render them nonpolar and preserve the integrity of the remaining genes in the operon. Analysis of global gene expression using P. aeruginosa Affymetrix GeneChips. The GeneChip P. aeruginosa genome array (Affymetrix) contains probe sets for more than 5,500 genes from P. aeruginosa PAO1 and 117 additional genes from strains other than PAO1. Due to the strong similarity between strains PAO1 and PA14, the Affymetrix array has been used for gene expression analysis of both strains (43-\u00ad45). P. aeruginosa PA14 was grown in anaerobic MMM as described in \"Bacterial strains and growth conditions.\" The cultures were grown anaerobically at 37\u00b0C until they reached exponential phase (OD500 of 0.3), at which time they were removed from the incubator and were taken into the anaerobic chamber containing a gas mixture of 5% H2 and 95% N2 (Coy Laboratory Products). Water, 100 M FeCl3, or 100 M FeCl2 was added to the cultures. Iron concentrations were calculated by weight, assuming 100% purity of Fe(III) and Fe(II) 35 stocks. The cultures were vortexed every 5 min over a 30-\u00admin period, after which 5 ml of culture was removed and mixed with 10 ml of bacterial RNAprotect (Qiagen). The cultures were incubated for 5 min at room temperature before cells were pelleted (10 min, 5,000 \u00d7 g). DNA-\u00adfree RNA was isolated from the cell pellet using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) that includes on-\u00adcolumn DNase treatment. The preparation of the cDNA, as well as the processing of the P. aeruginosa GeneChip arrays, was performed by the BioMicro Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) using an Affymetrix fluidics station. GeneChip arrays were performed in biological triplicate. Signal intensities were background corrected, normalized, and summarized using the robust multiarray averaging (RMA) method in the Bioconductor package affy (46-\u00ad48). Linear models for each gene were fit using the program limma, and moderated t statistics were calculated with limma's empirical Bayes approach (49). P values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-\u00adHochberg method to control the false-\u00addiscovery rate (50); these adjusted values are referred to as q values. A threshold q value of 0.01 was used to identify differentially expressed genes, resulting in a false-\u00addiscovery rate of 1% among genes called significant. Verification of GeneChip data was performed with quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-\u00adPCR). Validating iron concentrations. Fe(II) readily oxidizes in the presence of trace levels of oxygen. Different Fe(II) salts have different stabilities in water. For most experiments, the Fe(II) source was ferrous chloride; it was used because the anion, chloride, was expected to have little effect on the metabolism of PA14. However, this form is less 36 stable in water than ferrous ammonium sulfate. To be certain of the total iron concentration and to distinguish between Fe(II) and Fe(III), the ferrozine assay (51) was used. Ferrozine to Fe(II) and provides a colorimetric readout of Fe(II) concentration compared to that of a standard. Ferrous ammonium sulfate in acid was used as a standard because it is the most stable form of Fe(II) and, under acidic conditions, all the iron is expected to remain in the Fe(II) state. Iron-\u00adbound ferrozine was measured at 562 nm. Total iron concentration was determined by reducing the sample with hydroxylamine hydrochloride to convert all Fe(III) to Fe(II). Fe(II) shock experiments. Genes found to be strongly induced in the array experiment were examined using qRT-\u00adPCR (primers are listed in Table 2-\u00ad4). P. aeruginosa strains listed in Table 2-\u00ad3 were grown anaerobically in 10-\u00adml cultures in triplicate as described in \"Bacterial strains and growth conditions.\" The Fe(II) shock was performed in the anaerobic chamber after the cultures grown in MMM reached early exponential phase. Five-\u00admilliliter samples of each culture were removed immediately before the Fe(II) shock and mixed with 2 volumes of bacterial RNAprotect (Qiagen), incubated for 5 min at room temperature, and centrifuged for 10 min at 5,000 \u00d7 g. These served as the Fe-\u00adfree control. A 50 M concentration of Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 was added to the cultures, mixed, and incubated for 30 min. After the 30-\u00admin shock, the remaining 5-\u00adml culture was immediately added to 10 ml RNAprotect, incubated for 5 min at room temperature, and centrifuged for 10 min at 5,000 \u00d7 g. The pellets were stored at 80\u00b0C until RNA isolation, and qRT-\u00adPCR analysis were performed. 37 Anaerobic metal shock experiments. PA14 was grown in MMM to early exponential phase and treated as described in \"Fe(II) shock experiments,\" substituting Fe(III) and various dipositive cations for Fe(II). The metals tested were 100 M Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 [containing 100 M Fe(II), as determined by weight and the ferrozine assay], 100 M FeCl3, 5 mM CaCl2, 100 M MnCl2, 10 mM MgCl2, 100 M ZnCl2, and 100 M CuCl2. The concentrations of calcium and magnesium were selected to approximate physiologically relevant concentrations (52). Aerobic metal shock experiments. PA14 was grown in MMM aerobically to early exponential phase and shocked with the metal concentrations given above. The Fe(II) concentration in the Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 was determined by the ferrozine assay before and after the aerobic shock to determine if any iron remained in the Fe(II) state after the 30-\u00admin exposure to oxygen. The initial Fe(II) concentration was 100 M, and the concentration after the 30-\u00admin shock was 4.9 M. Fe(II) titration. Triplicate samples of ml MMM in 125-\u00adml acid-\u00adwashed serum vials were inoculated from cultures grown as described in \"Bacterial stains and growth conditions\" and sealed. When the cells reached early exponential phase, the Fe(II) shock was performed. Five milliliters of culture was treated with RNAprotect before the iron shock and used as the no-\u00adiron control. Subsequently, 5 ml of culture was added to tubes containing iron and incubated for 30 min. The Fe(II) concentrations assayed were 6 M, 38 19 M, 31.6 M, 38 M, 51 M, and 63 M (10 M, 30 M, 50 M, 60 M, 80 M, and 100 M FeCl2 by weight, respectively). After the shock, the cultures were added to 10 ml RNAprotect for RNA stabilization. RNA isolation and qRT-\u00adPCR analysis. Total RNA was extracted from the cell pellet using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen), including the optional DNase treatment step, according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was generated using the extracted RNA as a template for an iScript (Bio-\u00adRad) random-\u00adprimed reverse transcriptase reaction by following the manufacturer's protocol. The cDNA was used as a template for quantitative PCR (Real Time 7500 PCR machine; Applied Biosystems) using SYBR green with the ROX detection system (Bio-\u00adRad). Samples were assayed in biological triplicate. The threshold cycle (CT) values of recA and clpX were used as endogenous controls (45). Fold changes were calculated using the CT method. Briefly, all samples were normalized to each other by subtracting the CT value for the control gene recA in the shock condition from the value in the control condition (CT recA). This value was then converted from the log2 using the following formula, which accounts for machine error: a = 2CT recA. The change in the genes of interest was calculated by subtracting the CT value of the gene in the shock condition from the CT value for the gene in the control condition (CT gene). This value was then converted from the log2 using the following formula: b = 2CT gene. The final relative fold change is calculated by the following formula: fold change = b/a. To ensure recA was constant under all conditions tested, the relative fold change for the internal control clpX, whose expression was also 39 expected to remain constant across all our treatments, was calculated as described above. Only those samples with a clpX fold change between 0.5 and 2 were used. Primers (Integrated DNA Technologies) were designed using Primer3, with settings modified for qRT-\u00adPCR primers. Growth, Fe(III) reduction, and bqsR expression experiment. grown aerobically on LB agar plates at 37\u00b0C. Two single colonies were picked, and each was transferred to a fresh tube containing 3 ml of sterilized MOPS minimal medium (50 mM MOPS, 2.2 mM KH2PO4, 43 mM NaCl, 93 mM NH4Cl, 40 mM succinate, 1 mM MgSO4, and 3.6 M FeSO4 \u00b7 7H2O; pH 7.1) and grown overnight at 37\u00b0C. One milliliter of turbid inoculum was then added to 50 ml of sterilized MOPS medium with 500 M FeCl3 \u00b7 6H2O and incubated at 37\u00b0C in triplicate, and a low-\u00adiron control culture was inoculated in MOPS minimal medium without additional Fe(III). At given time points, aliquots were removed from the culture for OD measurements, pyocyanin (a phenazine) concentration measurements, tests to distinguish the iron oxidation state, and qRT-\u00adPCR measurements of the bqs operon. A sample of 500 l was taken for OD measurements, 1 ml was frozen for subsequent high-\u00adperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis, 1.6 ml was taken to distinguish between iron oxidation states, and 2 to 5 ml was taken for RNA isolation. The OD500 was measured in triplicate using the Beckman DU 800 spectrophotometer. Pyocyanin HPLC peaks were identified from experimental samples and quantified with known concentrations of a pyocyanin reference on a Beckman System Gold instrument with an acetonitrile gradient, a Waters Symmetry C18 reverse-\u00adphase column (5-\u00adm 40 particle size; 4.6 by 250 mm), and a 168 diode array detector. The ferrozine assay was used to determine the iron concentrations and the oxidation states of the samples. All iron oxidation state distinctions were conducted in an anaerobic chamber to avoid reoxidation of ferrous ions, and measurements were made with a Biotek Synergy 4 plate reader. Relative fold changes for qRT-\u00adPCR were calculated by comparing samples from MOPS minimal medium plus Fe to samples with the same OD500 from MOPS minimal medium without Fe.

Newman This chapter was adapted from the manuscript: The ferrous iron-\u00adresponsive BqsRS two-\u00adcomponent system activates genes that promote cationic stress tolerance. Kreamer NN, Costa Newman DK. Mbio. Feb 24;6(2). DOI: 10.1128/mbio.02549-\u00ad14. 47 Abstract The physiological resistance of pathogens to antimicrobial treatment is a severe problem in the context of chronic infections. For example, the mucus-\u00adfilled lungs of cystic fibrosis patients are readily colonized by diverse antibiotic-\u00adresistant microorganisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Previously, we showed that bioavailable ferrous iron [Fe(II)] is present in CF sputum at all stages of infection, and constitutes a significant portion of the iron pool at advanced stages of lung function decline (1). P. aeruginosa, a dominant CF pathogen, senses Fe(II) using a two-\u00adcomponent signal transduction system BqsRS, which is transcriptionally active in CF sputum (1, 2). Here, we show that an RExxE motif in BqsS is required for BqsRS activation. Once Fe(II) is sensed, BqsR binds a tandem repeat DNA sequence, activating transcription. The BqsR regulon\u2014defined through iterative bioinformatic predictions and experimental validation\u2014includes several genes whose products are known to drive antibiotic resistance to aminoglycosides and polymyxins. Among them are genes encoding predicted determinants of polyamine transport and biosynthesis. Compared to the wild type, bqsS and bqsR deletion mutants are sensitive to high levels of Fe(II), produce less spermidine in high Fe(II), and are more sensitive to tobramycin and polymyxin B but not arsenate, chromate, thus mediates a physiological response to Fe(II) that guards the cell against positively charged molecules, but not negatively-\u00adcharged stressors. These results suggest Fe(II) is an important environmental signal that, via BqsRS, bolsters tolerance of a variety of cationic stressors, including clinically important antimicrobial agents. 48 Significance Statement Clearing chronic infections is challenging due to the physiological resistance of opportunistic pathogens to antibiotics. Effective treatments are hindered by a lack of understanding of how these organisms survive in situ. Fe(II) is typically present at micromolar levels in soils and sedimentary habitats, as well as in CF sputum. All P. aeruginosa strains possess a two-\u00adcomponent system, BqsRS, that specifically senses extracellular Fe(II) at low micromolar concentrations. Our work shows that BqsRS protects the cell against cationic perturbations to the cell envelope as well as low pH and Eh, conditions under which Fe2+ is stable. Fe(II) can thus be understood as a proxy for a broader environmental state; the cellular response to its detection may help rationalize the resistance of P. aeruginosa to clinically-\u00adimportant cationic antibiotics. This finding demonstrates the importance of considering environmental chemistry when exploring mechanisms of microbial survival in habitats that include the human body. Introduction Iron is an essential trace element for most life forms, occupying key positions in diverse metalloenzymes spanning those involved in energy-\u00adyielding reactions to those critical for cellular defense (3-\u00ad5). In the context of infections, the iron requirement of pathogens has resulted in an evolutionary arms race between host and microbe to sequester and obtain iron, respectively (6). The outcome of the infection depends on who wins this race: for example, iron can promote the formation of biofilms, complex 49 microbial structures that are physiologically resistant to common antibiotics (7-\u00ad9). Iron commonly exists in one of two oxidation states, the oxidized form\u2014ferric iron [Fe(III)]\u2014or the reduced form, ferrous iron [Fe(II)]. Fe(III) predominates in oxic environments, whereas Fe(II) is more stable under hypoxic and/or reducing conditions, with its ionic form (Fe2+) predominating at low pH and reduction potential (Eh) (10). While Fe(III) uptake systems have been the focus of most mechanistically-\u00adoriented studies, growing attention has been placed on the importance of Fe(II) sensing and uptake by pathogens. For example, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the opportunistic pathogen renowned for causing chronic pulmonary infections in CF patients, contains an Fe(II)-\u00adspecific two-\u00adcomponent system, BqsRS (2); different Fe(II)-\u00adresponsive two-\u00adcomponent system, FirRS (11). Recently, we reported average per patient micromolar concentrations of Fe(II) in the mucus-\u00adfilled environment of the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients (1). While the average value of sputum Fe(II) from patients at advanced stages of disease progression was ~40 \u00b5M, considerable variation existed between samples, with many presenting values greater than 100 \u00b5M and some over 200 \u00b5M. Fe(II), not Fe(III), correlated with severe lung function decline, with statistical significance comparable to or greater than other inflammatory indices (12, 13). While the presence of high Fe(II) in the lung may seem paradoxical given it is the site for oxygen exchange into the bloodstream (14), this finding is consistent with several studies that have found the CF mucus environment to contain hypoxic, if not anoxic niches (15, 16). It is perhaps not coincidental that BqsRS-\u00adcontaining 50 members of the Pseudomonadaceae are commonly found in soils and sediments (17), where Fe(II) can reach low micromolar concentrations (18). This environmental reservoir, together with the high Fe(II) concentrations found in sputum, may help contextualize why BqsRS is present in all sequenced strains of P. aeruginosa and why bqsS transcripts were detected in the majority of CF sputum samples tested (1). With Fe(II) as a significant component of the CF lung environment and extracellular Fe(II)-\u00adsensing predicted to be a conserved trait amongst diverse members of the Pseudomonadaceae, it is important to understand how P. aeruginosa responds to Fe(II). Other members of the Pseudomonadaceae (e.g., Azotobacter vinelandii) also contain BqsRS homologs, further motivating studies to better characterize this sensory system. P. aeruginosa has one of the largest regulatory networks of any bacterial species, which allows it to precisely control its response to a variety of environmental stimuli (19). The two-\u00adcomponent system BqsRS was originally discovered as an effector of biofilm dissolution and quorum sensing (20); in a study using zebrafish embryos to screen two-\u00adcomponent systems in P. aeruginosa for phenotypes, BqsS was shown to significantly impact the establishment of infection in the zebrafish host (21). When the trace metal concentration in the medium was controlled by chelation, we showed that BqsRS responds specifically to extracellular Fe(II) at concentrations exceeding 10 mM (2, 20). However, while our previous study identified the bqs operon and a small number of BqsR regulated genes, it did not define the BqsR regulon. 51 Because bqsS transcripts are detectable in CF sputum from patients with chronic P. aeruginosa infections, we wondered whether the BqsRS regulon might control factors that affect its adaptation to the Fe(II)-\u00adreplete environment of CF sputum. We are broadly interested in understanding how P. aeruginosa survives under conditions relevant to the microenvironment of chronic infections, including anoxia and antimicrobial stressors. Here, we sought to gain insight into how BqsS senses Fe(II) and how BqsR controls gene transcription. We identified the BqsRS regulon through bioinformatic, genetic, and biochemical approaches and tested predicted phenotypes. This study expands our knowledge of how P. aeruginosa responds to Fe(II), and suggests a common mechanism helps protect the cell against Fe(II) and other cationic stressors, including certain clinically-\u00adrelevant antibiotics. Results Fe(II) sensing residues Under standard laboratory conditions, the BqsRS system is specifically sensitive to extracellular Fe(II) and not other dipositive cations (2). Multiple bacterial protein prediction programs [TMpred (22) and DAS (23)] predict the sensor kinase BqsS to be a two-\u00adpass transmembrane protein with a periplasmic region containing a RExxE motif (Fig. 3-\u00ad1A). A similar motif is present in a variety of iron-\u00adbinding proteins; a HExxE motif is found in the Fe(III) sensing Salmonella PmrAB two-\u00adcomponent system (24) and a RExxE is present in the yeast Ftr iron permease (25). To determine whether the RExxE motif is 52 involved in Fe(II) sensing, we generated strains with substitutions in these residues in a bqsS mutant background. Alleles with substitutions in the RExxE residues were created and expressed from a chromosomal insertion at the glmS locus comprised of the bqs promoter and the bqsS gene (see Methods). Activation of the BqsS variants in the presence of Fe(II) was measured by following the transcriptional response of bqsP, the first gene in the bqs operon, to 200 \u00b5M Fe(II) (hereafter referred to as \"Fe(II) shock\"). When the glutamates at positions 45 and 48 in BqsS were replaced with alanine (RAxxA) or serine (RSxxS) the transcriptional Fe(II) response was completely abolished. No change was seen in the levels of bqsP in these mutants, as was for the bqsS negative control (Fig. 3-\u00ad1B). The arginine residue at position 44 is also critical: when this amino acid was replaced with alanine (AExxE) the Fe(II) shock response decreased by 98% and when replaced with histidine (HExxE), the response was abolished. None of the site-\u00addirected mutants responded to Fe(III) shock (Fig. 3-\u00ad1C). Fe(II) sensing thus appears to be mediated through the periplasmic RExxE motif in BqsS. 53 Figure 3-\u00ad1. BqsS senses Fe(II) through the RExxE motif. (A) Model of BqsS activation by Fe(II) through the periplasmic RExxE motif and signal transduction to BqsR. This model is based on analogy to similar two-\u00adcomponent systems (54). (B) Point mutations of the RExxE motif in BqsS show a decreased transcriptional response to Fe(II), suggesting that this may be the binding site of ferrous iron. From left to right the bars show the log2 fold change in bqsP (the first the RExxE motif in BqsS show no transcriptional response to Fe(III). From left to right the bars show the log2 fold change in bqsP (the first binding site Having identified some of the key BqsS residues responsible for Fe(II) sensing, we sought to elucidate the BqsR DNA binding sequence. Previously, we performed a microarray experiment to determine whether there were genes uniquely upregulated in response to Fe(II) rather than Fe(III) or other dipositive cations (2). Not only did this experiment reveal the existence of the BqsRS system, it also alluded to genes that might 54 be under its control. By inputting the 500 base pair region upstream from the five most upregulated genes in the microarray (2) into the motif search program MEME (26), we generated putative consensus DNA binding motifs. BqsR belongs to the OmpR-\u00adlike class of two-\u00adcomponent systems, the most common type (27), in which the response regulator contains a phosphoreceiver domain and an effector domain. Members of this class of response regulators, such as OmpR and PhoP, are known to bind tandem repeat DNA sequences (28, 29). Accordingly, we reasoned that the most likely predicted BqsR DNA motif consisted of a 5 bp tandem repeat with 6 intervening nucleotides (Fig. 3-\u00ad2A); we went on to test this biochemically and through iterative bioinformatic and transcriptional measurements. 55 Figure 3-\u00ad2. A) Predicted sequence used to find TTAAG(N)6TTAAG used in the gel shift assays. B) Native bqs sequence shows the exact sequence in front of the bqs operon shows a gel shift when incubated with BqsR. C) Fur box in tonB is the negative control showing no non-\u00adspecific DNA binding for BqsR. D) Bqs in the TonB context shows the perfect BqsR tandem repeat exchanging the bqs flanking regions with the flanking 20 bp from tonB and the gel shift shows that the BqsR sequence is sufficient to induce the gel shift. Gel shift assays proved BqsR binds specifically to the MEME-\u00adpredicted tandem repeat DNA sequence. Because the bqs operon is autoregulated (2), we incubated purified BqsR with a synthetic 60 bp DNA sequence from the bqs promoter region containing the tandem repeat. The native sequence contains one nucleotide substitution in the perfect tandem repeat consensus DNA sequence. Both the perfect tandem repeat (Fig. 3-\u00ad3A) and the native tandem repeat (Fig. 3-\u00ad2B) showed decreased mobility with increasing protein concentrations on a native polyacrylamide gel, indicating BqsR-\u00adbound DNA. To ensure this was a sequence specific shift, BqsR was incubated with the 56 bp sequence in the tonB promoter containing a Fur box (a palindromic sequence with no homology to the predicted BqsR box) with flanking 20 bp DNA regions. No shift was observed for the tonB sequence with the same concentrations of BqsR (Fig. 3-\u00ad2C). To determine whether the BqsR box was sufficient to bind BqsR, we placed the bqs tandem repeat into a tonB context by exchanging the flanking bqs 20 bp regions for those flanking the Fur box from the tonB promoter (Fig. 3-\u00ad2D). This hybrid sequence also showed a similar BqsR concentration dependent decrease in mobility, signifying the bqs tandem repeat is sufficient for BqsR binding. As a final control, we randomized the bqs tandem repeat sequence while preserving its GC content (Fig. 3-\u00ad3A); there was no shift with increasing 56 BqsR concentration, demonstrating that the 5 bp bqs tandem repeat is necessary and sufficient for BqsR binding. While these experiments were performed without chemically phosphorylating BqsR (acetyl phosphate failed to generate stable phosphorylated BqsR), we would expect phosphorylated BqsR would increase its affinity for DNA containing the BqsR box, as has been observed for other response regulators (30). Figure 3-\u00ad3. BqsR binds to a bioinformatically predicted tandem repeat that overlaps with the RNA polymerase binding site and appears to be activated by phosphorylation. (A) Gel shift assays demonstrate that BqsR binds to the specific tandem repeat TTAAG(N)6TTAAG, and within the same flanking DNA sequence does not bind to a randomized tandem repeat with the same binding energy. (B) By determining the transcription start site of three genes, bqsP, PA14_04180, and PA14_04270, that are upregulated to different degrees by cRACE, it is evident that the BqsR binding site overlaps with the RNA polymerase -\u00ad35 binding site. The box shaded dark grey highlights the translation start site; the light grey box indicates the -\u00ad10 and -\u00ad35 RNA polymerase binding sites; the white box with grey letters shows the BqsR binding sites. (C) In the bqsR background, bqsR, bqsR-\u00adD51E (a phophomimic), or bqsR-\u00adD51A (cannot be were inserted into the glmS locus under a constitutively active promoter. Cells were grown in 100 \u00b5M Fe(II) and 1 \u00b5M Fe(II) and transcription of bqsP was measured by qRT-\u00adPCR. The light gray bar shows native bqsR activation by comparing expression between 100 \u00b5M Fe(II) and 1 \u00b5M Fe(II). The dark gray bar shows expression of bqsP in bqsR-\u00adD51E in 1 \u00b5M Fe(II) to 57 native bqsR grown in 1 \u00b5M Fe(II). The white bar compares expression of bqsP in bqsR-\u00adD51A in 100 \u00b5M Fe(II) to native in 1 \u00b5M Fe(II). Because the D51E phosphomimic mutant is similar to WT activation and D51A shows no upregulation, the phosphorylated form of BqsR likely binds DNA and activates transcription. Promoter architecture and BqsR activation mechanism To obtain a more finely resolved picture of how BqsR interacts with promoter regions\u2014specifically, to identify where BqsR binds with respect to the RNA polymerase binding site\u2014we performed Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (cRACE) on three representative BqsR-\u00adregulated genes (PA14_04180, bqsS and PA14_04270) with a range of induced expression levels from high to low (Fig. 3-\u00ad3B). Using the transcription start sites identified by cRACE, we could identify the -\u00ad10 and -\u00ad35 RNA polymerase binding sites. For both PA14_04180 and the bqs promoter, the -\u00ad35 RNA polymerase binding site overlaps with one of the BqsR tandem repeat sites. PA14_04270 contains two transcription start sites, of which the most upstream site's -\u00ad35 position also overlaps with the BqsR binding site. Because the BqsR DNA binding site overlaps with the RNA polymerase binding site, we wondered whether BqsR acts as a classical transcriptional activator. Previously, it has been shown that transcription factor binding sites that overlap with the -\u00ad35 RNA polymerase sigma binding site can activate transcription by helping recruit RNA polymerase to the promoter (31). To test whether BqsR serves as an activator in vivo, we replaced the conserved phospho-\u00adacceptor aspartate with a glutamate to mimic a constitutively phosphorylated response regulator, or we changed the aspartate to an 58 alanine to prevent the response regulator from being phosphorylated; this experimental design assumes functional conservation between BqsR and other two-\u00adcomponent regulators at this residue (32-\u00ad34). bqsR alleles containing one of these mutations were placed under the control of a constitutive weak promoter at a neutral site (35), in the bqsR mutant background. The expression level of a BqsRS-\u00adregulated gene (bqsP) in the strain carrying the phosphomimic mutant should indicate the function of the activated BqsR, and its expression level in the non-\u00adphosphorylatable mutant should indicate the function of the unphosphorylated form. The D51E mutant is constitutively activated, and when grown in 1 \u00b5M Fe(II) shows similar transcript levels to WT cells grown in 100 \u00b5M Fe(II); the D51A mutant does not enhance bqsP expression under any condition (Fig. 3-\u00ad3C). This suggests that BqsR is an activator when phosphorylated. Consistent with this interpretation, the bqsR strain does not induce the BqsR regulon. Together, these in vivo data suggest that BqsRS is a classical two-\u00adcomponent system, with the Fe(II) signal presumably causing BqsS to phosphorylate BqsR, and phosphorylated BqsR binding DNA to activate a transcriptional response; this remains to be proven biochemically. Predicted BqsR regulon Having validated the predicted BqsR binding motif, we searched the genome to identify candidate BqsR-\u00adregulated genes using two strategies. First, we used a regular expression approach. We selected the most common variants of the bqs tandem repeat consensus sequences by eye from our initial position weight matrix (PWM) (Fig. 3-\u00ad2). A 59 representative regular expression sequence was TTAMG(N)4-\u00ad8TTAMG, which assumed no preference for the nucleotides between the tandem repeat sequences (Fig. 3-\u00ad4A). We then searched the intergenic regions of the PA14 genome for matches to these regular expressions using the Motif Search tool available on the Pseudomonas Genome Database (36). The final PWM (Fig. 3-\u00ad4B) was reached through multiple rounds of generating new lists of potential BqsR regulated genes, verifying new members of the regulon by q-\u00adreverse transcriptase-\u00adPCR (qRT-\u00adPCR) and adding the upstream regions to the MEME input to generate a refined PWM. This PWM identified approximately 75 genes, while the regular expression approach identified 62 gene targets. Genes identified through both methods were annotated using information from a variety of databases (Dataset S1) and classified by DAVID (37) (Table 3-\u00ad1). A subset of these were tested by qRT-\u00adPCR if they met one of three criteria: 1) found in both the regular expression approach and the PWM-\u00adbased approach (Fig. 3-\u00ad4C); 2) present in a cluster of genes with similar function (Table 3-\u00ad1); or 3) had an E-\u00advalue of less than 50 from the PWM approach (Dataset S1). This high E-\u00advalue was chosen to obtain the broadest possible set of putative BqsR-\u00adregulated genes. 60 Figure 3-\u00ad4. Bioinformatic predictions of the BqsR regulon.

Broad predicted functions of genes identified by either regular expression or the PWM approach based on homology of their gene products to known proteins and categorized by DAVID. Some genes fit into two categories. Function # Genes % Annotation protease/hydrolase activity 15 8.6 61 transposition, DNA metabolic process 3 1.7 (poly)amine metabolism 4 2.3 metal binding/hydrolase 14 8.0 protein complex assembly 3 1.7 outer membrane/envelope 6 3.4 metabolism/regulation 50 28.7 RNA metabolic process 3 1.7 signal transducer/two-\u00adcomponent system 5 2.9 membrane/transport 18 10.3 redox/cofactor binding 11 6.3 ATPase/nucleotide-\u00adbinding 6 3.4 transferase activity 7 4.0 intracellular 3 1.7 23S RNA 4 2.3 hypothetical 22 12.6 All of the previously identified Fe(II)-\u00adresponsive genes (2) showed BqsR-\u00addependent upregulation with Fe(II) shock when tested by qRT-\u00adPCR. While some of these predicted genes appeared in our earlier microarray study (2), that study was performed only in the WT in exponential phase and the transcriptional response observed aggregated all direct and indirect effects of Fe(II) shock, not only those specific to BqsR. 5 out of 12 newly predicted genes showed a BqsR-\u00addependent Fe(II) shock response (Fig. 3-\u00ad4D) in early exponential phase. Several of these genes have known or predicted functions involving cell stress resistance, polyamine biosynthesis/transport, or polymyxin resistance in P. aeruginosa strains. For example, oprH, a small outer membrane porin, is part of an operon containing the two-\u00adcomponent system phoPQ, and all three genes are linked to polymyxin resistance (38). oprH is thought to stabilize the outer membrane, while phoPQ is upregulated by phosphate and Mg2+ limitation and contributes to resistance to polymyxins among other cationic antimicrobials (38, 39). arnB is the first gene of the 62 operon arnBCADTEF, which together synthesize an aminoarabinose derivative covalently attached to lipid A, preventing electrostatic interaction of the polymyxin amine groups with the phosphates in the LPS (40). PA14_04220-\u00adPA14_04250 forms an operon with similar structure and functional homology to the potABCD operon, a known spermidine/putrescine transporter (41). Finally, PA14_63110 is in an operon with PA14_63120, PA14_63130, and confirmed 3-\u00ad5). PA14_63110 and PA14_63120 are predicted spermidine synthesis genes (42) and pmrAB, while unresponsive to Fe(III) in P. aeruginosa (unlike Salmonella typhimurium) (43), has been shown to regulate genes that partially overlap the phoPQ regulon (44). PmrAB has also been shown to be involved in polymyxin resistance (44). Figure 3-\u00ad5. RT-\u00adPCR showing that pmrA, and pmrB are in an operon. From top to bottom, the gel shows PCR products spanning the 63 junctions between genes in cDNA, PCR products with genomic DNA, no bands observed for the mRNA, and no template. RNA-\u00adSeq Because our qRT-\u00adPCR analysis and previous microarray study (2) were limited in scope (e.g., focused on particular genes under a single condition), we performed an RNA-\u00adSeq experiment to identify a broader set of BqsR-\u00adregulated genes and validate our bioinformatics predictions. For this experiment, we compared WT to bqsR grown anaerobically in Fe-\u00adlimited conditions until deep stationary phase, when quorum sensing is active [validated by measuring rhamnolipid production (45) and Appendix A] and subsequently shocked with 200 \u00b5M Fe(II). We expected that some genes under this condition might be co-\u00adregulated by quorum sensing regulators, which we would have missed in our earlier experiments. We analyzed the RNAseq data in multiple ways: by calculating the reads per kilobase per million reads mapped (RPKM) for each gene and sRNA in the genome (Dataset S2), and by calculating this value for each predicted transcription unit as defined by Wurtzel et. al (46) (Dataset S3). Genes or transcriptional units that showed 2-\u00adfold higher expression in the WT strain compared to the mutant strain under the iron shock condition, and had an FDR value less than 0.01 (47), were considered to be differentially expressed in a BqsR-\u00addependent manner. The regular expression approach predicted 10/29 of the transcriptional units upregulated by BqsR in the RNA-\u00adSeq data (Fig. 3-\u00ad4A) and the PWM predicted 11/29 (Fig. 3-\u00ad4B), together accounting for 38% of the transcriptional units upregulated by BqsR in the 64 RNA-\u00adSeq data. The functional annotation tool of the DAVID suite identified several categories among the genes upregulated in our RNA-\u00adSeq data (4%), and redox (4%). We note that growth conditions impact the expression of the BqsR regulon. For example, qRT-\u00adPCR data showed that PA14_04250 has BqsR-\u00addependent upregulation in early exponential phase but not in deep stationary phase; in contrast, napE is expressed in deep stationary but not in early exponential phase. Thus, the list of BqsR-\u00adregulated genes presented in Dataset S2 and S3 likely represents a subset of the genes under its control. 65 Figure 3-\u00ad6. Physiological defects in deletion mutants in BqsRS both in growth deficiencies and increased antibiotic susceptibility. For growth in MOMM shown in part A and B, WT are diamonds, bqsR are squares, and bqsS are triangles. (A) At 5 \u00b5M Fe(II) all strains grow like WT. At 100 \u00b5M Fe(II), a condition where BqsRS is normally active, the deletion mutants show a deficiency in growth in both lag phase and final density. (B) When 190 \u00b5M ferrozine, which chelates 2 ferrozine:1 \u00b5M Fe(II), leaving ~5 \u00b5M free Fe, the growth defect is abolished. Exogenous addition of 10 mM spermidine can also rescue of the growth defect. (C) BqsR upregulates genes in both spermidine biosynthesis and transport. Spermidine production was measured by HPLC and reported in molecules spermidine/OD500. The bars show spermidine production from left to right WT, bqsR, bqsS, and bqsRS in 5 \u00b5M Fe(II). In high Fe(II) the deletion mutants produce significantly less spermidine. (D) Polymyxin B kill curves show % survival of cells grown in 75 \u00b5M Fe(II) treated with polymyxin B over 2 hours. bqsR shown in light gray survived an order of magnitude less than WT is shown in dark gray. (E) The structure of compounds used in this study at pH 7.2. Cationic structures include spermidine, the general polymyxin structure, and tobramycin aminoglycoside). and response to the BqsR regulon is consistently upregulated upon Fe(II) exposure, this allowed us to identify phenotypes potentially under BqsRS control. Our first prediction was that BqsRS promotes cell tolerance of high Fe(II) levels. To test this, we compared the growth of WT, bqsR, and bqsS strains in minimal medium under conditions in which BqsRS is inactive [5 \u00b5M Fe(II)] is active [100 \u00b5M Fe(II)] (2). In the presence of low iron [5 \u00b5M Fe(II)], the strains grew similarly, whereas at [100 \u00b5M Fe(II), the bqsR, and bqsS mutants compared to WT (Fig. 3-\u00ad6A). Complementation restored WT growth (Fig. 3-\u00ad7A). The growth defect was also relieved by the addition of ferrozine, a Fe(II) chelator (Fig. 3-\u00ad6B). 66 Figure 3-\u00ad7. A) Chromosomal complements for deletion strains in 100 \u00b5M Fe(II) shows bqsR::bqsR (squares) and bqsS::bqsS (triangles) have the same growth phenotype as WT. B) Growth curves performed in transposon mutants of BqsR-\u00adresponsive genes and AA +200 \u00b5M Fe(II). WT is plotted in dark blue in all graphs and all transposon mutants show a moderate growth defect. The top graph shows WT and PA14_63110 transposon mutant, the middle graph plots WT and the PA14_63120 mutant, and the bottom graph shows WT and the pmrA mutant. C) A growth curve showing 5 mM spermidine partially rescues bqsR (squares) and bqsS (triangles) growth deficiency in 100 \u00b5M Fe(II) when compared to WT (diamonds). A striking aspect of the BqsR regulon is that many of its genes are predicted to play a role in polyamine biosynthesis and transport. For instance, decarboxylation of S-\u00adadenosylmethionine is predicted to be catalyzed by PA14_63110, and, subsequently, an amine group from S-\u00adadenosyl-\u00adL-\u00admethioninamine is transferred to putrescine by 67 PA14_63120 to form Transposon of this operon, PA14_63110, PA14_63120, and pmrA, also show a moderate growth defect in high Fe(II) (see Fig. 3-\u00ad7B). As mentioned previously, PA14_04220-\u00adPA14_04250 are predicted to encode a spermidine/putrescine-\u00adspecific transporter (48) and the operon PA14_04190 -PA14_04210 (induced in the RNA-\u00adSeq experiment) is also predicted by COG (49) to encode a polyamine transporter. Given that PA14_63110-\u00ad63120 homologues in P. aeruginosa PAO1 have been shown to promote outer membrane stability (50), we hypothesized that spermidine might protect the cell from anaerobic Fe(II) toxicity by electrostatically repelling the ferrous ion from the cell surface and intracellular components. Consistent with this hypothesis, the mutants' growth defect was partially rescued by exogenous addition of 5 mM spermidine (Fig. 3-\u00ad7C) and fully rescued by 10 mM spermidine (Fig. 3-\u00ad6B). Whether other polyamines can provide similar protection remains to be determined. Because exogenous spermidine protected the mutants, we reasoned that the bqsR/S deletion mutants were deficient in spermidine production in the presence of high Fe(II). HPLC analysis of polyamine extracts taken from cell lysate showed that the mutants produced approximately 50-\u00ad66% as much spermidine as the WT when grown in the presence of 75 \u00b5M Fe(II) (Fig. 3-\u00ad6C), whereas no significant difference in spermidine production was observed between the WT and the bqsR, bqsS, and bqsRS strains in 5 \u00b5M Fe(II). Interestingly, for the WT, the total amount of spermidine in the culture did not increase from the 5 \u00b5M to the 75 \u00b5M Fe(II) growth condition. 68 Previous studies have indicated that spermidine can protect P. aeruginosa from several classes of cationic antimicrobials (42, 50). Additionally, BqsR-\u00adupregulated genes such as pmrAB, arnB, oprH and phoPQ have been demonstrated to be involved in polymyxin resistance (19, 44). Accordingly, we tested susceptibility to polymyxin B by comparing killing curves of WT and bqsR grown in 75 \u00b5M Fe(II) to late exponential phase (Fig. 3-\u00ad6D). Typically polymyxin survival assays are performed in aerobic conditions in rich medium, whereas our assays were performed anaerobically in minimal medium where the doubling time is 4-\u00ad10 times longer. This accounts for the increased time scale in the killing curve. After an hour of incubation at 37 oC with 25 \u00b5g/ml polymyxin B, differences in WT and bqsR survival were observed. After two hours, 3.7% of WT survived, whereas only 0.14% of bqsR survived. When complemented, the bqsR strain behaved like the WT. Additionally, we observed a distinct morphological difference between WT and bqsR colonies. The bqsR colonies treated with polymyxin B varied greatly in size and several satellite colonies could be seen (Fig. 3-\u00ad8A). We therefore counted the total number of colonies, but kept track of the percentage of large and small. After 24 hours of incubation, half of the bqsR colonies visible after 48 hours were unobservable; counting solely colonies larger than a pinprick at this time point, we observed 0.07% survival for bqsR compared to 3.0% survival in WT (Fig. 3-\u00ad8B). Figure 4D shows survival calculated from final cell counts after 48 hours of incubation. bqsR water-\u00adtreated control and WT polymyxin B-\u00adtreated cells showed consistent colony morphology after 24 hours of incubation. 69 Figure 3-\u00ad8. A) After 48 hours of growth the colonies were visible as shown; marked colonies on these images correspond to colonies visible after 24 hours. The marked colonies after 48 hours are the \"large\" colonies, and the unmarked colonies are the \"small\" colonies. For the bqsR 10-\u00ad3 dilution, none of the colonies were present at 24 hour, so all the colonies seen here were counted as small colonies. B) A 25 \u00b5g/ml polymyxin B anaerobic kill curve in 75 \u00b5M Fe(II) that excludes the small colony variants observed in bqsR (light gray) percent survival compared to the percent survival of WT (dark gray). C) When ferrozine or spermidine was added, the high Fe(II) tobramycin MIC was restored to WT levels in the mutant. To test the hypothesis that BqsRS provides specific protection against diverse cationic stressors when activated by Fe(II), we performed MIC90 assays of both cationic and anionic stressors (Table 3-\u00ad2). Due to differences in growth rate and lag phase between WT and bqsR in 75 \u00b5M Fe(II), we analyzed the MIC90 experiments at the time point where each strain achieved its maximum optical density in MOMM without the stressor. Under these conditions, there was no MIC difference between WT and bqsR at 70 5 \u00b5M Fe(II) for any of the stressors, as expected, because this concentration is below the activation threshold for BqsRS. Only in the case of Tobramycin, a cationic aminoglycoside (Fig. 4E), a significant difference could be seen at 75 \u00b5M Fe(II) (Table 3-\u00ad2). When treated with Fe) , both bqsR and WT had the same MIC (Fig. 3-\u00ad8C). Negatively charged stressors tested included cefsulodin, 1 negative charge (51), potassium chromate (2 negative charges), and sodium arsenate (1 or 2 negative charges; pKa 7.03). For both chromate and arsenate the MIC was the same for both strains regardless of the [Fe(II)]. For cefsulodin, the MIC differed depending on the [Fe(II)]\u2014a phenomenon that has been observed elsewhere (52)\u2014however, consistent with our hypothesis, BqsR did not affect the sensitivity level. Table 3-\u00ad2. BqsRS guards against cationic but not anionic stressors. MIC assays were performed for the WT and bqsR under anaerobic conditions at two different iron concentrations for tobramycin, cefsulodin, arsenate, and chromate. Numbers in bold highlight where the absence of BqsR makes a difference. Discussion Characterizing the environment that pathogens encounter within the human host can help us understand their behavior. This principle is illustrated by connecting the output of the BqsRS regulatory system to the chemical context of CF sputum. Our research suggests that Fe(II) is an important environmental variable that P. aeruginosa senses through BqsRS, leading to a response that helps it cope not only with elevated Fe(II) concentrations but multiple cationic stressors within the CF lung environment. The ability of BqsRS to specifically respond to Fe(II) is an interesting example of metal selectivity (2). Our results indicate that BqsS recognizes Fe(II) via the RExxE motif in its periplasmic domain, based on analogy to other Fe-\u00adsensing proteins. Although it is unusual for glutamates to prefer Fe(II) to Fe(III), the strongly positive arginine may tune the ligand environment to prefer the less positively charged Fe(II) over Fe(III). While PmrB from Salmonella typhimurium senses Fe(III) than Fe(II) through a similar motif [HExxE], Pseudomonas PmrB does not bind Fe(III) (43). The Pseudomonas PmrB has a 32% amino acid similarity to Salmonella, yet the Fe(III)-\u00adbinding domain in Salmonella strains is missing in P. aeruginosa's PmrB. The Salmonella PmrB requires a distal serine in addition to the HExxE motif for Fe(III) binding (24). This suggests that other, less proximal residues may contribute to Fe(II) recognition by BqsS, particularly as arginine replacement by histidine or alanine is insufficient to convert BqsS to an sensor. HbpS from Streptomyces reticuli contains 8 ExxE Fe(II) binding sites, each with a required adjacent Arg or Lys (single point mutations of the R/K resulted in reduced activity even with 7 72 other intact binding sites) (53). This is consistent with the hypothesis that RExxE may directly bind Fe(II) and the R is a critical part of the Fe(II) binding event. The RExxE motif is just one strategy by which cells sense Fe(II): the FirRS system from H. influenzae utilizes a different motif, DYRED (11). Upon activation, two-\u00adcomponent sensors can act as a kinase or a phosphatase to their cognate response regulators (54). BqsR prefers DNA binding sites that overlap RNA polymerase binding sites, suggesting that BqsR may help recruit RNA polymerase to promoter regions. As one of the few two-\u00adcomponent systems for which the effector is known, BqsRS presents an attractive system for future biochemical studies to validate these predictions and explore the mechanisms of signal transduction. Our primary goal in this study was to predict the biological response to extracellular Fe(II) mediated by BqsRS. Using iterative bioinformatic and experimental approaches to define BqsR regulon, we identified a set of approximately 100 genes potentially under BqsR control. Approximately a third of these genes encode proteins involved in stress tolerance, such as cation-\u00adbinding and transport determinants and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-\u00admodulating proteins. Notably, several experimentally validated genes under BqsR control were annotated as playing a role in polyamine synthesis and transport. Polyamines, including spermidine, are present in all cells and environments (55), and are known to stabilize DNA and RNA, enhance translation and transcription, control porin-\u00admediated transport, and increase the stability of LPS (41). A variety of metals are known to bind LPS (56) and dipositive ions modulate polymyxin sensitivity 73 through interactions with LPS (57). Growing evidence has revealed that Fe(II) can be toxic under anaerobic conditions (58-\u00ad60). Because Fe(II) is thought to enter the cell through outer membrane porins (61, 62), that bqs mutants are particularly sensitive to high levels of Fe(II) yet can be rescued by exogenous spermidine is not surprising. The bqs mutants synthesize less spermidine than the WT, and while over 5 mM exogenous spermidine [a concentration higher than the reported intracellular spermidine concentration of 1-\u00ad3 mM in bacteria (41)] is necessary to fully rescue these mutants, this can be rationalized by the fact that exogenous supplementation is different than endogenous production and that spermidine production is only one of several responses mediated by BqsRS that potentially helps confer resistance to Fe(II). P. aeruginosa possesses two different spermidine synthesis operons: speDE (bacterial in origin) and PA14_63110/PA14_63120 (archaeal in origin). The bacterial S-\u00adadenosylmethonine decarboxylase, speD, requires a dipositive cation (most commonly Mg2+) for activity, whereas the archaeal homolog to PA14_63110 does not require a cation for activity (63). Because other metals may substitute for Mg2+ with reduced enzymatic activity (63, 64), we speculate that high Fe(II) perturbs intracellular metal homeostasis enough to reduce SpeD activity, accounting for the lower spermidine concentrations in the bqsR/S mutants. At high Fe(II), BqsR induction of PA14_63110/PA14_63120 may compensate for SpeD's reduced activity, increasing the concentration of spermidine to homeostatic levels. 74 Given the plausible electrostatic mechanism underpinning polyamine-\u00admediated resistance to Fe(II), we reasoned that BqsRS might also influence resistance to diverse cationic antibiotics but not anionic stressors. Previous studies have established that polyamines can mediate antibiotic resistance to cationic peptides, aminoglycosides, quinolones, and oxidative stress (42, 50, 65, 66). We show that bqs mutants exhibit increased sensitivity to tobramycin compared to the WT when stressed by high Fe(II). In addition to the genes involved in spermidine production and transport, BqsRS upregulates other genes known to be involved in polymyxin resistance, such as arnB and oprH. Moreover, BqsRS activates pmrAB and phoP, which mediate polymyxin resistance in response to other environmental signals (limiting Mg/Ca, or phosphate starvation, respectively (50, 67)). The polymyxin B killing curve demonstrates that bqsR is more sensitive than WT in high Fe(II). Thus, BqsRS may be a master regulator under anoxic, Fe(II)-\u00adreplete conditions, exerting indirect effects via modulating the expression of other regulatory systems. That BqsRS mediates a specific response to cationic stressors in the presence of high Fe(II) is supported by its lack of an effect on resistance to the negatively charged stressors cefsulodin, arsenate, and chromate. Beyond mediating resistance to cationic antibiotics, BqsRS elicits a cellular response that is broadly relevant to survival in an environment where Fe(II) is a dominant parameter. Fe(II) is stable in a well-\u00addefined subset of environmental conditions spanning a range of acidic and reducing conditions (68). It is well known that such microhabitats are present in soil environments, which are also replete with diverse natural products that 75 have antibiotic activities (69). While the evolutionary history of the BqsRS system is unknown, we note that pseudomonads (including P. aeruginosa isolates) are commonly found in soil environments (17). Sensing Fe(II) as proxy for these conditions may allow the cell to modulate its behavior accordingly. Consistent with this hypothesis, the BqsR regulon includes genes that protect the cell against pH and redox stress. For example, BqsRS upregulates dsbB, which helps control disulfide bond formation in the periplasm (70) and carbonic anhydrase, which promotes acid tolerance (71). Intriguingly, the gene in the BqsR ~4000x), is a predicted periplasmic bacterial OB-\u00adfold protein that likely binds positively charged molecules. This suggests that the cell may perceive a significant proportion of the Fe(II) pool in cationic form, consistent with the dominance of this species at low pH and Eh. In summary, the connection between Fe(II) sensing and a response that broadly protects the cell against diverse cationic molecules\u2014including clinically relevant antibiotics\u2014reminds us of the importance of considering environmental chemistry when exploring mechanisms of microbial survival in habitats that include the human body. Typically, CF patients are first treated with aminoglycosides, beta-\u00adlactams, or fluoroquinolones. As lung function declines, polymyxins are employed as a last line of defense due to their harmful side-\u00adeffects (72). It is worth exploring whether a combination of aminoglycosides and polymyxins in conjunction with Fe(II) chelators or novel molecules targeting BqsRS could potentially be administered at lower concentrations, reducing side-\u00adeffects and increasing drug efficacy. 76 Materials and Methods Growth media. E. coli was grown aerobically in LB/ampicillin 100 \u00b5g ml-\u00ad1 at 37 aerobically and anaerobically at 37 oC in MOPS minimal medium (MOMM) in acid washed glassware to ensure cells were Fe limited. The basic MOMM is composed of 40 mM succinate (C4H4Na2O4 \u00b7 6H2O), 9.3 mM NH4Cl, 2.2 mM KH2PO4, 25 mM KNO3, 25 mM NaNO3, 25 mM MOPS, and 25 mM NaMOPS pH 7.2. Additionally, immediately prior to inoculation 100 \u00b5M CaCl2, 1 \u00b5M (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2 \u00b7 6H2O, 1 mM MgSO4, and trace metals were added (73). All PA14 cultures were prepared by inoculation of MOMM media with the desired strains overnight shaking aerobically at 37C. Cultures were grown aerobically into exponential phase (OD5000.4-\u00ad0.6) in fresh MOMM then grown anaerobically with 50 mM nitrate as the electron acceptor in a Coy chamber with an atmosphere of 80% N2, 15% CO2, and 5% H2. For of WT and deletion mutants were incubated 5 \u00b5M or 100 \u00b5M Fe(II). Anaerobic cultures also grown Fe(II) supplemented with 190 \u00b5M mM spermidine, mM spermidine. Table table was modified for 96-\u00adwell plate format to detect [Fe(II)]. All measured Fe concentrations were within 5% of reported value. Cloning methods. The genes of interest were cloned into vectors using the Gibson assembly technique. Briefly, genes were amplified with PCR primers with 20 bp overlap with the vector insertion site sequence with KAPA-\u00adHiFi HotStart (Kapa-\u00adbiosystems) and stitched together with the Gibson assembly kit (New England Biolabs). The resulting plasmids were transformed into E. coli TOP10. For E. coli BqsR expression, the pET15b-\u00adBqsR plasmid was transferred to E. coli BL21 expression strain. The pMQ72 was electroporated into electrocompetent PA14 P. The point mutants were generated through site-\u00addirected For the point mutants expressed from the glmS in the P. aeruginosa bqsR strain, 78 tetraparental conjugation was used to integrate the pUC18T-\u00admini-\u00adTn7T-\u00adBqsR plasmid and the point mutation plasmids (separately) performed using the pUC18T-\u00admini-\u00adTn7 plasmid that included the 1 Kb upstream sequence of the bqs operon, and bqsR, bqsS, or bqsRS.

BqsR was expressed heterologously in E. coli 50 (\u00b5g ml-\u00ad1) with 1% from an overnight culture. Cells were grown to A600 = 0.4 -\u00ad 0.5 and BqsR expression induced with 1 mM IPTG and shifted to 16 oC overnight. Cells were pelleted at 5000 x g for 30 min and resuspended twice with wash buffer (500 mM KCl, 20 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol, and 20 mM Tris 8). DNase ml-\u00ad1) lysate, 5 mM MgSO4, and 130 \u00b5M CaCl2 were added to the suspension. Cell lysate was generated with 14,000 psi on the Avestin Emulsiflex C3 and protease inhibitors added. BqsR was purified on Akta FPLC using 5 ml HisTrap HP (GE Healthcare). Column-\u00adbound BqsR was washed with 100 mM imidazole to remove contaminating proteins and eluted with 200 mM imidazole. After loading 1 mg protein (determined by the Bradford assay) per lane, the 200 mM imidazole fraction contained 81 one band, confirmed by MALDI-\u00adTOF to be BqsR. BqsR was dialyzed overnight with 3 changes of dialysis buffer (50% glycerol,300 mM KCl,50 mM KPO4 pH 7.4), concentrated, and aliquots stored at -\u00ad80 oC. Gel shift assays. Double stranded DNA was generated by boiling equimolar concentrations of single stranded Cy5 labeled reverse complementary DNA sequences (approximately 60 bp in length) for 10 min and allowing to slowly come to room temperature over an hour. Various concentrations of BqsR were incubated with 5 nM double stranded DNA (synthesized and purified by IDT; both strands 5'-\u00adlabeled with Cy5) in reaction buffer (15 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM MgSO4, 50 mM , 40.1 mM K2HPO4, 9.9 mM KH2PO4 pH 7.4) for 20 min at room temperature and run on an 8% acrylamide gel (0.5x TBE, 29 acrylamide: 1 bis-\u00adacrylamide [Bio-\u00adRad]). Each of the above parameters was optimized to yield the cleanest gel shift, yet some smearing remained despite these efforts, possibly influenced by the instability of BqsR. Attempts to chemically phosphorylate BqsR with acetyl-\u00adP to enhance binding affinity were unsuccessful, which is not unprecedented for two-\u00adcomponent transcription factors (75). DNA was visualized with Storm 860 in fluorescence mode using the 635 nm excitation laser. Through the duration of the experiment, the reaction and gel were shielded from light with aluminum foil. Transcription start site determination. . cDNA was generated using gene specific primer 1 and Superscript II (Invitrogen) including the RNase inhibitors, RNasin (Promega) in the 82 reaction. The mRNA template was degraded with RNase H. The cDNA ligated to adaptor DNA (WNp210) with an inverted 3' T. A nested PCR reaction was performed with gene specific primer 2 and a primer complementary to the adaptor sequence (WNp213). The PCR reaction was TOPO cloned and sent for sequencing. The transcription start site is the junction between the adaptor sequence and the gene specific sequence. Point mutation growth conditions. Aerobic cultures of P. aeruginosa PA14 complementation strains and point mutants were grown overnight in 5 ml MOMM. BqsR strains were inoculated cultures were grown at 37 oC until early exponential phase (Beckman Spec20 A500 = 0.2) and harvested with 10 ml RNAprotect. BqsS strains were inoculated into 1 shocked with 200 \u00b5M Fe(II) anaerobically and harvested with 10 ml RNAprotect. Consensus sequence generation. To make an initial BqsR consensus DNA binding site prediction, the 500 base pairs upstream from the translation start site of the 5 most upregulated shock microarray (2) were used as input sequences for the motif finding program, MEME (version 4.9.0) (26). The MEME input parameters allowed for zero or one sequence repetition and 3 motifs returned with 6 - 50 nucleotides per motif. This generated the position weight matrix (PWM) used as the basis for the gel shift 83 assays (Fig. 3-\u00ad2). Several PWM were generated by adding the 500 bp upstream regions of newly qRT-\u00adPCR verified BqsR-\u00adregulated genes to the list of MEME input sequences as the genes were identified. The final version of the PWM was generated with MEME (version 4.9.1). The MEME input parameters allowed for any number of sequence repetitions, 3 motifs returned with 6 - 50 nucleotides per motif, and the program searched the given strand only. For the final version of the PWM the seeding sequences were from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 and validated Fe(II) shock qRT-\u00adPCR experiments that showed upregulation in WT but not in a bqsR mutant. The 500 bp upstream from the following gene translation start sites used for the final the regular expression searching, we identified variants by selecting the most common sequences by eye from our initial PWM (shown in Fig. S1A). For example, in Fig. S1A, position four in the first pentamer shows the most common nucleotides are A and C. Accordingly, our first regular expression was designed with this preference in a tandem repeat orientation, including a variable length linker region (assuming no nucleotide preference in this region). The second regular expression kept the same sequence preferences for the first pentamer, but considered a palindromic structure. The last regular expression was designed as a tandem repeat, only in this case we varied the sequence to reflect the preference shown in the second pentamer in the 84 initial PWM (e.g., position 12-\u00ad16). Using these regular expressions, we searched the intergenic regions of the P. aeruginosa UCBPP-\u00adPA14 genome to identify potential BqsR-\u00adregulated genes (Dataset S1). The PWMs were uploaded into the MAST (version 4.9.1) tool (26) with the upstream regions database selected for the P. aeruginosa UCBPP-\u00adPA14 genome. The E-\u00advalue cutoff was set to 50 and each strand was treated separately since the motif is a tandem repeat (rather than a palindrome). Also, by searching the intergenic regions of the PA14 genome for the most common variants of the tandem repeat consensus sequence, assuming no preference for the 6 nucleotides between the tandem repeat sequences (regular expression), a list of potential BqsR-\u00adregulated genes were identified. These upstream regions were then analyzed by MEME and MAST to generate the most broadly predicted BqsR regulon. We deliberately cast a wide net in our search process in order to identify a large set of genes to consider in follow-\u00adup tests, recognizing that some may be false-\u00adpositives (Dataset S1). Fe(II) shock conditions. Triplicate aerobic cultures of P. aeruginosa WT-\u00adpMQ72 and bqsR-\u00adpMQ72 were grown in MOMM + 100 ml-\u00ad1 gentamycin at 37 oC arabinose. For qRT-\u00adPCR, when the cells reached early exponential phase (OD500 = 0.2), RNAprotect was added before and after a 30 min 200 \u00b5M (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2 \u00b7 6H2O shock to sample the \"unshocked\" and \"shocked\" states, respectively. For the RNA-\u00adSeq 85 experiments, when the cells reached deep stationary phase (OD500 = 0.8), RNAprotect was added before and after a 30 min 200 \u00b5M (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2 \u00b7 6H2O shock. We are confident that Fe(II) induces transcriptional changes, not the counter ion, sulfate, because MOMM contains a background of 1 mM sulfate. Additionally, previous 100 \u00b5M shock experiments were done with either FeCl2 or (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2 \u00b7 6H2O and no difference in expression was seen (2). BqsR regulon gene annotation and classification. Genes seen in bioinformatic predictions and in the RNA-\u00adSeq data were manually annotated from the database with the lowest e-\u00advalue over the largest portion of the gene as viewed on the Pseudomonas Genome Database (36). Databases used include COG (77), TIGRFAM (78), Pfam (79), CD (80), prk (81), and SMART (82). To cluster genes with similar annotations, DAVID (37) was set to medium stringency with all possible input databases and terms selected. RNA-\u00adSeq processing. RNeasy kit (Qiagen) was used to isolate RNA and the Ribo-\u00adZero Magnetic kit (epicentre) was used to deplete rRNA. The NEBNext mRNA Library Prep kit for Illumina (NEB) was used to prepare cDNA libraries for sequencing. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500 with 15 million read sequencing depth, at the Caltech Millard and Muriel Jacobs Genetics and Genomics Laboratory. To analyze the data, Trimmomatic -\u00ad0.32 (83) was used to trim the low quality bases from the reads with parameters set to LEADING:27 TRAILING:27 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:20 MINLEN:35. The 86 trimmed reads were the genome using Bowtie 1.0.1 (84). Samtools 0.1.19 (85) was used to sort the mapped reads. Read counts per gene or transcriptional unit were calculated using Easy RNASeq (86), using .gff gene description files generated from the curated genome hosted by NCBI (NC_008463.1) (Dataset S2), modified by the results of the single nucleotide resolution sequencing published by Wurtzel et al (46) (Dataset S3). Significance values for differential expression were determined (47) using Degust. The full dataset is publicly available through the NCBI gene expression omnibus (GEO ascension number GSE65393). mRNA isolation and qRT-\u00adPCR data analysis. mRNA was isolated using RNeasy kit mini (Qiagen) with optional on-\u00adcolumn DNA digestion according to the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequently, the RNA was treated with TURBO DNA-\u00adfree (Applied BIosystems), the rigorous treatment protocol. cDNA was generated using the extracted RNA as a template for an iScript (Bio-\u00adRad) random-\u00adprimed reverse transcriptase reaction following the manufacturer's protocol. The cDNA was used as template for quantitative PCR (Real Time 7500 PCR Machine, Applied Biosystems) using iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-\u00adRad). The elimination of genomic contamination was confirmed by running a qRT-\u00adPCR control plate with mRNA. Samples were assayed with 3-\u00ad5 biological replicates. recA and clpX were used as endogenous controls (87). Fold changes were calculated using the Ct method (2). 87 Spermidine quantification by HPLC analysis. In order to ensure sufficient spermidine production for visual quantification, 5 mM arginine and 5 mM methionine were supplemented to the MOMM media to provide the precursors for spermidine synthesis; this medium will be subsequently referred to as MOMM+AA. Biological triplicates of PA14, bqsR, bqsS, and bqsRS were in 5 mL MOMM+AA with either 5 \u00b5M Fe or 75 \u00b5M Fe and diluted to an OD500=0.01 in balch tubes containing 20 mL MOMM+AA with either 5 \u00b5M or 75 \u00b5M Fe(II). Cultures were stoppered and grown shaking at 37C until OD0.7. Cells were pelleted in two centrifugations in 15 mL falcon tubes at 6800 rpm for 15 min at 4C, and supernatant was removed. Pellets were then suspended 1M NaCl and 0.1M HEPES pH=7.2 and incubated for 10 min at 37C shaking. Suspension was transferred to a 2mL microfuge tube and centrifuged at 8000rpm for 10 min. Supernatant was removed, and pellet was suspended in 1 mL 10% trichloroacetic acid and incubated at 4C for 3 hours. Suspension was again centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min and supernatant was siphoned off and stored in a glass vial at 4C. 1,3-\u00addiaminopropane was added to the supernatants at a concentration of 30ug/ml as an internal standard for subsequent dabsylation and HPLC analysis of polyamines. 4uL of each sample was dabsylated in triplicate and analyzed by HPLC. Results were normalized by OD500. Polymyxin B killing curve. Triplicate WT and bqsR cultures were grown anaerobically in MOMM + AA + 75 \u00b5M Fe(II) to an OD500 = 0.7. Aliquots were incubated with 88 either water or 25 \u00b5g ml-\u00ad1 polymyxin B for 2 hours. Samples were plated onto LB every 30 min. CFU counts were taken after 24 and 48 hours, incubating aerobically at 37 oC. MIC assays. Cells were or 75 \u00b5M Fe(II). MIC90 was calculated at the time each strain achieved maximum OD500 in wells with no antibiotic added. Each assay was performed with biological triplicates and results were confirmed on two separate occasions. Tobramycin MIC rescue experiments. Ferrozine and spermidine were tested for their ability to rescue tobramycin sensitivity. Cultures were prepared and analyzed as usual, but with the addition of 140 \u00b5M ferrozine or 10 mM spermidine to MOMM + AA + 75 \u00b5M Fe(II), with from 0-\u00ad8 \u00b5g/ml.

Quantitative models that could parlay genomic information into predicted global gene expression levels would enable us to take full advantage of the increased availability of whole genome sequences. Here, we examine the relative contributions of an individual regulatory input, the ferrous iron-\u00adresponsive regulatory element, BqsR, on global patterns of gene expression in the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The position weight matrix (PWM) derived for BqsR uncovered thousands of likely binding sites throughout the genome. Only a subset of these potential binding sites had a regulatory consequence, suggesting that BqsR/DNA interactions were not captured within the PWM or that the broader regulatory context at each promoter played a greater role in setting promoter outputs. The architecture of the BqsR operator was systematically varied to understand how the sequence, length, and orientation of the binding site influences expression. We found that BqsR operator affinity was predicted by the PWM well. However, for most promoter containing BqsR operators, the surrounding regulatory context and the specific combination and arrangement of the transcription factors at each promoter were more influential in setting promoter outputs than the binding energy of individual BqsR binding sites. These results indicate that models derived from PWMs can accurately describe operator affinity, but more comprehensive models that include local regulatory contexts are needed to develop a predictive understanding of global regulatory outputs. 109 Introduction It is well appreciated that the rate of generation of new genome sequencing data is far outpacing our ability to make sense of it. For example, although considerable progress has been made in recent years to understand the roles of noncoding genomic regions (1, 2), our ability to apply this understanding in a predictive fashion is still quite limited. More fundamentally, it is not clear to what extent we can accurately predict genome-\u00adwide regulatory outputs from any DNA nucleotide sequence, though many complementary approaches are being applied to decipher the regulatory logic in the genomes of both eukaryotes and bacteria (3, 4). Here, we put our understanding of how an individual bacterial transcription factor influences global gene expression to the test to explore the extent to which the binding sequence and the surrounding regulatory context tune promoter outputs. Making precise predictions of genome-\u00adwide expression is hampered by an incomplete understanding of how regulatory information is encoded at different promoter regions (3, 5). We cannot accurately predict a priori what influence on gene expression a particular transcription factor will have at a given promoter. For the majority of transcription factors we only know where these factors are likely to bind and whether the transcription factor acts as an activator or repressor. Current models typically cannot quantitatively determine the magnitude of expression, nor predict how expression is modulated by the number of regulatory proteins per cell or the promoter architecture (defined as the sequence, orientation, location, and number of transcription factor 110 binding sites, and their proximity to the RNA polymerase binding site). Even for well-\u00adcharacterized regulators, we are often surprised by experimental results contradicting expected trends (6-\u00ad8). A predictive understanding of how regulatory information is encoded in the genome would lead to more meaningful comparisons between genomes of related organisms, enhance our understanding of regulatory-\u00adgenome changes associated with niche differentiation, and improve our ability to design regulatory networks. We chose the ferrous iron [Fe(II)] responsive two-\u00adcomponent system, BqsRS, from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9) to test our ability to quantitatively predict the regulatory output for a given transcription factor. Most organisms require iron for essential cellular processes, including electron transfer steps in metabolism, but iron is a limiting nutrient in many environments (10). Because iron uptake and localization are critical for growth and function, the cellular response to iron is complex and tightly regulated. In the body, our immune system controls pathogen proliferation in part by sequestering iron though high-\u00adaffinity ferric iron [Fe(III)]-\u00adbinding molecules such as lactoferrin (11). In many environments, including the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung and soil, iron is present in both the Fe(II) and Fe(III) forms (12, 13). Furthermore, elevated Fe(II) in CF sputum correlates with severe disease states (12). BqsRS consists of a sensor histidine kinase (BqsS) and a response regulator (BqsR) that responds specifically to Fe(II) at low micromolar concentrations in the periplasmic space (9). BqsRS is known to be involved in rhamnolipid production and biofilm dispersal (14) and it mediates cellular defenses against cationic 111 stressors, including aminoglycoside and polymyxin antibiotics (15). The consensus BqsR DNA binding motif (15) is found in promoter regions of genes that are upregulated by BqsR, but it remains unclear whether BqsR binding alone is sufficient to elicit a regulatory response, or if the impact of BqsR depends on the context at each promoter. One common model used to predict the influence of transcription factors on global gene expression is based on position weight matrices (PWM) (16, 17). Here, we used the previously derived PWM for the Fe(II) responsive transcription factor BqsR (15) to search for potential binding sites throughout the genome. Thousands of potential binding sites were found; RNA-\u00adSeq expression measurements revealed that the majority of genes containing potential BqsR operators were not strongly regulated by BqsR. This discrepancy suggests that either the PWM of BqsR does not accurately describe the interaction between BqsR and the genome, or that the surrounding operator context has a greater influence on promoter outputs than the local BqsR binding sequence. Through systematic measurements of how the architecture of BqsR containing promoters influences gene expression, we address how BqsR regulatory information is encoded in the genome and to what extent understanding the regulatory context is critical to develop a predictive understanding of the global effect of an individual transcription factor. Results Operator sequence diversity throughout the genome To construct a quantitative model capable of predicting the magnitude of gene expression directly for any given promoter region, we first dissected how variability in the 112 BqsR operator modulates gene expression. BqsR is an activator that binds upstream of the gene transcription start site (Fig. 4-\u00ad1A). Earlier work established that the BqsR binding sequence contained a pair of highly conserved pentamers (Fig. 4-\u00ad1A) (15). Many potential BqsR operators were found within promoter regions throughout the genome (Fig. 4-\u00ad1B). For this study, we defined the promoter region as 1000 bp upstream from the protein coding sequence. There were 330 operators with 2 or fewer mutations in the pair of consensus repeated pentamers (TTAAG(N)6TTAAG), and over 4000 potential operators containing 3 mutations. This frequency of binding sites is not expected to occur by chance in the genome (Supplemental Fig. 4-\u00adS1). Given the large quantity of close matches to the 10 most conserved bp (2 repeats of the pentamer), it is not obvious at which of these operators BqsR binds and has a regulatory consequence. 113 Figure 4-\u00ad1: The BqsR binding motif in the genome and its impact on global expression. A) The response regulator BqsR activates gene expression. The BqsR operator sequence contains a repeated pentamer (TTAAG) separated by 6 bp. B) The number of potential BqsR operators in the genome of P. aeruginosa PA14 sorted by the number of mutations in the repeated pentamers. C) A comparison of the predicted operator strength with the observed experimental fold change in expression. The curve shows the best-\u00adfit linear relationship between the experimentally measured fold change in gene regulation due to iron shock and the predicted operator strength. For operator regions containing multiple BqsR binding sites, only the site with the highest score was plotted. 114 The magnitude of BqsR-\u00admediated gene expression for each of these potential operators can be predicted using a PWM for the operator binding site. A PWM uses a set of promoter sequences to generate a DNA sequence motif reflecting the nucleotide frequency for each position in the sequence (16, 17). The PWM can then be used to rank order the regulatory strength of each potential operator. The operator strength is calculated using operator strength = e-\u00adS, (Equation 1) in which S is the operator score calculated using the PWM (Supplemental Material for further details). Operator strength is assumed to be proportional to the affinity of the operator for BqsR. In Figure 4-\u00ad1C, the scores were calculated using the PWM derived in (15). Here, scores are normalized to the score of the downstream BqsR binding site in the PA14_04180 promoter region, a reference operator whose sequence is listed in Figure 4-\u00ad2A. Figure 4-\u00ad1C compares the measured fold change in gene expression due to the BqsR operator strength calculated using Equation 1, revealing a poor correlation between the PWM predictions and the experimental expression. Typically it is assumed that the rate of gene expression at a given promoter is proportional to the affinity for the transcription factor to the operator, known as the occupancy hypothesis (6). The fact that several binding sites with high PWM scores were not induced by an Fe(II) shock raises several questions: how is regulator-\u00adbinding specificity achieved; how does operator 115 sequence modulate promoter outputs; and to what extent does the surrounding promoter context influence BqsR-\u00admediated regulatory responses? Influence of the pentamer sequence on BqsR-\u00admediated regulation One potential cause of disagreement between model predictions and experimental measurements was that PWM did not accurately capture the relationship between operator sequence and binding affinity. To determine whether the PWM was missing key regulatory information, we experimentally dissected how the structure of the operator (i.e., the sequence, length, and position) affected the level of gene expression. Although we analyzed nucleotide frequency in the genome to inform our experiments, direct experimental measurements were used to construct our model. First we looked at the operator diversity throughout the genome for clues as to which operator variations might impact BqsR-\u00admediated expression. For this analysis FIMO (Find Individual Motif Occurrences), part of the MEME Suite (18), was used to identify potential BqsR binding sites in the genome. These potential operator sequences were further characterized by comparing the sequence, location, and orientation of the binding sites. The operator was split into three regions: the upstream and downstream pentamers and the spacer region (Fig. 4-\u00ad1A). A small library of synthetic promoters was fused to the lacZ reporter gene and inserted into the genome at the glmS locus to quantify the influence of specific changes in promoter architecture on expression output. The synthetic promoter library was based on the BqsR binding sequence in the promoter for gene PA14_04180, the gene most highly upregulated by BqsR. 116 Previously, two repeated pentamers were found to be highly conserved and sufficient for BqsR binding (15). The frequency and identity of mutations in the pentamer regions of potential BqsR binding sites were examined (Fig. 4-\u00ad2B). The PWM of the pentamer regions was calculated using the 330 operator sequences from Figure 4-\u00ad1B containing up to 2 mutations in the pentamer regions (Fig. 4-\u00ad2B). The PWM score indicates the frequency of a given bp at each position in the sequence compared to the background distribution of bp in the genome [Supplemental Equations S1 and S2 and (16, 17)]. Bases with a high score indicate a particular base being favored at a given position, and bases with negative scores indicate bases that are rare at a given position. There is a non-\u00aduniform distribution of the scores, implying that some bases contribute more than others to the binding energy of BqsR to the operator. A library of synthetic promoters based on a modified PA14_04180 promoter was constructed to test the influence of the pentamer sequence on gene expression. Only the upstream pentamer was mutated because the downstream pentamer overlaps the -\u00ad35 region of the RNA polymerase (RNAP) binding site (15). Additionally, the symmetry in the PWM scores in Figure 4-\u00ad2B suggests the two pentamer sequences may interact similarly with BqsR. The reference DNA sequence of the BqsR operator is shown in Figure 4-\u00ad2A. The library contains all possible single point mutations for the upstream pentamer sequence, 15 constructs in total. In Figure 4-\u00ad2C, we report the gene expression level after Fe(II) shock for each mutant relative to the expression level of the wild-\u00adtype promoter containing the binding site shown in Figure 4-\u00ad2A. Expression analysis of the promoter 117 library revealed heterogeneity in the contribution of each position to the expression level. For example, the bases in position 5 have a weak influence on regulation, whereas mutating position 1 from T to C reduced expression nearly 10 fold. The large decrease in expression of this particular mutation may explain why a C in position 1 was rare in the potential binding sites found in the genome (Fig. 4-\u00ad2B). Figure 4-\u00ad2: Variability of the BqsR operator's repeated pentamer sequence and its influence on gene regulation. A) The reference operator found in the PA14_04180 promoter region contains two pentamers separated by a 6 bp spacer region. B) The graph shows the PWM for the upstream and downstream pentamer sequences. PWM scores were calculated using the operators from Figure 4-\u00ad1 containing between 0 and 2 mutations in the pentamer regions. C) Expression measurements of synthetic constructs quantified the influence of each point mutation for all nucleotides in the upstream pentamer on gene expression. Error bars show standard error of biological triplicates. 118 Influence of the spacer sequence on BqsR-\u00addependent regulation In addition to the pentamer region, we also determined the natural variability and influence of the spacer region between the two pentamers on gene regulation. First, we examined the variability of spacer region lengths throughout the genome. All previously reported operator sequences had a spacer length of 6 bp, but it was unclear if spacer length modulated BqsR binding. Analyzing all the potential operators in the genome with spacer lengths of 5, 6, or 7 pairs shows that all the pentamer pairs with no mutations had 6 bp spacer regions, and that a spacer length of 6 bp was most common for operators with a single pentamer mutation (Fig. 4-\u00ad3A). Indeed, spacer length is a key operator parameter. Spacers of length 5 or 7 lowered gene expression to less than 10%, an expression level similar to an operator for which the upstream pentamer has been deleted (control in Fig. 4-\u00ad3B). Together these results suggest that a 6 bp spacer region is essential for operator binding. We also examined expression in operators where the orientation of the upstream operator was changed. In iron responsive regulatory elements such as Fur, repeated hexamers are known to appear in a variety of orientations such as tandem repeats and palindromic orientations (19). For BqsR, it was found that the reverse or reverse complement of the upstream pentamer reduced expression to background levels (Supplemental Fig. 4-\u00adS2). Because the variation in the sequence of the spacer region differed from the background nucleotide frequency in P. aeruginosa, the sequence of the spacer region may have contributed to setting the overall expression level. Synthetic promoters were 119 created to quantify the influence of the spacer region on gene regulation. Because the number of potential spacer sequences was large (46 = 4096), targeted changes were made to the spacer region based on analysis of the spacer regions from pentamers analyzed in Figure 4-\u00ad2B. The spacer PWM scores shows that some bases occur frequently at specific positions, such as a C at position 11 (Fig. 4-\u00ad3). We constructed spacer regions with single mutations from the wild type sequence, position 11 T to C and position 10 G to A, which Figure 4-\u00ad3C suggested would be strongly beneficial and weakly detrimental to expression, respectively. We also constructed two operators containing arbitrary spacer sequences, labeled random in Figure 4-\u00ad3D, and two more containing more common or less common spacer sequences based on the results of Figure 4-\u00ad3C. Figure 4-\u00ad3D shows measurements of gene expression from these constructs, revealing the spacer region sequence has the potential to moderately influence expression levels. For the six sequences measured, gene expression levels were found to vary up to a factor of 2. 120 Figure 4-\u00ad3: Variability of the spacer sequence and its influence on gene regulation. A) The number of operators containing spacers of length 5, 6, or 7 bp is plotted for potential operators containing either 0 or 1 mutations in the pentamer regions, revealing a preference for spacer regions of length 6 bp. B) Experimental measurements of synthetic operators confirm that a 6 -bp spacer length is critical for BqsR-\u00admediated regulation, as spacer lengths of 5 or 7 bp resulted in expression levels similar to the negative control in which the upstream pentamer was deleted. C) Operators from (A) containing a 6 bp spacer region were analyzed for sequence preference by calculating the PWM score. D) Gene expression measurements of 6 synthetic spacer sequences showed that the sequence of the spacer region modulates the level of gene regulation up to a factor of 2. 121 Binding site clusters Yet another aspect of promoter architecture is the number of binding sites in promoter region. We searched the genome for operator clusters with a 6 bp spacer region between pentamers (Fig. 4-\u00ad3C) and only considered operators with a maximum of 3 pentamer mutations. The genome contained hundreds of binding sites with 2-\u00ad5 copies of BqsR operators and promoters with up to 18 clustered potential operators (Fig. 4-\u00ad4A). Supplemental Fig. 4-\u00adS3 shows that the quantity of large binding site clusters cannot be accounted for by a random distribution of binding sites. Some promoters contained overlapping operators that share a common pentamer sequence, creating multiple repeats of the pentamer sequence separated by a 6 bp spacer region with up to 6 repeated pentamers (Fig. 4-\u00ad4B). Because many promoter regions contain repeats of the BqsR operator sequence, we next experimentally dissected the role of operator clusters in the regulatory output. The native promoter region for gene PA14_04180 contains 4 overlapping pentamers as shown in Fig. 4-\u00ad4B (the truncated PA14_04180 promoter used in Fig. 4-\u00ad2 contained only the 2 downstream pentamers). The most downstream pentamer, labeled 4 in Figure 4-\u00ad4B, is unique given that it overlaps the -\u00ad35, RNAP binding site in the promoter. We created several synthetic promoters that lacked one or more pentamers, all of which retained pentamer 4 given its dual role in both BqsR and RNAP binding (Fig. 4-\u00ad4D). A pentamer was deleted by mutating the pentamer sequence from TTAAG to ACTCA. Deleting pentamer 2 or both pentamers 1 and 2 resulted in a 50% decrease in expression 122 level. Deleting either 3 or 1 and 3 resulted in approximately 95% reduction in expression. This suggested BqsR binding to pentamers 3 and 4 was critical for strong expression. The supplemental binding sites 1 and 2 led to an additive increase in promoter output, but were not essential for expression. From these results, we inferred that for other repeated binding sites one pair of pentamers is sufficient to elicit a BqsR response, with additional operators further increasing expression. Figure 4-\u00ad4: Promoters regions with multiple operators. (A) The number of operators within each promoter region of the genome. Operators are sequences 16 bp in length and contain up to 3 mutations in the pentamer regions. (B) Several of these clustered promoters are spaced by 6 bp, the same spacing between the two pentamer regions of an individual promoter, creating arrays of overlapping binding sites as shown in the schematic. (C) The promoter for PA14_04180 is one such promoter containing 4 repeated 123 pentamer regions. (D) Gene expression measurements on synthetic versions of the PA14_04180 promoter, in which individual or pairs of pentamer repeats were removed, revealed that each pentamer repeat contributes to the overall level of gene regulation, although not all the BqsR binding sites contribute equally to the regulatory output. Deriving a binding energy matrix for BqsR From the experimental dissection of BqsR-\u00admediated gene expression, we constructed a BqsR binding energy matrix with a 6 bp spacer region to predict gene regulation for the entire genome. We assumed an additive contribution of operator clusters, operator occupancy was linearly proportional to the change in expression level, and stronger BqsR binding increased transcription. The energy matrix translates the operator nucleotide sequence to binding affinity (Fig. 4-\u00ad2C). Such binding energy matrices have been developed previously for other transcription factors (20, 21), and in the case of the Lac repressor in E. coli have been shown to accurately predict promoter outputs (22). For the pentamer region, measurements of the fold change in expression from Figure 4-\u00ad2C were converted to a change in binding energy using DE = -\u00adkBT ln (fold change), (Equation 2) where kB was Boltzmann's constant, T was the temperature, and DE was the change in the binding energy of BqsR to the operator (see Supplemental section \"Predicting gene expression from operator sequence\" and Figs. 4-\u00adS4 and 4-\u00adS5 for further details). For the spacer region, a \"best fit\" binding energy matrix was fit to the expression data for the 7 variants of the spacer sequence measured in Figure 4-\u00ad3D (see Supplemental Materials section \"Deriving the energy matrix for the spacer region\" and Fig. 4-\u00adS6). 124 The final 16-\u00admer energy matrix reported the change in binding energy for any operator sequence relative to the initial sequence (Fig. 4-\u00ad5B and Supplemental section \"Predicting gene expression from operator sequence\"). Using this matrix we predicted the expression of a given promoter relative to a promoter containing the reference operator (Fig. 4-\u00ad5A). For comparison, Figure 4-\u00ad5C showed the binding energy matrix derived from the PWM. The PWM method of constructing an energy matrix differed from ours in that we did not assume that the consensus sequence in the genome has the strongest binding energy. Although we analyzed potential operators throughout the genome for clues as to what operator parameters might influence regulation, ultimately, our matrix was based on direct, quantitative experimental measurements of gene expression from a library of synthetic operators containing lacZ-\u00adpromoter fusions. 125 Figure 4-\u00ad5: Creating a binding energy matrix for the BqsR operator sequence.

C) For comparison, the energy matrix derived from the position weight matrix used for prediction shown in Fig. 4-\u00ad1C, which was constructed using qPCR expression data for 12 genes. Binding energies in kBT units are relative to the binding strength to the reference operator in (A). Matrix positions in dark red indicate bp changes that cause large reductions in expression levels, whereas matrix positions in dark blue indicate bp that increase expression levels. Global prediction of BqsR-\u00admediated gene regulation With these operator rules and the experimentally derived energy matrix (Fig. 4-\u00ad5B), we made new predictions for BqsR-\u00admediated gene regulation to test if the PWM missed key regulatory information encoded in the primary DNA sequence. If sequence information was missing from the PWM approach, predictions derived from Fig. 4-\u00ad5B will significantly improve our predictive capability. The fold change in gene expression due to 126 each potential operator in the genome was calculated using Equation 2 (see Supplemental Fig. 4-\u00adS7 and 4-\u00adS8 for the distribution of predicted operator affinities). For promoter regions containing multiple BqsR binding sites, we assumed each operator acted independently and the total fold change was the sum of the fold change for each individual operator (see Supplemental section \"Additive approximation for multi-\u00adoperator promoters\" for more details). Since it is known that the position of the operator relative to the transcription start site plays a role in regulatory outputs, we only included potential operators up to 1000 bp upstream from the protein coding sequence. Additionally, genes were predicted to be BqsR-\u00adregulated if they contain a maximum of 3 mutations in the 10 base pairs encoding the upstream and downstream pentamers, resulting in 103 predicted BqsR regulated transcriptional units. These predictions were compared to RNA-\u00adSeq measurements of global BqsR-\u00admediated gene expression reported previously (15). As a conservative annotation of BqsR-\u00adregulated genes we compare transcriptional units [regions which may contain several genes that are co-\u00adtranscribed as defined by Wurtzel et al. (23)] whose expression was changed 2-\u00adfold or greater in WT compared to the bqsR mutant in response to Fe(II) shock. Figure 4-\u00ad6A shows comparisons of the predicted fold change in expression for 103 transcriptional units, predicted using either our binding energy matrix (Fig. 4-\u00ad5B) or the PWM derived binding energy matrix (Fig. 4-\u00ad5C), to the experimentally measured fold change in expression. All predictions were normalized to the expression level of the reference gene (Fig. 4-\u00ad2A). The predictions from our model and the model based on the 127 PWM were similar although not identical (Fig. 4-\u00ad6B). Additionally, our model predictions were accurate for promoters giving a strong response, greater than 25 fold, to ferrous iron shock in experiments (Fig. 4-\u00ad6C). These results suggested that the energy matrix accurately predicted operator occupancy. Our inability to predict the regulatory influence of BqsR at most promoters was not rooted in a misunderstanding of BqsR binding; instead, for most genes the surrounding regulatory context of each promoter was more important than operator occupancy in setting expression levels. 128 Figure 4-\u00ad6: Comparison of global predictions of gene expression using the energy matrices in Figure 4-\u00ad5 to gene expression measured using RNA-\u00adseq. A) Predicted vs. experimentally measured BqsR-\u00admediated fold change in expression levels for 103 genes. Black x's show predicted expression based on the energy matrix shown in Figure 4-\u00ad5B. Blue circles show predicted expression based on the PWM shown in Figure 4-\u00ad5C. B) Both PWM model and our model made similar predictions of fold change in expression. C) Error in prediction, 129 defined as the ratio of predicted to experimentally measured fold change in gene expression, plotted as a function of measured fold change in expression. A closer look at genes that were poorly predicted Both energy matrices in Figure 4-\u00ad5 poorly predicted BqsR-\u00admediated regulation for the majority of the transcriptional units containing predicted BqsR operators. To explore why this might be, we examined the broader regulatory context of each promoter to determine whether the model overlooked key inputs into BqsR-\u00admediated regulatory decisions. One parameter ignored in our initial predictions was the position of the BqsR operator relative to the gene transcription start site (TSS). The results shown in Figure 4-\u00ad6 consider operator position relative to the protein coding sequence (CDS), only including BqsR binding sites within 1000 bp upstream of the protein coding sequence. However, the position of the BqsR binding site relative to TSS as opposed to the CDS was more relevant to transcriptional regulation. The location of a transcription factor binding site relative to the -\u00ad35, RNAP binding site of the promoter influenced promoter output (6). To gauge the influence of the spatial relationship between the TSS and the BqsR binding site on gene expression, the distance between the TSS and the BqsR operators was examined. Figure 4-\u00ad7A showed the ratio of the predicted expression level to the experimentally measured expression level as a function of operator position. Only 75 of the 103 transcriptional units predicted in Figure 6 are plotted in Figure 4-\u00ad7A, as the TSS for many transcriptional units could not be determined from the RNA-\u00adSeq data and were not previously reported (23). Operator positions were reported relative to the TSS. A ratio near 1 indicated an accurate prediction, with higher values signifying greater error. 130 Although it was interesting that most of the potential operators were found near the TSS, Figure 4-\u00ad7A indicated predictability was not correlated with operator position. Predictions for genes with operators located downstream of the TSS all had ratios of the predicted to experimentally measured change in gene expression greater than 45 (Fig. 4-\u00ad7A), which may reflect an inability of BqsR to regulate gene expression from a downstream position. However, the sample size of 6 was too small to be conclusive. In general we predicted a higher level of expression than experimentally observed, potentially caused by our assumption of additive contributions from multiple operators in the same promoter region. To analyze the impact of operator number on predictive ability, we examined the ratio of predicted to measured expression as a function of the number of putative operators in the promoter region (Fig. 4-\u00ad7B). Each individual BqsR operator contained two pentamer regions separated by 6 bp with any number of nucleotides allowed between the 16-\u00admer operators. The results reveal a trend of poor predictions for promoter regions containing multiple BqsR binding sites. For promoter regions containing up to three operators, predictive ability varied, but in general predictions were within 50 fold of measured values. For promoter regions containing 4 or more binding sites, predictions were typically higher than experimental measurements by a factor of 50 or more, with the poorest predictions occurring for the two promoters containing 8 and 9 operators. These results suggest that the assumption that operators behave independently may not be valid for promoter regions containing many operators, and that some operators in large clusters of binding sites may be nonfunctional. To 131 further analyze operator clusters we modeled a promoter region with two binding clusters. Considering the assumptions that operators act independently, the strongest binding operator dominates expression level, only the operator closest to the coding sequence changes has a regulatory consequence, and operator orientation relative to the direction of gene coding sequence did not significantly improve predictions (See Supplemental Figs. 4-\u00adS9 through 4-\u00adS12). Role of additional transcription factors in regulation We next examined whether the poorly predicted transcriptional units had other known transcription factor binding sites in their promoter regions. To address this, we took a two-\u00adpronged approach. We used the PWMs reported for the 12 P. aeruginosa transcription factors annotated on the Prodoric database (24). However, due to our findings that PWMs vastly overpredict potential operators, we also compared our predicted regulon (defined as the genes under BqsR control) with 13 experimentally validated P. aeruginosa regulons (25-\u00ad38). Only two transcription factors, Anr (25) and PqsR regulons (32, 33), had experimentally determined regulons that had a statistically significant overlap with the transcriptional units predicted to be upregulated by BqsR but which were not upregulated in the RNA-\u00adSeq data (Fig. 4-\u00ad7C \"false positives\" and Table 4-\u00adS1). PqsR controls the Pseudomonas quorum sensing regulon that responds to PQS; Dong et al. (14) showed the concentration of PQS is reduced in the bqsR mutant. Cells were grown in anaerobic conditions to ensure Fe(II) remained stable, the condition where Anr is active. 132 Figure 4-\u00ad7C \"false negatives\" also shows overlap of the RpoN (34) regulon with transcriptional units whose expression levels changed as a result of the iron shock, but were not predicted. RpoN encodes an alternate sigma factor induced in stationary phase (39) and under nitrogen limitation, and has been shown to influence quorum sensing regulation (40). The cells used in the RNA-\u00adSeq experiment were harvested in late stationary phase. All of the overlapping genes predicted showed upregulation by RpoN. The PWMs from the Prodoric database were used to predict potential transcription factor binding sites throughout the P. aeruginosa PA14 genome. In an attempt to limit the error associated with PWM-\u00adbased predictions, for each predicted transcription factor operator we assumed only the most probable 100 binding sites were capable of having a regulatory influence. Overall we identified potential secondary regulators in 36 of the 103 predicted transcriptional units (Fig. 4-\u00ad7D). Some transcription factors occurred in several genes that contain BqsR binding sites, suggesting there could be significant crosstalk between these factors when making regulatory decisions. To gauge whether the presence of specific transcription factors led to poor predictions of gene expression, the average prediction to measurement ratio for all the genes containing each of the secondary transcription factor was calculated (Fig. 4-\u00ad7D). Genes containing the transcription factors Fur, PsrA, and Vfr were all predicted well, despite the potential influence of these additional regulators. Expression measurements for genes containing Anr, AlgR, RcsB, RhlR, and ExsA in their promoter regions deviated most from predictions. Because the presence of a potential RhlR binding site in promoter regions caused the 133 most deviation between predictions and experimental measurements, the effect of RhlR on BqsR-\u00admediated gene expression was examined in further detail. Figure 4-\u00ad7: The influence of operator position and secondary transcription factors on the ability to predict BqsR-\u00admediated gene regulation. A) For the genes predicted in Figure 4-\u00ad6A, the error in prediction, defined as the ratio of predicted over experimentally measured expression levels, is shown as a function of operator positions relative to the transcription start site. A prediction error of 1 indicates the measurement exactly matched the prediction. B) Error in prediction plotted as a function of the number of BqsR binding sites found in the promoter region. C) Venn diagrams showing regulon overlaps between the predicted genes and selected transcriptional regulators with statistically significant overlap. See section \"Comparison to other operons\" in Supplemental Materials. D) Position weight matrices for 12 transcription factors were used to identify which of the predicted genes were likely to be coregulated by an additional transcription factor. The upper graph shows the number of promoter regions 134 containing a potential binding site for a second transcription factor. Bars on the bottom graph show the average prediction error for each set of genes containing a secondary transcription factor; the larger the ratio, the greater the error. Measuring gene expression from promoters coregulated by both BqsR and RhlR Prodoric was used to search promoter regions of BqsR-\u00adregulated genes for potential RhlR binding sites. Intriguingly, the RhlR binding motif overlapped with the BqsR binding site in many of the promoters. In the bqs promoter the RhlR binding site overlaps with the upstream BqsR pentamer and the downstream BqsR pentamer overlaps with the -\u00ad35 RNAP binding site. In these overlapping promoters, because RhlR and BqsR cannot bind simultaneously, high levels of RhlR should competitively exclude BqsR and thus lower expression. Ordinarily the quorum sensing gene rhlR is upregulated in response to an autoinducer indicative of high cell density during stationary phase. RhlR can act as a repressor or an activator (41). An rhlR overexpressing strain was used to express RhlR in early exponential phase. To determine the effect of RhlR on bqsR expression, qPCR analysis was used. Figure 4-\u00ad8b shows BqsR-\u00addependent expression of genes predicted to have an RhlR binding site. For all genes, the RhlR overexpressing strain showed a statistically significant (p-\u00advalue 0.05 by unpaired two-\u00adtailed t-\u00adtest) decrease in expression compared to wildtype. For oprH, a gene containing a BqsR-\u00adresponsive operator but not a putative RhlR binding site, expression did not significantly change when RhlR was overexpressed. RhlR significantly changes the regulatory influence of BqsR in promoter regions containing BqsR and RhlR operators. 135 Figure 4-\u00ad8: Fold change in expression due to ferrous iron shock for promoters coregulated by both BqsR and RhlR. For genes containing and RhlR binding (bqsP, PA14_01240, PA14_04180, and PA14_07000), the fold change in expression due to Fe(II) shock was decreased upon overexpression of RhlR, demonstrating the ability of RhlR to modulate the effect BqsR has on expression at these promoters. Expression from the oprH promoter, which does not contain an RhlR binding site, was not significantly influenced by RhlR overexpression. The inset shows the bqs promoter, which contains overlapping operators. WT response is shown in white, bqsR is shown in red, and WT overexpressing rhlR is shown in blue. *indicates a p-\u00advalue < 0.05. Discussion Using the P. aeruginosa Fe(II) responsive regulator, BqsR, as a test case, we examined our ability to make quantitative predictions about the influence of an individual transcription factor on global gene expression levels. A PWM model did not accurately predict global gene expression patterns, leading us to hypothesize that either the PWM model did not capture how operator affinity was encoded in the operator sequence, or that the regulatory influence BqsR was dictated by the surrounding regulatory context of 136 each promoter. A detailed model of operator binding through a synthetic promoter library revealed that predicting transcription factor affinity alone was insufficient to predict the global expression levels. By examining the effect of operator number and distribution, proximity to the transcription start site, and the presence of secondary regulators, we found that secondary regulators were more important than operator occupancy in determining the influence of BqsR on expression levels at promoters throughout the genome. While our model of operator occupancy outperformed the original PWM-\u00adderived model, the improvement was modest. Similarity between our binding energy matrix and the PWM supports the ability of PWM to describe operator affinity, at least when enough operator sequences can be identified to calculate an accurate binding matrix. However, our results underscore that caution should be used in relating operator strength to expression levels. Many genes highly upregulated in experiments were accurately predicted (within a factor of 3), but more than 150 operators with binding strengths predicted to be stronger than the most upregulated gene (PA14_04180) had weak or immeasurable expression. This type of disagreement between experimental measurements and predictions highlights how difficult it is to make reliable predictions of gene expression directly from the genome sequence, and call attention to the need to more systematically study the influence of the broader regulatory context. That the broader regulatory context may control the influence of individual transcription factors is not a new idea. Several studies have attempted to predictively 137 integrate inputs from multiple transcription factors at a single promoter; however, none of these studies used their findings to predict expression for all promoter contexts within the genome (42-\u00ad45). The role of DNA structure in modulating promoter inputs has also been examined. Genome shape and mechanics, such as nucleosome wrapping and DNA loop formation, mediate both transcription factor binding and interactions (3, 8, 46). DNA can also mediate allosteric effects between adjacent transcription factors (47). Regulatory interactions have also been explored from a systems perspective (48), with one study reported that only 60% of the interactions between regulators could be accurately predicted in E. coli (4). Despite careful studies on many aspects of the broader regulatory context in several systems, it remains unclear to what extent a general framework can predict the influences of promoter context on regulation. Moving forward, we can leverage the lessons learned here by examining in more detail remaining questions. For example, several promoters have large clusters of binding sites, unlikely to be present by pure chance, however our predictive ability decreased with increasing cluster size. Perhaps under the conditions measured, weaker operators have a low probability of occupancy and therefore do not contribute to regulation (49), although how weak an operator must be before it no longer modulates expression level is unclear, and may be context dependent (50). By examining a broader set of expression conditions, we may be able to develop a set of rules that predict when and how the number of operators in the clusters is significant. Additionally, we should transition from the bioinformatic analysis presented here to rigorous experimental quantification of the role 138 multiple transcription factors play in modulating promoter outputs. Future quantitative regulatory models should incorporate feedback in the dynamics of transcription factor levels. These types of experiments would enhance our understanding of how natural genomes encode regulatory outputs. Predicting signal integration at the promoter level remains a challenge. Bacteria respond to a wide variety of external stimuli, offering useful model systems in which to understand the logic and mechanisms of signal integration at the promoter level. Such work would complement ongoing efforts in synthetic and developmental biology (45, 48, 51). Methods Growth media and culturing conditions. P. aeruginosa PA14 was grown both aerobically and anaerobically at 37 oC in MOPS minimal medium (MOMM) in acid washed glassware to ensure cells were Fe-\u00adlimited. The basic MOMM is composed of 40 mM C4H4Na2O4 \u00b7 6H2O, 9.3 mM NH4Cl, 2.2 mM KH2PO4, 25 mM KNO3, 25 mM NaNO3, 25 mM MOPS, 25 mM NaMOPS pH 7.2. Additionally, immediately prior to inoculation 100 \u00b5M CaCl2, 1 \u00b5M (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2 \u00b7 6H2O, 1 mM MgSO4, and trace metals were added (52). Any composition changes are noted. All PA14 cultures were prepared by inoculation of MOMM media with the desired strains for 16 hours overnight shaking aerobically then grown anaerobically in a coy chamber with an atmosphere of 80% N2, 15% CO2, and 5% H2 at 37C. Strain construction. The strains used in this work were constructed from the wild type strain P. aeruginosa UCBPP-\u00adPA14. To monitor gene expression in these strains, the gene 139 construct containing the versions of the PA14_04180 promoter attached to the lacZ reporter gene were inserted into the genome. Briefly, Gibson assembly was used to insert a gene construct containing 530 bases of the wildtype PA14_04180 attached to lacZ between the transposon sites of the plasmid pUC18T-\u00admini-\u00adTn7t. The region between the transposon sites contained a selection marker for growth on gentamicin. This base construct was then mutated using site directed mutagenesis to create synthetic versions of the promoter. Gene constructs were transferred into the glmS locus of the genome of P. aeruginosa using triparental mating (53). Once inserted, constructs were verified using Sanger sequencing. Measuring gene expression of mutant library in response to iron shock. The gene reporter lacZ quantified the change in gene expression in response to changes in ferrous iron. Anaerobic cultures grown to final OD500 of 0.2-\u00ad3 were uncapped inside of an anaerobic chamber and aliquoted to 1.7 ml tubes containing a final concentration of 400 mM ferrous iron (solutions of FeNH4SO4). Shocking with 400 mM Fe(II) more rapidly induced the maximal BqsR-\u00admediated regulatory response observed with 200 mM Fe(II), which was used in previous RNA-\u00adSeq experiments (9) (Supplemental Fig. S13). Fe(II) has been measured approaching 300 \u00b5M in CF sputum (12). A ferrozine assay was used to confirm the concentration of the stock ferrous iron solution. The ferrous iron treatment was performed in triplicate for each strain measured. Cells were incubated in the anaerobic chamber at room temperature for 4 hours and then transferred to a 96 well plate for 140 measurement of gene expression. Each well received 150 mL of ferrous iron treated cells with 50 mL of a media containing 50 ng/ml of the fluorogenic LacZ and emission of 490 nm and 520 nm, respectively, were measured in each well under anaerobic conditions every 5 min for 1 hour with a BioTek Synergy 4 plate reader. See Supplemental Fig. 4-\u00adS13 for control experiments regarding this procedure. To calculate the change in gene expression after Fe(II) shock, the background corrected fluorescence measurements were divided by the background corrected absorbance measurement to quantify the gene expression per cell. To calculate the fold change in gene expression for a given strain, the gene expression measurement was divided by the expression from a strain containing the reference BqsR operator shown in Fig. 4-\u00ad2A. The wildtype or initial operator sequence is shown in Figure 4-\u00ad2A in the main text and is based on the downstream operator of the PA14_04180 gene. RhlR and BqsR co-\u00adregulon prediction. The position weight matrix for the RhlR DNA binding site (30) was input into FIMO (18), a tool which searches for a consensus sequence within a database. In this case, the database supplied was the 500 bp upstream from the translation start site for genes in the BqsR regulon. Effect of RhlR on Fe(II) shock conditions. Aerobic cultures of P. aeruginosa wt-\u00adpMQ72 (54), bqsR-\u00adpMQ72, and wt-\u00adpMQ72-\u00adrhlR were grown in 3 MOMM supplemented with 100 \u00b5g/ml gentamycin at 37 oC for 36 hours. Anaerobic cultures were grown in 20 ml MOMM 141 supplemented with 100 \u00b5g/ml gentamycin induce rhlR expression) with 1% inoculum from aerobic overnight. When the cells reached early exponential phase (Beckman spectrophotometer 20; OD500 = 0.2), 9 ml of culture was removed. 4.5 ml culture was added to 9 ml of RNAprotect (Qiagen) before and after a 30 min 200 \u00b5M ferrous ammonium sulfate shock at room temperature. The cells were incubated with RNAprotect for 5 min and centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 x g. The supernatant was discarded and the pellets stored at -\u00ad80 oC. mRNA isolation and qPCR data analysis. mRNA was isolated from stored cell pellets using the RNeasy kit mini (Qiagen) with optional on-\u00adcolumn DNA digestion according to the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequently, the RNA was treated with TURBO DNA-\u00adfree (Applied BIosystems. cDNA was generated with iScript (Bio-\u00adRad) following the manufacturer's protocol. An mRNA genomic contamination control and cDNA was used as template for quantitative-\u00adreverse transcriptase-\u00adPCR (Real Time 7500 PCR Machine, Applied Biosystems) SYBR recA and clpX were used as endogenous controls (55). Fold changes were calculated using the Ct method (9). To ensure recA was constant in all conditions tested, the relative fold change for the internal control clpX, whose expression was also expected to remain constant across all our treatments. Only those samples with a clpX fold change between 142 0.5 - 2 were used. Log2 of the final fold change was reported. Results were compared with an unpaired 2-\u00adtailed t-\u00adtest concentration. The Stookey method (56) was modified for 96-\u00adwell plate format. All measured Fe(II) concentrations were within 5% of reported value. Bioinformatics. To analyze potential BqsR binding sites in the genome, occurrences of the motif (TTAAG(N)6TTAAG) were found in the genome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 using the program FIMO (Find Individual Motif Occurrences), part of the MEME Suite (18). Motif occurrences were then sorted and analyzed using Matlab. The same process was used to locate binding sites of other transcription factors using binding motifs listed in the Prodoric database (24). Comparison to the other operons. From published microarray and RNA-\u00adSeq papers regulons (25-\u00ad38) for other transcription factors were defined. The list of genes in the transcription factor regulons were converted to transcriptional units (23). Comparisons between transcriptional units (TU) in the regulon to two lists were made to discover the number of shared TUs: TUs in prediction but not observed in RNA-\u00adseq data and TUs in RNA-\u00adSeq data but not predicted. In R, a hypergeometric test assigned a p-\u00advalue to the 143 overlapping regulons. For those regulons with significant overlap, whether the TUs were upregulated or downregulated was noted. See Supplemental Material for further details.

D.K.N. is an HHMI Investigator. Supplemental Material Position weight matrix calculations Position weight matrix (PWM) calculations are performed following (16,17). From a list of N operator sequences, the frequency of each bp at each operator position is calculated using !!\"=!!\"!!!!!, (Equation S1) where pxi is the estimated probability of having nucleotide x at position i, nxi is the number of sequences containing nucleotide x at position i. The +1 in the numerator ensure that pxi > 0. From these frequencies and given the background frequency of AT in the genome as 66% (57), the score (S) of any operator sequence of length L is calculated using, !=!\"!!!!!!\"!!, (Equation S2) 144 where qx is the background frequency of the nucleotide in position x. The score is proportional to the binding energy of BqsR to a given operator sequence, with greater scores indicating stronger binding. Score as defined in Equation S2 is used in Figures 4-\u00ad1C, 4-\u00ad2B, and 4-\u00ad3C. To determine how a change in the operator sequence influences the BqsR binding energy, the score of the mutated operator is subtracted from the score of the original operator. Bioinformatic analysis of the genome FIMO (Find Individual Motif Occurrences), part of the MEME Suite (18), was used to find potential BqsR binding sites in the genome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain UCBPP-\u00adPA14. An input sequence of TTAAG(N6)TTAAG was used with a threshold p-\u00advalue of 0.1, resulting in over 80,000 output sequences. A large p-\u00advalue threshold was used to include all potential sequences. Custom Matlab code was used to sort through the FIMO output sequences. Each sequence was mapped onto the genome to determine the orientation and position of each sequence relative to the coding sequences of each gene. Sequences not falling within 0 to -\u00ad1000 bp of a coding sequence were discarded. Mutations in the pentamer regions of each sequences were then identified, as compared to TTAAG(N6)TTAAG using a Matlab code. To find sequences with spacer lengths of 5 or 7, the input sequence to FIMO was adjusted to TTAAG(N5)TTAAG or TTAAG(N7)TTAAG, respectively. 145 Estimates of number of binding sites The number of binding sites expected within a genome of size 6,537,647 bp was calculated assuming the probability of a G or C is 33% at a given position and the probability of an A or T is 17% at a given position. Each binding sites has a specified number of mutations within the 10 bp of the repeated pentamer region and is separated by 6 random bp. These random binding sites can occur anywhere within the genome and have either orientation. For example, to calculate the probability of an operator with zero pentamer mutations, Pperfect operator, to occur (the identity of 10 bp is specified), we use Pperfect operator = 2 (pAT8 pCG2), (Equation S3) where pAT is percent of A or T bp in the genome (16.7%) and pCG is percent of C or G bp in the genome (33.3%). The factor of 2 accounts for the operator occurring in either orientation. Using the values for the P. aeruginosa genome, the probability of a zero mutant operator is approximately 10-\u00ad7. To estimate the number of zero mutant operators expected by chance in the genome, we multiple the probability of a zero mutant operator by the number of bp in the genome since each position in the genome is a potential starting sites for the operator sequence. Similar calculations estimate the number of 1, 2, and 3 mutation operators in the genome we should expect by chance. For these calculations we take into account that a mutation can occur in any of the 10 repeated pentamer positions. For example, to calculate the probability of an operator with 1 pentamer mutation, we use P1 mutation operator = 2 ( 8(pAT7 pCG2) + 2(pAT8 pCG) ) - Pperfect operator. (Equation S4) 146 The factors of 8 and 2 inside the parentheses account for the number of ways in which a mutation in an A or T or a G could occur, respectively. Pperfect operator is subtracted because the first factor calculates the probability of an operator with either 0 or 1 mutation in the pentamer, i.e., the changed base is just unspecified, meaning that it could either be a mutation or the original base. As shown in Figure 4-\u00adS1, there are more pentamer regions without mutations than expected in the genome and fewer operators with 1, 2, or 3 pentamer mutations than would be expected by chance. Figure 4-\u00adS1: The distribution of operators containing 0, 1, 2, and 3 mutations in the ten bp of the repeated pentamer. Blue bars show the actual distribution in the genome of P. aeruginosa and the red bars show the number of expected operators that would occur by chance in a genome of the same size with a GC content of 66%. Influence of pentamer orientation on BqsR-\u00admediated gene regulation 147 Figure 4-\u00adS2: Changing the upstream pentamer to the reverse (TTAAG to GAATT) or the reverse complement (TTAAG to CTTAA) reduced the fold change in expression to the level of the negative control in which the upstream pentamer was deleted. Error bars show standard error. Distribution of Binding Sites in the Genome To put the distribution of repeated and clustered BqsR binding sites shown in Figure 4-\u00ad4 into context, calculations estimated the occurrence of repeated and clustered binding sites. There are 6192 BqsR operators with up to 3 pentamer mutations throughout the genome of P. aeruginosa. To estimate the extent of operator clustering we might expect by chance, Matlab simulations were run to calculate the average cluster sizes when 6192 operators were inserted into a genome of size 6,537,647 bp. This genome contained genes in the same locations as the P. aeruginosa. The randomly inserted operators each operator have a unique starting position, but partial overlap of operator sequences was allowed. Each operator was assigned a random orientation. The operators could be inserted into any position within the genome. Five such random operator distributions were created and analyzed. 148 In these five random distributions, no repeated binding sites were observed, that is no repeats of more than two pentamers spaced by 6 bp with identical orientation were observed. Therefore, the repeats of up to 7 pentamers found in the actual genome, including 226 such repeats with 3 pentamers in a row, could not have happened by chance. On average these randomly placed 6192 BqsR operators ended up in the regulatory regions, from -\u00ad1000 to 0 of the coding sequence, of 3,651 genes. This is slightly more than the 3,112 genes in the real genome containing BqsR operators. As shown in Figure 4-\u00adS3, the real genome has much larger clusters of operators within the same regulatory region. Cluster size is the number of operators within 1000 bp upstream of the gene coding sequence, regardless of operator orientation or relative spacing. Randomly placed operators only occasionally resulted in a cluster of 7 operators, i.e., a promoter region containing 7 total operators, whereas the real genome contains several clusters of more than 10 operators in the same regulatory region. Figure 4-\u00adS3: Clusters of binding sites found within 1000 bp upstream of the start of gene coding sequences. The distribution of cluster sizes for the genome of P. aeruginosa (blue) compared to the number of clusters for a random redistribution of the same number of 149 operators throughout the genome. For the random distribution, a number in genome less than 1 indicates that not all random distributions measured contained a cluster of that size. Predicting gene expression from operator sequence In our experiments we are measuring the fold change in gene expression upon mutating an operator sequence from its wild-\u00adtype sequence. From this fold change we can calculate the relative change in the operator binding energy as a result of the change in the operator sequence. The model used to analyze the data is derived as previously described for the promoters such as the lac promoter for E. coli. Briefly, in this model the rate of transcription is proportional to the probability of finding RNA polymerase bound to the promoter. The probability of finding the polymerase on the promoter is calculated using a thermodynamic quasi-\u00adequilibrium model. In the model the promoter has several possible microstates that are defined by the configuration of the RNA polymerase and the transcription factors on the promoter. The probability of a specific configuration is related to the copy numbers and binding energies of the proteins bound to the promoter region. These microstates and related Boltzmann terms are shown in Figure 4-\u00adS4 for the BqsR binding promoter we are using is this study. In these Boltzmann weights, P is the number of RNA polymerase molecules per cell, A is the number of BqsR transcription factors per cell, Ea is the binding energy of BqsR to its operator sequence, Ep is the binding energy of RNA polymerase to its promoter sequence, Ec accounts for cooperativity between BqsR 150 and RNA polymerase, NNS is the number of nonspecific binding sites in the genome, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is temperature. Figure 4-\u00adS4: States and weights for BqsR-\u00admediated gene regulation. In the bottom state there is cooperativity between RNA polymerase and BqsR, resulting in increased occupancy of the promoter by RNA polymerase in the presence of BqsR. Another parameter which determines the production rate of mRNA is the rate constant for transcription of each promoter microstate. Any state in which the RNA polymerase is not bound has a transcriptional rate constant of zero. Each state in which the RNA polymerase is bound has a non-\u00adzero transcriptional rate constant, as listed in Figure 4-\u00adS4. 151 From the Boltzmann weights listed in Figure 4-\u00adS4, we can now derive the rate of transcription. The transcription rate is the sum of the probability of each state, pi , times the rate of transcription, ri. This gives, !\"#$%&\"'(!')$ !\"#$= !!!!. (Equation S5) The probability of a state is the Boltzmann weight for that state divided by the sum of the Boltzmann weights for every possible microstate: !!= !!!!. (Equation S6) From these definitions we can derive the transcription rate for our particular system as, !\"#$%&\"'(!')$ !\"#$= !!!!!\"!!!!!!!! !!!!!\" !!!\"!!(!!!!!!\u0000!)!!!!!!!!\"!!!!!!!!!!!\" !!!\"!!(!!!!!!!!)!!!!!!!\"!!!!!!!. (Equation S7) Now consider we make a change to the operator sequence to which the transcription factor BqsR binds. We assume that this change in the operator sequence only influences the binding energy of BqsR to its operator and has no influence on both the transcription rate constant and the cooperativity term from the RNA polymerase and BqsR bound microstate. The binding energy of BqsR to the mutated operator sequence we call Em. From this definition we can calculate the fold change in the transcription rate upon mutating the BqsR Experimentally, this fold change is equivalent to the ratio of gene expression for cells containing the wild-\u00adtype operator sequence to cells containing the mutated operator. This equation can be simplified to !\"#$ !!\"#$= S9) the approximation that the transcription rate in the BqsR bound case is much larger than the transcription rate when only the RNA polymerase is bound, i.e., !!!! !!!\"!!(!!!!!)!!!1 and !!!! !!!\"!!(!!!!!)!!!1, we can further simplify the fold change expression, !\"#$ !!\"#$=!!!\"!!!!!!!)(!! !!!\"!!!!!!!)!!!\"!!!!!!!)(!! !!!\"!!!!!!!). (Equation S10) This approximation is well supported by the experimental data in Figure 4-\u00adS5, which shows the expression of the reporter gene LacZ is low the in the absence of strong BqsR activation. 153 Figure 4-\u00adS5: Fold change in expression in the absence of strong BqsR activity. Without iron shock, no extra iron is added during the shock, the fold change in expression is 9 \u00b1 4%. Upon mutating all five bases of the upstream operator, the fold change in expression fell to 11 \u00b1 4%. Given the mutations made in the pentamer (TTAAG to ACTCA), we would calculate residual expression of 7%. These measurements were taken using the LacZ gene reporter for the mutated PA14_04180 promoter region containing only two pentamers. The final bar shows the change in gene expression for the wild-\u00adtype version of gene PA14_04180 upon deleting BqsR from the genome, measured using qPCR. Together these indicate that the gene expression level of PA14_04180 in the absence of BqsR-\u00admediated activation should be negligible. With this further simplification the transcription rate constants have now been removed from the fold change expression. The remaining expression has two interesting limits. In the limit that !!!\"!!!!!!!1 and !!!\"!!!!!!!1, the fold change goes to 1. In this limit, the probability of BqsR being bound is very large, therefore it is not surprising that a change in the BqsR binding energy may not result in a change in the fold change. We could call this the operator saturation limit. The more interesting limit is when !!!\"!!!!!!!1 and !!!\"!!!!!!!1, when we would not expect to always find BqsR bound to the operator. In other words, we still expect some \"action\" from changes in BqsR copy 154 number and binding energy. In the limit of not saturating the operator the fold change simplifies to, S12) where DEmut is the change in the binding energy due to the mutation. From the fold change measurement we can calculate the change in the BqsR binding energy caused by the mutation in the operator. In the reverse case, we can also then back calculate the fold change for a given operator if we know how each basepair mutation influences the binding energy. This assumes that each individual mutation in the operator sequence has an additive effect on the operator binding energy, a first approximation that has proven useful in previous examples (20,22). To be more explicit, starting from the wild-\u00adtype operator, if we have 3 point mutations in the operator we would expect the fold change to be, !\"!\" !!\"#$=!!(!!!!!!!!!!!)!!!=!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. (Equation S13) In Equation S13 DEmi is the change in the binding energy due to the ith mutation in the operator sequence. Of course we should keep in mind that this fold change is relative to the gene expression from the \"wild-\u00adtype\" sequence and not an exact level of expression (unless of course we knew the precise level of gene expression in the wild-\u00adtype case). 155 Another way of looking at this result is that you can multiple together the fold changes due to each change in the operator sequence. For example if mutation 1 has a fold change of 0.8 and mutation 2 has a fold change of 0.5, the predicted fold change for an operator with both mutations would be the product of the two fold changes or 0.4. Deriving the energy matrix for the spacer region To derive the \"best-\u00adfit\" matrix, first we assume the sequence of the spacer region does not influence expression. This is equivalent to saying all the bases of the spacer region contribute 0 kBT to the binding energy. From this starting matrix, we predict the expression level for synthetic promoters containing the 7 spacer sequences (Fig. 4-\u00ad3D), and calculate the deviations of the predictions from the experimental measurements using Equation 2. The value of the matrix at a random position is then increased or decreased by 4%, and new deviations from the measured expression levels are calculated. If the prediction was more accurate, the change to the energy matrix was retained. If the prediction was less accurate, there was a 1% chance the change was kept. This process was iterated 10,000 times to generate a final matrix that is the best fit to the experimental data. To ensure that the fitting procedure did not get stuck at a local minimum, the whole process was then repeated from the all zeros spacer energy matrix 100 times and these 100 final matrices were averaged together. Supplemental Figure 4-\u00adS6 shows the final energy matrix after 10,000 iterations has reached an optimum. 156 Figure 4-\u00adS6: In fitting the energy matrix for the middle 6 bp of the operator, the value of the binding energy matrix for a random basepair was increased or decreased by 4% and the resultant error in the prediction using this new energy matrix was calculated. As mutations accumulated, the square in the error quickly reduced to a level less than 10-\u00ad3. The graph above shows the squared error as a function of the number of changes for 5 independent fits. The spacer region for the energy matrix reported in Figure 4-\u00ad5B averages together 100 such replicate fits. Distribution of operator affinities and gene expression Figure 4-\u00adS7: The distribution of predicted operator affinities for all 4415 operators containing less than 3 pentamer region mutations found within 1000 bp upstream of the coding sequence. Operator affinity is the negative exponential of the change in binding energy divided by kBT. Binding energies for each operator were calculated using the energy matrix in Figure 4-\u00ad5B of the main text. The starting sequence shown in Figure 4-\u00ad5A 157 has a predicted operator affinity of 1. The model assumes operator affinity is proportional to fold change in expression. Figure 4-\u00adS8: The distribution of predicted fold change in gene expression for all genes containing a BqsR operator with fewer than 3 pentamer mutations within 1000 bp upstream of the coding sequence. Predictions are scaled such that the prediction for the reference gene PA14_04180 matches the experimentally measured value. Additive approximation for multi-\u00adoperator promoters To predict expression from promoter regions containing multiple BqsR binding sites, we used an additive model. From the results of Figure 4-\u00ad4, we found that having multiple binding sites in the same promoter region leads to increased expression in the case of the PA14_04180 promoter. We approximated the combined influence of multiple operators at the same promoter using an additive model in which !\"#$ !!\"#$ !\" !\"#$!%%&'(!\"!#$=!\"#$ !!\"#$!. (Equation S14) Fold changei is the fold change due to operator i, where fold change is calculated using Equation 2. This additive approximation is equivalent to assuming the two operators act independently on gene expression. 158 To access the consequences of this approximation, we next calculated the total fold change in gene expression for a promoter containing two operators when using the additive approximation versus a thermodynamic model, which incorporates the possibility of having both operators occupied simultaneously. For the additive case, the influence that each operator can be calculated using !\"#$%&\"'(!')$ !\"#!= !!!!!\"!!!!!!!! !!!!!\" !!!\"!!(!!!!!!!!)!!!!!!!!\"!!!!!!!!!!!\" !!!\"!!(!!!!!!!!)!!!!!!!\"!!!!!!!. (Equation S15) where P is the number of RNA polymerase molecules per cell, A is the number of BqsR transcription factors per cell, Ea is the binding energy of BqsR to its operator sequence, Ep is the binding energy of RNA polymerase to its promoter sequence, Ec accounts for cooperativity between BqsR and RNA polymerase, ki is the rate of transcription from state i, NNS is the number of nonspecific binding sites in the genome, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is temperature. When not using the additive approximation, we derive the transcription rate from the states and weights shown in Figure 4-\u00adS9. As can be seen in these states, the two operators have different binding energies, Ea1 and Ea2. The energy that accounts for cooperativity between BqsR and RNA polymerase is the regardless of whether operator 1, operator 2, or both operators are bound. 159 Figure 4-\u00adS9: The states and weights for a promoter containing two BqsR operators. From the weights in Figure 4-\u00adS9, we derive the transcription rate for the case of two BqsR operators to be !\"!!\"!!!(!!!!!!!!!)!!!!!\"!!\"!!!(!!!!!!!!!)!!!!!!!!!\"!!!(!!!!!!!!!!!!!)!!!. (Equation S16) 160 We calculated the ratios of transcription rates for the additive model, using Equations S14 and S15, over the full thermodynamic model, using Equation S16. The results are shown in Figure 4-\u00adS10. Figure 4-\u00adS10: The ratio of expression levels for a model which assumes operators act independently, the additive model using Equation S14, to a model which directly incorporates the states in which both operators are bound. Calculations are for a promoter containing two operators. The axes of each plot are the binding energies of the two operators. For these calculations the number of BqsR per cell was 100, the number of nonspecific binding sites was 5x106, the RNA polymerase binding energy was -\u00ad3 kBT, and the number of RNA polymerase per cell was 10,000. In these calculations we assumed the promoter escape rates, ki's, for all states were equal. In Figure 4-\u00adS10, the interaction energies range from 0 to -\u00ad10 kBT, and the operator binding energies range from 0 to -\u00ad20 kBT. We found that when both operator binding energies are strong, <-\u00ad10 kBT, the prediction using the additive model will be within a factor of two of the prediction using the full thermodynamic model whose states are listed in Figure 4-\u00adS9. For intermediate interaction energies, -\u00ad2 kBT to -\u00ad8 kBT, the additive model is close to the full thermodynamic model when one of the operators had a strong 161 binding energy and the other had a weak binding energy. The calculations with the additive model were particularly poor when both operators had very weak binding, approximately less than 5 kBT. Given that typical binding energy are -\u00ad5 to -\u00ad15 kBT, and interaction energies with RNA polymerases have been observed to be 0 to -\u00ad10 kBT, we expect calculations made for a promoter containing two operators using the additive model to be within a factor of 2 of calculations using a full thermodynamic model. Therefore the additive model is unlikely to contribute significantly to the general overestimate of expression levels observed in Figure 4-\u00ad6 of the main text. Single operator predictions Figure 4-\u00adS11: Comparison of predictions to experimental measurements of gene expression. As in Figure 4-\u00ad6 of the main text, the predictions use the BqsR binding matrices found in Figure 4-\u00ad5. Unlike in Figure 4-\u00ad6, in (A) we only use the strongest binding operator and in (B) we only use the closest operator to predict expression. All operators used contain less than 3 mutations and are found between -\u00ad1000 and 0 bases of the coding sequence. 162 Gene expression predictions taking into account operator orientation Figure 4-\u00adS12: Predictions of gene expression for the same set of genes shown in Figure 4-\u00ad6 when taking operator direction into account. The black x's replot the original predictions from Figure 4-\u00ad6B which allow the operators to be in either orientation relative to the direction of the regulated gene. The blue squares show the predictions for the same genes using only those operators that have the same orientation of the regulated gene, and the red circles show the predictions using only those operators that have the opposite orientation of the regulated gene. For some of the predicted genes, all of the operators face in the same direction; therefore, the red circles and blue squares each contain a subset of the predictions made using both orientations. Measuring gene expression in response to ferrous iron shock Figure 4-\u00adS13: (A) Cells containing a lacZ reporter attached to the promoter region of gene PA14_04180 were shocked with ferrous iron concentrations between 50 and 400 mM for either 135 m, 205 m, 265 m, or 325 m (see legend). Following the shock, expression levels 163 of lacZ were quantified using the fluorogenic indicator FDG. It was found that upon shocking with 400 mM ferrous iron, the fold change reached a maximum in less than 205 min. (B) Comparison of the gene expression measured using the FDG assay and the LacZ reporter to a YFP reporter. Measurements were performed on aerobically grown E. coli strains containing a lac operator at +11 relative to the transcription start site and the wildtype number of Lac repressors per cells (58). The four data points correspond to construct containing the O1, O2, O3, and Oid lac operator. Comparison to other operons We compare the genes experimentally found to be under BqsR control with 13 experimentally validated P. aeruginosa regulons from the literature. Most of these regulons did not significantly overlap with the BqsR regulon (see Table 4-\u00adS1). Figure 4-\u00ad7C shows the results of a few of these comparisons. For some transcription factors, the regulon was reported more than once. Two published datasets for Fur were compared to the BqsR regulon. Only one dataset significantly overlapped with the BqsR regulon (28) and the expression of all of the overlapping TUs were only marginally perturbed by Fur. Two methods for finding the PqsR regulon were used (32,33) and both regulons overlapped with TUs we predicted to be BqsR regulated but did not appear in the RNAseq data with statistical significance. Anr represses all of the genes (25) that statistically significantly overlap with predicted BqsR TUs, but did not appear in the RNAseq data. RpoN activates many of the genes (34) that we observed in the experimental data but were not predicted using our binding energy matrix, referred to as the false negatives in the main text. 164 Table 4-\u00adS1.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 108:12173-\u00ad12178. 170 Chapter V: Future Directions 171 At the beginning of this project, I had the simple question: can bacteria distinguish between extracellular Fe(II) and Fe(III)? I found not only that Pseudomonas aeruginosa specifically sensed extracellular Fe(II) through BqsRS, but gained insight into how Fe(II) affects cellular processes. In the presence of Fe(II), BqsRS provided for spermidine homeostasis and protection against cationic stressors, including aminoglycoside and polymyxin drugs used to treat cystic fibrosis patients. Furthermore, many BqsR regulated genes were consistent with the hypothesis that Fe(II) served as a proxy for reducing and acidic environments, conditions where Fe(II) is stable. Although I discovered some mechanistic details of how BqsRS functions, much remains to be elucidated. Future Experiments Metal binding experiments Previously, I determined that the RExxE motif in the periplasmic region of BqsS is critical for sensing Fe(II) in vivo (see chapter 4). In chapter 5, I construct a BqsR binding promoter-\u00adlacZ fusion and analyze the response with a fluorescent reporter. This makes experimental analysis of transcriptional response much faster than qPCR experiments. This system can be leveraged to further analyze the Fe(II)-\u00adBqsS interaction. Additionally, these types of experiments would be beneficial if BqsS proves to be too difficult to purify. First, the metal specificity can be probed further. It would be interesting to test Co(II) because it similar in size and electronic properties to Fe(II). Although I previously 172 tested the transcriptional response to 5 mM CaCl2, there has been some hints that BqsS responds to elevated Ca(II) concentrations. This includes a calcium signaling review referencing unpublished work (1) and that bqsR was approximately 2-\u00adfold repressed in a low calcium condition (2). However, the low calcium condition was induced by EGTA (2), which binds Fe(II) with a higher affinity than Ca(II), so this could be due to Fe(II) deprivation. Thus, it would be interesting to follow this literature and experimentally examine the transcriptional response to a range of Ca(II) concentrations. Furthermore, metal competition studies could be performed to assess if some metals are competitive inhibitors of the Fe(II) shock response. The Fe(II)-\u00adsensing motif could be probed in more detail. The full sequence for the Fe(II)-\u00adsensing motif is REeaE. Testing variations of the RExxE sequence identified from a phylogenic analysis (see Appendix B) would develop an understanding of the full Fe(II)-\u00adsensing potential of the observed motifs. For example, a RxExE motif is closely related to the Fe(II)-\u00adsensing motif. If RxExE could indeed bind Fe(II), then strains containing this motif are most likely Fe(II)-\u00adsensing bacteria. Additional mutations to examine include all combinations of single and double glutamate mutants. Also, changing the glutamates to aspartates should result in active Fe(II)-\u00adsensor and would serve as a positive control for the in vivo experiments (i.e. from mutants previously analyzed, it is possible that any mutation at this locus disrupts activity). Additionally E to D mutants would determine which of the D containing motif variants in the phylogenic analysis are functional Fe(II) sonsors. A more conservative substitution to generate a nonfunctional sensor would be E 173 to Q (rather than S or A used previously in chapter 3) as Q only substitutes an amino group for a carboxyl group. Also, a KExxE motif has been shown to bind Fe(II) (3), examining this change in BqsS would be interesting. The Fe(II)-\u00adsensing motif remains to be biochemically characterized. Several attempts to purify the periplasmic domain of BqsS were performed. Beyond varying the standard induction parameters (time, temperature, and inducer concentrations) to obtain soluble protein, several affinity tags (His, Strep, and glutathione) were tested. Because the definition of the periplasmic region was based on predicted transmembrane helix cut-\u00adoffs, multiple constructs were tested with slightly different edges (i.e. the total length of the periplasmic region was varied for the cut-\u00adoff of the N and C terminal residues). New approaches to purification should include examining different constructs (see table S5-\u00ad1), different expression strains, denaturing purification, or purifying the full length sensor [several similar full length sensor histidine kinases have been purified (4, 5)]. Once purified BqsS is obtained, metal binding studies could be performed with techniques such as isothermal calorimetry or differential scanning fluorimetry (6). These experiments could give the KD not only for Fe(II), but also other metals such as Co(II) and Fe(III). The results of these experiments would give insight into the mechanism of metal selectivity. If the sensor only binds Fe(II), selectivity would be achieved solely through the sensor, whereas if the sensor binds several metals with similar strength, then the selectivity could be mediated through an additional factor, perhaps BqsP or BqsQ. Other metals could bind with higher affinity than Fe(II), but lock the sensor in an inactive 174 conformation. Metal competition studies would begin to address this; furthermore, the preference for Fe(II) in a more complex context would be elucidated. Metal competition studies would also be interesting to examine in vivo. Ultimately, determining how Fe(II)-\u00adbinding would be a vast improvement over the Fe(II)-\u00adsensing experiments completed. With purified BqsS, if the Fe(II) binding is strong enough, inorganic chemistry techniques such as 57Fe-\u00adM\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy could be used to understand the ligand environment in more detail. Additionally, x-\u00adray crystallography of BqsS incubated with Fe(II) would show all residues in contact with Fe(II). Analysis of Fe(II) binding with site-\u00addirected mutant at key residues, including those in the RExxE motif, would further confirm the key Fe(II)-\u00adbinding residues. Operon characterization In P. aeruginosa PA14, the bqs operon consists of two homologous single pass transmembrane proteins (bqsP and bqsQ), the response regulator (bqsR), the sensor histidine kinase (bqsS), and a hypothetical (bqsT) (see chapter 2 for further details). It would be interesting to study the function of bqsP and bqsQ because all strains with the RExxE motif within BqsS contain at least one copy of these genes (with an e-\u00advalue < 10e-\u00ad3 and 45% identity). These have homology to PePSY-\u00adtype peptidases, which are known virulence factors (7). Also, they are homologous to YycI, a short peptide known to modulate sensor kinase activity through its transmembrane domain; the function of the periplasmic domain is unknown (8, 9). Other single-\u00adpass membrane proteins have been 175 shown to modulate secondary two-\u00adcomponent systems (10). BqsRS upregulates at least two other two-\u00adcomponent systems; BqsP or BqsQ could bridge multiple systems. Performing transcriptional analysis of bqsPQ, bqsP, and bqsQ (the first two clean deletion strains have already been made) would be interesting because it may modulate magnitude of the bqs operon expression. It would also be interesting to examine truncation mutants, both in the membrane domain and the periplasmic domain. The membrane domain may modulate the sensor's activity and the periplasmic domain could either act as a peptidase or help in Fe(II) sensing. Regulon Several BqsR regulon members would be interesting to examine in greater detail. Compared with WT, bqsR/S have a severe growth defect that increases as the Fe(II) concentration increases (Fig. 5-\u00ad1). I performed growth curves for several transposon mutants (annotation confirmed with PCR) from the PA14 transposon mutant library (11) in high Fe(II). The Fe(II) concentration required for a growth defect for most of these mutants was higher than for bqsR (Fig. 5-\u00ad1). Since there is an observable phenotype associated with these genes, they are important for growth in high Fe(II) and would be interesting targets for further experiments. 176 Figure 5-\u00ad1. High Fe(II) growth defects for BqsR-\u00adregulon members. Cultures were grown in biological triplicate anaerobically at 37 oC in MOPS minimal media supplemented with 150 177 \u00b5M Fe(II). Individual transposon mutant growth curves for PA14_07070 (A), PA14_04270 (B), and PA14_01250 (C) are shown with WT and bqsR (see chapter 3 and appendix A for methods). The mutant with the most severe growth defect in 150 \u00b5M Fe(II) is PA14_07070 and is almost as impaired 5-\u00ad1). aeruginosa, P. stutzeri, P. with the exact RExxE motif in BqsS (see Appendix B) contain a copy of this; the Kushneria strain with this motif contains a more distantly related homologue designated as ferrodoxin (E-\u00advalue a kDa predicted reductase, most likely containing a flavin (based on homology from pBLAST). This is an interesting target because in the context of high Fe(II), it most likely functions in the reverse direction oxidizing Fe(II) to Fe(III). This could serve as a defense against high Fe(II), which can be toxic anaerobically (12, 13), by effectively removing Fe from its environment, as Fe(III) is insoluble. The structure contains 6 transmembrane segments at the N-\u00adterminus with the majority of the soluble part of the protein facing the cytosol [predicted by DAS (14) and TMHMM (15)]. Purifying and verifying the Fe(II) oxidation capability of this protein would be interesting. Another gene to examine in more detail is PA14_04270, a predicted transcription factor. Pseudomonas and Azotobacter strains with the exact RExxE motif (see Appendix B) in BqsS contain a copy of this; the Kushneria aurantia strain does not (E-\u00advalue < 1E-\u00ad3). PA14_04270 is a 36.2 kDa with 1 potential transmembrane domain predicted to be in the cytoplasmic membrane by TMHMM and contains a signal sequence detected by pSORTb (16). To examine its regulon, an RNA-\u00adSeq experiment comparing a time series after Fe(II) 178 shock with the strains PA14_04270, bqsR, and WT could be used to distinguish what subset of the BqsR regulon is due to PA14_04270. Also, a time course may identify other BqsR regulated genes. With some of the PA14_04270 responsive genes identified, the consensus DNA binding motif could also be elucidated. It may also serve as mediator between different two-\u00adcomponent systems, as suggested for BqsP/Q above. PA14_01250 may also be an interesting target for further study. Pseudomonas, Azotobacter, and Kushneria aurantia strains with the exact RExxE motif in BqsS (see Appendix B) contain a copy of this (E-\u00advalue < 1E-\u00ad4). It is a 54.8 kDa, 9-\u00ad11 pass-\u00adtransmembrane protein (TMHMM, DAS) predicted by pSORTb to be in the cytoplasmic membrane. Its predicted function is a sulfate permease. The upregulation and growth defect could be due to the counter-\u00adion for Fe(II), because the Fe(II) source for most experiments has been ferrous ammonium sulfate. However, we did see it upregulated in the microarray where FeCl2 was used (see chapter 2). It would be interesting to test this expression in a variety of Fe(II) sources with a different counter ion and see if it still is upregulated. Finally, PA14_04180 did not have a large growth defect (although the anaerobic chamber was not functioning properly and I have not been able to do the growth experiment at higher Fe(II) concentrations); however it is the most strongly upregulated gene, between 3000-\u00ad6000 fold upregulated (chapters 2 and 3). Such a high level of upregulation makes this an interesting target. However, only the Azotobacter strain appears to have a homologue (E-\u00advalue < 1E-\u00ad3). The flanking genomic region on the left is 179 the polyamine permease (Pot operon) and a polyamine modification protein. From the genomic context, PA14_04180 may be binding a polyamine precursor. It has N-\u00adterminal signal sequence and contains a poorly predicted transmembrane domain (DAS, TMHMM), and could therefore be in the cytoplasmic membrane, the periplasm, or extracellular with similar probability (pSORTb). It is a relatively small protein at 12.6 kDa that is a predicted bacterial OB-\u00adfold protein (BOF). BOFs contain a binding pocket for positively charged molecules. To examine this protein further, first determining if there is a growth defect in high Fe(II) would be important. Subsequently, the localization could be determined by affinity tagging the protein on the C-\u00adterminus with a Strep-\u00adtag (to avoid metal binding with His-\u00adtag and avoid interference with N-\u00adterminal the signal sequence). After an Fe(II) shock, the cell should be fractionated and labeled with antibodies to identify where PA14_04180 expresses. Finally, the function of purified PA14_04180 could be examined by testing Fe and amine binding. If PA14_04180 does not bind Fe or amines, binding could be tested with a small molecule library and assessed with differential scanning fluorimetry (6). Phenotypes The response mediated by BqsRS could be characterized further. The modifications to LPS and membranes could be biochemically assessed because transporter systems the LPS modifying arn operon (See 180 chapter 3 for full RNA-\u00adSeq results) are upregulated. It would be interesting to see if the surface charge of P. aeruginosa does indeed become more positive upon exposure to Fe(II). Additionally, since Fe(II) may serve as an environmental proxy for acidic and reducing conditions, it would be interesting to see if members of the BqsR regulon are upregulated in those conditions without Fe(II) present. Conclusion By examining these research areas, much could be learned about Fe(II) sensing both on a biochemical level and on a physiological level. Understanding the nature of Fe(II) binding and how specificity is achieved would diversify the field of Fe chemistry because this type of Fe(II) binding is unique. A deep knowledge of how bacteria respond to their extracellular environment would allow for the development of biomarkers and therapeutic approaches to more effectively treat bacteria by targeting active processes. The BqsRS system is a good example of searching for an environmental parameter and then using laboratory techniques to find how a bacteria responds to it. 181 References 1.

I predicted regulon members and observed some associated phenotypes in high Fe(II) for the bqsR mutant including a severe growth defect, reduced spermidine production, and increased sensitivity to cationic antibiotics (chapter 3). Previously, the BqsRS two-\u00adcomponent system has been implicated in modulating biofilm dispersal and quorum sensing (1). Dong et al. discovered this two-\u00adcomponent system by noticing increased biofilm thickness in deletion mutants for this TCS (1). I have been unable to replicate this phenotype. However, Dong et al. also observed that bqsR/S produced N-\u00adbutyryl-\u00adL-\u00adhomoserine lactone (C4-\u00adHSL), PQS, (C12-\u00adHSL), RhlR/C4-\u00adHSL, and PqsR/PQS (2). One of the main products activated by the RhlR quorum sensing system was rhamnolipids (3). Rhamnolipids were associated with biofilm dispersal and swarming motility (4). Since I was unable to reproduce the biofilm phenotype for bqsR/S, I wanted to ensure that I could reproduce at least one phenotype previously observed (1). I chose to compare the rhamnolipid production in bqsR and WT strains. If the deletion mutant showed less rhamnolipid production, then the corresponding quorum sensing deficiencies would most likely occur. Furthermore, because unlike Dong et al. I knew the BqsS ligand [Fe(II)], I could examine this phenomenon in greater detail. Biofilm studies were notoriously delicate and difficult to reproduce even within the same lab, whereas 186 measures of quorum sensing molecules and rhamnolipids were more consistent and quantitative. Since Dong et al. showed less 4C-\u00adHSL in bqsR (1), there may be a difference in the BqsR regulon expression when comparing expression in stationary phase between WT and a rhlR mutant. My original intention was to compare wt, bqsR, and rhlR in both exponential (when quorum sensing is turned off) and stationary phase (when quorum sensing is turned on) to see how BqsR-\u00admediated gene expression regulation interacts with the RhlR-\u00adbased quorum sensing system. However, I found that the rhlR mutant grows much faster and to a greater density than WT and bqsR strains, making comparisons between strains impossible. Instead, I overexpressed RhlR in early exponential to compare with WT and bqsR (chapter 4). Here, I examine the rhlR mutant growth in more detail by examining growth different carbon sources and Fe conditions. Methods Growth conditions. P. aeruginosa PA14 was grown both aerobically and anaerobically at 37 oC in MOPS minimal medium (MOMM) in acid washed glassware to ensure cells were Fe limited. The basic MOMM is composed of 40 mM succinate (C4H4Na2O4 \u00b7 6H2O), 9.3 mM NH4Cl, 2.2 mM KH2PO4, 25 mM KNO3, 25 mM NaNO3, 25 mM MOPS, and 25 mM NaMOPS pH 7.2. Additionally, immediately prior to inoculation 100 \u00b5M CaCl2, 1 \u00b5M (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2 \u00b7 6H2O, 1 mM MgSO4, and trace metals were added (5). The Fe(II) 187 concentration used in each experiment is noted if at a different Fe(II) concentration. Anaerobic work was performed in a coy chamber with the 80% nitrogen, 15% carbon dioxide, and 5% hydrogen. For growth rhamnolipid extraction, cells were incubated aerobically 1 \u00b5M Fe(II) cultures ml 1 \u00b5M Fe(II) mM nitrate the acceptor inoculated with 1% overnight for wt and bqsR in quadruplicate. Growth was monitored by Beckman Spec20. For growth comparing wt, bqsR, and rhlR in Fe-\u00adlimited and Fe-\u00adreplete conditions, strains were grown as above substituting 3.6 \u00b5M Fe(II) to the overnights and anaerobic 5 ml cultures in balch tubes for the Fe-\u00adreplete condition in duplicate. Growth in various carbon sources. WT, bqsR, and rhlR strains were grown in 96-\u00adwell plates and the anaerobic BioTek Synergy 4 plate reader was used. All carbon sources were filter sterilized in 1 M stocks and added to MoMM base (prepared without a carbon-\u00adsource) at 40 mM final concentration. The carbon sources were not normalized for carbon number because the cells were grown in Fe-\u00adlimited conditions. The lack of Fe should affect growth before the concentration of carbon. The carbon sources tested were pyruvate, succinate, acetate, glucose, glutamate, and mannitol. The length of the overnights was varied so they reached the same OD at the time of anaerobic inoculation. Three replicates of overnights were grown in Fe-\u00adlimited conditions in MoMM with acetate and mannitol for 36 hours, pyruvate and glucose for 24 hours, and succinate and 188 glutamate for 16 hours. Cultures were inoculated to OD500 = 0.02 anaerobically in triplicate. Fe(II) shock for rhamnolipid extraction. Cells were harvested between OD500 = 0.77 - 0.87 and shocked with 200 \u00b5M Fe(II) at room temperature. 1 ml samples were taken after 30 min and overnight for both Fe(II) shocked cells and unshocked cells. When cells were harvested they were centrifuged at max speed for 3 min and the supernatent saved for rhamnolipid analysis. Samples were stored at -\u00ad20 C. Rhamnolipid extraction and visualization. 500 \u00b5l of the frozen supernatant rhamnolipids were thawed and extracted 3 times with an equal volume of ethyl acetate in 1.7 ml eppendorf tubes. For the ethyl acetate extraction, the aqueous and organic phases were mixed well and centrifuged in the microfuge for 30 sec to separate. The organic phase, the top layer, from each extraction were pooled and evaporated to dryness with argon in glass GC vials. Samples were resuspended in 100 \u00b5l of methanol. 5 \u00b5l of each sample and 5 \u00b5l of 0.1 mg/ml of rhamnolipid standard were spotted on TLC plates (silica 60). The running buffer was a mixture of chloroform, methanol, and acetic acid in a ratio of 65:15:2. To visualize the rhamnolipids on the TLC-\u00adplates, the plates were covered with a detection agent consisting of 0.15 g orcinol, 8.2 mL sulfuric acid (60%), and 42 mL deionized water. For preservation, dried plates were incubated at 110\u00b0C for 10 min. 189 Results Rhamnolipid analysis Previously most Fe(II) shock experiments were performed in early exponential phase, however rhamnolipids start being produced in stationary phase (3). First, to determine the optimal OD for rhamnolipid extraction, I extracted rhamnolipids at several ODs over a growth curve, which plateau between OD500 = 0.85-\u00ad 1.2. I harvested the cells at OD500 = 0.8 because the cells consistently grew to this OD and rhamnolipids show increased concentration. The closest comparison between the Dong et al. (1) rhamnolipid extraction and my rhamnolipid extraction is comparing unshocked WT and bqsR cells (Fig. A-\u00ad1). The difference between these extractions is that Dong et al. (1) performed the extraction from cells grown in aerobically LB and I performed the extraction anaerobically in MoMM. Figure A-\u00ad1 shows that without Fe(II) shock WT has more rhamnolipids than bqsR after both 30 min (Fig. A-\u00ad1A) and overnight (Fig. A-\u00ad1B) at room temperature. Unshocked WT cells with 1 \u00b5M Fe samples show slightly more rhamnolipid production when comparing the 30 min time point to the overnight time point at room temperature (Fig. A-\u00ad2A). It appears as though the overnight bqsR also has more rhamnolipids than the 30 min time point, but it is a little difficult to discern because the TLC plate ran poorly (Fig. A-\u00ad2B). 190 Figure A-\u00ad1. Comparison of rhamnolipid production for unshocked cells comparing bqsR and WT. Lanes labeled 1-\u00ad4 indicate biological replicates of that condition. A) Rhamnolipid extraction at the 30 min time point. B) Rhamnolipid extraction at the overnight time point. Figure A-\u00ad2. Comparison of rhamnolipid production for unshocked cells comparing production over time for WT(A) and bqsR (B) strains. Lanes labeled 1-\u00ad4 indicate biological replicates of that condition. Since I know that Fe(II) activates BqsR, I further consider how Fe(II) shock affects rhamnolipid production in WT and bqsR. The concentration of rhamnolipids in the samples is examined at 30 min, the length of Fe(II) shock used for qPCR analysis. 191 Overnight samples are also taken because it may take longer for the cells to produce the correct enzymes and synthesize rhamnolipids than just the first step of eliciting a transcriptional response. There is no significant difference after 30 min of Fe(II) shock in WT or bqsR (Fig. A-\u00ad3). It is difficult to discern because the TLC plate in Fig. A-\u00ad4A ran poorly, but it looks like WT incubated overnight with Fe(II) has more rhamnolipids than unshocked cells. Overnight Fe(II) shocked bqsR samples also have more rhamnolipid than bqsR without Fe shock (Fig. A-\u00ad4). Thus, bqsR has less rhamnolipid regardless of Fe(II) shock than WT, and Fe(II) shock increases rhamnolipid production in both WT and bqsR. These results indicate that there are both Fe(II) and BqsR-\u00addependent and independent factors that affect production of rhamnolipids. Figure A-\u00ad3. Comparison of rhamnolipid production comparing Fe(II) shocked to unshocked cells at the 30 min time point for WT(A) and bqsR (B) strains. No significant difference in rhamnolipid concentration was observed between the unshocked and Fe(II) shocked cells. Lanes labeled 1-\u00ad4 indicate biological replicates of that condition. 192 Figure A-\u00ad4. Comparison of rhamnolipid production comparing Fe(II) shocked to unshocked cells at the overnight time point for WT(A) and bqsR (B) strains. Lanes labeled 1-\u00ad4 indicate biological replicates of that condition. Growth in various carbon sources Once I was certain that rhamnolipids are produced, and that rhamnolipid production had a BqsR-\u00addependent mechanism, I wanted to examine how rhlR affected the BqsR regulon. I was unable to examine the differences within the BqsR-\u00adregulon comparing WT, bqsR, and rhlR strains in stationary phase because rhlR grew much faster and to a much greater density than either WT or bqsR. Additionally, anaerobic rhlR at the end of a growth curve turned a bright yellow color that fluoresced white under UV, which might be consistent with the siderophore pyoverdine production. Therefore, the difference between rhlR and WT growth may be due to rhlR's ability to obtain more Fe in the 1 \u00b5M Fe-\u00adlimited growth conditions. To test this I grew the cells in both Fe(II)-\u00adlimited [1 \u00b5M Fe(II)] and Fe(II)-\u00adreplete [3.6 \u00b5M Fe(II)]. grow to 193 a higher maximum OD in Fe(II)-\u00adreplete conditions, rhlR outpaces all other strains regardless of Fe(II) concentration (Fig. A-\u00ad5). Figure A-\u00ad5. Growth curves in MoMM with succinate as a carbon source in Fe(II)-\u00adlimited (1 \u00b5M) in dark colors and Fe(II)-\u00adreplete (3.6 \u00b5M) in pastel colors for WT, bqsR, and rhlR. To examine the rhlR growth phenomenon in more detail, cells were grown in a variety of different carbon sources that spanned a range of carbon source preferences from very preferred TCA cycle intermediates (6) to mannitol, extensively used to derepress catabolite repression (6). This phenomenon could be confined to rapid growth conditions and not observed in poor carbon sources. Because rhlR cells grew faster and denser than WT in both Fe-\u00adlimited and Fe-\u00adreplete conditions, the growth curves were performed in Fe-\u00adlimited conditions without normalization for carbon number. Figure A-\u00ad6 shows representative graphs of biological triplicates replicates for growth curves in each carbon source. While the lag phase differed between 96-\u00adwell plates grown on different 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 Fe(II) 194 days, the trends between and within carbon sources for each strain remained constant. Generally WT and bqsR grow very similarly, and rhlR grows faster and to a higher final density. Since the cells were grown in Fe-\u00adlimited conditions there is no growth defect in bqsR compared to WT growth as occurs during growth in high Fe(II) (see chapter 3). Figure A-\u00ad6. Growth curves in MoMM with different carbon sources in Fe(II)-\u00adlimited (1 \u00b5M) for WT (blue), bqsR (purple), and rhlR (red). 195 The growth curves in succinate (Fig. A-\u00ad6A) reveal that rhlR grows more quickly in exponential phase with a doubling time of 3.6 \u00b1 0.2 hours, whereas both WT and bqsR have a doubling time of 4.4 \u00b1 0.2 hours. The length of exponential phase is about twice as long for rhlR as for WT and bqsR. The maximum density between rhlR and WT/bqsR is different. rhlR achieves an OD of 0.8 whereas WT and bqsR only grow to an OD of 0.5. There is a severe die off in the rhlR strains that WT and bqsR don't seem to have. The features of the growth curves in glutamate (Fig. A-\u00ad6B) grow similarly to succinate. The WT and bqsR strains have a slightly longer doubling time than rhlR (Table A-\u00ad1). succinate doubling time rhlR 4.2 0.7 4.3 rhlR \u00b1 0.6 bqsR 7.9 \u00b1 1.3 WT 7.6 1.0 doubling rhlR \u00b1 bqsR 13.8 \u00b1 2.1 Doubling times are from 3-\u00ad6 biological replicates calculated from the period when the cells are growing exponentially. In glucose rhlR grows exponentially for much longer, about 24 hours, rather than the approximately 7 hours for WT and bqsR. The rate of exponential growth in glucose is not significantly different between strains, rather rhlR continues to grow exponentially much longer (24 hours) and the highest density is OD of 0.5-\u00ad0.6, whereas WT and bqsR grow to a maximum density of OD500 = 0.4. Interestingly, the severe death for the rhlR strain observed in the more preferred C-\u00adsources, glutamate and succinate, does not occur in growth glucose. For cells grown in acetate in Fig. A-\u00ad6 there is a large difference in final density between rhlR and the other strains, however there is a large range of final densities for bqsR and WT, which is seen in multiple trials. Similar to growth in glucose, the rate of exponential growth in acetate is not significantly different between strains, instead rhlR continues to grow in exponential phase longer. In contrast to all other carbon sources, in pyruvate there is no difference between any of the strains. In mannitol, none of the cells grow particularly well. However, the trends are more similar to glutamate and succinate, where rhlR doubles quicker (Table A-\u00ad1) and with a longer duration in exponential phase and achieves a higher final density (OD500 = 0.5). WT and bqsR only grow to an OD500 = 0.2. Unlike in the more preferred carbon sources, there was no large and immediate rhlR die-\u00adoff (Fig. A-\u00ad6). Discussion 197 Here, I have confirmed that in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 bqsR produces less rhamnolipids rhamnolipid production in both WT and bqsR; however, regardless of iron concentration WT always produces more rhamnolipids than bqsR. These results indicate that there are both Fe(II) dependent and independent factors that affect production of rhamnolipids in both strains. Multiple factors must integrate to determine the total amount of rhamnolipid produced. A more quantitative analysis is required to understand the mechanisms at play. However, this supports the hypothesis that RhlR and BqsR control a subset of overlapping genes. Intriguingly, rhlR grows longer in exponential phase and to a higher peak density compared to WT in MoMM supplemented with most carbon sources assessed. To my knowledge, no similar growth phenotype has previously been observed for rhlR. In fact, in rhlI mutant (produces the autoinducer, C4-\u00adHSL, that RhlR senses), without autoinducer supplementation (this should behave the same as a rhlR strain), had a slight growth defect anaerobically in LB + 100 \u00b5M nitrate (7). I also grew the bqsR strain in all conditions, but since Fe(II) concentrations were low, there was no significant growth differences observed between bqsR and WT. When comparing growth between different carbon sources for the WT strain, the most preferred carbon sources are succinate and glutamate followed by glucose, acetate, and mannitol. Mannitol is clearly an extremely poor substrate for P. aeruginosa. In pyruvate, WT grows to the highest final density in the shortest time. In the literature, Catabolite repression is most strongly turned on for organic acids such as succinate and acetate and amino acids (e.g., 198 glutamate) (6). Less strong catabolite repression is observed for glucose. Mannitol is the least preferred substrate; it is often used in catabolite repression studies to see when catabolite repression is completely turned off (6). Pyruvate does not exhibit catabolite repression and is used simultaneously in the presence of other carbon sources (8). rhlR grew strangely considering WT and the typical carbon source preferences observed in these experiments. While growth rates were highest for glutamate and succinate, once rhlR reached its highest density, a large population die-\u00adoff occurred. This die-\u00adoff was not apparent for any of the less preferred carbon sources. The highest density was similar for all carbon sources, except acetate and mannitol had approximately 2/3 less density. Difference in carbon number does not account for these observed differences. Previously, it has been observed that different carbon sources affect rhamnolipid production (9), perhaps this can account for some of the growth differences observed. An alternative hypothesis is since Fe(II) was limiting - these pathways require more Fe-\u00adconsumption. rhlR develops a yellow color that fluoresces under UV which might be pyoverdine. Although I initially tested growth in both 1 \u00b5M Fe(II) (Fe-\u00adlimited) and 3.6 \u00b5M Fe(II), which should be a Fe-\u00adreplete condition, perhaps higher Fe concentrations would show less of a growth difference between strains. This may account for the growth phenotype, as rhlR may obtain a larger quantity of Fe more quickly and thus may be able to grow in exponential phase longer and reach a higher final density more quickly. It would also be interesting to see how rhlR grows in high Fe(II), where bqsR has a growth defect, since BqsR and RhlR have overlapping regulons (see chapter 4). 199 200 References 1.

Santos A, Sampaio A, Vasquez G, Santa Anna L, Pereira N, Jr., Freire DG. 2002. Evaluation of different carbon and nitrogen sources in production of rhamnolipids by a strain Pseudomonas aeruginosa best known as the dominant pathogen in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Fe(II) is present at elevated concentrations within CF patient sputum and Fe(II), not Fe(III), correlates with severe lung function decline (1). Fe(II) concentrations within CF sputum have been measured approaching 300 \u00b5M Fe(II) (1). Therefore, coping with high concentrations of Fe(II) is critical for P. aeruginosa survival. In fact, deletion mutants for the Fe(II)-\u00adsensing two-\u00adcomponent system, BqsRS, have a significant growth defect in high concentrations of Fe(II) (see chapter 3). Fe(II) sensing is mediated through the RExxE Fe(II)-\u00adsensing motif in the periplasmic domain of the sensor histidine kinase, BqsS (see chapter 3). It is somewhat surprising that Fe(II) would be bound by glutamates, as they tend to prefer Fe(III) ligands. We have not biochemically verified that the RExxE motif in BqsS directly binds iron. However, a crystal structure of an unrelated soluble protein from Streptomyces reticuli, HbpS, binds Fe(II) through K/RExxE motifs (2). Examining how broadly distributed homologues for BqsS that contain the RExxE iron sensing motif, will give us insight into how common this Fe(II)-\u00adsensing strategy is. We could distinguish whether only Pseudomonas strains or most bacteria use this motif to sense Fe(II). Comparing whether pathogens and environmental strains contain a variant of the Fe(II)-\u00adbinding motif will allow us to speculate if this sensor is a pathogenicity trait. Additionally, looking at the sequence diversity of potential Fe(II)-\u00adbinding motifs will allow us to generate new hypothesis to broaden the definition of potential Fe(II)-\u00adbinding motifs. 203 The only experimentally verified Fe(II)-\u00adsensing motif is the RExxE. In P. aeruginosa PA14, the full motif is REEAE. However, several variations of this motif may also bind Fe(II). For example, replacing the glutamates with aspartate residues should generate a mutant capable of interacting with Fe(II) because aspartate has the same carboxylic acid functional group and is only one carbon shorter. Additionally, glutamate in the third position may be able to replace the function of the glutamate at the second position (i.e., RxExE). Finally, since KExxE motif has previously been shown to bind Fe(II) (2), replacement of R to K should still allow Fe(II) binding. Materials/Methods Retrieve and align homologous sequences. Using BqsS from P. aeruinosa (gi 116048575) as a query, protein BLAST (3) was used to search the nun-\u00adredundant database, excluding uncultured/environmental sample sequences, and return 500 sequences for both the full length BqsS and the periplasmic BqsS domain. The resulting sequences were aligned using MAFFT version 7 (4) using the iterative refinement method, L-\u00adINS-\u00adi. The results from MAFFT are saved in the FASTA format. To convert to a format suitable for tree construction, Seaview (5) was used to convert to PHYLIP format. For all of the programs listed above, assume the default settings were applied to input unless otherwise indicated. 204 Tree construction and visualization. A tree was generated from the PHYLIP format of the aligned sequences with the program PhyML 3.0 (6) with the data type selected as amino-\u00adacids and the sequence file as interleaved. The default substitution model and tree searching parameters were used; the branch supports were aLRT. The tree was visualized and modified in iTOL (7). I manually annotated and variants of the (REEAE in Pseudomonas aeruginosa) Fe(II)-\u00adsensing motif retrieved from BlastP. If the aligned sequence has no homology to the Fe(II)-\u00adsensing motif, white was assigned to that sequence (iTOL requires a color for all leaves in the tree). The number associated with color codes can be found on iTOL. I relabeled the leaves of the tree in iTOL, replacing the automated designators (GI number with some further information). The new leaf labels are the organism name and GI number (number only) to distinguish between multiple strains with the same name (e.g. multiple Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains). The approximately 150 sequences of the 500 retrieved sequences did not have a variant of the motif. These sequences fell in a sister clade to those that had the motif, suggesting that the motif evolved after these groups diverged. Since they were not of interest in this study they were removed from further analysis. The outgroup was defined as the clade sister to the last colored Fe(II)-\u00adbinding motif, and the tree was rooted there. Clades were compressed for those which had many representatives of the same species. 16S rRNA sequence retrieval and alignment. 16S from and NCBI. If there were multiple 16S rRNA sequences for the same strain, only one was necessary because 205 all were identical. Unfortunately, only one full 16S rRNA sequence for Azotobacter species exists (A. vinelandii DJ at 1535 bp), so I took the largest partial sequences at 1537 bp for Azotobacter sp. for Azotobacter chroococcum strain 10006. MAFFT version 7 was used with the same parameters above to align the 16S rRNA sequences and Seaview used to convert alignment to PHYLIP format. I relabeled the leaves of the tree in iTOL, replacing the automated designators with the organism name. The E. coli 16S rRNA was used as the outgroup to root the tree. Results Full length BqsS The most important result was that the RExxE Fe(II)-\u00adsensing motif was confined to the Pseudomonadaceae family. The vast majority of the strains that contained any variation of the Fe(II)-\u00adsensing motif are with the Pseudomonas genus with only 2 exceptions (Fig. B-\u00ad1). Highlighted in red in Fig. B-\u00ad1 are the other Pseudomonadaceae members, Cellvibrio and Azotobacter strains, containing a variant of the Fe(II) binding motif. In cyan (RxExE), there were many Pseudomonas strains, but also at the transition between Pseudomonas to other genus' Cellvibrio japonicus contained an RxExE and Cellvibrio sp. BR. did not have any conserved motif. The experimentally validated RExxE Fe(II)-\u00adsensing motif was confined to Pseudomonas strains, except where Azotobacter vinelandii was surrounded by Pseudomonas strains. Members of the same strain generally have the same Fe(II)-\u00adbinding motif variant. Additionally, the variants of the Fe(II)-\u00adsensing motif clustered together without many gaps, e.g., the motif RxDxE or RxExD (shown in 206 dark yellow) cluster together. The motifs where the Fe(II) binding capability is the most uncertain [RxDxE or RxExD (dark yellow)] are also the furthest branching clades from the known Fe(II)-\u00adsensing motif RExxE motif (blue). Figure B-\u00ad1. The BqsS tree all sequences containing an Fe(II)-\u00adbinding motif with strains without a motif collapsed into the outgroup, where the tree was rooted. The color indicates the variant of the Fe(II)-\u00adsensing motif: blue is RExxE, cyan is RxExE, RxDxE or RxExD, cyan is KxExE, light green is KxDxE or KxExD, and navy is RDxxE or RExxD. The organisms with red text are collapsed clades. The fraction immediately following the strain name is the number of the named strain in that clade out of the total number of strains within the clade. The fraction outside of the color strip indicates the number of strains within the clade that contain the corresponding Fe(II)-\u00adbinding motif out of the total number of strains within the collapsed clade. The scale bar represents 0.1 substitutions per site. 16s Because it was unusual to observe a species clustering in the middle of different one (the Azotobacter strain surrounded by Pseudomonas strains) and that out of 2 Cellvibrio strains found on the tree only one contained an Fe(II)-\u00adsensing motif, a 16s tree was constructed with multiple Pseudomonas, Cellvibrio, and Azotobacter sequences (Fig. B-\u00ad2). One possible explanation for the Azotobacter strain that appeared surrounded by many Pseudomonas sequences is that the Azotobacter was misannotated. The potentially misannotated sequence could actually be a Pseudomonas sequence. The Azotobacter strains clustered although they branched within the clade that contains Pseudomonas psychrotolerans L19. Therefore, they were more closely related to Pseudomonas. However, misannotation of Azotobacter cannot be ruled out because the Azotobacter vinelandii strain was the only complete sequence; alignments with partial sequences are not conclusive. The Cellvibrio strains clustered together and are clearly more distantly related to Pseudomonas. The Pseudomonas strains clustered together. !\"!#$%&'()*&'*+,&-.*,%/)\",01#2,%34%/)\",56#7889%(3:-;-<+%,=)-/(>(<%,9?189%(3:-;-<+%,%@)*<>+(,=A\",/-;+/-,%/)\",BCD!!!9%(3:-;-<+%,%/3/E()*9%(3:-;-<+%,=%@&')-/-.()+<%,F#GHE-/-4+&/(),&')--&-&&3;,%/)+*<,#!!!7HE-/-4+&/(),%=\",HE#8HE-/-4+&/(),A*<(.+<:**,BI9%(3:-;-<+%,J<+&J;3%%**,K#D9%(3:-;-<+%,+()3>*<-%+,LCK9919H#M9%(3:-;-<+%,)(%*<-A-)+<%,NKOC,#!788DC(..A*4)*-,P+=-<*&3%,L(:+#!QC(..A*4)*-,%=\",KO 208 Figure B-\u00ad2.

Periplasmic region of BqsS The predicted periplasmic region of BqsS was examined in an attempt to capture more sequence diversity, perhaps pull out Fe(II) binding proteins that weren't two-\u00adcomponent sensor histidine kinases. However, the BLAST results were all two-\u00adcomponent systems. These results are very similar to the full length BqsS phylogenetic alignments, the only difference being that the Azotobacter is on the edge of the true RExxE motifs rather than in the middle of them (which makes more sense phylogenetically). But essentially both BLAST results show that the RExxE motif is restricted to within Pseudomonas strains and that similar Fe(II)-\u00adbinding motifs cluster together. In fact, in this tree similar Fe(II)-\u00adbinding motifs cluster together more tightly than the full length sensor tree (i.e., there is more distance between branches with different Fe(II)-\u00adbinding motif variants). 209 Figure B-\u00ad3.

The organisms with red text are the most distantly related phylogenetically. Triangles represent collapsed clades. The fraction immediately following the strain name is the number of the named strain in that clade out of the total number of strains within the clade. The fraction outside of the color strip indicates the number of strains within the clade out of the total number of strains within the collapsed clade. The scale bar represents 0.1 substitutions per site. Discussion The RExxE Fe(II)-\u00adsensing motif both in the full length and the periplasmic domain BqsS alignment is confined to the Pseudomonadaceae family, with the vast majority of the sequences within the Pseudomonas genus. The same species clustered together as well as species within the same group (Fig. B-\u00ad2). Sequences containing the same motif variant clustered together. The vast majority of the strains contain an R rather than an L as the first base. Arginine may be preferred because although Arg is highly positively charged, an Arg-\u00adArg interaction could stabilize Fe(II) binding and BqsS dimerization rather than act as a repulsive force. Increased dimerization and Fe-\u00adbinding stability could be mediated through the guinidinium moity of each Arg participating in pi stacking interactions. Other proteins use this strategy (9) to stabilize interactions between domains. Only the RExxE motif has experimentally verified Fe(II) sensing capability. The other potential Fe(II)-\u00adbinding motifs should be verified both in the in vivo system used in Chapter 3 and biochemically with purified sensor (full length or periplasmic domain). Additionally, each glutamate should be individually mutated to see how each position contributes to Fe(II) binding. Furthermore, the sequence alignments of the experimentally validated Fe(II) sensing variants could be analyzed for other conserved residues in the periplasmic region to potentially reveal other residues critical for Fe(II) binding. For 211 example, in the Salmonella Fe(III) sensor histidine kinase, PmrB, a distal serine residue is also important for Fe(III) sensing (10). Fe(II) sensing is not associated with pathogenicity because the motif occurs in a variety of pseudomonas strains. For example, the experimentally verified, RExxE motif is found in the human pathogenic species P. aeruginosa as well as the soil bacterium P. stutzeri. Other variants of the motif were found in the plant pathogenic species P. syringae as well as the typically non-\u00adpathogenic P. fluorescens. The Fe(II)-\u00adbinding motif may have first evolved in soil because soils can frequently become anoxic (11) and soil environments can contain micromolar concentrations of Fe(II) (12). Unlike in the CF lung, where human immune systems are striving to limit free Fe (13), Fe in soil is more mobile (14). This hypothesis is supported by the phylogenetic result that Fe(II)-\u00adbinding motifs are associated with pathogenic and non-\u00adpathogenic strains of Pseudomonas. To obtain a greater diversity of organism with this type of Fe(II) sensing, metagenomes from environmental samples rich in Fe(II) such as acid mine drainage microbial communities (15) should be examined. 212 References 1.
