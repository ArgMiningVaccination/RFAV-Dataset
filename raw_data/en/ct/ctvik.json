Our treatment approach reflects fundamental principles of integrative medicine and has been enriched through ongoing c onversation and exchange with conventional colleagues. As a result, JMBCIM is an active member of Jefferson's NCI designated Kimmel Cancer Center. The following sections feature biological therapies employed in integrative cancer treatment. These include the use of nutraceuticals (micronutrients and botanical me dicines) as well as selected pharmacological agents. However, we want to pref ace this discussion with a brief summary of our overall approach to the cancer patient. Our core approach to treating cancer is to care for each individual patient, and support his or her vitality in a comprehensive way. Nutrition, lifestyle ch ange, mind-body skills, constitutional treatments, and psychospiritual support are all essen tial features of our program. Graphi cally this can be Lifestyle Diet Vitality Page 2 February 2006 Diet. We promote dietary strategies that are gene rally health promoting: phytonutrient rich, anti- inflammatory, and low-glycemic. We eliminate food a llergies and intole rances. We direct patients to learn more about therapeutic diets such as macrobiotics and raw-foods. Lifestyle. We counsel patients to examine their lifestyl e and make necessary changes to support healing. We emphasize healthy rhythm s of activity and rest. Mind-body therapies and psychospiritual support. Patients are encouraged to cultivate self- regulation through mindfulness-ba sed stress reduction classe s or tutorials. We refe r frequently to health psychologists and other mind-body pr actitioners for emotional suppor t and creative self-expression. Constitutional therapies. Many complementary therapies treat a patient's overall constitution, bringing greater balance, harmony, integrity and resilience to the individua l's body-mind-spirit ecology. At our Center they include: acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medici ne, homeopathy, massage therapy, Anthroposophical medicine, and We stern botanical medicine. Nutraceuticals and other biological agents .

Historical Considerations The last two decades of the twentieth century saw th e development of the field of integrative medicine. This discipline developed out of a co re of basic needs and opportunities: 1. Important gaps in the conventional appro ach to health and illness have been acknowledged. The value of integrating comple mentary therapies to fill some of these gaps is increasingly recognized. 2. There is interest to extend past conven tional evidence boundaries, such as randomized, double blind studies. Patients with illnesse s inadequately addr essed by conventional treatments have become willing and interest ed in exploring treatment methods not as strongly validated by these criteria, but likel y to be safe. Many of these treatments involve natural substances, such as herbs, th at have a long pattern of historical use in traditional medical approaches from other cultures, such as Traditional Chinese Medicine, Ayurveda, and the folk medicines of indigenous peoples. 3. Patients want to share responsibility a nd decision making with their health care practitioners for treatment a pproaches that they can help control and choose. Diet, exercise, mind-body methods, and the use of read ily available, appropriately regulated, and apparently safe substances, such as vi tamins, minerals and herbs, became very attractive and widely used. Historically, practitioners of inte grative medicine have tended to a ddress particular types of medical situations. These include (a) preventive medicine, (b) illnesses with a self-limiting course, such as viral and mild bacterial infections lik e otitis media, and (c) illnesse s and symptoms where conventional diagnostic and treatment options are very limited. These latter illnesses are extremely prevalent, and include chronic fatigue, fibromyalg ia and other chronic pain cond itions, irritable bowel, menstrual dysfunction and other \"functional\" illnesse s, and environmental and food allergies. Most patients with malignancies, particularly in situations where conventional options are limited and potentially more toxic, also search for other treatment options. There have been few \"alternative\" approaches to cancer treatment that had any level of scientific validity, and treatments were either taken from traditional, historical usage, or their effects were described in quasi-scientific terms such as their ability to \"strengthen the immune system.\" However, two interrelated developments have led to the present practice of \"Integrative Oncology,\" which is more scientifically based, and can with justificati on be described as trul y integrative with, as opposed to \"alternative\" to conventio nal. The first of these developm ents has been the considerable scientific interest in studying natu ral substances, such as herbs and vitamins, as well as documenting the effects of psychological processes like meditation. The second deve lopment has been the deepening scientific understanding of malignancies, leading to the grow ing understanding of processes such as signal transduction, cellular transformation, and the subsequent deve lopment of targeted therapies. As science has begun to unveil the biologi cal basis of malignant processes like angiogenesis and apoptosis, it has also been discovered that many natural substances have eff ects on these processes. As an example, a substance such as genistein (an isoflavone present in soy foods) has the ability to act as a weak estrogen agonist, as well as down-regulating various signal tran sduction pathways (such as NFkB) which are commonly up-regulated in malignant conditi ons (1,2). These are obvious biological attributes that can be of potential importance in the treatment of malignancies. Another of many examples, is that Page 4 February 2006 Vitamins A and D have been shown to have the effect (by coupling to nuclear receptors which subsequently effect specific genes) of stimulati ng normal cellular differentiation processes in cancer cells (3,4). There is a considerable scientific base describing the effect of many of thes e natural substances in various research settings, including in vitro, in vivo, and animal studies. There is also a small, but growing body of literature describing th eir effects in relevant clinical situations. Vitamin D has received considerable attention with it's multipl e anti-cancer effects (an increase in G 0/G1 arrest of cellular reproduction, induction of apoptosis and differentiation, and modulation of expression of growth factor receptors, as well as important effects on cell differe ntiation ) (3). The clinical use of Vitamin D in cancer raises concern regarding adverse reactions when high doses are used (such as hypercalcemia), therefore there continues to be grea t interest in developing vitamin D analogs, as well as different dosing regimens. For example, clinical studies on patients with hormone resistant prostate cancer [see Integrative Approach to Prostate Cancer ] have compared the use of do cetaxol with or without high weekly doses of calcitriol (1-25 OH Vitamin D), with encouraging results and minimal toxicity. (5,6). The investigation of vitamins, herbs and related subs tances in these settings is growing and offers considerable promise. The scientific basis for the use of these substanc es and methods, however, remains quite limited and of variable strength, depending on wh ich substances are being used. Th e ethical judgment regarding the use of these incompletely validated methods is ther efore open to debate. There are some circumstances where the physician should clearly be very reluctan t to introduce them into the treatment protocol. These are clinical situations when the degree of success of the convent ional approach is very high, and we would want to limit any interven tion that might adversely impact this success. On the other side, there are those situati ons, unfortunately too common, where th e conventional treatment options are minimal, non existent, or potentially very toxic. The choice to consider a treatment that has some rational chance of benefit and is very likely non toxic may be more justified. There are innumerable clinical situations that fall in between these two extremes. In addition to the potential effi cacy against the tumor itself, there are also considerations regarding ameliorating the adverse effects of many conventiona l treatments. Some treatments appear clearly warranted even if minimally studied, such as the us e of massage and relaxation therapy in conjunction with surgery. Others are more controversial, such as the use of high doses of antioxidants concurrent with patients receiving chemotherapy or radiation ther apy. There is some theoretic al basis to suspect that antioxidants, though they might limit adverse reactions to chemotherapy or radiation therapy, might also limit their effectiveness. Clinical studies though, are mixed in confir ming these theoretical concerns (7,8,9,10). These decisions, from an ethical persp ective, require choices to be made from the practitioner and informed patient. With the above as a background, here is described a generic approach of the integrative physician to integrative oncology (particularly as practiced at the Jefferson Myrna Brind Center for Integrative Medicine at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia). More detailed discussions on specific cancer types, as well as specific treatments, follow in later sections. B. Guiding Principles Page 5 February 2006 B-1. Synergism Most malignancies appear to be very comple x, with multiple biological factors supporting proliferation, local and metastatic spread. These include processes su ch as growth factor stimulation, resistance to apoptosis, a local chronic inflammato ry milieu, breakdown of loca l, limiting extracellular tissue, resistance to immune rec ognition and destruction, and enha nced angiogenesis. Conventional treatment approaches have responded to this comple xity with treatments that employ multiple agents with different modes of action. With the advent of targeted therapy, new agents have begun to be combined with older treatment protocols. While th e targeted therapy might address specific growth factors, or the process of angioge nesis, the older chemotherapeutic agents most often affect the cell cycle, by blocking certain key steps. It has been recognized that if onl y one door is blocked, cancer cells will often escape through another exit that hasn't been addressed. Therefore many escape mechanisms are addressed in the treatment protocol. The same general approach is employed in integr ative oncology, yet more so as it is likely that single interventions are not power ful or effective by themselves, but can develop efficacy when combined with other agents, either natural or conv entional. There are numerous studies supporting this synergistic effect (6,7,11,12). The integrative approach therefore targets vari ous relevant pathophysiological processes (such as resistance to apoptosis, chronic inflammation, angiogenesis) simultane ously. It also commonly uses different agents synergistically to address each of these processes. For instance, when addressing chronic inflammation, a protocol em ploying marine oils, herbs which ar e known to inhibit inflammatory pathways, and antioxidants are commonly used together. Many of these natural substances ( as well as some conventional medications ), have been shown to have multiple effects, as noted above in describing Vitamin D, and equally applied to other substances. Melatonin has significant antioxi dant, cell cycle, proapoptotic, immune modulating, and signal transduction effects (13). Mushroom preparations have a wide range of ove rlapping capacities (14). Therefore, in using a multiagent protocol, with agents that by themselves have a wide range of effects, we are attempting to target numerous essential pathophysiolo gical processes. A caveat is that, in our present state of knowledge , we are relatively ignorant of how such agents interact when combined in these ways. The antici pated synergism, while part ly studied in specific instances, has not been studied or evaluated in all the comple x regimens that are commonly recommended. B-2. Anti-Inflammation The milieu surrounding malignant cells has a chronic in flammatory character. Measurement of various proinflammatory substances (such as COX 2 enzyme s, proinflammatory prostaglandins, and signaling agents such as NFkB) shows increased concentra tion (15,16). The presence of inflammation has the effect of promoting cancer growth and spread. C oussens has described: \"T he protumor actions of inflammatory cells include releasing growth a nd survival factors, promoting angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, stimulating DNA damage, remodeling the extracellular matrix to facilitate invasion, coating tumor cells to make available receptors fo r disseminating cells via lymphatics and capillaries, and evading host defence mechanisms\" (16). Page 6 February 2006 The approach to counter chr onic inflammation includes diet , various supplements, and occasionally prescription medications. An anti-infl ammatory diet is one which emphasizes omega-3 fatty acids (found especially in fish and to a lesse r extent whole grains), and limits arachidonic acid- containing foods (meat and dairy), an d includes anti-inflammatory spices such as ginger and turmeric. This dietary approach leads to the formation of anti-inflammatory pros taglandins and eicosanoids. In addition, high antioxidant and fl avonoid foods (fruits and vegeta bles) are favored, whereas toxin producing food preparation processes (p rocessing, additives, deep frying) are discouraged. In practical terms, this whole food diet is ri ch in varied vegetables and fruits, with an ample amount of fish, especially oily fish like salmon, herring, sardines (and to a lesser degree, because of mercury toxicity concerns, tuna), as well as lower am ounts of dairy and especially red meat. Dietary supplements include (a) fish and flax oils (containing omega-3 fatty acids), (b) anti- inflammatory herbs such as curcumin (curry) a nd boswellia (frankincense). Antioxidants counter inflammation and include vitamins like C in modera te doses, as well as plants such as grapeseed (containing pycnogenol), and green or red tea concentrates. Attempts to block multiple inflammatory pathways, such as those involving COX and leukotrienes is encouraged, since if only one pathway is blocked, substances w ill then use an alternate pathway (17). The supplements mentioned above can have dual COX/LOX inhi bitory properties, as opposed to the sole use of pure COX and LOX inhibito rs such as celecoxib a nd zileuton. In highly inflammatory states, these prescr iption medications may be consider ed along with the broader but less potent acting supplements (although recent informati on regarding potential negative cardiovascular consequences with COX-2 inhibitors, albeit in complete, needs to be strongly considered). Various lab tests, such as high sensitivity CRP a nd fibrinogen give general indications of the overall degree of inflammation and can help guide treatme nt intensity (18,19), although in practice, these measurements are often too non specific. Better lab te sts, which would help m onitor response to these measures, have not been ade quately identified to date. i. In Depth: Use of Fatty Acids in Malignancies B-3. Anti-Angiogenesis It is widely recognized that a ngiogenesis is an important fact or in almost all tumor types, including solid and probably most hematological malignancies. A ngiogenesis is a complex process, involving the tumor cell and the microenvironment, as well as vascular endothelial cells. The most successful antiangiogenic treatment would involve many ag ents that target numerous factors, such as the endothelial cells directly, as we ll as growth factors produced by th e tumor and the microenvironment which stimulate the endothelial cells to form new bl ood vessels (20,21). There are also suggestions that angiogenesis treatment might potentiate chemot herapy and overcome chemotherapy resistance, by improving medication delivery through normali zation of the tumor vasculature (22). However, there is also the possi bility that angiogenesis treatmen t may diminish the efficacy of chemotherapy because angiogenesis inhibitors might slow the growth of malignant cells, which could interfere with chemotherapeutic agents that target cel ls which are in an active growth cycle. It is also possible that anti-angiogenic trea tment may reduce drug delivery through abnormal, tumor vasculature. Page 7 February 2006 In the real life clinical situ ation, it is somewhat artificial to characterize the pathophysiological situations of angiogenesis, inflammation and apoptosi s as distinct, separate processes, as they are intimately related. Chronic inflammation produces vari ous growth promoting subs tances that stimulate angiogenesis, and blocking angiogene sis can lead to apoptosis. Ther efore the clinical approach to chronic inflammation, as discussed a bove, can have indirect beneficial effects in limiting angiogenesis. The integrative medicine approach to angiogene sis involves an attempt to block numerous steps in the process, both directly and indirectly. An agent of considerable interest is ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (TM), which functions primarily as a copper chelating agen t, lowering the amount of copper available. As opposed to agents such as anti-VEGF antibodies, TM has multiple and wide ranging effects on angiogenesis. Copper has an im portant role in many processes that stimulate angiogenesis, including the producti on and delivery of various growth factors, including VEGF, as well as effecting signaling molecu les such as NFkB (23,24). TM has been studied as a single agent and also in combination with standard agents (25,26,27). There are various cautions and limitations in regard to its use in clin ical practice: First, it is considered an unapproved, experimental agent by the FDA. Second, although only a fraction of the cost of approved drugs such as bevacizumab, it is not covere d by insurance. Third, the therapeutic window for copper levels is narrow. Reversible myelosuppre ssion may occur should copper levels fall below the target range; this requires careful and frequent mo nitoring of blood cell counts and ceruloplasmin levels. Clinicians have reportedly utiliz ed TM in various clinical situati ons, such as patients with a first recurrence, as well as with more advanced metastatic disease. It has also been used in patients with no measurable disease who are either at high risk for recurrence or have rising tumor markers Various vitamins, most specifically Vitamin D, Vitamin E (notably Vitamin E succinate) (28,29,30), Vitamin B6 (31,32), and Vitami n C (33), have been demonstrat ed to have inhibiting effects on angiogenesis. Numerous other natural medicati ons, such as the coriolus mushroom, which is primarily used for its effects on im mune function, also have benefi cial effects on angiogenesis (34). a. In Depth: Medicinal Mushrooms B-4. Antioxidants and Detoxification The rationale behind the use of an tioxidants and detoxifying agents is addressed in two parts. The first section discusses their use when the patient is not receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy. The second section discusses their use when patients are receiving these therapies. Antioxidants and detoxifying agents protect the body against the effects of free radicals and other substances which produce toxic eff ects, such as xenobiotics. Thes e therapeutic agents have other effects, however, which should be considered. They have beneficial effect s on countering inflammation and immunosuppression, deleterious processes which are very prevalent in patients with malignancies (35,36). It is well known that patients with malignanc ies have an increased level of inflammation and oxidative stress, as well as a defi ciency of protective a nd detoxifying subs tances such as glutathione (37,38). The presence of free radicals can also directly effect DNA and foster further mutations in malignant cells alrea dy prone to free radical damage. Ot her antioxidants, such as Vitamin A, have additional effects, such as promoting normal cell differentiation. Page 8 February 2006 An integrative treatment program involves th e use of multiple antioxidants and detoxifying agents, rather than one or two. Various studies look ing at antioxidants and cance r have examined the use of only a few agents, and have shown inconclusive or even negative effects (as with synthetic beta- carotene only in the CARET trial)(39). It has subsequently b een realized that the particular physiological conditions in this trial led to beta-carotene functioning as a prooxidant , and to a depletion of protective detoxifying agents (40). Since the hypothesis in this trial was that malignancies would increase as the level of free radicals increase, it was a positive trial, as the particular protocol of beta-carotene administration led to an increase, rath er than the expected decrease, of free radicals. This is the opposite of the message that most physicians have gotten from this trial, that the use of isolated antioxidants, particularly beta-carotene, is dele terious. It is inappropriate to ex trapolate these negative results to a situation where multiple antioxidants and detoxifying ag ents were being used simultaneously, such as in a typical integrative treatment prot ocol. The goal is developing a prot ocol where the net effect is an improved antioxidant status and impr oved detoxification, the opposite of what occurred in the CARET trial. An integrative program involves the combined use of micronutrient an tioxidants, as found in high potency multivitamins, plant based antioxidan ts (such as pycnogenol from grape leaves), and substances such as melatonin in supraphysiological doses. Melatonin in particul ar has been studied in conjunction with conventional treatment protocols. Patients with a range of advanced metastatic solid tumors were treated with chemotherapy with or without melatonin, and the active treatment group was shown to have very significantly decreased toxicity, as well as im proved regression and survival rates (41). The use of antioxidants concurrent with chemotherapy or radiation therapy remains a controversial topic. Most oncologis ts advise their patients not to us e significant doses of antioxidants while receiving these therapies. This recommen dation is based on the understanding that certain chemotherapeutic agents, most particularly alkyla ting agents, tumor antibiotics, and platinum based compounds, as well as radiation ther apy, exert some of their cytotoxi c effects through the formation of free radicals. It is therefore theoretically felt that antioxidants can interfer e with these effects. It should be understood though, that there is basi cally no clinical literature, and a paucity of in vitro studies that support this position. The literature that is available supports th e opposite position, that the use of antioxidants decreases potent side effects of chemot herapy and might actually increase the efficacy of chemotherapy and radiation therapy (42). Ther e is, however, one specific detoxifying agent, glutathione, and related substances such as n-acetyl cysteine and li poic acid, which are very likely to decrease chemotherapy efficacy and promote resistan ce (43,44). These agents should always be omitted when chemotherapy or radiation therapy is being used. Of interest is that othe r substances, most notably Vitamin C, leads to depletion of glutathione in ca ncer cells (45). Numerous studies show synergistic benefit when vitamin C is combined with chemothe rapy or radiation therapy (46,47). The mechanism of depleting glutathione in malignant cells may account for this seeming beneficial effect. When Vitamin C, bypassing the limitations of absorption through the ga strointestinal tract, is given in very high doses intravenously, dramatically higher leve ls are able to be attained, and a prooxidant effect occurs (48). The combination of attaining highe r blood levels, which are potentia lly cytotoxic (49), production of free radicals, and depletion of glut athione, suggests the potential that intravenous administration of high doses of Vitamin C augments the effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The decision to use or omit antioxidants (which as noted above have other beneficial effects on inflammation, immune function and differentiation) when patients are receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy is therefore a difficult, and ultimately, indivi dual one. In situations where conventional treatment is known to be very effective, we should clearly be very cautious in the use of Page 9 February 2006 antioxidants. In situations where conventional treatment offers little benefit, the use of antioxidants as an active treatment method may be more strongly considered for their pal liative, and potentially adjunctive treatment effects. In all the situations in be tween, the physicians and the patient will need to make their individual decisions. Although the use of antioxidants with chemo/radiat ion therapy is controve rsial, the use of anti- inflammatory substances concurrent with chemo/radi ation therapy is widely supported in the literature (50-57). The use of chemotherapy evokes an incr eased production of the signaling molecule, NFkB, which fosters chemo-resistance. Many anti-inflammato ry herbs, such as curcumin and milk thistle, block this production of NFkB, and appear to increase efficacy of nu merous chemotherapeutic agents. B-5. Cellular Re-Differentiation In general, cells that are less di fferentiated have a greater tendency to proliferation. This effect is most clearly seen with embryonal ce lls, and especially stem cells. As cells mature, they become more differentiated into specific cell types, with a conse quent significant decrease in proliferative ability. Cancer cells tend to regress to a less differentiated phenotype. Those cells that are the least differentiated tend to show greater ma lignant properties. This appearan ce is evident in the pathological description of cancer cells, often described on a range of well differe ntiated to poorly differentiated or anaplastic. These processes of differentia tion are significantly unde r genetic control. Vitamins A and D, as well as the class of hypoglycemic agents known as the glitazones effect specific nuclear receptors (RAR, RXR, VDR and PPA R), which induce differentiation. These agents also have other beneficial effects. Vitamin D, fo r instance, has the ability to (a) induce differentiation, (b) induce apoptosis, (c) induce the activity of the tumor suppr essors p21 or p27, (d) inhibit angiogenesis, and (e) inhibit cell mi gration (56). The use of these agen ts has been limited by toxicity, such as hypercalcemia with high doses of Vitamin D. There is active research investigating different forms and dosing schedules of these agents (59,60). Another potential way to conserve efficacy and re duce toxicity is to use these agents together, inducing synergistic effects. Th is would potentially allow lowe r doses to be employed. These substances are known to work synergistically (61, 62). Studies on single agent efficacy have shown no, or only mild efficacy (63,64). Vitamin D, as calcitrio l, given in high weekly oral doses in combination with docetaxel, has shown benefit in prostate ca ncer patient with androg en independent tumors, compared to historical controls (65). A phase 3, placebo controlled tr ial on the use of calcitriol with docetaxel has recently shown improved results compared to docetaxel alone (66) These differentiating agents have not been studied, however , in a potentially synergistic combination of agents, in the context of an integrated treatment protocol. These agents have actions in addition to inducing cellu lar differentiation. Retinoids, such as the forms found in foods and supplements (retinyl ester su ch as retinyl palmitate), 9 and 13 cis retinoic acid, as well as pharmacological forms such as all trans retinoic acid (ATRA), exert their effects through the transcription of a variety of gene s critical to cellular pr oliferation and differentiation. These vitamins have also been shown to promote apoptosis and ce ll cycle arrest through degr adation of stimulatory proteins. This degradation occurs through the pa thway (64), known as proteosome inhibition. PPAR agonists have also been shown to have numerous relevant clinical effects besides differentiation, including inhibition of NFkB, proapoptotic, antip roliferative, and antiangiogenetic actions. Page 10 February 2006 A synergistic program of differentiating agents would vary, depending on the specific clinical situation. Short term use would employ much hi gher doses than ongoing maintenance treatment. Appropriate monitoring of levels of retinol, 25 OH and 1-25 OH Vitamin D, liver enzymes, calcium and glucose is essential. Potential oxicity, especially with the fat soluble vitamins A and D, are important considerations. The dosages of vitamin A are likely to be very depende nt on the length of the course of treatment. Most physicians prescribe Vitamin D in doses far below the optimal range, typically in doses of 400-800 i.u./day. Significant literature sugges ts that doses as high as 4000 i.u./ day are very safe. Nevertheless, high doses can potentially induce hypercalcemia. Ther efore monitoring should be regularly performed. It should be noted that most la boratories report no rmal ranges of Vitamin D which are probably significantly lower than the optimal levels. On e should aim for a range of 50-100 ng/ml, or 100-180 mmol/liter. The use of PPAR agonist s involves at present mainly prescription medications primarily used for diabetics, the glitazones. In addition to the synergistic effects noted between these three groups of agents, numerous other substances, including antioxidants an d anti-inflammatory agents, have been shown to increase their benefits. Therefore the use of diffe rentiation agents should be combined with the general integrative treatment protocol outlined elsewhere. a. In Depth: Agents Promoting Cellular Differentiation B-6. Immune Modulation \" Alternative\" approaches to malignancies ofte n base themselves on \"stimulating the immune system\". As with all such generic statements, the issue is much more complex, and incompletely understood. It is widely thought th at there exists an innate imm une surveillance system, whereby nascent malignant cells are recognized by the immune system, and destroyed before they have a chance to grow and become established. It is also widely thought that th e immune system, if appropriately activated and directed, can be a potent ally in the fight to eradicate alread y established cancers, or prevent their recurrence once a patient undergoe s surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Conventional attempts to enlist the help of the immune system in th e treatment of malignancies have included general stimulation such as occurs with BCG, the use of cytokines such as interferon or interleukin (usually in high doses), monoclonal anti bodies such as rituximab, and vaccines. In patients with malignancies, it is recognized that certain deficienci es exist, such as defective maturation of dendritic cells, which are essential for the presen tation of the tumor antigens to the immune system (65,67). It is also recognized that other factors, such as the presence of reactive oxygen species, or inflammation, can play a role in the suppression of the immune response, and help the tumor escape the effects of this response (68,69). I nvestigation in these areas is ve ry active and appears promising. Various natural substances have direct eff ects on immune processes. The most well known examples are medicinal mushrooms, which are used very widely in Asia, and mistletoe preparations, which are used widely in Europe. A preparati on made from the Coriolus mushroom, called PSK (polysaccharide Krestin) has been shown to positively effect dendr itic cell maturation, as well as stimulate NK and LAK function (70,71) . Various potentially beneficial immune effects have also been noted with Mistletoe (71,72). These agents have also been studied in clinical settings. Coriolus preparations have been studied in numerous gastroin testinal malignancies, with statistically positive Page 11 February 2006 results (73,74,75). Mistletoe has likewise been studied in various clinical sett ings, with unclear but potentially beneficial effects (76,77). In the context of the known immune defects in patients with malignancies, it has become routine in most integrative treatment prot ocols to include an immune active agent, such as the mushroom or mistletoe preparations discussed above. These tr eatments are done, as always, in the context of the comprehensive protocol. The inclusion of antioxidant s and anti-inflammatory preparations is likely to have further potentially benefici al effects on immune functioning. There are certain caveats and exceptions to the inclusion of these immune active ag ents. This caveat is particularly true with hematological malignancies. These malignancies, su ch as lymphomas, typically involve immune active cells, such as B or T lymphocytes. As substanc es like mushrooms and mis tletoe have effects on a multitude of immune active cells and functions, there is the potential concern that the use of these substances could inadvertently stimulate malignant cells. i In Depth: Medicinal Mushrooms ii .In Depth: European Mistletoe B-7. Apoptosis The induction of apoptosis, or programmed cell deat h, stands side by side with the inhibition of increased cell proliferation, as a vita l therapeutic goal in the treatment of malignancies. Apoptosis is a common final pathway for dying cells, and therefore is effected in multiple ways. Many cancer cells, through the upregulation of the gene BCl-2, resist apoptosis. This resistance has numerous consequences. The resistance to apoptosis allows da maged and mutated cells to survive, and ultimately proliferate. It also prolongs the lifespan of cells, and makes them more likely to develop mutations. It also helps resist the cyto toxic action of various agents, such as chemotherapy. It can change the effect of a cytotoxic agent into one of cy tostasis. The normalization of all of the above mentioned functions, such as antiangiogenesis, decreasing inflammati on and strengthening immune function, lead to apoptosis. Most chemotherapeutic drugs induce apoptosis. There ar e, in addition, specific natural substances which have been noted fo r their ability to induce apoptosis. Vitamin E succinate has been shown to increas e the expression of Fas protein, and decrease PCNA protein on gastric carcinoma cells in a dose depe ndent manner (78). The presence or absence of these proteins, respectively, is a ssociated with the tendency to a poptosis. Another study showed its effects were related to BCl-2 (79). An in vivo study of immunocompromised mice with malignant mesothelioma being treated with Vitamin E succinate , showed a significant e ffect on survival (80). There is however, considerable doubt regarding th e ability of Vitamin E succinate to survive the proteolytic activity in the GI tract. The above mentioned studies were in cell culture. Green tea, and polyphenols found in green and red tea such as epigalloca techin gallate (ECGC), have also demonstrated the ability to induce apoptosis (81,82). Direct effects on BCl-2 proteins have been shown (83). There are numerous green an red t ea concentrates available commercially which allow the administration of the equivalent amount of ECGC found in 30-45 cups of decaffeinated green tea. B-8. Tumor Specificity In addition to the overall approach outlined a bove, various tumor types, such as hormone sensitive breast and prostate cancer, are approach ed through substances that address these hormone sensitivities. The relative proliferative stimul ation of estrogens can be effected through the use of Page 12 February 2006 indoles, such as diindole methane (84). Various brain tumors have s hown sensitivity to boswellic acid, derived from frankincense (85). Different cancers, su ch as colon and prostate , have demonstrated an enhanced sensitivity to inflammatory factors, and th erefore the anti-inflammatory aspect of the general protocol would be emphasized in these tumors. Other tumors, such as indolent lymphomas, have a significant upregulation of BCl-2 prot eins and resistance to apoptosis. Therefore proapoptotic agents are emphasized in the overall treatment program. As more is learned about the specific biochemical, signal transduction and molecular aspects of tumor types, a nd how different natural subs tances can affect these processes, the treatments can potentially be tailored in a more exact way. In a similar way, as gene profiling of individual tumors progre sses, this will allow tumor tailored to the individual patient. B-9. Summary The integrative approach to the treatment of ma lignancies usually involves a multiagent protocol, attempting to address known factors that promote the growth, spread and metastasis of tumors. Numerous agents are typically employed to addr ess inflammation, angiogen esis, and apoptosis. Inflammation, as an example, is often addressed th rough diet, high doses of omega-3 fatty acids, and herbs such as curcumin and boswellia, which are known to affect COX-1, COX-2 and leukotriene pathways. As in all illnesses, different phases of th e illness are treated differently. The treatment of a patient undergoing surgery can be si gnificantly different from one in a watch and wait mode. The level of evidence supporting these treatment s is relatively low compared to that available for conventional treatments, although a great deal more literature exists than is gene rally recognized or acknowledged. The toxicity of these integrative agents is relatively low. Various controversies exist regarding the use of these incompletely studied agents. One very important consideration is whethe r antioxidants should be used conc urrently with chemotherapy or radiation therapy. In addition to th e use of natural substances, other modalities, such as acupuncture and therapeutic massage, are often suggested, and can be of significant benefit in many clinical situations. The basic science literature concerning these substan ces is substantial, and the presence and experience of clinicians is sufficient, to al low fruitful clinical inquiry and a ppropriate application as to their potential role in the treatment of patients with malignancies. B-10. Generic integrative protocol for biological agents in malignancy Anti-Inflammation 1) Anti-inflammatory diet. 2) Fish Oils containing omega-3 fatty acids - dosag e ranges typically from 4-20 grams of a typical fish oil supplement, one capsule of which typi cally contains about 4- 500 mg of EPA and DHA. Some fish oil supplements contain twice the amount of EPA and DHA and dosage should be adjusted accordingly. 3) Curcumin - 1500-3000 mg daily. 4) Boswellia - 900-1800 mg daily 5) COX 2 inhibitors - due to the recent concer n of an increase incidence of cardiovascular incidents, especially with high doses, these ag ents should only be used judiciously and in combination with other agents that block the ot her inflammatory pathways, such as COX 1 and leukotrienes. It should be noted that recommended herbs above also have inhibiting effects on these other pathways. 6) Leukotriene inhibitors - consider montelukast 10mg/d in more a dvanced situations, again with the considerations noted about COX 2 inhibition. 7) Consider monitoring of inflammatory mark ers: high sensitivity CRP, fibrinogen, IL6. Page 13 Anti-Angiogenesis 1) Antiinflammatory and antioxidative programs decrease angiogenesis. 2) Experimental agents such as ammonium tetrathiomolybdate ma y prove beneficial. Immune Modulation 1) European mistletoe. 2) Mushroom preparations - Coriolus preparations (PSK and PSP) are the most widely studied. Dosages are 1500-3000 mg daily. Other preparations , such as Maitake, Shitake and mixtures are also commonly used. Genistein Complex Po lysaccharide, a fermented combination of genistein and ganoderma, combines in a synerg istic manner the benefits of isoflavones and mushrooms Anti-Oxidant and Detoxification. 1) Assess risk/benefit in conjunction with chemotherapy and radiation. 2) High potency multivitamin/mineral supplements - numerous good formulations exist. Use formulations which are iron and copper free. Assure daily intake of selenium 200-400 mcg. 3) Pycnogenol - grape leaf and pine needle preparations contain pycnogenol. (400 mg of pycnogenol/day) 4) Green tea concentrates, decaffeinated - equivalent of 15-45 cups daily, or red tea concentrates (naturally free in caffeine and oxalic acid and low in tannins. 5) N-acetyl cysteine - 1500 mg daily (see also under detoxification) Promote Apoptosis: effected by all of the above Re-Differentiation. 1) Vitamin A - blood levels need to be check ed at baseline and with extended use. Short term use - 100,000-300,000 iu/day, not to exceed 1-2 months Medium term use - 40,000-50,000 iu/day, for up to 1 year Long term use - 20,000 iu/d, for up to 5 years there is a concern re: osteoporosis 2) Vitamin D. Correct to serum level 25-OH-D of 75 ng/ml. Vit D2 or Vit D3 - 1,000 - 6,000 iu/day Calcitriol (1-25-OH vit D) - .5mcg/kg weekly 3) Consider the use of insulin sensitizing agents, su ch as glitazones (Actos or Avandia), especially in overweight patients.
