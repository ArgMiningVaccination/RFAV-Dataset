It is a Natural and Holistic Medicine practice that focuses primarily on treatments in Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine. Our focus is wellness and life quality for each person individually. Our theory is~ to have optimum health and wellness the body needs to be balanced. At Balanced Integrative Health in Pine City, there are no preset protocols to treating certain problems or illnesses. After all, every body is different, and a treatment that might work well for one person, may not work at all for another person with the same symptoms. All treatments are unique to each individual and their own body. We do not just focus on treating symptoms, but look at the body as a whole to find the root cause of the problems or symptoms. Treating the root cause helps the body re-balance and when that happens the symptoms reduce, or are even eliminated completely. We do not accept medical insurance, but we accept HSA cards and upon request we will print you a super bill receipt that you can submit to your insurance company to attempt reimbursement if your plan does cover acupuncture.
