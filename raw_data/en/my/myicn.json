For sev-eral CAM therapies, there is a lack of evidence supporting efficacy and safety\u2014particularly regarding their use for specific medical indications. 7,8 Some therapies may have serious adverse effects, such as interac-tions between herbal products and prescription medications. 9-11 Oth- ers appear to operate by biological mechanisms not yet understood or not accepted by Western medical sci- ence. 7,8 Physicians also have voiced concern that a primary reliance on CAM therapies could mask serious illness, contributing to delays in ac-curate diagnosis and optimal treat-ment. 7,8 These concerns can act as a barrier to providers' enhancing their understanding of CAM and making appropriate, well grounded recom-mendations. In initiating any CAM-oriented program at a conventional medical facility , therefore, it is important to address these scientific and medical concerns. Mindful of this, we devel-oped the Integrative Health Care Pro-gram (IHCP) at the VA Salt Lake City Health Care System (VA SLCHCS) with a view toward: (1) integration of scientifically supported CAM therapies into conventional medical care in an outpatient setting, target-ing those medical conditions likely to respond to such therapies; (2) education of providers and patients regarding which CAM therapies are beneficial and which are not; (3) de-velopment of clinical research proto-cols to assess the safety and efficacy of selected CAM therapies; (4) explo-ration, development, and evaluation of new models of integrative health care; and (5) reintegration of physi-cal, emotional, mental, and spiritual life values into health care and health education. The intent was to begin with a few modalities and build on program acceptance and success. In this article, we describe the is- sues we considered in planning the program, the steps we took to bring our ideas to fruition, and the admin-istrative processes that facilitated implementation. We also describe the current operation of the IHCP clinic\u2014which, along with staff and patient educational programs and clinical research activities, comprises the IHCP . Formal assessment of pa-tient outcomes associated with the IHCP is beyond the scope of this ar-ticle. Research activities in this area are in progress. CAM IN THE VHA Studies of CAM use and availability conducted within the VHA reveal trends similar to those noted in the United States in general. A 2000 sur-vey conducted in a random sample of 508 primary care patients at the Southern Arizona VA Health Care System in T ucson indicated that ap-proximately 50% used one or more CAM therapies. 12 In this study , CAM use was significantly associated with veterans' reports of current high lev-Dr. Overall and Ms. Smeeding are codirectors of the Integrative Health Care Program (IHCP) at the VA Salt Lake City Health Care System (VA SLCHCS) in Salt Lake City, UT.

Complementary and Alternative Medicine Developing an Integrative Health Care Program James C. Overall, Jr., MD, Sandra Smeeding, APRN, MS, CNS, FNP-C, and Susan G. Osguthorpe, RN, MS, CNA Recognizing the growing role of complementary and alternative medicine in their patients' lives, these VA providers found a way to incorporate some of these \"uncon- ventional\" therapies into the scope of services provided by their facility .JANUARY 2006 \u007f FEDERAL PRACTITIONER \u007f 17els of daily stress; a perceived negative impact of military life on physical or mental health; overseas military ser-vice; and such physician-diagnosed conditions as back pain, depression, gastrointestinal disorders, generalized pain, anxiety , sleep problems, asthma, posttraumatic stress disorder, liver problems, and chronic fatigue. 12 The sources veterans used for guidance in their choice of CAM therapy , in order of frequency of use, were: friends, family , news and magazine articles, medical references, food store clerks, and their primary care provider. 13 Re- liance largely on nonmedical sources of information raises the concern that CAM therapies might supersede or adversely interact with optimal con-ventional medicine care. 7,8 In 2002, a nationwide survey of CAM practices was performed at the VA 's 149 health care facilities. 14 Among the 146 responding facili-ties, 84% indicated that they pro-vide or refer patients for one or more CAM therapies. The most common therapies offered at these facilities included stress management or re-laxation methods (59%), progressive relaxation (47%), biofeedback medita-tion (25%), and acupuncture (22%). The findings of this survey also indicated a need for: (1) adequate documentation of both evidence-based support for the CAM therapies chosen and the specific medical in-dications for the therapies, and (2) standardized criteria for credentialing CAM providers within the VA. 14 PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT A number of factors support the development of an IHCP at a VA medical center. First, several CAM therapies have demonstrated efficacy and safety against conditions com-mon in the VA patient population (such as chronic pain 15) and, there- fore, could enhance quality of life for veterans. 4,5 Second, since veter- ans and VA facilities are already using CAM, perhaps with less than optimal guidance or approval, it is important to establish a framework for evalu-ating these therapies. 12,13 Third, we believe that the proper way to address issues of CAM use by veterans is to do it within the VA system, using an approach that includes education, guidance, and outcomes assessment, followed by integration of those CAM therapies and integrative health con-cepts that demonstrate benefit. Issues addressed at the outset Recognizing that CAM therapies might be controversial among some administrative and professional staff members, we met with our facility's organizational leadership to estab-lish common ground and overcome barriers. To determine whether there was fertile ground for this program, we performed institutional assessments through in-service and workshop presentations and by maintaining a dialogue with key leaders to elicit and respond to questions and concerns. Most of the concerns raised related to evidence-based support for the use of particular CAM therapies for specific medical indications; general safety and efficacy of the therapies; and quality , certification, and licensure of prospective CAM providers. Overall, however, we found open- ness at the VA SLCHCS to the inte-grative health approach\u2014as long as the program adhered to institutional and professional guidelines and regu-lations. We came up with a business plan and budget for the IHCP , which were approved by the facility's Clini-cal Executive Board (CEB), a panel of the chiefs of the clinical services. With guidance from the chief of staff, the associate chief of staff for patient services, and the executive as-sistant for clinical affairs, we devel-oped guidelines for applying for CEB approval of CAM therapies (Table 1). These included referenced discus-sions of medical indications, safety , and efficacy of each CAM modality . We also developed a template to ad-dress quality , certification, and licen-sure issues when applying to the facility's Professional Standards Board for credentialing CAM providers (Table 2). In this way , CAM modal-ities and providers were subjected to Table 1.

Selecting CAM therapies and providers Specific CAM therapies were chosen for inclusion in the IHCP using sev-eral parameters. First, a given therapy needed data from peer-reviewed, scientific publications (such as ran-domized, controlled trials and tech-nology assessments) that supported safety and efficacy for specific indi-cations relevant to veterans. Second, the therapy should not be overly con-troversial and should be generally accepted by the conventional med-ical community . Third, the therapy was already being used or had been requested by VA providers and patients. Fourth, in most cases, there were existing VA staff members trained and certified to provide the therapy . All CAM therapies provided by VA staff are included in their scope of practice as outlined by the institu-tion and by their state license. To reduce initial costs (such as those associated with hiring new staff or contracting with outside provid-ers), existing VA personnel were di-rected to provide CAM therapies a few hours each week as part of their regular professional duties. As a re-sult, less than one additional full-time equivalent position was required to start the program. Getting other departments on board At the start of the program, we rec- ognized that CAM modalities would involve or affect several services and programs in the medical cen-ter. Therefore, we developed a mul-tidisciplinary steering committee to provide guidance in establishing the IHCP . On this committee are repre-sentatives from facility administra-tion; the departments of anesthesia, patient education, physical therapy , information management, pharmacy , physical medicine and rehabilita-tion, pain management, primary care, mental health, and social work; nu-trition services; the learning center; and the chaplain's office. Initially , the steering committee met on a monthly basis, but now it meets quarterly . The IHCP codirectors and clinical support manager continue to meet regularly to address organizational issues and to track progress of the program. Program literature In order to educate patients about the therapies offered through the IHCP , we developed a program bro-chure that contains a short explana-tion of the purpose of the clinic as well as brief descriptions of the CAM therapies and classes offered. We also created more detailed brochures or flyers for specific CAM therapies and classes. THE IHCP CLINIC The IHCP clinic reports to the chief of staff. At present, patient evaluation and treatment occur only in the out-patient setting. The initial target populations for the IHCP clinic were patients with chronic pain, patients with a strong desire for smoking cessation or weight management, and patients who could benefit from strategies for managing stress arising from a chronic disease (such as anxiety or depression). For these populations, there was evidence in the scientific literature of benefit from the CAM modalities initially chosen. Treatment of such patients through the IHCP clinic was integrated in an interdisci-plinary fashion with services already offered at the VA SLCHCS, such as pain medicine, smoking cessation, and weight management. Although most patients are re- ferred to the clinic by their primary care providers, some referrals have come from specialty care, mental health, and pain medicine profes-sionals. To date, over 90% of referrals have been for the adjunctive manage-ment of chronic pain. Most of these patients also have other associated diseases, such as diabetes, mental health disorders, chronic musculo-skeletal conditions, and cardiovascu-lar disease. After referral, patients undergo an intake assessment by one of the IHCP clinic codirectors (Table 3). During this visit, the CAM therapies and classes offered through the IHCP clinic are reviewed with the patient Table 2.

Examples of completed applications are available electronically from the authors (see Table 1 footnote).JANUARY 2006 \u007f FEDERAL PRACTITIONER \u007f 19COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE (Table 4). Following this assessment, patients may be referred for particular CAM therapies, based on their prefer-ences and the clinical decision of the IHCP clinic codirectors. Many pa-tients with chronic pain, for instance, request and are referred for both acu-puncture and hypnotherapy clinic appointments. Recommendations to attend the weekly drop-in meditation or Qigong classes or to register for the more in-depth courses or thera-pies (\"Choosing to Heal,\" \"Fit and Trim for Life\" weight management, the smoking cessation program, aquatic bodywork, or yoga) generally depend on the patient's needs and in-terests. Patients referred for aquatic bodywork or yoga receive a muscu-loskeletal screening by the physical therapy department to determine any restrictions for participants. All CAM therapies and classes are provided on the VA SLCHCS campus in existing clinic or classroom space. Patient follow-up includes a routine IHCP clinic visit every six months to monitor outcome and to assess the need for additional management. REFLECTIONS ON THE PROCESS We found several factors to be valu-able in implementing the program. The experience and credibility of the IHCP codirectors and clinical support manager made a difference. These staff members were known to indi-viduals in the VA SLCHCS leadership through previous experience. In addi-tion, meeting with key decision mak-ers at the beginning of the process to hear and respond to questions and concerns was important. Other key ingredients were: \u007f evidence-based and strategic se- lection of the CAM therapies and classes to be implemented; \u007f a formal process for CEB ap- proval of IHCP and each CAM modality; \u007f credentialing and privileging of each CAM provider by the Pro-fessional Standards Board; and \u007f use of the CAM modalities as adjuncts to, rather than replace-ments for, the optimal conven-tional medical therapy provided at the VA SLCHCS. We did encounter some barriers. First, because of a shortage of clinic space and growth of the program, it was necessary to negotiate for addi-tional rooms and days of use. These were made available based on dem-onstrated need. Second, though we attempted to implement a massage therapy program, we could not over-come the economic obstacles. Spe-cifically , it was too costly to utilize an existing VA staff member (such as a nurse who was also a licensed mas-sage therapist) for one-on-one mas-sage sessions. We investigated using massage therapy school students, but issues\u2014such as proper supervision by faculty who had sufficient experi-ence with elderly patients with mul-tiple medical illnesses\u2014could not be solved to the satisfaction of both the VA and the schools. How have patients responded to the IHCP? We have received a great deal of positive feedback, includ-ing such statements as: \"I was at the end of my rope; I feel like I have my life back,\" and \"After going through the IHCP clinic and the 'Choosing to Heal' class, I am now able to ad-dress issues in my life that I did not have the courage to face before.\" The patients have expressed particular ap-preciation of: the quality time spent with the CAM providers; the encour-agement these providers give them to strive for a better life; the sense of self-empowerment that comes from participating in their own healing pro-cess and experiencing meaningful improvement; and the consideration the IHCP staff and CAM providers give to physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual aspects of their lives. Some patients did not respond to IHCP management. The major rea-sons for this appear to be: lack of resonance with the CAM therapies and classes, medical or social issues that interfere with full participation, and residence too far from the VA facility to return for weekly visits. In the initial stages of the pro- gram, many conventional providers were skeptical, and referrals were slow. Now that providers have seen improvement among many of the pa-tients with particularly challenging Table 3.

Referrals have in-creased to the point that we now have a waiting list for the IHCP clinic. IMPLICATIONS FOR THE FUTURE Over time, there has been increasing openness, acceptance, and support for CAM at the VA 's national level, as well as the local level. In early 2004, the VA National Leadership Board ap-proved establishment of a National CAM Advisory Group to evaluate the efficacy , safety , and potential long- term benefits of CAM therapies using clinical, educational, and research approaches. The first meeting of this committee was held in Washington, DC in September 2004. Our working hypothesis is that the IHCP at the VA SLCHCS will improve patients' medical outcomes, enhance their quality of life, and increase their satisfaction. It also may prove to be cost-effective over the long term, as patients assume more responsibility for their own care and healing. Proof of these benefits will require carefully designed clinical trials and assess-ment of outcomes. Currently , a retro-spective, quantitative and qualitative assessment of patients' responses to this pilot program is underway .

DoD Updates Uniform Formulary William Winkenwerder, MD, assis- tant secretary of defense for health affairs and director of the TRICARE Management Activity , has approved changes to the TRICARE Uniform Formulary (UF) recommended by the DoD's Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P&T) Committee. These changes include the addition of medications in three therapeutic classes (alpha-block-ers for benign prostatic hypertrophy and angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors and calcium channel blockers for cardiovascular disease) and the transfer of 16 medications to nonformulary status over the next few months. In accordance with UF procedures, the P&T Committee's recommenda-tions, made in August 2005, were subjected to review and comment by the DoD's Beneficiary Advisory Panel, which is comprised of representatives of active duty families and retirees, civilian health care professionals, and TRICARE contractors. This panel expressed concern about the designa-tion of the ACE inhibitor ramipril as a nonformulary agent. But though the P&T Committee agreed that this drug plays an important role in treating some high risk patients with a history of cardiovascular disease, it ultimately determined that the ACE inhibitors available on the formulary are equally effective in most cases. TRICARE beneficiaries currently taking ramipril\u2014or other drugs that will become nonformulary agents this year\u2014should consult with their pro-viders to determine whether switch-ing to a formulary alternative would be appropriate or whether there is a medical necessity to continue using the nonformulary drug. When a health care provider demonstrates medical necessity for a nonformulary agent, beneficiaries may qualify to obtain the drug at the copayment used for formu-lary brand name medications ($9 from a TRICARE Retail Network Pharmacy or from the TRICARE Mail Order Pharmacy), rather than that usually required for nonformulary drugs ($22). Active duty beneficiaries who fill their prescriptions at a military medical treat-ment facility pay no copayment, but they cannot receive nonformulary medications unless their provider demonstrates medical necessity . More information about the for- mulary changes, a formulary search tool, and a chart displaying formulary alternatives for certain nonformulary medications along with links to medi-cal necessity forms are all available at the pharmacy portion of the TRI-CARE web site (www.tricare.osd.mil/pharmacy).
