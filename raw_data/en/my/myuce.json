Although some MRAP2 mutations have been described in people with obesity1-3, their functional consequences on adiposity remain elusive . Using large -scale sequencing of MRAP2 in 9,418 people, we identified 23 rare heterozygous variants associated with increased obesity risk in both adults and children. Functional assessment of each variant show s that loss -of- function MRAP2 variants are pathogenic for monogenic hyperphagic obesity , with hyperglycemia and hypertension . This contrasts with other monogenic forms of obesity characterized by excessive hunger , including MC4R deficiency , that present with low blood pressure and normal glucose tolerance4. The pleiotropic metabolic effect of loss-of- function mutations in MRAP2 might be due to the failure of different MRAP2 -regulated GPCRs in various tissues including pancreatic islets . According to the World Health Organization, t he worldwide prevalence of obesity nearly tripled between 1975 and 2016 . About 2 billion people are currently overweight , and their co- morbidities represent a major medical burden . The biological link between obesity and type 2 diabetes is still debated as most individuals with obesity never develop diabetes. If classic views postulate that insulin resistance eventually exhaust insulin -producing cells, alternatively genetically -driven abnormal pathways may lead to both appetite dysregulation and insulin secretion defects, and also to other abnormalities such as hypertension. While common o besity is seen as a multifactorial di sorder, w e and others have found that rare mutations in more than 15 genes cause monogenic obesity , including MC4R (encoding the melanocortin -4 receptor) that is the most frequently mutated gene in monogenic obesity5. Importantly, the characterization of these mutations has enabled the development of new drugs (e.g. the MC4R agonist setmelanotide in patients deficient for POMC or LEPR )6,7. Recently, a study has shown that the loss of function of Mrap2 (encoding melanocortin -2 receptor accessory protein 2 ) is 3 associated with rodent obesity1. The authors demonstrated MRAP2 interacted directly with MC4R, and enha nced MC4R downstream in response to a MC4R agonist, suggesting that MC4R signaling was a mechanism linking Mrap2 loss of function and obesity1. When sequencing MRAP2 in 976 people with obesity and controls, the authors identified four rare variants in four participants with severe obesity, that were not present in the controls , and suggested MRAP2 as a new gene causing monogenic obesity1. The authors did not perform statistical or functional analyses of these variants. Another rare non -synonymous variant was described in a patient with obesity associated with the Prader -Willi -like syndrome , but still without functional assays2. Furthermore, Schonnop et al. described a rare MRAP2 mutation (p.Q174R) decreasing MC4R activity in vitro , in a girl with severe obesity3. Here , we perform ed a large -scale resequencing study of MRAP2 , in combination with functional assays of detected variant s, to accurately decipher the functional link between MRAP2 signa ling and obesity (and possibly other phenotypes) in humans. The coding exons of MRAP2 were sequenced in 9,418 participants including 7,239 adults, and 2,179 children or adolescents (Supplementary Table 1 ). We detected 23 rare heterozygous variants (with a minor allele frequency [MAF] between 0.053 and 1.65 ), 14 of which were novel (Table 1 , Fig. 1). The cluster of rare MRAP2 variants was significantly associated with an increased risk of obesity in adults ( nvariant = 14; P = 8.04\u00d710-4 with an odds ratio [OR] of 3. 80, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1. 71-9.26) and in children or adolescents ( nvariant = 13; P = 0.0148 with an OR of 2.91, 95% CI: 1.23 -7.32). When we added the participants with overweight in the adult case -control study , the cluster of rare MRAP2 variants was still significantly associated with an increased risk of adiposity (nvariant = 17; P = 2.25\u00d710-3 with an OR of 3.13, 95% CI: 1.53-7.27). These data are in line with exome sequencing data from 42,992 participants included in the Accelerating Medicine Partnership (AMP) Type 2 Diabetes knowledge portal , where protein -truncating or missense MRAP2 variants (with a MAF < 1% in each ancestry) 4 were significantly associated with increased body mass index (BMI; nvariant = 46; P 95% CI: 0.0165 -0.0564). This association was even stronger when focusing on protein -truncating or probably deleterious missense MRAP2 variants -0.226). Here , we used the standards and guidelines of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) to assess the pathogenicity of each detected variant. To address the strong pathogenic ACMG criterion PS3, we analyzed the functional effect of each MRAP2 variant on MC4R activity . MC4R and mutant (PKA) signaling through luciferase reporter assays in response to -melanocyte - stimulating in the presence of MRAP2 ) (Extended data Fig. 1 )8- 10. When compared with wild-type MRAP2 , we downstream of MC4R in response to MSH and ACTH (Extended data Fig. 2). These loss-of-function variants were mostly located in highly conserved loci (Fig. 1). According to ACMG criteria ( now including the functional -based criterion PS3), we identified seven pathogenic or likely pathogenic, loss -of-function 1 . These variants were identified in seven adults of European origin with obesity or overweight , and in three European adolescents with obesity (Table 2 ). Therefore , they were completely penetrant for obesity or overweight. Two mutations (p.N77S and p.P195L) cosegregated with obesity in two families that were available for segregation analysis (Extended data Fig. 3). The majority (75%) of the carriers reported abnormal eating behavior, i.e. overeating, sna cking and/or bulimia (Table 2 ). According to the serum levels of 15 steroid hormones (including cortisol, cortisone, 5 testosterone, aldosterone), none of the carriers had dysfunction of the hypothalamic -pituitary - adrenal axis ( Supplementary Table 2 ). We found that all carriers except one adolescent (participant #10) presented with the phenotypes of metabolic syndrome ( Table 2 ). Apart from high adiposity, the two mo st frequent metabolic features were hyperglycemia and hypertension (Table 2 , Fig. 2). This is noteable as the prevalence of the aggregation of these phenotypes that constitute the so -called metabolic syndrome among people with (polygenic) overweight or obesity usually ranges from 20 to 60% according to our present cohort analys is (Supplementary Table 3) and the literature11. Importantly , when compared to other monogenic forms of obesity including those due to the deficiency of LEP, is singular as it leads to a markedly higher rate of hyperglycemia and hypertension ( Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 4). Among MRAP2 -deficient participants, we did not find any other (likely) pathogenic variant in 48 genes known to be involved in monogenic obesity or in monogenic diabetes , except for the 17-year old participant #10 . In this subject , we indeed also found a likely pathogenic mutation in ABCC8 (NM_000352.4: c.647G>A, p.R216H) . Pathogenic gain-of-function mutations monogenic diabetes in infancy, while loss -of-function mutations cause hypoglycemic episodes due to inappropriate hyperinsulinism12,13. In view of her low f asting glucose levels (4.33 mmol/l) with surprisingly elevated fasting insulin levels (88.9 pmol/l), it is poss ible that this presumably increases insulin secretion, thus normaliz ing glyca emia and mask ing the metabolic abnormalities caused by the pathogenic MRAP2 mutation. As the MRAP2 -deficient participants mostly presented with hyperglycemia in addition to high adiposity , we assessed MRAP2 expression in a panel of human tissues using a PCR -free technology that we previously described and validated14. We found that MRAP2 expression level was similar ly high in human pancreatic islets and beta cells, the human beta -cell line EndoC -H1, and brain regions (Extended data Fig. 4.a). We confirmed MRAP2 protein 6 expression in human islets and EndoC -H1 by Western blot ( Extended data Fig. 4.b). Based on these data, we assessed the involvement of MRAP2 in beta-cell function by perform ing glucose -stimulated assay in EndoC -H1 cells15, in expression was decreased with a specific siRNA . We found that the fold change of insulin concentration was significantly decreased in EndoC -H1 cells treated with the siRNA targeting MRAP2 compared to the control cells (Extended data Fig. 5). These results were in line with previous data obtained from mouse models. Indeed, although Asai et al. showed that Mrap2 -null mice had normal fasting insulin and normal tolerance to intraperitoneal glucose injection1, two subsequent studies reported that Mrap2 -null mice (with different genetic backgrounds from the previous Mrap2 -null mice ) had impaired glucose homeostasis under fasting or after a glucose or insulin tolerance test16,17. Rouault et al. also demonstrated that impaired glucose tolerance of Mrap2 KO mice occurred before they developed obesity16. These results suggest that MRAP2 mutations could have a direct functional deleterious effect on beta cells. In conclusion, w e describe a new monogenic form of hyperphagic obesity due to pathogenic, loss-of-function mutations in MRAP2 , which is also associated with hyperglycemia and hypertension. This is phenotypically very different from other forms of monogenic obesity with appetite dysfunction described so far , including MC4R deficiency , where patients with obesity along with high plasma glucose and high blood pressure have been scarcely reported (Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 4 and ref.4). In addition to brain and pancreatic islets, MRAP2 is expressed in several human metabolic tissues including the gut, kidney, adipose tissue and skeletal muscle ( Extended data Fig. 4.a). MRAP2 not only regulates the activity of melanocortin receptors but is also involved in the regulation of other GPCRs including prokineticin receptors and the growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a (GHSR1a) , namely the ghrelin receptor18,19. Therefore, we suggest that the spectrum of metabolic phenotypes observed in people carrying a pathogenic, loss -of-function MRAP2 mutation is due to the 7 impaired regulatory effect of MRAP2 on metabolically active GPCRs across various key tissues , explaining the pleiotropic effect of this protein . In this regard , ghrelin and its receptor have been involved in blood pressure regulation20, which could explain the high blood pressure observed in the people deficient for MRAP2 . As MRAP2 deficiency partly impacts the MC4R pathway, the eating behavior problems in MRAP2 -deficient subjects might be treated by the MC4R agonist setmelanotide7. References 1. Asai, M. et al.

Oral assent from children or adolescents was obtained and parents (or legal guardian) signed an informed consent form . In participants older than 18 years, class I obesity was defined as 30 BMI < 35 kg/m\u00b2, class II as 35 BMI < 40 kg/m\u00b2, class III as BMI 40 kg/m\u00b2, overweight as 25 BMI < 30 kg/m\u00b2 and normal weight as BMI < 25 kg/m\u00b2. In children and adolescents younger t han 18 years, obesity was defined as 95th BMI-for-age < 99th percentile, severe obesity was defined as BMI -for-age 99th percentile, while normal weight was defined as BMI -for-age < 85th percentile according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth charts. Type 2 diabetes was defined as fasting plasma glucose 7.0 mmol/L, plasma glucose measured 2 hours during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) 11.1 mmol/L, an d/or use of hyperglycemia treatment; hyperglycemia or pre -diabetes was defined as 5.6 fasting plasma glucose < 7.0 mmol/l without hyperglycemia treatment, and normal glucose was defined as fasting plasma glucose < 5.6 mmol/l without hyperglycemia treatme nt27. 18 Metabolic syndrome was defined following the criteria of the third report of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) expert panel on detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood cholesterol in adults (ATP III)28: a waistline that measured at least 88 cm for women and 102 cm for men or a waist -hip ratio 0.9 for men and 0.8 for women, triglyceride levels 1.70 mmol/l, high -density lipoprotein (HDL) levels 1.04 mmol/l in men and HDL levels 1.30 mmol/l in women, systolic blood pressure (SBP) 130 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 85 mmHg, and hyperglycemia. A patient with metabolic syndrome had at least three criteria28. In the carriers of a pathogenic, loss -of-function MRAP2 mutation, steroid hormones were measured in serum samples through liquid chromatography -tandem mass spectrometry performed either by Sanger sequencing ( n = 809) or by next -generation sequencing (NGS; n = 8,609). Regarding Sanger sequencing, the three coding exons of MRAP2 were analyzed in three fragments. Primer sequences and PCR conditions are available upon request. Fragments were sequenced in both directions, and subsequently analyzed using the 3730x l DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Electrophoregram reads were assembled and examined using the Variant Reporter software (Applied Biosystems). Regarding NGS, target enrichment was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (NimbleGen SeqCap EZ) for Illumina sequencing. fragmented through sonication (Covaris E220 Focused -ultrasonicator). The fragmented DNA samples were end -repaired and ligated to the adapters using the KAPA HTP Library Preparation Kits, on the Hamilton Microl ab STARlet automate. These samples were subsequently amplified by PCR . After size selection and sample quantification (Perkin Elmer LabChip GX), 24 samples were combined in a single pool of at least 1 \u00b5g, and hybridized to 19 the biotin -labeled SeqCap EZ prob e pool. After 72 hours at 47 \u00b0C, the captures were purified using the SeqCap Hybridization and Wash Kit on the Agilent Bravo Automated Liquid Handling Platform. Captures were subsequently amplified using the KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix and quantified by bo th Perkin GX and Thermo Fisher Scientific Qubit fluorometric quantitation the samples were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 system (with a throughput of one pool per lane), using a paired -end 2\u00d7150 bp protocol. The demultipl exing of sequence data was performed using bcl2fastq Conversion Software (Illumina; version 2.17). Subsequently, sequence reads were mapped to the human genome (hg19/GRCh37) using Burrows -Wheeler Aligner (version 0.7.13)29. Genome Analysis ToolKit (GATK; version 3.3)30. Only variants with a coverage higher than 8 reads were kept for further analyses. The annotation of variants was performed using the Ensembl Perl Application Program Interfaces (version 75) and custom Perl scripts to include data from both dbSNP (version 135) and dbNSFP (version 3.0) databases31,32. All detecte d variants in MRAP2 had a QUAL score higher than 50. Furthermore, no variant had more than 5% of missing genotype (with a coverage below 8 reads or a QUAL score below 50) across the participants, and no participant had more than 5% of missing genotypes (wi th a coverage below 8 reads or a QUAL score below 50) across MRAP2 . The location of each variant (either detected by Sanger sequencing or NGS) was determined relative to the translation initiation codon using Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) nomencla ture for the description of sequence variations. The positions of mutations were indicated according to the human genome build hg19/GRCh37. Sequencing of genes involved in monogenic obesity or monogenic diabetes: In the 10 carriers of a pathogenic, loss -of-function MRAP2 mutation, we analyzed the putative presence of a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in 48 genes known to be involved in monogenic obesity or assessment: Ancestry of mutated individuals was assessed using the first two genotypic principal components (PC1 and PC2) calculated from at least 10,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; w ith a MAF >5%) present in each mutated individual (where genotypes were obtained from DNA arrays or NGS data) and in the 1,000 Genomes project. Design of variant analysis: We only analyzed rare variants of potential interest 1%. We assessed the pathogenicity o f the variants using the ACMG criteria for the interpretation of rare variants ( Supplementary Tables 5 & 6)33. To address the strong pathogenic criterion PS3, we used our in -house in vitro functional analyses (see below). In vitro functional analyses: Twenty -two variants (including one frameshift variant and 21 missense variants) detected in the participants and one negative control variant (c.10C>T, p.Q4*) were generated in 23 novel plasmid was checked by Sanger sequencing. The effect of each MRAP2 variant on MC4R activity was assessed in CHO cells in response to different concentrations (0 - 30 nM) of MSH and of ACTH. For this purpose, CHO cells w ere cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) F12 5% 2. Cells were transfected in suspension with 225 ng/ml of plasmid including the firefly luciferase gene under the control of cAMP response element (CRE), 150 ng/ml of plasmid including the -galactosidase 6 (Promega), and they were seeded in 48 -well plates at a concentration of 600,000 cells/ml in a volume of 200 \u00b5l. The day after, the medium was replaced by medium with 0.1% FBS for overnight serum starvation; 48 hours after the transfection, the cells were treated with increas ing doses of MSH (Abcam) or ACTH (Sigma) from 0 to 30,000 pM. Five hours after the treatment, the cells were lysed with 100 \u00b5l of Luciferase Cell Culture Lysis buffer (Promega) . The luminescence was assessed by \u00b5l the Luciferase Assay System reagent (Promega) in 40 \u00b5l of was read under a Glomax luminometer (Promega). The -galactosidase activity was measured after incubation of 40 \u00b5l of the lysate for 5 minutes with 100 \u00b5l of home -made buffer (NaHPO4 0.479 g, NAH2PO4 - 2M 0.5 ml, MgCl2 1M 0.1 ml, \u00b5l/ml]) and was read at 450 nm. Of note, we primarily found that the best profile of MC4R activation in response to MSH was obtained using one volume of MC4R plasmid in addition to eight volumes of MRAP2 plasmid, when compared to 1:2, 1:3 and 1:6 MC4R:MRAP2 ratios (data not shown). The experiments were done in technical triplicates, and each experiment was repeated three times. Luciferase measurements in relative luminescence unit (RLU) were normalized using -galactosidase measures. Fold change was computed by dividing normalized luciferase ( L*) by the mean of the baseline sures. This normalized luciferase fold -change ( ) was analyzed using a linear regression model. The mutation ( ), the agonist concentration ( ), as an orthogonal polynomial function of degree 3 ( ) to enable possible non -linear relations between and , and the interaction term ( ) between and was included in the model as a covariate. The model was defined as follows: =0+1+++ 22 with, =11+22+33 =11+22+33 Our functional assay was validated using a negative control (p.Q4*; Supplementary Figure 2). MRAP2 Expression analyses: The expression analysis of MRAP2 was performed using the NanoString technology, that is a multiplex digital quantification of nucleic acids (without PCR - based amplification), in a large panel of human tissues, as previously described34. The panel included human RNA from the colon, small intestine, liver, kidney, adipose tissue, placenta, lung, skeletal muscle, by laser [LCM beta cells] or by flow cytometry beta cells] ), exocrine pancreas and the beta cell line EndoC -H135. Western Blot a nalyses: Proteins were extracted from CHO cells transfected or not with 450 ng of MRAP2 plasmid, human pancreatic islets (pool of 2 donors) and EndoC -H1 cells, using Pierce RIPA Buffer (Thermo Scientific) according to manufacturer's instructions. Proteins were quantified by Bradford technique using BioRad Protein Assay (BioRad). 50 \u00b5g (for islets and EndoC -H1) or 10 \u00b5g (for CHO cells) of proteins with Laemmli buffer 4X (Alfa Aesar) were denatu rated at 95 \u00b0C for 5 minutes and loaded for migration on a concentration gel (Acrylamide 4% [Dutscher], SDS 0.2%, Ammonium -SDS Buffer (Eurobio -Ingen). After migration, the proteins transferred on a nitrocellulose membrane (BioRad) in Tris -Glycin e Buffer (Eurobio -Ingen). The non -specific sites were blocked with a 1 hour -incubation in TBS Buffer 23 (Euromedex) + 0.1% Tween 20 (Biosolve) + 5% skimmed milk (Dutscher) under agitation. Then, the membrane was incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C under agitation wit h the MRAP2 antibody (Bioss; 1/300 in TBS Buffer + Bovine Serum Albumin [Sigma Aldrich]). After the incubation, the membrane was washed 3 times in TBS Buffer + 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated for 1 hour at room temperature under agitati on with anti -rabbit HRP antibody (Cell signaling; 1/2500 in TBS Buffer + 0.1% Tween 20 + 5% skimmed milk). After the incubation, the membrane was washed 3 times in TBS Buffer + 0.1% Tween 20. ECL Prime (Amersham) was used to reveal the protein of interest and the reading was performed using a Chemidoc (BioRad) after 120 seconds of exposure. assays with Opti 1 medium (Univercell) in coated Cells (500,0 00 were transfected with either an ON -TARGETplus non -targeting pool for controls (siNTP) or small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting MRAP2 (siMRAP2; 20 \u00b5M ; in OptiMEM (Gibco) complemented wi (Calbiochem, Merck Millipore), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies) and seeded (50,000 cells/well) in 96 -wells plate coated with -coat. After 6 hours, the medium was replaced by Opti 1 medium. The day after, the medium was renewed, and 2 days after transfection, the medium was replaced by DMEM no glucose (Gibco) supplemen ted with 2% BSA fraction V (Roche Diagnostics), 50 M 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM nicotinamide (Calbiochem, Merck Millipore), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomyc in (Life Technologies) and 2.8 mM of D -glucose (Sigma). Three days after transfection, cells were rinsed with -Krebs buffer ( Univercell ) and 100 \u00b5l of Krebs 24 buffer containing 0.5 mM glucose was added to each well. After 1 hour, supernatants were collected and 100 \u00b5l of Krebs buffer containing 16.7 mM glucose was added. After 1 hour, supernatants were collected and cells were lysed using TETG buffer (20 mM Tris -HCl pH mM 1% lysates were centrifuged at 700 g, 4 \u00b0C for 5 minutes and insulin was assessed after proper dilution of the samples in water (1:16 for supernatants; 1:200 for lysates), using ELISA Human Insulin Kit (Mercodia, Uppsala, Sweden) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Absorbance data were measured, with technical duplicates of experimental triplicates. Biological experiments were repeated four times leading to 12 measurements for each condition. In these experiments, the MRAP2 knockd own was 68.5 \u00b1 7.9% using the siMRAP2. To ensure a reduced technical bias from the absorbance data, the technical duplicates' average absorbance was kept when the relative error was lower than 20% among the technical duplicates (this threshold being based on the observed distribution of the technical relative errors over 100 experiments). Fold changes of insulin secretion ( i.e. secretion at stimulatory glucose levels divided by secretion at basal glucose levels) were then computed. Fold change of insulin se cretion for siMRAP2 was analyzed using a linear regression adjusted for experimental conditions (operator and date). Statistical analyses for association studies: Among adults, we performed a case -control study for 'obesity' or 'overweight and obesity', ad justed for age, sex, and the presence of type 2 diabetes (controls were adults with normal weight ). Among children and adolescents, we performed a case -control study for 'obesity', adjusted for age and sex (controls were children/adolescents with normal weight ). Using the MiST method36, the rare variants were analyzed as a single cluster. MiST provided a score statistic S() for the mean effect () of the cluster, and a score statistic S() for the heterogeneous effect () of the cluste r. 25 Let the equation of the model be: =+ , where Y and X were the phenotype and the matrix of covariates, respectively. Z was a vector of ones repeated n times, with n the number of rare variants in MRAP2 , so = =1. As none of the association studies was significantly heterogeneous ( P > 0.25), we only showed the p -value associated with the mean effect () of the cluster. URLs: Type 2 Diabetes Knowledge Portal.
