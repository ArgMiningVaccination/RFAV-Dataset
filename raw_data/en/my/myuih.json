Trauma, emotional and mental stress, false belief systems, physical distress, environmental stress, and other blocks to our personal growth can be stored in the energy fields of our bodies, impacting our ability to function at our full potential. Energetic healing facilitates the healing process by clearing blocks in the energy fields, repairing and rebalancing the energy. In doing so, the body can move to its optimal level of balance from where it is able to access its inherent ability to heal itself. Energetic healing can also help identify \"issues\" before they manifest as pain or similar distortions in the physical body. It opens our consciousness to the areas we need to work through and heal in order to bring our lives into balance and maintain health, harmony and vitality. What is Energy? How is it connected to my ill-health? Quantum physics has acknowledged that we are all made up of energy, as is everything around us. It is the most basic building block of life, but like the air we breathe most people can't see it. Energy flows through everything and creates everything. Even our thoughts and emotions are energy. It is just a difference in the vibrational frequency of energy that gives us the illusion of substance and separation, rather like water moving from solid ice at slower vibration, to fluids and then to steam at higher vibrations. Our personal energies are delicately balanced and we can become sick or feel \"not quite right\" when our energy flows are disturbed or blocked. Energy imbalances can result from both internal and external factors. External factors impacting our energy systems include: environmental stresses & toxins geopathic phenomena astrological phenomena nutrition exercise posture Internal factors impacting our energy system include: trauma phobias anxiety & stress childhood programming limiting beliefs neurological, biochemical, and structural imbalances existential fears and limiting spiritual beliefs experiences and situations that are not fulfilling or in harmony with our needs RATES SINGLE SESSION $79.99 MONTHLY SESSION $64.99 MONTHLY SESSION IS A 6 MONTH CONTRACT FOR DISCOUNTED RATE - SESSIONS MAY BE INTERCHANGED FOR 60 MINUTE MASSAGES.
