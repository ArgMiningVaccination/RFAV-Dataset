Getting vaccinated is the best way to prevent hepatitis A. Other ways to avoid hepatitis A: - Boil water or drink bottled water in places where the water may not be clean. - Eat cooked foods and fruits that you can peel.

Shellfish may live in dirty water. - Use condoms correctly and every time you have sex. - Clean hands often. What about pregnancy? Hepatitis A vaccine does not contain live virus, so the risk to the baby is expected to be low. However, the safety of hepatitis A vaccination during pregnancy is not known. The risk of the vaccination should be weighed against the risk for hepatitis A in pregnant women. Ask your health care provider if the vaccine is right for you.
