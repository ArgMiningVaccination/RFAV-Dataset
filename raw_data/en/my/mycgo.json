WCHC is committed to provide patients and families with healthcare services in a \"one-shop stop\" layout including primary care, dental care, mentalhealth, women's' health, and pediatric care. WCHC currently serves populations within its clinic locations of Hamtramck and Wayne, Michigan. WCHC strives to deliver culturally appropriate, personalized, and necessary care through their Patient-Centered Medical Home model.This project seeks to utilize data gathering and analysis to improve internal staff work flow at the Hamtramck clinic location, and to highlight key statistical information to assist in the development of aHealth Resource and Services Administration (HRSA) 2020 grant.HRSA Grant1.Examined demographics, health statistics and past community health needs assessment on Hamtramck and Wayne County.2.Utilized UDS Mapper web tool to create service area map for WCHC3.Developed web database of collected data and visualized it into graphical formats4.Reviewed collected data with grant team and determined key statistics5.Assisted in the development of Service Area Competition Grant NarrativeStaff Work Flow Improvement 1.Observed daily medical huddle with internal staff from October 8-24, 2019 2.Determined preliminary gaps in communication among staff members3.Observed daily work flow of Medical Assistants (n=5) from patient check-in to check-out4.Developed anonymous survey (n=10) on daily huddle experience and distributed among staff members5.Collected survey responses, analyzed survey results, and synthesized all collected data6.Presented findings to staff at huddle and recommended next steps Service Area Map of Hamtramck Work Flow quantitative and qualitative data collection methods appropriate for a given public health context.XInterpret results of data analysis for public health research, policy, or practice.XCommunicate audience-appropriate public health content, both in writing and through oral presentation.XSelect communication strategies for difference audiences and sectors.XAssess and interpret community specific trends from quantitative and qualitative data (risks and benefits to the community, health, and resources, needs, etc.).XCompetencies1.HRSA GrantHamtramck is defined as a medically underserved area with a large immigrant population (50.8%1). A majority of households (19.5%1) have an income below $10,000 which dwarfs Wayne County (12.1%1). Key features including the unemployment rate (12.9%), poverty rate (49.1%), and the uninsured population (15.2%) follow these trends. Hamtramck has a 20/26 Health Professional Shortage Area score with approximately 66 primary care physicians per 100000 residents in Wayne County. Examination of relevant health statistics and the community health needs assessment revealed unique health needs within childhood lead poisoning, immigrant health coverage, and chronic disease management (e.g. high blood pressure). 2.Staff Work Flow ImprovementStaff work flow is primarily hindered by insufficient engagement among staff in team huddles and a lack of structure within these meetings. Introductory findings from the work flow observation and survey (n=10) revealed:1.Staff recommendations to have a set agenda (60%) and to increase engagement (50%)2.Dissatisfaction in lack of set huddle time (70%)3.Majority (60%) of staff view the huddles as partially effectivePatient TypeChief ComplaintFollow-UpTranslatorImmunizationTotal Time with MA Provider for the Health Center Program Service Area Competition for medically underserved populationsMaintain statistical database for future grant applications2.Staff Work Flow ImprovementSchedule daily huddles each morning at 9:00am, and the first patient at 9:30amDistribute patients evenly among MAs to promote structure and encourage engagement in team huddlesDevelop agenda for following day in the afternoon and distribute among team membersc1. United States Census Bureau INTRODUCTIONINTRODUCTION METHODSMETHODSThe Karmanos Cancer Institute (KCI) is a National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated comprehensive cancer center academically affiliated with Wayne State University. The Office of Cancer Health Equity and Community Engagement (OCHECE) at KCI been awarded funding from the NCI via the P30 grant to work with the National Outreach Network (NON) in addressing cancer health disparities among a target population - African Americans in the metropolitan Detroit area. This is to be done via the dissemination of culturally targeted educational materials based on toolkits provided by the Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities (CRCHD) and the NCI. Materials will be tailored to increase cancer clinical trial participation among African-Americans and to increase knowledge about high-risk HPV types and intention to vaccinate. Two intervention studies will be conducted Cancer clinical trials A pre-intervention survey (figure 1) will be administered through Qualtrics to obtain quantitative and qualitative data on target population demographics, knowledge of cancer clinical trials, and intention to participate. The intervention consists of an educational video addressing cancer clinical trials participation, and provides detailed information on their features, including common myths. The initial educational video was presented to a Karmanos Cancer Action Council (CAC), consisting of cancer caregivers and survivors from our target population, to receive feedback on culturally adapting it. CAC feedback will be used to amend the script; Examples of feedback are included in 'Recommendations/Feedback' After viewing the culturally adapted educational video, a post-intervention survey will be administered via Qualtrics to re-evaluate knowledge and intention. Further post-tests and data analysis will determine whether the intervention led to a significant changes. HPV high-risk types and vaccination education The same intervention based research methods applied in the Cancer clinical trials study will be applied to HPV high-risk types and vaccination education.

Thompson, Ph.D., Associate Center Director, Community Outreach & Engagement Faculty Director DELIVERABLESDELIVERABLES RECOMMENDATIONS/FEEDBACKRECOMMENDATIONS/FEEDBACK1.Cancer Clinical Trials Initial Video One of two videos I have created during my time at the OCHECE. This initial Cancer Clinical Trials education video is based on PowerPoint slides provided by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), but with additional material scripted by, and voiced by me. The video explains clinical trials, their importance, common myths, benefits, risks, and why diversity in clinical trials is so important. The video also stresses the importance of informed consent and the protection of individual rights and private health information. I presented this video to Karmanos Cancer Action Council (CAC) members to evaluate the effectiveness of the video, and to receive feedback on culturally tailoring the material to African-Americans specifically. The feedback I have gained from them (on issues such as medical mistrust associated with Tuskegee and Henrietta Lacks) will be integrated into a final video-based intervention. This CAC meeting provided an opportunity to personally explain to a skeptical crowd why it is so important for underrepresented minorities in cancer clinical trials to be represented - that when medications or treatments are studied in only one racial/ethnic group, doctors will not know whether its safe or effective for everyone. 2.HPV Qualtrics Pre-Intervention Survey + Codebook One of four surveys I have created in my time at the OCHECE using Qualtrics. The intention of this survey is to evaluate the effectiveness of the HPV education video-based-intervention via quantitative and qualitative data collection. Intended for pre-intervention data collection, this survey serves to gather data on demographics, HPV vaccination status, knowledge, and intentions to vaccinate. The scores garnered from survey responses will be compared to at various time intervals in the future as decided by the NON and NCI.

DOI: 10.1200/JOP.2017.025288This excerpt from NCI's Cancer Clinical Trials 2020 infographic provides a visual demonstration of the disproportionate underrepresentation of racial and ethnic minorities in cancer clinical trials participation Personal Recommendations \u00d8Pre- and post-intervention surveys should be culturally tailored as well. \u00d8Pre- and post-intervention surveys should ask about obstacles or barriers to participating/vaccinating. This may reveal future outreach goals. Recommendations/Feedback from CAC members \u00d8Address medical mistrust within the black community from historical atrocities such as the Tuskegee Syphilis Study. \u00d8Clinical trial opportunities should represent positive racial targeting in order to provide equitable care. \u00d8Stress whether or not insurance companies will be receiving notice of clinical trial participation; The worry is that participating in one of these trials will cause insurance rates to either change or for future coverage to be denied. \u00d8Example copies of informed consent documents should be presented when providing cancer clinical trials education. \u00d8The language and footage used in education materials should be focused on Black individuals - rather than a range of people of color. \u00d8Address why you may be disallowed in any clinical trialIncreasing Vaccination Compliance Rate within Detroit Public Schools Community District Fatima Eid, Master in Public Health Candidate Site Preceptor: Elliot Attisha , DO BackgroundObjectives Methods Outcomes The District's Office of School Health and Wellness aims to create a safe and healthy learning environment by removing health -related barriers so that students can learn, grow and thrive. The Office of School Health and Wellness provides various services including on -site nursing services, dental services, behavioral health services, school -based health centers that can provide physical examinations with a signed parent consent, and immunizations. Within this practicum, the goal was to increase the compliance rate for vaccinations within Detroit Public Schools Community District. It is necessary that the district's compliance rate is at 90%. Create a Michigan Care Improvement Registry (MCIR) account to see which schools are out of compliance and how many students are not compliance. Reach out to every school to verify who are the MCIR users at the school. Discuss with each school the compliance rate and schedule clinics if necessary. Create partnership with the Detroit Health Department to hold immunization clinics at the schools with very low compliance rates. Send exclusion letters to families to inform the need to vaccinate children and send consent forms to register for the clinic. Create schedule for the clinics at the schools. Participate in bi -weekly conference calls with schools nurses, Detroit Health Department, and DPSCD Office of School Health and Wellness to discuss update and timeline. After the exclusion letters were sent home took their youth to update their immunizations and many parents signed the consent forms to have their children to participate in the immunization clinic at school. Students returned consent forms in order to participate in the vaccination clinic. The consent turn around rate was over 50%. As of November 2019, the school is at 93% compliance rate with vaccinations. Help Increase the vaccination compliance rate to Detroit Public Schools Community District to 90%. Ensure students receive the necessary school immunizations Create clinics with the the schools to help reach 90% compliance goal. Do a literature review in regard to vaccinations and schools. Competencies Select quantitative and qualitative data collection methods appropriate for a given public health context. Discuss the means by which structural bias, social inequities, and racism undermine health and create challenges to achieving health equity at organizational, community, and societal levels. Assess population needs, assets, and capacities that affect communities' health. Assess and interpret community specific trends from quantitative and qualitative data(risks and benefits to the community, health, and resources, needs, etc.). Transform the latest public health research findings into timely and effective knowledge, tools, applications, and policies that improve and advance the health of urban populations. Faria Tasnim Farin -MPH Candidate, Department of Family Medicine and Public Health Sciences Preceptor: Dr. Denise White Perkins, MD, PhD, Henry Ford Health System Reducing Hypertension in Young African - American Men : A Team - Based Approach for Addressing Barriers in Hypertension Management The Henry Ford Health System (HFHS) established in 1915, is a leading comprehensive, integrated health systems of the country. It provides health insurance and health care delivery, including acute, specialty, primary, and preventive care services backed by excellence in research and education. In 2017, 45% of adults in Detroit had been told by a health professional that they have high blood pressure. It is also known that 40% of African - Americans will develop hypertension at some point in their life. It affects this group more severely and at an earlier age than non African Americans. The Henry Ford Medical Group (HFMG) primary care team, has received a grant from the American College of Preventive medicine (ACPM) to develop an innovative practice -setting model for addressing barriers in hypertension management in young African -American men (Age 35 -64). A team -based approach is being used to address barriers in hypertension management in African -American Male adults. Source: Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, CDC The HFHS project team created a patient education video to explain hypertension and it's management . The video was shown to both male and female patients while waiting in exam room for their visit. A short survey for patient feedback was distributed to be completed prior to their departure .The survey assessed their view of how well the video improved their understanding of hypertension and the importance of keeping blood pressure in control. Questions assessed their plan to make a change in lifestyle to improve blood pressure control. The project team also wanted to assess whether there were workflow issues between pharmacists, nurses, and providers that help patients manage hypertension. For My Project : I have created a database to record the post -video survey data I have analyzed the data using SPSS I have revised Patient Education Material into a comprehensive booklet. I have prepared a workflow diagram using Visio after observing workflow of embedded pharmacists , nurses and physicians Better understanding about hypertension in patients , will lead to more awareness in patients. influence development of better hypertension management skills within them and make better lifestyle changes. Primary distribution of Patient Education Booklet to the internal teams have resulted positive feedback. The positive response of the internal team members is encouraging and predicts a probability of success among patients Nurses and pharmacists get most referrals from physicians and they informally communicate within each other for patient management . There is lack of collaboration between case managers and nurses/pharmacists The referral process, informal communication and lack of collaboration can be identified as barriers and there are scopes for improvement in these aspects. I would like to sincerely thank Dr. Denise White Perkins and the project team members for allowing me to have such a wonderful learning experience. I would also like to thank the MPH Practicum Team for all their support!

Researched programs that have evaluated fast food restaurants and evaluated marketing tactics to get this information out into their own communities. Developed a plan to find the best way to communicate healthy eating in the city of Dearborn through social media, working with grocery stores, libraries, etc. (Launching January 2020).HEALTHY DEARBORN Healthy Dearborn is a partnership that involves Beaumont Health, City of Dearborn, City of Dearborn Public Schools and community members that started in 2015. The goal of Healthy Dearborn is to work together to ensure the community members of Dearborn have opportunities to healthy eating and healthy living. Healthy Dearborn was created from the community health needs assessments in 2013 and 2016 conducted by Beaumont Health. The results found that the priorities in this community that needed intervention were: diabetes, heart disease, access to care and obesity. Wayne County is the least healthy county in Michigan. Healthy Dearborn was launched to intervene in these needs and to make a connection between healthy choices and the community. Five Action Teams of Healthy Dearborn Healthy Schools Healthy Worksites Healthy Foods Healthy at Play Healthy Transportation LET'S GO WALKING To effectively design an 8 -week walking campaign challenge with Mayor John O'Reilly Jr to kick off the summer (July 10, 2019 - September 10, 2019). The community challenge is free, open to anyone in the community, and incentives go to the person with the most miles walked. This challenge is used to promote healthy living and community engagement in the city of Dearborn. Our goal is to collectively walk 2,275 miles from Dearborn to Los Angeles together.LET'S GO WALKING Created a master plan of work to assign tasks for each campaign coordinator so that we could perform effectively as a team. Modeled off of the St. Clair Shores walking campaign. Designed recruitment flyers to obtain walk leaders and walk members to participate in the walk campaign through the form of social media and brochures. Engaged the community through this walking campaign. Held a walk leader recruitment meeting to discuss their role in the campaign and to have them set up their walk schedule (time, date, location, etc.). Communicated effectively to these leaders about our goals and objectives. Held a kick -off walk to start the campaign and help recruited even more members and assessed how our marketing did for the campaign. Logged the walkers miles/steps weekly in an excel spreadsheet to keep track of who walked the most miles in each group and assessed the community engagement. Helped answer emails/questions for effective communication with the walk leaders and walkers to ensure that they knew what they were doing and helped engage a connection with the community members. Attended weekly walks in different groups to engage with the community members and explored cultural elements to help to know how to assess the campaign. HEALTHY RESTAURANTS Developed in 2018 by Healthy Dearborn. Healthy Restaurants is an initiative that is recognizing businesses that provide healthy menu options for the customers. Healthy Restaurants wants to involve the community even more with healthy eating and shift the focus now on fast food restaurants for the low income community members. LET'S GO WALKING Total miles walked: 16, 891.32 miles Team with most miles walked: 6, 018.30 miles Person with most miles walked: 800 miles Total teams participating: 10 teams total Recruited walking members based on a successful communication strategy used. Designed a population -based program that will now be used for the next years to come. Completed the Healthy Play aspect of Healthy Dearborn in promoting physical activity. HEALTHY RESTAURANTS The best way to reach a low income population is not through the form of social media, but with the communication through businesses that are frequently visited grocery stores, etc. The designed pamphlet we made is now ready to be distributed throughout the community in a variety of locations for the public (Jan 2020) CONCLUSIONS Let's Go Walking was a successfully designed community campaign that was able to communicate effectively with the community while assessing the Healthy at Play aspect of the program during this 8 -week walking campaign in the Dearborn neighborhoods. Professionally worked with other team members (Sara Gleicher and Ashton Scott) in a diverse cultural neighborhood. Explored different cultural aspects such as different community organizations (LAHC and Yuri Fitness) of the City of Dearborn and advocated for the policies and programs that are improving this community such as Healthy Restaurants, Let's Go Walking, Dearborn Walk & Roll, and Open Streets. RECOMMENDATIONS Make a better and more effective way to get results from the walk leaders so that they do not have to email their walk numbers every week. Reach out to more businesses and local community centers to better advocate for the walking campaign to get more walk leaders and walk members involved. Better involve social media to engage with community.

Among tobacco users, only 35.5%of were ready to quit smoking.11of 45 (24.4%) tobacco users consumed more than one form of tobacco.Among the YLWH who used tobacco, 40.9%attempted to quit using tobacco before.Only 32.4% of the YLWH who smoked reported being advised to quit smoking by a physician or relative.36.5%of tobacco using YLWH showed interest in participating in health promotion group events such as Cooking Matters and Mindful MeditationTobacco cessation programs for YLWH should be introduced during first care appointments.Developmentally and culturally appropriate elements should be incorporated into tobacco cessation programming for YLWH.Tobacco using YLWH endorsed a variety of health promotion activities that should be incorporated into tobacco cessation programs. Planning and Executing of Naloxone (Narcan) Trainings in Wayne CountyWith specific focus OfficersINTRODUCTION METHODSFIGURESRESULTS Dudley-White, President and CEO, The Youth ConnectionThe Youth Connection Based on a 95% confidence interval, the police officers (N=217) proved to have higher scores on the post-test than the pre-test (p<0.05). Analysis of all pre-/post-test (N=1078) from January 2019-September 2019produced a p<0.05. In a majority of the trainings, there was a notable shift in the officer's attitudes of stereotyping those who overdose versus understanding that it can, and is, happening in diverse populations. After contacting DPD-NPOs, TYC was able to secure mandatory trainings for all police officers in the training academy starting in July 2020. The Drug Take Back event collected a total of 177.5 pounds of prescription pills. 1.Assess and interpret community specific trends from quantitative and qualitative data (risks and benefits to the community, health, and resources, needs, etc). I.We train officers because they often are a first responder. We also focus trainings on senior citizen because the surveillance data from TYC's target zip codes (48203, 48204, 48205) showed significantly higher rates of people overdosing and dying from opioids in those 55 and up. 2.Transform the latest public health research findings into timely and effective knowledge, tools, applications, and policies that improve and advance the health of urban populations.I.Through the statistical analysis performed, I am able to prove our trainings have proved to improve the knowledge of the community and those who serve it. The Youth Connection (TYC) is a 501 (c)(3) non-profit organization located in eastside Detroit.1TYC aims to provide \"high quality programs, advocacy and supporting services\" to the youth and their families.1TYC offers employment for youth, substance abuse prevention, and other programs that promote healthy lifestyle behaviors.With the Opioid epidemic being of high concern throughout the nation, the Surgeon General passed the Standing Order for Narcan. Narcan is the antagonist that temporarily reverses the effects of an opioid overdose.2Narcan, to our most current knowledge, is not addictive and is a safe mechanism to assist in saving lives from opioid overdoses. With the Standing Order, people can receive a prescription of Narcan without an individual prescription from a doctor.2TYChas partnered with the Detroit Health Department (DHD), Detroit Police Department (DPD), and the Detroit Wayne Integrative Health Network (DWIHN) to get as many members as possible equipped with Narcan.

Respondents were asked both about the characteristics of providers, as well as specific services. Responses indicated that respondents were most concerned about the involvement of their partner and being treated with respect. Significant differences were found between Detroit and non-Detroit residents on sharing the race or cultural background of the provider. Many of the expressed desires of the community reflected support with prenatal education, natural childbirth practices, and ongoing support postpartum.Survey respondents were asked about their previous experiences with prenatal care and birth, including services provided, satisfaction with care, and birth practices and outcomes. Individuals who had the care of a midwife or doula reported more satisfaction with their birth experience than those who did not. Having a midwife provide prenatal care and/or provide services at birth was significantly associated with:Having a vaginal birthHaving no pain medicationNot having an epiduralLaboring in a tubHaving a partner present at the birthHaving a doula present at the birthBeing less likely to birth in a hospitalBeing more likely to birth in a birth centerBeing more likely to birth at homeBeing less likely to have a cesarean sectionBeing more satisfied with prenatal careWhite/Caucasian women were more likely than African American/Black women to have had a midwife provide prenatal care or to have a midwife or doula provide care at childbirth. White/Caucasian women reported higher satisfaction. Women with higher income reported higher satisfaction with both prenatal care and birth experienceWomen with higher education reported higher satisfaction with prenatal care. Community Engagement Needs Assessment Program Design Program Launch Implementation EvaluationWayne County Healthy Communities (WCHC) is a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) based in Hamtramck and Wayne that provides services to the surrounding, largely underserved community. This FQHC sees patients regardless of their ability to pay, and therefore sees a mainly Medicaid patient population. WCHC provides multiple services to their patient base, including primary care, dentistry, behavioral health, women's health, and pediatric care. The goal is to provide coordinated, efficient, and individualized care focusing on a Patient Centered Medical Home model. Referral List One of the main factors in the local Health Information Exchange (HIE) policy is a complete list of current referral sites and providers. By creating this list, there is an assumption of reciprocation between WCHC and the outside referral sites. As part of the Meaningful Use (MU) criteria, patient follow-up and referral site communication is factored into provider grading metrics. Security Risk Assessment Security Risk Assessment is a component of MU that is assessed annually accounting for Protected Health Information (PHI) accessibility and security as well as HIPAA compliance, particularly focused on EMR vulnerabilities. The annual report created a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) and HIPAA audit documents. Comparison between CAP and the Business Associate Agreement, Facility Security Policy, and Change in Management Policy templates. HIPAA audit documents vs HIPAA compliance documents. These are used to quality for federal funding. Patient Portal Part of the Meaningful Use Criteria. Two providers were unable to match the secure messaging (through patient portal) MU requirements. To meet these requirements, it was necessary to actively engage with the patients to emphasize portal registration and access. Referral List This project focused on improving the quality of care provided to patients through achieving state and federal quality standards and furthering partnerships between local and regional organizations. The goal of the work was on increasing primary care access and increasing the efficiency of documentation. Public Health Competencies Public Health & Health Care Systems 5. Compare the organization, structure and function of health care, public health and regulatory systems across national and international settings 6. Discuss the means by which structural bias, social inequities and racism undermine health and create challenges to achieving health equity at organizational, community and societal levels Planning & Management to Promote Health 10. Explain basic principles and tools of budget and resource management 11. Select methods to evaluate public health programs Policy in Public Health 15. Evaluate policies for their impact on public health and health equity Communication 19. Communicate audience-appropriate public health content, both in writing and through oral presentation 20. Describe the importance of cultural competence in communicating public health content Interprofessional Practice 21. Perform effectively on interprofessional teams Security Risk Assessment Sample Patient Portal Access Referral List HIE involves ongoing communication with outside organizations, including Great Lakes Health Connect. The full referral list should help patient compliance by easing follow up with outside organizations. The referral list given to patients has providers listed by specialty and has name and location given so the patient is able to choose for himself or herself. Ideally, this new workflow design will close the referral loops by using larger databases provided by Great Lakes Connect. Security Risk Assessment The updated HIPAA compliance documents were edited by multiple providers over the course of the last year and addressed specific issues in the 2018 HIPAA audit. The series of templates addressed the CAP areas of weakness, however they were not as refined as the HIPAA compliance documents. Therefore, the templates and HIPAA audit forms were finalized to cover the areas in the CAP and the HIPAA audit without creating redundancies or gaps. Patient Portal In order to meet the MU requirements for select providers it was necessary to meet with patients and to help them register for the patient portal. This access should help the patients message providers and provide them with access to their own PHI. The full referral list was created with eClinicalWorks (eCW) software. After which, the list was printed, then active and high priority providers were marked in conjunction the WCHC Care Coordinator Manager. This list was then compiled into an excel sheet accessible to providers to give to patients. Raw referral list with high-priority, active providers selected Corrective Action Plan Example of Meaningful Use comparison for a sample provider The 2018 CAP prioritized various weakness in the electronic infrastructure at WCHC. These weaknesses were then addressed by Amaal Haimout, the clinic director, with suggestions. These suggestions tended to be applications of various templates, which then needed to be compared against HIPAA compliance documents to avoid redundancies and gaps in coverage. Excel Sheet with referrals separated by specialty Assessment of Motivational Enhancement System for Adherence (MESA) Project INTRODUCTION DELIVERABLES RESULTS CONCLUSIONSJazmine L Mui-Blackmon, Master of Public Health Candidate Wayne State University Prevention Team, Preceptor: Angulique Y. Outlaw, PhD The Wayne State University Prevention team (W'SUP) provides HIV prevention and treatment services to youth (ages 13 to 24 years). The Detroit facility assists the youth of Detroit and the surrounding metropolitan areas. The focus of this team is achieved through a number of projects including the Motivational Enhancement System for Adherence for Youth Starting Antiretroviral Treatment (MESA). This is a multi-site project with the bulk of participants coming from the Detroit area, however there are five other sites across the country. As complete prevention of new cases is not feasible at this time it is important to focus on medication adherence as a way to preserve quality of life in those who are living with HIV. The goal of the MESA project is to test a program which consists of two sessions of motivational intervention to promote ART adherence. The program exists online and requires for the data reported there to be exported and added manually to other programs for statistical analysis. The MESA project had 139 participants as of November 1,2019 who had completed the baseline portion. Demographic information of the participants includes age, BMI, birth sex, gender identity, sexual identity, racial and ethnic identity, education, child status, job status, and living situation. Important to comparing the control group and intervention group is ensuring they are statistically similar.Literature Review: It is important that healthcare workers work with patients and families in a way that is adaptable based on the individual. This is because of the notable impact mental illness, daily schedules, and disruption in regular environment have on adherence levels, even in those who have been educated and are aware of how important adherence is. More focus should be placed on treating comorbid mental illnesses in sequence with regular mediation regimens. Assisting individuals in obtaining necessary medication is also important, both making it affordable and obtainable.Competencies Literature Review Demographic Data Analysis Analyze quantitative and qualitative data using biostatistics, informatics, computer-based programming and software, as appropriate.

The two groups are similar enough that comparison between the two groups will not be biased by those demographic measures. The results from initial analysis show that there is higher adherence in the intervention group, and as the control group is statistically the more educated of the two groups, it appears that education likely has no effect on adherence. LITERATURE REVIEW SOURCESCONCLUSIONSRESULTS FIGURES INTRODUCTIONMental Health Predictive Values on Psychological Vulnerability Risk Score from the Lichtenberg Financial Decision -Making Rating Scale (LFDRS) Helen -Wilma Nnoke , MPH Candidate, Wayne State University LaToya Hall, MSW, Institute Of Gerontology, Wayne State University Thomas Jankowski, PhD, Institute Of Gerontology, Wayne State University METHODS-Of the independent variables, GAI was the scale that showed the most significance regarding PV . From the analysis it had the highest R2 of 0.221 which means that GAI accounted for 22.1% of the variance in PV . In regard to the regression, GAI also showed to be the most significant at the p=0.05 level. When the other variables were added to the model, they showed no significance. -Therefore, individuals who have high anxiety as demonstrated by their GAI total score will also be more psychologically vulnerable and as a result, these individuals will be more susceptible to financial scams. -In the future, it is important that a bigger sample size is used to show if there is really statistical significance between the independent and dependent variable, and also give more power to the analysisThe Institute of Gerontology at Wayne State University is a research - focused institution with a mission statement which states that research in social behavioral and cognitive neuroscience regarding issues of aging and urban health is their main concern. This research includes having programs such as the Successful Aging through Financial Empowerment (SAFE) program. Older adults and the caregivers who are enrolled in this program receive one -on-one coaching services to increase awareness about the different scamming and identity theft techniques, how to identify them, protect and report these forms of financial abuse. The SAFE program's main goals include helping older adults who have been financially exploited recover from this abuse both financially and emotionally. This is done by having one -on-one coaching services with these older adults and their caregivers on the different scamming and identity theft techniques, identification, protection and reporting. By doing this, the physical, emotional and cognitive health of these older adults and their caregivers is protected, and their financial literacy is strengthened. This project sought to find if there was a relationship between mental or emotional health predictive values such as the Geriatric Anxiety Index (GAI), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) in relations to Psychological Vulnerability a subscale of the Lichtenberg Financial Decision -Making Rating Scale (LFDRS). -Hypothesis: High scores on the GAI, GDS and PSS would also mean highly psychologically vulnerable participants and therefore these individuals would be more susceptible to financial exploitation. -Obtained data from the SAFE program with n=53 -Examined the LFDRS and chose Psychological Vulnerability (PV) as the dependent variable from the other subscales which included Financial Situational Awareness, Susceptibility to Undue Influence and Intellectual Factors -Assessed the emotional health of the participants as the independent variable by using the Geriatric Anxiety Index (GAI) scale, Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) -Used SPSS to perform multiple regressions to determine if there was any significance between the LFDRS subscale PV and emotional health (GAI, GDS, PSS) as hypothesized -H0= The independent variables have no effect on the dependent variable HA= The independent variables have an effect on the dependent variable -The participants demographic had a mean age of around 68 years, and most participants had around 13 years of education. As for gender, most of the participants were female (74.5%) and 73.5% identified as African - American -After analysis, R2 GAI total = 0.221, R2 GDS total = 0.138, R2 PSS total = 0.177 -When a multiple regression was performed GAI was significant (0.001) at the 0.05 level but when GDS and PSS were added to the regression, there appeared to be no significance at the 0.05 level, leading to the acceptance of the null hypothesis Competencies Foundational : -Analyze quantitative andqualitative data using biostatistics, -Communicate audience content, both . -Assess population needs, assets andcapacities thataffect communities' health Concentration : -Assess and interpret community specific trends from quantitative and qualitative data (risks and benefits to the community, health, and resources, needs, etc.). -Transform the latest public health research findings into timely and effective knowledge, tools, applications, and policies that improve and advance the health of urban populations. GAI as the only predictor showed significance but adding the other predictors into the regression made the model overall non - significant. GAI alone accounted for 22.1% variance on PV adding the other predictors only caused a slight increase in variance An increase in GAI leads to an "}
