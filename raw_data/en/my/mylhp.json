In a broader sense, it is healing-oriented medicine that takes into account the whole person (body, mind and spirit), including all aspects of lifestyle, and makes use of all appropriate therapies, both conventional and alternative. The field is more than 10 years old and it is the only one of the emerging models to explicitly encompass the integration of therapeutics that, until recently, were the sole purview of complementary and alternative medicine. FUNCTIONAL MEDICINE is the future of conventional medicine currently available. It seeks to identify and address the root causes of disease, and views the body as one integrated system, not a collection of independent organs divided up according to medical specialties. It treats the whole system, not just the symptoms (Dr. Mark Hyman). There's a huge gap between research and the way doctors practise.
