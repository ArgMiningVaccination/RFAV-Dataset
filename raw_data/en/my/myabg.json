Of course, substituting coconut milk for breast milk or infant formula is a no-go. However, you may add a little coconut milk to the weaning baby's or toddler's diet. Coconut milk is obtained from mature coconut pulp. Its peculiar taste and creamy texture make it a common choice in savory and sweet recipes. Although it cannot substitute breastmilk, it has nutritional and therapeutic properties. Therefore, it is best to opt for fresh coconut milk prepared at home rather than canned coconut milk. Read on to know the benefits of coconut milk and some interesting recipes with coconut milk for babies and toddlers. When Can You Introduce Coconut Milk To Your Infant? Babies older than 12 months may have calcium-fortified coconut milk as the main drink [(1)](https://what0-18.nhs.uk/professionals/gp-primary-care-staff/safety-netting-documents-parents/milk-free-diet-babies). If you wish to introduce coconut milk sooner, adding it to the baby's weaning food is suitable [ (2)](https://what0-18.nhs.uk/professionals/gp-primary-care-staff/safety-netting-documents-parents/milk-free-diet-babies). You could try coconut milk-based cheese, [yogurt and desserts](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/yummilicious-yogurt-recipes-for-your-baby_00335737/) for babies older than six months occasionally [ (3)](https://www.gloshospitals.nhs.uk/media/documents/Cows_Milk_Free_Diet_Information_for_Babies_and_Children_original_2_2.pdf). In any case, consult a pediatrician before giving coconut milk to the baby. Nutritional Value Of Coconut Milk The nutritional composition and qualities of coconut milk vary depending on the quality of coconut pulp. Coconut milk sold as a dairy alternative, that is, a milk substitute, is fortified with nutrients, such as calcium and vitamin D. One fluid ounce (30.5g) of coconut milk fortified with calcium, vitamins A, B12, and [D](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/vitamin-d-for-babies_00333436/) offers the following of Agriculture and World Health Organization Coconut milk is frequently viewed as a lactose-free option for infants who are intolerant to lactose. However, whether to use coconut milk for a baby is a decision you need to make with a pediatrician. Some other dairy-free alternatives are soy milk, rice milk, oats milk, almond milk, and hemp milk. It is worth noting that vegan milk, including coconut milk, is becoming increasingly popular as a nutritious and sustainable alternative to traditional cow's milk. Possible Health Benefits Of Coconut Milk For Babies Coconut milk has nutritional elements, such as medium-chain triglycerides and bioactive compounds that could benefit health over time [ (6)](https://www.ijcmas.com/6-11-2017/S.%20Kokilavani,%20et%20al.pdf) [ (7)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7422486/). Below are some notable benefits of coconut milk that a baby may reap. - Offers nutrients: Coconut milk is calorie-rich, has high amounts of saturated fat and minerals [(8)](http://article.sciencepublishinggroup.com/pdf/10.11648.j.ijnfs.20160506.13.pdf). This nutritional profile could make it a good choice for babies who need these nutrients to maintain their rapid growth and development. The nourishment provided by coconut milk is beneficial for the overall health and well-being of babies. - Improves digestion: Coconut milk is considered to improve digestion and [alleviate constipation](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/newborn-baby-constipation-causes-symptoms-remedies_00802473/)through its high water content and bioactive compounds [(9)](https://jamaicahospital.org/newsletter/the-benefits-of-coconut-milk/). However, clinical evidence to support this theory is limited. - Strengthens immunity: The nutritional components of coconut milk could stimulate the immune system [(10)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6723250/). Also, it contains bioactive compounds possessing antioxidant properties. The medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), such as lauric acid, present in coconut milk, may help fight [infect](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/bacterial-infections-in-babies-or-infants_00332320/)io [ns](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/bacterial-infections-in-babies-or-infants_00332320/)and illnesses [(11)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279557100_Study_of_antioxidant_activity_and_physicochemical_properties_of_coconut_milk_Pati_santan_in_Malaysia). - Supports brain development: Research shows that coconut milk contains considerable amounts of saturated fatty acid [(10)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6723250/). These fatty acids may support the baby's healthy [brain](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/foods-that-will-boost-your-babys-brainpower_00329675/)development in the long run. Besides these, coconut milk may also reduce inflammation and promote heart health over time. Possible Side Effects Of Coconut Milk For Babies Although coconut milk offers certain benefits, its use among babies is not promoted. One cup of coconut milk provides 0.51g of protein, which is significantly lower than whole cow milk, which contains 7.69g of protein [ (12)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279557100_Study_of_antioxidant_activity_and_physicochemical_properties_of_coconut_milk_Pati_santan_in_Malaysia). Also, coconut milk is high in saturated fat, which may fill your baby's little tummy and suppress their appetite for breastfeeding, formula milk, and other foods. It will be a good idea to keep saturated fat intake to a minimum. Commercial coconut milk, usually sold as a milk substitute, is often diluted and may contain artificial sweeteners and thickeners [ (10)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6723250/). These compounds may not be good for the baby's health, and parents might want to avoid them. Coconut is also a potential allergen though the allergy is not as common. Note: If you wish to use coconut milk for cooking, use canned coconut milk specifically made for cooking purposes. Precautions To Take While Using Coconut Milk For Babies Here are some precautions to observe while using coconut milk for babies. - Prefer to buy packaged coconut milk from a reputable and trusted brand. Look for no-sugar options fortified with essential nutrients, such as calcium and vitamin D. - Introduce coconut milk as a part of other foods, such as mash, puree, or porridge. Keep the intake occasional as its protein and calcium content is not enough. Being rich in calories and fats, it can keep your baby full for longer and suppress its appetite. - Begin by feeding a teaspoon of coconut milk as a part of food preparation and gradually increase the intake to a tablespoon and then to two. - After ingesting coconut milk, if the baby experiences discomfort or shows signs of sensitivity or intolerance, discontinue feeding, and try later. - Allergy after eating coconut is rare, but the allergic reaction after touching coconut, called contact dermatitis, is relatively common [(13)](https://www.allergy.org.au/patients/food-allergy/coconut-allergy). If the baby has an existing dermatitis condition or a family history of skin allergies, consult a doctor before introducing coconut milk. - Cross-reactivity of coconut with walnut and hazelnut has been reported. Most individuals with a tree nut allergy can eat coconut and its products [(14)](https://www.anaphylaxis.org.uk/knowledgebase/coconut/). Nevertheless, if your baby has nut or other food allergies, consult a doctor before introducing coconut milk. - Serve coconut milk as a drink to toddlers occasionally. Plain coconut milk, coconut milkshake, and coconut milk smoothie are some options to try. - Keep the intake of coconut milk occasional, even for older toddlers. Toddlers older than two years should consume low-fat foods for effective weight management and optimum heart health [(15)](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001979.htm#:~:text=Children%20over%20age%20of%202,to%2040%25%20of%20total%20calories.).

Frequently Asked Questions 1. Which is healthier for my baby, coconut or almond milk? Babies under the age of 1 year are suggested not to drink almond milk [(16)](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/food-types/milk-and-dairy-nutrition/). Coconut milk-based food, on the other hand, can be recommended to babies along with other foods after the baby reaches six months of age [(3)](https://www.gloshospitals.nhs.uk/media/documents/Cows_Milk_Free_Diet_Information_for_Babies_and_Children_original_2_2.pdf). However, consult a specialist before including them in the diet, as they are considered food allergens. 2. Can coconut milk hurt the stomach of my baby? Coconut milk may hurt a baby's stomach due to saturated fat content that may cause trouble with digestion [(17)](https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/heal/Publications/caring-for-children-manual.pdf). 3. Is it better to give my infant coconut water or coconut milk? Coconut milk contains more protein, provides more energy than coconut water, and can benefit your growing baby. However, coconut water is rich in minerals such as sodium, potassium, and calcium and can help replenish the electrolytes and support bone growth [(18)](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/170172/nutrients) [(19)](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/170174/nutrients). In addition, coconut water is found naturally inside the fruit, whereas coconut milk may mostly be processed. Although both beverages offer certain benefits, they must be fed to infants in moderation along with other more preferable sources of nutrition, such as cow's milk, after consulting with a pediatrician [(20)](https://healthydrinkshealthykids.org/app/uploads/2019/09/HDHK_One_Pager_Water.pdf) [(21)](https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/publication/FS411). Coconut milk for babies is an energy-dense beverage that they can consume along with other weaning foods. Feeding coconut milk to babies under 12 months is strongly discouraged. However, toddlers can consume a cup of coconut milk as their main drink or as a part of other foods such as soups, curries, porridge, and cakes. But never replace whole cow's milk or breast milk with coconut milk since it lacks certain essential nutrients that babies and toddlers need for proper growth and development. Instead, include coconut milk in moderation as a part of a balanced diet to enjoy its benefits.
