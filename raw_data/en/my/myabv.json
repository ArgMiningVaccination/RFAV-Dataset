Bloomsbury Street, London, W.C.I. Ffiiftted lo Great Brttaitt\u00bbThe Centenary of Rudolf Steiner's Birth Anthroposophy. a way of thought rather than a body of dogma, springs from the work and teaching of Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925). He spoke of it as \" a path of knowledge, to guide the spiritual in the human being to the spiritual in the universe The aim of this Annual is to publish writings which bring the outlook of Anthroposophy to bear on ques tions and activities relevant to the present time. The title derives from a reference by Rudolf Steiner to an old Persian legend. \"Djemjdid was a king who led his people from the north towards Iran, and who received from the God, whom he called Ahura Mazdao, a golden dagger, by means of which he was to full his mission on earth .... It represents a force given to man whereby he can act upon and transform external natureA. C. Harwood F o r s o m e r e a s o n t h e w o r l d h a s c o m e t o l o v e c e n t e n a r i e s . N odoubt they are protable affairs to newspapers and journalists who make the most of tibem. But they could hardly do so unless there existed a general feeling that a hundred years makes a good time for taking stock, and perhaps especially the rst hxmdred years. An event is then sufcientiiy far away to see its relatiras: a person has shed the unessential and reveals his true nature. \"A poet,\" said Lord Melbourne, \" should be dead: then you can get his works and be done with him.\" If he has been dead a himdred years, you can be done with him all the better. Rudolf Steiner has not been dead a hundred years, and it was part of his own teaching that the centenary of a birth has not thesame spiritual signiance as the centenary of a death. But the centenary of his birth (Februaiy 27, 1961) will provide (it is hoped) an opportunity for bringing his work to the attention of a wider public; and, just because they will attempt to do this, his followersMe bound to appraise the situation of Steiner's work and teaching in the world to-day in a fresh light In writing of his childhood, Steiner describes himself as brought up among the advanced technical inventions of the age\u2014the country station with a few trains a day and the electric telegraph in the stationmaster's ofce. We can hardly help contrasting this environ ment with that of the typical modem child, warmed by an electf c re as he sits in front of the television, with a stream of cars racing past his door, and jet planes and satellites overhead. And all thisthe result of a direction of thought which Steiner saw to be one sided and dangerous, and which he set out to redress. It was not tihat he objected to the type of thinking. On the contrary, he welcomed its clarity and precision and many of the new conceptions with which it was endeavouring to unriddle the secrets of the world. Foremost among these was the idea of evolution, which, though not invented by the nineteenth century, certainly then attained a stature and signicance unknown before. Steiner from the rst maintained that for fose who could grasp the life of the individual as spiritual form, it called for antecedentforms no less than for a developed physical organism. The id^of evolution as applied to the individual leads therefore inevitably to the idea of reincarnation, which alone can provide the necessary antecedent forms. But, alas, his contemporaries could not grasp the idea of spiritual forms: they were too immersed in seeing life in terms of material forces. And although the denition of material forces has undergone an immense change, the orthodox scientists 1still seek a unied ' material' explanation of all phenomena. T o celebrate the ' centenary' of the famous encounter of Huxley and Bishop Wilberforce, the Observer recently staged another duel between Julian Huxley and Canon Mascall, in which Huxley dignies the experience of consciousness with the name of psychic-metabolism. The original controversy supplies a pretty , example of how two apparently complete opponents may be united at a deeper level of which they are unconscious. For, in the course of the argument, Huxley said to Wilberforce: \" Y ou know that you yourself were originally a little piece of matter no bigger than the end of this gold pencil case.\" Wilberforce did not deny his origin as a little piece of matter, or assert that his spiritual self descended from spiritual worlds.^ * The incident is typical of the climate of thought with which Steiner had to contend. It was natural that as he developed his powers of spiritual perception and saw more and more clearly the spiritual origin of things, the gulf between his 'spiritual science'and * natural science' seemed to grow wider and wider. Sometimes he went out of his way to build what he had to say on to recognised external facts or to develop his argument logically . At other times the revelations which he was impelled to give came flooding in such a torrent that they were left to rely on their own ring of truth, which can indeed be more potent and convincing than the closest chain of reasoning. He certainly expected his followers to nd a way of presenting these revelations so that they would be acceptable to the ' healthy human reason' of the ordinary unprejudiced mind. A supreme example of this is to be found in the last presentation of Anthro- posophy which he gave to members of the Anthroposophical Society in 1924.2 At the beginning of this series of lectures, he says he cannot speak as though Anthroposophy had not been developing for twenty years. An absolute beginning cannot be made again and again. He then sketches a new (and difcult) approach to the subject. The rst lecture contends {inter alia) that in the presence of deaf every man unconsciously feels that nature which creates all other forms can only destroy the human form, so that the question inevitably forms itself: whence comes the human form? Thesecond lecture is concerned mainly with two gateways to the spiritual world, the gate of the moon and the gate of the sun. The ^ 1 Similarly, in the Observer controversy, Canon Mascall accepts theorthodox ' natural science view that man derives from an ape-like stock\u2014 a viw which requires considerable modication to make it compatible with the Christian teaching of the Fall and the Redemption. 2 Formerly published under the title Anthroposophy, an Introduction now being republished as Anthroposophy, an Approach.former is to be found under the sign of necessity. All that brings a man to certain necessary experiences, such as the meeting with someone of importance to his life, proceeds from the moon. All that belongs to freedom, where he chooses what he will make of the experience, comes from the sun. Such ideas cannot be spoken of except through deep experiences of their reality in fe speaker's life. The conscious experience of the anthroposophist is to address itself to the unconscious experience of his hearers. But it is only the deep which calls to the deep. Reader or listener demand the ring of experience in the words of writer or speaker.The presentation and interpretation of Anthroposophy will therefore inevitably depend more and more on the individual. It is signicant that there is now a small but growing collection of booksissued by publishers of repute which draw their inspiration from Steiner's work, but are essentially the expression of the author'sown character , research and outlook.^ But there is, ^d for a very long time will be, the need for a direct exposition of Steiner's work and views. In one way this is easier than it was during his own lifetime. For as far as the inner life of man is concerned, there has been\u2014as Steiner prophesied there would be\u2014a new awareness of spiritual things, so that it is far easier than in Steiner's own lifetime to speak of such matters as reincarnation and karma, of the mystical life, and of the Mysteries. But in the sphere of nature materialism has become deeply entrenched. It is even a popfar theory to-day that natural science has served the cause of religion by removing God from the natural world\u2014where He is not and never was\u2014^so that He can be seen in His rightful place, namely in personal relations\u2014which includes the relation of man to God as well as that of man to man. There is, of course, some truth in this contention. There is an aspect of nature which has been handed over to impersonal forces\u2014in order to provide a eld for the development of human freedom. But it is difcult to break through the new scientic orthodoxy with the view that world and man have a spiritual origin or to give a hierarchical structure to the universe which rst the Protestants and then the scientists have emptied of divine beings. * There is, however, one primary difculty in the presentation of Steiner's work to the public which the Centenary wofd seem especially to mark out for a concentrated attack. Steiner s knowledge was gained through Initiation, and the modern mind knows nothing of the Initiate. Anyone who hears of the imniense varietyof subjects which Steiner handled, and of the elds in which he 1 E.g., Owen Bareld, Saving the Appearances; Russell Davenport, The Dignity of Man; Karl Konig, Das Mongolismus; F. Winkler, Man, the Bridge between Two Worlds. 2 3worked, instinctively feels that there is something preposterous inthe claims his followers make for him. The day of the universal genius has long passed; it is only by intense specialisation thatknowledge advances to-day . How can one man speak with authorityon philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, history, religion, miner alogy , botany , zoology , etc., as well as putting his nger in the pieof education, agriculture, architecture, drama, medicine; and the Lord ^ows what else? The claim is ridiculous\u2014without the idea of initiation. It is therefore of primary importance to establish the fact that man has latent in him possibilities of perception and con ception other than those on which the modem view of the world is built. These possibilities have not, of course, existed only in posse in the past. In different forms and degrees they were realised in the Mysteries, and in the persons of the Initiates who were the leaders of ancient civilisations. It is therefore proper and necessary to speak of Rudolf Steiner as bringing about a renaissance of Mystery Wisdom. But Ais Renaissance has so new a character that it is ^er to emphasise in Steiner the character of the Forerunner. Itis only in his capacity as the Forerunner of a new consciousness, able to survey human and cosmic affairs from a new altitude, that the immense scope of his work can be justied. To place him at the point where the renaissance of ancient powers of cognition becomes the birth of new is to see him in the true historical per spective\u2014^which is the proper task of a Centenary. There is a growing awareness to-day \u2014 it owes not a little to Julian Huxley\u2014that natural evolution has come to an end on the earth, and that the only being who can evolve further\u2014through his own efforts\u2014is manlf himself. It is the task of his followers to point to Rudolf Steiner as the man who has made that step in evolution\u2014^the great forerunner who has opened the new path for mankind.The Position of Anthroposophy among the Sciences Rudolf Steiner A Lecture, hitherto untranslated, given at the Hague (as part of a course for university graduates) on April 8,1922 * A S Anthroposophy spreads to elds where men usually seek their religious and, maybe, their moral impulses also, it encounters many persons who feel drawn towards such a spiritual stream.The modern spirit, which yesterday I allowed myself to call \" the scientic spirit\", has, in many respects, shaken old, traditional beliefs, and although many people approach the anthroposophical line of research somewhat sceptically, there are, nevertheless, vei^ many to-day whose souls have at least an inclination towards it.But it is correct to say that, in one respect, Anthroposophy encounters difculties when it would enter the elds of the various sciences. That is the particular aim of this course, and it will be my thSk to present here, in the main, the general, more comprehensive principles and results of our research, while the other lecturers will deal with special scientic elds. But precisely such an arrangement must arouse all the anti pathies\u2014^I use this word more in a theoretical than in a moral.sense\u2014^which Anthroposophy encounters from scientific quarters. I can only assure you that one who is engaged in anthroposophical research fully understands how difcult it is for a man involved in scientic work to-day to pass from the scientic attitude into Anthroposophy. Although Anthroposophy has certainly much tocorrect in present-day science, and, at the same time, when organic and spiritual elds are included, very much to add to the present material for research, it does not of itself come into conflict with current science. It accepts the justied results of science and deals with them in the way I have just described. The reverse, however, does not occur; at least, not yet\u2014as one may well understand. Anthroposophy is rejected; its results are not regarded as satisfyingthe strictly scientic criteria that one feels entitled to impose to-day . In a short lecture I shall not, of course, be able to go into allthat Anthroposophy can itself bring forward to serve as an effective fotmdation for its results. But I should like in to-day s lecture to attempt to characterise the position of Anthroposophy among thesciences, and to do this in a way that will enable you to understand * FroiB a shorthand report unrevised by the lecturer. PuUish^ hy permission of the Rudolf Steiner-Nachlassverwaltung, Dqrnaeh, Switzerland. 4 5that Anthroposophy, in laying its foundations, is as conscientious as any sdence with its own precise technique. For tWs, however, I shall have to inflict upon you somewhat remote discussions\u2014 things which in ordinary life may be called difcult but which are necessary in order to provide a certain basis for what I shall have to offer in an easier and, perhaps, more agreeable form in the next few days. \u00bb Many people to-day imagine that Anthroposophy starts somehowfrom the nebulous attitude of soul to be found in present-day movements that are really \" mystical\" or \" occultBut to ascribe to. Anthroposophy such a very questionable foundation is a com plete mistake. Only one who knows Anthroposophy only super cially, or, indeed, through its opponents, can do that. The fundamental attitude of consciousness in Anthroposophy has been drawn from that branch of present-day science which is least of all attacked in respect to its scientic character and im portance. I admit, however, that many of our adherents\u2014and opponents too\u2014^fail to perceive correcfiy what I have now to characterise by way of introduction. The position of mathematics among the sciences has already been mentioned. Kant's pronouncement, that in every science there is only as much real knowledge\u2014^real cognition\u2014as ffiere is mathe matics, is widely known. Now I have not to deal here with mathematics itself, with its value for the other sciences and in human life, but rather with the mental attitude a man assumes when \" mathematicising if I may use this word; that is, when actively engaged in mathematical thinking. His attitude of soul is then, indeed, quite distinctive. Perhaps we may best characterise it by speaking, fst, of that branch of mathematics which is usually called geometry and, at least in those parts of it known to the majority of people, has to do with space, is the science of space.We are accustomed to speak of three-dimensional space; we picture it so constituted that its three dimensions, as they are called,st^d at right angles to one another. What we have before our mind's eye as space is, in the rst place, quite independent of man and the rest of the world. And because man as an individual being orientates himself in accordance with spatial laws, he pictures space before his eyes, independent of himself. He can certainly say that he is at this or that distance from any selected point; thus he inserts himself into space, as a part of space. And by regarding himself as an earthly being and assigning to himself certain distances from this and that star, he inserts himself into cosmic space. In a word, man regi^ds space as something objective, independent of his own being. It was this that led Kant to call space an a priori intuition {eine Ansehauung a primi), a mode of intuition given to man prior to experience. He cannot ask how he comes to have space; he mustsimply accept it as something given; he must t himself into it whenhe has attained fuU earthly consciousness. But it is not so in reality. We human beings do actually build space out of our own being. More correctly: we build our idea (Vorstellung), our mental perception (Ansehauung), of space fromout of ourselves. Only , we do not do this consciously , because we do it at a time of life when we do not think about our own activities in the way that would be necessary if we were to come to a clear understanding of the nature of space in relation to our own being. Indeed, we should not have our intuition of space (Raumanschauung) if, in our earthly life, we did not rst experience its three dimensions. We do experience them. We experience one of theni when, from out of our inability to walk upright from birth, we raise om- selves into the vertical position. We learn this dimension from the way in which we build it. And what we learn to know is not just any dimension, set at right angles to the other two. We learn toknow this quite definite dimension of space\u2014standing vertically , so to speak, upon the earth's surface\u2014^from the fact that we human beings are not bom upright, but, in accord with the fonnative lawsof our earthly life, must rst raise ourselves into the vertical position. We learn to know the second dimension of space in an equally unconscious manner. You will be well aware that man\u2014to mention what pertains more to his inner than to his outer being\u2014in developing the capacities which serve him in later life, leams toorientate himself from left to right, from right to left. One ne^ only recall that we have ovu: organised speech centre in a certainarea of the brain, the so-called Broca convolutions, while the ofer side of the brain has no such organisation. One also knows to-day \u2014and from accepted science-\u2014that the development of the speech centre on the left side of the human body is connected with the mobility, spontaneous at rst, of the right hand. One knows, too, fat an orientation from right to left develops, that this activity excited on the left by an activity on the right, or vice-versa, is experienced by us within the laws that form us\u2014^just as we ex perience our achievement of the upright position. It is in thisco-ordinated orientation of right with left, or left with right, that we human beings experience the second dimension of space. The third dimension of space is never really experienced by us completely . We rst focus this so-called \" depth-dimension \" as we try to gauge it. We are constantly doing this, though deep downin the unconscious. When we make the lines of vision of our eyes intersect at a point and focus both eyes on this point,^ we expand spa(%, which would otherwise have only two dimensions for us,into the third dimension. And with every estimate of spatial depth we build the third dimension unconsciously out of our own being and the laws that form us. Thus one might say; we place, in a certain way, the three dimensions of space outside us. And what we conceive as space. 67the space we use in geometry\u2014Euclidean geometry, at first\u2014is nothing more than an abstraction from what we learn to know concretely, with our own organism, as the three dimensions linkedto our own subjective being. In this abstraction the quite denite configuration of space is ignored: the definite directions\u2014vertical,horizontal and depth\u2014have equal value. (This is always done when we make abstractions.) And then, when we have constructed by abstracting from the three-dimensional space experienced within'the external space we speak of in geometry , we extend our con sciousness through this external space alone. We now come to the important thing. What we have won from out of ourselves is now applicable to external nature; in the rst place, to inorganic, lifeless forms, though it can also be applied to the spatial and kinetic relations between organic structures. Briefly, this fact largely determines the character of our external world. Having accomplished this transition (this metamorphosis of space)from one domain, which really lives in us, to space commonly so called, we now stand with our spatial concepts and spatial experiences within the outer world and are able to determine our position and motion by spatial measurements. We actually go outof ourselves when we construct space in this way. We lift out of our body what we have rst experienced within ourselves, placing ourselves at a point of view from which we look back upon our selves as Ued with space. In thus objectifying space we are able to study the external movements and relative positions of objects with the help of ideas formed geometrically within space; we feel thereby that we are on rm scientic ground when we enter into objects with what we have formed so earnestly from out of our selves. In these circumstances we cannot doubt that we can live within things with what has come from us in this way. When we judge the distance, or the changing distance, between two bodies inthe outer world according to spatial relations, we believe we are determining something completely objective and independent of ourselves. It does not occur to us that this could be otherwise. Now. however, a fundamental and important problem confronts us here. What we have experienced subjectively in ourselves, transforming it, in the case of space, simply by making from it akind of abstraction, now becomes something permeating\u2014to a Certain extent\u2014^the outer world and appearing to belong Aere. Anyone who considers impartially what confronts us here must say: In his subjective experience of space in its three dimensions and in his subsequent objectifying of this experience, man stands within the external world with his own experiences. Our subjective exiperiences, being experiences of space, are at the same timp: objective. After aU, it is not at all difcult, but trivial and elementary,to see that tWs is so. For when we move ourselves through space. We accomplish something subjective, but at the same tiniia an objective event occurs in the world. T o put it another way, whether 8we see an automaton or a man move forwards, subjectivity does not come into consideration. What occurs when a human being lives spatially is, for the external disposition of the world, quite objective.If we now focus attention on the human being as, in this way, he objecties something of his subjective experience, moving himself in an objective domain by himself traversing space \u2014 for, in objectifying space, he really bears this space within himself also\u2014we are led to say: If man could do with other experiences what he does when \" mathematicising\", he would be able to transfer, to some extent, the mathematical attitude of soul to other experiences. Suppose we could shape other experiences\u2014our mode of perceivingthe qualities of colours and tones, for example\u2014in the same way that we create and shape our experience of space from out of our selves! When we look at a cube of salt we bring the cubical sha.pe with us from our geometry , knowing that its shape is identical with the spatial concept we have formed. If we could create from out of ourselves, let us say , the world of colour , and then confront external coloured objects, we should then, in the same way, project (as it were) into the outer world what we rst build up in ourselves. We should thus place ourselves outside our body and even look back upon ourselves. This has been accomplished in mathematics, although it remains unnoticed. (I have given a geometrical illustra tion; I could give others also.) Neither mathematicians nor philosophers have paid attention to this peculiar relationship that Ihave just put before you. In regard to sense perceptions, however, science has become really confused. In the nineteenth century physiologists joinedhands here even with epistemologists and philosophers, and many people think with them as follows:When we see red, for example, the external event is soffle vibration which spreads itself out until it reaches our organ of vision, and then om: brain. The specic sensation of red is thenreleased. Or the tone C sharp is evoked by an external wave motion in the same way. This confusion has arisen because we can no longer distinguish what lives in us\u2014^within the confines of our body\u2014from what \u00bbs outside. All sense qualities (colours, tones, qualities of warmth) are said to be actually only subjective, while what is external, objective is said to be something quite different. u /4'H now, in the same way in which we build the three aimen- siOns of space from out of ourselves and nd them again m t^gs (and things in them)\u2014if we could, in the same way, draw fromourselves what appears in us as sensation, and then s^ it before us, we should likewise nd in things what we had rst round in our selves. indeed, looking back upon oiirselves we should nd it again\u2014just as we find in the outer world What we have experiencedwithin us as space, and, looking back at ourselves, nd that we are 9& part of this space. As we have the space world around us, so W6 should have around us a world of intermingling colours and tones. We should speak of an objectied world of flowing colours and singing tones, as we speak of the space around us.Man can certainly attain to Ais and learn to know as his own construction the world which otherwise only confronts him as the world of effects (JVirkungen), As we, albeit unconsciously, con struct for ourselves the form of space out of our human constitution and then, having transformed it, nd it again in the world, so we can train ourselves, this time by conscious effort, to draw from out of ourselves the whole gamut of qualities contained in the world, so as to nd them again in things, and then again in looking back upon ourselves. What I am here describing is the ascent to so-called \" imagina tive perception\" {imaginative Anschauung). Every same space-world\u2014unless he be abnormally mathematical or unmathematical. What can live in us in like manner, and in such a way that we experience with it the world as well, can be .acquired by exercises. \" Imaginative perception \"\u2014a technical term that does not denote \"fancy\" or \"imagination\" in the usual sense\u2014^n be added to the ordinary objective perception of objects(in which mathematics is our sure guide), and will open up a new region of the world. * I said yesterday that I would have to expound to you a special method of training and research. I must describe what one has to do in order to attain to such \"imaginative perception\". In this we come to perceive as a whole the qualitative element in the world\u2014just as, in a sense, we come to perceive space (which has,at rst, no reality that engages our higher interests) as a whole. When we are able to confront the world in this way , we are already at the rst stage of supersensible perception. Sense-perception may be compared to that perception of things in which we do not dis tinguish between triangular and rectangular shapes, do not see geometrical structures in things, but simply stare at them and onlytake in their forms externally . But the perception that is developed in \" Imagination\" is as much involved with the inner essence of things as mathematical perception is with mathematical relation ships.If we approach mathematics in the right frame of mind, we coine to see precisely in the mathematician's attitude when \"mathe- maticising \" the pattern for all that one requires for supersensibleperception. For mathematics is simply the rst stage of supersensible perception. The mathematical structures we \"perceive\" in space are supersensible perceptions\u2014though we, accustomed to \"perceive\" them, do not admit this. But one who knows theintrinsic nature of \" mathematicising\" knows that althou^ the 10structure of space has no special interest at rst for our eternal human nature, mathematical thinking has all the characteristics that one can ask of clairvoyance in the anthroposophical sense; freedom from nebulous mysticism and confused occultism, and the sole aim of attaining to the supersensible worlds in an exact, scientic way. Everyone can learn from a study of \"mathematicising\" what clairvoyance is on a higher level. The most astonishing thing is that mathematicians, who of all people ought to know what takes place when a man is \"mathematicising\", do not show a deeper understanding of what must be presented as a higher, qualitative \"mathematicising\" \u2014 if I may use this word \u2014 in claiivoyant research. For \"imaginative\" cognition, the rst stage in this research, is only a perception that penetrates other domaim of existence than those accessible to \"mathematicising\": and it has been gained by exercises. In respect to human perception, however, much is understood differently once one is able to survey, in genuine self-knowledge, the whole inner nature of \"mathematicising\". For example, one arrives at the following: On looking back to the way in which we came to know in early childhood the structure of space\u2014by walking and standing upright, by orientating ourselves to right and left, by learning to gauge the depth-dimension, by connecting all this with the abstractly perceived space of geometry (which the child learns to know from inner experience)\u2014we realise the serious and important consequencesthat follow if we cannot look back to the living ori^n, within our own being, of space\u2014of our conception and perception of space\u2014 but simply accept it in its already transformed shape, independent of ourselves. For example, in recent times we have come to regard this space (with its three dimensions) in such a way that we have gone on to postulate a fourth and hi^er dimensions. These spacesand their geometries are widely known to-day. Anyone who has once learnt to know the living structure of space nds it most interesting to follow such an extension of mathematical operations (applicable to three dimensions) and to arrive at a fourth dimension that cannot be visualised, and so on. These operations are logical (in the mathematical sense) and quite correct. But anyone who knows the genesis of our idea of space, as I have described it, will detect something quite special here. We could take a pendulum, for example, and watch it oscillate. Watching it purely externally, we might expect it to swing further and further out. But it does not. When it has reached a denite point, it swings back again to the opposite side. If we know the relation between the forces involved, we know that the pendulum oscillates and cannot go further because of the relation between the forces. In respect to space, one learns to know (to some extent) such an interplay of forces in the constitution of our soul. Then one views these things differently. From the logical, mathematical standpoint 11one can certainly keep step with those who extend their calculations from three-dimensional to four-dimensional space. But there one must make a halt. One cannot pass on into an indenite fourth dmiension; one must turn back at a certain point, and the fourthdimension bewmes simply the third with a minus sign before it. One returns though the third dimension. The mistake made inthese geometries of more than three dimensions is in going on abstractly from the second to the third, from the third to the fourthdunension, and so on. But what we have here, if I may express itm a comparison, is not simple progression but oscillation Our perception of space must return into itself. By taking the thirddimension negatively , we really annihilate it. The fourth dimensionis the negative third and annihilates the third, making space two-dimensional. And in like manner we can nd a quite real pro gression. even though, logically, mathematically, algebraically, these things can be carried further and further. When we ^nk in accordance with reality, we must turn back at the fourth, fth and sixth dimensions to the space that is simply given us. With thesixth dimension, we have abolished space and reach the point. ^at really confronts us in the culture of our age? This\u2014thatIts Upking has become abstract; that one simply continues along tM Ime of thought that takes us from planimetry , stereometry , etc.. whereas reality leads us back at the fourth dimension into space. But. m timmg back then, we are by no means where we werewhen we found our way into the third dimension by gauging dis- ^ces. We return spiritually enriched. If we can think of thefourth dimension (the negative third) in such a way that we return with it into space, then space becomes lled with spirit, whereasthree-dimensional space is lled with matter . And we nd spacelled with ever loftier spiritual congurations when we pass along the negative third and second and rst dimension and reach the point where we no longer have spatial extension but stand withinthe unextended\u2014the spiritual. ^at I am now describing is not formal mathematics, but thereahty <rf spmtual perception. It is a path in real conformity withthe spmtual and m contrast to the path that has adapted itself so closely to matenal appearances alone. This latter path, even though keepmg close to mathematics\u2014which does not, of course, work m a material way in the soul\u2014^leads nevertheless to an imperceptible world in which one can, at most, only calculate andconsfruet imaginary mathematical spaces. Y on see here that, by penetrating the mathematical domain completefy, we are led to apprehend the innef nature of die spiritual pr^ent everywhere in the world. To understand the mathematicalattitude of soul is to be led directly to the concept of clairvoyant experiencB._ And then we raise ourselves to \"Imagination\" and.in the way I hiave still to describe, come thereby to a comprehensive' survey of the spiritual that can be perceived, not in the ordinaryway . but in the way I have put it here\u2014^that is; by going out ofthe third and into the fourth dimension, and so on, and coming to the domain of no-dimensions\u2014that is, the point This leads us spiritually to the highest if we apprehend it. not as an empty point, but as a \" lled \" point.I was once\u2014it made a great impression on me--regarded with astonishment by an elderly author who had written much on spiritual matters. Seeing me for the rst time, he asked: \"Howdid you rst become aware of this difference between perceiving the sense-world and perceiving the supersensible world?\" Because I always like to express myself about these things with radical honesty, I replied: \"In the moment when I learnt to know the inner meaning of what is called modem or synthetic geometry.\" You see, when one passes from analytic to synthetic geometry\u2014 which enables us, not only to approach forms externally, but to grasp them in their mutual relationships\u2014one starts from forms, not from external co-ordinates. When we work with spatial co ordinates. we do not apprehend forms but only the ends of the co-ordinates; we join up these ends and obtain the curves. In analytical geometry we do not lay hold of the forms, whereas in synthetic geometry we live within them. This induces us to studythe attitude of soul which, developed further, leads us to press on into the supersensible world. I have now described the extent to which Anthroposophy can be sure that it proceeds from \" mathematicising\" as s^ctly as the natural science of to-day\u2014though from another point of view. Natural science applies mathematics as it has been elaborated to date. But anyone who wishes to understand clmrvoyant activ^ must seek it where it is present in its most primitive form: in the construction of mathematical forms. If he can then raise this activity to higher domains, he will be developing something related to elementary, primitive \"mathematicising\" as the more developed branches of mathematics are related to their anxioms. The primary axioms of clairvoyance are living ones. And if we succeed in developing our \"mathematicising\" by exercises, we shall not only see spatial relationships in the world aroimd us, but learn to know spiritual beings revealing themselves to us, even with spiritual inwardness\u2014as we learn to know the \"cubicity \" of a salt crystal. We learn to know spiritual beings when, in this way. we raise to higher domains what we develop by \" mathematicising \". This is what I wished to say, at the outset, about the basis of what must receive recognition as \" clairvoyant research \" in Anthro posophy. We shall go on to see how. with such clairvoyant research,one can ente r different fields of knowledge\u2014^the natural sciences as well as therapy, medicine, history, etc. We shall see that the sciences are not to be attacked; they ate to be enriched by theintroduction of what can be known by supersensible perception. was felt as an inner life-process.

At that time one did not construct foroneself isolated thoughts about the world, for ideas and sense- experiences were one. One saw one's thoughts outside, as one saw red or blue and heard C sharp, G or B natural. Thoughts were in the world outside. Without knowing this, nobody understands the Greek view of the world. But the Greeks perceived only spirit permeated with sense-perceptions, or sense-perceptions permeated by spirit, and no longer differentiations in the process of breathing. * Then once again men sought to attain a higher stage of cognitionin all domains in which they were seeking hi^er knowledge. This stage was also gained through exercises. To-day we have rather vague ideas about the early Middle Ages and their spiritual life.A mediaeval student did not leam so abstractedly as we do to-day. He, too, had to do exercises, and ordinary study was also combined with the doing of exercises. Inward exercises had to be carried out, though not so strenuously as with Yoga breathing; they were more inward, but stiff a set of exercises. From this there remains a kind of deposit, little understood now, in what were called then the Seven Liberal Arts. They had to have been metered by everyone who claimed to have received a higher education. Grammar meant the practical use of language. Rhetoric meant more: the artistic use of language. Dialectic was the use of language as a tool of thought. And when the student had practised these inwardly, as exercises. Arithmetic followed; but this, again, was not our abstract arithmetic, but an arithmetic whichentered into thinjgs and was clearly aware that man shapes all things inwardly. In this way the student learnt Geometry through inward exercises, and this geometry, as something involving the human being, was the pupil's possession\u2014a tool he could use. All this then passed over into what was called Astronomy: the student integrated his being with the cosmos, learnt to know how his head was related to the cosmos, and how his lupgs and heart resulted from the cosmos. It was not an astronomy abstracted from man, but an astronomy in which man had his place. And then, at the seventh stage, the pupil leamt to know how the Divine Being weaves and rules throughout the world. This was called Music: it was not our present music but a higher, living elaboration of what had been elaborated in thought-forms in Astronomy. It was in this way that rnen of a later epoch trained themselves inwardly . The breathing exercises of earlier times had been replaced by a more inward training of the soul. .^d what did one attain? In the course of the history ofciviffsation men came gradually to have thoughts apart from sense- pereeptioM. This was something that had to be acquired. TheGreeks still saw thought in the world, as we see colours and perceive 16tones. We grasp thought as something we produce, not located within things. The fact that men came to feel this in the constitution of their soiffs, that we can feel this to-day\u2014that is the result of the training in Grammar, Rhetoric and so on to Music. Thought was thereby released. Men leamt to move freely in thoughts. In this way was achieved what we take for granted to-day, possessing it Without these exercises\u2014what we find when we go to school, what is offered in the separate sciences (as described yesterday). And precisely as man in different epochs had to advance by means ofexercisra\u2014in ancient times by breathing exercises (Yoga) which gave him the Graeco-Latin conception of the world as somettog he took for granted; in later times by exercises that went from Grammar to Music and gave him the scientic standpoint we have to-day\u2014^so to-day he can again advance. He can best advance by setting out from what is most certain; namely, mathematics, recog nised as certain to-day. My reply to that author was tme, although it so astonished him.It was mainly through synthetic geometry that I became clear about the clairvoyant's procedure. Naturally, not everyone who has studied synthetic geometry is a clairvoyant, but the procedure can be' Clearly presented in this way. TTiough that author was so astonished at not being told the sort of thing that people who\" prophesy \" are wont to relate, it is nevertheless true that Anthro- posophy, setting out from the rm base on which science stands to-day, seeks to extend this base; and from this base, which science itself has laid, to carry further, into supersensible domains, what reliable science brings before us. From here we must proceed more inwardly. And a stiff more inward procedure is the path to clairvoyant research which I had to describe in my books Geheimwissenschaft (\" Occult Science \") and Wie erlangt man Erkenntnisse der Hdheren Welten (\"How to Attain Knowledge of Higher Worlds\"). But precisely such an historical survey as I have ^ven can show you that anyone who stands to-day with full consciousness within Anthroposophy derives this consciousness from standing within the course of human evolution. My historical survey can also show you that I do not speak from personal predilection or subjective partiality when I assert that we need to undertake exercises in order to can7 further the historical movement that has brought humanity to its present standpoint. Anyone who knows the course of history up to the present, and knows how it must continue, stands consciously withinthe whole historical process, and to this consciousness he adds the insight acquired by taking\u2014inwardly, not outwardly\u2014^the spirit of modern science into the constitution of his soul. Thus one may well say: Anthroposophy knows its position in respect to the science of to-day. It knows this in an absolute sense,because it knows the special character of contemporary science afld rejects all that is dilettantish and amateurish. It builds further ongenuine science. On the other hand, Anthroposophy knows thehistorical necessities: knows that man's path must go beyond present achievements\u2014if we do not wish to stand still, unlike all our fore- ruimers. who wanted to advance beyond the stage of civilisation in which they shared. We, too, must go forward. And we must know what steps to take from the present standpoint of the scientic spirit. In the next few days I shall have to depict what this actually involves. The foundations I have laid to-day will then appear, perhaps, in a more understandable form. But I may have been ableto show that Anthroposophy knows from its scientific attitude\u2014 from an attitude as scientific as that of science\u2014^what its aims are in face of the contemporary world, of human evolution as a whole, and of the separate sciences. It will get to work because it knows how it has to work. Perhaps its path will be very long. If, on the other hand, one sees, in the subconscious depths of human souls, the deep longings for the heights that Anthroposophy would climb, one may surmise that it is necessary for the welfare of humanity that the path Anthroposophy has to take should not be too slow. But whetiher the pace be slow or fast may be less important for Anthroposophy than for human progress. In many domains we speak of being caught up in the \" rapid tempo \" of our time. Mayall that mankind is intended to attain by cognition of the super sensible be attained as rapidly as the welfare of mankind requires. Translated by V. C, Bennie.Anthroposophy and the Visual Arts Rudolf Steiner A Lecture^ hitherto untranslated^ given at The Hague on April 9,1922 (following the preceding lecture in this issue)* W H A T I h a v e t o s a y t o - d a y w i l l b e , i n a s e n s e , a n i n t e r l u d e w i t h i nthis course of lectures, for I shall try, from the scientic point of view, to glance at the eld of artistic creation. I hope, however, that to-day's considerations will show that this interlude is really a contribution which will help to elucidate what I said on the pre ceding days and what I shall have to say in the days that follow .When the Anthroposophical Movement had been active for some time, a number of members became convinced that a building should be erected for it. Various circumstances (which I need not mention here) led nally to the choice of the hill at Dornach, m the Jura Hills near Basle, Switzerland. Here the Goetheanum, me Free High School for Anthroposophical Spiritual Science, is being built.t It is not yet completed, but lectures can already be held in it and work can be done. I should now like to speak of the considerations {inneren Verhdltnissen) that prevailed with us when designing this building. If any other spiritual movement of our time had decided to erect its own building, what would have been done? Well, one would have applied to one or more architects, and a building would have been erected in one or other of the traditional styles\u2014^Antique, Renaissance or Gothic. Then, in accordance with what is being done here or there in the various branches of art, craftsmen would have been called in to decorate the building with paintings and plastic forms. Nothing like that could be done in the case of the Domach building\u2014the Free High School for Spiritual Science; it would have contradicted the whole intention and innermost character of the anthroposophical conception of the world. This conception is notan attempt to achieve something one-sidedly theoretical\u2014an ex pression of cosmic laws in a sum of ideas. It intends to be something bom from man as a whole and to serve his whole being. It would be, on the one hand, something that can very well be e x p r e s s e d i n t h o u g h t f o r m s \u2014 a s o n e e x p e c t s o f a n y v i e w o f t h e w o r l dthat is propounded. On the other hand, the anthroposophical world-view would be essentially more comprehensive; it stnves tobe able to speak from the whole compass of man s being. It must therefore be able to speak, not only from the theoretical, saentic spirit, but from an artistic spirit also. It would speak from a * From a shorthand report unrevised by the l^turer.

I have often expressed the task confronting us in Domach with the help of a trivial comparison. If we think of a nut with its kernel inside and the shell around, we cannot think that the grooves andtwists of the shell result from other laws than those that shape \u00b1e kernel. The shell, in clothing the nut, is shaped by the same law^s that shape the kernel. When the building at Dornach, this double cupola, was erected, our aim was to create an architectural, plastic, pictorial shell for what would be done within it as an expression ofthe anthroposophical view of the world. And just as one can speak in the language of thought from the rostrum in Domach about what is perceived in supersensible worlds, so must one be in a position to let the architectural, plastic, pictorial frame for the anthroposophical world-view proceed from the same spirit. But a great danger confronts us here: the danger of having ideas about this or that and then simply giving them external expression in symbolic or insipidly allegorical form. (This is frequently done when. world-views are given external representation: ssonbols or allegories are set up\u2014thoroughly inartistic products which flout the really artistic sense.) It must be clearly understood, above aU, thatthe anthroposophical conception of the world rejects such symbolic or allegorical negations of art {Widerkunst, Unkunst). As a view of the world, it should spring from an inner spiritual life , so rich that it can express itself, not allegorically or symbolically, but in genuinely artistic creations. In Domach there is not a single s)rmbol, not a single allegory to be seen. Everything that has been given artistic expression was bom from artistic perception, came to birth in the moulding of forms, in creating out of the interlay of colours (aus dent Farbig- Mcderischen heraus); it had its origin in a thoroughly artistic act of perception and had nothing to do with what is usually expressedwhen people come and ask: What does this mean? What does that signify? In Domach no single form is intended to mean anything\u2014in tins sense. Every form is intended to be something\u2014in the genuinely artistic sense; it means itself, expresses itself. Those people who come to Domach to-day and maintain that something symbolic or allegorical is to be seen there, are just pro jecting into our building their own prejudgements; they are not expressing what has come to birth with this building. Our aim isthat the same spirit\u2014not the theoretical spirit but the living spirit that speaks from the rostrum or confronts us from the stage\u2014should speak also through the artistically plastic forms, through the architecture, through file paintings. The spirit at work in the \"kernel\"\u2014 the spirit that finds expression through the spoken word\u2014is to shape the \"shell \"also. Now, if the anthroposophical view of the world is somethingnew entering human evolution in the way I have ventured to describe in the two previous lectures, then, naturally, what had been in the world before could not nd expression in our architectural style, our plastic and pictorial forms\u2014i.e. in the visual art of our building. No artistic reminiscences. Antique, Renaissance or Gothic,could be brought in. The anthroposophical world-view had to show itself suflciently productive to evolve its own style of visual art. Of course, if such intentions press on one's heart and soul, one becomes very humble and one's own most severe critic. I certainly know that, if I had to build the Domach building a second time, much that now appears to me imperfect, often indeed wrong, vrould be different. But this is not the essential thing. The esseirtial tmng, at least for to-day's lecture, is the intention (das Wollen) that I have just described. It is of this that I wish to speak. \u00bb When we speak of visual art, in so far as we have to consider ithere\u2014^that is, the plastic art to which the anthroposophical world- view had been directed, as by inner necessity , through the fact that Mends came forward and made the sacrice required in order that the building at Domach could be started\u2014^when we speak of visual art in this sense, we need, before all else, to understand thoroughly the human form. For, after all, everything in visual art points to, and proceeds from, the human form. We must understand the human form in a way that really enables us to create it. I spoke yesterday of one element, the spatial element, in so far as this is an element in our world and, at the same time, proceeds from our human being. I said that the three spatial dimensions, by which we determine all the forms underlying our world, can be derived from the human form. But when one speaks as I spoke yesterday , one does not arrive at the apprehension of space neededfor sensitive, artistic creation if one intends to pursue plastic that plastic art which underlies all visual art\u2014with full conscious ness. Precisely when one has space in its three dimensions so con cretely before one's mind's eye as in yesterday's considerations, onesees that the space arrived at in this way cannot be the space in which one finds oneself when, for example, one forms\u2014also in \"space\", as we say\u2014the human form plastically . One cannotobtain the space in which one nds oneself as a sculptor . One must say to oneself: That is quite a different space. I touch here on a secret pertaining to our human way of looking at the world\u2014a secret that our present-day perception has,one might almost say, quite lost. You will permit me to set out from a way of looking at things that is apparently-but omy apparently\u2014quite abstract, theoretical. But this excursion wU bebrief; it is intended only as an introduction to what will be able to come before our minds' eyes in a much more concrete form. When we intend to apply to objects in this world the space of 20 21wMch I spoke yesterday\u2014we apply it. of course, geometrically, using, in the first place, Euclidean geometry\u2014^we set out, as you all know, from a point and set up three axes at right angles to one another. (As I pointed out yesterday, one ought to take this pointin concrete space to be within the human body .) Any region of space is then related to these axes by determining distances fromthem (or from the three planes that they determine). In this way we obtain a geometrical determination of any object occupying space: or, as in kinematics, one can express motion in space. But there is another space than this: the space into which the sculptor enters. The secret of this space is that one cannot set outfrom one point and relate all else to it. One must set out from the counterpart of this point. And what is its counterpart? Nothingother than an innitely remote sphere to which one might look up as at, let us say, the blue vault of heaven. Imagine that I have, instead of a point, a hollow sphere in whichI nd myself, and that I relate aU that is within it to this hollow sphere, determining everything in relation to it, instead of to a point by means of co-ordinates. So long as I describe it to you only in this way, you could rightly say: Yes, but this determination in relation to a hollow sphere is vague: I can form no mental picture when I try to think it. Well, you would be right: one can form no mental picture. But man is capable of relating himself to the cosmos\u2014as we, yesterday, related ourselves to the human being (the \" anthropos \"). As we looked into the human being and found the three dimensions\u2014as we can determine him in relation to these three dimensions, saying: his body extends linearly in one of the dimensions: in the second is the plane of the extended arms and all that is symmetrically built into the human organism: and in the third dimension is all that extends forwards and backwards, backwards and forwards\u2014so, when we really look at the \" anthropos \" as an organism, we do not nd something extended in an arbitrary wayin three dimensions. We have before us the human organism built in a denite way. * We can also relate ourselves to the cosmos in the same way. What occurs in the soul when we do so? Well: imagine yourself standing in a eld on a clear, starry night, with a free view of the sky. You see regions of the vaulted sky where the stars are closely clustered, almost forming clouds. You see other regions where the stars are more widely spaced and form constellations (as they are called). And so on. If you confront the starry heavens in this merely intellectual way\u2014with your human understanding\u2014youachieve nothing. But if you confront the starry heavens with your whole being, you experience (empnden) them differently. We have now lost the perceptive sense for this, but it can be re acquired. Facing a patch of sky where the stars are close together 22and form almost a cloud, will be a different experience from facmg constellations. One experiences a patch of sky differently when the moon is there and shines. One experiences a night differently when the moon is new and not visible. And so on. .Amd precisely as one can \" feel\" one's way into the human organism in order to have the three dimensions\u2014^where space itself is concrete, something con nected with man\u2014so one can acquire a perception of the cosmos, that is, of one's cosmic environment {Umkreis). One looks into oneself to nd, for example, the three dimensions. But one needs more than that. One can now look out into the wide expanses and focus one's attention on their congurations. Then, as one advances beyond ordinary perception, which sufces for geometry, one acquires the perception needed for these wide expanses: one advances to what I called, yesterday and the day before, \" imagina tive cognition \". I have still to speak about its cultivation. If one were simply to record what one sees out there in cosmic expanses, one would achieve nothing. A mere chart of the starryheavens, such as astronomers make to-day, leads nowhere. If, however, one confronts this cosmos as a whole human being, with full understanding of the cosmos, then, in face of these clusters of stars, pictures form themselves within the soul\u2014^pictures like those one sees on old maps, drawn when \" imaginations \" took shape out of the old, instinctive clairvoyance. One receives an \" imagination \" of the whole cosmos. One receives the counter-image of what I showed you yesterday as the basis, in man, of the three geometrical space-dimensions. What one receives can take an innite variety of shapes. Men have, indeed, no idea to-day of the way in which men once, in ancient times, when an instinctive clairvoyance still per sisted among them, gazed out into the cosmos. People believe to-day that the various drawings, pictures\u2014\" imaginations \"\u2014whichwere made of the zodiacal signs, were the products of phantasy. ITiey are not that. They were sensed {empfunden)-, they were perceived {geschaut) on confronting the cosmos. Human progress required the damping-down of this instinctive, living, imaginative perception, in order that intellectual perception, which sets men free, should come in its place. And from this, again, there must be achieved\u2014if we wish to be whole human beings\u2014a perception of the universe that attains once more to \" Imagination \". If one intends to take, in this way, one's idea of space from the starry heavens, one cannot express it exhaustively by three dimensions. One receives a space which I can only indicate guratively . If I had to indicate the space I spoke of yesterday by three lines at right angles to one another, I should indicate this space by drawing everywhere sets of gures (Kongurationen), as if surface forces iKriifte in Flachen) from all directions of the imiverse were approaching the earth and, from without, were working plastically on the forms upon its surface. 23One comes to such an idea when, advancing beyond what living beings \u2014 above all, human beings \u2014 present to physical eyes, one attains to what I have been calling \"Imagination\". In this the cosmos, not the physical human being, reveals itself in images and brings us a new space. As soon as one gets so far, one perceivesman's second body\u2014^what an older, prescient, instinctive clair voyance called the \"etheric body\". (A better name is \"body of formative forces\" (Bildekrafteleib.) This is a supersensible body, consisting of subtle, etheric substantiality and permeating man's physical body. We can study this physical body if, within the space it occupies, we seek the forces that flow through it. But we cannot study the etheric body (body of formative forces) which flows through the human being if we set out from this space. We can study this only if we think of it as built up out of the whole cosmos: formed plastically from without by \" planes of force \" (Kraftdchen) converging on the earth from all sides and reaching man. * In this way, and in no other, did plastic art arise in times when it was still an expression of what is elemental and primary . Such a work as, for example, the Venus of Milo reveals this to an intuitive eye. It was not created after a study of anatomy, in respectfulreliance on forces which are merely to be understood as proceeding from the space within the physical body. It was created with a knowledge, possessed in ancient times, of the body of formativeforces which permeates the physical body and is formed from put of the cosmos\u2014^formed from out of a space as peripheral as earthly space (physical space) is central. A being that is formed from the periphery of the universe has beauty impressed upon it\u2014\" beauty \" in the original meaning of the word. Beauty is indeed the imprint of the cosmos, made with the help of the etheric body, on a physical, earthly being. If we study a physical, earthly being in accordance with the bare, dry facts, we nd, of course, what it is for ordinary, physical space. But if we let its beauty work on us\u2014if we intend to intensify its beauty by means of plastic art, we must become aware that the beauty impressed upon this being derives from the cosmos. The beauty of this individual being reveals to us how the whole cosmos works within it. In addition, one must, of course, feel how the cosmos nds expression in the human form, for example. If we are able to study the human form with inward, imaginative perception, we are induced to focus our attention, at rst, on theformation of the head apart from the rest. But, looking at this location as a whole, we do not understand it if we try to explain it merely by what is within the head. We understand it only if we conceive it as wrought from out of the cosmos through the mediation of the body of formative forces. If we now pass on to consider man's chest formation, we reachan inward understanding of this\u2014an imderstanding in respect to the human form\u2014only if we can picture to ourselves how man lives on the earth, round which the sttirs of the zodiacal line revolve, (Only apparently revolve, according to present-day astronomy, but that does not concern us here.) Whereas we relate man's head to the pole of the cosmos, we relate his chest formation\u2014which cer tainly functions (yerlduft) in the recurrent equatorial line\u2014to what rups its course, in the most varied ways, in the annual or diurnal circuit of the sun. It is not until we pass on to consider the limb-system of man, especially the lower Ijmb-system, that we feel: This is not related tothe external cosmos, but to earth; it is connected with the earth's force, of gravity. Look with the eye. of a sculptor at the formation of the human foot; it is adapted to the earth's gjavitational force. We take in the whole configuration\u2014^how the thigh bones and shin bones are fitted together by the mediation of the knee\u2014and find it all adapted, dynamically and statically , to the earth, and to the way in which the force of gravity works from the earth's centre outwards, into the universe. We feel this when we study the human form with a sculptor's eye. For the head we need all the forces of the cosmos; we need the whole sphere if we want to understand what is expressed so wonderfully in the formation of the head. If we want to understandwhat nds expression in the formation of the chest, we need what, in a sense, flows round the earth in the equatorial plane; we are led to earth's environment. If we want to understand man's lOwer limb-system, to which his metabolic system is linked, we must turn to the earth's forces. Man is, in this respect, bound to the forces Of the earth. Briefly: we discover a connection between all cosmic space\u2014conceived as living\u2014and the htiman form. * To-day, in many circles (including artistic circles), people will probably laugh at such observations as those I have just made. I can well understand why. But one knows little about the real history of human development if one laughs at such things. For anyone who can enter deeply into the ancient art of sculpture sees from the sculptured forms created then that feelings (Empndungen), developed by the \"imaginative\" view of the starry heavens, have flowed into those forms. In the oldest works of sculpture it is the cosmos that has been made perceptible in the human form. Of course, we must regard as knowledge, not only what is called such in an intellectual sense, but knowledge that is dependent upon the whole range of human soul-forces. One becomes a sculptor\u2014 really a sculptor\u2014^from an elemental urge, not just because one has learnt to lean on old styles and reproduce what is no longer known to-day, but was known in this or that jwriod, when this or that style was dive and sculptors were yet creative. One does not become a 2425sculptor by leaning on traditions\u2014as is usual to-day , even with fully fledged artists; one becomes a sculptor by reaching back, with full consciousness, to the shaping forces which once led men to plasticart. One must re-acquire cosmic feelings; one must be again able to feel the universe and see in man a microcosm \u2014 a world in miniature. One must be able to see the impress of the cosmos stamped upon the human forehead. One must be able to see fromthe nose how it has received the imprint of what has also been stamped upon the whole respiratory system: the imprint of theenvironment\u2014of what revolves roimd the earth in the equatorial and zodiacal lines. Then one senses what one must create (darstellen). One does not work by mere imitation, copying a model, but one re creates by immersing oneself in that force by which Nature herself created and shaped man. One forms as Nature herself forms. But then one's whole mode of feeling, in cognition and artistic expression, must be able to adapt itself to this. When we have the human form before us, we direct our artistic eye at flrst to the head. We do this with the urge to give plastic form to the head. We then try to bring out all the details of this head, treating every surface with loving care: the forehead, the arches above the eyes, the ears and so on. We try to trace, with all possible care, the lines that run down the forehead and over the nose. We proceed, in accordance with our aim, to give this or that shape to the nose. In short, we try to bring out, with loving care, through the different surfaces, what pertains to the human head. Perhaps what I am now about to say may sound heretical to many, but I believe it flows from fundamentally artistic feelings. If, as sculptors, we were striving to form human human legs, we should feel persistent inhibition. One would like to shape the head as lovingly as possible, but not the legs. One would like to hide them\u2014to by-pass them with the help of pieces of clothing, with something or other that conforms sculpturally to what nds ex pression in the head. A human form with correctly chiselled legs\u2014 calves, for example\u2014offends the sculptor's artistic eye. I know that I am saying something heretical, but I also know that it is thereby the more fundamentally artistic. Correctly chiselled legs! \u2014 one does not want them. Why not? Well, simply because there is another anatomy for the sculptor; his knowledge of the human form is different from the anatomist's. For the sculptor\u2014strange as it may sound\u2014there are no bones and muscles. For him there is the human form, built out of the cosmos with the help of the body of formative forces. And in the human form there are forhim forces, effects of forces, lines of force and force-congurations. As a sculptor I cannot possibly think of the cranium when I form the human head; I form the head from without inwards, as the cosmos has moulded it. And I form the corresponding bulges on the head in accordance with the forces that press upon the formfrom within outwards and oppose the forces working in from the cosmos. When, as a sculptor, I form the arms, I do not think of the bones but of the forces that are active when, for example, I bend my arm. I have then lines of force, developing forces, not what takes shape as muscle or bone. And the thickness of the arm depends on what is present there as life-activity, not on the muscular tissue. Because, however , one has above all the urge to make the human form with its beauty conform to the cosmos, but can do so only withthe head\u2014the lower limbs being adapted to the earth one leaves the lower limbs out. When one renders a human being m art, onewould like to lift him from the earth. One would make a he^ earth-being of him, if one were to give too denite shape to ms lower limbs. Again, looking at the head alone, we see that only \"PP\u00ae'p a r t , t h e w o n d e r f u l l y v a u l t e d s k u l l , i s a c o p y o f t h e w h r f e c o s .

Hen , when I come to do the eyes of a sculptured gure of a huma being, I must confine myself\u2014since one cannot, as you Know,represent a man's gaze, whether deep or sui^rcial, by any shaof colour\u2014to representing large or small, slit or oval, or more o less less straight eyes. But how one represents the way tne eye passes over into the form of the nose, or how the ^this\u2014how one suggests that man sees by bringing his whoi n t o h i s s e e i n g \u2014 a l l t h a t i s d i f f e r e n t w h e n t h e e y e s a r e s h t . o v a ls t r a i g h t .

I should have to call an expression of the manas a man of courage\u2014as a man who sets his inner self, in so far as It IS courageous, in opposition to the external cosmos; and the mouth as an expression of what he is in his inner being. (Of course the^mouA, as a part of the head-formation, is also shaped fromwithout, but what a man is in his inner being works from within against the conguration from without.) Only some sketchy hints that require to be thought out couldw given here. But you will have seen from these brief indications mat the sculptor requires more than a knowledge of man gainedfrom imitating a human model; he must actually be able to experience inwardly the forces that work through the cosmos when they build the human form. The sculptor must be able to graspwhat takes place when a human being is plastically formed fromme fertihsed o\\mm in the.mother's body\u2014not merely by forces in the moth^ s body , but by cosmic forces working through the mother. He must be able to create in such a way that, at the same time, he can understand what the individual human being revealsof himself, more and more, as the sculptor approaches the lower limbs. He must, above all, be able to understand how man's wonderful outer covering\u2014the form of his skin\u2014results from two sets of forces: the peripheral forces working inwards, from all directions, out of tiie cosmos, and the centrifugal forces working outwards and opposing the former. Man in his external form must be, for the sculptor, a result of cosmic forces and inner forces. One must have such a feeling towards all details. In art one needs a feehng for one's material and should knowf o r w h a t t h i s o r t h a t m a t e r i a l i s s u i t e d ; o t h e r w i s e , o n e i s n o t w o r k i n g Kulpturally but only illustrating an idea, working noveUiStically .H one is forming the human gure in wood, let us say, one will know when at work on t he head t hat one must f eel t he f orm pressing from without inwards. That is the secret of creating the human forin. 'WTien I form the forehead, I am constrained to feel that Iam pressing it in from without, while forces from within oppose me.I must only press, more lightly or more strongly , as required in ofder to restrain the forces working from within. I must press, hihriy or strongly, as the cosmic forces (which indicate how thehead must be formed) permit But when I come to the rest of the human body, I can make no if I form and build from without inwards. I cannot but rem that I am inside. Already when I come to form the chest, Imust place myself inside the man and work plastically from within outwards. This is very interesting. When one is at work on the head, one comes through the inner necessity of artistic creation to work from without inwards\u2014to think of oneself on the extreme periphery and working inwards; when one forms the chest, one must place oneself inside and bring the form out. Lower down one feels: here I must only give indica tions; here we pass over into the indenite. Artistic creation of our time is very often inclined^ to regard the sort of things I have been saying here as an inartistic spinning of fancies. But it is only a matter of being able to experience artistic ally in one's soul what I have just hinted at: of being able actuallyto stand, as an artist, within the whole creative cosmos. Theii one is led, from all sides, to avoid imitating the human physical form when one approaches plastic art. For the human physical fom isitself only an imitation of the \"body of formative forces . one will feel the necessity felt, above aU, by the Greeks. would never have produced the forms of their noses and foreheads by mere imitation; an instinct for such things as I have just described was fundamental with them. One will be able to return to a really fundamental artistic feeling only if, in this way , one can place oneself with all the inner feeling of one's soul\u2014withinner \"total cognition\" (if I may use this expression)\u2014witto nature's creative forces. Then one does not set to work on the external, physical body , which is itself only an imitation of the etheric body , but on the etheric body itself. One forms this ethenc body and then only lls it out (in a sense) with matter .What I have just described is, at the same time, a way out of me theoretical view of the world and into a living perception of wlmt can no longer be viewed theoretically. One caxmot conrtruct the sculptor's space by anal5ftieal geometry , as one constructs Euclidean space. One can, however , perceive (erschauen), by \" imagination ,t h i s s p a c e \u2014 p r e g n a n t w i t h f o r m s , e v e r y w h e r e a b l e t o p r o d u c e s h a p e s out of itself, and from such perception {Schauen) one can create forms in plastic art, architectural or sculptural. At this point I should like to make a remark which seems important to me, so that something which could easily be mis understood will be less misunderstood. If someone has a magnetic needle and one end points to the north, the other to the (magnetic) south,'it will not occur to him \u2014if he does not want to talk as a dilettante\u2014to explain the direction of the needle by inner forcK of the needle: that is, by considering only what is comprised witMn the steel. That would be nonsense. He includes the whole earth in his explanation of the needle's direction. He goes outside the magnetic needle. Embryology makes to-day the dilettantish mis take; it looks at the human ovum only as it develops in the mother sbody: All the forces that form the human embryo are supposed tobe therein. In reality , the whole cosmos works through the mother's body upon the conguration of the embryo. The plastic forces ofthe whole cosmos are there, as are the forces of the earth in directing the magnetic needle. Just as I must go beyond the needle when studying its behaviour, so, when considering the embryo, I must look beyond the maternal body and take account of the whole cosmos. And I must immerse myself in the whole cosmos if I want to apprehend what guides my hand, what guides my arm, when I strive, as a sculptor, to form the human gure.Y ou see: the anthroposophical world-view leads directly from merely theoretical to artistic considerations. For it is not possibleto study the etheric body in a purely theoretical way. Of course one must have the scientic spirit, in the sense in which I character ised it yesterday , but one must press on to a study of the \" body of formative forces\" by transforming into \" imaginations\" what weaves in mere thoughts; that is, by grasping the external world, not only by means of thoughts or natural laws formulated in thoughts, but by \"imaginations\". What we have so grasped,however, can be expressed in \" imaginations \" again. And if we become productive, it passes over into artistic creation. It is strange to survey the kingdoms of nature with the con sciousness that such a body of formative forces exists. The mineral kingdom has no such body; we nd it rst in the plant kingdom.Animals have a body of formative forces; man also. But the plant's is very different from the animal's or man's. We are confronted here by a peculiar fact: think of yourself as equipped with the sensitive powers of an artistic sculptor and expected to give plastic shape to plant forms. It is repugnant to you. (I tried it recently,at least in relief.) One cannot give a form to plants; one can only indicate their movements in some vague way . One cannot shape plants plastically. Just imagine a rose, or any other plant with a long stalk, plastically formed: impossible! Why? Because, whenone thinks of the plastic shape of a plant, one thinks instinctively of its body of formative forces; and this is within the plant, as is its physical body, but directly expressed. Nature sets the plant beforeus as a work of plastic art. One cannot alter it. Any attempt to mould a plant would be bungling botchwork in face of what Nature herself produces in the physical and formative-force bodies of a plant. One must simply let the plant be as it is\u2014or contemplate it with a sculptor's mind, as Goethe did in his morphology of plants.An animal can be given plastic shape. The artistic creation of animal forms is, indeed, somewhat different from artistic creation when we are confronting a human being. One needs only to imderstand that if an animal is, let us say, a beast of prey, it must be apprehended as a \"creature of the respiratory process.\" One must see it as a breathing being and, to a certain extent, mould all the rest around the respiratory process. If one intends to give 30plastic shape to a camel or a cow, one must start from the digestive process and adapt the whole animal to this. In short, one must perceive inwardly, with an artistic eye, what is the main thing. If one differentiates further what I am now indicating in inore general terms, one will be able to give plastic shape to the various animal forms. Why? Well, a plant has an etheric body, created for it from out of the cosmos. It is nished. I cannot re-shape it. The plant is a plastic work of art in the world of nature. To form plants of marble or wood contradicts the whole sense of the factual world. It would be more possible in wood, for wood is nearer to the plant's nature; but it would be inartistic. But an animal sets its own nature against what is being formed from without, out of the cosmos. With an animal, the etheric body is no longer formed merely from the cosmos; it is also formed from within. And in the case of a human being? Well, I have just said that his etheric body is formed from the cosmos only so far as the cranium is involved. I have said that the respiratory organisation, working in a rened state through eyes and nose, opposes the cosmic action, while the whole metabolic organisation, through the forma tion of the mouth, offers opposition also. What comes from the human being is active there and opposes the cosmos. Man's outer surface is the result of these two actions: the human and the cosmic. The etheric body is so formed that it unfolds from within. And by artistic penetration to \"within\", we become able to create forms freely. We can investigate how an animal forms its etheric body for itself from its being {Wesenheit), and how a courageous or cowardly, a suffering or rejoicing human being tunes his ethenc body to his soul life; and we can enter into all that and give form to such an etheric body. If we do this, and have the right sculptural understanding, we shall be able to form the human gure in many different ways. Thus we see that, when we come to study the etheric body\u2014the \"imaginative body\" \u2014we can let ordinary scientific study bethoroughly scientic, while we, however , pass on to what becomes,of itself art. Someone may interpose: Indeed, art is not saence. But I said, the day before yesterday: If nature the world, the cosmos are themselves artistic, confronting us wiA what can onlybe grasped artistically , we may go on asserting that it is illogicalto become artistic if we would understand things, but things simply do not yield to a mode of cognition that does not pass over into art. The world can be understood only in a way which is not connedto what can be apprehended by thoughts alone, but leads to the universal apprehension of the world and nds the wholly organic, natural transition from observation to artistic perception, and to artistic creation too. Then the same spirit that speaks throu^ the words when one gives expression, in a more theoretical way\u2014^in the 31 GB~3form of ideas\u2014to what one perceives (erschaut) in the world, will speak from our plastic art. Art and science then derive from the same spirit; we have in them only two sides of one and the same revelation. We can say: In science, we look at things in such a way that we express in thoughts what we have perceived; in art, we express it in artistic forms. * From this inner, spiritual conviction was born, for example,what has found expression in the architecture, and in the painting too, in the building at Dornach. I could say much about painting also, for it belongs, in a sense, to the plastic arts. But that would bring us to what pertains more to man's soul life and nds direct expression, not in the etheric body alone, but in the soul tingeing the etheric body. Here, too, you would see that the anthro- posophical apprehension of the world leads to the fundamentallyartistic level\u2014^the level of artistic \" creativity \"\u2014whereas we to-day, in the religious as well as in the artistic sphere\u2014though this is mostly unknown to artists themselves\u2014live only on what is tradi tional, on old styles and motives. We believe we are productive to-day, but we are not. We must nd the way back into creative nature, if our work is to be artistically spontaneous, original creation. And this conviction has led, of itself, to Eurhythmy: the branch of art that has grown upon the soil of Anthroposophy. What the human being does in speech and song, through a denite group of organs, as a revelation of his being, can be extended to his whole being, if one really understands it. In this respect all the ancient religious documents (Urkunden) speak from old, instinctive, clair voyant insights. And it is signicant that it is said in the Biblethat Jahwe breathed into man the living breath. This indicates that man is, in a certain respect, a being of respiration. I indicated yesterday that, in olden times of human evolution, the view predominated that man is a \" breather \", a being of respiration. What nian, as a being of respiration, becomes in \" congurated breathing \" \u2014^i.e. in speech and in song\u2014can be given back to the whole man and his physical form. TTie movements of his vocal cords, his tongue and other organs when he speaks or sings, can be extendedover his whole being\u2014^for every single organ and system of organs is, in a certain sense, an expression of his whole being. TTien something like Eurhythmy can arise. We need only remind ourselves of the inner character of Goethe's doctrine of metamorphosis, which is not yet sufciently appreciated. Goethe sees, correctly, the whole plant in the single leaf. \"Hie whole plant is contained in the leaf in a primitive form; and the whole plant is only a more complicated leaf. In every single organ hesees a whole organic being metamorphosed in some way or other, and the whole organic being is a metamorphosis of its individual 32members (Glieder). The whole human being is a more complicated metamorphosis of one single organic system: the glottal systein. If one understands how the whole human being is a metamorphosis of the glottal system, one is able to develop from the whole man a visible speech and visible song by movements of his limbs and by groups of performers in motion. And this development can be as genuine, and can proceed with as much inner, natural necessity as the development of song and speech from one specialised organ. One is within the creative forces of nature; one immerses oneself in the way in which our forces act in speaking or singing. When one has grasped these forces, one can transfer them to the foms of motion of the whole human being, as one transfers, in plastic art. the forces of the cosmos to the human form at rest. And as one gives expression to what lives within a man\u2014emerging from hissoul in poetry or song, or in some other art\u2014as one expresses what can be expressed through speech, song or the art of recitation, so, too, can one express through the whole human being, in visible speech and song, what lives within him.I should like to put it in this way: When we, as sculptors, give plastic shape to the human form, creating the microcosm out ofthe whole macrocosm, we create one pole; when we now immerse ourselves in the man's inner life, following its inner mobility, enter ing into his thinking, feeling and willing\u2014^into aU that can find expression through speech and song\u2014we can create \"sculpture m motion\" (bewegte Plastik). One could say: when one creates awork of plastic art, it is as if the whole wide universe were brpu^t together in a wonderful synthesis. And what is concentrated in the deepest part of the human being, as at a point within his soul,strives, in the formed movements put out by the eurhythmst, to flow out into cosmic spaces. In the art of Eurhythmy in sculp ture in motion \"\u2014^the other pole responds from the human side, int h e s c u l p t o r ' s p l a s t i c a r t w e s e e t h e c o s m i c s p a c e s t u r n t ^ a r d s t n e earth and flow together in the human form at rest. Thpn, con centrating on man's inner life, immersing ourselves in it spintuaiiy ,we perceive (schauen) what, to some extent, streams out trom man to all points of the periphery of the universe and .\u00ae cosmic forces that flow in upon him from all sides and build n s f o r m ; w e d e s i g n E u r h y t h m y a c c o r d i n g l y. . I should like to add: the universe sets us a \u00ae beautiful human form is the answer . Man's umer life also ^ets usa g r e a t t a s k ; w e e x p l o r e i n n i t e d e p t h s w h e n ^ i t h o u r s o i fl s l o - m g gaze, we concentrate on man's inner life.too, strives out into all the wide expanses and, in dartmg. (wciHatmg movements, would give rhythmic expression to what has beencompressed\" to a point\u2014as plastic art stnves to have all ffiesecrets of the cosmos compressed in the human form (which is, forthe cosmos, a point). The human form in plastic art is the answert o t he great quest ion put t o us by t he universe. And when man's 33art of movement becomes cosmic and creates something of a cosmic nature in its own movements\u2014as in the case of Eurhythmy\u2014then a kind of universe is born from man, guratively at least. We have before us two poles of visual art: in the very ancient plastic art and in the newly created art of Eurhythmy . But one must enter into the spirit of what is artistic, as we did above, if one would really understand the right of Eurhythmy to be considered an art. One must return to the way in which plastic art once took Its place in human life. One can easily picture to oneself shepherds in a eld who, in the small hours of the night, turn their sleepy , but waking, eyes to the starry heavens and receive unconsciously intotheir souls the cosmic pictures formed by the congured \" imagina tions \" of the stars. What was revealed to the hearts of primitive men in this way was transmitted to sons and grandsons; what had been inherited grew in their souls and became plastic abilities in the grandsons. The grandfather felt the cosmos in its beauty, the grandson formed beautiful plastic art with the forces which his soulhad received from the cosmos. Anthroposophy must look into, and not only theorise about, the secrets of the human soul. It must experience the tragic situation of the human soul, all its exultations and all that lies between. And Anthroposophy must be able to see more than what evokes the tragic mood, what is now exultant and all that lies between. As one saw the stars clearly in older \" imagination and was able to receive into one's soul the formative forces from the stars, so one must take out of the human soul what one perceives there, and be able to communicate it through outer movements; then Eurhythmy begins.the breath of freedom and of individuality the breath of sacrice.But art, especially plastic art, stands between, with all that is rooted i n t h e r e a l m o f b e a u t y . ^ . x Through science man becomes a free, individual being. In religious observance he offers up his own well-being, on the onehand maintaining his freedom, but already , on the other , ^ticipating sacricial service. In art he nds he can maintain hmiself by sacricing, in a certain sense, what the world has made of ^m; heshapes himself as the world has shaped him, but he creates as afree being this form from out of himself. In art, too, there is something that redeems and sets free. In art we , side, individuals; on the other, we offer cril-ntirwe may say: In truth, art sets us free, if we take hold of ^t s - ally, with ideas\u2014including those of spiritual science..a l s o s a y : I n b e a u t y w e n d a g a i n o u r c o n n e c t i o n w i t h t h e w o r l dM a n c a n n o t e x i s t w i t h o u t l i v i n g f r e e l y m h i m s e l f , i n d i v i d u a l i t ynding his connection with the world.

C. Bennie. What I have said to-day is only intended to be once more a cursory indication of the natural transition from Anthroposophy asa body of ideas to Anthroposophy as immediate, unallegorical, un- symbolical plastic art, creating in forms\u2014as is our aim. Anyone who sees this clearly will discover the remarkable relation of art to science and religion. Science will appear on one level, religion on another, and art between them. It is to science, after all, that man owes all his freedom\u2014he would never have been able to attain to complete inner freedom without science\u2014and what man has gainedas an individual \u2014 what his being, regarded impartially, has gained by his becoming scientific \u2014 will be apparent. With his thoughts he has freed himself from the cosmos; he stands alone andis thereby a human individuality. As he lives with natural laws,so does he take them into his thoughts. He becomes independent in face of nature. In religion he is drawn to devotion; he seeks to nd his way back to the essential foundations of nature. He would be again a part of nature, would sacrice his freedom on the altar of the universe, would devote himself to the Deity\u2014would add toAnthroposophy and Religion Alfred Heidenreich ^\"dolf Steiner came out fully on to the public scene in\" the last culminating phase of his life, after the end of the rst war, e often referred to his work as anthroposophisch orientierte (^isteswissenschaft. This was the term which had ripened overme years as the most adequate name for his teaching. It was fVissenschaft\u2014^science\u2014^in the exact meaning of the word. Theobservation of fact, the penetrating thought, the searching question,the weighing up of possibilities, the freedom from preconceived ideas, all the qualities which make the scientic attitude, were present in his method. But it was a science which refused to be conned to the material eld, although it should never be over looked that Steiner was a scientist in the material eld, too. His reading and factual knowledge of material science, includingtheoretical and applied physics, and theoretical and applied chemistry , were phenomenal. But his new and specic sphere ofresearch was the Unseen. For this purpose the spirit part of man had to be developed according to those scientic methods which he has explained in his fundamental books. Once this was done, he could say that \"Anthroposophy is a Imowledge of all that which the spirit organism of man can observein the spirit world in the same way in which the sensory organism of man observes the physical world.\" And he applied the full conscientious scientic discipline of mind to his exploration of the Invisible. Hence he founded a true Gm/gjwissenschaft, a science of the spirit. And it was \" anthroposophically orientated.\" It opened a new epoch in the history of occultism. Until Steiner, all occultism had been t/zeosophically orientated, derived from ancient wisdom, handed down and taught in mystic schools and occult societies. Its original sources lay in an ancient form of hxunan consciousness. It was based on visions received as the result of subtle changes in the physiological conditions of the human organism. Steiner broke with all this. His starting point was the dormant faculties of higher knowledge in a human consciousness which has undergone a scientic training. These faculties could be trainedto become conscious apart from their physical organs\u2014leibfrei. Md the human being, himself the \" anthropos \", was the key to the riddles of the universe. Man the Unknown was to become Manthe Known. In this way his science of the spirit was \"anthropo- sophieaUy orientated.\"The Spirit-World which Steiner's method opened up for rst hand scientic observation and research, revealed itself as a world of tremendous energies sustaining life, sensation, thought; a worldof beings differing m their degrees of consciousness; a world of dynamic events reacting on the physical universe. Though approached in this epoch-making new manner , it was of course the same world with which the great religious systems of himanity in their several different ways had endeavomed to maintain contact through teaching, through prayer and ritual. It was the worldcovered by the whole majestic doctrinal structme concerning God, heaven, life after death, the last judgment, which I^man (^ttolic Christianity regards as nal and entrusted to the Roman Church for ever, and which Protestant Christianity regards as unknowable to man's reason and an object of faith only. Now this world hadbecome an accessible eld of scientic research by ^e^^ened spiritual power of a human consciousness, and a method nad been developed by which the practice of this research could be taught. This situation must raise the most far-reaching questions una^- able. It touches on the innermost nerve of man's spurituai lite. In actual fact, however, the full implications of this revolution have only gradually become apparent. The relevant questions have still largely to be formulated and sorted out with patience, withreverence and with an open mind. This momentous process is not really served by quick posers such as: Is Anthroposophy a new religion? Has Anthroposophy religion? Is Anthroposophy compatible with religion? Such questions, natiural as they may be, oversimplify the issue.Rudolf Steiner himself treated the problem as one jwhich emerges and grows with the expanding life of the impulse which he injected into human evolution. When interviewed on the subject,he said many different things to different people at ^erent times.But it is possible to trace one fundamental line of thoughtd i r e c t i o n i n t h i s m a t t e r w h i c h g o e s t h r o u g h ^ h o l e o ^ teaching. The principle is, as far as I can see,rst time precisely in a short essay , written earlyw h i c h h a s b e e n p u b l i s h e d i n t h e r s t o f t h e t t e e e l i t t l e v o l u m entitled From the Contents of the Esoteric School.\"Theosophy is not a religion\", Ruddf Steiner m tksearly essay still using the earlier term Theosophy , butA n t h r o p o s o p h y . \" b u t a m e a n s f o r t h e u n d e r s t a n d i n g o f & e r e h - gions.

I t i s t h u s w i t h T h e o s o p h y ^ The statement is clear. But it reveals also the core of theproblem. Theosophy is not a religion\", the statement says it continues it shows that the subject-matter<M Theosophy is the same as that of religion, or at least as that ofthe rehgious documents. And as Theosophy or Anthroposophy is the fresh discovery compared with the old book, is it not natural that It should be taken as superseding \"the old book\", however much one may afrm that it is itself not a religion ? Some ten years later , on the threshold of reaching the general public, Rudolf Steiner gave a public lecture at Liestal in Switzerland (1 1.1.16) on \"The T ask of Spiritual Science and its Building at Dornach.\" This lecture, available as a separate publication, is among the best introductory material for inquirers. Apart from a plain fundamental exposition of the task of Anthroposophy , RudolfSteiner deals with a number of popular questions and misconcep tions. One of these questions is \" how Anthroposophy is related to the religious life of man.\" Rudolf Steiner says: \"Religions are facts in the historic life of the human race. Spiritual Science can indeed go so far as to study the spiritual phenomena which in the course of evolution have appeared as religion. But Spiritual Science can never wish to create a religion, just as little as Natural Science can harbour the illusion of being able to create anything in nature Neither need the intensity with which anyone practises his religion and his ritual services be in any way impaired by that which he nds in Spiritual Science.\" In this representative public statement, Rudolf Steiner draws the line even more denitely. Religion is recognised as one of the great facts of life. It is acknowledged as resting on its own groimd, like the natural phenomena of creation. Anthroposophy can study them as Science does, but cannot create them. There, for the purposes of this public statement, the matter ends. But the student of Steiner's work in general has still an unresolved question in his mind. Is not the very method of anthro- posophical research, even irrespective of its object, bound to havea religious flavour? And often its object is religion itself. Steiner's Anthroposophy is by no means simply a study of com parative religion, or a higher criticism of sacred texts. It speaks,in a sense, the same language as religion. Its approach to spiritual realities, and of course to spiritual beings, is of necessity devo tional rather than analytical, or at any rate it grows more devotional the further it progresses. No reader of Steiner's fundamental text book on \"How to Attain Knowledge of Higher Worlds\" can overlook the stress which is laid on devotion and reverence. It is an indispensable quality of mind for the explorer into the Invisible. There is, indeed, a special lecture on \"The Mission of Religious Devotion,\" which Steiner gave in 1909 in Berlin. Where, then, in spite of seemingly categorical statements, is the real difference ? Let us look at one more quotation from Steiner's writings. Wechoose a passage from his Letters to Members of the year 1924, so that we may have a representative utterance from the beginning, the middle, and the end of his anthroposophical career. In the rst of these \"Letters\" (20.1.1924), Rudolf Steiner gives the following moving description of Anthroposophy:\" If Anthroposophy to begin with has its roots in the insight into the Spirit World already gained, its branches, leaves, flowers and fruits grow into all the elds of human life and action. With the thoughts which reveal the beings and laws of the spirit world, it extends its call into the depth of the creative human soul: the artistic powers are called forth. Art receives a imiversal stimulus.\" It makes the warmth which radiates from the uplifted gaze to the spirit flow into hearts: the religious sense awakens in true devotion to the Divine in the world. Religion receives a profound d e e p e n i n g . . ,\" It opens its fountains and the charitable human will draw from them. It makes alive the love between human bemgs and thereby creates impulses for moral action and true social practice.\" It fructies the observation of nature through the germmatmg power of spiritual vision and thereby turns mere knowledge of nature into wisdom of nature.\" Many students of Anthroposophy will enthusiastically conrmfrom their own experience what Rudolf Steiner says. Not l^st those who through Anthroposophy have had their religious life quickened, and the many who only through Anthroposophy havefound their way again to what had been a lost country . :^t on the other hand it cannot be denied that a considerable number of men and women who were estranged from religion did not feel inspired by Anthroposophy to embrace religion, agam or for therst time, but took Anthroposophy itself, bona de, as a substiwte. They accepted and practised it as a form of spiritual life wmcn replaced religion for them. I think I am right in pymg that todayat least half the members of the Anthroposophical Society treat Anthroposophy in this manner. It is a very subtle problem ana it is not at all easy to express a judgment on the rights or wrongs of the matter. * At one time, however . Rudolf Steiner himself sfems to have felt somewhat uneasy about this development. In a \u00ae Yi n B e r l i n i n t h e e a r l y m o n t h s o f 1 9 1 7 a n d p u b l i s h e d u n d e r t h e t i t l eof \" Cosmic and Human Metamorphosis \", ofr e g a r d e d a s o n e o f t h e m o s t p r o f o u n d l e c t o e s t ^ e M ^ t ^ y o fthe Trinity. In the course of this lecture (20.^1917), he went outo f h i s w a y t o m a k e a n u n u s u a l i n t e r p o l a t i o n { E m s c h a l t u n g ) . a s h e \" ^ ^ \" \" i f t h i s D o i n t \" h e s a i d . \" I b e l i e v e I o u g h t t o m a k e a n i n t e r p o l a t i o n w h i c h i s i m p o r t a n t a n d w h i c h s h o u l d b e r e a l t y w e l l u n d e rs t o o d , p a r t i c u l a r l y b y t h e f r i e n d s o f o u r S p i r i t u a l S c i e n c e . T h e 38matter should not be represented as if spiritual-scientic endeavoufs were intended as a substitute for the life and practice of religion. Spiritual Science can in the highest degree, and particularly con cerning the Mystery of Christ, be a support, a foundation for thelife and practice of religion. But Spiritual Science should not be made' a religion; but one ought to be clear that religion in its active life and living practice within the human community kindles the spirit-consciousness of the soul.\" And Steiner proceeds further to say that the spirit-consciousness which is attained in a living religious practice can lead to the desire for more detailed spiritual knowledge, such as is made available in anthroposophical teaching,which in return can become a further support for the religious life. In other words, Steiner outlines here the idea of an interaction and mutual support between Anthroposophy and religion. He implies a basic and necessary differentiation of function between the two. which should, however, be co-ordinated for the benet of the spiritual seeker.This \"interpolation\" had an important historic consequence. It caused a number of young Anthroposophists to approach Rudolf Steiner with the question whether he regarded an independent movement for the renewal of religion as desirable or necessary. This approach took the form of a short, carefully worded memorandumin which this interpolation was quoted as the prime cause for the enquiry . Rudolf Steiner responded at once with a degree of readyco-operation which astonished the enquirers. The result was thefoundation of the Movement for Religious Renewal known as \"The Christian Community\", the name given to it by Rudolf S t e i n e r h i m s e l f . . . . \u00ab This foundation revealed Rudolf Steiner himself as an event inthe history of religion. For through his instrumentality nothing less occurred than a re-statement or re-creation of the sacramental mysteries of Christianity , together with a new priestly succession.Rudolf Steiner himself did not assume the priestly quality, but as Initiate conferred it on Friedrich Rittelmeyer, the rst head of the Christian Community , in whom the new succession has its ning. One has to go far back in history in order to nd standardsof comparison. The gure of Moses comes to mind, who instituteda new priesthood through his brother Aaron without ^cepting priestly ofce himself. Referring to the foundations of the Chnstian Community, Rudolf Steiner wrote, \"I cannot but re^on this ex perience as one of the solemn festivals of my life . (Goetheanum, II, 32). In many ways we are still too close to these events to appreciate fully their historic consequence and signicance. But it is clearthat with the birth of \"The Christian Community , religion, and in particular Christian religion, entered altogether into a funda mentally new epoch, and with it a new factor entered the plation-ship of Anthroposophy to religion. For the rst time in 2,000years it has become possible to unite complete freedom of thoughtand belief with the full cosmic reality of sacramentalism. For it is a fundamental principle of the Christian Community that both priests and members have complete freedom in their personal spiritual life and research. The \"Creed\" which Rudolf Steinergave and which, I think, will one day be universally recognised asone of the most inspired new documents of Christianity , does not contain the formula \"I believe\". It is a sequence of twelve afrmative sentences covering the mysteries of Christianity m such a manner that the contemplation of this document, the meditative use of it, will lead the seeker in complete freedom to a growing insight into these mysteries. On the other hand, the Seven Sacraments grouped around the \"Act of Consecration of Man\", the renewed Euchar^t, like the planets around the sun, have become in their rebirth throu^R u d o l f S t e i n e r t h e p a t t e r n a n d a r c h e t y p e o f c r e a t i v e h u m ^ a c m a f yin the spirit of Christ. Their spiritual power is directed towards the transformation of the earth and of nature as much as towards the healing of human souls. For the\"\u00aerst time in Christian history we have to-day a true Infant Baptism, and not only an adaptation for children ot ab a p t i s m a l R i t u a l f o r A d u l t s .

Apart from his general comprehensive presentation of the nature of man and of the interplay of the living body with soul and spirit which in itself opens up a truly modern approach to \" pastoral\" problems, Rudolf Steiner laid the foundation for co-operation between priest and doctor through a special course on Pastoral Medicine, in the last weeks of his public life. It can be imagined what it means that, for the rst time, the facts of reincarnation and karma can be brought to bear by Christian ministers on the problems of sin, guilt and forgiveness, and the burdens which individual souls may have to bear can be understood and eased in the light of that truth. Compassionate service, friendliness, neighbourliness, in short all the social attitudes which one expects to nd in a religious Com munity can be lifted in the light of Steiner's teaching from the levelof moral obligation to the level of imaginative love. In this new quality of community life there lies a valuable safeguard against the dangers of self-centredness and spiritual egotism which so easily affect the solitary seeker. While the new sacramental organism, with its new priestly succession, was given by the Initiate to the Christian Community alone, the other gifts of religious renewal can be freely shared by anyone else. They can be shared by other Churches, they can be shared by Anthroposophists. However, Rudolf Steiner took pains to explain that it should not be regarded simply as a matter of course that members of the Anthroposophical Society become members of the Christian Community, or vice-versa. It should be, in each case, a clearly considered decision. People must be free to join the Anthroposophical Society without changing their Church, if they so wish; and people must be free to join the Christian Community without being committed to go to anthro posophical lectures or meetings, if they so wish.In itself, this distinction is so natural and reasonable that it should not present any practical difculty. It must be said, how ever, that at the beginning a measure of confusion prevailed. It was perhaps inevitable that in the rst few months after the foundation of the Christian Community, a number of Anthroposophists joined the religious movement without adequate discrimination. When Rudolf Steiner saw the danger of this de velopment he found ways and means to stop it. In a celebratedlecture (Dornach, December 30, 1922), he drew a rm distinction between the functions of the anthroposophical and the religious body: they are as different from each other, he said, as the cir culatory and the nervous system in the human being. And he addedthat those who had found their way into Anthroposophy have no need for religious renewal. It cannot be denied that this lecture caused a hostile attitude against the Christian Community amonga number of Anthroposophists. I have hesitated in referring to this incident, since it belongs perhaps rather to the internal history of the Anthroposophical Movement. But my attention has been drawn to the fact that Ais lecture is not seldom referred to as an orientation on principle regarding Anthroposophy and religion, and it therefore needs to be considered in this context. T aken by itself, without its histoncal setting, it can indeed be bewildering. But in the historical mood at the time when the Anthroposophical Society passed .throughh e r o i c g r o w i n g p a i n s i n b e c o m i n g a w o r l d m o v e m e n t .

Furthermore, he regarded it as a matter of course that for the great events of life\u2014baptism, marriage, burial \u2014 Anthroposophists should turn to the Christian Community. In fact, he set the example for it himself. It is evident that the problem threatens to become one-sided, and perhaps even somewhat unreal, if one treats Anthroposophy and religion in terms of a primitive \" either \"\u2014\" or \". The relation ship is more subtle. I have always found it helpful that on occasion Rudolf Steiner compared the relationship between the Anthro- posophical Society and the Christian Co^unity\u2014and by implication between Anthroposophy and Religion\u2014^with the relationship between the three functionally differentiated spheres of the Three fold Commonwealth. He who understands the one will understand the other, he said. For in Steiner's conception the three functional spheres of the Threefold Commonwealth are also \" clearly differentiated in the eld of ideas, but come together in the human being \". This indication is wonderfully illustrated in the monumental lectures on \" Cosmology, Religion, and Philosophy \", which Rudolf Steiner gave in Domach from September 6-15, 1922, in Ae evenings of the rst week of the foundation events of the Christian Com munity. If Rudolf Steiner could have stayed with us longer, if he had not been so tragically taken away from us at a comparatively early age and at a crucial moment in the development of the Anthro- posophical Society, I believe he would have said and done many more things\u2014^perhaps contradictory on the surface\u2014to elucidate this important subject of Anthroposophy and religion. But what ever he might have done\u2014in a sense it is rather futile to entertain such speculations\u2014he would have safeguarded above everything the freedom of decision for the individual in this matter. It is quite possible that he made some apparently contradictory remarks on purpose in order that no one should be able to misuse his authorityand to dogmatise on the subject. The most un-Steiner like attitude is taken up by people who pick out one single statement and say: Now here Dr. Steiner has made it exactly clear what he thmks about Anthroposophy and religion. In the last analysis, the relationshipbetween Anthroposophy and religion is not an academic problem \u2014only hairsplitting intellectuals may be attracted to a theoreUcaldiscussion of the subject\u2014 but a problem of life which mdividual people will solve differently, and perhaps even solve differently during different periods of their life. And they must be left freeto do so. . . t Some complicate the issue by introducing the question of\" need \". Do I \" need \" religion, they ask, if I have Anthroposop^? This question seems to me as intelligent as if someone asks. Do I need to drink tea in the afternoon if I have coffee for breakfast?Of course there is no \"need\" to do so. But many people will witness to the enrichment of their lives which comes from having both. And they should be left free to do so. * There is one side to the problem which has arisen more insis tently and universally than in Steiner's life-time: the religiouseducation of children and the religious life of people. More and more anthroposophical families have children, and manyhundreds of children go to Rudolf Steiner schools every year .

In America all is doing. The wheels of fortune do not turn, they whirl. Success is meteoric, failure calamitous. And all the time the millions multiply, millions of souls, billions of dollars. Men earn and spend luxuriously. Yet many grime in the shadow of machines, machine in the cloudy dust of enterprise, and many lose their way or are shunted off to nowhere! Time is a merciless taskmaster. Gray hairs are not wanted. America is young\u2014^perilously young. History piles up in decades. Americanhistory is compulsory in all schools, but all eyes look front: the backward glance is rare. And yet, America has a past of a kind, a brief but crowded past.Here more sharply than elsewhere this century has left a world behind to face a new. A few decades have lifted America to the pinnacle of western economic power. A few decades more andAmerican policy will be determinative for this whole terrestrial globe. Where will the power lie then, east of west or west of east?What manner of power ? Soviet triumphs inake a stir, but the West is the master-genius of the machine: American enterprise demands it. American limbs seem born for it. It is hardly conceivable that the East will prevail. What will prevail in the West, machine or man? ,, America is proud of her late origin; proud of the moral heroism and endurance of her rst settlers; proud of her spontaneous, non- traditional constitution. Yet does what ruled in her sturdy fore runners still rule to-day? Is the spirit of the early fathers the spirit still of modern America ? What is the spirit of America ? Matter Over Man Early morning. The approach to New Y ork harbour. Hazeand low-hanging clouds. A massive front of buildings soaring skywards.

America is the mill of the modem age; it grinds old grain, all grain, into a new flour\u2014American flour, American bread, American economy, American independence, the American way of life. What is the American way of life? This multiple society under its one flag is startlingly recent. All of this America, apart from its few indigenous Indians, is a product of this modem age, is post-renaissance. In its brief history Com memoration Day stands for a pristine moment. An eighteenth- century church in Boston is labelled \"ancient monument.\" Howmuch is left in modem America of the high resolves which gave it birth? Even a hundred years ago, less than a hundred, the fever of modem enterprise had not as yet set in. There was an Emerson, a Lincoln, a Whitman, and there were many others lesser known abroad\u2014^men of heart and vision drawing their strength from the core of their own manhood, true singers and true servants of the times of which they dreamed. A world in the making, and the watchword. Liberty! Statue of Liberty! There it stands, but whatnow spreads out behind it? The prevailing word naively stated still is Liberty, but the overall drive is for money and possession. Men in their millions measure life by goods. The dollar is become the overlord. What do they actually possess, these millions? A house which they do not own, a car which they do not own, television sets, washing-machines, labour-saving devices and gadgets of all kinds,even clothes on their backs which they often do not own ^^raat do they possess? Their lives are heavily mortgaged to things they donot own\u2014mortgaged to pa3mients and insurance pohcies which must at all costs be maintained. Credits are persuasively encour aged. Holidays abroad on credit. Enjoy to-day and pay tomorrow\u2014on easy , attractive terms! Whilst factories are chiding out their goods and markets are flowing over with stocks, tn\u00aeje is always the haunting fear of a slump, of unemployment and suddenrain. In the scramble to keep up with the latest and the best, tte latest being stmonymous with best, wives, too, must work. One eye at least on the neighbour and his latest acquisition. T o possessless than he is to lose face, is mental torture and disgrace. Children, too, must have the best, everything that credit can provide, everything but their parents' time. T ime is the direst c^modity of aUand offers no credit. But in an apartment flat, with parents busy, time hangs heavy on the children. T elevision can take care oftelevision aU day and every day . T elevision instructs, comforts and consoles not only children but all ages\u2014television, and, as need arises, the psychiartrist. A m e r i c a s t a n d s t o - d a y a s t h e m o s t p o w e r f u l n a t i o n i n t h e w o r l d\u2014a power vested in the dollar. American influence extends as far as the dollar will allow. Economics thus becomes a primary affair of government. Production at highest pitch, three shifts a day. Production in turn demands consumption. At home and abroad, men must buy. Here the techniques of psychology come to the aid of an art of advertisement which is rafliless and prolic. Adver tisement virtually controls the newspapers, the radio, the television programmes; it blares out goods wi& merciless insistence at alltimes and everywhere. As for the goods, surface gloss, quick per formance, rapid decay\u2014^these will keep ^e wheels going round. The margin between purchase and repair is reduced to a negligible quota. Repair means individual labour and labour is all too costly . Why bother to repair when a little extra will procure the latest andthe best? The result is dumps of wreckage, eyesore dumps which nevertheless guarantee a speedy turnover . How long can this last? Production must not cease at any cost. Production seriously arrested would mean large-scale unemployment. Since nerves are frayed already and pockets compromised, this would quickly leadto panic and panic to upheaval and the fearful threat of com munism. The only alternative would then be war\u2014^war produces and consumes fearfully . This is the nightmare spectre in tiie back ground\u2014^production for war as a means for maintaining peace.This precisely is the situation in the world. The war potential over all this globe has risen to such dizzy heights of horror Aat the mind reels back refusing to contemplate. Forced prosperity and mounting fear become close companions in their search for safety methods to avert disasters. Controls become a necessity, centralisation an accepted fact. And now ideologies appear as benefactors in the name of all the virtues. One way or another. Communism appears to win.Were this to happen\u2014and what is to prevent it?\u2014it would be a terrible travesty of all the hopes that lived in all the hearts which yearned so passionately for moral independence and inner freedomat the founding of America By what magical force of human nature can those hopes be still upheld against the anti-human eoCT cions implicit in the world straggle to-day\u2014a straggle in which Amenca is obliged to play the most dominant role?

That is the wonder of Amenca.A small lecture-theatre in a State College in Ae West. Sometwo hundred young men and women ll the auditorium. It is a voluntary class in philosophy instituted by the lecturer . Attentionis eagerly concentrated on what he says. In a world of things, what is the state of man? That is the ruling question which underhes the course. The following excerpts are from a lecture he dehvered to an audience of lecturers. They give the ghting position of the man. , ..... \"The ailment of our civilisation which has been incubatmg for centuries and has nally reached its period of cnsis is called the depersonication of man and of reality as a whole. Ihe^ ^personication of man consists in reducing man to a beha^g tmng . . . Now the characteristic of a thing that merely behaves xs ...that it can be manipulated and placed within a scheme of other things like a pawn or any other object that is predictable m whatit can be or do. A thing is devoid of self-determination, of seff- valuing and of self-possessed action.... A thing cares not whetheit has being or has no being at all, nor does it care if other thmgare or not. ... A thing does not love, does not hate, does not develop despair nor dread of its very being. A thing isconvenient. ... A thing is the very antithesis of a person. Andit is well indeed that things have this character, for they are made to be used\u2014that is their nature. Their supine, unself-determining character is the whole of their worth. , ,, , ,\" Men are not impersonal things. Men do not merely behave, they act. They are not merely objects of observation. They ^e subject-agents who maintain whatever being they have by makingchoices and who know intimately what it means to make such choices. They are self-observers, they are self-conscious. Men can choose to be ' things', of course, as &ey have done many times in history and are now doing on an unprecedented scale. . . . WhatI am trying to say is that men are not simply capable of choosing; they are the actual fact of this choosing, and this is another way of saying that they represent the living fact of freedom in the world, however conditioned by outer circumstances. . . . \"The tragedy of our civilisation, as I see it, is that the thing- pattern has been gradually and insidiously extended to man himself and to all his doings. And this has been accomplished, some times deliberately, by power-seekers disguised as statesmen, educa tors, philosophers, and even as leaders of man's spiritual life, but more often by scientic scholarship without wisdom. . . . \"Man is not merely something that can be known about: he can know himself, and, indeed, must, if he is to choose himself. And the choice of himself, the choice of his freedom, is the funda mental fact about a man. . . . Now it is incredible that such a patent fact could ever have been forgotten. Yet, this is precisely what has happened, and this self-oblivion of man is all the more fearsome considering that it has found its way into the souls of 50men who were origmally dedicated to the principles of personalised life and freedom. . . . \"The incontrovertible fact is that we, who had chosen to become the trustees of spiritual reality, that is, of the self-deter mined person, we who had lit beacons of light over the oceans of the world, we who generated by our faith in the human person a new condence in the subject-agent who is man. ... we too, seemingly, are engulfed in this universal somnolence, this self- forgetfulness, this hypnotic fascination for an externalized and depersonied view of man. For us, too, I am afraid, man is begin ning to behave like a rat in a maze.\"I submit, ladies and gentlemen, that this is the view of man we consciously or unconsciously impart to our young people m himdreds of colleges and universities all over this land. I subnut, also, that as long as we are part of this fraud, which is ehmmatmgthe self-determining subject from human history , we shall remain accomplices in this greatest of all crimes ever to be perpetr^ed against mankind. I am not referring to atom bombs their consequences, but to that real annihilation of man which is the self-denial of the freedom that he personally represents m the w o r l d . \" . , , This splendid man had found a philosophy class of meagre academic interest for the few and had turned it mto an en- thusiastic crusade in defence of man.

For Goethe, nature embodied the idea. In the idea, man was at one with nature. \"Men being only on the path to progress may see equally yet think and interpret differently. This for Goethe did not mean that there could be several truths, but rather particularized versions of one universal truth. The idea is indivisibly one. As men over came their separate limitations, he expected there to come a time when the one all-illuminating truth would become common revela- tion\u2014^revelation not approaching man as a gift of ^ace from above but as the fruit of his own growing. This for him was the path to freedom. Thus Goethe's studies of nature and his evolution of Faust followed exactly the same metood. \"Goethe saw man standing within the kingdoms of nature, parrving within him the very same laws which he might bekold ormind him but transformed, metamorphosed, raised to a level h e r e t h e y l i t u p i n h i m a s t h e a l l - c o n t a i n i n g i d e a o f h i s o w n e x i s -tence. Nature was not bound to the physical senses, but could extend for human vision to include the divine world-order. There were no denable limits to human growing, no denable limits to all-ruling nature.\"Here was a view of man totally unlike that of to-day, a viewwhich placed man centrally within the entire world-process. Goethe's scientic work lay more or less forgotten and discredited in the archives at Weimar, where he had lived and worked. It was rst brought to light in an ordered form by Rudolf Steiner, who stands still to-day as Goethe's foremost interpreter, but even so Goethe's way is scarcely acknowledged. The most ardent admirers of his poetry still shrug their shoulders at his science, although he himself was convinced that his scientic work would have far greater value for posterity. Instead, we have learned to analyse man down to his material elements and then to seek in matter for an explanation of his manhood. Wisdom is not knowledge. Knowledge analyses life, wisdom promotes it. We have much knowledge, but in terms of wisdom the modern view of man is utter folly, for it denies man to himself.\" The world to-day is suffering dreadfully from this folly. That which Goethe felt and demonstrated by his life, that Rudolf Steiner advanced to Anthroposophy\u2014a word which may be interpreted as a wisdom-lled understanding of man. It is understanding of man that we above all need. This requires something different from the analytical faculties on which we have learned whoUy to rely. Goethe, the artist-scientist, possessed such faculties. Steiner shows us how we may acquire them.\" ^ The talk concluded, there was a volley of applause. Young students came running out of the lectiure-theatre demanding what they could do next. Here is a further tribute to America. Recognition is swift and lasting if the encounter is with actual experience. It has been said that Americans want evident proof before they can accept. Y es. but there is a quick, intuitive sense for the quality , the validity of a man's utterance, and that is proof. It I'\u00ae\u00ae\" said that America is quick to applaud, quick to forget. Maybe, but there are ever those who are awake and aware, who applaud with their hearts and never forget. They are realists in ideas, idealists in action, direct, immediate. They are to be met everywhere, in them is the hope of the land. Examples could be multiplied to show that in this land si^e-thing is working in the depths which belies the outer face of things, something remarkable and rare, new and ultta-modern, promise ota new type of manhood, a new type of consciousness. It needs only to grow awake to itself. , , There was an occasion when a number of young people, teacners, actors, artists, scientists, met for a week-end conference. Attentionwas drawn to the deliberate distinction made by Galileo and hisfollowers between the primary and the secondary qualies.

The story of America is likeno other story , for it was bom of the age we live in, and this age is itself still in its early beginnings. What the eye sees is the after- working of Galileo's impulse, is mechanisation, automation, man triumphing over matter and falling victim to it. Here the demonsof depersonication work with untold force. But, by a miracle there is here also a freshness of outlook, a freedom from bias, an immediacy of perception, a readiness for moral action for which the world waits. Here in the merging of races, nations, types of all kinds, there is slowly forming a type of man beyond all these; for him the earth wiU nd new meaning in the fellowship of stars and man new meaning in the fellowship of divine Beings.

Freedom stands only at the end. * America is in very truth the child of the New Age. Her soil was preserved for centuries on centuries for this particular time. Christ sent his disciples out to all the world: their mission was to prepare for a World Pentecost. America is the greatest spiritual experiment of all times. To America have come human elementsfroni all the world, awaiting the promise of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Truth, the Comforter. No wonder that all inimical powers are also gathered there. The true spirit of America tells of the ever-youthful,-ever- becoming and germinating forces of true manhood which aredestined to overcome the world. Over against this, America is in danger of becoming a world-dominating political Power such asthe world has not yet seen. Y et the true spirit of America is there. It is not conned to America, for it belongs to the age we live in and to all the world. There is this difference. Whereas the best that is in Asia speaks from ancient understanding and the best that is in Europe out of an enlightened heart, what is new and native in modem America springs from the loins: her young and fecund nature aches to give birth. America needs the best that is in Asia, the best that is in Europe, to nd and to know the best that is in herself. America especially must learn that East and Middle and West are Three in One. The Age of the Apocalypse has surely begun. It is the age in which men must either waken to conscious freedom in the spirit or sink to sub-human levels of self-oblivion. Against this impulse to freedom will rise all the forces that bind man to his lesser nature: it is here that the powers and mights conducive to unfreedom have their rm roots. Dire evidence of this we have already seen. The Old Adam will not die readily, nor will the New Adam nd an easy birth.In the greater struggles to come, America must play a leading part. She has yet to prove that the New World was born for a New Age, that the New World is intended to be the ground of preparation for a World Pentecost. The greatest temptations andthe greatest hopes lie in America. By all the signs and tokens of our times, in the totality of events from East to West, America is, of all lands, the land of choice between moral ascent to freedom in spirit and wholesale subjugation to instinct and to matter\u2014the land of the Apocalypse.Jack the Giant-Killer and Ourselves* Isabel Wyatt I N t h i s a g e o f t e c h n i c a l s c i e n c e , M a n ' s i n t e l l i g e n c e , w h i c h o n c eflowed into him from the Gods, now breaks free and confronts him in his own inventions. Demonic powers, which seek to make him a soulless robot, slip into his machines, and his mechanised civilization plunges towards the abyss. It can be saved only by the rebirth in him of a form of perception which can penetrate spintual realms and so alter the direction of his course. But where fonnerlythis higher perception was instinctive, god-bestowed, now it must be striven for and wholly conscious. Can any contemporary question, then, be more urgent, morefundamental, than the question as to how we are to encompass this The suggestion that fairy-tales could have a vital bearing on any contemporary question must seem to modern thinking bizarrebeyond belief. Y et Rudolf Steiner includes an understanding otthem among the approaches to this supersensible sight.\" In our time,\" says Dr . Steiner , \" begins that new ^8\u00ae winch it becomes necessary again to nd access to higher worlds, ror this a certain transition must be established; and it is scarcely possible to make this transition more simply than by a sensiblerevival of a feeling for fairy-tales. Between that spiritual world to which Man can raise himself by clairvoyance and the world of the intellect and the senses, the fairy-tale is perhaps the truest of all mediums. The very way in which the modest fairy-tale approaches us, not laying a claim in any sense to be an image of external reality,but boldly disregarding all outer laws of external realities, makes it possible for the fairy-tale to prepare the human soul to receive againthe higher spiritual world.\" (Symbolism and Fantasy). Fairy-tales, then, are not written in earthly language, about earthly events; they are written in supersensible language about supersensible events. For the world of the fairy-tale is this very world to which we ourselves must now aspire. In the fairy-tale are preserved records of what that earlier god-bestowed perception sawand experienced there. Thus the fairy-tale can familiarise us with the sort of world we ourselves shall nd there when we reach it, as travellers' tales can prepare us beforehand for a sojourn in some land beyond the seas. _ \" The rst starting-point of all true fairy-tales, says Dr. Steiner, \" was the remains of a primeval clairvoyance. In conditions between sleeping and waking, the veil of the physical world was lifted, an * The version of Jack the Giant-Killer quoted is from a Chapbook of 1805 in the British Museum. 59 58the spiritual world became visible.\" {The Interpretation of Fairy- Tales).In these intermediate states, atavistic instincts and impulses which had outgrown their legitimate limits of space and time were seen by a man as giants\u2014\" the facsimile of his own former figure in those olden times, when he had not yet withdrawn himself from the Nature-forces, where men could control the weather, and in the howling windstorm tear up trees\u2014^men of immense strength, men possessed of a giant form. Through that which is the giant in man, through strength, everything was fashioned. But the giants are stupid, because they belong to a time when men could not use the Intellectual Soul; they are strong, but stupid.\" {The Interpretation of Fairy-Tales). The giant, then, belongs to the astral world, in which Man still legitimately becomes a giant, his astral body in sleep expandingover the whole realm of the stars. But when the giant powers encroach, they become inimical and destructive. Then those who experienced that spiritual vision which gave us our fairy-tales sawanother gure set over against them, a gure small and young and physically weak, but conscious, wide-awake, endowed with keen reasoning and nimble presence of mind.\" Shrewdness, aptly applied skill, is the quality of the Conscious ness Soul, far removed from the strength of the giants; and these shrewd forces, in all sorts of cunning ways, overcame the rough forces which otherwise would have dominated life. The inadents of Ms own inner life which can still be perceived by Man in the spiritual world include the overcoming of the rough forces of the giants by the forces of intelligence and shrewdness.\" {The Inter pretation of Fairy-Tales). Sometimes, in the fairy-tale, this small, shrewd gure is a poor boy helped by a precocious cat or fox; sometimes he is a cleverlittle tailor . He is small and young because he is man's late^ attribute, the then newly dawning Consciousness Soul. In English fairy-tales he is often named Jack; we meet him in Jack and the Beanstalk, in Jack and the Snuffbox, in How Jack went to seek his Fortune', and we meet him in purest archetype in Jack the Giant-Killer , a fairy-tale of particular signicance to the English-speaking peoples on account of the light it throws on their own tasks and nature, and the increase in self-knowledge it can bring to them. FiMf Adventure of Jack the Giant-KHler The rst words of Jack the Giant-Killer make the mind sit upwith a start. It opens, not with \"Once upon a time,\" but with\" When good King Arthur reigned.\" , , , j WTiat inner connection can there be between Jack and good King Arthur ?Dr. Steiner speaks of the \"Arthur Stream\" as \"carrying the cosmic image of Christ as Sun-Hero from Ireland and England 60across North and Central Europe, bringing the Impulse of the Sun, the Michael Impulse, into earthly civilization.\" {London Lecture). \"The task of the Knights of King Arthur, under the name of knightly 'Adventure,' was to civilize Europe at a time when thespiritual life of Europe still stood under the influence of strange elemental beings who worked right into the life of Man.\" {Lectures on Karma). \"Legends of King Arthur's Round T able give in pictures theexternal facts of inner Mysteries taking place in the dawn of our epoch. These pictures point to the efforts made by the souls ofmen who were making progress in regard to the rening and cleansing of the forces of the astral body , which for the seer cameto expression in the imagery of monsters, giants, etc. {The Mysteries of Christianity and of the East). \"The Round Table,\" Malory tells us, is the round world. So Jack lived and did his doughty deeds in the climate or a com munity whose mission was to be the core of a world-wide hxmanculture, for which they worked by subduing monsters and giants both in the outer world and in their inner selves. When good King Arthur reigned, there lived near the Land's End of England a farmer's son called Jack. He was brisk and of a ready, lively wit, so that nothing and nobody could worst him. Here, indeed, stands the authentic Consciousness SoM! And yet already in it there are glimpses of a realm of life missing in theclever little tailor or the vagrant boy who owns a Puss-in-Boots. His occupation is signicant; Jack is a farmer's son. Not only does he stand rmly on the Earth; he also works with the Earth in friendly partnership, each giving the other gifts.His home, also, is signicant. Already this reveals him as m the Celtic stream, for Cornwall is the last stronghold of the Celt in England. Old Cornish folk call Land's End Pen-von-las, the Endof Sie Earth. Beyond it lies the lost land of Lyonesse, its churches, meadows, cornelds, woods, washed over by the sea. So Jack's Earth lies close to Water; master of mineral matter though he is, he lives very near the borders of the etheric. In those days the Mount of Cornwall was kept by a huge giant named Cormoran. He was eighteen feet in height, and about three yards round the waist, of a erce and grim countenance, the terror ofall the neighbouring villages. He lived in a cave in the midst of the Mount: and whenever he wanted food he would wade over to themainlanit and take it, tying sheep and hogs round his waist like a bunch of tallow-dips. He had done this for many years, so that all Cornwall was in despair. if Jack's home is signicant, Cormoran's is even more so. For we know the Mount of Cornwall to-day as St. Michael's Mount, \"^e Book of Landaff calls it Dinsol, the Castle of the Sun,Druidic days it was a centre of solar Mysteries. When, in 495. 61Michael stood on its rocky side and spoke to shermen in the bay below, it was given the Saxon name of Mychelyroz, Michael's Place\u2014to whom should the Castle of the Sun belong if not to that mighty archangel who is Planetary Regent of the Sun? When Jack plans to rescue it from the decadent powers who wrongfully hold it to the grievous hurt of the whole countryside, he is already ghting in the spirit of the Arthur Stream, \" that carries the Michael Impulse into earthly civilization.\" Jack got a horn, a shovel and a pickaxe, and went over to theMount in the beginning of a dark winter's eventag. Before morninghe had dug a pit twenty-two feet deep and nearly as broad, coveringit over with long sticks and straw. Then he strewed a little mould over it, so that it appeared like plain ground. , Jack then placed himself on the side of the pit furthest from the giant's lodging; and just at the break of day he put the horn to his mouth and blew: Tantivy! Tantivy! , This noise roused the giant, who rushed from his cave,tumbled into the pit, making the very foundations of the Mount to shake.* Jack, the Consciousness Soul at home upon the Earth, the farmer s son in alliance with the Earth, uses farm tools and the Earth itselr when he digs his trap for Cormoran. He waits for the helptul moment of sunrise before he wakes the giant and lures him to his doom. For the Night-man, grown as wide as the cosmos, must shrink to the dimensions of the physical body when he becomes Day-man. \"In sleep,\" says Dr . Steiner . \"ancient his soul expanded into the universe: at sunrising he contracted into theworld of external reality .\" (Symbolism and Fantasy). \"Oh. Giant,\" quoth Jack, \"where are you Pound.\" , ,. . , He gave him a most weighty knock with his pickaxe on the very crown of his head, and killed him on the spot. Jack searched the cave, and found much treasure He was givena sword and a belt, on which was written in letters ot goia. Here's the right valiant Cornishman Who slew the giant Cormoran. The death-blow Jack deals Cormoran is described with such precision that the picture conjured up is that of the point pickaxe entering the fontanel and extinguishing the aecaaentclairvoyant consciousness associated the pin^l . Cormoran's accumulated treasure of dream-wisdom becomes Jack s;his exploit is recorded in his aura: with the acquisition of swori^nbelt he achieves the rst stage of his gradual transformation trom farmer's boy to Knight of the Round T able. * Visitors to St. Michael's Mount to-day are still shown \"the Giant's Well, the pit in which Jack trapped Cormoran.\"Second Adventnre Four months later.

After Jack had retired to bed, he heard the giant muttering in the next apartment;\" Though here you lodge with me this night, You shall not see the morning light;^ My club shall dash your brains outright.\" So up Jack got from his bed, laid a billet of wood in his place, and hid in a corner of the room. At the dead time of the night, in came the giant, and pounded the bed with his club. Next morning, Jack gave the giant hearty thanks for his night^s lodging.\" How have you rested?\" quoth the giant. \" Were you disturbed at all in the night?\"\" Only by a rat,\" replied Jack, \" who gave me two or three slaps w i t h h e r t a i l . \" . , ^ , t . i r . With that, greatly wondering, the ^ant led Jack to breakfast, bringing him a bowl containing four gallons of hasty pudtog. Jackp u t a i M g e l e a t h e r b a g u n d e r h i s l o o s e c o a t , a n d p o u r e d t h e p u d d i n g show you a trick,\" Jack told the giant. And he took a knife, and ripped open the bag: and out came the h a s t y p u d d i n g . ^ .\" I can do that trick myself,\" the giant vaunted. But when he did so, he fell down dead. It is at \"the dead time of the night,\" when noimally he wouldhave been unconscious in sleep, that Jack s danger is greatest. But 62the course of the story hints that a certain occult development is beginning to imfold in him; he is learning to remain conscious dxu\u00b1ng sleep. And when morning comes, so shrewd is his Day-man intellect that he is able to lead the giant into encompassing his own downfall. Fourth Adventure Now it happened in these days that King Arthur's only son was journeying into Wales, in search of a beautiful lady who was possessedwith seven evil spirits. His father had given him two horses, one for him to ride, the otherladen with money. He came to a market-town, where he beheld a vast crowd of people; when he asked the reason, he was told: \"They are arresting the corpse of a man who has died owing l a r g e s u m s o f m o n e y . \" ^ \"Go bury the dead man,\" said the creditorscome to my lodging, and there their debts shall be paid. They did so, and came in such numbers that by nightfall thePrince had only two pence left for himself. Now Jack the Giant-killer, coming that way was so taken withthe generosity of the Prince that he desired to be his servant, and next morning they set forward on their journey together. As they were riding out of the town, an old woman called atter the Prince, saying:\" He has owed me two pence these seven years. Pray pay me as the rest.\" So the Prince gave the old woman all he had left. King Arthur's son gives us, as he gave Jack, an immediate impression of selfless nobility; we recognize in mm the personalitystriving for its highest Egohood. He bears with him a treasure oinherited Sun-forces; for , in the Round T ables reflection of the h e a v e n s . K i n g A r t h u r i s t h e S u n . . u .But the Prince does not selshly clutch and hide that treasure,as the giants do; in paying the dead man's debts with it he d free deed of love and sacrice.

Then he went for his master, and brought him into the castle, where they made merry and slept well. Early next morning Jack furnished the Pnncewith gold and silver, and sent him three miles forward on his journey. Then he led the giant out of his underground vault. \"What shall I give you. Cousin Jack,\" asked the giant, \"for keeping my castle safe ?\"\" I want nothing,\" Jack told him, \" but the old coat, cap, sword and shoes which are at your bed's head.\" \"Y ou know not what you ask,\" quoth the giant. \"They^e the most precious things I have. The coat will keep you invisible; the cap will tell you all you want to know; the sword cuts asunder whatever you strike; the shoes are of extraordinary swiftness. But you have been very serviceable to me. Therefore take them with all my heart.\" So Jack took them and joined the Prince. It is their lack of money which directs them to the castle of this giant with whom Jack has a blood-connection, whose store of ancient supersensible riches would appear to be honestly come by . 64and whom Jack does not seek to slay, since this giant uncle's might is not exercised tyrannously, and all he asks is not to be molested as Night-man, but to be left in peace in the darkness of his under- groxmd vault till the menace of the Day-man has passed. Out of this accumulated treasure from the night-world Jack enriches the Prince, and himself bears away a four-fold reward which marks a further stage in his development towards a re awakening of higher organs of the soul.He receives a coat of darkness to make him invisible. That is, he learns to move in the realms of the night-consciousness with the wakeful awareness of the day-consciousness, even when released from the physical body of which this wakefulness had hitherto been an attribute. He receives a cap which will tell him all he wants to know, for his strengthened powers of imaginative thought have freed them selves from the hmiting logic of the waking intellect. He receives the sword which cuts asunder whatever you strike; he has made himself master of the destructive forces of the spinal consciouness, that inner will which regulates organic activity during sleep, but which, if it breaks into our waking life, manifests as antipathy.He receives the sword of swiftness, moving securely in those realms of the supersensible where the earthly physical laws of time and space cease to operate. . , * lie four gifts together reveal Jack as having reaped me hapest of life rightly lived in the sense-world at the level of the Conscious ness Soul, in that through this he has become so rmly established within himself that he remains fully self-possessed, vigilant and able to wield sound judgment even in the midst of this other welling, weaving world of perpetual transformations. . , \u00bbIn what follows he is able to use the four gifts in the Pnnce s service. King Arthur's son and Jack went on tiU to the houseof the lady. She prepared a splendid b^quet, after ste toldthe Prince she had a task for him. She wiped his mouth with handkerchief, saying: . , ^\" Y ou must show me this handkerchief to-morrow morning, or else lose your head.\" So saying, she put the handkerchief into her bosom. The Prince went to bed inknowledge told him how to obtain the w t\u00aeof the night the lady called on her famdiar spirit to rLucifer. But Jack put on his coat of darkness and his shoes ot s w i f t n e s s , a n d w a s t h e r e a s s o o n a s s h e w a s . jWhen she entered the palace of the Old One she f ye the hM^kerchief to old Lucifer, who laid it upon a sbelf. Jack took it fromthe shelf, and brought it to his master , who shewed it next day to the lady, and so saved fus life.On that day she gave the Prince a kiss, and told him: ^ \"T o-morrow morning you must show me the hps I shato-night, or else lose your head.\"\" Ah, if you kiss none but mine, I will,\" replied the Prince. At midnight she went to the pdace of the Old One as before, andwas angry with old Lucifer for letting the handkerchief go.\" But now,\" quoth she, \" I will be too hard for King Arthur's son, for I will kiss your lips, and how can he shew me those? , . This she did. But Jack, when she had departed, unsheatted^^^^sword which cuts asunder whatever you strike, and cut of f Luci^r shead. He brought this under his invisible coat to his master, whonext day pulled it out by the horns before Ae lady . This broke the enchantment: the evil spirits left her, and sheappeared in all her beauty. The Prince and ady were marriednext morntar and went back to the Court of King t^gJack with them. There Jack, for his many great exploits, was made a Knight of the Round Table. I n T h e E f f e c t s o f O c c u l t D e v e l o p m e n t o n t h e S e l f a i ^ S h e a t h s of Man, Dr. Steiner has a passage which throws light on this astonishing sequence. , , , ..\"Thus inner experience,\" he says, \"teaches us to know Luciferas the Night Spirit. It is part of the change that goes on in our self and our astral body (during an occult development) that at night we feel ourselves in the company of Lucifer. Y ou may per haps at rst think that it must be disagreeable to a person, when hegoes to sleep and becomes clairvoyant, to become aware that dunngthe night he comes into Lucifer's company . But if you reect more deeply, you will realize that it is better to know that we are in his company than to think that he is not there. ... .\"After his rst misleading of men, they were not permitted to see him any more; therefore the Divine-Spiritual Being who was watching over the progress of mankind had to draw a veU over thevision of the night. Sleep covers from man with darkness the world in which he is from the time of his going to sleep until he awakens. At the withdrawal of the veil which covers the night with darkness, we should instantly perceive Lucifer by our side. If man were strong enough, this would do no harm; but as at rst he could not be strong in the sense required by our earthly development, this veil had to be drawn during his sleep at night, so that no further misleadings, through the direct vision of Lucifer from the time ofhis going to sleep until reawakening, should come to man. . . .\" Man is now living towards a future when, each time he awakes, he will have\u2014at first Uke a fieeting dream, but later more clearly\u2014 the impression: 'Thy companion during the night was Lucifer.' In the ever-developing clairvoyant conditions of the human soul, the Luciferic influence will work principally during sleep, or in all the conditions which are indeed similar to sleep but in which there is consciousness.\" Jack, ierefore, through his uncle's gifts (that is, through occult development proper to our times) sees Lucifer as Night Spirit legitimately; the lady, through the possession by the \"seven back-ward Luciferic spirits who had remained behind upon the Moon,\" sees him irregularly and atavistically. not in accordance wiA our present stage of evolution, so that it is with profound spiritual exactitude that the fairy-tale characterises him in his connection with the lady as \"Old Lucifer\" and \"the Old One.\" The head belongs to the past; it is a metamorphosis, says Dr. Steiner, of the will-forces of the previous incarnation; and the hxunan embryo, like the tadpole, makes manifest that it is from the head that the rest of the body grows. So, in beheading Lucifer, Jack is severing for the lady her wrongly carried-over connection with former conditions of existence, now long passed away. \"Wherever the soul is not governed by the Ego or controlled by the spirit, Lucifer rules; this is the danger of soul without spirit.'\" (Emil Bock, The Apocalypse). But the lady, the soul, appears in all her beauty when she is redeemed by the Prince, the higher, Christ-lled Ego, who, through Jack's instrumentality, liberates her from the Luciferic obstacles to her true evolution and unites with her in love. Jack, on his part, receives recognition as a soul working in the service of the Michael Impulse\u2014he is made a Knight of the Round Table. Fifth Adventure Jack soon went searching for giants again. Near the entrance to a cave he saw a giant sitting on a block of timber, with a knotted iron club by his side. His eyes were likeflames of re, the bristles of his beard like rods of iron wire, his locks like curling snakes. Jack alighted from his horse, and put on the coat of darkness; then, coming close to the monster, he struck a sword-blow at his head, but, missing his aim, cut off his nose instead. At this, the giant roared like claps of thunder, and began to lay about him with h i s i r o n c l u b l i k e o n e s t a r k m a d . But Jack, running behind him, drove his sword up to the hilt in the giant's back, so that he fell down dead. This done. Jack cut off the giant's head, and sent it to King Arthur, by a wagoner he hired for that purpose. Jack now resolved to enter the giant's cave in search of his treasure. Passing along through a great many windings and turnings, he came to a large room, with a boiling cauldron, and a great t^ible, and a window barred with iron, through which he saw great numbers of miserable captives. Straightway imlocking the door, he set them free, and, searchingthe giant's coffers, shared the gold and silver equally among them. Then he took them to a neighbouring castle, to celebrate their deliverance. The giant's locks like curling snakes are reminiscent of Medusa's; like hers, they point to an atavistic mode of apprehension, belonging to a period before the lobes of the brain became static, when to clairvoyant sight they reached forth from the head with searchinghanHs \" Certain lobes of the brain which now lie enclosed in the skull,\" says Dr. Steiner, \" were freely mobile during the Old Moon 68evolution. T o-day they are rigid, and can no longer move physically; but they do move etherically when we think. If we had not this rm skull enclosing the lobes of the brain, we should stretch out these lobes and make gestures with them\u2014but we should not think. The lobes of the brain had rst to be made physically rigid, and it had to be possible for the etheric brain to tear itself free.\" (Occult Reading and Occult Hearing).In this giant, then. Jack has to overcome a decadent form of cognition inimical to the clear and highly conscious thinking rightfor the present stage of evolution; and it is signicant that he does so by running his sword into the giant's back, man's most uncon scious part. The picture of the head is unfolded further when Jack enters the cave, traversing there the many windings and turnings of the labyrinth of the brain within the hollow rock of the enclosing skull.A vision of the night-activity of the etheric body, the sheath that builds and nourishes, meets him in the boiling cauldron, preparing food to be set on the great table (for in sleep the digestive processes penetrate to the head), and in the captives, who, through their window, receive this nourishment only through the sense-impressions of sight, smell and sound. Fbr it is thus that Dr. Steiner, in The Effects of Occult Develop ment on the Self and Sheaths of Man, describes that experiencing of the etheric body at the moment of going to sleep which he calls the Grail Imagination\u2014the wounded earth-man in an inner room within the skull's stone walls, and, streaming up into the head to nourish and renew him, and with him the noblest portions of the brain, the purest and nest products of the senses, the purest and nest extracts of the metabolism's alchemy. The fairy-tale even indicates that it is, as Dr. Steiner says, at the moment of going to sleep that Jack meets this experience. For it tells us that he alighted from his horse (the waking day-intelligence) and put on his coat of darkness (the night-consciousness which remains aware, though freed from the physical body). The brain is quite specially the organ of the Consciousness Soul; it is the Consciousness Soul that shapes the convolutions of the grey cortex. When the Consciousness Soul can perceive and control the etheric body, it unfolds its highest faculties and ripens into the Imaginative Soul\u2014that is to say, it becomes that which Michael wills it to be in our time. The fairy-tale would seem to hint that Jack at this point reaches this stage of development. Sixth Adventure In the midst of all this mirth, a messenger brought news that one Thunderdell, a giant with two heads, having heard of the death of his kinsmen, had come from the northern dales to be revenged on Jack. He was now within a mile of the castle, which stood on a small island, surrounded by a moat thirty feet deep and twenty feet wide, 69over wkch lay a drawbridge. Jack had this bridge cut through on both sides ^ost to the middle; then, putting on his coat of darknessand taking his sword of sharpness, he marched against the giant. c r i e ^ o u t t h e g i a n t c o u l d n o t s e e J a c k , h e s m e l t h i s a p p r o a c h a n d \" Fee--fo-fum! I smell the blood of an Englishman. Be he alive or be he dead, Fll grind his bones to make my bread.\" \" You have rst to catch me,\" quoth Jack. And, putting on his shoes of swiftness, and throwing off his coatof darkness that the giant might see him, he ran from Thunderdell, who followed him like a walking castle, so that the very foundations of the Earth seemed to shake at every step. Jack led him a long dance, and at last ran lightly over the draw bridge, the giant pursuing him at full speed with his club. When the giant reached the middle of the bridge, where Jack had had it cut, his great weight broke it down, and he tumbled headlong into the moat, where he rolled and wallowed like a whale. Jack now got a cart-rope, which he cast over Thunderdell's two heads, and, with the help of a team of horses, drew him ashore. Then, cutting off both heads with his sword of sharpness, he sent them to King Arthur. The Consciousness Soul is an island in its detachment, its separation. The Imaginative Soul is an island in that its core ofEarth is embraced on all sides by Water. Both aspects play into this Thunderdell adventure. It is by means of the etheric (by plunging him into water) that Jack subdues this giant, passing condently from waking night- to day-consciousness, in which, with most practical application of intelligence, he uses a team of horses to bring his victim to land. By sending to King Arthur rst the head of the giant with the snake-locks, now Thunderdell's heads, and later that of Galligantua, Jack continually renews connection with the fountain-head of his striving. Seventh Advrature After some time Jack, taking leave of the knights and ladies he had rescued, set out for new adventures. Through many woods he passed, and came at length to the foot of a high mountain. Here, late at night, he found a lonesome house, and knocked at the door. It was opened by an aged man with a head as white as snow. \"Father,\" said Jack, \"can you lodge a benighted traveller that has lost his way?\"\" Yes,\" said the old man. \" You are right welcome to my poor cottage.\" Whereupon Jack entered. Down they sat together; and the old man said: \"Son, I see by your belt you are the great conqueror of giants;and behold, my son, on the top of this mountain is an enchanted castle, kept by a giant named Galligantua, who, by the help of an old conjuror, betrays many knights and ladies into his castle, where, by magic art, they are transformed into shapes other than their own.But above all I grieve for a duke's daughter, whom they snatched 70away from her father's garden, carrying her through the air in a burning chariot drawn by ery dragons, and securing her within the castle, where they transformed her into a white hind.\"\" Has no knight attempted,\" asked Jack, \" to break the enchant m e n t a n d w o r k h e r d e l i v e r a n c e ? \" \"Many knights have attempted it,\" the old man told him, \"yetnone could accomplish it, on account of two dreadful griins at the castle gates, who destroy all who come near. But you, my son, in your coat of darkness, may pass by them unseen; and on the gates you will nd engraven how the enchantment may be broken.\". At this. Jack gave the old man his hand, and promised him:\" In the morning I will venture my life to free this lady.\" In the morning Jack arose, put on his magic coat, cap, sword and shoes, and set out. When he reached the top of the mountain, he passed the two dreadful griins invisible and without fear. Beyond them, on the castle gates, he found a golden trumpet hung by a silver chain, and imder it these words engraved: Whoever shall this trumpet blow Shall Galligantua overthrow. And break the black enchantment straight; So all shall be in happy state. Jack blew the trumpet, and the castle trembled to its vast founda tions; the giant and the conjurer were in horrid confusion, biting their thumbs and tearing their hair, knowing their wicked reign was at an end. As the giant stooped to take up his club, Jack, at one blow, cut off his head, whereupon the conjurer, mounting up into the air, was carried away in a whirlwind. At once the enchantment was broken; all the lords and ladies who had so long been transformed into birds and beasts returned to their proper shapes; and the castle vanished away in a cloud of smoke. The head of Galligantua was conveyed to the Court of King Arthur, whither Jack followed, with the lords and ladies who had been delivered. Whereupon, as a reward for his good services. King Arthur prevailed upon the duke to bestow his daughter in marriage on honest Jack. So married they were; and the whole kingdom was lled with joy at the wedding. Furthermore, King Arthur bestowed on Jack a noble castle, where he and his lady lived in great joy and happiness all the rest of their days. The old man with the snow-white hair of heavenly wisdom, to whom Jack's way leads him at last, is like a memory of those lonely hermits, guardians of hidden spiritual knowledge, to whom the knights' in Malory , W olfram von Eschenbach and Chretien de Troyes come on the eve of their initiation. Jack goes forth from him next morning armed with all the gifts his development has brought him, aided by the old man's guidance, red by a new high quest\u2014the deliverance of the gently-bred duke's daughter who hasbeen reft away from that realm of pure and paradisal life, her father's garden, her innocent sense-longing turned into a white hind. (The stag is frequently a fairy-tale picture for sensitive and delicate heightened sense-impressions.)In place of the hunting-horn he blew on the Mount of ComwaU to arouse Cormoran, Jack now blows a golden trumpet, which, 71like Joshua's, can make stone walls tremble. There is even some thing a little apocalytic in the scene. Gianthood is ended; with the\" old conjurer \" (the bearer of retarding mediumistic forces) the last of the atavistic clairvoyance in ^e blood is whirled away; the castle of illusion vanishes; all that is decadent perishes; the lords and ladies under enchantment regain their human forms. When Dinsol, the Castle of the Sun, lapsed into the hands of Cormoran, atavistic forces seized what had once been given to Man by Michael, Lord of Cosmic Intelligence. Jack redeems that gift. All his exploits, all the stages of his own development, are steps in that redemption. The new faculty by which Man turns aside from the abyss, wresting his own downward path into the parabola of a new ascent, is bound up with this new Michael thinking, this new conscious clairvoyance, in which concept and percept become one. Jack, the brisk young farmer's son, has become a Knight of the Round Table, with a duke's daughter for bride and a castle of his own. In him the Consciousness Soul, furthering Michael's will, has attained nobility.The Search for Felix the Herb-Gatherer* Emil Bock I N t h e f a t e f u l y e a r 1 8 7 9 , w h e n t h e M i c h a e l A g e b e g a n \u2014 t h e a g e i nwhich we are now living\u2014Rudolf Steiner, who was then 18, had an important experience. He had come to live in the big city from a world in which he had been used to a very simple life, a world moreover that was then still strongly pervaded by the forces of nature. This was when he began his studies at the Technical College in V ienna. He needed to be escorted over the threshold ofthe modern world; and it was signicant for him that he found sucha guide in Felix the herb-gatherer , who understood plants as a friend and had a deep feeling for the spirit of the earth and all me processes of nature. In the Mystery Plays he is known as FelixBalde, and is a metamorphosis of the \"Man with the Lamp in Goethe's fairy-tale. It has often been remarked that the emergence of Rudolf Steiner from a rural family background reflected to some extent the destiny of mankind in the second half of the nineteenth century, rather as the advancing hand of a clock mirrors the passage of time. During his childhood and youth he was surrounded by the world of nature, but even then the early signs of a rising technical civilisation entered unobtrusively but decisively into his life. At Pottschach and Neudorfl his parents lived in the station- master's house outside or right on the edge of the village, so that the family was somewhat isolated from the other villagers. This part of the Austrian Southern line ran through an unspoilt regionwhere the railway still represented an innovation that was revo lutionising people's lives. The big moment of the day was always when the train came in or left! The elders of the village\u2014the mavor the parson and the schoolmaster\u2014would gather for the occLion And for the stationmaster's children, too, the most im- oortant room in the building was where father sat by his morse transmitter , receiving and passing on the telegraphic messages. The makeshift homes which the railway company provided for its employees were not intended for a setUed existence. RudolfSteiner's father was constantly being moved from one part of Lower * This article, based on a lecture given by the late Emil Bock in Stuttgart In Nnvember 1958 has been translated from the Christmas 1959 issue of theDeutschland by kindo/Lic. Emil Bock's daughter and literary executor, Frau Dr. Kacer-Bock.Austria to another , so that the boy's home was constantly changing.There was something symbolic about this, reminiscent of the way humanity has to be uprooted, when nature withdraws before the advance of civilisation. * Ckcumstances were such that Rudolf Steiner as a young lad experienced this transition in a very acute form. Hiis had to dowith the profound sympathy he felt for his father in all that thelatter went through emotionally . In The Story of My Life he says of his fa^er that he was not happy in his work: \"He saw the work of the railway as his duty, but he had no love for it Sometimes he was oh duty for three days and nights at a stretch. Then he would have 24 hours off. There was nothing colourful about his life. It was a dismal grey.\" This was not easy for \"one with,a passionate nature that was easily aroused, especially when he was a young man.\" How had the father come to take up this work? The answer takes us to a turning-point, a dramatic climax, in the life of this man of peace and goodwill. His own father\u2014Rudolf Steiner's grandfather\u2014had been a forester all his life. His whole existence was bound up with the life of the forest, which for him meant the immense undisturbed forests north of the Danube, stretching away to the Czech border and known to this day as the Waldviertel. He was responsible for one of the big areas of forest belonging to the Hoyos family.The whole ambition of Rudolf Steiner's father was to follow the same career. He had the job of gamekeeper, which led on to the position of forester, in the same part of the Waldviertel. The forest was his home, his world; and it was there that he would have liked to spend his whole life. But a difculty arose which nally compelled him to leave his native forest. He became engaged to a girl, who was also in the service of the Hoyos family at Schloss Horn, south of his own district of Geras. In those districts the old ideas of serfdom were not yet extinct, and it was on this basis that the Coimt was able to forbid the marriage. It seems that the young couple waited patiently for a long time, hoping their master would change his mind. In the end the riftcame suddenly, when Johann was already 32 and his ancee 27. No doubt approaching destiny\u2014later to be known as Rudolf Steiner\u2014was helping, from another world, to bring things to a head. At short notice Johann Steiner, who had now decided to marry, had to leave his beloved forest and look around for another job. What he found was work as telegraph operator on one of the new stretches of railway that were coming into existence everywhere and creating a sudden demand for workers. After a short time in Styria, possibly as a trainee, Johann Steiner was appointed station telegraph operator in a remote spot, 74far away on the Croatian border. It was a long way from his forest home\u2014in fact, one might say \"right out of the world.\" He was married in May, 1860, and in February, 1861, Rudolf was born. It was with dramatic violence that destiny thrust these quiet people into a homeless existence, when they left the life of the woods for the new world that was developing so rapidly with technical progress. All the time the growing lad could feel the homesickness which gnawed at his father's soul, sometimes causing him real distress. To the end of his days the older Steiner never really got over the change. It was natural that when in the nineties he was able to retire, he and his wife went back to the Waldviertel which was their home. * . In 1879, when Rudolf Steiner had nished at the Realschule in Wiener Neustadt at the age of 18, the Austrian Southern line kept its promise to his father to move him nearer Vienna to facilitatethe son's further education. The family left Neudorfl for the rail way town of Inzersdorf on the southern outskirts of Vienna, wherethe Southern line originally came to an end. From there the young student was able, once term started, to go in every day to his lectures. Even before that, during the summer holidays before lectures began, he often went into Vienna. This was how the meeting with Felix the herb-gatherer, which was to mean so much to him, came about: That is how I came to know an ordinary working man, who hajp- pened to go into Vienna every week on the same train as myself. He collected medicinal herbs in the country and sold them in Vienna to the chemists' shops. We became close friends. When he spoke of the spiritu^ world, one realised that it was from experience. He was a man of deep integrity and devotion, though no scholar. True, he had read a good deal of mystical literature, but what he said was quite uninfluenced by this reading. This was the direct product of his soul-life, in which there was an elemental creative wisdom. ... It was as though his personality was nothing but a mouthpiece for some spiritual being that spoke from occult worlds. With him it was possible to look deep into the secrets of nature. On his back he carried his bundle of herbs, but in his heart he carried the spiritual gifts he received from nature as he gathered his plants. ... So intime I began to feel as though I was in contact with a soul from distant times, who possessed an instinctive knowledge of the past,uninfluenced by civilisation, science and present-day ideas. {The Story of my Life, pp. 39-40.) Seeing him with this rural eccentric in the streets of Vienna, necDle would look round at them, as Felix shared his spiritual treasures with the young man, treasures that mankind has gradually lost on its Odyssey through time. In the autobiographical lecture given on February 1, 1913, at the conference marlang the founda tion of the Anthroposophical Society, Rudolf Steiner touched on the story of the herb-gatherer: 75In my rst year at college, something quite special had already happened ... a strange personality crossed my youthful path . . . despite scanty education, there was deep understanding and wisdom... . \"Felix,\" who lived with his peasant family in a remote and lonely little village in the mountains, had his room packed with occult and mystical literature and was himself deeply imbued with such wisdom.. . . Everywhere in the neighbourhood of his home he collected pl^jts of all kinds and could explain their essential nature and occult origins. There were tremendous occult depths in the man. It was remarkable what one could discuss with him, going with him on his lonely journeys. ... Obviously the lively intercourse v^hich Rudolf Steiner had withFelix did not take place only in the streets of Vienna, as they went from the South Station to the centre of the city. The two of them would sometimes go out together in the woods on early morning expeditions in search of herbs. The rst scene of the rst Mystery Play {The Portal of Initiation) shows Felix Balde replying to Benedictus's \"Your every word is more precious to me than I can say,\" with \"It was impertinence that made me so talkative when you did me the honour of letting me accompany you on our mountain walks.\" And in the rough draft, where the characters still bear the same names as in the Goethean fairy-tale, the \"Lily \" says to the \"Man with the Lamp\":\" He told me how he went round with you collecting herbs and how you led him into remote places, where rare flora were found growing on soil so thin that it barely covered the rock . . .\" On one occasion Rudolf Steiner visited Felix in his cottage in the place he called a \" quiet mountain village \". It was on June 22, 1919, in Stuttgart that he came to speak of this, when describing Felix once again: There is a spot in Lower Austria from which the view of the mountains, especially at sunset, is very ne, as you look south towards the Lower Austrian Schneeberg, the Wechsel and the northern fringe of the Styrian mountains. Here there is a small unassuming cottage with the following inscription over the door; In Gottes Segen ist alles gelegen (\"With the blessing of God all things are good\"). I have only once been in that house, and that was as a young man. Therewere no outward pretensions about the man who lived there. His occupation was to go about collecting medicinal herbs, and his house was crammed with them. Once a week he packed up the herbs in a knapsack and travelled with them on his back to Vienna. At thattime ... I had to follow the same route; we used to travel together to the South Station and then walk along the road leading into the Wieden district of Vienna. . . . This man's speech had a quite different ring from that of most people. When he spoke of theleaves on the trees or of the trees themselves, but njorc especiallywhen he spoke of the marvellous intrinsic properties of his medicinal herbs, it became apparent how closely this man s soul was bound upwith the whole spirit of that part of the countryside. . . . He wasin his own particular way a great sage. . . . ,^be herbs with which his little cottage was crammed, he had quite a library of notable books of all kinds\u2014which had this in common, that their principal features were related to the principal features and funda mental character of his own soul. He was not well off. There was 76not much money to be made from the trade in herbs, which had been collected in the mountains\u2014^in fact very, very little. But his face bore an expression of deep contentment and he possessed great wisdom. (From the cycle, \" Social and Pedagogical Questions in ie Light of Spiritual Science,\" lecture 7.) Everything Dr. Steiner said about the herb-gatherer suggested that there was some mystery surrounding his personality. It was particularly after he became well-known as Felix Balde and wasseen on the stage in the mystery plays in that guise, merging with Goethe's \"Man with the Lamp\", that he became a veritably mythical gure. The question of discovering some actual place where Felix had lived and whether anything could still be traced about the man himself was therefore approached with some hesita tion. However, some friends did try to nd out where the herb- gatherer had lived and what his name was in real life. For a long time it was denitely understood that his name was Felix Krakotzki and that he lived in Munchendorf, a quiet village near Laxenburg in the Hungarian Plain south of Vienna. This is the report I had in my hands in the forties: \" Count Polzer, Dr. Emil Hamburger and Dr. Walter Johannes Stein were in Munchendorf in 1919. A cobbler called Scharinger said Felix took messages to Vienna for a textile rm and collected herbs. He w^ the only person they found who had known Felix. He spoke of Felix as \"a joUy fellow and a great one for telling jokes in the inn. He had two sons, one of whom rented a farm near Miinchenhof in 1919. The other was a gamekeeper on the estate of Count Hoyos near Gutenstein \". These three friends, leading gures in the Anthroposophical Society , intended to follow up their enquiries in the church registers,but gave up on being told that all particulars had been destroyed. I was never able to understand their being put off so easily. Why, I wondered, did they not try and get in touch with one of the sons, who were said to be still alive? In 1950 I had the opportunity to visit Miiunchendorf myself. Unfortunately my visit had to be a very short one, as I had risked going without a passport into what was at that time still the Russian zone. I thought I might trace something not only of Felix but of Johannes Wurth, the village schoolmaster in Lower Austria, to whom Dr. Steiner had, without giving his name, made some striking allusions in the year 1919.Down in one of the back cottages of the village I came ^ross a headmaster's widow, then aged ninety . These villages Me bmlt mthe Hungarian manner. They consist of rows of si^le-storey houses stretching to right and left along the mam street.

TirThe old lady had quite a lot to say about Johannes Wurth, a l t h o u g h h e h a d d i e d a s f a r b a c k a s 1 8 7 0 . S h e h e r s e l f w a s a h e a d -master's daughter and had married her father's predecessor. Before long she was telling me of the detailed record which her father had kept, of events in Miinchendorf. This chronicle had recently dis appeared. She encouraged me to have a search for it and gave methe names of several very old villagers, who would be able to help me. We should be sure, she thought, to nd everything there that we needed. Finally I asked her about the herb-gatherer, Fehx. She remembered him at once; \"Yes, old Felix, he often used to come over to us in the evenings, Sundays especially; and after that he would sit in the inn with the men from the village.\" When I asked where he would have come from, at rst she could not say. After a time she said she thought he must have come from Laxenburg. This was the rst hint that Miinchendorf was not after all the home of the herb-gatherer. But all further enquiries undertaken by friends at that time were fruitless. During the years that followed, interest grew in Felix, and in the unresolved questions relating to his life. It turned out that the church registers for Miinchendorf as well as for Laxenburg and the immediate surroundings had been preserved intact; but there was no trace of anybody called Felix Krakotzki. There was one point on which aU who took part in these enquiries were in agreement: Miinchendorf in no way tted the description Dr. Steiner gave of Felix's home. In the fbrst place it was not a \" mountain village \", as it lay in the broad plain known as the \"Wiener Becken\". Secondly, there was surely no question there of seeing the mountains clearly of which Dr. Steiner had spoken, the wonderful formations of the Schneeberg, Rax and Wechsel in their sunset colouring. No further progress was made until the beginning of 1958, when preparations were under way for bringing out the Pddagogische Seminar lectures given by Dr. Steiner in 1919 at the foundation of the Waldorf School. A clue emerged that had been overlooked. In previous editions sentences had often been omitted, if they were not easy to read in the original notes. It how turned out that one such sentence referred to the home of the herb-gatherer: Recently I had occasion to explain that the man Felix lived inTrumau. The name of the old cobbler, who knew the archetype of Felix Balde, was Scharinger from Miinchendorf. ^ Fehx is still a hvmgtradition in those parts. All the characters to be found in my Mystery Plays are actual individuals. It suddenly became clear that Dr . Steiner had himself said where Felix Uved\u2014at Trumau. Nobody had taken in this fact before. Trumau is only 6 km. sonth of Miinchendorf and has just the same chstTstctciT The publication of this passage from the Pddagogische Seminar threw into sharp relief the whole question of how Mtinchendorf hadever come to be regarded as Felix's home; also why those friends who were in Miinchendorf in 1919 had dropped their enquiries with such astonishing alacrity. The fact was that they were not really in Miinchendorf on account of the herb-gatherer. They were there primarily for something quite different.In the lecture given by Dr. Steiner in Stuttgart on June 22, 1919, referring to the visit he had once paid to Felix's humble home, hehad gone on to speak of another visit he had paid. The impression given was that both took place in the same village, if not in adjoining cottages: When speaking of the visit I paid to my good friend Felix in Imlittle cottage, I had to think of how at the same time I look^ widow of the schoolmaster in her home. Although her husband haddied some years before, I visited her because this Lower AusUi^ schoolmaster was a most interesting person. His widow still had the ne library he had assembled. There one could nd all that German scholarship had collected and recorded about the German lan^apand the content of myths and legends, for the invigoration of the German people. Until his dying day the opportunity never came for this solitary schoolmaster to emerge into the limelight. It was only after his death that extracts from his literary remains werepublished. But I have still not been able to see the lengthy journals kept by this lonely schoolmaster, in which are to be found pearls of wisdom. I do not know what has become of them. Among the audience at this lecture were some of the leadersand principal speakers in the movement for the Threefold Common wealth, then in full swing. The audience also included those who were being considered for the College of T eachers in the Waldorf School, Stuttgart, prior to its foundation. Among them was the enthusiastic but temperamental Dr. Walter Johannes Stein. It will have been especially Dr. Stein who took Dr. Steiner's reference to the notebooks of the schoolmaster in Lower Austria as a request to procure these for him. After the lecture he may weU have gone up to Dr. Steiner with the words: \"We shall get hold of these journals for you, Herr Doktor.\" Dr. Steiner must have told him that the schoolmaster's name was Johannes Wurth and that his last home was Miinchendorf. It was therefore the journals of Johannes Wurth, who died in 1870 that Dr . Stein, Dr . Hamburger and Count Polzer were looking for in those weeks that followed the conference\u2014and not for Felix the herb-gatherer. They were successful. When lectures were resumed in Stuttgart, they were able to hand over to Dr . Steiner the minnrehensive four-volume journal. (The entries proved to be lessS S n S I n h a d b e e n e x p e c t e d .

S e S f \u00a3 t S r e a b o u t h i s v i s i t t o F e l i x a n d t o Johannes Wurth's house had been given on June 22, 1919. Thereference to &e chance discoveries which these friends had made of ttaces of Felix occurred in the course of the same seminar lecture in which Dr. Steiner mentioned the name, Trumau. This lecture was not given until August 26. 1919. When Dr. Stein and the others were in MUnchendorf, they must have been under the im pression that Felix's surname was Krakotzki. When Dr. Steiner mentioned Trumau, he had obviously wanted to coCTect the impression that Felix, like Johannes Wurth, had lived in Mmchendorf. For some reason or other no attention was paid to this allusion at the time. Probably the name of the village was not takien in. At any rate, it was not recorded accurately in the shorthand notes. When this allusion came to light and was clearly deciphered recently, I asked friends to see to it that the enquiries which had proved fruitless in MUnchendorf were followed up in Trumau. The rst result was that Dr. Steiner's description of the place as a quiet mountain village, and of the view away to the mountains in Ae south, seemed to suit Tnunau no better than MUnchendorf. Nor. could the name Krakotzki be traced among the lists of in habitants, though names of Czech or Polish origin were to be found there, as in MUnchendorf and throughout the surrounding countryside. I became more and more inclined to think that we were not meant to ferret out the details of Felix's life. Perhaps we had to fail in our enquiries, so that no \" revelation \" should detract from the m3dhology that had grown-up around the personality of the herb-gatherer\u2014a mythology justified by the marvellous soul qualities which he had undoubtedly possessed. The consequencewas that when I had to go to Vienna for a fortnight in the autumn of 1958, I had given up all thought of continuing my search for traces of Felix. My rst morning in Vienna was unexpectedly free. I went outto Modling for the sake of the view from those hills, and thus to renew my experience of the landscape's unique character. In front of me lay the western end of the broad Hungarian plain, known as the \" Wiener Becken\". If you wish to understand Vienna, you must get to know this country. Rudolf Steiner has coimected the fact that so many musicians lived and composed in Vienna with the character of the Wener Becken, which is a veritable geological storehouse.^ The hills above Modling belong to the \"Wiener Wald\", which stretches away to the west of the Hungarian plain, forming a northern spur of the Alps. These would be the mountains Dr. Steiner was referring to, the Hohe Wand, Schneeberg, Rax and t See the footnote to a lecture givMi by Prof. Thomastik in Dornach, Dec. 1954; Vol. No. 80Wechsel, that could be seen from Felix's home suffused in the evening light. j , T o the east, the flat Wiener Becken is bounded by the Rosahe and Leitha Mountains, which form the foothills of the range that eventually , north of the Danube, turns into the CarpatMans. The Hungarian plain between the Wiener W ald and the Leitha Moim-tains is formed by an ancient subsidence. A deep and extensive cleft must have come into existence there in Adantean or maybe even in Lemurian\u2014times. This will have been submerged, so that a kind of sea-water flooded the whole triangular area between the limestone complex of the Alps and the Carpathians and extended far into Hungary . South of where Vienna now stands, the watersdried up, giving the area its characteristic geology . Even to-day the district seems possessed of an imperishable secret that lls one with a sense of wonder. r It was misty when I stood on the hills above Modhng. Ihe outlines of the hills and mountains in the east could be sensed rather than actually seen; yet the special character of the countryside made itself felt . . ,. ,I was already on my way home when, in Traiskirchen, o^r Baden, I came across a signpost saying: \"Trumau 5 Km.\" Theidea of making this little digression attracted me, as I had never been in Trumau. That was the end of the resolution I had halfmade not to follow up any further the history of Felix the herb- g a t h e r e r . c A quite unpretentious village, lying ^ong flat green elds m this vast plain, Trumau had a strange fascination for me. I felt that I never before had I experienced the hidden secret of the Hungarian plain so distinctly.On entering the village, I was at once directed to an old farmer, named Hbrbinger , who was said to be an authority on local history . When he emerged from his low-built steading, covered from head to foot in dirt, he at once agreed that he knew a house in the village! with the inscription over Ae door: In Gottes Segen ist alles gelegen. I He thought the house had needed buttressing and was therefore completely altered. However, he let himself be bundled into theI car without any cleaning up in order to show us the house. There I was in fact nothing left of the inscription; and it turned out after- j wards that Felix had not lived there. Then the farmer had an idea:\" Old Steinhauser lives just round the comer. He is 93 and must have known the fellow you are looking for. He is practically stone ] deaf and a bit weak in the head, but there is no harm in paying him a visit.\" The old man, pitifully shrivelled and bent, was sitting over his midday meal with his family. The room was very small. I sat down next to him and shouted one or two questions into his ear. He kept asking again and agam, cupping his ear right up against my mouth: \"Hey? Hey?\" It was obvious that he could under-I 8 1stand nothing. Then suddenly a strange thing happened: the old man let his head fall right forward and, long drawn-out, as though echoing from a deep well, these words emerged: \"Aye, old Kogutzki,his name was Felix.\" Now we suddenly had a name to go on. Our friend Horbinger exclaimed in astonishment: \"Yes, old man Kogutzki's grave is in the churchyard.\" It was getting quite exciting. Back we went to the car and off to the churchyard. We could not nd the grave at once, biit then another farmer was able to help us \u2014 by now the whole village was involved \u2014 and immediately by the gate on the right, a little hidden in the corner, we found the words: \" Here lies Felix Kogutzki, died 1909 in his 76th year.\" Now we knew that Felix was born in 1833. We had certainly got on to the tracks of the herb-gatherer. A few minutes later we were sitting round the table in the inn with quite a crowd of old men. The air buzzed with jokes and anecdotes, mostly concerned, however, not with Felix but with his sons, with whom these old farmers had grown up. At the ofce of the parish council we were able (although it was not a working day) to ascertain from documents that Felix Kogutzki had ve sons, of whom one of the survivors was actually in Vienna. One thing emerged fairly soon from the old men's gossip round the table. Although it was known for a fact that Felix's principal occupation had for long been that of herbalist {Durrkrdutler), it transpired that in the course of time he had to try to earn a livingin many different ways, especially as his boys grew older. He wore out the soles of his shoes travelling as agent for various businesses: and both he and his wife took work in the factories. At weddings he accompanied the dancing on his accordion and sometimes acted as organist in the church. ' O n e o f t h e o l d m e n c a l l e d F e l i x a \" s c h o l a r \" . H e d i d n o t m e a n that Felix had had any higher education or had been to a university, but only that he was a great reader. Another recounted how they used to say, when Felix appeared: \"Here comes the chap who can see ghosts.\" Evidently this was their way of expressing what Jacob's sons used to say of their brother Joseph: \"Behold this dreamer cometh!\" In spite of the peculiar regard felt for him and the esteem in which he was held by the people of Trumau, by and large they had no feeling that there was anything very special about Felix. _ . L- Strangely enough, everybody maintained that Felix and his family did not live in a mean little cottage, but in a large well-builthouse that belonged to the \" castle \". It turned out later that Felix did in fact move in the year 1883, after the birth of four of his children, into the bigger house. On the rst floor of this house we were shown the room, admittedly not very spacious, which served for a long time as living-room and bedroom for the family of seven. In spite of these poor living conditions, Felix succeeded in startinghis sons off in steady middle-class professions. Of the two oldest, Felix Anton became a forester and Anton Felix a bookseller. Immanuel, the youngest, also became a forester, while the middle one, Gottfried, became an ofcial in the Vienna criminal courts. By now it had gone 2 o'clock, as it was nearly midday whenwe got to T rumau. I had to be in Vienna at a quarter to four , so that we had to leave these good people, with whom a very friendly understanding had grown up. As we started on our hurried journey home, there was a happy conclusion to our exciting mornings discoveries. The sun broke through the mist and all of a sudden we could see far away to the south, in very fmnt outline, me Schneeberg, with its characteristic rounded summit, as weU as the long line of the Hohe Wand. This proved to us that Dr. Sterner s description of the southern mountains, which he could ^e fromFelix's house in the evening light, did in fact apply to Trumau, despite all appearances to the contrary . The fleeting fair^uce glimpse of the distant mountains convinced me that we were here dealing with a matter of special signicance in Dr. Sterner s life. * In Vienna, on the following day , the problem was to nd Richa.rd Kogutzki, Felix's son. We nally discovered himin Floridsdorf, an out-of-the-way industrial suburb, to which he had moved just imder a year previously. The people of Trumau had always referred to him jokingly as the \"doctor of the left' {der Linken), because he had tried unsuccessfully as a young man to study law\u2014i.e., to become a \" doctor of the right\" or \" of law (der Rechte). We found a pathetic little man of 76, emaciated and bent with worry, but with bright eyes. At rst I had to support him with my arm, as he had difculty in moving about. But it was quite^ an experience to see how he livened up in the course of conversation,and nally, when I had shown him the passage about his father in Dr. Steiner's Story of My Life, he pranced about the room like a small child. His wife had died only a few weeks before and his connection with her had been, and in fact still was, a very close one. She copied pictures, and the charming manner in which she did this, and the deep feeling she brought to the task, as well as to her original landscapes, made one profoundly conscious of her presence. The walls of the room in which he lived were covered with her pictures.To begin with I simply let old Richard Kogutzki tell his own story. At rst he had difculty in nding words to express what he meant. One could see that, although his life had derived a sense of security from his father's remarkable qualities, he had never really been fully conscious of them. Probably he had never g i v e n m u c h t h o u g h t t o h i s f a t h e r ' s a s t o n i s h i n g p e r s o n a l i t y , o r t o i t s 83 82signicance. But a revelation seemed to come to him as we spoke;and it was very moving to see how the light gradually dawned. He began with: \" Well, my father was a profound philosopher of nature.\" In the end he gained condence and seemed surprised at his own words: \"He knew things that nobody else knew. He knew them . . \u2014at this he took several breaths, while searching for the right word\u2014\"he knew them . . . intuitively.\" Then some thing followed: \"He knew it as though from . . .\" Words failed him, so that I had to try and nish the sentence for him. \"As though he knew it from a previous life\", I suggested; and he called out in excitement: \" Yes, that's it, in a previous life he might have been a Brahmin!\" I hardly think that prior to this Richard had entertained the idea of repeated earthly lives, let alone spoken of it. Now to his own surprise he spoke of it as though of some thing that he had known for a long time.He recalled many things\u2014^for instance, that his father used to read much of Paracelsus and similar writers. After recounting one or two amusing incidents, another idea came to his mind-\u2014^that there was a good deal of \" the occult \" about his father. This idea brought him to tears, because it immediately led him to think of his wife, who had just died. When his sobs had died down, he told us how even now his wife often stood by his bed at night. Not long ago she kept pointing to a drawer in the cupboard that stood there; and when he looked next morning, he found wrapped up in the drawer a present intended for a small relation. She had got it ready but had not managed to send it off. He told me how he had then posted the parcel himself. This made it clear what the word\" occult\" conveyed to him. Finally^ I read to him what Dr. Steiner had written and said .about the herb-gatherer. This led to the transformation I have already mentioned. There was no holding him. He kept jumping up and repeating: \" Isn't what you have just read exactly the sameas I was ip.lliTig you? Only it is all expressed much better. That is the kind of father we had. If only we had seen it as clearly when he was still alive! We loved our father\u2014and how we enjoyed being with him! But it is only now, after all this long time, that atlast I understand everything!\" Now the dear old man was well away. He started making great plans. He wanted to go with us next day to see his relations, whohe thought would still have some documents, books, pictures and other reUcs of his father. His only thought was how he could helpme in my search. It was not until afterwards that I realised what a sacrice it was for him to interrupt the work which completelyabsorbed him, that of making model houses. He pottered ^otind with a box of aluminium bricks, out of which it was possible to make 45 different kinds of week-end bimgalows and other smallhouses. Anyone planning a house for himself was to have the ran of making a model of it down to the minutest desired detail. Hisidea was that this would one day bring him in a lot of money .He spent a sleepless night thinking over the journeys he had planned, and by the next morning had reduced these to manageable proportions. He had given up the idea of ttaveUing south to nearA s p a n g , w h e r e h i s y o u n g e s t b r o t h e r w a s s U l l a l i v e , b u t s e n o u s l y i l land incapable of making conversation.

The citing of his name in these instances only indicates that the use of ancient popular remedies in this form for the purpose 84of healing is reckoned to belong to the same tradition as that which Albertus Magnus followed. iMide the books were scraps of paper with proverbs scrawled on them, evidently used by Felix in his \"consultations\" when attending sick animals and maybe also human patients. It seemsthat from time to time he undertook work of this kind. People would turn to him when their animals were sick. When his advice was asked on health matters, he tried to help with herbs and ointments. The most precious nd was a tattered old notebook, in which me herb-gatherer had kept his diary from March, 1876, until February, 1884. The entries were written in a clumsy peasanthand. It was touching to read with what circumstantial detail life's little happenings were recorded. There is no expression of thoughts and inner experiences of the soul: everything is simple and straight forward fact. Each entry is signed, as though it were an important document, by Felix together with his full titles: \"Felix Kogutzki, certicated herbalist, agent, etc.\" At the end of the book every entry is indexed under its appropriate heading. The diary begins with a prayer: Praised and blessed be the most holy sacrament of the altar, for ever and ever. Amen ! Monday 20th March A.D. 1876, I made enquiries at the universityof the city of Vienna about the names of the professors of botany. Tuesday 21st d.M.uJ. (i.e. same month and year) I bought a ^ B l a c k F o r e s t c l o c k . V ' Monday 27th d.M.u.J. I introduced myself to Herr Frenzl, curatorof the Vienna botanical museum. A day or two ago I bought a botanical magnifying glass. Tuesday 4th. I bought an ordinary saw. After this Felix refers to the professor of botany, who has set him an examination. We then read: Friday 23rd June. I was awarded my Concession ad Negotiant in plantis medicinis. In the index entry No. 9 above is entitled: \"Herbalist's licence\" (Durrkrdutler Concession). The diary begins, then, at the time that Felix is trying to make a regular profession of herb-gathering. He starts getting himself established in Trumau, buys furniture and even puts a business name-plate over the door of his house. A few months later he marries. His wife, Johanna Neumeier, was eighteen years younger than himself and came from the Bohemian Forest. She died in 1920. One by one the events are recorded which constitute the life of this humble family. 1877, 1879, 1881, 1883 and 1886 are the years in which the sons were born. In 1883 the family moved into the house by the castle. It soon became necessary to take onother work besides herb-gathering in order to make ends meet. When I held this precious diary with its yellowing pages in my hands, I was quick to turn up the most important entry of all: No. 41. Herr Steiner jun., Studiosus, of Inzersdorf, visited me Sunday 21st August A.D. 1881; unfortunately I w^ outNo. 42. H. St. paid me a second visit Fnday 26th. d.M.u.J. This, then, was the visit of which Rudolf Steiner spoke. At that time they must have known each other for nearly two years\u2014 their friendship being constantly renewed in the course of their j o u r n e y s t o g e t h e r t o V i e n n a . .The Kirchberg headmaster also let me have two pictures of Felix as an old man. They show him with his wife, his children and grandchildren. In the evening, when we got back from our journey, the widow of the middle son, Gottfried Kogut^i, wholived in Vienna, showed us a large picture of the family . ^^e sons, then grown up, were standing behind the parents. The d^ewas 1906\u2014three years before Felix's death. It is difficult to descnbeFelix's face. In spite of its simplicity , it has noble features. One could take him for a parson\u2014^for one who has devoted a long life to the service of his fellow men. There is a look about his face as though of transguration. . , ,, uOn the way home from Kirchberg old Richard kept remember ing further incidents in his father's life. As we were able to makethe detour through T rumau, we had a useful chance to complete the picture we had already formed there. After we had put flowers on Felix's grave, Richard showed us the place where the cottap used to stand. It was where his father rst lived and where he himself was bom. After that we sat down in the inn again with the old men, who had meanwhile remembered a number of other things from the old times. ^ Felix Kogutzki was bom in Vienna on August 1st, 1833. His mother , Barbara, was unmarried. She was the daughter of a Polish cavalry captain, Michael Kogutzki, who was with the troops thatfought in 1831 to free Poland from the Russians, but were defeated. Thev were forced into Austrian territory , where they were disarmed.Vienna was at that time full of impoverished Polish ofcers and cnldiers Captain Kogutzki's daughter was therefore compelled to S i n t o ' d o m e s t i c s e r v i c e w i t h a f a m i l y i n T r a t t n ^ e r h o f , n e a r S t .I f ^ - n h e n ' s C a t h e d r a l .

Felix was then apprenticed to a baker . Once, when Croatian soldiers were passing through, he was ^ven an enormous basket of rolls and told to offer them to the soldiers for sale. He soon got rid of the rolls but brought no money back, for which he was soundly thrashed by his master. Many such tales were told, which showed increasingly clearly what a harsh upbringing Felix must have had, until he succeeded in establishing himself in Trumau and. earning a modest living. One entry in Felix's diary reveals how strictly he used to dis cipline himself: Use and arrangement of time with respect to getting up in the morning, if required by duty or pressure of work. During May, June and July 3 a.m., August and September 3.45, October 4 a.m., Novem ber 4.45, December and January 5 a.m., February 4.30, March 4 a.m., Md nally April 3.45. Besides arranging my times in this way, my time for getting up is subject to another condition. When there is no great urgency, I shall still get up as sooii as I hear the Ave Maria, in whatever place or country I may be. Trumau, Friday 30th June A.D. 1882, F.K. When we read this, we should bear in mind what tremendous distances Felix had to cover on foot. Whether he went east to the Leitha Mountains or west to the foothills of the Vienna Woods to collect herbs, he had a good three hours' walking. Several times every day distances like that from Trumau to Miinchendorf, which takes an hour, had to be covered. Many anecdotes reveal the demands made on the herb-gatherer by neighbours in all spheres of life and activity. With the beginningof the Socialist movement, which had Felix's sympathy, he was once fetched to address a popular meeting in place of the intended speaker\", who had failed to turn up. His speech was enthusiastically received. But there was some embarrassment afterwards, when he closed the meeting with three cheers for the Emperor Franz Joseph. The following incident reveals how he was regarded by the other inhabitants of Trumau. Once, when Felix was hard up, he had to borrow a considerable sum from a well-to-do neighbour, the village innkeeper and baker. As security, he handed over his gold watch. By the time carnival came round, not much had been paid back,but the publican sent word to Felix that one of the boys should come round to fetch their pancakes. One of the pancakes in the basket was much bigger and heavier than the rest and was found, on being opened, to contain the watch. . On the journey home from Kirchberg, Richard had much to tellof the family atmosphere in which he had grown up. The father was very devout: grace was said before meals and prayers before going to bed. At Christmas, the initials of the Three Kings were 1 An-ancient grammar school run by Benedictine monks.hung over the door\u2014M B. There was much music-making athome: and when Felix sang, his voice would resound through the village. This is a suitable place to. insert a quotation from a letter writtento me by Richard Kogut^i: \"Y ou have already been told at Trumau Aat at weddings he would play the accordion, accompanied on the violin by his third son Gottfried, once he had reached his fourteenth year. To this music Father would sing songs gay and grave. His ne baritone voice had exceptional power. All ve boys were very talented musically and had good voices, so that music and song were a featiure of our family life. Between us we played with success the violin, the ^itar, zither, French horn, bugleand piano. A scene comes to mind of a warm spring evening, when we were singing a solemn chorale by the open window of our rst- floor flat next to the castle. Father was accompanying us on his tuneful three-manual accordion. Passers-by stood and looked on approvingly , clapping loudly at the end of the song.\"The children's upbringing was strict, but always with positive intention. The cane was used, but really only as a symbol.\" Our parents brought us up in a spirit of freedom, always anxious to make us self-reliant\u2014and after all we have not grown up a bad lot.\" Once, for a short time, Felix looked after a girl who was sickly and suffered from depression, because she had been con stantly scolded and beaten by her parents. Felix had, as his son points out, a good way of building up conscious self-reliance in children; and after a few weeks the girl was able to go back home, well and happy . \"Y es, the most that scolding teaches children is how to scold.\" One can well imagine that wherever Felix peddled his wares from house to house, perhaps sometimes even in Baden or as far aeld as Vienna, he took with him at the same time a warm and friendly human feeling. The herb-gatherer lived on until 1909. All outward contact between him and Rudolf Steiner seems to have ended long before then. But it is surely no coincidence that .soon after Felix had left the physical plane, Rudolf Steiner started work on his rst Mystery Play, The Portal of Initiation, in which Fedix appeared, rst as the \"Man with the Lamp\" and then as Felix Balde. The play was performed for the rst time in 1910, in Munich. The character who had played such an important part in Rudolf Steiner's life was then seen for the rst time on the stage. In this way the herb- gatherer came to life again. The mythical aura surrounding FelixBalde was no mere trimming: it indicated that part of the man from Trumau which lay outside his own consciousness, for he was a greater man than he himself knew. * There is an important sense in which Felix's essential nature is parallelled by the countryside around Trumau. The district in 88 89which he lived was as unpretentious as the man himself, but, like his plain exterior features, it concealed inner forces and a rich soul life. We are here touching on the puzzling question of how Rudolf Steiner came to describe Trumau as a \" solitary mountain villageThere is no suggestion of mountainous country about the village itself. Wide treeless plains extend in all directions. But the word Gebirge has, in addition to its usual meaning, a rather special sensein that district, especially on the western fringe of the Hungarian plain. So, for instance, the name of the place to which Rudolf Steiner's parents moved with him and the rest of the family, after three yearsin Inzersdorf, was Brunn am Gebirge (\"mountain spring\"). This place is north of Modling and barely touches the foothills of the Vienna Woods. The use of the word Gebirge in this instance is clearly a reference to a mountain atmosphere rather than to the actual presence of hills and valleys. In some sense this seems to apply also to the triangle of land formed by the western end of the Hungarian plain that lies south of the Danube. In prehistoric times there was a landslide, but the mountains which were there before that event have left behind something of their inner character, so that the word Gebirge is tobe found in the plain itself, as well as in the hills fringing it to east and west. The wide plain, in which much of Vienna is spread out, is Gebirge because within itself mountains lie submerged. The present-day language still reveals this sense of a mountainous district. In this connection let us go back to the deep impression made on Rudolf Steiner as a young man, when he saw the distant moun tains tinged gold by the setting sun, as he looked away to the south from Felix's cottage. This view of the Schneeberg and the other mountains of northern Styria is not normally seen from Trumau, but only on particular occasions. They then appear as though a curtain had been drawn aside somewhat to reveal the hidden secret of this whole countryside. This had quite a special signicance for Rudolf Steiner. The view he had that evening in Trumau of the mountains seemed to sum up his entire previous relationship with the country. These mountains were home to him, as nothing else was. When Rudolf Steiner reached the age at which a child becomes fully conscious of the outside world, his father was stationmasterat Pottschach, which lies immediately at the foot of this range of mountains. The shapes of the Schneeberg, Rax and Wechsel, where they go down to the Semmering, were deeply imprinted on his soulas a child. It was as though the guardian spirits of his home watched over his young life from the peaks of these mountains. He describes this himself in the Story of My Life: My childhood was spent in the most glorious country surround ings. One could see the mountains which join Lower Austria toStyria \u2014the Schneeberg, Wechsel, Rax and Semmering. The bare rocky summit of the Schneeberg would catch the rays of the morningsun. This was our rst greeting from a ne summer's day. In striking contrast was the severe grey ridge of the Wechsel. Themountains seemed to rise up, as though growing out of the friendly countryside, which is everywhere a smiling green. Close at hand were the intimate beauties of nature, while the splendour of the mountain tops dominated the distant horizon. Later on, Rudolf Steiner's father was shifted to Neudorfl. This lies considerably further north, on the eastern fringe of the \" Wiener Becken\", where the Leitha Mountains form the frontier between Austria and Hungary. It was then that the young lad started at the Realschule in Wiener Neustadt, making the journey from Neudorfl every day. There is a splendid distant prospect of these same moun tains to be seen from Wiener Neustadt, and also from Neudorfl. This time the view covers the entire range. As a schoolboy, there fore, Rudolf Steiner had the exj^rience of constantly seeing the most magnicent aspect of his childhood surroundings afresh: The Alps, which could be seen close at hand in Pottschach, were now only visible in the distance. But they were a constant reminder of the past, standing in the background, as one looked at the lower ranges which could be reached in a short time from our new home. Inzersdorf, where Rudolf Steiner was living when he began his studies in Vienna, lies so far north that from there he could no longer see the mountains that spoke to him of home. But in August, 1881, when at the age of 20 he visited the herb-gatherer Felix in Tnunau, he was perhaps in the most northerly spot from which, given the right conditions, it is possible to catch momentary glimpses of these mountains. Seeing the mountain-tops he loved, as he was saying good-bye, was like a reunion with the very heart of his home. It allayed the homesickness that persisted in his soul. The mountains spoke the same language, sang to him as it were in the same key, as Felix. His heart responded to the soul of the earth, which had now released him for work in the big city. In making this transition, he had had Felix as his guide. The world of modem civilisation, into which Rudolf Steiner was thrust when he left the country, was also to be the scene of a pro found awakening. In this process of development, he was to be the pioneer of a new spiritual era for mankind. It is signicant that here, too, Felix was to play the part of an intermediary and guide! In a sense my friend Felix was simply the forerunner of another personality, who had the task of stimulating something in the soul ofthis youth, standing as he was in the midst of the spiritual world. He drew attention to the need for regular systematic exercises, which are essential in the spiritual world. ... As far as his everyday work went, this distinguished man was as insignicant as Felix himself. (4th February, 1913).Edouard Schure wrote as follows about this personality, on the strength of information given him by Rudolf Steiner in conversa tion: The teacher (Meister) whom Rudolf Steiner found was one of those mighty person^ties who full their mission, unknown to the worldand in the guise of some quite conventional work which they take on . . (from the Preface to the French edition of Christianity as Mystical Fact). This teacher led the young Steiner by way of Fichte's writings to that vigorous development of the power of thought which culminates in a decisive awakening of the soul. In contrast to Felix, he must have been an exceptionally forceful and active character. In the modem equivalent of the \"ght with the dragon \", it was he who was Rudolf Steiner's teacher {Lehrmeister): How was he to tame the dragon of modem science and harness him to the vehicle of Spiritual Science? . . . How was he to overcome the monster (Stier) of public opinion? To this question the unknown Master answers: You will not conquer the dragon until you get inside his skin. As for the monster, you must take him by the horns. I have shown youwho you are. Now go and be yourself. In Goethe's fairy-tale, the decisive moment occurs when the snake whispers the missing fourth secret to the Old Man with the Lamp. At this the old man becomes the herald of a new age:\" The time has come!\" he caUs in a resounding voice. This must have been the way in which Rudolf Steiner experienced his meeting with Felix. It was through him that he heard the call, \"The time has come!\" After that he was equipped and ready for all that might follow. The call appears in the following words spoken by Felix Balde in the second Mystery Play: Obediently I followed the spirit's leading. Its voice in my heart. When it enjoined me to be silent. And now, when it calls on me to speak, I will again obey. The being of man changes In the course of the earth's becoming. We are at a turning-point in time. A portion of spiritual knowledge Must be disclosed to all men Whose minds are open to receive it. Translated by John Naumann.In Memoriam: Emil Bock Alfred Heidenreich E M E L b o c k , f o r 2 1 y e a r s t h e s u p r e m e h e a d o f t h e C h r i s t i a nCommunity and an Anthroposophist of world, stature, was an unusual personality. He came from German working-class stock. His sheer physical vitality and his immense personal authority marked him out as a leader of men. He reminded me at times of Ernest Bevin. When he was arrested by the Gestapo and imprisoned for nine months in a concentration camp, he succeeded by sheer force of personality in prevailing upon his jailors to keep him in the com paratively lenient camp at Wekhausen and not to transfer him to Dachau or Buchenwald. He also managed, by virtue of his wonderful vitality and will-power, to use some of the nights in camp to write his memoirs, which have now become available after his death. They tell us a great deal about his childhood and youth which we did not know before. They are at the moment being serialised in the German magazine of the Christian Community, Die Christengemeinschaft, and also in a partly abridged form in\" The Christian Community \". The chapters which have appeared so far give us a picture of the stark poverty of his home. Already as a boy of four, he was forced to help with his father's trade, learning how to sew carpets together. A generous employer who recognised the exceptional gifts of the boy paid for his higher education, but this came to an abrupt end with die outbreak of war in July, 1914.With the barest minimum of military training, Enul Bock and other fellow students were sent to the Western Front in October, 1914. In the last days of that month, destiny intervened. Bock was dangerously wounded. A shell splinter hit him in the back, pierced one kidney and came to rest in the intestines. Afterwards he could not fully recollect the date or the length of time during which he was left as dead on the battleeld. But when he came to, days later in a eld hospital, he found the senior surgeon standingby his bed, shaking his head. \"My dear fellow,\" he said, \"you have had a d . . . piece of luck. If you hadn't been starved before that attack, if your insides hadn't been so b . . . empty, you wouldn't ^ alive.\" Bock describes in his memoirs how from that moment he felthimself a different personality . Up to that time, together with great intellectual gifts, he had been a dreamy boy. Now he woke up, and took possession of his body and his physical senses. He was then nineteen years of age. * 92 93As a result of a series of peculiar circumstances and because of his severe wounds. Bock was posted after his recovery to an ofce job in the newly created department of censorship in Berlin. Among the mail which came one day for inspection to his department were parcels from the \" Philosophical-Anthroposophical Publishing Co.\" in Berlin. Bock's interest in these publicationsbegan quickly to transcend the boundaries of military censorship.He broke the rules and took some of these books home overnight in order to study them seriously. Thus began Bock's life-long contact with Rudolf Steiner and his works\u2014although for the time being other interests still took precedence. His ofcial duties left him sufcient time and energy to enrol as a student at Berlin University. He read history and languages, but after a while he changed to Theology, in response to some inner promptings which he failed to reason out to himself at the time.He soon became senior student of his faculty, and in 1917, when the fth centenary of the Reformation was celebrated. Bock, although technically still in the Army, marched in the procession in full-dress students' uniform at the side of the banner of his Students' Union. A faded photograph of this historic moment has recently come to light; it shows as the actual standard bearer Dr. Eberhard Kurras, Emil Bock's closest life-long friend and a co- founder of the Christian Community. During 1917 Bock also visited a number of churches in Berlin,\" sermon-tasting \". One Sunday he found himself in the crowded church of Dr. Rittelmeyer, who had been appointed to Berlin a short time before. Bock did not fail to recognise the difference. After the Service he called at the vestry, together with his friend Kurras. When Rittelmeyer welcomed both with open arms, the angels of destiny who planned a new Age of Christianity musthave looked down with intense interest. Rittelmeyer introduced both friends to Rudolf Steiner, who admitted them at once to all his meetings and lectures. Before long Bock became the centre of a group of students in Berlin who recognised in Anthroposophy the new wisdom of the age. * I met Bock rst in September, 1921, when, during an Anthro posophical Congress in Stuttgart, the would-be founders of theChristian Community held several meetings among themselves. Although Bock had at rst not been among those young Anthro- posophists who asked Rudolf Steiner whether they should carry Anthroposophy into the renewal of Christian life and practice, hesoon dominated the group. I confess that his manner nearly put me off for good at the time, and it needed many a erce battle before we could work peacefully together. But when we all moved to Dornach after the Stuttgart Congress, Bock became the recog nised speaker who formulated questions and discussed the day-to-3 I rating page 94 94day business with Rudolf Steiner during the training course whichRudolf Steiner then held for the founders of the Christian Com munity.A year later , in September , 1922, the Christian Community was actuaUy founded in Dornach. On the advice of Rudolf Steiner a seven ofce-holders was appointed, with Bock as one ofthe leading gures. Two years later he was designated, at the express suggestion of Rudolf Steiner, as Dr. Friedrich Rittelmeyer'ssuccessor in the supreme leadership. After Rittelmeyer's death in March, 1938, Bock took oyer. One of his early acts as Erz-Oberlenker was to conduct an Ordina- tton Service in London in the spring of 1939. The twenty-one years dunng which Bock held the ofce of Erz-Oberlenker in the Christian Community were stormy and difcult. The Nazi poison crept intothe souls of even decent men and women, and the Hitler Govern ment increasingly restricted the activities of the Christian Com munity on the Continent until, in June, 1941, it suppressed them completely. During this time, in August, 1939, Emil Bock lost alsohis beloved wife, mother of the son and three daughters who survive him. When the Hitler regime at long last collapsed. Bock threwmmself with furious energy into the rebuilding of the Movement in Germany. He commandeered single-handed a large club-house in Stuttgart, and with his imperious manner made the French andAmerican occupation authorities recognise the house ofcially as a plaw of worship. He managed to persuade a couple of lorry driversto help him in getting back his library , which the Nazis had looted and the greater part of which they had incorporated into the \"Aryan Institute \" of the University of Tubingen. As soon as circumstances permitted. Bock renewed also his contacts with the Steiner world outside Germany . In the summer 1947 he came to England, and in addition to his work for the Christian Community, he visited a number of anthroposophical ^titutions, Michael Hall and Wynstones schools, Camphill andClent and addressed anthroposophical audiences. In those difcult years. Bock was an ideal leader. His ghting spirit and great moral courage won him much recognition also beyond the borders of the Christian Communis and the Anthro posophical Society. It was under his leadership that the public authorities in Germany accorded to the Christian Conmunity the stati^ of Kdrperschaft Offentlichen Rechts \u2014 so placing it On a ^tmg of legal equsdity with the Lutheran and Roman CatholicChwehes. Bock was also on terms of personal acquaintanceship witn President Heuss and members of the Federal German Govern ment. He W as an accomplished letter-writer and kept up a large correspondence with celebrities of science, music, literature and the Stage, m Germany and abroad. It must be admitted, however, that in a measure Bock had also 95 OB\u2014?some of the defects of his virtues. It was almost second nature to him to have the last word in discussion and to have his way with whatever he proposed. Working in committee, with anything approaching normal democratic procedure, was nearly unbearableto him. He became very quickly restless and almost physically breathless. In this respect he had not a little of the Bismarckian German left in him, ideal in times of distress and danger, but perhaps not equally ideal in times of quiet growth and peaceful evolution. * Apart from his war-time leadership, I believe Bock will be most remembered for his theological works, and for his intimate historic research into the life and background of Rudolf Steiner. In these activities he was engaged with his heart. The eight volumes of his Beitrage zur Geistesgeschichte der Menschheit are a detailed application of Rudolf Steiner's method to the study of the Old andNew Testament and their vast historic background; in scope, com prehensiveness and brilliant detail they will not easily be matched. Two of thrae volumes, \" The Three Years \" and \"Apocalypse \" have appeared in English. Two more volumes, \" Caesars and Apostles \" and \"Childhood and Youth of Jesxis\", are in preparation by the Christian Community Press. These last two, together with \"The Three Years\", form Bock's \"Life of Jesus\". Other major works include a series of biographies of German forerunners of anthro- posophical thought, of witnesses in German literature to the fact of reincarnation, and a comprehensive volume on Romanesque (\" Norman \") buildings in Wiirttemberg. Into these writings the fruits of his wide reading, extending to rare and obscure books, are incorporated, and his uncanny instinct for historic reality led him to many original re-interpretations of traditional views. To travel with him, as I did on occasion, and to visit, for instance, an historic town, was an amazing experience. With an unfailing sixth sense, he would be off on the trail, and before long we woidd have seen not only the usual sights but a wealth of interesting architectural and cultural curiosities which no guide-book had listed. Most impressive must have been his familiarity with the Holy Land. Friends who travelled with him to Palestine felt that he moved about Jerusalem as if he could recall the old city of Christ's time from rst-hand memory. I believe he really solved several archaeological riddles, connected for example with the palace ofPilate or with the \"Upper Room\", but like H. V. Morton, for whom he had a high regard. Bock was too much of an independent free-lance scholar to be given attention by the nairow and jealous circle of professional archaeologists. But he did impress some of the ofcial guides and \" couriers \" in Jerusalem. Among the tributes sent at his death was a moving letter from one of these guides, whowrote that he never fails to tell his parties that\" the German scholar Bock\" had known and taught facts about the Essenes and their settlements years before his ndings were conrmed by the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls. * The same uncanny instinct for unearthing historical material and for discovering new facts and new angles of vision was applied by Emil Bock also to his biographical researches into the life and work of Rudolf Steiner. It is no exaggeration to say that the most important and most treasured acquisitions which have been added since Dr. Steiner's death to the Rudolf Steiner Archives in Domach were discovered by Emil Bock. The way in which he traced the correspondence of Rudolf Steiner with his rst publisher is a trueadventure story (which cannot be told at the moment). Earlier on. Bock found and acquired Rudolf Steiner's correspondence with the German philosopher Eduard von Hartmann, about whom Rudolf Steiner writes at some length in his autobiography. A little later, some of the correspondence with members of the circle around Nietzsche was brought to light. Bock pursued the smallest indication with unagging persever ance. Persistently, for years, he entered into contact with every personality, or their descendants, mentioned by Steiner in his auto biography or otherwise known to have been connected with Steiner. Much of the information collected in this manner has been embodied in the comprehensive biography of Rudolf Steiner which was the last work in which Emil Bock was engaged ^d which he had nearly nished when death overtook him. Its publication is to be expected some time in 1961 and will be a tting contribution to the Rudolf Steiner Centenary. Bock's last discovery in this eld was concerned with me per sonality and circumstances of the \"herb-gatherer\", Felix, whomade such an important impression on the young Steiner. In the forthcoming book the chapter dealing with the \"herb-gatherer\" will be based on Bock's last lectmre to the Anthroposophical Society in Stuttgart (of which an English translation appears in the present issue of the Golden Blade). When Bock came home from such a voyage of discovery and brought out his new treasures for the inspection of one or twointimate friends, he was humanly at his most charming. On such occasions he could be the most delightful host. There was a scarcely controlled glint in his eyes when he recounted\u2014quite casually as it were\u2014his latest amazing finds. The great and charm ing boy, who survived in him to the end, hidden behind the weighty personality, looked out of him at such moments. At such moments, too, the basic humility became visible which was an abiding and genuine part of his being, below and behind his often lordly ways. * %97At the end of November, 1955, Emil Bock and I were at Dornach for one of the periodical visits of the Oberlenkerschaft of the Christian Community to the Vorstand of the Goetheanum. We went for a stroll in the evening under the full moon, which later that night was to undergo a total eclipse. The atmosphere was close and foreboding. The next morning Bock had a temperature. But having been used all his life to ride rough-shod over any physical ailment, he ignored the danger-sign. During the following night a complete breakdown of all the functions occurred. At 3.30 a.m. the doctor had to be called; he immediately ordered an ambulance to transfer the patient to the Anthroposophical Clinic at Arlesheim. Bock recovered from this breakdown, but he was physically no longer the same. True to his temperament, he tried to disregardthe limitations of health, only to provoke another serious break down. Now also some after-effects of his war-time injuries showed themselves. Some nerves had been damaged and his feet were frozen at the time; and now the feet became swollen and painfully inflamed at the slightest overstrain. It was very distressing to see this giant dragging himself to the pulpit or rostrum in specially tted slippers. But his spiritual and mental faculties remained unimpaired and rose triumphantly above the increasing limitationsof the breaking physical frame. The end came on December 6, 1959, the second Sunday in Advent, at 10 a.m., when close by in the big church of die Christian Community at Stuttgart the celebration of the Act of Consecration of Man was beginning. Under the hands of Dr. Rudolf Frieling, his appointed successor, who administered the Last Anointing, F .mil Bock passed through the Gate of Death. Kmil Bock was bom\u2014duriujg Ascension-tide\u2014on May 19.1895. This was a prophetic date for hun who was to be one of tihe leading heralds of the ascended cosmic Christ in this century. It was equally signicant that he should have died on an Advent Sunday,when the Gospel appointed (by Rudolf Steiner) to be read pro claimed the coming of the Etheric Christ Whom he hoped to meet.Equity Between Man and Man Owen Bareld This article rst appeared in the Midsummer 1932 issue of the quarterly, Anthroposophyt now long out of print. It must beread in the light of the period of its origin\u2014the great economic slump of the ** thirties \"\u2014but it is still relevant in many r^pectsto the present time. We are reprinting it in the belief that to many readers of the Golden Blade it is probably unkno^. Thetext has been slightly revised by the author, who also added a postscript on the economic climate of to-day.\u2014The Ediiora. CTUDENTS of Rudolf Steiner's World Economy are not likelyto forget the difcult lecture in which he attributes many of the morbid symptoms displayed by the economic life of the world to-day to the tendency of capital to accumulate in the form of land-values. He speaks of the way in which the economic process of the production and consumption of commodities subsists between two poles: Nature and Spirit. In the rst place human labour operates upon Nature (that is, essentially , on land); in the second place the creating and organising spirit works upon human labour ,\" saving \" it and making it more and more productive; and in this way the thing which we call capital is built up.Steiner goes on to point out how it is not merely morally but also economically necessary that\u2014as a third stage\u2014^the capital so accumulated should be placed at the service of the spirit and thus allowed indirectly (that is via its disbursement on educative andother spiritual activities) to flow back into the land and into further production. Instead of this the spirit is omitted, and as a result huge masses of capital, vainly attempting to complete the circuitand return to the land, but without dissipating themselves, pile up in mortgages and land-values and produce a terrible congestion. The whole course makes us more sensible of the true nature of capital. Most people to-day suffer from the incorrigible illusion that capital is \"wealth\"\u2014-an illusion easily explained by the fact that the individual who is placed in control of some capital may, in a civilised state of society, very conveniently change it into wealth at any moment. This does not, however, make it wealth, any more than the fact that a salesman earns his family's bread and butter by his labours makes salesmanship a productive activity. Capital is rather (to use an electrical metaphor) a \" difference of potential.\" It is a state of disequilibrium, of unequal pressure, and,as such, is the pre-requisite of all economic activity. If the economic process were complete, these pressures, after doing their work,would discharge to earth again, that is to the land. But the con ductor is wanting. Instead, therefore, they pile up above the earth, over it. ITiis creates a static charge of steadily increasing intensity; 98and a static charge is, for the people living in it, the atmosphere before a thimderstorm. * H we ask, what is the practical arrangement which makes possible the accumulation of capital, which makes possible its con version into personal wealth and, above all, its congestion in the form of land-values and upon the security of land, the answer is short and simple. It is the fact that there is a law of property. It is the fact that men have certain rights as against each other, rights which the law guarantees and will if necessary enforce. The history of the law of property is the history of these rights. Andone of the rst things which the study of this history teaches us is the fact that these rights tend to vary widely with the different kinds of property concerned. What are these different kinds of property? The basic dis tinction is, of course, the distinction between land on the one side and aU other kinds of property on the other. English law calls these two classes Real Property and Personal Property, and there is possibly no better illustration of the typical differences, and of the typical relation, between the varying rights to which they may give rise, than the English law of property. At any rate, an historical view of this part of the law illuminates this relation in a peculiarly interesting way.To imderstand the law of real property, it is necessary to be able to think with a certain amount of sympathy of the feudal system. In a feudal society, we have, to begin with, a social organism in which the land is everything and the human being (except possibly for a few exalted nobles) is attached to it almost after the fashion of a vegetable. If he is a serf, he is adscriptus glebce\u2014\" annexed to the soil\"\u2014and is not allowed to leave the place of his birth. The notion that the word ' law' involves a separate, abstract system of personal rights, rights independent of topography and attaching equally to aU men simply because they are men, is as yet hardlyexistent. The very rights themselves spring, as it were, from the soil. TTius, just as to-day land may be sold with certain rights (of drainage, light, etc.) over adjacent land attaching to it, so in thetime of the feudal tenures rights of quite a different kind would pass with a given piece of land\u2014^rights which we cannot think ofas concerning the land, as such, at all, rights and obligations of a personal kind; some of them of a very personal kind indeed. It was only gradually that there rst emerged from this older conception of \"real\" property, and afterwards grew up side byside with it, steadily increasing in relative importance, that very different conception of \"personal\" property, which covers the sort of property tW is easily transferable by simple delivery and in which (as far as the law is concerned) any man may acquire a good right, irrespective of his status or the place of his birth, by paying 100the price which its owner demands for it. The distinction betweenr e a l p r o p e r t y a n d p e r s o n a l p r o p e r t y i s , h o w e v e r , n o t q u i t e a s s i m ^ eas it is apt to appear on the face of it. One is tempted by the terms themselves to think of land as having been called because it is nice and solid and immovable, while \"personal\" property would be the kind of property (cash and so forth) whichcan be carried on the person. But this is not really the meaning of the terms. They arise, as has been pointed out, from the fact that the right involved in the ownership of real property was of a different kind from the right involved in the ownership of other k i n d s o f p r o p e r t y . . . o u It is necessary to explain this difference. What is a right? How is its nature dened and determined? The lawyer answers mis question by asking another. If my client's right is infringed, whatsort of action can I bring, and against whom? It is in the answerto this question that the origin of the difference between real and personal property is to be found. The owner's right to his landwas a right which he could enforce against the whole world. It wasa right in rem\u2014to the thing itself\u2014so that if he were disposses^d, he could bring an action for the recovery of the thing itself. But the law at rst recognised no such right in the case of personal property . He who was deprived of this could not, at law, enforceits return. His sole remedy was an action for damages against me particular person who had wronged him. Such an action was called a'personal'action. .For similar reasons a distinction arose between two dittereiu kinds of personal property . Just as there is jeal property and personal property , so personal property iteelf maj^onsirt either of\" things-in-possession\" or \" things-in-action. The difference is again a question of rights. If I see my watch lying on your table,I am entitled to pick it up and carry it away without your per mission. But the fact that you owe me ten pounds does not entitle me to remove from your table ten pound notes or a bearer cheque for \u00a310. In order to recover \"my\" \u00a310 against your will, I must bring an action. . . j-These rights to acquire property by bringmg an acUon, as dis tinct from property itself, are called things\u2014or (not to shirk the Norman French)\u2014' choses-in-action.' My watch, on the other hand (quite apart from the question whether it k actually at the moment in its true owner's possession or not) is classied as a chose-in-possession. Thus, choses-in-possession are concrete, ascer tained chattels; choses-in-action are, in essence, rights enabling me to obtain something if I choose. These rights may be^ contingent only, for there may be nothing to be got. The copyright of thisarticle is a chose-in-action and, as such, forms part of the writer's personal property . So are the shares in a limited company . Thus,though choses-in-action are only 'rights' to property , they are also a form of property itself. They may be bought and sold, and a 101large part of the buying and selling that goes on in the world to-day is concerned with them. We can now amplify a little the original distinction between real property and personal property . We have instead three categories: 1 . R e a l p r o p e r t y ( l a n d ) 2. Choses-in-possession ) 3. Choses-in-action / (personal property) It is obvious that choses-in-action lie at the opposite pole to realty . On the one hand, the actual possession and enjoyment of something ascertained is guaranteed and maintained by the law; on the other hand, it is only a right to possess something unascertained which is supported. The gradual recognition of this often not very clearly dened right to possess is, in this country, closely bound up with the historyof Equity. What is Equity? How has it come about that this academic name for a universal principle of justice or equality is now used in such peculiarly technical ways, so that, for instance, a man who has signed a contract to purchase a house is said to \" have the equity \" in it, and the ordinary shares of the most bogus and disreputable limited company that can possibly be imagined are properly called \" equity shares \" ?In the same course of lectures by Dr. Steiner {World Economy) there is at one point a very curious sentence. The lecturer is speaking of loans. He begins to illustrate his thesis. \"A lendsB money,\" he says (or words to that effect) and then he adds: \"There you have a relation between two persons.\" TTie remark seems so unnecessary that for that very reason it pulls up the reader. In any other writer one would not think twice about it, but the more experienced one becomes in the study of Anthroposophy, the more one is inclined to adopt towards Steiner's words the attitude which scientists adopt towards nature. That is to say, one assumes an underlying principle of uniformity in the light of which nothing is meaningless, if one could only leam to understand it. The history of Equity ( I mean in English jxirisprudence, where die development has been quite peculiar) is precisely the history of the recognition of this relation between two persons by the Courts. Equity begins as soon as the \"relation between two persons beginsto be recognised as a thing, as an object no less 'real', in fact though not in name, than a piece of land. * It is too commonly assumed that the subjection of the processes of litigation to a hide-bound formalism is a disease of civilisation from which primitive societies were immune. This is far from the truth;- at any rate, it is far from the truth in the case of those peoples among whose customs we must look for the origin of the English common law. One has only to read one of the Icelandic 102Sagas to realise two things: rst, that a Viking was obliged to givea far greater portion of his time and attention to the business of conducting lawsuits than, let us say, a member of the stock- exchange; secondly, that the operation of law, even at its most primitive stage, when nearly every dispute ended in personal combat, was bound hand and foot by the necessity for correctness of form. Everything depended on using the correct words in your summons. A right was enforceable only if there happened to be some established form of action (and there were none too many) which would t the particular infringement of which you had to complain. If not, no matter how unjustiy you had been treated,the courts could do nothing for you. \" Where there is a remedy,\" ran the old maxim, \" there is a right\" Whereas it is quite instinctive with us to reverse the order and say: \" Where there is a right, there m u s t b e r e m e d y . \" r ? i j This cramping limitation of the right of action lasted in England well into the thirteenth century, and the remedy, when it came, took a rather curious form. People who had a genuine grievance for which, owing to formal reasons, no relief was available at law,turned to the King as the ultimate fountain of justice;^ and the person who had to deal with their petitions was the King's highest ofcial, the Chancellor. Down to the Reformation this ofcial was invariably an ecclesiastic, and he was known among other titles, asthe \"Keeper of the King's Conscience.\" The way in which the Christian Church had taken into itself and metamorphosed certain conceptions developed by the Roman lawyers is beyond the scopeof this article. Here we have only to notice that the story of equity is the story of how the relief which the ChanceUorgave to oppre^ed and remediless suitors became more and more systematic, until u eventuaUy resulted in a whole set of courts existing parallel to and yet quite distinct from those of the common law , and known as theCourts of Equity or \"courts of conscience.\" It is from these extra ordinary courts, whose jurisdiction was both concurrent with, and superior to, that of the courts of common law, that the present Chancery Division of the High Court has descended.The term \" courts of conscience \" was in many ways a singularly correct description of the courts of equity, and indeed it conceals in itself fe very essence of equity. For, while on the one hand it is still necessary to-day for a lawyer to have some understanding of the meaning of this phrase,.\" courts of conscience,\" even for the ordinary practical purposes of his business, at the other end of the scale it carries us deep into the roots of human consciousness. What does it mean? Equity is of course a branch of civil law, and the court wouldmove only at the instance of a plaintiff with some grievance. But in spite of this, the principle which underlay the relief granted was not, as at common law, the satisfaction of the aggrieved plaintiff. On the contrary, the court was concerned to clear the conscience of 103the defendant. His conscience could be cleared only by repentance, and in order that he might repent, it was necessary that he should rst of all make restitution to the person whom he had wronged. One cannot, as the King in Hamlet knew, \" be pardoned and retain the offence.\" Now the common law took no account of such personal rights and obligations as these. A man might be a notorious rogue, but nevertheless he could succeed in evicting from a piece of land (if he could show that it was technically \"his\") another man whose personal right to the land was universally admitted to be far better than his own. This was where equity stepped in. When such a situation arose, the sufferer could apply to the Chancellor, and, if satised of the rights of the case, the Chancellor would say, in effect, to the oppressor: \" It is perfectly true that you have this legal right to the land, and if you choose to go to law to enforce it, the cominon law will assist you. I cannot stop that. But there is something else that I both can and shall do. The moment you begin any such action, in order to prevent you going on with it, I shall imprison your person for contempt of my court.\" Thus the would-be oppressor was helpless. He had a legal 'right,' but equity prevented him from enforcing it for ' personal' reasons. The maxim was: \"Equity acts in personam.\" * There was another sense in which the c\u00bburts of equity were' courts of conscience.' The person who applied for relief must be able to show that his own conscience was clear. Otherwise the comt would not help him. \" He who seeks equity must do equity.\" In enforcing this principle the Chancellor would particularly take into account the degree of knowledge of certain signicant facts which the parties could be shown to have possessed at the time when they acted. (This is the important equitable doctrine of\" notice.\") Thus the courts of equity were indeed concerned with a relation between two persons; the relation itself was felt as a reality, as something which changed its nature according as the state of mind\u2014as the state of knowledge\u2014of either party in relation to the other altered. Now criminal law also takes account of the state of mind of the wrongdoer. An accident is not a crime. Yet the criminal courts could never be called ' courts of conscience.' With them it is simply a question of establishing that the accused did in fact intend the consequences of his action. A crime is essentially an offence againstthe group of which the criminal is a member. It is breach of the King's peace. Whereas the infringement of an equitable right isthe wronging of another individual human being. It depends on a relation between two persons. T o understand this, it is necessary to go rather deeply into the meaning of the word ' conscience.' Like ' consciousness.' of which 104it is philologically merely a variant form, the word conscience originally means 'knowing with.' It implies a state of knowledgeeither shared with, or at any rate considered in relation to, another being. That this 'knowing with' another (which, reduced to its lowest terms, is the bare admission that there is another being) is, rst, an act of will, and, secondly, that it is the basis of self- consciousness\u2014these are sublime truths which may be demon strated philosophically, as they were by Hegel and by Samuel T aylor Coleridge. But they are also truths which ros-y be wonfrom purely moral experience by persons of the most limited intel ligence. By watching oiurselves, by watching the harm t^t we keep doing in some of the most intimate experiences of life, we may come to grasp this truth. Let us suppose, for instance, that in the midst of some argumentwe pull ourselves up, nding that we are becoming excessively dogmatic, excessively self-assertive. W e discover Aat we no longerwish the other person to arrive at the truth by his own volunt^ act. We are now trying to force our own thought outward at his expense, to remove him from the path, to put him to sleep. W e donot want to admit his right to a separate existence. We should like his mind to be a sort of mechanical attachment to our own, regis tering assent at intervals, simply in order to keep us sufciently conscious to be able to enjoy the act of thinking and the accompany ing sense of power . But this is not a true increase of self-consciousness. Such an increase will come only if we are willing to a^ptthe pain of his otherness, to acknowledge his full and equal right to be other than ourselves. It is only this pain and contrast which can shock us into a real awareness of ourselves. , j- ,,This is only an example. The point is that out of quite ordinary everyday experiences (between two persons) one may come to per-ceive the profound truth that is contained, for instance, m Cole ridge's Essay on Faith, where he shows the necessary relation between consciousness and conscience. Self-consciousness is made possible only by the voluntary recognition of another self-conscious ness. It becomes possible when, by an act of free will, we resist the impulse to regard other human beings as mere phenomena, asmere points on the circumference of a circle; and it is developed in\" at any moment only to the extent that we are able to acknowledge with our whole heart that these others too are centres, centres of T aual status with ourselves. In Coleridge's words, we rnust \"nega tive their sameness in order to establish their equality .\" Self- consciousness has its rise in the recognition by one being of thee q u a l i t y o f a n o t h e r b e i n g . I t i s a g i f t w h i c h m e n c a n r e c e i v e o n l y at the hands of one another. It may be objected that too much importance is attached to aware of what we are? The answer is, of course, that only by 105self-consciousness. Why is it so desirable that we should become doing so can we become aware of the Spirit in which we are. It has been common ground for the great religions of the world that self-consciousness, when deeply realised in self-knowledge, involves God-consciousness. But it is just here that an important distinction may be made. Religion has always possessed as its heart the truththat God is to be sought for in the Ego of man, and Moses so far made this doctrine exoteric to the ancient Hebrews when he preached the I AM. But here the Ego is always emphatically the Ego of the seeker. Only one religion has ever taught that Godis to be sought in the Ego of another man, and that religion is Christianity. The central discovery wrought in a man by the ancient mystery religions was the discovery \"I am divine.\" The crucial discovery wought in a man by Christianity is the experience \"thou artdivine.\" It is only reflected in another that we can see the eternal Self which we are, but not yet. Christ can only make his home in a \"relation between two persons.\" For a relation between more than two implies the relation between each two\u2014where two or three are gathered together. If the incarnation of Christ be indeed at the centre of the evolution of the Earth, then, as only 2,000 years have elapsed since it occurred, we can hardly in our time have touched the threshold of the age of Christianity. For contrast this paltry 2,000 years with the asons that preceded it and the aeons that are stiU to follow! Such is in fact &e view of Spiritual Science. We also realise, when we begin to get that rmer grasp of the evolution of consciousness which it assures, that the fourth Post-Atlantean Age (beginning with the year of the foundation of Rome and ending in 1413 a.d.), while it was in some few respects the best, was in many others the worst adapted of all for understanding the great Event which it brought to Earth. It was, for example, an age in which theinstitution of slavery was widespread and acknowledged. The word \"equity\" (Latin cequus) is closely bound up with the notion of equality. If we recollect all these things and if we also can^ in our minds a sense of the great spiritual signicance of this recognition of an equality of status as between two persons (a feeble attempt has just been made to this put before the reader), then it becomes a simpler matter to comprehend the really very strange and distinctive quality of this equity\u2014this ' roguish thing'as one of the old common lawyers called it\u2014which springs rather suddenly into prominence in England at the dawn of the fth Post-Atlantean Age. Then too (and there is much more that could be said, were there space) in spite of all the nonsense which no doubt has been taDced, in spite of all the base uses which the growth of technical equity has served, and of which something is shortly to be said, it is impossible not to abandon prejudice and admit thatthe true body of equity has a certain breath of fragrance about it and that that fragrance is the fragrance of Christianity itself. One of the most memorable things in Rudolf Steiner's book, The Threefold Commonwealth, is the way in which he identies with the three members or systems of the modern State the triple ideal of the French Revolution\u2014Liberty, Equality and Fraternity. He points out that the ideal of the equality of all men is indeed capable of realisation, but that it will be realised only if it is under-stood to what sphere of the whole social organism, and thus to what aspect of the individual human being, it applies. To be an expression of the equality of all men is characteristic of the pohtico- legal structure of the State, of that life of reciprocal rights which corresponds in man himself to the life of feeling, out of which his private social relations with other men are built up. In other r e s p e c t s m e n a r e n o t e q u a l . . . .Now the phenomenon of equity and the way in which, originating in the sphere of rights, it has gradually spread outward and incor porated itself in a metamorphosed form into the economic life,throws much light on this conception. It is charactenstic of thethree members or systems of the modern State to interpenetrat^n this way , just as it is characteristic of the threefold man. The important thing is that they should be able to be sep^ated in ourt h i n k i n g a b o u t t h e m . A n d t h e h i s t o r y o f ^ \" ^ t y a s s i s t s u s t o d o this.

Theoretically he could, if he chose to ignore the trust reposed in him, conne the whole enjoyment to himself. Thecommon law courts would not recognise B's right at all. But theTOurts of equity would prevent A from doing anything of the sort. By putting his trust in A, B had created a certain relation betweentwo persons, a relation which bound A's conscience; and equity would see (such was the theory) that A's conscience was preservedfrom the damage which it must suf fer by ignoring that obligation.B s personal right to enjoy the land was thus something so secure, so couCTete, that he could sell it, and the purchaser would obtain something which for practical piuposes was as good as the land Itself. Thus the ancient feudal attachment of man to the land wasallowed to fade away into the background. It did not wholly disappear , but there came into existence, hovering as it were aboveit, a quite separate system of ownership, in which the theory wasthat, not the land itself was owned, but the personal right to enjoy it.Under the feudal system it had been in some respects almost as true to say that the land owned the man as that the man owned the land. But now these personal rights had come to be felt as thingsno less actual and concrete than the land itself. They could be left in a will, bought and sold, dealt in. The conception of property had thus become a much freer one. It no longer involved a kind of physical oneness with the object owned. It was a personal right The characteristic of this kind of property was the ease with which it could be transferred from one person to another. Thus in a sense the equitable doctrines of ownership xmderlay the whole phenomenon of the growth of commerce and the rise of the freecities. In commerce, the relations of human beings to one another are based not on the land but on cash. This is not necessarily anevil. It is rendered evil by the egoism of human beings, but that makes other things evil also. A commercial 'bargain' is not essentially a transaction by means of which one human being' does'another and gains something at his expense. Essentially it is a transaction from which both are the gainers, and as such is a material reflection of the spiritual signicance of men's coexistence on the Earth: How great that spiritual signicance may be, we have just seen. It was precisely in connection with the commercial loan of money that Steiner pointed to a \"relation between two persons.\"But the development of that conception of property which equity fosters did not stop here. We have traced it, in the case ofland, from the old feudal conception to that of a mere right, albeita right which could be bought and sold for cash. There remains the question of the nature of property in cash itself. *In the same course of lectures on World Economy, Dr. Steiner, speaking of the history of the loan, points out that the loan in its pristine form was a gift for which the consideration was not adened contract to repay the exact amount with or without interest, but rather a tacit understanding that the present bopower would be willing to become a lender in his turn, should occasion arise. Againone sees that he thought it characteristic of the loan that it creates a peculiarly personal relation. Now it is just this whole sphere of personal relations, relations which are based on some kind of con dence, some ' trust' or ' credit' that is so peculiply the sphere of equity. Trust is the soul of equity. So strong is its sense of the concreteness of the situation which is created as soon as one man places condence in another and acts accordingly, that it will, up tothe limits of possibility , presume that the condence p justied. Equity , it has been said (and the doctrine is of practical important\u2014^for instance, in the construction of Wills), \" imputes to a man me intention to full his obligations.\" It does much more. As a juage on the Queen's Bench asserted in 1885, \"Equity looks upon that as done which ought to be done.\" This does not, of course, mean that in the ordinary course of litigation a man who has made a promise will be excused from fullling it. But there is one case in which it almost amounts to this. The influence which such conceptions have had on the development of money , and of those numerous substitutes, such as cheques, which are its virtual equivalent in many of the transactionsof modem social life, can hardly be exaggerated. It is one ming tora f r e e m a s o n r y o f m e r c h a n t s a n d b a n k e r s t o h a v e a c q u i r e d t h e h a b f f of exchanging one another's promises to pay m sptlement ot their debts. It is another when such customs become incorporated mto the law of the land, so that some of the sharpest and most subtle brains are occupied in dening the situations which result and endeavouring to make them of universal application. The economic process deals with physical things. When rights begin to be bought and sold and used for the payment of debts,we see them trying to turn into physical things. They become abstracted from the personal relation which is their essence, and the result is confusion. For instance, it is apparent enough to common sense that there must be some difference between \"paying\" and \"promising to pay.\" But to-day, if the Bank of England has promised to pay me \u00a35, it will fulfil that promise by handing meeither one or ve or ten pieces of paper having printed on them the words, \" Bank of England promise to pay the Bearer on demand the sum of \u00a35\" (or \u00a31 or 10/- as the case may be). Must a \"promise to pay\" be a promise to pay something, or may it be a promise to pay nothing? Are these promises \"money\"? What is money ? Does it exist before it is issued, and, if so, to whom does it belong ? These are some of the questions upon which an absolutely 108109i i t h e m i n d s o f p e r s o n s i n t h e h u m b l e r w a l k s o f l i f e b u t a l s o a m o n g t h o s e w h o m d e ^ j t i n vthe central baironhSn a t i o n s o f t h e w o r l d .

Waterlows. This is the highest tribunal in the kingdom and from it there is no further appeal. It had to decide (inter alia) the question whether a bank (with a right of note ispe simile to thatof the Bank of England), when it issues its own inconvertible notes in exchange for forged ones, is the poorer by the face value of the notes or whether it has lost merely the cost of printing thern. It had to decide whether the Bank of Portugal was coirect in claiming that the replacement of the forged notes \" cost\" it half a milhon sterling, or whether Messrs. Waterlow were correct in claiming that it had cost only a few thousands. This would appear to be a pretty fundamental question. The House of Lords does not know the answer to it! Of the ve Lords Justices of Appeal, three decided for the half million and two for the few thousands. It is perhaps worthy of remark that the rst three are men who have gained llieir experience in common law advocacy, while the two dissentientscome from the Chancery, or, as it is often called, the Equity Bar. * Such confusion on such a subject is unfortunately of more than theoretical importance. For what effect does it have when the essentially inter-personal nature of promises and \" creditis for gotten, when rights are metamorphosed in men's minds into the semblances of physical things, so that the attempt is made to compel them to obey physical laws ? The result is that the world is caught within a network of unreal ghosts of personal obligations. A situation arises in which the whole world is in theory (but the theory is acted on) head over ears in debt to\u2014^itself. Huge sims of money are owed to nobody and are withdrawn from circulation to liquidate that spectral debt. But without money the world cannot get at the goods which it produces, and, as a result, it soon ceaseseven to produce. We therefore have a world starving to death in the midst of material plenty. The latest (1932) unemployment gure from America alone is 8,000,000.The failure of the whole system of nancial credit built up by the Western world, with which we are now threatened, will not be due to a lack of personal condence between human beings. This has probably never been greater than it is now, as is proved by the very abuses to which it is exposed. Condence could not be abusedon the scale practised by the late Ivar Kreuger, if there were not plenty of it there to abuse. No. The failure will be due to ignorance of the nature of credit and the position it has come to occupy in the economic life of the world. It will be due, and so far as it has already happened, it is due, to inability to realise that condence is an immaterial substance, and not a material one. The failure of 111 GB-8credit reacts on the land itself. The substitute for genuine credit, for personal trust, is collateral \" security ,\" and people quickly come to feel that the safest of all securities is land. For it alone is indestructible. Thus the land becomes pledged deeper and deeper ,as attempts grow more and more desperate to postpone the meetingof the enormous debts, the ghostly obligations, the obligations to nobody , which in fact will never be met because it is mathematically impossible that they should be. Laws are passed which make iteasier to alienate land, easier to chop it up into small separately- owned pieces, easier to pledge it. Such was the tendency of the 1925 legislation, which is associated with the name of the late Lord Birkenhead. The picture is indeed nearly as dark as it could be. Pestilence and famine have come upon men before, but they have come as the result of the natural forces of the earth. Or\u2014over smaller areas\u2014 they have been brought about by certain easily identiable personalcrimes. Never before have they been caused, as they are being caused to-day, by something between the two, by the natural or at at any rate impersonal, forces of a sort of second earth, an earth which is not the physical earth at all, but is compacted of the personal relations of men with one another and of the uneasy ghosts and decaying relics of such relations. Perhaps it is for this very reason that more and more peopleseem to be drawn to the study of money-problems. In the last decade it has been by no means uncommon for souls impelled rather by a vague spiritual unrest than by any instinctive interest in economics to apply themselves to the study of such things as credit and currency. Is this because behind the thick darkness in which money, the \"root of all evil,\"i is shrouded, a darkness which hasnow extended itself from the moral over the intellectual sphere, they divine the mysterious presence of the root of all good? Reallyto understand a perverted and morbid growth involves understand ing the healthy body of which it is the perversion. Really to understand money involves understanding that above the decaying, increasingly mechanised physical body of the earth, whose future even science predicts to be increasing cold and darkness, there is coming into being another earth, an earth which is literally com posed of the relations of human beings with one another, an earth whose destiny it is to become increasingly one of light. This at any rate was the teaching of Rudolf Steiner, and it is this picture of the two earths, the \"real\" and the personal, of which the old-fashioned \" trust\" of settled land appears to me to be a sort of clumsy but honest caricature. Or rather it is more than this. For what is contained in this most characteristic of aU the creations of the old courts of equity? Apart from all other con siderations, there is contained in it a certain striking and impressive form of thought\", and anyone who has ever attempted to inculcate an idea with even modest pretensions to being new, will understandwhat an important part of the task is this establishment of a suitable form of thought. At the end of his Republic, Plato makes Socrates reply to someone who objects that the city which he has been describing exists nowhere on earth. \" But perhaps there is a pattern laid up in heaven for him who wishes to see it and seeing to dwell therein himself. Nor does it matter at all whether the city is or ever will be in any particular place.\" This has often been interpreted in the sense that philosophers ought to go on dreaming and not to trouble whether or no their dreams come true. The city is called the \"ideal\" city, and ideal to-day means non-existent. This is not what Plato meant at all. He intended to say that his city is already there as a spiritual reality, and as one whose very nature it is to seek material expression on earth. Those who become aware of such spiritual realities, allowmg their minds to be lled with such (in this sense) ideal pictures are really in a position to say from one point of view that it \" does not matter\" whether or no the spiritual reality is \"realised\" in the earthly sense at some particular time and place. But this does not mean that they will be indifferent and inactive\u2014^like a lazy politician for whom the ideal is the conveniently unattainable. On the con trary, those whose grasp of the eternal is strongest, and for whom therefore at a certain level no earthly event matters, wiU be precisely the ones to act most as if the destiny of the earth mattered to them. For they will have the strength which such action demands. 11 fear this is misleading. The allusion is to a remark by Dr. Johnson; but what he actually said was; \"The love of money is the root of all evil.\" \u2014O. B., 1960. POSTSCRIPT In 1932, when this article was written, the economic and social climate in this country, and in the West generally, was very different from to-day. In the late twenties great misery had been createdhere by extensive and lasting unemployment, while in America the storm of the 1931 economic crisis had only recently burst. Raw materials, labour and the necessary skills appeared to be availablein plenty , but they could not be brought together and set working because of a shortage of \"money\". The paradox of \"poverty inthe midst of plenty \" was the all-pervasive and startling phenomenon which had led to monetary theories such as that of Professor Soddy , and to the small but growing Social Credit movement inaugurated by Major C. H. Douglas.The production of goods cannot be nanced unless there is a 112 113reasonable prospect of selling them later on and so recovering the cost, \"^ey will not be able to be sold unless a sufciency of purchasing-power is, at the time when they come on the market,being distributed to the consuming public in the form of wages.These are the (largely false) assumptions of orthodox nance. In a mghly organised industrial society , however , a large and ever- increasing proportion of the wages so distributed is paid out in respect of current production (of tools, machinery, etc.) which willonly bring further consumable goods on to the market in a relativelyremote future\u2014^long after the wages so distributed have been spent. Meanwhile, in order to absorb the money now being distributed, the prices of the goods now on the market tend to rise. The circle, or spiral, thus being created, is arrested whenever production ceases to expand, or whenever it is feared that production will cease to expand; and there comes about what is called a \" slump \". This is the disease which results from the false assumptions. I must be content with this very lame epitome of the arguments of the credit-reformers of the twenties and thirties. Now on one interpretation of the Portuguese Bank Case (and it is the one I accept, though it did not nd favour with the majority of the Law Lords) in such a highly organised society , when the gold standard has ceased to operate, \"money\" is the same thing as \"credit\" and \"credit\" is daily created by banks in the form of loans, even when they have not, as in the case of the Bank of Portugal, any right toissue their own notes. Whether I own the particular \"chose-in- action \" called a banknote, or enjoy the other kind called a bank loan (resulting in a credit-balance on which I can draw cheques), makes no difference. Thus, the fact that\" banks create credit \" and only banks create it (and, by calling in their loans, destroy it) was another plank in the platform of the credit-reformers and was adduced as one of the prime causes of poverty in the midst of plenty . Nor were they by any means alone in this view of credit-creation. During the years1920 to 1927 the Chairman of the Midland Bank, The Right Hon. Reginald McKenna, had been regularly utilising his annual speechto its shareholders to educate the public in the same view. \" I am afraid,\" he said in January, 1925, \"the ordinary citizen will not like to be told that the banks or the Bank of England can create or destroy money.\" (In some of his own speeches to his own share holders, the Chairman of the Westminster Bank made it clear that he did not like it either.) Briefly, in the thirties a large number of people were becomingconvinced that there was an articial shortage of purchasing-power, and of these a not inconsiderable number held that the uncontrolled power of creating and withdrawing credit, which lay in the handsof the banking system, was at least one of its causes. For the people who run the system did not even understand it themselves,the ideas in their heads being ai^licable Only to a stqte of affairs 114which had ceased to exist. Everyone knew that reckless inflation of the currency, of the kind that had occurred in Germany soon after the last World War, was disastrous and must be avoided at all costs, but the real bugbear of the thirties was deflation\u2014^the- whole sale restriction of credit by the calling in of existing bank-loans and the refusal to issue fresh ones except on onerous terms. For it was this that produced unemployment. T o-day the climate is very different. We rarely if ever hearthe cry of \" poverty in the midst of plenty \". T^ere is virtually no unemployment problem, and on the whole it is inflation rather than deflation that we fear. Nobody seems to bother very much whether banks create credit or not, or at all events the number of those who do would appear to be decreasing rather than increasing. A number of causes have contributed to bringing this about. In the rst place, Douglas himself had always said that the alterna tive remedy to his own was a large-scale war. During war, pro duction is undertaken and maintained on an enormous scale (with the resultant liberal distribution of purchasing-power) and there can be no slump, because no one dares stop to consider whether the loans which provide the expanded purchasing-power will ever be repaid. Moreover, this production is of the kind that does not bring further consumable goods on to the market. You do not produce a torpedo or a rocket in order to sell it. Not only has there in fact been such a war, but ever since it ended a high level of expenditure on the development and maintenance of war- potential has continued. Under war and post-war conditions theshortage of actual goods is more apparent in most parts of the world than a shortage of money to buy them with. Secondly , the world's ideas on the subject of loan-nance have undergone a considerable loosening, largely under the influence of Keynes and his disciples, here and abroad. Those who heardPresident Roosevelt's broadcast inaugural speech on assuming ofce will remember his beginning the assault. If nancial rectitude, according to banking ideas, meant the starvation of millions, nancial rectitude could wait. The mental picture of large-scale,and particularly international, \"loans\" as temporary advances to be repaid in due course, as when one man borrows half-a-crown from another , has ceded somewhat to the mental picture of them as a mere machinery for nancing production and distnbution. More- over, since the war, under the name of \" Economic Aid , the highlyunorthodox principle that some of the product of industi7 must be given away , if the wheels of industry are to be kept turning, has by fotce of circumstances been widely, if reluctantly, accepted in the United States. , , , Again, the nation that plenty was to be had for the asking, oncethe economics of distribution could be solved, was based on views of man and nature which are less widely accepted than they were. Non-economic motives have been proved to play a much larger 115m part in the behaviour of the masses than was assumed by the credit-reformers, many of whom proclaimed, during the early stages ofHitler's rise to power, that he was a mere tool of controlling nancial interests, and would be discarded when he had served their purpose! Again, soil-erosion and other disasters and warnings have brought home to many that nature herself is not an inexhaustiblemine of plenty available for crass scientic exploitation, and popu lations are increasing rapidly. Finally, there is the spectre of nuclear warfare. All things considered, the shadow under which we live to-day is not predominantly a nancial one. It was otherwise in the early thirties, and I think this needs to be remembered in reading the foregoing article, if some of its emphases are to be understood. On the other hand, I doubt ifthere is any less confusion of thought on the issues which it raises towards its conclusion than there was then. I doubt also whether the moneylending fraternity is much less powerful than it was then, though it has leamt willy-nilly how to ddle the worst effects of the system under which it operates. Te whole structure of investment, loan-nance and credit- creation cries aloud for the application of those clear concepts of \"loan-money\" and \"gift-money\" which Rudolf Steiner developed in his World Economy. But where is the will towards this to be found? It is, one fears, symptomatic of the absence of any such will in responsible quarters that the question raised in the Portuguese Bank case should have been buried by common consent, instead of being squarely faced. It may have done no harm therefore to recall it to memory now.Questions and Answers When we invited questions about Anthtoposophy. we had no idea what to expect.

But the angels do their work as messengers of the Father , in His sight. And every personal matter has its place in the evolu tion of the world. Dangers come where personal desires and ambitions are con ned with the voices of the good heavenly Powers. The history ofOinstianity is full of these dangers. Self-knowledge and world- knowledge are the cures\u2014taken to heart. A. B. * Seeing that we haye details of future civilisations and epochs, and evenof Jupiter, Venos and Vulcan, does this mean that humanity is assured of a future, no matter what happens ahout the latest homhs and rockets? If humanity is totally destroyed, will a fresh start he made? Can we he surethat the Higher Powers will prevent such a catastrophe? Questions about the future of the earth and of humanity arebound to arise in the minds of many who are aware of the trends of modern scientic research, leading to ever-greater penetration into the realms of the forces of destruction. But these questions cannotnd an answer if Ae starting-point of the search is not placed in the being of man himself. For the silent assumption of science that there is an absolute gulf between the earth and its kingdoms of nature, on the one hand, and the moral creative being of man, on the other, is in dire need of revision. Among modem philosophers (Heidegger and others) we can already see various attempts at tracing the subtle interplay betweenman and his environment. But the fundamental facts pertaining to the problem of interaction between the inner being of man and the cosmos we owe to the spiritual investigations of Rudolf Steiner, which he carefully couches in tenns entirely open to our active thought. A few indications, drawn from a lecture given in Novem ber, 1919, may illustrate this point.^ Speaking of the will-forces of man, connected with his metabolic processes, which have the power to disintegrate all substances and forces. Dr. Steiner identies them with the forces of destruction anddissolution of our planet The counterpart of these destructive powers is contained in the thoughts of men which are released during sleep. Obviously, however, the character and quality of thoughts released during sleep depends on the nature of thoughtsarisen and held by day .\" The destiny of our physical earth-planet in another two 1 Published as Lecture 5 in the volume entitled Lucifer and 4hrlman.thousand years will not depend upon the present constitution of our mineral world, but upon what we do ^d allow to be done. With world-consciousness, human responsibility widens into world- responsibility. With such consciousness we feel, as we look up to the starry heavens, that we are responsible to the cosmic expanse, permeated and pervaded as it is by spirit\u2014that we are responsibleto this world for how we conduct the earth. We grow together with the cosmos in concrete reality when behind the reality we seek the truth.\" And further: \" Yes, as man I am a unity, and moral impulses are alive within me. They live in what I am as a physical being. But as a physical human being I am fundamentally the cause\u2014 together with all mankind\u2014of every physical happening. The moral conduct and achievements of human beings on the earA are Ae real causes of what comes to pass in the course of earth-existence.\" Here we are confronted with a fact of incisive signicance: namely , that humanity is now entering on a new phase of moral responsibility , previously unknown to it, which is cosmic responsi bility. A glance into the past shows us that for long periods asense of responsibility towards others was limited mainly to the family or small local community into which people were born. T o-day, in many countries, the growth of welfare legislation is one sign that the general social conscience has widened; there is an ever-increasing awareness of the need to direct our thought andcare to those who are physically or mentally handicapped. And the development since the last war of aid to poorer countries, through the United Nations agencies and other channels, is anindication (even though political motives often enter into these projects) that the modem social conscience is beginning to be awaketo world needs. Thus we are advancing slowly in the direction, at least, of that cosmic responsibility of which Rudolf Steiner speaks: though it may be a long time yet before the signicance of his words is at all widely appreciated. lliose able to respond to his teaching in this connection will nd abundant guidance in the Spiritual Science that leads man to a Self-knowledge which is at the same time true World-knowledge. Rudolf Steiner's Calendar of the Soul takes the seeker of the spirit in continuous progression through the weeks of the year to an ever- increasing realisation of this cosmic responsibility . This may servea s a n e x a m p l e o n l y o f t h e p a t h w e m a y c h o o s e i n o r d e r t o g r a s p t h e new task which the course of human evolution has placed beforeus. In reality , the entire body of anthroposophical knowledge into which we may grow can kindle ever-new sparks of cosmic morality \u2014if the vigilance does not forsake us. So it appears that it is not at all a question whether we can be sure that Higher Powers will prevent the (possible) catastrophe of the destruction of humanity\u2014the question in tmth is: Will men awaken to the realisation that the Higher Beings desire (nay\u2014long!) Its119to be understood by men\u2014and joined by men. consciously, in maintaining with them the course of evolution ? T o return, in conclusion, to the present nuclear research which, it seems, h^ by no means a uniform character but is showing considerable diversity , is it too much to hope that a time may come when scientists will pierce through to a reality outlined by Rudolf Steiner in the following words \" A t o m s o f w h i c h o u r e a r t h i s s u p p o s e d t o b e c o m p o s e d c a n o n l ybe the corpse of the earth; something which is continually dissolving and will one day vanish when the earth itself is no more. For the earth is in dissolution! The truth will escape us until we see in every atom a part of the Christ-Spirit which has been there sincethat time. Of what then does the earth consist since it was per meated by the Christ-Spirit? T o the last atom the earth consists of life since Christ permeated it, and an atom is devoid of value, nor can it be recognised in its true nature, unless we see in it a sheath that encloses a spiritual part; this spiritual element is a part of Christ.\" Thoughts of this nature may help to guide men's thoughts and actions to new aims. V. E. P. * Is illness a punishinent, a help, a sign of progress, an opportunity to improve, or ... ? Ought we to try to avoid it ? If so, by anrtBfpsis ? by \"healthy\" living? by \"morai\" or \"ethical\" means? by spiritual progress? If we are ill, should we try medical or surgical cures? T o understand what illness means in human life requires a long view of time, in which the past and the future are of equal im portance with the present. Rudolf Steiner has contributed manyideas on the problem from this ^int of view. One can be described here; others are to be found in his books and lectures.^ In all his discussion of the subject, he sets great value on good health. In Knowledge of the Higher Worlds, where he discusses the conditions necessary for progress in the individual spiritual life, he stresses good health as the rst requirement. Clear discernment and emotional calm are important for the spiritual life and are difcult to attain when the affairs of the body are not in good order. Spiritually-minded people have a duty to strive for good health. Illness, however, he does not regard as the opposite of health,but as itself a process of healing. There is no suggestion that illness ought not to exist or should be stamped out. It should become an 1 From Lecture 14 in the Cassel cycle, St. John's Gospel in Relation to the other Gospels. 2 See for example the lecture-cycle, Manifestations of Karma. 120opportunity for attaining health\u2014that is, overcoming the cause ofthe sickness and creating better health for the future. In terms of repeated earth-lives, the future may be as distant as another lifetime beyond the present one, but the consequences are none the less real and true for appearing so much later. Broadly speaking, there are two types of illness. One arises mainly from the constitution itself; the other mainly from interference from outside by unhealthy influences or conditions. The distinction is not clear-cut; a constitutional factor may determine whether an outside circumstance or infection leads to actual illness, or whether its adverse influence is warded off. Where an outside circumstance predominates, the illness may be a hindrance, and it is wise to seek all reasonable protection from epidetnics and wrong circumstances. Nevertheless, should anyone fall ill in this way , he may still gain new forces in the course of recovery .The opportunity provided by the constitutional type of illness lies in the process of change through which recovery is brought about. Rudolf Steiner has described the T en Commandments as a means of therapy for human beings at the stage in history when the force of the individuality was beginning to take hold of the soul-life (Berlin, November 16, 1908). He has gone on to show how later on, in Christian times and at the present day , a therapeutic process is at work in which the human individuality itself uses illness to modify the organs of the body for its own purposes (Berlin, January 26, 1909).i The individuality takes hold more stronglythan usual of the organs from which the illness arises and begins to reshape them. In this way the body is changed so as to become a more useful instrument for the spirit, less hable to hinder the spirit in its tasks, than it usually is in the normal constitution of people to-day . Everybody is in need of reshaping in a spiritualsense at the present time. A sick person is at work on his own rehabilitation for the benet of his spiritual part. In these Berlin lectures Rudolf Steiner looks back to the far- distant past when illness was not yet part of human existence\u2014 before souls were incarnated into material bodies. At that time human souls were entirely identied with the universe around them. Thev lived then humanly as the plants exist now within Nature. Plants do not become sick from inside; they can be blighted only from outside by pests or wrong conditions. As long as human beings were protected by the Divine Order , they never fell sick.T h e y w e r e c r e a t e d h e a l t h y a n d o n l y l a t e r b e c a m e c a p a b l e o f d i s e a s e .This took place when they were released from the Divine Orderand by the power of the body , placed in the physical, material world, where souls must make their own relation to that which is around. Becoming independent, they could develop selfhood, but 1 These two lectures are at present available only in German. 121they likewise became liable to error. This led in turn to misuse ofthe bodily organs by the soul. When souls can err, bodies can sicken.Sickness is thus a result of Man's fall into the temptations of Evil. It IS likewise the process by which the effects of error are overcome and a new future state of redemption is prepared Every condition of good health which has been won through healing is a portion of Man's redemption. The spirit within is the healing agent, who can make use of the assistance offered by medicines good conditions and therapeutic activities. There is, however adistinction to be made between medicaments which suppress the symptoms of an iUness and those which foster the process of healingSickness has a purpose for the future. In the present it brings misfortune and suffering, to meet which, not only medicine, but much human skill and kindness are required. But it is not a waste of time and strength. It is hard work at the process of redemptionwhich in the future will bring not only well-being to the sick person himself, but to all mankind of which he is a part. E. F.

To study the spiritual knowledge imparted by Rudolf Steiner without doing anything about it can be felt as deeply unsatisfactory . And yet the moment we try to carry it out in action, we encounter diflBiculties. If we expect to be able to convince other people directly of what seems to us manifestly true and illuminating, we meet the harshest disappointments. And these may even lead to the con viction that it is useless to try \" to spread the knowledge of Anthro- posophy \".T^ree qualities above all are needed if we are to nd a right Iwlance in this matter: self-knowledge, condence in destiny , and the power to listen. Looking back without emotion on our successes and failures in the past, we can observe what has in fact helped or hindered us in the attempt to share spiritual knowledge. All tendencies towards argumentativeness or dogmatism, for example, stand out as hindrances. Through self-knowledge, a temperamental inclination to rush in too soon, or to hold back too-long, or to alternate between the two, can be recognised and admitted. Real condence in destiny teaches us that each human being continually encounters opportunities to further the purposes of thespmtual powers, if lie is sufciently alert. No encounter withanother human being is really an accident. Never is anyone laid 122aside by the spiritual powers as useless\u2014though there are periods in most lives which seem to bring hardly anything but frustration. Such periods may really do more to prepare a man to meet his opportunities rightly later on, than any others.Only a thoroughgoing willingness to listen can train us to bring what spiritual knowledge we may have in a forrn suitable for the one who is seeking it. It is pointless to bring spiritual knowledge unless it is really sought; though the seeker may have very little idea of what he is trying to nd, or even that he is seeking at all.Words can carry much more than is consciously known by the speaker.Those who try to serve the purposes of Anthroposopny do not need only to be able to listen to others\u2014but to themselves as well. It can be audible in the sound of one's own voice whether an attempt to convey spiritual knowledge is ef fective and helpful ornot. We need time to assimilate any particular fact of spmtual knowledge before passing it on; Rudolf Steiner spoke in this con nection of the period of a year. Yet a fact may remain on the surface of our consciousness, and never really be made our own. Only when an idea sinks deeply into our feelings and is wanned bythe light of meditation, does it really begin to be assimilated. In his book. Knowledge of the Higher Worlds, Rudolf Steiner describes the conditions that have to be observed if spiritual organs of vision are to be developed in a right way . This book can be of immense value, even if we feel very far from developmg such organs. For the qualities and characteristics described theres asthose which the student should try to acquire are those needed for every service of the spiritual world. Certainly no one should wait,brfore attempting any positive action, until he has achieve aU these qualities. But the more he can make them a natural and enduring part of his life, the readier will he be to recognise andfull the opportunities given by the spiritual world. S, 123B O O K R E V I E W S From Atom to Omega The Phenomenon of Man. By Pierre T eilhard de Chardin. (Collins, 25/-.) TT is just over a hundred years since Darwin made a breach between the scientic and the Christian views of man. Although some scientists and theologians have energetically tried to paste over the gap, it is still felt by many people to be conspicuously real. Indeed,it forms part of the larger ssure between science and religion in general. Much of the stir which has been caused by Pierre Teilhard de Chardin's book, The Phenomenon of Man, is due to the fact that the author appears to straddle this gap both in his book and in his own person. He was a Jesuit priest, and a palaeontologist of dis tinction.^ Of his book, one reviewer , quoted on the dust-jacket,wrote: \"He has created a synthesis of evolutionary science and religious doctrine that has the lucidity and sweep of Aquinas' Summa Theologia.\" This is a very large claim\u2014too large, I think, in several respects. T o begin with, \" lucid \" is scarcely the rst adjective I would choose to characterise Chardin's work. His thought is often extremely difcult to follow. More important is the fact that neither orthodox Darwinists nor orthodox Roman Catholic theologians could accept all Chardin's views. Rome refused him permission to pubhsh any of his major works\u2014including The Phenomenon of Man\u2014and barred him from teaching at the Catholic Institute in Paris. The main reason was his unorthodox view of original sin and its relation to evolution. Friends arranged for the publication of his work after his death in 1955. Scientists would have no great objection to much of his account of evolution. But even Sir Julian Huxley, a personal friend of Ch^din's for ten years, and with great sympathy for what he was trying to do. writes in his inttoduction to the book that \"manyscientists may , as I do, nd it impossible to follow him all the way in lus gallant attempts to reconcile the supernatural elements in Christianity with the facts and implications of evolution. . .Nevertheless, there are many people to-day who are impatientboth with orthodox science and with orthodox theology, and are looking for new ideas to unite the two. It is to such people that The Phenomenon of Man is making an appeal. I must now try to convey some idea of the argument of the book\u2014^but first, perhaps, I should suggest why it may be of special interest to students of Rudolf Steiner's work. Steiner , too, of course, had much to say about \"the phenomenon of man\"\u2014about his material and spiritual evolution. Apart from this, one encounters 124in Chardin's book a number of concepts reminiscent of some of those found in Steiner's work\u2014in particular, Chardin's emphasis on an evolution of consciousness accompanying material evolution. And nally, any writer who attempts to unify a scientic and a spiritual view of the universe must be of great interest to pupils of Steiner. * Looking back into the past, Chardin follows natural science in imagining a time when no life existed, but only unorganised matter. But he attributes to all matter what he calls a \"within\" and a \"without\". The \"without\", or external, aspect of inatter com prises all those properties studied and measured by science. The \"within\", or inward, aspect of matter is for Chardin a world of consciousness. Thus the primeval atoms of matter were at the same time primeval atoms of consciousness. Chardin says (and this, incidentally, is one of his crisper passages): Looked at from within, as well as observed from without, the stuff of the universe thus tends likewise to be resolved backward ly into a dust of particles that are (i) perfectly alike among themselves (at least if they are observed from a great distance); (ii) each co-extensive with the whole of the cosmic realm: (iii) mysteriously connected among themselves, nally, by a comprehensive energy. In these depths the two aspects, external and internal, correspond point by point. So much is this so that one may pass from the one to the other on the sole condition that \" mechanical interaction \" in the denition of the partial centres of the universe given above is replaced by \"consciousness\". . . . Atomicity is a common property of the within and the without of things (author's italics). The central process of evolution Chardin characterises as \" com- plexication \". Atoms gradually become associated as molecules, molecules as cells, cells as organisms, etc. But, seen from \"within\", the process represents simultaneously a steady elaboration of con sciousness. At each new level of material complexity, a new level of consciousness emerges. The earth itself was formed, Chardin says, by a kind of in- rolling of a cloud of dust or gas upon itself. At the same time, \" acertain mass of elementary consciousness was originally imprisoned in the matter of the earth\". As complexication proceeded, there must have arisen, Chardin suggests, a thin skin of living matter surrounding the earth\u2014a \" pre-biosphere\"\u2014and in this film, the\" within \", or psychic aspect, of the earth, was concentrated. Chardin then pursues the theme of complexication and \"in- rolling \" up the scale of life. He was rst and foremost a palaeon tologist, and when he begins to speak of the fossil record, one feels he is suddenly more at home. He notes that groups of creatures in the fossil record behave in time rather as a plant behaves in space. There emerges arst a \"bud\", a primitive ancestral type.This begins to unfold and branch out into various specialised types 125(a process the biologists call \" adaptive radiation \"). Each of thesebranches grows through the fossil record for a certain time, and then dies out. Each group of animals thus forms a kind of tree or bush in the fossil record: there is manifested, as Chardin outs it\" a phylum in full bloom Chardin assumes that each new \" bud the starting-point of a new free of fossils, derives from the tip of one of the branches or\" verticils \" of a previous free. These verticils are like \" a forest of exploring antennae \". When one of them \" chances upon the ssure. .. giving acress to a new compartment of life \", it breaks through and soon begins \" to divide in its turn into verticils. . , This is an imaginative picture of the accepted process ofDarwinian evolution, a groping process depending partly on c h a n c e , p r o c e e d i n g o n l y w h e n s o m e s p e c i a l i s e d c r e a t u r e s u d d e n l y nds an opportimity to expand into a new environment. Chardin realises, nevertheless, that the original \"buds\" of themain animal groups are not physically represented in the fossil record. If we accept Steiner's account of evolution, the origins of these groups must be looked for in a supersensible world. It is typical of Chardin, though, that he accepts the basic assumption of pence that each group must have a direct physical connection withIts ^edecessor . Tie fact that no such connection can be establishedm the fossil record is only what we should expect, he says, since it IS extremely unlikely that we should chance upon the fossil remains of the tenuous transition from one phylum to the next. In animal evolution, Chardin detects the same process of com- plexication which led from atoms to molecules, and moleculesto cells. But at the animal level, the process expresses itself characteristically in what biologists call \" cerebralisationThemost primitive creatures have virtually no brain. The nervous system is dispersed through the body , with a number of primitivebrains\" or ganglia dotted around. There are no special sense organs. The higher animals display a steady concentration ofnervoiK tissue at the head end, coupled with an increasing elabora tion of special sense-organs, eyes, ears, etc. In animals, in other words, the evolutionary process is directed particularly to develop ing head, nervM and senses. Accompanying physical cerebralisa- Chardin assumes a steady development of the Within of animal consciousness.Ih man, cerebralisation reaches a climax, and consciousness bre^s through into conscious thought. Chardin here joins biologistssu^ as Sfr Julian Huxley in attaching special evolutionary im-portance to the appearance of reflective thinking\u2014to the abilitv ofa thmkittg being to realise that it is thinking. Just as a new epoch or evolutiton began when molecules began to oomplex,ifv into ^ w ' l e o t h e r s tC h a r d i n s a y s t h a t \" t h e a c c e s s t o t h o u g h t r e p r e s e n t s a t h r e s h o l d which had to be crossed at a single stride\". Why it \"had to be, I do not entirely follow. But it is clear that Chardin equates thebirth of Man with the lighting up of a spark of fought in a higher anthropoid creature. In tnls event, he says, the theologian maypostulate a Divine intervention. In any case, Chardin seems to saythat the event must have occurred uniquely \"between two indi viduals \". At one moment, he implies, there were only apes; in the next moment, there stood Adam and Eve.The sparks of conscious thought then began to undergo on a higher level the same complexication which had governed org^icevolution. The process consists in the gradual exchange of thoughts, the accumulation of culture and tradition, the development of whatChardin calls the \" noosphere the totality of organised human T h e b i r t h o f t h o u g h t , C h a r d i n s a y s , o p e n e ^ h e w a y t o a g r a d u a l unication of humanity on a higher leveL This is in contrast to the adaptive radiation processes which affect the mam groups ofanimals. Chardin attached great importance to this human planetisation\", and sees in it the future direction of evolution; The idea is that the earth not only becomes covered by myriad grains of thought, but becomes enclosed in a single thinking envelope,to form, functionally, no more than a single vast gram of thought onthe sidereal scale, the plurality of individual reflections grouping themselves together and reinforcing one another in the act of a single unanimous reflection. This process will culminate in a kind of united higher conscious ness, an ultimate state which Chardin calls the \"Omega or \"Omega point\". Individual human egos will not lose theiridentities, but will become enhanced and fullled through par ticipating in this higher identity, the \"Omega\". This is a sketchy summary of a long and complex argument. But without some conception of the whole of Chardin's remarkable vision, it is difcult to discuss it critically. . . One of the most striking things about the book, beanng in mind that Chardin was a Jesuit priest, is that there seems little necessity or place in his scheme of things for anything corr^poMing to a Fall of Man\u2014nor for any active principles of Evil. There is a rather unsatisfactory appendix to the book which treats this question, where Chardin says that \"in all loyalty , I do not feel Iam in a position to take a stand\". It was this issue, more than anything else, which got him into trouble with his superiors and led to his being debarred from teaching. Without a clear conception of a Fall, it is natural that Chardin should see evolution as essentially a steady process of oscenf\u2014from 126 127simple to ever more complex manifestations both of matter and of<\u00bbnsciousness. It is this deep basic assumption that evolution\"must\" have proceeded from simple to complex in this way that haunts Chardin's work\u2014and, indeed, haunts science as a whole. For it is closely related to the scientic habit of looking for explanations of complicated material events in terms of simplerones. Science attempts to resolve all spatial phenomena into \"elementary particles\", and all evolutionary processes are auto matically seen in the same light. But a scienw which was truly concerned with \"phenomena\"as Chardin claimed to be\u2014would see that in the living world, in particular , the reverse principle of explanation is absolutely demanded. T^e cell makes no sense on its own or as an assemblageof atoms\u2014^it is the servant of a higher principle, the organism, ^e true \" explanation \" of ^e cell is the description of its functionin the organism. And I think it is true to say that all biological phenomena reveal living substance which is in the service of higher principles. Goethe recognised that all plants are, so to speak, servants of the Ur-plant. When we come to study Steiner's account of the evolution of ^n and the ^rth, we nd that exactly the same principle applies.The physi^l bodies of the animal groups and of man himself are to be understood as instruments of higher spiritual princioles descending to earth. The whole of evolution up to the beginningof the Christian era is to be understood as a process of incarnation\u2014 a descent of spirit into matter. Even matter itself has undergone such a descent, Steiner says. The mineral substances of to-day should not be regarded as the starting-point of evolution in the past, but rather as the end-productof an evolutionary process which began in a purely spiritual condition. From this standpoint, living substance must be regarded as having preceded mineral substance in the evolution of the earth. It is not surprising that this process should have left no obvious traces m the jiysical substance of the earth. But in the evolution of animals, this \"incarnation\" process is clearly reflected in thefossil record. Chardin himself emphasises how animal groups emerge into the fossil record like unfolding plants, while the \"bud \"from which they spring is invisible. A truly \"phenomenological\" contemplation of these fossil series leads naturally to the conceptof spirimal archetypes gradually incarnating from a spiritual con-dition into the material world. But Chardin, in common with science, is enmeshed in the concept of a continuous ascending evolutionary thread, from simple to ever more complex forms This assumption paralyses his thought especially when he comesto speak of human consciousness. His idea that reflective thought enaerged suddenly to distinguish man from animal is based on noevidence at all. It is a pure theoretical construction\u2014^but he speaksof it as though it was a simple continuation of his phenomenological study of man. He thus falls into the commonest of all pitfalls in modern science, which is to elevate a theory to the status of a fact. Actually, the evidence of the development of human consciousness points in the opposite direction. The study of the changing use of language,and of primitive tribes, suggest that the relation of early man to his environment was in many ways more complex than it is to-day. In particular, he saw instinctively the complex spiritual forces workingbehind the world of \" appearances\", whereas to-day we postulate a few elementary forces and particles as the ultimate causes of all phenomena. Steiner spoke of the evolution of human consciousness as a kind of contraction of awareness. Originally, man possessed a direct clairvoyant perception of the spiritual worlds, and felt as though his consciousness were spread out among spiritual beings. Gradually, his awareness has contracted into the fortress of his skull, froin which he now looks out through his senses at a material world devoid, so far as his immediate sense perceptions go, of spirit. Steiner says that this process of contraction has now reversed; man is evolving towards a new kind of awareness of the spiritual worlds. And he describes the Incarnation of Christ as the turning- point of the whole evolutionary process.But although Chardin may seem to have something in common with Steiner in that he speaks of a gradual Christianising of con sciousness, through the power of love, leading man towards a spiritual participation in what he calls the \" Omega\"\u2014^yet I think the essence of his thought is very different from Steiner's. It is cWacteristic that Chardin sees a \" spark of thought\" as differentiating man from animal, but he sees no special signicance in nwn's upright posture. But it is just this posture which speaks of a spiritual principle living in man but not present in the animals. It is this principle\u2014the Ego, as Steiner calls it\u2014which has to undergo a Fall and a Redemption. And the whole purpose of this evolutionary process is to bring something new into the cosmos\u2014 the principle of freedom. For Chardin, evolution means complexication at increasingly higher levels. But from such a process, all that can be expected is an elaboration of what was already there. Indeed, Chardin emphasises that the force of love, which is to direct mankindtowards the Omega, was already present at lower levels of evolution, more as a kind of force of nature. Thus, while Chardin's book is ostensibly centred on the \"Phenomenon of Man\", I tibink it by-passes the heart of the phenomenon. There is no feeling for the humto Ego nor for the spiritual freedom which will give meaning to its evolution. AndChardin is blind to this, I believe, because he looks for the sources of evolution so to speak, within a kind of primal substance of 129matter-cum-consciousness, and not in the true creative Word of the Bible.Hopes for English Drama About the time I nished reading the book, I encountered two passages in a lecture of Steiner's which I think are relevant here.He says; \"The assertion that matter brings forth spirit, human spirit, is identical with the assertion\u2014even if not actually expressed \u2014that Lucifer is God.\" And then: \"The assertion that forces, energies, are anchored in matter which can work on further inman\u2014this assertion is purely Ahrimanic, and he who makes it declares Ahriman to be his God\" (Dornach, mungen. Lecture 1).^ After reading this, I remembered the carving of the \"Repre sentative of Humanity\" at Dornach, where Steiner made visible the true phenomenon of man, as it needs to be understood by men to-day. Chardin's book conveys at times a strange impression as though some of the truths expressed in Steiner's carving were struggling to break through. But the great central Christ gure, the heart of the matter, so to speak, in all Steiner's work, remains curiously dimmed and obscured in Chardin's book by the veils of the Luciferic and Ahrimanic beings which surround it. This is not to condemn the book, but to characterise it as I felt it. Chardin was obviously a man of profound intuitions\u2014but there is a certain tragedy in the shape they have taken as he has expressed them in his writings. Nevertheless, there is in his work something of a true \"threshold\"' experience, such as increasing numbers of people will encounter, according to Steiner, as the century proceeds. No&ing, in fact, emerges more clearly from \" The Phenomenon ofMan\" than the urgent need for the concepts of spiritual science in m o d e m l i f e . To turn from Chardin's book to Steiner's lectures is like moving from a confused misty world, with sudden gleams of light pene trating the coiling, wraith-like clouds, into a bright clear day with a brisk, stimulating breeze blowing. The modern age badly needs such a change in its spiritual weather. But in Chardin, there is no more than a hint that the mists are beginning to shift. John Waterman.

U P O N a fl a t , o p e n s p a c e c a l l e d \" t h e s t a g e . \" s p e a k i n g t o o u g h t h eseveral voices of \" the actors,\" many of the greatest minds faiown to history have chosen to say what they had to say to their fellow mortals. If the necessary arrangements are made; if the actors do faithfully what the dramatist requires of them; if the auditors are in the actual physical presence of the actors; then these messages from the Cosmic Spirit can reach a world desperately in need of them. It is inexaggerably important that we should hear and heed what Shakespeare had to say to us in Hamlet and Lear; what Goethe had to say in Faust; that we should listen to Aeschylos and Sophocles and Euripides; to Milton in his Comus and his Samson Agonistes; to Schiller and Lessing; and to many others. We are inthe direst need of the ideas and impulses these great ones have wished to convey to us; but we can receive them only if we give them possibilities of reaching us. Such possibilities hardly exist to-day in any part of the world. Nor, despite the fact that we possess the greatest of all dramatists, do they exist in England. Admittedly, here and there, at this time and that, an effort ismade by some odd group of people to stage something worth stag ing. But the number of such efforts throughout the whole of this country from January to December could almost be counted onone's ngers and toes. How many theatres are there that make their business that which ought to be the supreme concern of a theatre-^the presentation of great plays ? Instead of \" great plays, well done,\" we have everywhere tenth- rate plays, badly done. \"Commercial\" theatre and \"repertory\" theatre are much the same sort of thing; both offer us transient excitement and amusement; neither makes the effort to elevate and educate us. There are thousands upon thousands of amateur dramatic societies; what in general characterises them is desire for social jollication; most of the people in them think that some absurdity by Shaw is great drama. For the most part, any acquaintance which serious-minded people get with great plays, they get by wireless and television. It is not possible here to argue out the question whether \" out of a tin \" (as they say) Aeschylos and Shakespeare and Goethe can satis factorily speak to us. I must be content to state my own vehement belief that nothing of the sort is thinkable. I am convinced that if we are to get that which dramatic art is meant to give us, we can get it only if we see and hear the actors in flesh and blood before tis, 131 GB-9I accept to the full the verdict of Bruno Walter: \" In our day of the telephone, the lm and the radio. I still insist that the mighty God dess of Presence will not be dethroned, and that in the playing of music, in dramatic presentations, in conversation\u2014^as also in love\u2014 only personal presence can produce the soul-warmth in which manis spurred on to his highest potentialities in giving and in receiving.\" In his great writings on Dramatic Art. Stanislavsky makes many such statements as the following:\u2014 Nothwithstanding the mountains of articles, books, lectures and theses, notwithstanding the researches, of the innovators, nothing hasbeen written\u2014with the exception of a few lines from Shtchepkin\u2014that might be of practical use to the actor in the moment of the realisationof his creativeness or that might be of help to the teacher at the moment he meets his pupil. All that has been said about the theatreis only philosophising; very interesting, very deep, and speaking beauti fully of the results it is desirable to reach or criticising the success orfailure of results already reached. These works are valuable and necessary, but for the actual practical work in the theatre they are useless. They are silent on how to reach results; on what it is necessary to do rst, secondly, thirdly, with a beginner; or on what is to be done with an experienced but spoiled actor. What exercises resembling solfeggi are needed by the actor ? What scales, what arpeggios, for the development of creative feeling and experience are required? Those studying dramatic art must be given numbers\u2014comparable to the problems in a mathematical textbook\u2014 for systematic exercise in school and at home. All books and works of the theatre are silent on such things. There is no practical text book. There are only attempts, but as far as they are concerned, it is either too early or altogether unnecessary to speak of them. The basic spiritual laws, informations, researches, practical exer cises, problems, solfeggi, arpeggios, scales, counter-point, composition, perspective, are lacking in relation to the art of the actor, and make ofthat art an accidental impromptu, often inspired, but oftener mere hack-work and routine. In the background of Stanislavsky's confession there lie in wait questions such as these: How did speech arise? What at their origins are \"vowels\"? Why such a thing as \"A\" and \"E\" and\" I\". etc. ? What are the \" consonants \" ?\u2014the \" soundings-with\" ? Why do we associate with that big white thing over our heads the sound-combination: \" cloud \" ? Why do we call this distress inside us \" pain \" ? Why do we say \" head \" in English. \" tSte \" in French, and \"Kopf\" in German? Why in everyday conversation do we make little half-hearted movements with our arms and hands? When he magnies and dignies these movements upon the stage, what does the actor achieve ? If we push back beyond speaking into man's past, why do we come upon recitative and further back upon sog ? What in the ultimate is \" Poetry\" ? What is \" Prose\" ? Why are we so nobly agitated by Dramatic Art? What does seeing a play rflect in us ? Drama-criticism of the highest sort can be found m the running commentary on Hamlet in Goethe's \"Wilhelm Meister\"; in the articles written by Yeats when he was working at the Abbey Theatre; in many other places. But nowhere, even in the best of all 132such elucidations, could Stanislavsky nd answers to his questions. The answers can in fact never be found in a science which con nes itself to the physical aspects of existence. But they arise of themselves out of what Rudolf Steiner has to tell us in his books and lectures about the higher or inner or spiritual aspects of our being and about the relation of these to the physical. Here I can only give a hint of what Steiner has to say. Goethe has it that the eye was formed by the Light for the Light. Steiner correspondingly asserts that the Divine Word or Logos formed man as a whole\u2014and his larynx, etc.. in especial\u2014^that he might utter speech. \"The human body,\" he says, \"is a musical instrument.\" If we accept the view that the Cosmic Word formed man to sound celestial music, it is not dicult to grasp that there is a mysterious underlying identity between the realities around and within us. There is a fundamental correspondence between the actual \" cloud \" and the actual \" pain \" and the sounds we use to indicate these entities. What is mystically the \"NAME\" of any entity (its very soul) is resolved into the \" name \" that entity goes by in common parlance. As Socrates puts it: \"And if anyone reproduces the essence of a thing in letters and syllables, does henot express the nature of the thing ? \" Speech is the revelation of reality. In bodily gesture the reality of a thing or process is magically disclosed to our eyes. In spoken words it is given audibility to our ears. In origin and essence, gesture and speech are one and the same. That we speak of \" feet\" in verse is a reminder that primitive man not only made sounds with his vocal organs, but at the same time visibly expressed him self with his limbs. Nowadays we use gesture sparingly and ineffectually. We rely on the auditory side of the speech-mechanism. It is part of the actor's trade to give greater prominence to gesture. , What we call \" consonants\" were at their original emergence a reproduction or imitation of the things and processes of the external world. What we call \" vowels \" were man's inner reactions to those outer things or processes. Words at the point of their origin in evolution are not anything arbitrary or conventional; they are a direct immediate effect of outer and inner realities. The differing aspects of man's environment resulted in his speech in thisor that consonant. His changing feelings vented themselves in the various vowels. (In the \" interjections \" we have a relic of man's prmal mibde of expressing his being) .... Somewhere far back in the history of every word of this \" fossil poetry\" of ours is to be found the immediate direct utterance of human experience. What Steiner would have us realise is that there has taken place in language a fearful decline, bringing with it for mankmd all manner of disastrous consequences. To speak mythologicaUy, than in \"the Garden of Eden\" sang the notes of a heaven-given 133music. He \"fell\". And his speaking \"fell\", too. Poetry is the language of Heaven; prose, of this earth. Man gradually lost his poetic afliations and became more and more (as his ego increas ingly asserted itself in earth-life after earth-life) a creature of prose. Every vowel and every consonant had at the rst elemental force; the sounds of words in and of themselves made prior decisive claims upon the attention; they were felt as grounded in reality; they arose spontaneously out of man's iimer being and the world about him. . , . The human being was once a noble musical mstrument upon which the Divine Beings could play harmonies. He has become degraded; he no longer takes delight in his musical utterance; heuses it for merely personal and utilitarian ends. Feeling for the sound-side of language has in these days almost disappeared. In another and far worse sense than that of M. Jourdain, we too unconsciously \" speak prose all our lives We are no longer able to listen to the sound and soul in a word; we ignore the sound and listen through it to the idea or content that the word expresses. Words are no longer alive. We are living in a word-cemetery. Yeats cries out; \"I h^ve to nd once again singers, minstrels and players who love words more than any other thing under Heaven\". If we would join in this great search, it will have to be with Steiner as our leader: The word now is made to serve for mutual understanding in social life and for imparting what has to be intellectually known. On both sides it loses its value. It is forced to t the sense which it is required to express The fact is forgotten that in the tone, in the sound, in theformation of the sound, there lies a reality. Beauty\u2014the shining of the vowels, the shape of the consonants\u2014is lost for speaking. The vowels become soul-less, the consonants void of spirit. And so speech entirely leaves the sphere of its origin\u2014the sphere of the spintual. It becomes the servant of intellectual knowledge and social life. It fallsfrom the spiritual. It is wrested completely from the sphere of art...Divine Spiritual Beings could once speak to the human soul by means of the Word. But now the word serves only to make oneself under stood in the physical world. . . . Things which were self-evident in the Ancient Mysteries, when human beings were still conscious thatDivine Beings spoke into them\u2014these experiences must once again befetched up out of the depths of man's inner being. We must nd the possibilit>' of knowing inward speech. Lewes in his ne \" Life of Goethe \" berates Goethe and Schiller because \"they could not bring themselves to believe that the Drama, which they held to be so grand a form of art, had ceased to be a lay-pulpit and had become a mere amusement.\" The Encyclopaedia Britannica (Fourteenth Edition) declares:\u2014\"ModernDrama .... is confessedly an entertainment.\" If we regard such views as disreputable and disastrous; if we nobly take our stand with Goethe and Aristotle; if we wish the theatre to be a temple and drama an art; what is it we have to do ? Steiner in his \"Drama Course\" and elsewhere has much to say about every aspect of Dramatic Art. But his essential concern is 134with speech. How shall the actor rediscover the lost art of speech ? Only when the answer to this question has been found\u2014urges Steiner\u2014will the Theatre be able to take again its rightful place in cultural life. How can we\u2014as good, evolving human beings- move forward out of a Theatre of Prose into a Theatre of Poetry ? Man was formed by Divine Spiritual Beings to speak cosmic music. He underwent an evolutionary fall. His speech took into itself corruption and mortality. It has become egotistical, earth- bound, materialised, utilitarian, abstract, lifeless, unmusical. It lies in front of us to re-introduce into speech, by our own conscious and willed effort, the divine quality it has lost. If the actor understands his vocation, it is in this sense that he will take himself. Stanislavsky postulates that if the actor is to succeed as an artist, he must have\u2014^not only in his head but in his blood\u2014com plete comprehension of the principles underlying speech. It is this that Steiner offers. From a hundred various stand-points; m general ways and in concrete particularity; in what he said and inwhat he wrote and in what he did; Steiner both elucidated the laws of speech and indicated all manner of \" practical exercises, prob lems, solfeggi, arpeggios, scales \", by means of which the actor can work those laws into his very being. The aspirant who turns to Steiner discovers to his delight that he is finding\u2014^not theories of Steiner's\u2014^but his own deeper impulses and his own artistic freedom. * Steiner's language in his own four \" Mystery Plays \" is to a large extent \" mantric \". He strives to re-assert the direct original force and beauty of the sounds used in speech. \" Most of the scenes in my plays\", he says, \"were written directly from hearing. I didnot seek for words to express sense and meaning. I wrote from hearing.\" And again he says that in these plays \"A new element is seeking poetic expression\u2014an inner formulation of sound\u2014of which to-day there is scarcely as yet a trace.\" And again that \" an etheric-poetic inward experience of sound will take the place of the outer-physical experience which is given in the end-rhyme and beginning-rhyme.\" In reference to one particular speech he says:\" One must see here a mystery of words. Actual world-forces lie in the sound. In the sounds of these words there is truly given an opening of the gates of the spiritual world \" The best illustra tion of what Steiner has to say in these lectures on Dramatic Art is to be found in his own plays. The lectures in this wonderful course may well be thought of as a commentary on his own practice as a play-wright. This translation of the \"Drama Course\" by Mary Adams is exceedingly well done. It is real English. Mary Adams knows German; but she knows English, too. She has taken the pains all along to discover for herself just what Dr. Steiner aimed at saying 135in German, and then she has done her utmost to say the equivalent thing for English readers. One is deeply impressed by the efciency of the whole volume. They say no book ever published was free from author's and printer's errors. There may be such errors in this translation, but I could not nd them. . . These pages set a model for ant^oposophical translating. And at the same time they remove the last shreds of whatever excuse we Anthroposophists in England may have thought we had for not getting on with the establishment of an anthroposophical theatre. ... It is fruitless merely to criticise the deplorable state of the English stage. The only protable thing is the sort of thing Dr. Steiner himself consistently attempted\u2014i.e. to try to exemplify in our own efforts what is the right thing to be done. What is primarily needed\u2014as Dr. Steiner himself repeatedly insists\u2014is a \" school\". There must be a centre\u2014preferably per haps some large house in its own grounds somewhere near London\u2014^where the essential thing is done. The essential thing is the most utterly genuine and thorough-going study of and work upon this Drama Comse by those who intend to offer plays to the public. It ought not to be expected of the producer of any particular play that he should coach actors in acting as such; they ought to come to him with aU that Dr. Steiner says about speech and gesture already instinctive within them.There could be a \" shop-window\" to this School\u2014set up no doubt for the most part in London, but taken also on torn: to Oifford and Cambridge and other parts of the British Isles and the British Commonwealth and to the United States of America. This \"Anthroposophical Theatre\" would resist every temptation to disseminate Anthroposophy! If it was equal to the task, it might very well present Dr. Steiner's Mystery Plays, but it would not feel called upon to push into undeserved prominence \" plays by Anthro posophists \". Its concern would be exclusively the presentation tothe public of GREAT PLAYS\u2014plays in themselves worth doing\u2014 plays that are great literature\u2014plays that educate and elevate\u2014Dr. Steiner's most certainly among them. Such a theatre\u2014although it would do nothing in the way of propaganda to spread Anthroposophy\u2014would perhaps be the mosteffectual of all means of making serious-minded English people think seriously about what Dr. Steiner has to say to mankind. The Drama Course exists. This English translation exists. In a thousand persons there is good will for the attempt. What has to be done can be clearly seen .. . What is now wanted is initiative\u2014 not make-believe initiative but the real thing; the resolve of some capable young person, or of two or three persons, to overcome everyobstacle in their way until this Anthroposophical Theatre of ours has become a fact. Arnold Freeman.The Celtic Light The Sun Dances. Prayers and Blessings from the Gaelic. Arranged by Adam Bittleston. (Christian Community Press, 12/6.) A T T , w h o l o v e C e l t i c l o r e w i l l b e g r a t e f u l t o A d a m B i t t l e s t o n f o rthis book of Gaelic poems. It contains a selection from the ve volumes of Carmina Gadelica, collected and translated by ^e lateAlexander Carmichael towards the end of the last c^tury . T wo of the volumes are now out of print and the others difcult of acces^ so that this selection is likely to be of great value to those mterestedin Gaelic life and customs. It is designed, however , to app^l to a wider audience and should win a deeper understanding for the unusual beauty and content of these little-known poenM. The book is attractively arranged and each section is mtroduced with a suitable Celtic design from Mrs. Carmichael s copies of decorations from ancient manuscripts. A brief foreword gives a sketch of Carmichael's work in collecting these devotional versesand prepares the reader for their unexpected quality . There arenine groups of poems, with a concluding verse like a nal benedic tion, and with a number of notes about sources. Alexander Carmichael was born on the island of Lismore in 1832, less than three months after the death of Walter Scott, who had already done so much to rouse interest and sympathy for the Highlanders. His work as a civil servant took him \"through theIslands and Highlands of Scotland, from Arran to Caithness, from Perth to St. Kilda's.\" He learned to love the language and way of life of the Gaels and gradually collected a wealth of ancient poems and charms which had been handed down for centuries by word of mouth. Adam Bittleston gives a vivid impression of this vigorous character, enduring danger and hardship in his literary quest, yet approaching the Highlanders with so much sympathy and imder- standing that they willingly conded to him their sacred traditions.The foreword prepares us for the strange quality of the prayers and blessings. They are the heritage of small isolated groups of an ancient race, untouched by the main flood of Roman civilisatton. From their life on the barren hills and rocks, amidst the ebb and flow of the tide and the vast sweep of the winds, the Gaels from prehistoric times had made their relationship with overwhelmingelemental powers. ^ . . u .u Fiona Macleod has written of a Gaelic wisdom older than Christianity . In \"The Book of the Opal\" he tells of an islander who had become a Roman Catholic priest, but felt he could no longer be true to his calling, for he had found a wisdom older thanthe one he professed and gods more ancient than his own. That old forgotten wisdom of his people came nearer to his spirit than many sacred words.\"Elsewhere Macleod has described certain sacramental customs of the islanders, by which they ensured a living sympathy with the 136137forces of nature. In some remote places, as soon as possible after a child had been bom, the mother would take it, and at noon, facing the sun, would touch its brow to the earth\u2014the Ancient Mother of all. Another ceremony was the handing of the child to its father through the smoke of the re. Some islanders baptised the infant in spray from the running wave, or held it up to the south wind to make it strong and fair and to hold back death and sorrow. The Church tried without success to prevent these survivals of nature-magic. We should not regard them, however, as mere superstitions. They had their source in an intimacy with nature found among many primitive peoples, a delicacy of awareness that the over-civilised have lost. Through his researches into the Hibernian Mysteries, Rudolf Steiner has enabled us to gain a deeper understanding of the Celtic background. While the pre-Christian religious centres of Greece and of the North guided man on his descent into earthly life and prepared in him independent capacities so that he could become free; the Hibernian Mysteries preserved an ancient spiritual wisdomas a protection against the materialism into which Western Europe was doomed to pass. Hence the leaders of the Celtic people never entirely lost their memory of a paradisal state. They retained a longing for that primal sympathy when man and nature were at one. They were well aware of the descent into the darkness, but they experienced this as the mist veiling the sun or the shadowthrown by the mountain. There is rarely found in Celtic poetry, as there is in Norse, a vivid sense of the terrible activity of evil. Legends tell of the Celts' imaginative participation in the Christ event. Through their religious cults they were aware of His birth. But the human aspect of Christ was not so vitally experienced; for them He was the Sun Being, descending through the spheres, bring ing harmony into the elemental world and illuminating the dark ness. His birth is described in the \" Christmas Carol\": This night is the eve of the great Nativity, Bom is the Son of Mary the Virgin, The soles of His feet have reached the earth. The Son of glory down from on high. Heaven and earth glowed to Him, All hail! let there be joy! The mountains glowed to Him, the plains glowed to Him, The voice of the waves with the song of the strand. Announcing to us that Christ is bora. In many poems, Christ is described as \" The King of the Elements\". We can thus understand that there was no contradiction between the old nature-wisdom and the acceptance of Christ. In this selec tion of poems it is often difcult to tell whether a particular verse was an ancient rune into which later the Christian gures found entrance, or whether it was composed by Celtic monks. In the\" Hatching Blessing\", for instance, Christ and Columba are invoked in what is obviously a magical rite.Christ was above all felt to be present in the rhythms of nature, in the interweaving of morning and evening, of summer and winter, of life and death. Through Him sorrow was transformed into joy, darkness into light, death into life. And as in a primitive society every deed is directed towards the maintaining of life, so the sowing of the seed, the weaving of the wool, the milking of the cow, were activities which could be brought into harmony with the move ments of the seasons, and could be Christ-enlled: Even as I clothe my body with wool, Cover thou my soul with the shadow of Thy wing. Adam Bittleston's arrangement of the prayers and blessings illustrates very clearly this awareness of the different spiritual experiences in the rhythms of day and night and the festivals of the seasons. Some of his titles are: \"Morning and Evening\", \"Ages of Life \", \" Work \", \" Wonders of the World \" and \" Feasts of the Year\". * Although the poems may seem strange, they are in no way vague or unclear. We immediately become aware that they do not voice any accepted creed but are born from living experience. For instance, there is the beautiful description of Barbara Macphie's vision of the sunrise on Easter Sunday. The Spirit is manifest in all aspects of nature. \"The God who makes the small blade of grass to grow is the same God who makes the large, massive sun to move \". The \" God of the Mysteries \" is present in the thunder: Thy joy the joy. Thy light the light. Thy war the war. Thy peace the peace. There is not only an intimacy with the movements of nature but also with spiritual Beings. The Archangels and the Saints are well-known companions. Nevertheless, every theme is expressed in a clear and concrete form, so that many of the shorter prayers are suitable for children; for instance the \" Mother's Consecration \" : Be the great God between thy two shoulders To protect thee in thy going and in thy coming, Be the Son of Mary Virgin near thine heart. And be the perfect Spirit upon thee pouring\u2014 Oh! the perfect Spirit upon thee pouring. Another characteristic which is of value for children is the frequent, often threefold, rhythmic repetition. There is a wealth of telling images which hot only bring the chosen theme into the realm of our experience but also evoke feelings of devotion or tenderness. The prayer for blessing on the kindling of the re leads to an entreaty for love to be kindled inthe heart. The Guardian Angel is addressed : 138 J 39Be thou a bright flame before me, Be thou a guiding star above me, Be thou a smooth path below me. And be a kindly shepherd behind me. Today, tonight and for ever. I am tired and I a stranger. Lead thou me to the land of angels; For me it is time to go home To the court of Christ, to the peace of Heaven. Those who have heard Gaelic spoken or sung will recognise that no translation can reproduce the music of the language. But we owe a great debt to Alexander Carmichael for his sympathetic renderings. Even in translation the content and the quality of the feeling are still able to resound.The notes at the end, which give the sources of various poems, are illuminating. Particularly poignant is the lament sung by a mother over her child on the snow-covered mountains after the Massacre of Glencoe. A soldier, searching for stray fugitives, was so moved to pity that he did what he could to save them and they survived: Cold, cold, cold is my child, Cold, cold is the mother who watches thee; Sad, sad, sad is my plaint. As the tinge of death creeps over me. O Cross of the heavens, sign my soul, O Mother of breastlings, shield my child, O Son of tears whom a mother nurtured. Show Thy tenderness in death to the needy. * It is natural that these prayers should be different in mood from those springing from the more orthodox teachings of Christianity. We rarely nd any plea for courage, endurance or accomplishment. To those who were so intimately aware of spiritual presences, courage, as we understand it would probably have seemed a form of egoism or personal aggressiveness. For the Celts, life on earth was an exile and the material world a shadow realm; hence, although their descriptions of nature are often joyous and radiant, a note of wistful longing can be heard as an undertone. In the experience of endless alternation between light and dark and ebb and flow, the Celtic soul longed above all for peace:\" The peace of Christ above all peace.\" And, although the con cluding poem does not use the word, it is in this mood that the collection is brought to a close: As it was. As it is. As it shall be Evermore, O Thou Triune Of grace! With the ebb With the flow, O Thou Triune Of grace! With the ebb With the flow. 140It is understandable that the Roman Church, which strove to form a disciplined order, should have silenced the teaching of the Celtic Christians. But through the mysterious workings of fate, these records of an older wisdom have been preserved and redis covered. There is no longer any need to regard thein as suspect. We can now receive these echoes of an ancient time with reverence and acknowledge their beauty. Eileen Hntchlns. Bothmer Gymnastics I N t h e a r t i c l e e n t i t l e d \" G r a v i t y a n d L e v i t y i n H u m a n M o v e m e n t , \"which Miss Olive Whicher contributed to the last issue of the Golden Blade, she outlined the special character and purpose of the gymnastic exercises introduced by the late Count Fritz von Bothmer at the rst Waldorf School in Stuttgart, and mentioned that Count Bothmer's own book on the subject was soon to be published in German and in English. This is now available under the title of Gymnastische Erziehung, edited by Dr. Gisbert Husemann for the Pedagogic Section at the Goetheanum and published by the Philosophisch-Anthroposophischer Verlag, Domach. It consists ofthree spacious volumes\u2014^the German text in a stiff cover, with the English translation and a volume of illustrations each bound in stout carton. The German text costs 63/-; the English translation and the volume of illustrations can be bought separately for 35/- the two. Count Bothmer, formerly a cavalry ofcer in the German Army, was one of the teachers called together by Rudolf Steiner in the early days of the Waldorf School with the aim of developing new forms of education in tune with a modern spiritual conception of the nature of man. Bothmer was given the task of creating new methods in gymnastics. He died in 1941, leaving a manuscript in which he described his approach to this work and the sequence of exercises, covering the 12 school years. This manuscript has been translated by Olive Whicher, who adds a chapter on \"Human Movement in Physical and Ethereal Space \". Readers may remember that in her Golden Blade article Miss Whicher described, from her own experience of learning and teach ing the Bothmer exercises, how they can lead to an awareness ofthe spiritual and creative forces of space. Here she expands this theme, relating the exercises to the new treatment of projective geometry by George Adams, Louis Locher-Ernst and others, and quoting Bothmer's own words: \" If in practising bodily movement we take our start from research into the laws of space and listen to its clear rhythms, we shall nd deep sense and purpose in the 141resulting movements. We can discover that in our movements space reveals itself as a spiritual process, and that the body, through which we experience space, is itself a part of this process.\" The generous supply of illustrations includes early photographs of Bothmer himself demonstrating the exercises; drawings and diagrams based on his sketches; and a series of photographs annotated by one of the leading pupils. Elizabeth Dessecker. who has also added the school curriculum. This admirably thorough and careful publication will be essen tial wherever Bothmer gymnastics are taught; it can be recom mended also to students of Anthroposophy who wish to imderstand this aspect of Dr. Steiner's educational work, little known hitherto in this country except to specialists. c. w.SPEECH AND DRAMA Nineteen lectures by Rudolf Steiner, given in the Section for the Arts of Speech and Music, School of Spiritual Science, Goetheanum, Switzerland, September, 1924.

The outer forms of man and animal are rst compared and contrasted, and thereafter the true difference is shown between the kinds of inner experience they both enjoy. It is on this foundation that Dr. Poppelbaum proceeds to discuss- the true relation of both man and animal to their environment and to develop his critique of current theories of evolution and his exposition of Steiner's outlook.

Rudolf Steiner shows that the insoluble link between man and cosmos Is the fundamental basis of evolution.
