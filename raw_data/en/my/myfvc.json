The Doctor is In www.albany.edu 78 UAlbany Magazine Fall 2012 Mike Tritchoniswww.albany.edu 9 \"Albany was the foundation\" for Neil Capolongo's career as an orthodon- tist. \"It was a state university, but I found it to be a private school, in many ways. Its history as a teachers college was presented to us many times. Albany gave me leadership abilities; at 20 or 21 years of age, I'd have conversations with the University president and administrators, and conduct myself as an ambassador to visiting students and professors. I was in the Purple and Gold Society. Each experience impacted a part of my life. I have such great things to tell my patients about Albany.\" And tell them he does: At his office in Mount Kisco, N.Y., Capolongo encour - ages his young patients \"all the time\" to consider attending UAlbany. \"It's also wonderful to speak with current students and with other graduates. I hear good things. T oday, a patient told me that he visited the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering. It was great to hear how interested he is in UAlbany.\" Capolongo, who majored in biology, \"always wanted to be a doctor\" but later found himself \"on the fence,\" choosing between a career in medicine or dentistry. \"Part of what made me go the dental route was some research I did at the Empire State Plaza's Wadsworth Labs,\" he notes. \"Junior year, I wanted to do some research and round out my CV and graduate school applica-tion. One of my professors put me in contact with Dr. Carmen Mannella, who was researching a cancer drug, Adriamycin, to deter - mine its toxicity to the heart and how to prevent it. I'd take the bus downtown and hang out in the basement - 'the dungeon,' I called it - and the research did round me out. It was intense, very finite, very detailed, which I was not used to. Dr. Mannella let me run with it, and he got some grant money for further study. I was paid for about 10 hours of work a week, and I did earn graduate credits my senior year.\" The work also convinced Capolongo that \"I could never do research. I decided on dentistry.\" His \"strong\" background in the sciences \"got me into Columbia University's College of Dental Medicine. I even received a scholarship, which paid 50 percent of my tuition.\" Capolongo met his wife, Gina, a pediatric dentist, at Columbia. After graduation, they moved to Westchester County, sensing the area \"would prove to be a good opportunity. We've been here for 21 great, super, wonderful years,\" he says. While Albany prepared him well for his career, Capolongo notes that even his treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma had a University connection. His doctors prescribed Adriamycin - the very same pharmaceutical Capolongo researched as an undergraduate. \"It was surreal, in many ways,\" he admits, adding that he's now \"15 years cancer free.\" The Long Island native is proud of the University and his fellow graduates. \"We have strong alumni; we all have fond memories of Albany and its history and vibrancy. I had a great college experience and the educational greatness that got me down the road to my profession. When you combine the two, what more can you have? It was a win-win situation.\" For Capolongo, \"the college conversa- tions are just starting now\" with his oldest child, Catie, who turns 16 in September. \"It's a matter of seeing what would be right for her. I could see my daughter enjoying both academics and entertain- ment on campus. Albany will be on our list when we start looking at schools - absolutely, it will. I came out of there with complete happiness. \"The opportunities at the University are immense,\" says Capolongo, who is also the father of 12-year-old twins Genevieve and Lauren. \"I enjoyed being there. I took a year off after college and stayed in Albany; it's a great town. It's a fun place and has easy access to many other places - Saratoga, Lake George, skiing at Gore Mountain. It really was great.\"Neil Capolongo, D.D.S., B.S.'85 University Ambassador Capolongo encourages his young \"all the time\" to consider attending UAlbany. Mike Tritchonisby Carol OlechowskiSince joining Shanghai United Family Hospitals and Clinics (SHU) staff as chief medical officer in December 2008, pediatrician T yrone Bristol has had ample opportunity to incorporate into his practice \"preventative healthcare for the community, which I learned while getting my M.P .H. at UAlbany.\" The past four years \"have gone by quite rapidly\" for the School of Public Health alumnus, who earned undergraduate and M.D. degrees from Cornell Uni-versity and Albany Medical College, respectively. \"In addition to enhancing SHU standards with guidelines and policies, we've expand-ed healthcare services, such as diabetes and respiratory care, smoking cessation, sports medicine and adoles-cent care. We now have a consistent internal medical-education program for our staff and a significant outreach program to help educate our community on such topics as the dangersof lead poisoning and poor air quality. I've been able to continue one of my professional passions: educating teenagers and parents about teen health risks, including the use of alcohol and other drugs, and unhealthy sexual behaviors. \"Our staff and organization continue to grow, with new hospitals and clinic projects. We are proud to have been reaccredited by the Joint Commission International (JCI) in 2011 for another three years. We still have many goals for the Shanghai organization, and I look forward to being part of it.\" Even as Bristol's hospital-administrator role has expanded, \"I've been able to build a pediatric practice in the very limited amount of time I have to see patients. I've learned many cultural and ethnic nuances of pro-viding healthcare to kids from all over the world. I've had weekly Mandarin lessons since February 2009; I just started learning some medical Mandarin, and also how to write the characters. Personally, I was happy to become a Certified Physician Executive (CPE) in March.\" Life hasn't been all work and no play for the Guyana-born Bristol, who immigrated to the U.S. as a teenager: \"I continue to enjoy traveling and exploring other parts of Asia, such as Japan, Korea and Thailand.\" Tyrone G.

They created Global Health in the Middle East and Central Asia, an HIV/AIDS training program for regional health experts. And they founded a clinic where they treated, educated and offered emotional support to patients and families. After Mahmoud Ahmadinejad became president, however, the government withdrew its support for their work. During a visit home by Kamiar, then a School of Public Health intern travel-ing to conduct research at the family's clinic, both physicians were arrested and held for several months without being charged. Finally, at a secret trial Dec. 31, 2008, Arash and Kamiar were charged with \"communications with an enemy\" and seeking to overthrow the government under Article 508 of Iran's Islamic Penal Code. At a press confer - ence, Iranian Judiciary spokesperson Ali-Reza Jamshidi claimed the broth-ers were \"linked to the CIA, backed by the U.S. government and State Department. ... They recruited and trained people to work with different espionage networks to launch a velvet overthrow of the Iranian government.\" Three weeks after the one-day trial, on Jan. 20, 2009, Kamiar and Arash were informed that they had been convicted. Arash was sentenced to six years at T eh-ran's infamous Evin prison; Kamiar was sentenced to three years there but was released in December 2010. Arash was freed in August 2011. Their work has earned the physicians many tributes. The most recent came July 21, during the opening ceremonies of the XIX International AIDS Confer - ence in Washington, D.C., when they received the Elizabeth T aylor Award \"in Recognition of Efforts to Advocate for Human Rights in the Field of HIV .\" Arash is now adviser for International Education at UAlbany.

She thinks this is what drew her to the field of imaging. \"Everything I do is really a puzzle,\" explained Katz, the chief of Ultrasound at Tufts Medical Center in Boston. \"I have to look at the situation, the images we collect, and put the puzzle together.\" In addition to overseeing the ultra- sound department and reading scans such as x-rays, CT-scans and mammograms, Katz is an assistant professor at Tufts University School of Medicine. She enjoys the teaching part of her job because it ensures that she is constantly learning. \"I like being a student for life,\" she said. Katz chose the University at Albany because of its proximity to her downstate New York family. She has fond memories of working in the biology labs - a precur - sor, of sorts, to her work in imaging. \"I enjoy being behind the scenes, working collaboratively with other professionals to solve a problem,\" Katz noted. \"When you know you've helped someone, it's an extraordinary feeling.\"Judith Katz, M.D., B.A.'72 For The Love Of Puzzles By Jim Sciancalepore, M.A.'93 Neil Gordon, M.D., B.S.'86 Facing Forward \"I make people's outsides match what's inside,\" explained Neil Gordon. Gordon is one of the nation's preeminent facial plastic surgeons and a leader in the breakthrough technique known as the 'deep plane facelift' - a way to make patients' faces appear younger without looking like they've had work done. \"It's very artistic,\" said Gordon, describing his work. \"And it has a very positive effect on people's lives, their confidence and self-image.\" Gordon, who practices at office locations in Connecti - cut and in Manhattan, is founder of The Retreat at Split Rock, a unique facility that offers state-of-the-art plastic surgery in a private, spa-like atmosphere.Beyond his private practice, Gordon is the director of Head and Neck Aesthetic Surgery at the Yale School of Medi-cine; he also carries out other academic responsibilities. A nationally recognized author - ity on facial plastic surgery, he was even interviewed by E! Entertainment Television for a segment about celebrity facelifts. Gordon credits his UAlbany education with putting him \"in a position to succeed\" relative to medical school and other endeavors.By Jim Sciancalepore, Earl & Sodor Photographic 14 UAlbany Magazine Fall 2012 Steven M. Katz is an anesthesiologist at Christiana Health Care System in Delaware. He specializes in obstetric anesthesia. A math major and physics minor, Katz was very much influenced by his math professors at the University at Albany. \"My math training has always made me think about my assumptions about things and try to avoid memorization as a way of learning,\" he says. Instead, Katz sought to understand ideas and facts. That ap-proach shaped his pre-med education at Columbia University and his study of medicine at Hahnemann University, which is now a part of Drexel University. Katz also found value in other courses he took. Film classes with Arthur Lennig gave him a lifelong love of the movies. A class with Richard (Doc) Sauers, then head coach of the men's basketball team, gave him perspective on, and an appreciation for, the game. Katz and his sister, Judith, estab- lished the Edith and Otto Katz Scholarship at the University. \"Neither of my parents went to college, but they made it possible for us to go. So we thought it would be a fitting tribute to them to create a scholarship in their honor,\" Katz says. Steven M. Katz, M.D., B.S.

She increasingly incorporates minimally invasive sur - gery (MIS) into her practice to \"allow patients to heal and resume their normal activities more quickly.\" At the University at Albany, Ascencio was a pre-med student majoring in biology and minoring in chemis- try. \"I wanted to go to the University of Pennsylvania, but I was 16 and my mother didn't want me to go so far away,\" recalls the Jamaica native, whose family set- tled in Queens, N.Y., after immigrating to the United States. When her sister, Holly Pyke-Brown, B.S.'91, urged her to enroll at Albany, Ascencio did, and \"it worked out very well for me. Everyone there was very helpful. There was a center where we used to go for tutoring; I immediately signed up for a tutor in every class! It gave me kind of a security blanket; I was able to meet people. I met my husband, Alfredo Ascencio [B.S.'94, business administration], there.\" Although Ascencio was \"very focused on my school- work,\" her mentor and adviser, Professor Daniel Wulff, \"wanted me to be a little more socialized. He felt I worked too hard. He wanted me to have a well- rounded experience; he got me listening to opera, and he helped me to do the applications for Phi Beta Kappa and Purple and Gold. He was an inspiration.\" Ascencio, who went on to graduate from the Univer - sity of Virginia School of Medicine in Charlottesville, is \"very grateful to have been a student at Albany. The curriculum was very competitive, and I was well prepared for a dynamic career.\" By Carol Olechowski Ask Janice Krystal (Pyke) Ascencio what she most enjoys about her work, and she instantly responds, \"Being a part of other people's lives.\" 16 UAlbany Magazine Fall 2012Most of his contemporaries have retired. But at age 84, orthopaedic surgeon John H. Bowker proudly remains on the job, treating patients two days a week at Miami's Jackson Memorial Medical Center. Bowker's interest in medicine was \"awakened during the waning days of World War II,\" when he served as a U.S. Navy corpsman at St. Albans Naval Hospital in Queens, N.Y. He later studied biology at the New York State College for T eachers. The school \"was affordable for me with the help of the G.I. Bill, a New York State Veterans scholarship, and living in Albany with my parents,\" recalls Bowker. T o make ends meet, he worked weekends as a licensed practical nurse and during school breaks as \"a common laborer on the construction of the New York State Thruway and the Albany power plant.\" At NYSCT, Bowker's favorite classes were biology and history; \"the quality of the teaching was outstanding in these areas.\" Minnie Scotland, who taught several of his biology courses, and Catharine Newbold of the history department \"were outstanding teachers with a great sense of humor.\" His pro-fessors' \"high expectations for student performance\" aided Bowker in \"developing a mindset valuable for medical studies and subsequent specialty training.\" After graduating from Albany Medical College in 1956, Bowker completed a residency in orthopaedic surgery at the University of Pittsburgh and a fellowship in orthopaedic rehabilitation at Massa- chusetts General Hospital. He combined his medical training with an interest in teaching, joining the orthopaedic faculty at the University of Arkansas College of Medicine. Bowker taught there full time for 19 years, then for another 18 at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. He retired from the university in 2000, and \"the next day, I was hired by Jackson Memorial to continue my resident teaching and surgical work.\" One day each week, Bowker sees \"a large number of mostly indigent- care patients in clinics that alternate, with one devoted to preventive and therapeutic management of foot problems of diabetics, and one John H. Bowker, M.D., B.S.'52 Decades of Dedication By Carol Olechowski A Few Words of Advice \"Virtually all foot problems in diabetics result from ignoring high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period,\" says John H. Bowker. \"This results in gradual loss of protec-tive sensation in the feet, leading to the inability to recognize injuries to them until, all too often, serious infection results.\" Bowker advises diabetics never to walk barefoot or only in socks, even in their homes. to inspect their feet and shoes closely twice a day. to check their blood sugar levels daily. to have their hemoglobin A1C determined every three months to indicate the average daily blood sugar levels over this period. (\"Ideally, this level should be very close to 6 percent. Maintaining that level should greatly help prevent onset or progression of major complications, including loss of vision, kidney failure and decreased foot sensation,\" Bowker notes.) The doctor adds: \"There are millions of prediabetic persons in the United States, most of them obese. Without intervention, about 70 percent will develop T ype 2 diabetes. The most effective measure to stop that progression is by attaining a normal weight through moderate exercise and diet under the guidance of one's primary physician and a dietitian.\" dedicated to the care of persons with amputations, including the provision and maintenance of prosthetic limbs. These clinics emphasize a team approach. The second day is my surgery schedule; I address the serious problems seen in the clinics, ranging from function-preserving amputations within the foot to major lower-limb amputations.\" Bowker, who works with the Orthopaedic Rehabilitation Association and The International Society for Prosthetics and Orthotics, is a member of T echnical Committee 168 of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). He has served as an editor for the last three editions of Levin and O'Neal's The Diabetic Foot (Elsevier Publishing), \"the leading interdisciplinary work on management of diabetic foot problems for over 30 years,\" as well as for the most recent editions of the Atlas of Amputations and Limb Deficiencies, published by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. More than five decades into his career, Bowker considers his work in the clinics, in \"improving the quality of both amputation surgery techniques and the lifelong prosthetic management of persons with amputation,\" and in \"training literally hundreds of orthopaedic residents in the principles of care for these patients,\" highly rewarding.

Though they continue to nurture their love of acting and live theatre, Lisa and Kevin ultimately directed their careers to a different stage: the field of medicine.Kevin Ferentz is the chief medical officer for Baltimore Medical System, Inc. - the largest group of Federally Qualified Health Centers in Maryland - and has been recognized as one of the top family physi-cians in America. Lisa Ferentz, president and founder of The Institute for Advanced Psychotherapy and Training, Inc., is an award-winning clinical social worker. Both Lisa and Kevin are longtime educa- tors, as well as published authors and sought-after speakers in their respective specialties. They can attribute some success in medicine to their background in theatre. \"My background in acting has offered me many advantages - the ability to speak in front of an audience and to connect with people on an emotional level,\" said Lisa. \"Training in the arts makes you better at what you do, no matter what profession you're in,\" added Kevin. \"It makes you a more well-rounded StarsBy 18 UAlbany Magazine Fall 2012 www.albany.edu 19 David Cohn, son of an 89-year-old World War II veteran, believes \"all people have a right to good health care, and veterans have clearly earned it.\" Through Locum T enens, a program that allows him to work \"wherever I choose, for as long as I want, depending on availability,\" he's doing his part to provide that care at the Saranac Lake and Westport, N.Y., Veterans Administration (VA) clinics. Board-certified in internal medicine with an emphasis on geriatrics, Cohn is a University of Miami School of Medicine graduate. He offered \"primary care for all adults\" at Jacobs and Cohn, M.D., P .A., in Miami, then worked solo at the practice until it merged with Elite Healthcare. Ties to UAlbany and family, and memories of summer camp at Schroon Lake, drew him to the North Country.At the VA clinic, staff treat physical ailments and \"a lot of mental illness, including post-traumatic stress disor - der (PTSD). A good support system, with social workers, psychologists and psychiatrists, is available to help the vets,\" notes Cohn, who sees five to 10 patients daily. Cohn credits Albany - \"the best school that accepted me\" - with \"mak-ing me a better person and therefore a better, more caring physician.\" He majored in psychology and minored in math, played JV and varsity baseball, and was involved with Albany Men's Intramural Athletics (AMIA). Cohn, who has taught medical profession-als and trainees, recalls \"various psych courses and statistics\" and the examples of math professor Richard Hornblower, \"who always encouraged me towards a career in medicine, and my other mentor, Robert Hicks, who taught psychology.\" Remembering \"those who contributed to me,\" Cohn supports UAlbany with donations \"mostly for the baseball team.\" He returns to Albany for the yearly alumni baseball game and re-mains a close friend of former intramural adviser Denny Elkin.

His work blends office vis- its and patient consultations with high-tech hospital procedures, such as cardiac catheterization and angioplasty - a mix that he terms \"the best of all worlds.\"Even going back to his days in pre-med at UAlbany, Kirschbaum always knew he wanted to be in the medical field. \"I liked science, and I liked taking care of people,\" he said. Kirschbaum regards his UAlbany experience as a \"good, balanced education,\" and, nearly 40 years later, maintains several close friendships formed at the University.

Josephson. His work as both healthcare provider at the Jacksonville, Fla., clinic and child advocate underscores his commitment to youngsters. Josephson, former division chief of Pediatric Otolaryngology and assistant professor of otolaryngology, pediatrics, and anesthesiology at the University of Miami School of Medicine, joined Nemours in 2000, intrigued by its \"mission of caring for children regard-less of their families' ability to pay for their care. The Nemours Foundation was set up by the late Alfred I. Du-Pont, who left a trust in perpetuity to care for all children in both Delaware, his home state, and in Florida, where he spent time vacationing.\" At Nemours, Josephson specializes in airway and sinus disease in children. His other contributions to the medical field include numerous publications, such as the 2005 textbook Complications in Pediatric Otolaryngology, often used and referenced by medical facilities and physicians. Josephson has developed several surgical instruments that bear his name and are currently used in the operating theater. He also is an associate professor of otolaryn-gology at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine. \"I feel I still have a lot to give,\" adds Josephson, whose office is filled with beautiful cards, drawings and words of appreciation from the children and families he cares for. He sits on numerous boards and committees that assure children \"receive the care they need and deserve. The clinical side of medicine is still closest to my heart. When I change a child's life medically, allowing him or her to lead a more normal life, have fun and become a productive member of society, I know I am making a difference. I feel blessed to have been given the opportunities afforded me, and I am committed to using these skill sets to give others opportunity, as well.\" Josephson's University at Albany un- dergraduate experience - he majored in biology and minored in English and psychology - \"provided a strong foundation and direction for my current career. He attended medical school at the State University of New York in Brooklyn, graduating in 1990 with honors for distinction in research. Josephson went on to do general surgery training at the Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan, then otolaryngology training at the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary. Con-vinced that his future lay in working with children and \"giving them the best opportunities for long, successful, healthy lives,\" Josephson completed a pediatric otolaryngology fellowship at the University of Virginia. Several years ago, he earned a profes-sional master's in business adminis-tration from the University of Mas-sachusetts. \"The field of medicine is changing rapidly,\" Josephson points out, and the degree \"allows me to better understand the business side of medicine. Although at Nemours we are fortunate to have a trust that supports our mission, physicians need to be more fiscally responsible as resources become tighter. We have to be able to provide more and better care, while reducing the bottom line. This is a challenge, to say the least, but it's doable.\" Josephson, who describes himself as \"very spiritual,\" has \"other passions\" aside from work: \"my wonderful wife, Patricia, a University of Florida pediatrician, and my two children, Samantha, 10; and Grayson, 7.\" He enjoys outdoor activities and is an avid competitive slalom water skier. \"The sport allows me to stay focused, physically fit and well balanced,\" Josephson says.

Much of his work \"is based on computer design\" and recalls Sultan's years at the University at Albany, where he took one of the first computer science courses offered. \"A lot of what I do now is also based on my training in organic chemis- try. Even the development of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), integral to my diagnoses, is based on research using early Nuclear Magnetic Resonance technology developed in the chemistry department when I was an undergrad,\" the Brooklyn, N.Y., native notes. \"At the time I graduated, I was gung ho on research and planned to obtain a Ph.D.,\" remembers Sultan, a Board Certi- fied Diplomate of the American Board of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery in private practice since 1989. \"I worked for one of my professors, Dr. Henry G. Kuivila, an organic chemist. I was interested in being an industrial research chemist, so I took the graduate school entrance exam and got accepted to seven organic chemistry Ph.D. programs across the country.\" After a year at Penn State, \"I realized that research was not the right path for me. I was more of a people person.\" Sultan's people skills led him to dentistry, and eventually to a career in oral and maxillofacial surgery. He graduated in the top 5 percent of his class at the University of Maryland Dental School, and completed an internship at Jackson Memo- rial Hospital in Miami and his residency at New York City's Mount Sinai Medical Center. Licensed in both Florida and New York, Sultan is affiliated with Broward General Medical Center, where he performs the majority of his surgeries and is a member of the T rauma and Sleep Disorders T eams. A past director of Broward's Cleft Palate Program, he also cares for the county's indigent population and volunteers for surgical missions to underdeveloped countries. Away from the surgical suite, Sultan runs; does Pilates; plays guitar and tennis; and is \"the proud dad\" to his rescue dog and cat. Sultan, a Nova Southeastern University professor who supervises the training of future surgeons, enrolled at Albany because \"it was a great school with a great reputation. I had a lot of friends who were going there, and it was very affordable. Plus, Albany had a really good health sciences program.\" Sultan still keeps in touch with fellow alumni, including Eric Lobel, M.D., B.S.'80, an anesthesiologist in Alabama, and New York City businessman Steven Schapiro, B.S.'80. Albany, he adds, was \"a great stepping stone to where I am now. Looking back at my career, I wouldn't have done anything different.\"Leslie H.

He took one course a semester; his concentration was in epidemiology. As a doctor, Back saw that public health and clinical medicine rarely interact. \"Clinicians see a problem in one way, and public health officials see it in another,\" he observes. \"They speak different languages, and even though pub- lic health and clinical practice should be more closely melded, they often are not.\" After attending medical school in Buffalo and completing his resi- dency at the University of Rochester, Back spent the next four years working in public health with the Indian Health Service and the Centers for Disease Control. Since 1991, Back has been a physician in Schenectady. Now, he is the associate director of the Family Medicine Resi- dency at Ellis Hospital. The practice serves low- income patients and is a training site for residents. Back's patients include some of the several thou- sand Guyanese immigrants who settled in Sche- nectady within the past two decades. He noticed that they \"have a high incidence of diabetes\" that \"didn't look like other diabetes.\" The adult-onset T ype 2 form of the disease, Back notes, tends to show up in older people and obese people, but that was not the case with the Guyanese. He organized a research study that confirmed the rate of this diabetes, at about 30 percent of adults, was significantly higher than that of other populations. The Schenectady County Public Health Department obtained a grant from the Centers for Disease Control to address this problem. Back hopes to inspire others to view clinical problems from a public health perspective - and to have public health officials examine situations from a clinical viewpoint. He's succeeded with at least one person: his daughter Rebecca, who earned her M.P .H. in medical school. She is now a family medicine resident in Rhode Island. ephraim Back, M.D., M.P.H.'06 Melding Public Health and Clinical Practice By Amy Halloran, B.A. '90 Allan Greissman, M.D., was - at one time - Allan Greissman, business major. He credits his faculty advisors at UAlba- ny for encouraging him to think beyond the traditional application of his degree in business administration -- and to pur - sue his interest in medicine. \"They were 100 percent behind me,\" remembered Greissman. \"And that meant a lot to me at the time.\"As it turns out, this business background would serve Greissman well in his medi-cal career. He is currently president of Pediatric Critical Care of South Florida - a position that combines both medical care and administration. \"I love that I get to practice medicine and, in particular, get to help children and families,\" Greissman said. \"But I also love that I am able to nurture my entrepreneurial side, too.\"Allan Greissman, M.D., B.S.'83 Where Business Meets Medicine By Jim Sciancalepore, M.A.'93 Ronald Frasch, B.S.'70 Merchandising Maven If Saks Fifth Avenue President and Chief Merchandising Officer Ron Frasch had a career objective when he was 17, \"it wasn't the fashion industry.\" He initially attended Ohio Uni-versity to study journalism. After considering finances and proximity to home, however, the Glens Falls native transferred to what was then SUNY Albany and opted for a business major instead. \"I was very proud to be accepted at Albany,\" recalls Frasch. \"T o be able to succeed in a very com-petitive environment was really important.\" That setting, combined with \"extremely talented professors and extremely bright students,\" reinforced his determination \"to get my degree and find a job.\" Frasch did both, but it took him a while to settle into the right career. Senior year, he had sold mutual funds, and when he graduated, \"I started doing that full time. But I was not very good at it, and I really didn't like it.\" Frasch interviewed elsewhere but \"couldn't find a job.\" Eventually hired at Bloomingdale's as a tempo-rary seasonal employee, he found he enjoyed \"the people aspect\" of merchandising enough to make it his career. Frasch has spent all of his 40 years in the business, including the last eight, with Saks Fifth Avenue. He has also held executive-level positions with Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman. At Saks, Frasch uses the teamwork and time-management skills he acquired at UAlbany. Working \"arm in arm\" with CEO Steve Sadove, he is \"responsible for all the merchandising and merchandise planning, and all the stores report to me. I also have respon- sibility for store-planning functions, the overall look of our stores and any construction that goes along with renovating them. Steve and I do everything else together.\" Frasch also works with several UAlbany alumni, \"all very good people in our industry. They are driven to be successful. That's something very special, and I'm very proud of my fellow graduates. \"I love the people, developing and mentoring them,\" adds Frasch. \"The business is very stimulat-ing and constantly new. I enjoy the dynamic of an ever-changing environment, whether it's product, people or plans. I don't think two days have ever been the same in my entire career. I love what I do.\" www.albany.edu 25By Carol OlechowskiAsk Geoff By Archivist 26 UAlbany Magazine Fall 2012For centuries, the property where UAlbany's uptown campus is situated has been surrounded and cut through by east-west transpor - tation routes and various streams. In the 1800s and early 1900s, the proper - ty's south side was drained by a stream rising from a kuyl (Old Dutch for \"pit\"), or, depending on the authority, possibly the east branch of the Kromme (Old Dutch for \"crooked\") Kill (Dutch for \"stream\") or the Hunger Kill under the Great Western T urnpike, which is Western Avenue today. A branch of the Patroon Creek, which flowed under - and sometimes over - Washington Avenue drained the north side. Long ago, Native Americans portaged canoes from the Mo- hawk River, where Schenect-ady is now, to the Hudson at what became Albany, avoiding the falls at Cohoes. This path offered refreshment from the spring-fed waters of the kuyl, or Hunger Kill (supposedly the best water in the region), making the location an ideal resting point for travelers. Not surprisingly, the King's Highway, a two-rut wagon track between Albany and Schenectady, followed the Na-tive American trail across what would become the uptown campus. Old Roads Running through the Albany Country Club Property, a 1940s map William Efner based on a 1760s map of the area, shows successive taverns being estab-lished beside the kuyl (Efner spelled it \"Knil\") on the King's Highway, just north of UAlbany's Campus (Indian) Pond. According to Efner's map, Ritch-es T avern, located 5 miles from down-town Albany and also known as Five Mile T avern, existed by 1760. Within 20 years, McKown's T avern rose on the same site, near where Indian Quad now stands. When the Western T urnpike was established, diverting traffic from the King's Highway, McKown built a second tavern south of the intersection of Fuller Road and Western Avenue in what is now McKownville. In 1889, a private group purchased the old roadhouse located approximately where Indian Quad is, intending to transform the parcel into a fox-hunting club. The plan proved unpopular; the club held Saturday afternoon teas - and apparently little else. Membership declined, and the group reorganized in 1893 as the Albany Country Club (ACC). A year later, the Knowlton Es-tate, a large Western Avenue property, was added to the tavern parcel, and a clubhouse and golf course were built. The new country club quickly won the support of prominent Albanians, including the Van Rensselaer, Pruyn, Sage and Lansing families. The popular venue also offered tennis courts, and later, swimming and skating on the kuyl/kill, which was dammed by a 300-foot earthen-and-wooden dam in exactly the location where Indian Pond is situated today. On the high hillock to the west, directly across from what is today SEFCU Arena, was the Billy Barnes Hunt- ing Lodge. Built in 1905, the lodge was owned by the chairman of the Albany Republican Machine, which controlled Albany until the O'Connell Democrats took over in 1920. Barnes was a grandson of Thurlow Weed, a state and national leader of the Whig Party and a founder of the Republican Party. The Albany Council of Churches purchased the lodge in the late 1960s; until it burned in 1985, the building housed a chapel house for the new campus. It was replaced by the current Chapel House at the bottom of the hill.

The clippings are from the Times Union and University Archives, respectively. at Albany was difficult. Even though the ACC sold off parcels of its property along Western Avenue, country club members, at least publicly, were reluctant to sell. At one point, then-Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller threatened to move the new Edward Durell Stone-designed campus to the Helderbergs or Saratoga Springs, depriving the City of Albany of revenue from the new University. Eventually, the parties arrived at a fair price, but the troubles contin-ued: As bulldozers reshaped the land, ACC members continued to play their course. T o prevent being hit by errant golf balls, construction crews cut down trees and piled them in front of the greens. More havoc ensued in March 1963, when the old country club pond retaining wall collapsed. Fifteen million gallons of water, huge chunks of ice and trees cascaded across Western Av-enue into homes and businesses - stranding one homeowner's car in a tree blocks away. The dam was repaired and reinforced, and the pond remained. Within a year (Fall 1964), stu- dents would begin moving into Dutch Quad, and, by 1966, the first courses would be offered on the uptown campus. Shortly thereafter, University at Al- bany students and faculty began walking the old trail beside the Hunger Kill.The ACC is seen, right, in this 1910 Albany Country Club Constitution picture, courtesy New York State Library. Far right, Chapel House was once located in the old hunting lodge pictured in this University Archives photo. The building was destroyed by fire in 1985, and a new Chapel House was built nearby. 48 A note from your class councilor: The following classmates replied to me when they first received news of a possible reunion of all of the classes of the 1940s: Marjorie Lotz Backlund, Isabel Cooper Baker, Ruth Seelbach Lucille St. Priest Horton, Annalee Levine Ginsberg, Dolores Shindelman Grossman, Ruth Hurr, Beverly Free McCarthy, Clare Creeden McCracken, Wanda Tomasik Methe, Todt, Phyllis Yerdon Van Alstine, and Eloise Butler Worth.

Edie represented much of the best we seek in each of us; solid, dependable, always there, unassuming, she was a good person who contributed much to our class, our college and her community. She was proud to be a farmer's daughter and a farmer's wife, but was much more. We will always be in her debt. After serving on an aircraft carrier in the Pacific until May 1946, Irwin Baumel enrolled at NYSCT; he graduated cum laude and was honored with membership in Signum Laudis. In 1960, he and Nan Mechanic were married, and he began working on his master's at State. His first job, as a chemist, was with the Navy at Annapolis and then at the Picatinny Arsenal. During those years they had two daughters, Cheryl and Robin. A career change took them to Whittier, Calif., and a partnership in an electrical contracting company specializing in wiring tract houses right in time for the housing boom. Irwin bought a 40-acre parcel of land in San Diego County; cleared it; installed grove roads and an irrigation system; and planted 3,300 Hass avocado trees. In 1990, when labor problems took the fun out of farming, he sold the grove and concentrated on building, in Norwalk, Calif., six concrete tilt-up industrial buildings which he still owns and which are now managed by his older daughter, a C.P .A. Irwin and Nan traveled extensively in Western Europe until her death in 1990. He also had a rewarding hobby raising orchids. In the fall of 2010, he invited classmate Elise deSeve Brown to travel with him to Chile and Argentina; the trip sparked a long-term relationship. They traveled to Italy and bumped into Sparky Vaughn in Florence. They have also seen him in Washington, D.C., where Elise lives. They just returned from three weeks in Spain and will spend the summer in Whittier, where Irwin lives. After her husband, Lyle Walsh, died in 1994, Jeanne Bowen Walsh continued square dancing; kept the Oxford Senior Citizens Center (N.Y.) going; and spoiled her nine grandchildren, whenever allowed. Her joy was driving her camping van to the Adirondacks to see Lila Lee Harrington. They took many trips to New England, New Brunswick and even to Nova Scotia. After 2000, Jeanne married her square dance partner and moved eight miles to Norwich, N.Y. Their home is large and the grounds are beautiful, \"So stop in.\" Her growing family is scattered. They converged at a bed and breakfast in Cooperstown for the Christmas Celebration. No great-grandchildren - yet.

Audrey Koch Feathers and the Feathers family have established a memorial garden on their property on Jenny Lake in memory of Richard (Dick) Feathers, also a 1950 classmate and our freshman class president. Jenny Lake is in the Glens Falls, N.Y., area, near the village of Corinth, close enough to Queensbury, where Audrey now lives, to permit extensive visits and family outings, especially on holidays, when Audrey \"cooks up a storm.\" She also shares her home cooking with two families to provide an occasional alternative to \"meals on wheels,\" on which they are otherwise dependent. Lila Lee Harrington moved into the Prestwick Chase independent living facility in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., and was quite ill. She is happy to be able to report that, following numerous hospitalizations and tests, a diagnosis led to a cure, and she is now in robust health. Lila's environment offers a myriad of opportunities, and she takes full advantage of them: an in-house newspaper; a book chat club; a poetry club; interaction with Skidmore College students; the Ladies Breakfast Club; aerobics; and a shuttle bus to events at Skidmore College, the Saratoga Performing Arts Center, Proctor's Theater in Albany, and other theaters in the area. In her spare time, she collects stamps, handwrites notes for family and friends, and enjoys taking close-up photographs.

It isn't a plaque or a monument, but a place where they gather to enjoy fellow-ship, reminisce about their student days and plan for the University's future. It's the Alumni House, a home away from home for graduates of the former New York State College for T eachers (NYSCT) and its successor institutions, including the University at Albany. Forty years ago, planning for the Alumni House Conference Center gave rise to the Annual Fund, which brought alumni together to raise the $175,000 necessary to construct and furnish the 6,300-square-foot building. The yearly tradition of supporting a specific Uni-versity project or need continues today through the UAlbany Fund. William Floyd, B.A.'54, M.A.'55, and Henry M. Madej, B.A.'67, M.P .A.'68, were successive chairs of the Alumni House Conference Center Committee from 1972 to 1976. The project had \"two purposes,\" Madej recalled: \"to pro-vide a home on the uptown campus for alumni and to help the University begin to raise money for itself. There was a need to have something that would be a draw and ease people into the concept of giving to the University. \"One of the problems we had was that most of the alumni, especially those who had attended the University more than a few years before, didn't particularly associate with the new campus. My class, even, and we went through 'the great transition': We were the first to have classes consistently on the new campus and the second to graduate from there. We wanted a place where all alumni could come and feel at home.\" At the time, \"the Alumni Association had a small two-room suite on the first floor of the Administration building on the uptown campus,\" remembered Floyd, a former educator and adminis-trator now retired from the New York State School Boards Association. As demand for space grew on campus, it became apparent that the association needed a permanent home. Floyd and University administrator Clifton C. Thorne '40 debated various options, eventually agreeing that \"the only viable alternative was to raise money and build quarters for the association.\" Madej credited his predecessor for doing \"a yeoman's job. Once Bill finished the hard work, like choosing an architect, I followed up.\" In addition to raising funds, committee members \"handled various communications to the Alumni Association board and details concern-ing design, the groundbreaking and the opening.\" Madej smiled as he remem-bered, \"I was responsible for the purple and gold chairs.\" One design component unusual for the time - solar panels - \"got us a little fame 32 UAlbany Magazine Fall 2012 A souvenir mug, left, and an Alumni House Conference Center model, above, recall the fundraising and design processes that brought the center to fruition.The Alumni House A Home Away From Home by Carol Olechowskiwww.albany.edu 33for our scientific prowess before the University became known for nanotechnology,\" joked Madej. According to the January 1976 Carillon, University at Albany Archivist Geoff Williams said, two 4,000-gallon water tanks and one mile of copper tub-ing went into the assembly of the solar array. Grants from Niagara-Mohawk, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) and the University's Atmospheric Sciences Research Center (ASRC) supported its construction. The location of the Alumni House, Floyd noted, \"was changed from a knoll on the eastern side of the campus to its present site to accommodate the solar collectors.\" Floyd and Madej were on hand May 18, 1974, for the groundbreaking and in May 1976, when University Presi-dent Emmett Fields and Eunice Baird Whittlesey '44 cut the ribbon for the Alumni House grand opening. In addition to providing quarters for the Alumni Association, the building, according to Williams, included a first-floor Rathskeller named with a $10,000 donation from the Potter Club. The Phi Delta and Kappa Delta sororities each raised $10,000 to name rooms on the second floor, and \"a number of classes also gave gifts. Professor Emeritus Arvid Burke '28, '30, made a special pledge to establish the Arvid Burke Library on the first floor. The large reception room upstairs was named for Bertha Brimmer, longtime Alumni Association secretary.\" Floyd, who still regards the downtown campus as \"my school,\" doesn't visit the Alumni House very often but has \"always felt welcome\" there. \"The staff has always been helpful, courteous and friendly whenever I have dropped by or called,\" he said. Although Madej doesn't get to the Alum- ni House \"as much as I used to,\" he likes the building. \"The style is contemporary; it's consistent with the rest of the campus, but it's not more white concrete. It's part of the unbroken thread of the campus, and it works for each of its intended purposes.\" Project milestones included the May 1974 groundbreaking, above; the construction process, near right; the May 1976 grand opening, center right, with Joy Longo '54, Univer - sity President Emmett Fields, and Eunice Baird Whittlesey '44, and, far right, Town of Guilderland Supervisor Carl Walters enjoying the moment; and the completed building, above right.

Rhoda Riber Mones and her husband, Mel, celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary June 10. The happy occasion took place at their yacht club near their home in San Diego. At the time of forwarding information about the upcoming event, they planned to share their joy with about 60 family members and friends, including classmate Renee Harris Barger. Rhoda was among those who lamented the passing of former class counselor Edie Minch Noeltner; \"She was such a vital, active member of the class.\" This past winter Joan Peterson Engelbosch took a cruise on the Queen Elizabeth, from New York through the Panama Canal, along the West Coast to Pago Pago, American Samoa, Hawaii, and then on to New Zealand and Australia. Before she left, Joan received the sad news that classmate Joan Erlandson Field Viele had passed away in the fall. After graduation, Joan Peterson and Joan Erlandson both went to teach in Roscoe, N.Y., and shared an apartment there. Earline (Ken) Thompson Sorensen wrote that her recent college memories have largely centered on her dear friend Edie Minch Noeltner, who died last year. At our 50th class reunion, Edie, our class councilor for many years, received the Distinguished Alumni Award for her remarkable record of community service. This recognition by SUNY was very meaningful to Edie. Ken's four children are healthy and gainfully employed. Her five grandchildren are her constant pride and delight. Ken continues to spend her \"extra pennies\" on travel and, at of this writing, was planning her next adventure, a tour of the four Scandinavian countries. When not traveling, Earline does tai chi at the Y; walks an hour or more every day; plays golf; and, every so often, meets over lunch with classmates Florence Blasco Foster and Alice Casey Reynolds, both of whom live in nearby Seneca. \"If any of you are in the beautiful Finger Lakes region, do call; I'd love to see you and promise not to talk every minute about the grandkids.\" Harold (Sparky) Vaughn's oldest daughter, Karen, spent most of April in what has become the family apartment in Florence, Italy, providing an opportunity for an in-depth visit to the city that played a central role in the Italian Renaissance. Her daughter, Christine, joined her for a week. Christine spent a year in Florence studying architecture. Sparky plans to spend a month in Florence early in the fall. The eighth great-grandchild and second great-granddaughter was born in May.

Theater must run in that family, as Melissa's husband, Gary, and son, Matthew, both appeared in the Schenectady Light Opera Company production of Hairspray. Mary Borys Coro writes that she and husband Don have been traveling as much as possible in their motor home, attending weddings, graduations and births of great-grandchildren. They have seven, with another due in September. Two granddaughters will be off to college this fall, one to the University of Iowa and one to the University of Texas at Austin. She and Don have been on two cruises in the past 14 months, one to the Panama Canal, the other a Circle Hawaii cruise. Though Mary is unable to attend our 60th reunion, she sends her best to those who remember her - as though we could ever forget her! Vickie Eade Eddy's big news concerns her son Chris, who, on Feb. 17, 2012, was promoted to the rank of one-star general in the Air Force Reserves. He was honored as \"special guest\" in the Memorial Day parade in Olean, N.Y., his hometown. He and his family now make their home in Weston, Fla., where he and his wife work for the FBI.

He says the people down there have become his \"extended family,\" and it sounds as though the hotel where he stays is his \"home away from home.\" Helen Pilcher Terrill is looking forward to her first trip abroad when she leaves May 26 for Israel. She will be going with her son, Ed, and his wife, Carol, plus their daughter Helen and Helen's cousin. Helen is also looking forward to our September reunion.

They are very happy to be back in this area and may shorten their usual Sarasota, Fla., stay in order to spend more time in their new home. Joan Bennet Kelly writes that her eldest granddaughter has landed the role of Ophelia in a Central Park production of Hamlet. She also had two bit parts in \"Broadway Empire\" on HBO last winter. Their freshman granddaughter at Springfield College had some playing time on the lacrosse team, which won its league. Joannie and Charlie are hoping to host some of our classmates who will be in the area for our 60th reunion. Sounds like a great time! Jean Faville Smith and Smitty are also planning to attend our reunion, and Jean is spreading the word that this is the reunion to attend.

And certified personal fitness trainer and author Dana Melvin wants to inspire African-American women to become phat. T o that end, the former Buffalo Bills wide receiver penned PHAT & FIT: The Ultimate Workout for Women of Color (Booklogix Publishing Services, 2011) to \"shed light on cultural differences pertaining to African-American wom- en\" while motivating readers to adopt a healthier lifestyle. Melvin pinpoints physical differences that distinguish black women's body types from those of other races, and examines the social and lifestyle factors that often influence eating habits and physical activity levels. He takes note of issues, such as health problems and stress, that must be taken into account when an individual makes diet and fitness changes. PHAT & FIT also includes recipes, as well as descriptions and illustrations of exercises. Melvin's interest in health and fitness was piqued at the University at Albany, where he majored in Africana studies and minored in medical anthropology. His anthropology classes made him think about \"human health and its cultural distinctions\" and about sharing that knowledge with others. As president/owner of Dana's T otal Fitness in Maryland and Georgia and a longtime physical education teacher and coach in both states, Melvin remains committed to his \"quest to mold the lives of children and save lives.\" His newest enterprise, a business venture with WellSpa, opened last year in Atlanta, where the native New Yorker resides with his family.
